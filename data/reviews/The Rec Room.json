{"text":"I was taken here by my girlfriend a little while ago - we had a good time but both found that it was WAY too crowded in the arcade area. She was trying to play ski-ball and would constantly pull back for her swing and hit someone in the leg, and she was TRYING to not hit people. Something else we found kind of sketchy was that we'd see large groups of drunk/drinking older guys around little kids playing the same games, just seems really weird to me.  The idea of this place is great - food with an arcade for adults/kids together. Some games pay out WAY better than others though, so i found that to be unbalanced (I won a 1000 point jackpot for 2 credits on a skill based game that I completed at almost 100% more than once, and actually got the max score twice while I was there, whereas some other games you are paying 5 or 6 credits for and maybe snagging 30 points if you're lucky).  Overall, we will go again, but they really need to expand the space between games in the arcade area - we get that you're trying to cram as much in as possible and that it probably cost an arm and a leg for the space right near the CN tower, and that the downtown core has so many people its hard to breathe sometimes, but please try to keep in mind that people need more than a foot of space to play the games. Not to mention that at least 50% of the bar/eating area was totally empty at the time."}
{"text":"Was very excited to visit this place with the family but was very disappointed. Great games but the food was horrible. Kids ordered the baseball steak which arrived burnt and inedible. I ordered the chicken which was probably the worse chicken i have ever had extremely dry and lacking of any flavour at all and the whipped potatoes were cold. A manager came by our table and apologized and said a new order was in  as 911  After about 30 mins and still no food i asked  the manager about the order he again apologized and went to follow up on the order a 2nd manager then came by to apologize and stated the food would be there in minutes we were about to just leave when they said they would take care of it on the bill. When  the food finally did arrive although better it was still not very good. One off the steaks was now under cooked and not medium as ordered and the plated was pooled in blood on the first cut which just grossed everyone at the table out. Although i did appreciate the service staff  and managers handling of the bill i would have been much happier with good food and feed kids instead i had to make other Arrangements for food."}
{"text":"I have food issues (gluten-free vegetarian), and the kitchen was more than happy to make reasonable  accommodations, which ended up being a fantastic meal! We sat far enough away from the loud arcade area with screaming kids to enjoy ourselves. :) The cocktails were great, too! The roundhouse building is gorgeous! Seriously, best portobello mushrooms ever. I wish I could hug the chef."}
{"text":"Such a cool and awesome concept! Although skeptical of trying food and thinking it would be a gimmick because it's known for its arcade, the food did not disappoint!  We took a spot on the patio and ordered the Three10 burger and 1/2 dozen of Smoky Chipotle Bbq Wings. Beware, the patio menu is limited compared to indoor seating but the view of the CN Tower and Steam Whistle Brewery was well worth it. The burger was a little over-charred but still juicy and delicious. The wings captured the Smoky flavour and was hands down one of the best wings I've had. The fries were extra crispy which I prefer and one of the best i've had. Although pricey, the service was phenomenal and was constantly checking in on us. Can't forget to mention the complementary Cineplex Movie Popcorn which the lady gave us extra! What better way to capture the Movie and Arcade vibe.   The arcade with the bar after really ties everything together and was super fun and not as busy as we anticipated. The prizes are also cool and most prizes are customized. The best part is that everything is qualified for Scene points. Definitely a fun place to check out and definitely coming back.  P.S. Don't bring in any outside liquids.. etc! For an arcade and restaurant... the security guards check you real good."}
{"text":"Poor customer service if you're looking to sit down to eat and drink. Ordered 2 beers which came 30 mins late and 1 didn't even come until we asked the waitress. Worse part is that we ordered calamari but didn't come for an hour. The waitress kept apologizing saying the food is ready but there isn't anyone to bring it out. Complained to the manager but still no action so we cancelled the order to get poutine from another food station. The calamari still came but 1 hour late and COLD. We were starving! Poutine was expensive and so were the drinks. The gaming area is too small as it was packed and hard to move around, having to wait in line to play. It's a cool place with a good concept and great location but unfortunately very disorganized. I am very hesitant to return until management improves the service."}
{"text":"After being reached out to by Betty from management at The Rec Room, she was able to adjust things and honour the reservation I had originally made for my party on fight night. We watched the fight in the hall and we were very pleased with big screen, sound and overall setup. It's seat yourself or stand with standard admission so it was a good idea to show up early to grab a seat. We ordered apps and drinks throughout the night and the popcorn chicken was a big hit. Service was pretty good for such a busy night and I was glad they also had tvs off to the side since when the fight began a lot of people were crowded around the big screen. Overall, this was a great experience and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to enjoy big games or fights. Thanks to Betty for resolving my situation and making our visit to The Rec Room a pleasurable one!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday afternoon with a group of 4 friends. We each got 100 credits plus the 60 extra credits for $25 and we doubted we were going to finish them all but within an hour and a half we had all finished our credits.We also paid for the void (the VR room) which is around $27 per person after tax. The total experience is 12 mins which includes registering, getting set up and getting instructions. It was a good experience however quite pricy for only being in the actual V.R. room for 8 mins.The actual game was new and cool as you were able to walk through rooms and touch the objects that you were seeing. Would recommend trying it just to get the experience but I don't know if I would go back simply due to the price. Huge facility but the majority of it is used for dining in and not a huge variety of games. All in all I would go back but I would recommend going during the daytime as it gets quite busy during the evening."}
{"text":"It's great to have a place like this downtown, but it seems the space could have been divided up a bit more equitably between games and dining. I found the arcade to be crowded. Went for a family outing and ate before we arrived,knowing that the food prices are a touch inflated ($20 poutine, anyone?)A $20 card gives you ample game play. Fun atmosphere. Great location."}
{"text":"The arcade games are fun but one of the major issues is kids under legal age being permitted.. Reasons why... 1) it is advertised as a bar and people are coming there for a night out atmosphere, not to be surrounded by screaming 14 year olds. It definitely ruins the appeal and mood of this place. 2) I don't fully get how its legal.. kids are not even allowed at a Boston Pizza lounge!! let alone at a place where people are walking around freely with drinks. The only difference between this and a beer garden or bar is games ! 3) as far as I understand 10pm is the time they are supposed to leave but they were there til midnight 4) Just like any drinking establishment there are some adults who come for the purpose of picking someone up.. in what way is that a kid friendly place when there are teenagers walking around plus alcohol involved ?!? How is that safe . 5) lastly kids already have their chucky cheese and movie theater arcade !! Why couldn't this just be for adults.. I don't hate kids just don't think this makes sense. You can't cater to both families with kids and a young adult crowd. This place needs to pick one or the other, otherwise both will be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Interesting concept with an arcade and a restaurant within walking distance of the CN tower & the skydome, but i will never be returning back to have a meal here. We expected the place to be great since it's in a prime location for tourism but instead we had terrible service and mediocre food.  It took the waiter 20 minutes to come and take our drink & food order, we ordered at the same time in fear that he would take 20 more minutes to return to take our food order. We started our meal with a pretzel that was not fully cooked and when we finally got our entrees it was mediocre food. After our meal we sat there for another 15 minutes for the waiter to come back to our table to give us our bill and take payment."}
{"text":"Service is really bad. We waited an hour for our food, and when checked with our waitress she said she has no idea what's going on.  The manager  came and apologized for the wait time, he said he will rush our order, which means our food is not cooked during the 1 hour wait, and our waitress did not even noticed. After the manager came we waited another 20 mins for the food. Won't come again and definitely would not recommend this restaurant.  Ps. The restaurant is not busy during that time."}
{"text":"When we got there it was cool, we were excited to play some games and have some drinks. When we bought our game tickets they gave us a receipt and say fill out the survey and you'll get a coupon for $10 off at the restaraunt (super cool right). Well we filled out the survey and it said Thank You. Talked to the guy who told us that (because we were supposed to get a code). He send us to a manager who said i dont know what he's talking about and sent us to another manager who wasn't there.... whatever not a big deal lets get a drink and play some games. Oh wait all the good games upstairs (pool tables, shuffle board) are all reserved even tho nobody is using it. Ok lets try back downstairs. You end up standing in line to play games. Drinks and food were meh. Just a new version of shanks with about 1000 children and parents runny around and screaming."}
{"text":"Huge space filled with spiffy new arcade cards made for kids and adults! Pretty cool because you can buy alcoholic drinks and snacks and walk around. There is a lot of space to sit and eat right beside the arcade area. Not a wide selection of shooting or driving games , but there are a few. There are more app like games such as flappy bird, candy crush, etc. They also have a cool ghostbusters virtual reality game which feel... so real!! It's a lot of fun and I'd definitely recommend trying it once! I hope they make another scenario soon!"}
{"text":"Arcade is good, a fun, well ventilated and clean place. Restaurant takes FOREVER to bring out the food. The place is swarming with staff members including waitresses and waiters but it took almost 50 minutes to get our food!! If you or your kids/guests are hungry - beware!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I went to the bar area and 1 of the  bartender did not greet or in any form  acknowledge us we waited at least 5 mins it may not seem long but to be able to walk by us at least 6x you'd  think we'd get noticed, made us wonder if the bar was closed that guy just really disliked his job. Thank God someone came and helped us with our drinks it might  have been the manager he was wearing a colored dress shirt different from the other staffs. But if it wasn't for him I would have given a really bad rating because of mr.grumpy but I cant just base it on one single person. Because  Other than  that useless grumpy miserable looking  bartender the other staffs were pretty nice and the security people were amazing and  manager did his job right, to insure we got the service we deserve manager knows what costumer service is about. Thank you.  We had an amazing time"}
{"text":"Ummm best place in Calgary yes. It's so much fun to come here on a weekend or weekday to play some old school games as well as win prizes. I like how they young and old there it makes the environment  so much fun. It can get super busy so the best time to come is before dinner they have a lot of staff which is awesome and the prizes are fun to. I wish they would make one closer down south since it is so far but the hours make it easy to stay later. If your bored and want to do a date night try this place out lots of fun. The food isn't something I recommend just cause it's so expensive but there is a McDonald's across the street thank god for that. They also have a charging dock station which is nice to have and the staff are helpful if you need assistance me and my bf lost our band and they found it for us! Thanks rec room !"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Wonderful staff. Delicious food. Happy to happen upon this place! New place - still working out some kinks but they were so accommodating and polite during the process.   Wonderful! Games looked fun but all we did was eat."}
{"text":"Food was not very good, which just goes to show how looks can be deceiving. Probably won't go back here for food again."}
{"text":"Rather mediocre and way overpriced for the quality of the food.  We ordered drinks and the quantity was laughable.  Not a good value.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for the first time, food was ok and the games were certainly fun but the overall service was terrible to say the very least. We waited close to 25 minutes before we were asked if we would like a beverage. This came after I had to go to the bar and ask the girl working if I could get some service. After she rolled her eyes, as it appeared I was an inconvenience to her as she was more interested in watching her Minnesota Vikings play then to service a paying customer, she got us what was by far the most inexperienced and unprofessional waiter in there. When he brought our food, he knocked over my beer and tosses me napkins like it is my job to clean it up. A few seconds later, he comes back and says :\"Sorry guys, I really f*cked up there\". Not very professional etiquette if you ask me. The table hadn't even been cleaned off yet and another waitress places our food on the table-even though it hadn't been cleaned up yet. I told her to wait a moment as she can clearly see we were cleaning a beer spill. Well apparently her sighing was another indication that she had better things to do. I can certainly tell this this place has a giant area for improvement and a serious lack of good management. I will certainly not be returning here or referring this place to anyone. Management is more than welcome to reach out to me for some training on how to manage properly as it lacks in that area."}
{"text":"It's a child caught between two worlds, and it doesn't know how to capitalize on either of them.  Most of what I'm going to say is not new or shocking. I was disappointed with my visit to The Rec Room - though not for the reasons you expect.  Maybe I'm just spoiled, because there's been a glammed-up arcade (the Sega Playdium) that's existed in Mississauga for the better part of two decades. That business knows what it is, who its target audience is and how to effectively capitalize on either of them effectively.  The Rec Room is bizarrely offputting. It's a small arcade, high(er)-end restaurant, glorified cafeteria and some kind of upscale event space all in one. Guys in suits patrol as security while kids scream for their mothers, the venue is consumed with overbearing arcade sounds and you can barely hear yourself think, let alone enjoy this space as it was (supposedly) meant for. It's trying to be an upscale venue, but it can't escape the trappings - long lines (even for some games), kids running amok and overpriced tickets (not to mention an absurdly-overpriced VR attraction with Ghostbusters - was there anyone chomping at the bit to play that after the 2016 film bombed?).  I thought this place was some kind of club and dressed a little more formal to match, only to learn that it's anything but that. I came here with five friends and we considered ourselves fortunate to grab a table in Three10 in a matter of moments. After twenty minutes of a waitress not showing up, I took a look around and realized that you HAD to make a reservation just to get a table, and there was a line stretching out the door.  If I'm understanding this correctly, they have no protocol in place to handle people who wish to play games and eat at the restaurant afterwards without a song-and-dance just to get a table.  It wasn't helped by the fact that there is a desk right near the entrance to the restaurant that appears to be where you show up to get seated, but they just direct you elsewhere. Fed up, we ended up leaving that part.  Even then, there's nothing on the menu (from what I saw beforehand) that's much different than what's already offered at other Cineplex locations. The bizarre part is that the higher-end restaurant and the \"cafeteria\" section are right next to each other. You can purchase food from the cafeteria (with a similar selection of menu items) in moments, yet you have to sit for a long time just to get served in the classier section? Did no one realize how confusing that is for people?  The games are a mixed bag. There are some quality titles like Aliens: Extermination (a game that does not try to conform to the canon of the film series at all) and Star Wars: Battle Pod, where you can get a guaranteed 5 minutes of simulator action out per card swipe. Yet, the games are either confusingly set-up (the four player table hockey booth has a counter that starts running down for 3 minutes as soon as the first player swiped in, and the cards don't register correctly half the time) or they're easily damaged.  One game we tried had the machine take two credit amounts (6 each) from my friend, who had to go up and ask for a credit refund, while another machine got broken just from a ball hitting the edge of a tile and jarring it out of alignment.  There's a prize area, a la Chuck E Cheese and Dave & Busters, where you can refund your points for prizes, but don't hold out much hope of getting one of the uber-elite items like a designer wallet or expensive souvenir - they run upwards of 25,000.  I'm still not sure why we came here. My best friend (who suggested the place from the get-go) looked increasingly confused and embarrassed that he brought us there, and we all agreed to skip out after an hour to go to a nearby Keg. After all, if you're going to charge upwards of $20 for some menu items, you should have the atmosphere to match. This wasn't it.  I don't see myself coming back here again."}
{"text":"Amazing new spot! Lots of fun games, the food looks great (although we didn't try them), staff all seem friendly, it's the Dave and Busters of Downtown Toronto, we finally have one!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere!!! Service was a bit slow for a late afternoon. Stopped in for a drink and a snack after the aquarium. Definitely a fun spot. Drinks were mediocre along with the \"huge pretzel.\" Worth stopping in at least to look around."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto for the day, parked in the garage downstairs that leads you directly to this place. We decided to walk in since I saw there was arcade games. The modern rustic look is beautiful. Tons of arcade games and tons and tons of tables to eat at. We had party of 3- 2 adults and 9 yo. Seated and Matt came to greet us pretty quickly. Menu is awesome, I ordered the Butchers daughter pizza which had so much flavor. Fiancee for the three11 burger with all the extras, and my 9 yo got the kids menu pizza, salad, and sundae. I was hesitant to order off the kids menu because it's never enough food but she got a personal pizza and a big salad and a big bowl of sundae. All of us loved our food and loved the place itself. Afterwards we went to play the games, mixed crowd (kids, teens, adults) but enjoyed ourselves very much. Reasonably priced, Would def recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"After a long time I found such a great place to having fun with friends and family.  I would definitely suggest this place.  If it's a nice sunny day you can sit outside in the patio and enjoy the music and food or drinks.  Inside is a game heaven it's very nice. I ordered fried calamari it was ok a little to chewy. The only thing I didn't like was the prices everything and I mean everything is overpriced.  I think they ask for to much for that the quality of food u get. Anyways I would suggest the games it is a lot of fun.  The workers are very friendly and the place is very clean. It is family friendly and good for lunch breaks to relax and fill up your energy. The only reason I just give the 4stars is because of the price and food quality. Everything else was very nice."}
{"text":"They did a good job with the ambiance if you're into Entertainment overstimulation. The place has a lot going on and is good for kids. The food is very average and the server was very slow to take Our orders. Even though there really close to where I live I don't think I go back for the arcade games, perhaps a sports game on the big screen the food on par with other sports bars."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect when I walked into this restaurant/arcade, and was pleasantly surprised.  It's a huge space which I believe was a furniture store, and before that Sears. The transformation is incredible. We were greeted upon entry by a gentleman and also were two hostesses one of which seated us at our table.   To the right is the eating area, and to the left is the arcade. It looks like there is additional seating upstairs, but I never had a chance to go and see what was actually up there, I ordered the Three ten Burger, and it was juicy and flavorful. It also came with a side of fries. My older son had a pizza, which looked tasty as well. My youngest had the chicken bites, that was on the kid's menu. It tasted good and came with gravy and the side that he chose was the garlic mashed potatoes.  All the items we tried were very good and I have to say was a nice surprise. I'll definitely be back to try what else they have on the menu.  Also the arcade has to be one of the biggest in the city. Although we didn't try the arcade out, I may have to next time when I have no time constraints. One final note. Kids are allowed in until 10:00 p.m."}
{"text":"I had high expectations when arriving here and it did not exceed. It is not massive as advertised just big (the restaurant and bar consumes most of the space ). The games area is really small and you have to wait in line to get a turn for pretty much all the games.   My favorite game and probably most is the shooting basket ball game, unfortunately there is only 3 game boxes, which is CLEARLY not enough for amount of people that line up. Most people want to wait to compete with their friends so sometimes there is box empty while hoards of people wait, or a person singly playing will say something (which is what I did and got penalized when I played an extra turn)   However the tokens to play the games are pretty cheap to say the least, but they don't have a wide variety of prizes which also sucks.  Now the bar, it's big but it only had 3 bartenders on floor , which is not enough for a Saturday night and I ended up waiting 20 min for a bartender to notice me  (mind you I kept trying to get there attention ).    I would rather take my money to Dave and Busters, where I won't feel like a sardine in a tin can filled with people just to get to and from a game.   To those who decide to come here its best to come here on a weekday or pre drink else where so you don't have to wait longer than 10 min to get a drink."}
{"text":"Insanely bad customer service. Reservation was made in person and confirmed by hostess and was not made. There was not even a courtesy phone call to follow up until I called them and they did do anything to fix the situation. Extremely disappointed in the lack of professionalism."}
{"text":"New concept | Patio | Scene Points | Food, drinks and games | Downtown Toronto  The restaurant - patio:  Opened on Canada's 150th birthday  (July 1, 2017)  You cannot bring liquid (eg. Water bottle) into the building and are subject to search by security guards.  Food delivery is quite slow here but service is good. I ordered my food at 12:14pm and it didn't come till 1:01pm. I only ordered 2 items; half a dozen of the bacob maple mustard chicken wings from the appetizers section and the Three10 Burger from the mains. It's on the pricier side too, for instance, $14/ 6 wings, $15/ burger, $23/ rotisserie chicken. The taste is decent. The wings are bigger than your typical Wild Wings size. The Fried are thick cut.  They have the water activated hot towels tablet. Also they have an outdoor ping pong table.   There's patio seating so that's not bad. Plus you can gain Scene Points from your meal.   The games inside looked new and up to date."}
{"text":"I was excited for The Rec Room to open up as I fondly remember the whack-a-mole and skee ball days of my childhood. We made dinner reservations and I had \"The Bounty\" pizza ($16) with roasted wild mushrooms, grilled potato, spinach, ricotta, parmesan sauce, lemon zest, and extra virgin olive oil. It was pretty good, but I'd say to leave out the olive oil drizzle, as the pizza itself was already quite oily. Overall, there was nothing wrong with the food, but I'm not dying to return. Our server was very nice though, and since it was the first few weeks of opening, they had a special offer for the games as well.  They provide you with a bracelet which you load up with tokens, and then you swipe the game card at the machine. A lot of the games were just adaptations of phone games (ex: flappy bird, plants vs zombies, etc) which left me feeling like I didn't have a lot to choose from. I have heard from some friends that have gone a second time, and they have changed some of their games so that there's less time to play (and therefore less points) which is disappointing to hear. I'd say the Rec Room would be a neat place to go if you haven't been before, but not somewhere I could see myself going regularly.  I was also holding a heavy winter jacket that I wanted to drop off in my car outside, but the security made me coat check it? (It was free, but the line was quite long) so I found that a bit weird."}
{"text":"Planned a casual birthday party here as it sounded like a great idea to check the newly opened arcade and a simple way to get a large number of friends to come out.  First impressions --- right at the front door I thought we were going to be bag checked as security looked so dressed up. This isn't a club, so the vibe was kind of intimidating. After walking by, it was a simple \"Welcome to Rec Room!\" People you think you would have to pay cover by the way everyone was standing.   We came here to eat and noticed a lot of empty seats so we assumed it would be easy to seat us. Once we put our request, we were told by a hostess that there were reservations and we'd need to be put on a wait list that would be an hour. We were a little confused as there were several tables that weren't filled. Also, the patio isn't part of the service area, it's just an area where people can take their drinks out and chill.   So we left a name but saw there were other food options. We noticed another booth that appeared to be for another portion of the restaurant. (which btw was 10 workers laughing and talking with their backs towards us and I had to make a gesture to get their attention... quite unprofessional). We tried to get a seat with them and we were seated after 2 minutes... Which happened to be right behind the host desk where we saw the empty seats. I'm pretty sure that was the only restaurant portion so I'm unsure why we'd have to be put on the waitlist. We brought it up to our server who was confused. Get your stuff together guys.   Food was pricey, the Three10 burger was terrible. The patties were dry and it was just mediocre. The other items seemed ok though. I had a bite of the Bison Lasagna and it was really filling and cheesey. Also you get complementary popcorn before your order arrives.   Gaming was a little difficult than I imagined. The hallways are super narrow, there wasn't anytime where I didn't have to wait for a few people to use a machine. And then you have those individuals who hog a machine even though the arcade is crowded so you should be courteous and let people behind you have a chance. It started getting more packed which resembled a club environment -- gross sticky body heat and people breaking glasses from empty beer glasses knocked over.   By the entrance is where you can purchase you tag to play games and right next to it was the redemption area for prizes. They had a very interesting selection for redemption; a little different than Dave and Busters which was good. Some of the lower end prizes I felt could be a little less in value.   If I could suggest and changes, it would be to lessen the amount of seating in the building to allow more room for the arcade games. Train the hosts/servers to be more professional... They should be attentive to customers not mingling with their friends in large groups. Tone down the security dress code... It scares people not welcomes them. And make the patio part of a seating area (since there's so much unused seating anyway which caused confusion between the staff).   Was excited that Toronto would have an arcade... But I think I'll stick to D&B in Vaughan. It's worth the drive."}
{"text":"This review is for the Three10 restaurant and not the rest of the RecRoom. Where to start, right from the host desk they were unorganized and understaffed (poor management) then you are taken upstairs which has a neat view of the place but that's all that's good about it. It feels like being in a cafeteria and for some reason they thought putting a ping pong table up there was a good idea so you spend your meal being hit by stray balls and having strangers roam around and under your table hunting for said strays. Then there's the service, horrible. Our waitress was MIA most of meal and when you did spot her, she did everything to avoid you and eye contact. I ordered an appetizer but that never showed up until the main course and refills were wishful thinking. I wouldn't recommend planning on eating here, more of a place to go if your already there and get hungry. This was quite disappointing as I've been to the Toronto location many times and absolutely LOVE IT, but this place really let's down the RecRoom brand. The food was good and that's what the two stars represent, but had to deduct 3 for service, atmosphere, and just overall poor organization"}
{"text":"Food was excellent that's for sure, games were fun too the only thing is it's a little pricey, also do not go on a Friday night you can't move in there. Finally, although the games were fun there wasn't much options to choose from and even when it's not too busy the games are so close together you can't breathe so I feel like they need a bigger space."}
{"text":"The Killer B's of the Rec Room:  Biceps/Boobs/Botox/Big Lines  Went here on a Saturday for a birthday and left with mixed feelings. On one hand, the building itself is gorgeous and the food is pretty good, on the other hand, the games area was way too packed! But more on that later...  First, we sit down for dinner (which was good), with a table to our right full of eight no-neck, roided out juice monkeys with 6 foot wide backs that caused their balloon arms to be lifted up and hang awkwardly like a scarecrow pinned to wood posts... to our left is a group of three ladies, each one older than the next, and each one with larger more Botox and filler inflated lips than the next. The oldest one looked like a duck who had its beak run over by a transport truck.   After dinner, we checked out the games section  and here I saw more exposed tween breasts than the back of Nick Carter's tour bus in the early 2000's.   Bottom line, pretty cool, decent place, but it was way too packed on a Saturday with some odd characters. Will come back after a ball game in the summer."}
{"text":"-expensive alcohol -game room is much smaller than expected ... compared to dave and busters  -mostly dining area with big Tv's -food is priced like Toronto but it took an hour to get our food and I would recommend you check to make sure you get what you ordered -have ping pong and pool tables  -have patio"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to going to the Rec Room when it came to Toronto. Now I would not even go again and I am not excited about the location that is going to open in London. We went on a Saturday at around 1pm and it was not busy yet. They have complimentary coat check.   We sat down for food. The food was good and kind of pricey. My friend got the pizza which was a good size. I had the crab dip which was a very generous portion of dip but came with 2 brocolli and 4 crostinis. We ran out of stuff to dip with, asked for more crostinis. They charged us $2 for 4 more crostinis. I was not impressed.   The gaming arcade was disappointing. All the games are cramped into the smallest space. The street fighter game was busted, some of the buttons did not work. Half of the games are boring app games like candy crush. Someone was always walking into me or banging into my back. The prize selection was poor.  Their free offer of 10$ worth of tokens for having a meal and doing their survey was nice but when we went to scan the code, it did not even work! They had to call a manager to fix it.   Honestly, Dave and Buster's or Playdium in Sauga had a wider selection of games and a much larger space. I would rather go there."}
{"text":"Just like other reviews stated it's basically a modern/hip twist on Dave & Buster's, a little bit smaller and more expensive than the D&B's I have visited though.   However, it is a nice place to hang out and play games with friends, colleagues, or even family. The food costs around $12-40 and beers/cocktails ranging from about $8-16, if I remember correctly. On that note, the cocktails we ordered were too sour and too sweet to enjoy.  My friend and I ordered the calamari which came with two unique sauces as opposed to the usual marinara sauce. Calamari was crispy and sauces were tasty. We also ordered a the little Italy pizza, which could easily make its way to my top 10 pizzas. I loved the whole garlic cloves and arugula that were topped. The ricotta cheese was also an amazing touch, more over, I enjoyed how it was made with parmesan sauce as opposed to marinara/tomato sauce.   Service was nonexistent after we got our food, no checkups no water refills, nothing. After eating, we waited for about 10-15 minutes until we saw someone walk to ask for our bill. Not to mention that the restaurant side was not busy either.   Would probably come again but it isn't my go to. I recommend going just to check it out if you're looking to play games but there's many more restaurants in Toronto you would be better off spending your money at."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place to hang out. The game area is a little smaller than I expected but overall still had some fun games. The best part was the VR - The Void, we played The Ghostbusters. A definite must try if you are gonna go. It does cost extra but I think it was worth it! Overall had fun. I didn't try the food there but I will come back to try next time!"}
{"text":"The drinks are over priced and the food is mediocre at best. If you're a gamer and actually into video games you will be disappointed, most of the gaming selection is poor and the few quality games have large lineups. We waited over an hour to play the Walking Dead game for maybe 10 minutes. The Ghostbuster VR was neat, but again overpriced and wasn't the full time promised, was a really short experience. We bought our tickets and had to comeback 3 hours later at which time they were selling tickets to anyone who came and letting them go right in. I complained and was ignored. Most of their staff seemed nice but young, inexperienced and new to the industry. The bar was run really inefficiently on a staff, service, quality and administrative level. They need to hire some managers who know what they are doing and train their staff properly.  If you want a patio with good food and drinks walk 5 mins to the waterfront and go to Amsterdam Brewery."}
{"text":"We went to the rec room for new year's eve... Or at least had planned to. Had heard that it was fun and reasonably priced, but this turned out to not be the case. The waitress was gruff about food items unavailable, seemed unimpressed that she had to serve us free popcorn because they are part of cineplex (the popcorn was stale anyway), and when she asked if the food was good, I told her\"not really\" and she just said\"cool\" and walked away. The pizza was poorly cooked, but seemed worth the $14. The steak frites ($24) were ordered medium rare, but came out burnt and over well done, with stale fries.  Thankfully a manager came by and agreed to remove the dish from our bill. Games seemed ok, but we didn't stay. They seemed to be too expensive to be worth sticking around for. Hopefully this place improves is value, otherwise I doubt they'll make it through the next year."}
{"text":"Fun place for dates or outings with friends. If you are looking for a place other than bars to hang out at after dinner, the Rec Room is perfect. Not a lot of options for food, but the pizza's all right. Plenty of games, and bar seats for those watching sports."}
{"text":"We decided to check out the new popular hang out in Calgary \"The Rec Room\" spacious and lots of VR gaming and Food. We sat upstairs in the restaurant nestled next to a ping pong table. I ordered their Blueberry Mimosa, Buttermilk Biscuits with Vanilla Honey Butter & Strawberry Jam, Smoked Meat Deviled Eggs and Wood Grilled Asparagus served with a soft boiled egg and béarnaise, The Hot Smoked Salmon Benedict -  two poached eggs, in-house smoked salmon, grilled portobello mushroom caps, fennel, spinach, napa slaw, béarnaise sauce. The Skillet Mac + Cheese - caramelized onions, smoked cheddar, marble, fontina, herbed breadcrumbs & she added parmigiano charred broccoli & sun-soaked tomatoes. The Devil Eggs were not great, smoked meat was lacking, which was disappointing. The biscuits was ok the vanilla honey butter was not great it was pasty, biscuits was not warm so the butter did nothing for it. Grilled Asparagus was served in a cast iron pan (thinking its gonna be hot) it was cool. My Hot Salmon Benedict was also disappointing. The in house smoked salmon was like picked through and the serving of the salmon was very little. All placed on a mushroom cap instead of a english muffin. The lack of Salmon had a nice smoke to it, but i felt the Benedict was so over whelmed by the thick Mushroom Cap and the Napa Slaw and fennel it just took away from the very small salmon portion and the egg. My partners Mac and Cheese was not flavour full nor was it creamy, it was dry through out. Over all we were extremely disappointed with their food all food was served room temperature. Nothing was hot. The dishes lacked flavour and i am so sure that some of these dishes were made in advance. The place was not busy so, the kitchen should be able to keep up. Even though they did forget my main course. They rushed it and it was not even hot. Overall the service was friendly our server was apologetic & comped my entree. #calgaryfoodie #calgarydining #yycrestaurant #yycdining #foodlovers #foodporn #food"}
{"text":"Fun place to hang out with friends! I wish they had more games tho. It was kinda focused on bars than games. They sell soda for $4 :0!! Pretty pricy for just a cup of soda.."}
{"text":"This place is pretty fun!! Dave and Busters Canada version. Today it's their third day since opening. I came yesterday. A staff gave me a tour. Excellent service! But I didn't get to play. Came back again with my kids today. Another staff Ian gave us more information on this place and showed me to the phone charging station. Excellent professional service!! You can also come here for dining, drinking, playing at the arcade all in one place. They have good looking healthy food on the screen/menu and some bar foods. Game is for all ages from the violent shooting games for adults to pec man and candy crush for kids. Pretty fun for a family night. My family plays a lot of outdoor sports but once in a blue moon when on vacation, we let the kids play video games (not at home) but with them in an arcade like this. It's alternative family time;) and this place is pretty modern and fun!"}
{"text":"bar service was slow. it took awhile for one of the servers to take our order, and even then she was a bit awkward. i asked her how to pronounce one of their whiskey and she says \"it doesn't matter\". my partner tried to cheer her up by complimenting her earrings, and only then did she give a bit of personality.  we then played some games and spent a good chunk of money as they had some good machines on deck. online hours says it'll close at 1am, but at around 12:30 everything just shuts off. we are not locals and so we did not know what to do with the rest of the money on the card. i walked away with starbursts and razzle dazzles and an attitude, because at the end of the night the coat check person left a couple of coats on display on the counter jokingly saying \"come get them, they're free\" while his buddy was laughing at us. we felt humiliated and rushed. if we had known they were closing early, we would not have been dragging our foot to leave.   the coat check also asked for my phone number and i kept getting annoying texts afterwards to come back to visit the place. it was such an annoying night for a place that has a lot of potential. the woman at the prize counter was great, and one of the other servers were great. but everyone else seemed like they either did not like their jobs or got a kick out of teasing their patrons.   play with caution."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a date night! It's basically an arcade made for adults and the best part is that kids are kicked out after 10 pm!! Walk around with good cocktails and have your pick of a ton of different games, but be prepared to wait a little while for most of them. Some will always have a line, like the shooting, Mario cart, and Jurassic Park games, but it's not usually excessive and people and pretty good about moving on after their turn. The redemption center is packed with jerseys, MK purses and such for the happy adult! We've ate at the restaurant as well, which they try really hard to make fancy (classic honey garlic flavor is called something exceedingly long), overall food was good but it does take a long time to get out to your table."}
{"text":"Was kind of disappointed with this place. Saw pictures of the rec room before coming, but when I got there it was a lot smaller than expected! The dining/bar area was a lot bigger than the arcade area too, but the food is pretty expensive. The good  thing though is you can earn scene points with your scene card if you purchase credits. Overall, I think places like Dave and busters is more worth it to go to if you want more selection on arcade games!"}
{"text":"If you haven't heard anything about this place yet, you're about to. It like an adult playdium or a modern dave and busters thats catered for torontonians. A hybrid bar/restaurant/arcade, that does all quite well.   We decided to eat here, and took a spot on the patio, even though there is a shorter menu for the patio. We got the burger and half dozen wings, and both were pretty good for its price. The wings were very well done; nice and crispy, with a ton of meat. We got the chipotle bbq sauce, which was one of the best sauces i've had with wings. The burger was fresh and tasty, but lacked any sort of uniqur character. Both amounted to $30, which was reasonable in my opinion. The service was excellent, and you even get free popcorn with your meal!  The arcade also was very well done. You get a slight discount on credits with your meal, which we took advantage of ($5 for 40 credits). Games were 4-6 credits each, with certain games going well above if they were more extravagant. The thing that impressed the most was the prize selection. They had many prizes catered to adults (i.e mugs bottle openers, notepads, socks etc) instesd of a bunch of useless toys.    The only criticism I had was that some staff were not well knowledged, the prize centre didnt have bags and there were too  much floor staff in the arcade. They had many kinks to work out still for such a new place, but i look forward to returning and trying the many for features they have!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday where it happened to be on the same day as a Blue Jays game in the evening and it was insanely crowded. The games area is not spaced out well as it feels like you are walking through a crowded supermarket. The entire time people were accidentally bumping into you while walking by or while standing and waiting for a game. The only relief was when we went to the very back where the sofas are and just relaxed there. Also, it took 5mins to get a barista's attention for water, perhaps they should leave a glass cooler of water so that we don't have to ask for it."}
{"text":"The place was busy but fast. The ribs were perfect as was the pork chop. However the calamari was disappointing as it seemed lime it was batter with sauce.  Will come here again to try the the steak."}
{"text":"I like it. Was there to celebrate my birthday and wanted a place that offered more than just dinner. The rec room did that by providing great ambiance, a unique setting, arcade games, and friendly staff....along with a great dinner. The menu offers a variety of which I consider Canadian standard fare (eg: pizza, burgers, steak, fish, poutine, salads, fish, apps, etc), and our food was delicious. The location is easy to get to by transit or driving and garage parking is steps away. I'm looking forward to going back maybe on a day when it's not so busy, although busy is good (really good)!"}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Saturday night in October for a birthday. It was crazy packed at 8pm but no lineup to get in, as this does happen later on. The wait to get a table was impossible, and the gaming area was insane. I didn't like the layout of where the gaming area and bar was, as it felt too claustrophobic. I was sad I couldn't play any games, as I loveeee to do that. The drinks were really good, especially the rec room mule, made with whiskey. They had enough bartenders to cater to the crowd, which was hectic due to the argos, raps, and leafs all playing that day. We found a back room, which had a lounge type feel. We were able to get couches and food. The pizza and buffalo chicken were absolutely delicious. I love ricotta on my pizza! The prices were pretty reasonable. They also gave free popcorn at the bar. I'd definitely come back, but maybe not on a busy sports night."}
{"text":"Great place for chilling with friends and casual dining I love the large space & decor Very appropriate for large parties   Server/ Host knowledge: 4 Server/host attitude: 4.5 Fast service: 4 Food Menu: 4 Drinks Menu: 4 Food quality: 4 Food Portion: 4 Ambience: 4.5 Distance to other tables: 4.5 Cleanliness: 4.5 Comfort: 4.5 Waiting time to get seated: 5 Price: 4"}
{"text":"So I went for food and not for games. I was crunched for time and had an impromptu sister date here. Parking is not ideal  I suggest you take public transporation ,  a cab or Uber to get there as its directly across from the Rogers Centre and parking  is steep in that area. The ambience as soon I steped in was welcoming and inviting. I felt like I was at an upscale Dave and Busters with wayyyyy better food and service. I will definitely be back to play games and more food"}
{"text":"Great fried chicken, good service, fun games.   So I decided to organize a Valentine's Day event and wanted something that wasn't just a sit down venue. I got there and didn't realize how big the arcade was - it's got a huge selection of games and you buy credits to play them. There's a bar and restaurant too so it's a pretty cool venue. It would be a cute first date or a good birthday venue. I highly recommend the brined fried chicken although I also loved the asparagus starter. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"In terms of food and service, this place is a NO GO!  the service is super slow and the food is subpar at best.   Please save yourself and DO NOT GO HERE."}
{"text":"To sum up my experience, I wasn't satisfied with my food and was scolded by my server for 'not complaining earlier.'   All around disappointing food, service, and lack of games.   Let me elaborate... 1. Do NOT order the Rotisserie Chicken BLT. It comes complete with Ready Chrisp bacon, bland, dry, warmish chicken, and a thick soft bread to make you feel like you're getting bulk with your order. Honestly, the bread was the best part about this sandwich. Other friends also not impressed with their dishes.  2. Not many games in the arcade area. 3. Really slow service (can't tell if it's bad staff or bad management)   I used to bartend and wait tables, so I know it can be frustrating when your understaffed and trying to keep up. I can also appreciate the natural speed bumps that come with a new restaurant fine tuning their operations. I really tried to give our server (and restaurant) the benefit of the doubt.   I ate my sandwich anyway (big mistake) due to pure hunger, and asked our waitress to pass a message to the kitchen in hopes that they can avoid making this sandwich as horrible for the next victim. She responded by asking me, \"Well why didn't you tell me earlier?\" So I kindly let her know that no one had asked (servers are supposed to ask \"how's everything?\" within 2-3 minutes of receiving your plate), and that I was too hungry to wait for a replacement dish. She then says, \"But I came around and took your drink order.\" I was a bit stunned to be honest. She was quite defensive, but I had simply asked for a message to go to the kitchen; I hadn't asked for a refund, and I hadn't asked for another meal. After a brief conversation with our waitress and no apology, I gave up and let her continue with her evening.  So not only was my 17 dollar sandwich terrible, but I was scolded for 'not comaining earlier.'  Please don't go here. They don't deserve your business, and you don't deserve them either."}
{"text":"The experience my group and I had here was so bad, it was nearly comical. We arrived at 5:40pm for dinner, and upon asking to be seated next to a TV showing soccer, were instead seated in front of the giant screen playing the Flames. We placed an order for appetizers (popcorn chicken and asparagus). This was the last time we saw our waiter. The popcorn chicken was brought out by another waitress 40 minutes later, and we finally received the asparagus 30 minutes after that, after asking multiple different waiters/waitresses who came by our table where it was. A waitress finally took our order for dinner at 6:50pm - over an hour since we had been seated, and it was blatantly clear that she did not know the menu. Meanwhile, one person in our group, who had ordered a lemonade at the start of our meal, finally received it, which, again, was brought by an entirely different waiter. We must have had 4 or 5 different waiters/waitresses coming to our table, none of which had any clue what was going on. The food finally came out (3 salmons and 1 portobello mushroom), and it was subpar at best, especially considering the price. As a waiter was clearing our dishes, he dropped the dirty silverware onto someone in our party, and honestly, it seemed perfectly fitting. Needless to say, we will absolutely not be back."}
{"text":"Loved the idea of this. I made a reservation online for two because I thought it would be busy if I just did a walk in, good thing I did because there was a Blue Jays game and it was pretty crowded. The interior is beautiful, but I think they should have made more space for the arcade. I get that it's entertainment and eating but let's face it, people are coming for the arcades since playdium and DB are far.   My boyfriend and I decided to eat first and then play. Food was okay, I had the Three10 burger and fried calamari. You can barely taste the calamari but they had good dipping sauce. Our server was really nice, and professional. As we were eating we noticed that there was another back eating area of the restaurant, which was quite isolated (maybe for certain groups or games?). Also, there were huge groups of employees just standing around either laughing or constantly yawning. Either way really unprofessional.   After we ate we played at the arcade, they had some really cool games (4 player air hockey, race stimulator,..) But they also had a very small selection. As the day went by it was getting really crowded. However, I still had fun and decided to leave before the gaming area got an overwhelming amount of people.   If there were somethings I'd change they would be to expand the arcade area because waiting is a lot longer than it should be, and that back area of the restaurant honestly is not needed. And to also make sure adults aren't bringing their beer when there's children around them. It looks kinda sketch when four grown men are drinking beer racing each other and a mother is next to them with her kids waiting to go next."}
{"text":"Avoid this place after a game or on weekend nights..pretty much impossible to find a game to place as there are lines for everything. I like the concept of this place and the prices for the games seem fair but the game area was smaller than I thought and a lot of the games were out of service. The food wasn't bad but it of course was overpriced. It's a cool place to visit once or twice but I'm not dying to return here."}
{"text":"Went in to buy a gift card for Christmas and went straight to The Pumps to get an injected donut. I picked the depth charge and got vanilla custard injected into it... It didn't taste any better than a Boston Creme from Tim Hortons. I'll try the restaurant next time."}
{"text":"Was really excited to eat at The Rec Room while visiting Toronto today. We were greeted by a chill host who seated us immediately. However the waitress left much to be desired. We were not visited immediately. The drinks took about 45 minutes to come out and my salad took about two hours to come out. The food was cold when it came out, and my gluten allergy was not taken into consideration."}
{"text":"As a place to get some games in as well as a restaurant, you've got the whole package. There are, arguably, better arcades in the GTA but if you're looking for something downtown, you probably won't have many options.  Food generally goes for around $20 for an entree. The portion is pretty good, but flavor wise I found it pretty average. If you order an entree, you get $5 off the $10 card! That gets you 40 credits to use at the arcade.  Games range from 3 to 8 credits, with most games going for 4 credits. Most games reward tickets that you can use to redeem at the prize room. Many games have a jackpot of 500 tickets, but unless you're really good, you probably won't get them.   The game selection is not too big, but there's a good variety to cater to different skill sets. I particularly enjoyed a kungfu panda game where you physically smash gongs.   There are many different prizes to choose from, from candies to plushies to board games, gadgets, and office merchandise. You'll need around 500 tickets for the plushies, while higher end items are 4000+. Tickets can be pooled together if you really want to go home with something big, or you can redeem them next time.  Overall, it gets its job done as an arcade. They have an immersive VR experience, but I haven't tried that yet."}
{"text":"This is great upscale place to hang out on a weekday or weekend. There's a lot of activities pool, ping pong, board games, arcade games, large screens to watch matches, VR (haven't tried that yet, it's an additional cost) and of course food/bar. It's good for group hangout. Lots of space to sit and enjoy. Can't cover everything in one day so makes it great for coming back. The food is a bit pricey but that's a given for such a space. The arcade games are based on tokens which you can top up via a bracelet. For $10 you can play quite a few games so that's good."}
{"text":"This place is great if you want to game and dance and drink and eat all at once! It's definitely a great hangout session for a diverse group of friends. Brace yourselves though, it gets PACKED in the evenings.   The games are very fun, very arcade like. Some easier then others, I would say Dave and Buster's has a larger selection and is bigger game wise.  The dance floor was an interesting experience. We did run into some trouble at one point with some drunkards bothering my female friends, but security was thankfully quick to act. The floor is pretty small compared to a normal club, but alot of people don't come to dance anyways, so it was good and roomy.  The food here is honestly some of the best comfort food in the city. It definitely hits the spot in between all the drinking, dancing and gaming you do. They have a variety of unique options from poutine to pizza.  The menu is pretty diverse. I saw a good amount of vegetarian and vegan options. The prices are pretty high, most things being $20+ and the wait time is ridiculous. We were a group of 6, and got there around 7 and yet had to wait almost 2 hours for a table.  The Little Italy pizza is honestly the best compromise between comfort and gourmet! It's thin crusts is easy to chew and has just the perfect amount of cheese and seasoning that bring out all the Italian flavours. It's easy to chew and definitely delicious.   Their fries from the poutine is SO GOOD. It's so crunchy and yet soft in the places it needs to be."}
{"text":"Three10: It was my friend's birthday and she chose to celebrate it here! We were seated at our reservation time around 5 (75% of your reserved party must be present for you to be seated) and ordered. I got the Three10 burger and a side of fries. The burger tasted just like a whopper and the fries, lightly salted, weren't as crispy as I had wanted it. But it did fill me up but other restaurant equivalents like Moxie's, in comparison, taste better with a larger portion at the same price. In addition, when you dine in, you can get the Rec Pass (originally $10) for $5 and it has 40 credits.  Arcade: There was a diverse range of customers and different age groups too. The arcade got busier near the night time and the most fun games had a line up. It became noisy with lots of people holding drinks and having fun. The atmosphere was good and there were some staff walking around and checking up on people. For 40 credits and the way the games are set up to minimize the chance of you actually winning a lot of tickets, I got ~150 credits meaning 1 and a 1/2 pencils. I would recommend the Rec Room if you enjoy playing arcade games, not to win good prizes."}
{"text":"The games are a giant version of your iPhone games (candy crush etc.). Expect lineups for Mario kart, motorcycle racing, walking dead and basketball. There are some ticket games. I think the ticket value is really good for getting prizes. This is a place to kill a bit of time before going to one of the nearby tourist attractions. No way can you spend hours here like in playdium or Dave and busters because there's not too many games and it's quite expensive. There's also a long wait to purchase the wristband and to check your points. There should be more counters for that. I like that there's a giant screen to watch games, and there's a restaurant, bar and pool area. The racing simulation thing is really cool but very difficult to manoeuvre. Watch others before using your points because it's really pricey. I wish they had more shooting games like time crises or walking dead and fighting games like tekken or street fighter. Again, most games you can download and play on your iPhone."}
{"text":"Had a great time with cousins for Family Day! The place isn't that big, so it got kind of crowded; prepare to sweat if you visit in the winter with your big coat (I believe there was a coat check though)! Food was great and an awesome selection of arcade games. The prices for game credits were also good. The atmosphere overall was lively and you get to forget your adult life for a few hours."}
{"text":"I came in a few times shortly after they opened, and it wasn't too busy. The third time I tried, it was closed for a private event and a fourth time, the lines were crazy long and I decided it wasn't worth the wait. It's nice to see the space reinvented (as it used to be a furniture shop) and there are plenty of games to choose from. The whole vibe is pretty corporate, but the place was clean and well-lit, the games are new, and the bathrooms are maintained. These guys probably get a lot of foot traffic from all the tourist attractions nearby. What's the opposite of Kensington Market? This."}
{"text":"Great place to hang around after work and team outing. However, the cost of the game is too pricy and too short. $24 per person for trying out the VR game in less than 15 mins."}
{"text":"Came here today with a group of five people around 1 pm. I recalled watching a video on facebook about The Rec Room, which got me really excited because I love arcades. Anyways, upon entering, you are asked whether you are here for either the games or to eat. My friends and I decided to buy our credits first. The prices weren't too bad compared to other places. I bought the 80 credits which cost $15. For an additional $5, you can upgrade to a nicer wrist band. The regular wristband has a silver part that connects the entire wrist band and can easily come off (happened with two of my friends).   The venue is huge and very clean however; I certainly was not impressed by the amount of games there were. I believe playdium and dave & busters  has more games than The Rec. By the end of it all, I ended up with 375 points. The gift shop was relatively small and the prizes were so expensive! A bag of pop rocks costed 150 points, which is insanely ridiculous. Also compared to most places, there is usually candy which is 5 points, but NAH YOU AIN'T FINDING ANY OF THAT HERE! The lowest amount of points is 20 for a foam cube and above that is 60.   I'm sorry, but there's no hype. The only fascinating part was swiping your credits with your wristband."}
{"text":"Attended a catered event here. The food was excellent as was the service. The catered menu included a salad, entrée and dessert. We were so full afterwards. I had Caesar salad, Rotisserie chicken (with an amazing gravy that I ran out of way too fast, garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus), and Bumbleberry crisp. All were delicious. My husband had a chocolate cream pie (in a mason jar) short rich and sweet, definitely for chocolate lovers, but really rich on the back end of such a large dinner. The rec room also makes some cool cocktails like the glamour (great for malibu lovers) and the strawberry basil lemonade. Nice wine and beer list too. They also have a walk up bar that includes in house made doughnuts, but we are so full we couldn't try one even if we wanted.  The entertainment factor here is great! Love the video games, especially the giant space invaders and Pacman. I really wanted to try the transformers game, but it was busy, and they were pretty into it. I would highly recommend for a fun night out with friends, bachelor / bachelorette party or corporate events. We had a great night!"}
{"text":"This place has a lot more hype than it deserves. It's a fun place with lots of games and different things to do, but if you're planning on staying a long time there's no point. You finish all of the arcade games within 30 minutes to an hour, and then after that there's not really anything else to do. You barely get enough points to get any of the good prizes, so you might as well just buy them.   The price is fair, you pay 30 dollars for a lot of points on a card that lets you play at least twice for all of the machines.   All in all a good experience, but nothing different from going to the arcades at a movie theatre or the one in Cross Iron. At least at Cross Iron Mills the prizes are achievable."}
{"text":"Came here for the very first time on a Thursday evening afterwork at around 7pm with my cousins. Not much luck with finding free parking in the area, so we ended up parking in the Metro Toronto Convention Centre (South Building) parking lot. The entrance to the parking lot is on Lower Simcoe St. To get to The Rec Room there's an exit that takes you directly to Bremner Boulevard which is about a 1 minute walk to the door of The Rec Room.   Walked in to be greeted by 2 separate reception areas. The first one was for purchasing your credits to play in the arcade and the second one was for the dining area (I think). You can use your Scene points or pay to purchase credits used to play the games. These credits are loaded onto a small keycard that gives you access to the machines. 1000 Scene points can get you $10 worth of credits. Each game in the arcade charges a different number of credits for you to play.   My visit to The Rec Room was solely to play at the arcade so I won't be commenting on the food and drinks. There are 2 restaurants located within this facility, a bar with big screens for sports fans to enjoy a drink while cheering for their favourite sports teams, and the arcade area which is accessible to all. My first impressions of this place after walking in was that it was hectic and a bit disorganized. Although the dining areas were sectioned off, all you can see were people walking around with drinks in their hands, people watching people play, or people lining up to play. For an arcade, I wouldn't say they had a huge selection of games to play, but there were obviously some more popular ones than others like shooting hoops, Mario Kart and air hockey. The line ups to play these games will eventually discourage people from wanting to  play. If you have younger children, I don't think this place is suitable for them as it's not very kid friendly. The idea of being allowed to drink while gaming sounds exciting and fun, but in reality, it's just stupid. There's enough people walking and standing around as it is, we don't need drinks to be spilled too.   Don't think I'd be returning to play games, but I'll probably give the food a try."}
{"text":"Great addition to the downtown core. This place is like a downtown version of D&B except some games are newer and the prizes you exchange with the tickets are more catered to adults, ranging from wine openers to MK and coach wallets. While the stuffed animals are available to be won with the tickets that you win during the game.   There's also a section there is full VR experience where they only have this in location, such NY and a few other locations. That section is $25, currently the ghost buster theme is on.  There is also a restaurant and beer available, great spot while waiting for a game or after a game or gathering with friends!"}
{"text":"Excellent service- thank you kaitlynn, you went above and beyond! The food was so delicious, drinks were yummy and atmosphere is awesome! Loved the games!  Will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Large venue with separate areas for food, bar, games and shuffleboard. I came here on a Thursday and Friday night, and it gets significantly busier on the Friday night. The layout of the games area does not allow for much movement during crazier times (like Friday night), but when less crowded it was very easy to find our way around."}
{"text":"My cousins from Australia were in town and we were trying to come up with something fun to spend the evening doing. Then I remembered that The Rec Room had opened recently and thought it might be a fun night out.   We each bought 30 dollars worth of \"tokens\" (which are added to a digital bracelet so you're not actually lugging any physical tokens around, how times have changed!) and were told that it would probably last us about two hours. Spoiler alert: it did. In fact, I was trying to find ways to use up my tokens by the end (the Photo Booth was a good way to use them up).   Which brings me to one of the bigger downsides: the lack of variety. Yes, it was super fun to get to play the arcade games, but the fact is there really aren't *that* many to choose from, and after the first hour you're kind of grasping for ways to kill tokens.  The types of games are basically split into two categories: skill games that give you \"tickets\" that you can redeem for prizes (think Ski-Ball, Hoops shooting, etc.) and pure arcade games that do not result in tickets (your Alien shooters, your racing games, etc.). There's also a \"third\" tier which are the \"jackpot\" type \"games\" which are really nothing more than you feeding tokens in hope that you hit the jackpot and win a bunch of tickets. It *can* be done - my one cousin ended up scoring almost 500 on one \"spin the wheel\" game - but chances are you're just going to burn a bunch of tokens real quick.   In other words, with most games costing between 6-8 tokens you could be hard pressed to actually spend them all and not get tired of playing the same few games over and over again.   There's also some pinball machines (including a beautiful Ghostbusters themed one) and in the back traditional bar games (like pool, though we didn't try these out). There's also a VR experience called \"THE VOID\" which costs ~$30 extra and requires a reservation but we didn't try it out. It looked cool, but I can't imagine it's worth the huge added cost. To be honest, the place is so huge there might have been more stuff we were missing, but it seemed that the arcade games were in one main, rather smallish section.  While $30/person isn't the most expensive night out, things could definitely be improved by adding a larger variety of games, and more of them. But in terms of a fun night out with out-of-towners, it was a big success.  They also have a restaurant called three10 which we had dinner at before digging into the games. It offers your standard sort of \"bar & grill\" fare (think burgers, steaks, wraps, etc). The food itself isn't great, and you're definitely paying a premium. For three people (including drinks) our bill was over $100 and you can easily get a *much* better meal for less in the city, so you're better to stick to just the games here, and avoid the food. Though the Popcorn appetizer (this is a Cineplex owned joint after all) was a nice touch!"}
{"text":"This place is so fun! Perfect for going out with friends and playing some arcade games. A lot better than Dave & Busters or Playdium in my opinion. It's located in a great spot too - easy to get to right by the CN Tower, Rogers Centre and Ripley's Aquarium.  Although it does get busy (especially on weekends), I've never had to wait more than a couple minutes to play a game, which I'd say is pretty good. The games are all packed really close together, so it can get a little crowded, but that adds to the fun. It's also not too expensive for game tokens. Depending on how long you want to stay and how many games you want to play, it probably makes more sense to put all your money together and load up the tokens on one bracelet, instead of each person getting their own.   Besides the arcade games, they have a bunch of TVs by the bar showing all the sports games, and a pretty decent bar area too. I've never had the food here - it's a bit overpriced, so I'll usually eat somewhere else and then just come for the games. The free coat check at the front is also extremely useful!  Also it's really hard to collect points from the games to redeem for prizes (good ones at least), but I guess that's like any arcade place. Just come for the games and it's a good time!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday evening and I am dissatisfied. I really wanted to love this place because I am a huge fan of arcades and really Dave N Busters is the only option, but it is far from downtown Toronto.   There is not a large selection of games and it is crowded so be prepared to have 2-3 people in front of you for each game. Despite it being crowded the games were not spaced out well causing it to feel like you are trying to walk through people within the TTC during rush hour.   The prizes are seriously lame, but that is usually for all arcades. I would suggest taking the trip to Dave N Busters as it a A LOT larger and there is a broader selection of games.   Pros: The Lemonade drink and their wristbands."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday with a group of friends on a Friday night. The food was okay... pretty expensive. You need to reserve WAY ahead of time if you're planning to come here on a Friday night or Saturday night. The service wasn't good.. it was slow. No need to reserve the Arcade though but it's super busy on a Friday night. Sometimes you will have to line up to play some games. I heard the pool tables have a waiting list/first come, first serve. The prizes that you can get by collecting points are better than Dave and Busters'. I would come back here on a less busy day."}
{"text":"Over priced and over hyped.. just no no no. Did I mention no?  I came Here for a friends birthday outing and it was for dinner and games. I was super excited as I like the whole concept of video games and tokens and all that childhood nostalgia feelings. The video game selection is on the low side compared to other places. Not to mention you spend more time in the lines for the video games than the actual duration of the games. A 20 minute wait just to play some hoops? I get it's a prime time spot in downtown but seriously? Not to mention a few games were busted, we were jipped of some credits by a few games that ate our tokens (they ate more than me.. more on that later). It was extremely crowded and we constantly overheard people talking about the lines. On top of that, more people were coming In! So beware personal space is not a thing here haha  Ok now for the cherry on top. The food! It was not good at all. I ordered the skillet Mac n cheese- HUGE mistake! Don't even get me on my extra charge for Caesar salad as my side. No offence, it can't be a Caesar salad without the Caesar! There was no dressing on the salad at all! When I finally was able to find our server, she was so not helpful. I told her about my salad and the fact I didn't like the Mac n cheese. She asked what I didn't like about it and I explained it tasted like I was just licking the skillet. Metal is all I tasted. So after all this she took it away and I didn't hear anything. There was no offer to maybe get something else or someone to talk to. Heck I was so hungry I would of taken just fries! The real kicker? I was still charged for the whole meal! I paid over 35 dollars for food I didn't even eat. When talking to the server she was like I don't know that's all head office stuff and walked away. Yeah that earns you 1 star and only because I have to give 1 star on yelp."}
{"text":"Great place to go.  Went there for a work function.  I have been to similar places that have so many kids you can't even walk around, but this was a good experience.  I really enjoyed playing ping pong.....I've never seen ping pong tables at dave and busters or any similar establishment.  I can't speak to the food, but everyone had a good time and it was a good variety of games too."}
{"text":"Our experience at the Rec Room was lacklustre. We came in around 7:30 and asked for a table, and we were told it would take about 45 minutes to have the table ready. We went back an hour later and were told it would take 15 minutes since they were cleaning. When we went back after the 15 minutes, we were told it would take 20 more minutes because they were STILL cleaning the tables.   There seemed to be plenty available tables, but none of them were being cleaned, as it appeared there was more security guards at the Rec Room rather than servers waiting and cleaning up tables. Around 9:00pm we decided that we would leave, but as soon as we were about to cancel we were finally seated. Personally, I feel that my party and I were not seated fast enough due to not being taken seriously, as we were a bit younger than the others at this establishment.  Once we were seated, there were still a lot of empty tables but they were left dirty. One table near us was dirty for the majority of our dinner until it was somewhat cleaned.  The redeeming quality was that it didn't take too long to get our food after waiting over an hour and a half for our table. The pizza and burgers were average at best. The wristbands for the games were very efficient and there were some really fun games, but the selection was a bit limited.  In all, I don't plan on returning, and would much rather go to Dave and Busters for a better experience."}
{"text":"We went there as a group. The ambiance was good and the interior is very modern. I wasn't very impressed by the service. Our guy server thought it was very confusing for him to deal with a big group with separate bills. For a place like this, having big groups paying separately shouldnt be something new. They should already have a system for situations like this. He was worried about giving the food to the wrong person. But we know what we ordered so all they had to do is bring the food, announce the dish to the groups and give it to whoever claims for it. Though he did get every order and bill right in the end. I liked our lady server. She comes by updating us when our order will come. Our orders took forever to arrive though but they arrive all at the same time. I asked if it's a busy night for them and he said yes but he said usually on a Friday and Saturday. It's Thursday today. How long has this been opened anyway? Big place = more people = lots of orders! The food wasnt that great as well. The porkchops were dry, bland, and tough! The bison lasagna tasted something that's made from home-which means nothing special. The calmares and pizza wasn't tasty. To compensate for the delayed food, they gave us wristbands that's has $20 credits to us in the arcade area.   I like the vibe and the the modern design but I'd prob won't come back here anymore."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but the service is incredibly slow. I get that they just opened and they are probably still trying to work out the kinks but seriously when your food comes before you get your drink (food took over 45 mins btw) there is some serious issue with the whole process. I am sure they are aware of these issues and are trying to fix it which may take a little time. One suggestion/observation is maybe hire a little less security and more bartenders... Just a thought since there was like 50 security guards roaming the place which I thought was odd for an arcade. The games are cool and since I live in the area it will be a fun place to hangout towards the end of the night. Not sure if I would come back for food again... Burger was very average and the wings were nothing special and expensive ($16 for a half dozen). The staff were friendly and apologetic for the slow waits. I will come back in hopes things turn around. Playing the games is fun. One more suggestion... How come you don't have Heineken?? Not even in a bottles which is shocking. You would have so much more of my business if you stocked that beer. Just ask St Louis Bar & Grill down the street and they will tell you how much they go through in a single week from my business alone."}
{"text":"Three10 burger - my burger was so over cooked, I could of sworn I was eating cardboard.   I enjoyed the French fries, but was seriously disappointed with their burger. (Again..)   1.5oz Crown Royal - $9 6 shots - $61 and change..   So they have street fighter now. (Big deal)"}
{"text":"This place sounds great in theory, but in practice it's a gong show. The establishment has all the components needed for a fun night out, but things are either awkward or inefficient resulting in a mediocre experience. I liked the convenience of the wristbands, but that's about the only positive thing I can say about the place. They had a decent amount of games, but more than half of them were gambling type games to gain credits that you can redeem for prizes at the end - these weren't fun in the slightest bit. The \"fun\" games were fewer in number so there was usually a line for them, which was irritating considering the illogical design and lack of space in that building. On top of that, no matter how well you did in the fun game, the payout was usually low which could be off putting for some. Their food selection was pretty standard, but there really was nowhere to eat other than the bars, since we were informed that there was a three hour wait for a table....yeah, you read that right. Honestly, what is the point of having a restaurant on site if it is that inefficient and poorly run? I ended up having one of their poutine's and it was quite enjoyable, although a friend complained that it had \"too much meat.\" The staff is nice and it seems as though they are trying to do their best despite the lack of encouraging circumstances. Overall, I think this place is fun with a large group of friends, however if I was here with only one or two other people, these small issues would be much more irritating."}
{"text":"The food is surprisingly good here - especially the pizza. Their cocktails are also very tasty - their Moscow Mules are notable!"}
{"text":"Wow! What an energizing atmosphere! Great fries and burger. Love the smoked cheese optional topping. The Wings are fantastic, the fish and chips are amazing! I love the popcorn instead of bread idea. We went two days in a row for lunch. I would prefer that the onion soup be more traditional. I didn't care for the smoked brisket in the soup. Just messed with my mind! Someone else might just like it though.   The arcade was a hit with the kids. Loved the different cocktails."}
{"text":"Wanna get a high score in mom/dad points? Wanna earn that bonus round with a date? Get Rec't! As in, take them to The Rec Room! Occupying a sleek loft in a prime location, The Rec Room is the perfect way to kill a few hours. Sure, you have Dave & Busters which has a similar model, but there are some things that completely blow D&B out of the water.   - READY, START -   The first thing you notice, of course, are the flashing lights of the arcade. No, it's not the biggest, and they will definitely benefit from expanding this section. Around the corner, however, is the main attraction: VIRTUAL REALITY. It's an experience that's operated separately from the Rec Room, which means you pay an extra $25 but it's something you HAVE to try. VR is the future, and the one here is amazing! Spoiler alert, you bust ghosts.   - LEVEL UP -  When you're getting a little tuckered out with throwing balls, beating scores, and whacking buttons, there are 3 different areas you can recharge. There's a fast food area with your usual pizza and fries, an indoor bar/restaurant with reliable contemporary fare, and an outdoor patio. We chose the indoor restaurant and there were 2 things that stood out.   1) They have the BEST salmon burger I've ever tried. On top of that, they have a good range of bar options. We got a blackberry mint julep and grapefruit sangria, which were both tasty. Yes, I would consider coming back just for the restaurant portion.   2) The waitress taking our order paused and said to me, \"Sorry, I got distracted. You're so pretty!\" WHY THANK YOU! GUESS WHO'S GETTING A BIG TIP? :D  - FINAL ROUND -   Ok, I'm not gonna say I had the typical experience here. On that day, I was blessed by the game gods, who bestowed on me the coveted, unthinkable MEGA JACKPOT in one of those ball drop games. Yeah. I got like, 7000 tickets. In any other arcade, that might've gotten you something useless/irrelevant to your life, like a giant plushy or a crappy karaoke machine.   At the Rec Room, you get prizes you want. Well, that I want. Like Michael Kors, Kate Spade, and Coach. I also saw Swell bottles, shirts with actually cool designs, and a drone. The one time I walked into an arcade and walked out with a suitable return on investment in the form of a brand new Coach wristlet.   Gotta say, I had a great time here. This is a top choice to bring out-of-towners, or bored in-towners. Games were typical but staff were engaging, VR was phenomenal, and that burger was ughhhh.  Yep, I got Rec't. And I liked it.   (91/100) - 2017"}
{"text":"Came and checked this place out on a Friday night and it was packed! The interior is very nice as it has the warehouse big party room vibe. This is a great place to pre or come for drinks with friends. Only disappointment is that there weren't as many games as Dave and Busters, but the environment is definitely more lively. Paid around $40 in credits for 2 people and we stayed for 2 ish hours."}
{"text":"Like everyone said it's a downtown Dave and Busters with more people and a smaller space. In spite of that it's a decent joint to chill at when looking for bar food and games. Machines get glitchy sometimes but that's natural with abuse I suppose. Nice to experience at least once if you've never been."}
{"text":"The food is alright, the patio is nice with a great view but the service is SO SLOW. We got no water and it took a solid 45 minutes to get our bill because, after bringing our food, the waitress basically forgot about us. Womp womp."}
{"text":"Staff are friendly but may need more training. The Void Ghostbusters VR experience was amazing but they didn't check the fit and function of the visors at all. My 12 year old said she had to keep lifting the helmet up to see properly. Takeaway: Make sure you request help with fitting your VR helmet if you find yourself having to manually adjust frequently.   The VR experience was amazing. I'm that scared of heights but the building exterior scene was deathly frightening. I couldn't bring myself to walk on the platform on the outside of the (virtual) building for a full minute. Even when I flipped up the visor to see a safe floor right in front of me, when I flipped the visor down I was terrified again. Astounding!  This ain't no Google cardboard, folks. This is incredible kit. You must check this out- it's the future of entertainment, for sure."}
{"text":"I went here when they first opened and it wasn't too busy or crowded which I liked, but I came back yesterday and the arcade was just as busy and crowded as Rebel nightclub's dance floor lol.   Waited in lines for games where other people would cut and no moving space to get to other rows of games.   The worst part was the food from the caf. We got 2 slices of pizza that was $8.50 and it was tiny. I got the mushroom poutine and it was bland and cold, the cheese wasn't even melted. What made it worse is that there were tons of fruit flies in the food area which made me freak out. I ended up throwing 80% of my poutine away because of how unappetizing it was. There was half eaten doughnuts everywhere and I get why because the doughnuts were gross too.   Service was good and I liked the prices for the tokens but other than that everything else was not worth it."}
{"text":"The games are fun but do not...DO NOT...get food here. There is automatic 18% gratuity and the service is absolutely horrible. I have given 1 star for food and 1 star for the games. Dave and buster is much more enjoyable. Everyone stay away. Thank you."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this place, which is a shame because it has a lot of potential. The restaurant is really quite bad, slowest service I have ever encountered and the food was priced high for what was mediocre fare.  The arcade has a couple of decent games but again, nothing to write home about, the staff weren't that friendly and the atmosphere didn't entice me to spend time or more money there."}
{"text":"Extremely disorganized food service. Expect groups greater than 4 to have slow and incorrect orders processed. They need another month of training. Food is mediocre and better at the Cineplex vip theatre."}
{"text":"Came here strictly for food on a weekend afternoon, walked in and saw that it looked similar to D&B's which was a cool concept. Didn't get a chance to play anything but walked around to see what games they offered. If the restaurant was full the playing area would definitely be over crowded for the size. Thankfully, it was not busy so we were able to get seated right away.  Their food menu seems pretty good and different compared to other arcade restaurants we've been to. They also offer brunch which was nice too. I would definitely say they offer more food choices with a better range of ingredients.   We didn't order much - just a pizza and a small order of fries. The waiter brought over a bag of popcorn which was cute and different. It was the good popcorn too - movie theatre kind!  The pizza was very good not overly greasy and not too bland. The fries were the kind that I loved, thick cut fries.  Overall, a very good addition to add to the area of choices to eat before / after a baseball game. Prices seem fair - around $17 for the pizza good for 2 people. We'll come back if we need to grab a bite before a baseball game!"}
{"text":"I went to Rec Room a few times. The first time was after I received a bracelet at a summer festival giving me unlimited gameplay for 2 hours. Although the gameplay didn't include the reward ones with tickets for prizes, it was fun with the racer one including the VR racing car.  The second time I went was karaoke night where a live band played some hits for us to sing. Kudos to the band playing from 7 pm to 1 am with little or no break. Song selection can be found on the band's website.  I never had any bites but the drinks were average price. It is quite a big place and I can imagine that rent is expensive. Not sure if the concept will work based on the location to make enough money to cover all the costs."}
{"text":"I had been hearing that the Rec Room was crazy busy ever since they opened this fall. Not wanting to deal with the evening crowds, I made my first visit during the quieter weekend brunch time.  The brunch menu features deluxe versions of breakfast favourites including eggs benedict with smoked salmon on mushroom caps and a bacon sandwich using pea-meal bacon on a brioche bun. For my meal, I ordered the skillet breakfast: a skillet with a base of smashed potatoes topped with cheese curds, beef brisket, onions, beer cheese sauce and two eggs.   I'll admit I didn't read the menu very well and didn't realize the dish came with a cheese sauce in addition to the cheese curds. I found this made the dish a little too heavy. Some tomatoes or other vegetables would have helped brighten up the skillet. However, this was helped by one of the side dishes of arugula salad with vinaigrette. The other side was smashed potatoes which, while delicious, were redundant to the same potatoes included in the dish itself.  My table-mate ordered the \"Eggs in Purgatory\", which is also tried. I preferred this meal, which consisted of two eggs poached in a slightly spicy tomato sauce served with foccacia and the same arugula salad.  I don't usually do the whole \"cocktails with breakfast\" thing, but I did see that there were several breakfast cocktails on the menu. I did enjoy that a mini bag of popcorn is offered when you are seating, in lieu of the standard \"table bread\".  The Rec Room offers something for everyone: restaurant, full bar/hangout and games. After just having the food, I would return to taste the full menu."}
{"text":"3.5/5 This place is a mix of sports bar meets Dave and Buster's.  Came here on a date with the boyfriend on an afternoon weekend. The location is right across from the Rogers Centre on Bremner Blvd.  Before I even got into the venue, I had to dump out my full bottle of water because they didn't know what was in it. Wonder if this policy is in effect for all days of the week, or just whenever games are in session.   The ambiance of this place is really nice - there is livelihood from the games, people chatting and the bar. Prices are reasonable in terms of game play tokens. We paid ~$30 for 200 tickets figuring that we're both bound to come back with friends. In terms of games there was an assortment of the games you find at Dave and Busters. Each game costs anywhere from 4-8 tokens a game. A very good selection of screen games, air hockey type, and the sporty types (skeeball, basketball) and racing games.    Drinks & food are expensive so best eat and grab a beer elsewhere. You earn Scene points on your purchases as this is Cineplex-owned (yay!)"}
{"text":"I have been hearing mixed reviews from people for many months now. I have wanted to go to get my own opinion but the only issue was that this place is all the way on the other side of the city from where I live. I live in the deep south and it is in the deep north (past the airport). So I knew that when I went I had to be committed. That is why when my friends decided to have a joint birthday there- it was great!  When I walked in the first thing I noticed is that it reminded me of a casino in Las Vegas. You have option- you can sit and eat food in the restaurant, you can go to the stand up bar, they have a separate room called the \"garage\" for bigger groups that want a sit down meal and to stay with their friends that only has 4 big table sin it. There is a walk up \"fast food\" bar and there is also a restaurant where you can only get poutine, but about 6 different kinds of poutine such as to say if you want something to eat but can't get into the restaurant or something along those lines. The pricing I thought was very reasonable for tickets to play games. The tickets also last you a long time because generally at every game there is a line so to use 200 tickets- you think they will go fast but they don't. Especially when your with your friends. If you want to play an individual game it isn't bad but if you want to challenge people it will take longer to be able to get both of you on the same machine. They have games for everyone- riding games on motorcycles or cars, fake beer pong, piano playing games, sports games like basketball or football, brain memory memorization challenging games, piano playing games, fishing games with a rod and all, etc. The only upsetting part is the part about alcoholic beverages pricing. I got a cesar and expected it to be about $8 which is above average for a Cesar... it was $12!!! && it was the worst Cesar I have had in my life! It was so spicy when I asked for no spice and was full of chunks! It also came with a pickle, salami and egg on top but the egg was disgusting because it was like a \"picked egg\" it was extremely vinegary. I was so disappointed with the cesar. However, drafts are a decent price and they have Okanagon on tap which is an Apple Cidar that I was impressed with.  They have an upstairs which is awesome too. It has a bar, couches, stage and more tables and a big screen and lots of the free games like ping-pong and pool. I like that they offer free games for you to play while your waiting for the line to die down for other games.  Overall, good place! I hope it lasts!  I don't know if I will be going back here anytime soon but it is only because I live so far away but now I know what all the hype is about."}
{"text":"The REC Room is the newest indoor gaming facility near the Rogers Centre. It's basically a large gaming facility owned by Cineplex and very similar to Dave and Busters for adults.  They have a restaurant and full service bar inside along with various cool games. The drinks can be on the pricey side starting at $9 for a pint a beer. You can also watch sports as they have large TV screens. In addition, they have a nice decent patio outside. You buy credits at the front desk and they give you a wristband that has all your credits and keeps your tickets digitally to claim for prizes so its paperless and convenient. During the peak times, there tends to be lineups to get in especially after game or concert days because it's near Rogers Centre. I thorough enjoyed the Mario Kart and the Kung Fu Panda game a lot as those were my favorite games here. The only slight disappointment is that I was expecting there would be more games as there would be lines at some of the games and that shouldn't be. Overall, it's a great place for a nice social outing and a fun place to be as an adult."}
{"text":"Great lunch, great drinks, great fun. Love this place! Everything is fabulous except for the stuff your own donuts which are like hard lumps of stale dough. Spoke with manager after we threw $18 of doughnuts out and was only offered fresh ones if made available"}
{"text":"Enjoyable and lots of fun games.   The virtual reality game, The Void - Ghostbusters is a must-do if you like shooting ghosts in a virtual reality game. Lasts around 10 min.   If you'd like get win lots of tickets, Kung Fu Panda is a good one. If you have st least 3 people with quick reflexes then every game may gain you 500 tickets."}
{"text":"Extremely crowded for the accommodating space. I nearly got smoked in the head with an air hockey puck. Just having a hard time comprehending hundreds and hundreds of children running all about and adults walking about with large glass tumblers of alcohol?? It was so crammed in there, I witnessed an adult male bump a person and slop his beer all over a small kid?? Not cool. Not for me."}
{"text":"Lots of promise, and even more work to be done to make this place viable after the honeymoon phase is done. Service in the restaurant was brutal for the price ($$$) with lots of little screw ups and amateur staff. The space itself is built out way too much for restaurant and private events making the arcade area a bit of a nightmare, crammed up with a mix of business people, bridge and tunnellers and kids.   Also, final note, is VR really still this shitty? I thought it was 2017 already."}
{"text":"Attended a group price fixe function.   Food took a long time to come.   Entree showed up before the appetizer.   Mac and cheese was lukewarm, congealed and dried out.  Mixed greens salad tasted ok but was limp.  And there was only one kind of lettuce.     My tablemates had the burger and fries.  The meat patties looked like they had sat for a while, dry and very dark. Buns were fresh.  Fries also had sat a while, A bit stale tasting, and not hot.  My other friend that had the vegy wrap enjoyed it.   And the Bumbleberry Crumble was good.  However, based on my meal, I wouldn't have gotten to the dessert. I would have been out of there if it had not been a group function.    Easily one of the worst places I have eaten.  And for $36 bucks a person!    Avoid avoid avoid"}
{"text":"Perfect place for me to go with my 16-year-old to enjoy games and food. We ate st the huge bar while watching  a wall of sports on TV.  The pizza was thin artisan style. Excellent food and selection of drafts.  Games were in working order and had a VR room which was unique to try to slay the ghosts in a ghostbusters theme."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the Rec Room.  The food was prepared fresh, the service was prompt and the staff were very accommodating and had a friendly sense of humour.  Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a fun evening with family or friends."}
{"text":"Great option for families for kids to play and parents dine in the restaurant.  Video games and ping pong were on the hit list when my family and I were last here.  The kids enjoyed all the gaming options and were fully entertained- so I could say worth the cost of wristband and credits.  As for the restaurant, it is a little pricy for what you get food wise- I have been here twice now and have only eaten pizza - while the toppings were intriguing and actually tasty, and the crust not too thick, it is still a bit pricy compared to other thin crust pizza options in the city.  Unlimited popcorn is a nice touch when they remember to bring it.  The kids meals were a good price for all the food included, even a large delicious dessert donut.    Kind of a pricy afternoon of entertainment - but could be worth it once in a while, as there are fun food and entertainment options for both kids and parents.   Not sure if this deal is an introductory special, but when you sit down to eat at the restaurant, purchase the wristband and credits from your server where they are cheaper than buying them from the gaming side alone."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's Bday party. The Rec Room resembles a mix between Real Sports Bar and Dave & Busters.  This is a great venue if you're looking to grab some food and drinks and watch a sports game as they've got a lot of TV's along with the jumbo screen, much like Real Sports Bar. On the flip-side if you're looking to enjoy some arcade games, there's plenty of selections to bring the kid out of you.  In terms of large scale selection of games I feel D&B has more to offer.  Prizes require more points and the selection of prizes are not the best.  Prices for play seem to be on the pricier side, after all, when you're in downtown in a tourist spot it's no surprise. In terms of food they've got a good selection and their prices are 'somewhat' reasonable, again goes in'sync with the area.   Jen and I ordered their: **Mac and Cheese served with Arugula salad; seemed basic, and almost looked like craft dinner but with added cheese.  **Buffalo Popcorn chicken which were both decent, well made, however found the portion a bit small for the price you're paying, especially since it's more of a BAR atmosphere."}
{"text":"Dropped by last night for the first time and had a lot of fun! Played some games and had a few drinks and it was great. Had a different bartender help me out each time and they were all very friendly. The woman that was at the front reception was also very kind and patient with explaining how everything works to my date and I. The security that they have are also extremely kind and helpful, always have Great experiences with Sentinel Security staff. There was also a great DJ (DJ Wexel, check him out) playing a set in the back room after a comedy show which was quite funny. All in all, great time, thank you for the fun night out!"}
{"text":"After waiting and waiting and waiting in line, I purchased some game credits from the manager.  After ringing me through, she told me the computer had failed - that I would not be charged and that they couldn't sell me game credits at that time.  I left without playing any games, kind of annoyed that I had wasted my time. Later that week, I noticed that my credit card had been charged for the game credits that I hadn't received.  I called the Rec Room, I called Cineplex and spoke to three different employees - was completely given the run around over a period of three weeks.  Still have not been refunded despite my best efforts.  What a rip off!  Keep a close eye on your credit card statement and your game credits if you go to the Rec Room."}
{"text":"The description for The Rec Room is not entirely accurate. I think 'Bar', and any kind of food descriptor, should come before the arcade tag.  Though the interior is really well designed, the bar and seating area food the restaurant portion takes up most of the space. Then there's a corner packed to the gills with overpriced arcade machines, half of which do not work or are glitchy. I bought a wristband for an extra $5, and it did not work. When I went back to the girl at the front to ask her what was up with it, she was not able to help me at all. She literally just tapped it again and was like no it works and was just totally done with the conversation. TIP: I think the prize shop guys are a bit more knowledgeable about things than the girls selling credits at the front, ask them for help.  Honestly I expected more from this place after going to Dave and Busters, unfortunately it was a bit lackluster. They do have better prizes in the prize shop than D&B, even though they're grossly overpriced. They should actually expand the arcade section a bit if they really want to call themselves an arcade.   We did not have the food, but 5 oz. of wine and a coke cost us a bit over $20. So overpriced! Totally not worth it.  Rec Room is okay, would go back if we were in the area and extremely bored, but I don't think it is anywhere close to being worth a trek downtown to visit."}
{"text":"This place has Great pizza! And that's coming from a New Jersian.I know great pizza! Wow it's amazing! The buffalo popcorn is to die for! I recommend 100%. The Mac and Cheese is great and the games are all great!  Nothing is dated everything is brand new! The drinks are fairly priced not to cheap not to expensive. Great place to come with all your friends!  Came here with my girlfriend and we had an amazing time! Next time I come back to Toronto! I'll definitely come again!"}
{"text":"fun! So busy kinda lost interest because it was so busy, Will be back when it's not so popular and I don't have to wait in line"}
{"text":"Had a lot of fun when I came here! Some of the games are quite fun, but this place is way too expensive.  Take away at the games and the Rec Room is just another giant sports bar. Things like Super Mario Kart, shooting some baskets, and all the other activities are what make it enjoyable and separates it from the rest. And for $30 you can play quite a few games, but don't expect to get much in return (unless you're awesome and rack up a ton of points). The prizes you can exchange for are kinda cheap, and you would have to drop quite a bit of cash to \"win\" anything decent.  Drinks are pricey but they have a decent selection. Food was slightly disappointing. I got the veggie wrap with lacklustre salad (also too much money). I guess that's what I get for not choosing a burger or wings, which all looked great. Service was a bit spotty -- had to wait a lot, but at least they were pleasant.  I'd like to come back here, and I will -- because I still have points on my bracelet to exchange for a prize! It's a tourist attraction (right next to the Skydome) so you're going to spend a lot, but it's worth experiencing once or twice with some friends on a weekday after work."}
{"text":"Place is pretty cool, it is huge. Food was just ok but the atmosphere is good."}
{"text":"Some of the reviews of the food were pretty offputting but actually there's something you can order @310. The pizzas are huge party size for groups. Like when you think margherita you probably think of a tiny pizza. Not this one. See pics.  Tried these pizzas:  Margherita: had some massive basil leaves, if you like margherita I think this is a serviceable pizza but the sauce is just decent it doesn't have the same punch some other margherita I've had.  The bounty: the ricotta cheese was so good and creamy. I would bet this is the best pizza on the menu. Would order again. Decent amount of mushroom on it as well.  The beast: actually I don't really like arugula so I won't include this in the rating but I think if you do you would enjoy this pizza it was not bad but I'm not an arugula guy.  The games:  They have 4 way air hockey. It is pretty hype. Enjoyed the beer pong game. Jurassic park was fun. Also there's a really cool photo machine. They also have the usual basketball games and tons of games I've never seen before.  Overall it's pricy entertainment but it would be nice to chill here before or after a jays game or for a team excursion."}
{"text":"Came for a garage rock show in the live venue and sat at the bar while we waited for the headliner.    Nothing is more frustrating than an understaffed bar ... the bartenders were running around like crazy, the customers were waiting fifteen minutes to get a drink, and everyone was in a bad mood as a result.    Cheap ass ownership is totally uncool."}
{"text":"Went here today for a friend's birthday. Puts arcades to shame everywhere. Never coming back, never recommending this place that's 80% tables and chairs with an extremely small and poor selection of games. DONT GET DUPED INTO COMING HERE (unless it's free or during some discounted promotion). Expensive and waste of your time. You will get bored within 1 hour."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on the holiday Friday. Food was good and reasonable for being in such a touristy area. Convenient location if you're doing the aquarium or the CN Tower with kids. After we ate we did the arcade which was a lot of fun. They had a good variety of games with a variety of skill levels. As the afternoon went on more and more kids showed up which was a little annoying. I'd like to come back here at night. The building itself is really cool - a mix of old and new. Be prepared to spend some money though, and you'll quickly go through whatever tokens you purchase. It's all self-serve though and very easy to do."}
{"text":"Very Soso expensive food. The atmosphere is good but I recommend eating beforehand. Half of the establishment is bar and the menu is very sparse. I was hoping for more appies and finger foods. The pool table and ping pong table area  was very nice and encourages lounging, I just wish the whole place was like this instead of the huge bar/restaurant area."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food, games, and drinks! Great for dates and hanging out with friends and family!"}
{"text":"Similar to Dave & Buster's but the rec room is conveniently located in downtown Toronto, it felt more like for adults with drinks sports tv screens, compared to D&B. As for the food options, the small pizza is not worth getting, it is overpriced for its quality and quantity but the fish & chips was amazing! (You can also share since there's an option to add an extra fish, it's quite filling.)Overall, it was a little pricey with food and gaming but enjoyed my time here. If there's one thing, the washroom can use a little help to keep it clean."}
{"text":"Went to the Rec Room for the first time with colleagues. Looked nice until you start walking around. The place is more a restaurant / bar than an arcade area. Really small. So so games. Not many games you can compete with other people which is a shame. Playdium and D&B is better.   Drinks are pretty bad. They can't mix properly. Tried their Canadian mohito and was too sweet. Friend ordered an old fashioned and it looked like orange crush and tons of ice cubes. Who puts tons of ice cubes in an Old Fashioned.   In the end it's downtown so they will get the sports crowd and tourists but not sure if it will have longevity. Especially in the winter months.  Tried the VR and thought it was fun, but pricey for $28 with tax.  Wouldn't go back again unless there was a group really wanting to go."}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing food! I mentioned that I have a dairy allergy and our server was so great as to ask the chef and be sure that there was no dairy in what I ordered. I had the muscles as an appetizer and the grilled portobello caps for an entree. Honestly superb. Will return when I am in Toronto in the future!"}
{"text":"This place is alot of fun! So many activities to do : eat, drink, roam around, chill, watch a game or play arcade games. Basically like Dave and Busters but cleaner, trendier vibe to it.  There is so much to do and it's a good mix of fun or good food and drinks  This is a great place for people between ages 20-35 I think as thats the general age demographic.  Does it pretty packed though on a Saturday Night but they do have a limit.  pro tip: there is no cover!"}
{"text":"Great location and concept. The view is fantastic and the patio is perfect for drinks with friends or coworkers. Food is overpriced and not worthwhile. DO NOT get the Caesar wedge salad. I wish Gordon Ramsey could review it. THE WORST salad I've ever seen in my life. They should be ashamed to serve such a thing. Other than that, the staff was friendly and I love the idea. They should work on the food though."}
{"text":"An interesting concept in a great location by the CN tower, the Skydome, and a short walk from Union. There are a variety of arcade games on one side, a full functioning restaurant on the other and a snack bar if you don't want to sit down for your meal. A fun way to kill a couple hours of time or just to grab a meal (although it does get noisy being so close to the games).   I had the fire-roasted veggie wrap which was okay but not that interesting. Service was very nice and friendly. However, we were in a group of 6 and it took a noticeable long while for the food to be brought out. Even then, one of my friends had to wait even longer for her plate. Also, when our food finally came, they gave us a small bag of popcorn which would have made ALOT more sense when we were still waiting for our order."}
{"text":"This place is so much fun! It gets packed on weekends and the lines for popular games get long. They could make more space for more games but what they have so far is on the verge of something great. I had a lot of fun with friends on a Saturday evening even though it was super crowded. The credits aren't that expensive, either. Definitely worth a visit for those that loved Chuck E. Cheese and Playdium as children."}
{"text":"Went with friends tonight at 10pm to celebrate a friend's birthday. The website states that it is all ages until 11pm and yet I was asked to show I.D when trying to enter. I had forgotten mine by accident but am 33 years old. I was told I couldn't enter because I look young (Ok but I clearly look over 19 at age 33!!!). I explained I didn't want to drink just play games and they could even mark my hand but the bouncer was super rude and said that I couldn't enter without showing I.d. because it was 19+. Again the website states it is all ages until 11pm. Not happy at all with the service. Would not recommend this place. The staff are rude and unhelpful and clearly on a power trip."}
{"text":"Went here before a Jays game. Was hungry so got the veg wrap. It was horrible. My friend got one too and thought the same thing. I've had better wraps from 7-eleven. You should be ashamed to charge $14 for the monstrosity"}
{"text":"Amazing time. We got in and immediately got our coat checks done. Then we went to the center bar and ordered drinks. After a few, we got tickets and walker around The Yard and played a few games. Enjoyed the vibe a lot, fun spot"}
{"text":"Worst place, horrible unwelcoming and inappropriate encounter with security named Mike, insinuating we were drunk when we were not. Our party was 4 mature adults and he questioned what we were going to do and made inappropriate statements that the restaurant was formal when everyone sitting at the restaurant was completely casual. Hostess infront of the resto directed us back to the front. We just walked out, this place is a complete bs establishment."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! I've been here five times already and I've noticed that they do change up the arcade games! Please bring in DDR as a permanent arcade game"}
{"text":"Disappointing place to be honest. Website make the place seem more than it is. They are much smaller than Dave and Buster's with a small selection of arcade games. The VR room is overpriced at $25 ish per person and the food is mediocre. My chicken was pinkish in some parts and extremely dry in others.  I wouldn't come here for the food. Maybe if I'm super bored, I'll come for the arcade games though."}
{"text":"I went to Toronto on a trip and spent 3 of my days in here. The games were super interesting and the staff was nice, the prize selection was nice and the food was alright. Only had time to try the poutine and the rest of the food is kind of pricey indeed, but the poutine was tasty !"}
{"text":"The rating for this restaurant was based on the food and service. In terms of location, this place is situated in a great spot in the Roundhouse at the base of the CN Tower. It's the old location of Leon's.   Having opened only mid-June, there were a few problems with the service....at least on the patio. While our waitress was very good, there were many items on the drink list that they didn't have....yet..... and runners were constantly looking for which table to deliver food and drinks. We just had some apps. The wings were ok but cold when they arrived. Although when we told the waitress she was quickly willing to replace them.   The main restaurant inside features a wider menu and many video games in a larger format to appeal to kids and adults. It's kinda like a classier, Dave and Busters with a greater emphasis on beer and food and a great patio at the base of the CN Tower.   I have no doubt that this place will get better and more popular as time goes on. Especially given that there are few such places near the CN Tower, Rogers Skydome and Ripleys Aquarium."}
{"text":"Hot new gamers/chill spot in downtown T.O.  I really like the idea of having a place to chill with friends, play some arcade games, and have a drink with some good food. They offer a sit down restaurant, but the wait was two hours on a Saturday night.  Or, a quick snack bar that offers gourmet like pizza and poutines. And while you wait for your snack food of choice, you can order a descent size glass of beer. I ordered the original poutine and struggled to finish it. Can easily be shared as a snack for two or meal for one. I ordered a cider beer with it and they complimented each other very well.   They offered a variety of arcade/carnival like games, win tickets, and redeem them for prizes when you're done playing.  But on a Saturday night, I found it to be very cramped. You were literally bumping someone's shoulder every 5 seconds.  I also found the gaming area to be quite small for a large facility.   I love the idea of a place like this downtown. I just wished it didn't feel cramped. Maybe I'll try it again on a weekday instead."}
{"text":"I went to The Rec Room on a weeknight at about 6:30 pm. At this time there were very few kids *ideal* but it was busy with people having after-work drinks/team building. Not sure if this is typical or if it was related to the private event that night.   The location is so much more convenient than Dave n Busters and seemed bigger to me. It seemed like the place had been recently re-organized, so the games were a bit more spaced out. A few of the games were very popular and had a line, like Mario Kart and basketball, but for the most part we could play what we wanted, when we wanted. I really liked the crossbow zombie game, car racing, beer pong, and skee ball.   Coat check is a great idea - so convenient!  We also got a table at the back and ordered popcorn chicken. It was really good, especially with the sauce, but definitely overpriced. I thought the menu was a little ostentatious for the venue, but maybe they're trying to dissuade kids and families? I am down for that! Service was alright, nothing special."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to the Rec Room last night and had such a blast! We ate dinnner at the restaurant and the food was excellent. They have lots of beers on tap and great mixed drinks. The baby back ribs were delicious as well as the steak! The most fun was playing all the arcade games even tho the more popular ones were really busy it was worth the wait. If you can try as many as you can then you'll have a great time. Btw this place is huge and its an awesome spot for a work party!"}
{"text":"They think they can get away with anything by saying the word 'sorry' The service was just so awful that I can't even remember how many times they said sorry to me. I will come back for the arcades but i won't come back for the food."}
{"text":"It's a fun night out. The food wasn't out of this world, but the view from the outdoor patio is! They should put in more basketball hoops, as that is the most popular game there, but we weren't willing to wait in line to play. It's like Dave and Busters downtown. When we went, it was filled with teenagers, so I guess we are cool like that ;) I would go back. You can reuse your bracelet if you didn't spend all the money on it. I won three bouncing balls, which my daughter will love."}
{"text":"Went here randomly after visting the aquarium. Food is BLAND and over priced. You can get better quality food from the hotdog guy selling on the street for $3.50. The arcade/game selection is tiny. Youre better off going to vaughn and spending your money at Dave and Busters. Will not be coming back"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge arcade person but I loved this place. I skipped the wait and sat at the bar. The staff was attentive and friendly even though it was busy. The place is pricy but nice for a night out. It's like Dave and Busters but more upscale. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"My first visit here with some friends was in November and I came back here for another friend's birthday gathering last weekend. I think I was more excited the first time around since it had recently opened and it was fun to explore the different areas. Personally, it was just okay the second time around since I probably knew what to expect.  There are a few pros and cons about this place.  PROS - Sectioned off areas make this place easy to navigate around: coat check, prize area, several bars, lounge areas, VR room and tables for dining in - More of an upscale feel to this place compared to Dave and Busters and great overall design - Reasonable prices for buying game credits (after 2 visits, still haven't finished off the $30 worth of credits bought) - Decent selection of games (skeeball, Mario Kart, beer pong type of game, carnival type basketball shooting, air hockey, kung fu panda to name a few) - Decently priced parking lot nearby   CONS - Super crowded which makes it annoying to walk in the narrow walkways between each row of games BUT this was expected - The long wait times for some games (air hockey, basketball shooting, walking dead to name a few) - Decent selection of games but you can get to many of them in just over an hour - Coat check wait times of 20 minutes or more is ridiculous. A larger coat room is definitely needed, along with a better system!  I can't really comment on the food as I ate at other dinner places prior to coming here. The feedback from other friends was that it was alright. Drink choices and prices are on par with other TO bars.  Overall, I felt like this place should be visited once for sure... it's fun to hang out here for a few hours on the first visit. Then, return again if in the area or if there isn't any other place to hit up."}
{"text":"Fun place to visit just before a Jays game, food is bar food and not bad, great patio"}
{"text":"I came as a work outing and was in love with Rec Room. The arcade had good variety with contemporary games like mario cart and not just your old school games. I think $20 was plenty for an entire evening. Prizes were also decently priced so you shouldn't be going home empty handed. I was also very pleasantly surprised about the food. Usually food at these attraction like places are a ripoff that taste mediocre at best. I feel their prices were comparable to a pub and the food quality was definitely a nice surprise. Service was REALLY slow. Our table would leave in groups at a time to play extended games before any sight of food. Me and my friend shared the steak and the fried chicken. Fried chicken was crisp and juicy, Im not huge on the batter being oddly sweet but that's could be personal preference (friend thought it was really good). Steak was also nicely cooked to a med rare. Sides were tasty too, but nothing memorable. Portions are huge! All ladies couldn't finish their plate. They do tend to add too much booze in drinks (helps with game sales?) but all in all, would love to come again."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday. I had the Mac and Cheese. It comes in a cast iron but it was served to me kind of cold. The Patio needs lighting and they need more space for games. Good after work fun though"}
{"text":"The arcade is cool, and the ticket machines are even better. Way better than Playdium, Cineplex arcades, or even Dave & Busters. That being said, the food is also delicious (but way too expensive to make this a regular visit)."}
{"text":"This place reminded me of a more expensive version of Dave and Busters (what we have out here in the US). Fun little spot where you can eat, drink, play games (yes adults play games as well), and even catch the current sporting events (the bar is surrounded by TV's).   While visiting Toronto with my girlfriend we came here twice and both times had a pretty good time but nothing really stuck out as being extraordinary. One of the trips here we ordered two double vodka soda waters and was charged $44 CAD. At first we thought okay a single vodka soda is $11 CAD then but when we went back for our second round (we got a different bartender) our two single vodka sodas only came out to $18 CAD. Not the biggest ordeal but considering that the bartender that charged us the first time ($44 CAD) was a bit rude and obnoxious it did leave a bad taste in our mouth.   But some of the positives are they have a good amount of TV's near the bar and was very happy to see them playing American Football. Also, they have a lot of fun games ranging from racing, shooting, beer pong, etc. This is a good place to stop by if you're just trying to kill some time and aren't really looking for anything spectacular.   I cannot comment on the food mainly because they didn't have many vegan options and when we asked the bartender about vegan options he told us to just look at the menu."}
{"text":"Features a game area, a large restaurant inside with a modest sized patio in the courtyard where the old locomotive train is at Roundhouse Park.  Food was generic - typical Western food with a limited menu serving outside (pics attached for reference). I had the Chicken Caesar Sandwich with Fries. The food was average however its something I'd go back craving. Drinks are a little more on the pricier side with local draft beers around the $9 mark.   The ambiance is just right for a casual setting and there are large benches which makes it easy to accommodate groups.  Games are all new and feature large digital screens although the game area isn't as big as I thought it would be (Playdium in Mississauga is way bigger)."}
{"text":"Not a horrible experience...but I've had better. The room layout was ok, big and noisy. Sitting upstairs gets you away from the bulk of the arcade noise, but not all of it. Waitress was very friendly although getting drinks took a LONG time. Ordered food - it arrived in a relatively ok timeline. (seemed a bit slow) I ordered the lobster poutine from the poutine bar. Lobster was not fresh, tasted very much of the can it had been sitting in on a shelf for probably the last 6 months. The gravy was watery and luke-warm, fries were cold and soggy. Thankfully I DID have several beers to wash it down with so it wasn't a complete loss. I'm just bummed that for $20 for that order of poutine I didn't get fresh hot food.  I'll probably be back because it is a fun place (arcade etc) but I'll try some other food next time. Or even just regular poutine. My friends I was with all seemed to enjoy theirs very much."}
{"text":"Gord and I had lunch at the Rec Room.  It opened about six months ago.  It is a huge space (over 40,000 sq. feet) with games, entertainment and a restaurant/bar (it will have a patio in the warmer weather).   You buy a play card (using cash or Scene points) if you want to play the games.  Games started at four credits.  You can redeem your points for prizes.  We sat at a table by some big windows.  There weren't a lot of people when we got there but it did get busier.  The noise level from the games was noticeable but not annoying ... our server said, though, it does get louder as it gets busier.  I found there was a funny smell throughout the restaurant (maybe mustiness because it's an old building?).  Gord ordered fish & chips.  He said it was good (it looked good) and he'd get it again.  I ordered a chicken BLT (minus the lettuce).  It was a good sandwich and the chicken was moist and tender.  The fries were good too.  I'd get this again.  The food and beer aren't cheap ... a draught beer starts at $9 (plus taxes) for a local beer, which is about $7 elsewhere.  I thought my meal was reasonably priced but found other things on the menu priced high.  I guess things have a premium price because of the access to the games (I'm not a gamer).  Our server was friendly but he didn't check in with us between the time we ordered (I had to ask someone else for salt and pepper as there was none on any of the tables and someone else took away our plates) and when we wanted our bill.  The Rec Room wouldn't be a destination for me but I'd stop in to have a beer on the patio in the summer if I was in the 'hood."}
{"text":"Yes, Rec Room yes!! Finally something fun to do in Toronto that brings you back to your child hood. I came here on a Saturday night with a group of 4. We played games and dined. Let's start with the food: family style pizza is HUGE and TASTY! We also go a side order of fries which were small... But crispy. Also opted for the pretzel which was soft and perfect. I have no complaints about the food as some of the other reviews did. The service was good too. Also side note every table gets popcorn instead of bread to begin which is a subtle touch. The games are just like Dave and busters but way more up to date. The lines are long but that's to be expected. Honestly I'm a fan and I will return."}
{"text":"TLDR: at first I was excited to be there. Now it's kinda just meh. Good for tourists that want to play some games after Ripley's or the CN Tower.  I went on the 2nd day they were open. I went again last night. When I first went there it was exciting and new. There were big crowds and it was fun. Grab a drink. Play a new game. Wait for a shooting game behind a group of guys in suits. Grab a drink. Play an oversized app game. Wait for a racer behind a few kids on a double date. Repeat. The food was moderate but good.   This time the place was pretty empty. The excitement of a new place was gone. The energy of a lot of people was nonexistent. I feel like there were less than two dozen customers playing games, which feels empty in a place that big. This sounds like it'd be fun, because there were no line ups, but it kind of got old fast.   It was just a lot of noise without the excitement. Like being at a music festival where there weren't many people. You could see it influencing the employees too. The whole atmosphere was lacklustre. Very, as my brother would put it, \"meh.\"   If you want to play some arcade games and drink, and you're already downtown, go for it. If you're a tourist I'd upgrade my rating to 3/5 if you combo it up with attractions in the area. I'll probably go again, but only with a group where we all bring our own gamer, nerd, competitive energy. So probably not a great date spot for me, cause I'll go to win. I want people leaving with a grudge like a good game of monopoly. Ha. But ya, I won't rely on the energy of the place itself.   FYI I got the reusable band with 200 credits but we didn't even use half before we got bored and just drank"}
{"text":"For an arcade, it can be quite heavy on the wallet depending on what you do at this establishment. Although the Rec Room is no Playdium, it does offer a fair amount of machines and types of entertainment in the downtown GTA area. It can be a great way to start a weekend or before going to a party with a group of friends. It is a convenient location and easily accessible through the transit system. Personally, I would not come by again mainly due to prices but I definitely recommend everyone to come give this place at least a chance if they are in the area."}
{"text":"Not to be too harsh on my experience, but tonight has been altogether unsatisfactory and objectively bad. I don't typically leave reviews, but tonight I felt compelled to. Perhaps it's a little bit overly judgmental given this is your first couple of days. But here goes...  The bar lacks bartenders, especially during the busy hours, which is frustrating. It appears as if there is an oversupply of bar backs, or a shortage in bartenders in relativity. We waited more than half an hour for our bartender to finally get a chance to take our orders and even more time to receive our orders and, finally, to pay. She's swamped, so I'm not blaming her. But more bartenders would be nice.  The number and variety of games in the place is lacking. There's a long line for every game. Again, this may be due to traffic and opening week enthusiasm, so perhaps after waiting for the excitement to subside, we can make a more realistic assessment. That said, the option in games is a little bit disappointing. More interactive games would be nice, and more number in games would be nice. Certain games are seemingly high ticket attractions (racing, VR, etc.) but turnover is so low that it appears to be more for show than actually practical.  Our experience with VR has been the most disappointing. We paid for our tickets and were told our turn would be in less than half an hour. When our time came, there were technical difficulties. An hour after when it was supposed to be our turn, we put on our vests, and again there were technical difficulties. It took another 30 - 45mins or so before it was determined there's nothing could be done. We were asked to refund our tickets or have one of our group members walk through the experience. No. We all paid almost $30. We waited, at this point, for over two hours. We should receive the full experience or we should be offered more than just a refund given the amount of time we've wasted and given the money we spent at the bar while waiting. What's done is done, I'm not looking for any further financial retribution. For future reference though, being mindful of your customers' frustrations would build a more loyal and repeating customer base. Given the ramp-up period, these frictional issues are to be expected, but better better contingency plans are to be expected.  Thanks."}
{"text":"I'd like to begin with the bartender service. It was great and they made excellent drinks, however, the overall experience, unfortunately, calls for a one star review. If it wasn't for the bartenders, I would give this a negative one review if I could. We spent over $600 in food and drinks, were one of the first patrons there so our children could watch us sing a song in karaoke before we needed to leave. Unbelievably, even though we were the FIRST patrons in karaoke and placed our names on the list ( we are vacationing from California), the lady purposely did not play our song, probably because she may have thought it wouldn't be popular for the growing crowd. Meanwhile 11pm came upon us and we were ESCORTED out as if we had stolen or caused a disruption. Sadly, we will NOT be returning to this establishment due to the poor decision making and their inability to provide proper customer service."}
{"text":"Like the ambience. The food is up to standard. The service is really good. I suggest to all to give a time there if you willing to indulge in arcade games."}
{"text":"Lionel was our server. Great food, great service. Highly recommend the olive appetizer. Burger was tremendous too. Kids 8, 10 & 12 loved the games."}
{"text":"This place is brand new and set to be quite a staple in Toronto. Seconds away from the CN tower, Rogers Center (Skydome if you're old like me) and ACC. You can't go wrong with grabbing a bite and enjoying a unique experience of arcade and gaming with some fine dining! Great place for small and large groups, highly entertaining environment with sports on TV, arcade gaming and active gaming options, for a cheap price of about $10-20. Recommend the food, it's delicious...cheese spinach dip is chunky and full of flavour, the calamari is on the smaller side of things but very delicious and comes with a couple of rich tasting dipping sauces. The pizzas are highly recommended as they have a Italian wood oven recipe, very classic. The rib eye steak with coleslaw and fries is what I had for an entree and it was perfect...medium rare was done to perfection. The service here is superb! Attentive, quick and courteous! Be sure to ask your wonderful sever for the $5 for $10 gaming deal! Oh and please present your SCENE card for some well deserved points. To sum this place up, think Jack Astor's meets Pladium, and there you have it...Rec Room is born...enjoy 5/5 will return again"}
{"text":"i had an amazing time here with 3 of my friends! we went on a tuesday early afternoon so there was hardly anyone. we didn't get food or drink. i enjoyed the fact that everything is digitalized - no wasting paper or having to carry those tickets around. my favourite arcade games are the kungfu panda, both of the air hockey tables, and the mario carts. i honestly felt like a kid. a few things i would improve are 1. have more or better game selections since I'm so used to the wide variety at Dave & Buster's. 2. lower the price of the virtual reality game (forgot what it's called) but it's like ghostbusters"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I did not want to go here... and finish by saying I am so glad I went!!  The place is actually really cool and great for all types of groups. We stopped for lunch mid-sightseeing and I thought it was going to be loud and over priced... it was not!  The area we were seated in was relatively quiet and they have the BEST fries we have had in Canada!!! But what really made this experience outstanding was the service. The supervisor... Alex, is a small blond whirling ball of efficient and unparalleled customer service. She wowed us... not an easy thing to do... and we will be comparing all other customer service to hers... you are VERY lucky to have her!!"}
{"text":"The concept is great, but the execution and location is just very poor. I love D&B so I had very high hopes for this place and was very excited to visit for the first time. I was only in here for a good half hour before I decided to leave, I think I'll just stick to D&B or come back on weekday or Sunday nights.   Honestly I think its so extra to have guests line up outside to have their ID checked with dressed up security guards.. they were very nice, I'll give them that but it creates such an intimidating impression like is this a club or an arcade/restaurant?? The line moved really fast at least and in/out privileges were easy (stamps on your wrists... legit feels like a club at the entrance and exit but it's not LMFAO)   It was 10:30 when I got inside and I noticed that it was really packed.. and coat check was closed too so I had to maneuver (not even walk) around the place with my winter jacket... Most of the space was taken up for dining, keep in mind the location itself is already small so the arcade section is just ...so sad. Not only was there a small selection of games, the walk ways were just so narrow I felt so claustrophobic and hot. There were line ups of at least 4 people minimum ahead of you for each game! I managed to play one game though...  I didn't get to try the food because it was so packed, wait times for a table was at least an hour and kitchen closes at midnight ... tried to order drinks at the bar but it was so busy my friends and I literally stood there for a good amount of time before the heat got to us and we just went outside for fresh air.   I don't think the rec room is even worth it, $30 for 200 points when there's not even a huge selection of games. The environment just feels like a small and overcrowded club even though 3/4 of the place is a restaurant. No free parking. No coat check available at 10:30 pm.. I think if the rec room chose a bigger location and had the arcade section as big as the restaurant with better selections & with open space instead of narrow walk ways... I'd come back in a heart beat lol for now I think I'll stick to D&B"}
{"text":"I love this place. I want to marry it! lol  First, this place is bumping on a weekend night. Lots of people and lots of fun going on. Saw a couple of bridal parties = awesome.  Food = great. We got a seat pretty quickly for 4 of us. They put \"reserved\" signs everywhere so people don't sit in the dining places without checking with the front. Was a good idea, and most people were abiding by it. We had a number of beers (don't worry, we Uber'ed), a pizza and buffalo chicken bites. The bites were good, but I didn't like the sauce.  Games = Awesome. They have games. Awesome. You can play while you drink. Did I mention Awesome? We did about $10 worth of tokens, which lasted us about an hour. Lots of group games, but mario kart was the worst since there was a line up :D VR was awesome, GhostBusters!!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!! Sorry, still thinking about it.  Basically, pretty great place downtown to go and have a good night; whether with friends or on a date. As good as it gets people!"}
{"text":"Went to Calgary to visit my family we decided to have brunch at the REC ROOM. I would have to say I as very disappointed with the service, one of the worst I have had. I was uncertain if maybe the server was new, however I gave her the benefit of the doubt. It took about 20 minutes for me to get my mimosa which is something so simple for the bartender to make, we arrived there around 11:15 I received my drink around 11:45. I have been to other rec room locations where it was busier than this location and never had to wait this long. When we got there the restaurant was empty so I was confused as to why it took so long from the food to the drinks. However I have to say the food was not bad at all for what you pay for it. I had the whistle egg frittata and it was delicious, I know most people love egg Benedict for brunch but I would recommend you try their frittata. If the device was better I would have given them 4 stars."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, just go to Dave and Busters to save yourself from the headache of the downtown commute. Super packed, not enough space and not enough games worthy of playing. This place is super over-rated. Food is mediocre and service was slow. The VR experience is rather pricey but probably the only reason to return to The Rec Room"}
{"text":"This would be my second visit to the The Rec Room.  I had a horrible experience the first time.  This time around there were some issues as well.    My first visit was when they were only opened up for business within the first month. We got there and there was a huge line up for the Rec room job fair right in the middle of the dining room while we ate.  It was so distracting.  Also we had a new waitress that messed up my order three times and on the third attempt still got the wrong order.  At the end i gave up and was starving while my clients were eating so I just ate what they gave me.  When I got back to the office I ended up having a stomach ache from food positioning of under cooked salmon. I swore I would never go back.  I would give them a 1 star on yelp then if i did the review then.  This time I decided to give The Rec Room another shot since a lot of my friend never been and it's a huge entertainment complex.  Plus I was over 5 months since I was there last.  I was thinking even if I don't eat I can drink and have fun.  I have to admit The Rec Room is very impressive. It's like a more expensive and classy version of Dave and Buster. I made reservations 2 weeks in advance for a table of 20 people. My friend and I got there and I was told they needed 75% of the people to be present in order for us to even be seated. Which was stupid since the entire place was empty at 4:30 pm in the afternoon.   My friend got mad and spoke to the manager and told him it was my Birthday then they reluctantly gave us the table and told us we had to leave by 7:30 pm. I never had that request made before for such a large party and especially if not all of us could come at the same time! All the reasons why I did not want to be there came right back. But I pushed it aside. We got our drinks and food orders. I got hungry and to be safe i ordered the chicken Ceasar salad. The portion was tiny almost like a side salad with a few pieces of grilled chicken and it cost me $19!!!! Food is pricy!! Even my boyfriend got the burger and fries and the portion of the fries are so little unlike other pubs.  The service was better this time and they gave us separate bills which was great. So they improved by getting an extra star. However the food is still bland and expensive for a pub. Also the way they handle the seating situations already left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm not sure if I would comeback for food.  But I do have some leftover money on my game card so I might come back for a couple of drinks and finish up my game card.   Very disappointing since the place is gorgeous!"}
{"text":"Reviewing the food since I didn't play games (although they did seem pricey)...  Ordered: - A brie dip - literally thin layer of cheese swimming in jam (perhaps caramelized onions? Would not recommend) - Some sort of margarita which sounded good in the description but really just tasted like a mojito  Pros: the atmosphere is cool, large screens, old converted warehouse - hello aesthetics"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night for my birthday with some friends. The cost for credits were pretty cheap, now realizing I haven't used up all my credits the whole time. It was pretty busy; had to wait in line for some games but didn't take too long. We chilled in the lounge area for a bit as it was pretty empty, where we also able to play pool, ping pong and shuffle board.  Overall we had a great time, and would definitely come back, and it's in a great location: literally across from the CN tower!"}
{"text":"Long lines but overall love the vibe. You can go there to eat, drink, play, whatever. Each area seems to have its own feel."}
{"text":"Oh come on, for a Dave & Buster's copycat, I was pretty thrilled. The atmosphere was loud and noisy as expected. The games were funny and new but I have a few comments regarding the food service. First of all, may be a new venue but poor management of service. We were hoping for good food and drinks but the service had been mediocre from the beginning.  Second, do not order the organic salmon, it came barely seasoned, the green salad was sparingly dressed and the sauce was not delectable. Third, I felt that the waiters were on training and they could not remember an order if their lives depended on it. Overall, I was thoroughly disappointed by the experience. I lost my heyday and I am looking elsewhere...."}
{"text":"The rec room disappointed me more than any other place I had visited on my trip to Canada. :/  I ordered the mac n cheese ($17) and the artichoke crab dip ($16). The dip was actually really good.. worth the price being it had a ton of real crab chunks in it and it was pretty creamy which I like. It also comes with baked bread slivers to put it on which I enjoyed..  To get to the part that disturbed me, the mac n cheese. As you can see in the picture it was a mile high pile of dry noodles with melted (shredded) cheese on top & that's it.. if you study the picture you'll see what I mean.. by no means was that worth $17 and I was honestly appalled they would think that dish was serving worthy.  I am always optimistic and making excuses but sorry Rec Room, I just cannot. The service however was good and this place is HUGE! I really like the décor and feel of this place the food, however (which is what I came for) was horrid."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday with a reservation for 12 people. The process of booking was stressful since they reiterated many times that they would not seat us unless we had 75% of the party present. The day of several friends were stuck in traffic delays so I was freaking out but they ended up seating my 3 friends that arrived early anyways so unnecessary stress was caused for nothing???   Food wise I ordered the butchers daughter pizza from the regular menu and the salmon eggs Benedict from the brunch menu. Would not recommend the pizza - lotta dough, not enough toppings. The eggs Benedict was salty but a good enough meal. The presentation of the food is nice! My friend ordered an eggs florentine and it came in its own little skillet. Overall food was decent. And if you dine in then you can purchase a $10 game wristband for $5.  Now onto the games! The games are cheap and the prizes are fun but the selection is too small to enjoy spending more than an hour or two here tops. To play games you purchase a wristband. Game credits are placed on it and you tap a machine with your wristband to play. There are some kinks with this since some machines were wonky when tapped which led to tapping twice and paying twice for the game by accident! This actually happened several times with my friends. I do like that we have e-tickets on the wristband but you do lose that thrill of holding a hundred tickets. :) They have a VR where you move around in (friend described it like an obstacle course almost). May try it next time, $24/per person.   TLDR: food is decent, dine in for discounted $5 game wristband from $10. Games cheap but small selection. Reservation process is stressful.   I prefer Dave and buster more for the games but I do like the food here and the downtown location is convenient."}
{"text":"We have a similar place to this in Michigan called, Dave and Busters. Since I highly enjoy going there, I decided this placed seemed fantastic.   ****I did not play games there. I had gone to the restaurant portion of the Rec Room****  Ambiance had a very classy feel but with casual apparel.   Based on the food, $17 for Mac n Cheese was a joke. I expected a deliciously creamy and cheesy dish but what was placed in front of me, while looked appealing, was a small amount of cream sauce and just layers of cooked noodles with cheese attempting to melt between the layers.   My partner I went with is obsessed with dipping her fries in Ranch so of course, she orders some. While, in my opinion, one of the top 10 best ranches (tasted of fresh herbs), the additional cost for a little side cup was quite concerning. I mean, come on, the prices are already outrageous and then you tack on $1 extra for 2 or LESS Ounces of Ranch??   They did redeem themselves with the crab dip that comes with large florets of broccoli and a great sharing size of the dip. Presentation of the dish was something I appreciated as well."}
{"text":"Do you really come here for the food?  Probably not but when you shot a few buck in a video game, done some virtual reality, and flown an X-Wing fighter it's great to have a solid brighter!  I have to say the food isn't half bad and is pretty reasonably priced given you can't really leave.  Especially if you are visiting TO, a few beers, games with friends and a decent meal... you aren't going to be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The ambience / vibe is amazing and its located right next to Roger's center which makes is an awesome place to go before/after a game. The ceilings are super high and give off a very airy/spacious feeling. The bar area is quite nice as well (with huge TV's ) and was playing wimbledon highlights, which was awesome in my books.  Service was very attentive as well, and we got our food and drinks very promptly.  Food......The onion soup was really nice but the burger was pure grease (and black grease too). Don't get it if you go.  Also, don't bring any water bottles as the security guards make you poor it out before you go in."}
{"text":"Nothing especially new in regards to the menu. Just typical North American bar food but done very well. The burger and salad ingredients were fresh, fish and chips were tasty and the salmon salad was well done. Restaurant ambiance was pretty cool. This place is huge and they did a great job making everything look interesting. Very nice attention to detail. The gaming area was a lot of fun as well. Food Prices were a bit high but All-in all, a fun experience in a very touristy part of town."}
{"text":"We had planned to come here for a birthday and went ahead to try and make reservations for a larger group.  I spoke to an individual that gave me the email of an event coordinator, but jotted down my information as well.  With no follow-up the next day, I called and was told the reservation would not be a problem.  As we neared the day of our event, I called to confirm and was told they didn't have a reservation for us, so I asked to speak to a manager.   The manager called me back and left a voicemail and advised we should probably come at a later time than what we had told our group.   I spoke to more than 5 people in order to make a reservation that was not whatsoever acknowledged. Food was mediocre. Games were packed. More than half were fluffy prize games.   I am wary to return."}
{"text":"I've been to The Rec Room twice now and I've had mixed feelings each time. I'd give it a 2.5 stars and I'll explain why.   My first experience was during lunch time when i decided to stop by on a Saturday afternoon. It was pretty quiet and had little to no one playing their games let alone in the dining area. Our server was decent but given the amount of people in the dining area, it was surprisingly hard to track him down. It could be because of the huge area; the tables are scattered in different sections of the vicinity and perhaps he had tables in different areas. Either way, the service was mediocre. The food itself was mediocre as well. Pretty pricey for what you're getting.   My second experience was on a Friday evening around 7pm. I went with a bigger party and a couple of us went earlier to get seats. They went to the front entrance and asked for a table for 8 and were told that it was an hour's wait (and was left with a buzzer). After discussing with my party about potentially leaving, I decided to try our luck and went to the patio area to ask for a table of 8 and was immediately given a spot. How is there such a huge discrepancy in wait times? We weren't asked if we wanted patio seats at the front entrance; we would have gladly taken them.   I found it bizarre that there was no communication between the two. After ordering our food, we actually got a text saying that we could be seated inside! Again, not impressed. Service the second time around was amazing though. Our server was friendly and all smiles and we had a good time chatting with her.   The ambiance outside was beautiful with the buildings and CN tower all around , but after dark, there was no lighting whatsoever. They had some tea lights here and there but other than that, it was actually hard to see my food right in front of me. Some tables got lanterns but apparently they ran out by the time we asked for them.  Overall, I'm not sure what to think about Rec Room. It was promising when it first launched but I don't think I'll be going back. The games area is small and quite cramped so it's definitely not my cup of tea. I'd opt for dave and busters."}
{"text":"First visit to this relatively new twist on Dave & Busters...a grown up arcade with beer and sports. I like the venue, the Roundhouse is classic old Toronto and evokes the city's rail history.  The central, large bar faces a phalanx of TVs so there's always a sport or something interesting to view while socializing. Another benefit to the bar is that you can order from the full menu, which was handy as we came as a large-ish group and the wait for a table was lengthy. However I was able to get my meal and beer and join the kids over by the long eating bar overlooking the games area where they could eat pizza from the short order counter.  The gaming floor isn't as big as the suburban competition but they offer the latest and greatest including some VR games and other things I hadn't seen before.  Steady yourself for the prices however. Their 310 burger was a full $19 with smoked cheddar...and of course the cheddar had melted to a glaze by the time I got to eat it. At least the burger was a double. The fries were a tasty side and from the looks of the poutine counter menu they'd be even more heavenly dressed with lobster or brisket.   Beer by the pint was no bargain either and after a tip, a pint of Mill St original cost $12.  But plenty of activity here and the food was delicious... a million times better than D&B and with a way better view."}
{"text":"Good food but took over an hour for it to come. The manager said the order took 32 mins to complete but it was close to an hour. Then she admitted a mistake one one of the kids orders added a few mins but would not accept the fact that we had been waiting for close to an hour. The evidence was a photo we took at our table by one of the waiters that showed we had been waiting for an hour. Would give zero stars for dishonesty."}
{"text":"M and I came to check this out on a whim. I think M wanted to check out the virtual racing (which he did). I thought Rec Room was kind of tiny compared to D&B. I also find that D&B has a better variation of games. It's also a lot closer to home. Rec room also had some machines that were or of order and I found that it was really crowded and people were like on top of each other, even though there wasn't that many people.  Would I go back? I don't think so. It's too much of a trek to go for a place that's kind of mediocre."}
{"text":"This place is super cool, don't get me wrong. However, the food/service aspect could definitely use some work.   I wanted to order a cocktail off of the menu and was sitting at the bar, the bartender came over and asked for my order. I pointed to the one i wanted and asked if it was any good, his response? \" nah not really\" so i asked if he had any suggestions, he replied saying that personally he wouldn't drink anything on the menu and that if i liked sweet things i should get a french martini. That didn't sound appealing so i asked for a cosmo, before punching my drink in he goes, why don't you just get a french martini, its better. Not feeling an argument i agreed....the drink was overly sweet and tasted like fomenting berries.  I think ordered the artichoke dip as i was feeling snacky, this was just average. nothing mind blowing.   During my food, i ordered another drink, not feeling the odd bartenders comments, i asked for a gin and tonic with Hendricks. He agreed and again, upon punching my drink in, he goes, how about a cucumber gin sour instead, I was hesitant but he was pushing it saying how good it was and how much better it was so i agreed. The drink was not for me, I dont like egg whites in my drinks and this one had far too much. Also, when he was making it another bartender wanted to taste it, so she stuck a straw in my drink and capped it to get some out. A GUEST SHOULD NOT SEE THAT, SO UNPROFESSIONAL AND GROSS. There were also tons of bar staff standing around doing nothing, one girl was even icing her eye for some odd reason.   Advice from someone who worked in the industry: 1. Support your bar, you should NOT be saying you wouldn't drink anything.  2. Give guests what they ask for, this wasn't up selling, he was an ass. 3. If you're going to have a bunch of people on shift doing nothing, make sure guests cant see them.   I'd eat elsewhere and come here just for the arcade."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here. Unfortunately, it was a huge let down. Here's why: - The arcade/games section is PUNY. It's about 4-5 aisles and there's clearly not enough games to go around. You have to wait in line and end up blocking foot traffic as the space in the aisles is quite narrow. Also, some unpleasant people ended up playing game after game after game (don't be one of these jackasses), and you would have to wait for eternity or leave and wait in line somewhere else. Not cool fellow gamers, not cool.  - The pool section was dead when I went, and seemed kinda pathetic.  - I didn't try the food but my friend said it was mediocre at best.  - Prizes were actually kinda decent, but they didn't have any machines for you to scan your bracelet to see how many points you have. So first you line up to find out your ticket amount, then to collect your rewards. This wouldn't have been so bad if the lineup hadn't been so long. They really need bracelet scanning machines.   TLDR; Don't waste your money here folks. It had potential, but unfortunately it was poorly executed."}
{"text":"Walking out of an underground parking lot to a view that is worth a thousand words, there is a Rec Room that is unlike anything I've ever seen.   We have all been to Dave and Busters with it's annoying bright lights and below average menu.. but this is just the opposite. The Rec Room is new and rustic. It is literally a place of entertainment for people of all ages. It has the huge style arcade game for everyone to enjoy, the bar for the adults to get a drink or two.. maybe even three... and a sports atmosphere for any sports fan!!   Its located in the middle of downtown around so it's super easy to get to. Plus there is a lot of other activities to do once you leave.   The food was delicious and the poutine fries are FIRE."}
{"text":"The Rec Room is a great place to start your night or go for a fun night of video games, VR and fun with friends. The food selection isn't a ton, but it has its classics. Pizza, Burgers and a few other items for you to choose. The drink list is good and you can bring your drink to the game floor to continue enjoying the night. Ghostbusters is a must try!  You can acquire your game pass two ways - Though the special promotion they offer you after your meal or simply by going to the front desk. Its easy reloadable after and you can see your points through the application.  Over all, we've went there twice and have enjoyed both the food and the experience each time."}
{"text":"Day date alert!   I live with someone who loves their job. Loves their job so much, he often lets his hours creep up to 45, 50, 55 and sometimes more. Every so often I (super gracefully, naturally) demand he take a teensy bit of weekday time back while our wee one is kicking it with other kiddos.  On a Friday not too long ago, following a meeting, I knew exactly where to ask him to meet me. A weird bright place with drinks, games and surprisingly delicious food. Poutine for everyone!   The Rec Room is yuuuge. It has all of your childhood arcade favourites on steroids, silly prizes as you leave, a full bar and two full restaurants. It's Cineplex's downtown answer to Dave & Buster's. Normally, these places aren't my thing, but if you're willing to lean into the cheesiness and nostalgia, you're going to have a fab, fun-filled day!"}
{"text":"Popcorn at midnight!  DJ played retro old school top 40! Ate a salami pizza.   Funky decor and laid back layout. Arcade area is jammed and busy but offers decent choice of gaming  options. Wished there was more though, Dave and Busters still has a better range of activities.  Location thought can't be beat, right cross from the CN tower and Ripley's.  Enjoy a gaming night out with friends on any occasion!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday during the Jay's game and it was fairly empty in terms of customers but overcrowded in terms of employees on shift. We walked into the dining area and no one came to us to seat us for 10 minutes while there were a good 20 people standing around doing nothing.  The menu was small in terms of food but the patio was mainly for people looking for an afternoon drink. Prices were fairly high for what there offering, but it's again the location and proximity to the ACC that makes this place seemingly attractive. The salad was okay but in weirdly large chunks.  The games were new and fairly fun but really messy in the way it's set up, it's a lot smaller than D&B/playrium and they probably could have opened up the space more because the narrow walkways were a bit claustrophobic after everyone came in from the games.   Nice location, nice atmosphere, nice idea but lacklustre in service, food and execution. It's still new though so hopefully they'll make some changes."}
{"text":"I know everyone goes here expecting it to be busy but I feel like they could have throught of a diffrent way to buff the noise in the dining area.  We got togather for a friends birthday and had to ask to be moved further away from the games as screaming children were a constant thing.  I had the salmon handheld sandwhich. The insides were more suited for a wrap as nothing stayed inside the bread very well.  I didn't really eat my fries as they were way too salted. We did try a couple diffrent drinks. It was odd the ceasar was topped with salami and hardboiled eggs. We really enjoyed the broad daylight drink. I'd never had one before and it was a good combo of flavours. Games were okay. I would recommend you come on a weekday when its less busy as friday was packed"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with the family. The only detail I see is that the prizes at the end are too expensive and kids get really disappointed. Other than that a good place to visit"}
