{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this food! I order from Olio every single time I stay at the Sheraton on Dixon Rd & that's a few times a month. I don't even bother going downstairs, we just order room service. They now have Gluten Free Pasta which is Delish! They are very accommodating to any needs or requests. Definitely order or eat this food! It's amazing."}
{"text":"Service was slow, server made multiple mistakes with drinks and also made a very rude sigh when I showed him the free desert coupon for checking in on yelp. Waiters attitude changed as soon as he got back with my free yelp desert, also he tried to keep some of our change at the end. Also ate here yesterday and had great service but the messed up on stake 3 times."}
{"text":"We were accompanying a friend here for business in Toronto near the airport.    Best calamari we've had.  Ever. Anywhere.  Very light batter. Perfectly cooked. Not rubbery at all.  My partner loved this.  And he doesn't even like calamari! Definitely order it. 10/10+  Maple Arctic char was good 8/10.  Well-cooked, nice accompanying mushrooms, heirloom carrots, etc.  Halibut was only ok. A bit dry. 6-7/10  Paella also ok.  Not super-authentic, but decent. 7/10.  Tomato-red pepper soup. Fairly yummy, light. 8/10  Crab cake appetizers 6/10. Ok taste (actually a little tasteless), a bit too mushy, not crispy enough in the outside.  Dessert? We ordered tiramisu (more whipped cream than usual , but tasted light and good), bread pudding (\"alright, not extraordinary\") and an Irish coffee (7/10).  Overall?  Decent restaurant at Sheraton hotel by the airport.  Convenient if you're in the area. We've also been to Chop Steakhouse in the same hotel when family was in town for a quick layover (which is more crowded)...more standard steak joint.  I prefer Olio. Not extraordinary (apart from the calamari), but convenient location.  A bit pricey (~$20-30/entree), but that's rather typical for all these hotel restaurants by the airport ( for the better ones anyway).  Service was fairly attentive (although place was pretty empty when we visited at 8 pm...although its adjacent bar section was pretty crowded)."}

{"text":"Elegant spot. Friendly staff. Great food. They also so reserve for big groups. Also conveniently located."}
{"text":"The meal was one of the best that I've had. Unfortunately didn't get pictures of the main meal, but did get the deserts and the deserts were free with a voucher when you check in with yelp. \"Bonus\" very professional waiter and the food was piping hot, which doesn't happen often. We had the trout and the bolognese for main meal. Both were excellent, especially the risotto that came with the trout. The deserts were equally delicious, but they were out of the rocher that day, little complaining here though, seeing as we got the deserts free anyway! I highly recommend this restaurant and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is a must try!  Simply an elegant, affordable and open establishment.  The warmest and friendest staff you will meet.  5 star service all around.  I have eaten at restuarants across Canada and around the world because of my profession and Olio is a place worthy of repeat!  I will definately return if i am in the area and i full recommend it to you.  Food is flavourful and moist with impressive presentation!  The fried tilapia was perfect!  Well done Olio, well done!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately the food was awful. The service was great, but nothing tasted good. I ate the lamb and at first it was served without all the elements of the dish on the plate. Flavours were very bland. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"They only loose a star because of our salmon was a little over done to my tastes. I like my salmon done lighter. Unsure if the wild salmon has to be cooked until tight and flaky. It wasn't dry, just cooked until a little too   tight."}
{"text":"Love this place whenever I'm by the airport. Been here twice, both time I had the red pepper soup, and the pasta with meat sauce. For desert also enjoyed the apple and postacio ice cream. Recommended."}
{"text":"Now usually Yelpers never disappoint with their recommendations. But I wasn't too fond of this place. Ordered the chickpea dusted calamari which was average. And tried out two difference fish dishes- barramundi and the catch of the day (which was the rainbow trout). Both dishes were served with a mountain of rice (totally unnecessary). Not to mention that I've never seen a fish prepared with tomato sauce. Both dishes had a layer of bad-after tasting, thick tomato sauce that took away from the entire meal. Not impressed.  Quite surprised by the reviews here actually."}
{"text":"The food was great. Service was on point and the atmosphere was elegant. We loved the Olio Meza Platter-Hummus, babaganoush, muhammara, warm pita. Each dip was amazing."}
{"text":"Food was lit Highly recommend  Service is good Drinks are good Inexpensive and food seasoned well"}
{"text":"I visited Olio during lunch on a weekday. From the photos, I thought it would be bigger than it actually is. You can see right into the Sheraton lobby while you are eating. It's not as elegant as some of the reviews I've read on Yelp say it is.  We started off with the crab cakes which were great. I also had the chicken and brie panini which was also good. My experience wasn't spectacular so I would prefer to eat at the other restaurants options by the airport."}
{"text":"I was very pleased I chose to give Olio's a try.  I'm always leery about hotel restaurants but no reason for any concern here.  A pleasant greeting and at 5:30 I had my pick of the restaurant.  Overall very good service.  Efficient, friendly and always there at the right time. the food?  Excellent.  Nice selection of breads with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  I started with the kale salad.  Greens were fresh and crunchy.  Wonderful dressing.  Good size portion.  The 10oz sirloin was cooked to perfection.  Superb char, very tender.  The mashed and veggies were an excellent accompaniment.  I checked in on Yelp and got a free dessert.  The chocolate lava cake was disgustingly delicious. Highly recommend.  A bit pricey but no surprise given that it is in a Sheraton but no complaints."}
{"text":"Hmmmm....this is your typical hotel restaurant. It's located in the Sheraton and the bar area is quite big with lots of seating.   The food is a little better then hotel restaurant food but don't forget it's also pricier then you would want to pay. Most of the people here (like myself) are traveling for business so that's the kind of crowd that you would get. I can tell you that the bartender here makes pretty heavy handed drinks - so that's nice :)"}
{"text":"I had never heard of this restaurant, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  It's a hotel restaurant inside the Sheridan, close to the airport. The restaurant was empty, as hotel restaurants usually are, unless it's during the week when people go on business trips. The decor was standard for a hotel restaurant.  Entering into the restaurant there was a beautiful French song about \"soixante neuf.\"  Oh brother.  Anyway, this restaurant is part of summerlicious.  They apparently ran out of oysters for dinner (which was one of the choices for an appetizer), so I had a tomato soup (there was also the choice of salad), a steak, and a tiramisu.  The soup was ok, I tried some of the salad, and the dressing was amazing.  The waiter was great also, and he brought some very nice complimentary bread, with a great spread.  The steak was rib-eye, a great cut, was seasoned perfectly with sour cream, mashed potatoes, and vegetables.  The steak was on par with ruth's - it was amazing.  And the portions were huge.    The tiramisu was also first-rate.  It was light, and beautifully presented - 3 ice cream scoops of it.  I think it would have been a great deal at $35, but it was only $25.  This was one of the best meals I've had in Toronto, and would definitely recommend coming here before summerlicious is up.   Their mains alone are usually $25.  I'll definitely come back if this restaurant participates in winterlicious."}
{"text":"Brunch, what can i say about brunch at Olio?  I would give it 10 stars if i could.  What an amazing place to go for the extended family get together over a fantastic meal.  The service was prompt and excellent, the tables are far enough apart that you don't feel crammed in and the seating is comfortable.  Now for the food, where do i start?  From starters and salads, various fruits and appetizers, pastries and cold cuts.  All of which are top notch.  As for the main course items, its something to behold.  Very tasty and creative choices.  The prime rib was above excellent, the seared salmon, great choice, the pork tenderloin, tender and unique sauce with stuffing, quite original i must admit.  The eggs Benedict was spot on.  Not to leave out some other items, such as sausage, bacon, waffles etc, but of all the side dishes the potatoes really stand out.  Now if you think that's it, guess again, there were deserts to please everyone.  Creme Brulle cheesecake, tarts, chocolate mousse cake, strudel, and a few others, leave you satisfied.  Now for honorable mention, they serve Starbucks coffee.  Yup, if you want a nice meal for a group or a family or date night, this is a great place to go.  One thing is for sure, we will be back.  This was the best brunch i have had this year."}
{"text":"We had our doubts at first as this restaurant was inside a Sheraton hotel, but the reviews looked good so gave it a shot. Great food service and presentation. We will be back. I ordered the mushroom linguine and olio salad and was pleased."}
{"text":"10 oz steak was delicious! Staff was also very friendly. Definitely we shall come back again. Maybe even tomorrow :)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed, came here since I was in the area and the reviews looked good. I got the 6oz steak and shrimp, asked for medium rare but it came well done. Everything was extremely salty and I could not finish it, the steak was tough and very dry. Only the calamari we ordered was good. The service was okay, average at best. Mostly disappointed at the food, I had to chug water after which is not a good sign for a restaurant of this price and caliber."}
{"text":"The food here was absolutely amazing ! I had the 8oz sirloin with mash and broccoli . Checked in and got free dessert . Pecan pie . YUM  The steak was cooked to perfection ! I like mine medium and it was on point . Literally melting in my mouth . The gravy they paired with the mash was heavenly .  Our hostess and server were lovely and extremely professional .  The bartender however was kind of aloof and I didn't like the bottle of red our server recommended but all and all an unforgettably enjoyable experience ."}
{"text":"The best hotel restaurant I've ever been to for sure! Trout and bolognese was wonderful. Got free dessert for both of us too! Waiter was really nice even tho he got quite busy."}
{"text":"Well, it was okay. But really I won't be back. Service staff was excellent and very friendly. Just expected way more with those prices!!"}
{"text":"Olio is a nice little restaurant attached to the Sheraton on Dixon Rd right off the 401. The place itself is real nice and the seating/ lounge area is a nice little place to relax. They also have a bar and several TVs scattered about. The menu here says Mediterranean, but had more of an Italian flare with paninis, pastas, etc (though technically, Italian is part of the mediterranean....)  I had the Olio Classic Burger, being that I went for lunch. The paninis and mains looked enticing, but just wanted something rather quick. The burger was large and juicy. Provolone cheese and onion strings melded nicely into the burger and they had their own special spread, which I didn't really notice much.  Prices are a bit higher than you would like for a lunch, but is on par with places like Jack's and Boston Pizza. The server was super friendly and the atmosphere was very relaxing. Probably a nice spot for a business lunch as well. Would come back to try some of the dinner entrees too."}
{"text":"I have a lower bar set for restaurants in hotels - they are not quite as bad as airport food, but not to the level as what you'd find in the heart of a city. I wouldn't necessarily call this fine dining, or go out of my way to come here, but I had a good meal and it was super convenient and seemed to be one of the best options of what was around me.  Not surprising, the crowd tends to be business travelers and I was happy to sit alone with my laptop and get some work done during my meal. They brought out a nice variety of bread and crackers (3 crackers and 4 pieces of bread). I also had an appetizer, entree and dessert to round out my meal. If you check in on Yelp, you'll get a free dessert.  Frisee and Arugula Salad with Toasted Goat Cheese ($10) - For $10, there was very little salad and way too much dressing. I felt like I was eating salad dressing with salad instead of the other way around. The toasted goat cheese was a huge slab of goat cheese on a piece of toasted baguette - it probably negates the healthiness of the salad. I wouldn't get this again and wouldn't recommend it.  Maple Roasted Artic Char ($24) - This came with potatoes, mushrooms, and leeks and a mustard vinaigrette. I really loved this dish - it's better than some fish dishes I've gotten at fancier restaurants. The maple flavor was subtle and combined really well with the savory and slightly tangy flavor of the mustard. The fish was fresh and moist - all around, a great dish and I'd highly recommend it and would come back here again just to eat this.  Warm Bread Pudding ($7) - You can't go wrong with bread pudding - it was warm, not mushy, and not too dry. The vanilla ice cream on top was the perfect compliment. It was free because I checked in on Yelp, so no complaints here.  All in all, a great choice if you're staying at the Sheraton or near the airport. I really liked the fish a lot - it was a very memorable dish and not overly expensive either. I was happy there were healthier options to choose from the menu. My total meal (with free dessert) came out to just under $40. 5 stars for a hotel restaurant and for a dining option by the airport."}
{"text":"Very Good Carrot Soup... Oysters were not great... Lamb was overcooked... Too expensive for what they deliver..."}
{"text":"So I think the best way to rate this restaurant is to divide it up by food & service.   The Food...I ordered the 10oz Strip Loin with mashed & veggies. The Strip Loin was undercooked  & had way to much grizzle running through it making it tough to chew. The mashed were the garlic mashed from the potato pearls, not real potatoes but tasty nonetheless. The Caesar dressing was tasty but a little runny. What was really good was the Molten Lava cake w ice cream...THAT was delicious!  Now to the service....it was slow & rushed all at once. The waiter was clearly rushed & was unable to provide quality wait service. He was perspiring, harried & impatience combined. A fellow diner saw him roll his eyes when one of our diners took their time in ordering....that's NOT COOL if your a waiter! In his defence it was Valentines Day & the restaurant was quit busy but not packed. He lacked the training & skill to effectively deliver service during this time of operation.   In my opinion given the combination of service, food & timing (Valentines Day) this all adds up to only a 3-Star Restaurant."}
{"text":"We stopped in here after a 5 and 1/2 hour flight from the USA. We were hungry, without a car and feeling dismal about our culinary prospects. Luckily, this little gem of a place saved us from fast food or the hotel convenience store. It's located in the Sheraton hotel next to Chop.  We had the crab cakes, which were very meaty and served with a spicy aioli. They were quite good. My wife started with the seafood bouillabaisse and had a grilled calamari salad as her main course. She enjoyed both. I chose a 12 oz. strip loin cooked medium-rare with a side of jumbo onion rings. Cooked perfectly, and the sides were great.  Everything was good quality and the service was excellent. So much so that when we spent our final night near the airport, we ate here again! Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"I visited Olio over the summer for a Yelp brunch event.  I am usually apprehensive about buffets, and I guess it is wrong to assume that the food will be sub-par because of the volume that needs to be created. However, I was blown away by the quality of the food and the number of options we had to choose from at Olio. The spread included pastries, salads, breakfast potatoes, fruits, eggs Benedict, roast, waffles-the real kind-exactly like the ones you get in Belgium (I was in Belgium over the summer), seafood, among other things. I was specially impressed by the eggs Benny-I couldn't believe how perfectly cooked the eggs were.  Brunch is offered every Sunday from 11:30am-2:00pm. The price online says $17 for the buffet breakfast, but I don't know if this is the price for the Sunday brunch as well.  Though this was a private event, I really hope that the quantity and quality of the food at the event is what they would serve on a regular Sunday.  It always worries me that restaurants will be on their \"best behavior\" when trying to impress a bunch of bloggers and reviewers, though I have a feeling that Olio offers great food on a regular basis. I have read many reviews (on Yelp), and people seem to really enjoy dining here. I wish this location was not so inconvenient for me (I live downtown), or I would have returned for brunch already. If ever in the area, I will definitely give their regular menu a shot.  **Note that this restaurant is located in the Sheraton Toronto Airport Hotel. My friend and I got lost trying to find it because I did not know that the restaurant was in the hotel, rather than on its own.  http://wp.me/p2mHMr-19J"}
{"text":"Beautiful space, the most comfortable seating!  Wait staff and hostess are all delightful...On Christmas Day no less!  Candied butternut squash soup is very thick and sweet, with curry, which I love!  Unfortunately, waaaay too much pepper added by the cooks, burned my mouth within the first 2 spoonfuls.   Bread service was very disappointing.  Bread is literally cold  out of the fridge!  And the olive oil side tastes as if it's gone bad; the balsamic is very very cheap, and unfortunately, it tastes it!  Surprising for a quality hotel like Sheraton!  The raw oysters were good, although not separated from the shell.  And.  There were pieces of shell with literally each of the 4 oysters. The sauce with them was incredible!   The beet and goat cheese salad was underdressed, but once I got more dressing, it was  excellent! Lovely dressing!  Pretty colours!  And I love literally anything with goats cheese!    The turkey main, well, thank God for dark meat!  It's impossible to find turkey dark meat on menus! The gravy was so incredibly flavourful!  Unfortunately, the veggies were seriously overcooked.   They also charged me $2 for extra gravy, but gave me a horrible, funny like water e.g. jus, instead.   I would very much like a chance to speak with hotel and restaurant management.   This is way below the standard for a Sheraton...or at least I thought that it was until now.  Dessert buffet?  O M G.  A CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN.  SERIOUSLY.  'NOUGH SAID!   Happy Happy...... Merry merry!   Kisses.   Hugs!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. The restaurant is really nice and clean. Service was good. I had the fish and chips. I loved the fish but the fries and side were kind of salty. I could have totally had double the amount of fish. My boyfriends butter chicken with naan bread and rice was really good. I'd recommend it for sure."}
{"text":"I went here for all you can eat breakfast and it was great!  This restaurant is in a hotel near the airport.  They have the regular breakfast foods plus more, like a cheese and olive spread, greek yogurt,a cook to make yummy omelets, with potatoes and bacon on the side.   They also serve freshly squeezed orange juice that is included in the buffet.  I recommend this place for a grand breakfast!"}
{"text":"Conveniently locate at the Sheraton hotel. Great for those grabbing quick meal and go who stay here. Tons of parking available. Decor is nice, upscale. Great for family gathering and special occasion.  Service is good, friendly and attentive.  But If intimate atmosphere is what u are in for, look else where as they have a pool table section on the other side of the large rm divider.  Good though, unfortunately is average, not quite justify for its price tag IMHO.  Beards are fresh but not kept warm till serve.  Had a crab cake, real crab but 1/2 of the cake was barely lukewarm, 1/2 of it was noticeably hotter. Likely precookled and microwaved.  Taste was bland. Its side cherry tomatoes were funny as they still have cold core, potentially defrosted from night before. Server respectfully returned the dish and apologized for the crab cake.   Tired their catch of the day the Arctic char for $24 was cooked pleasantly well, lightly seasoned, meat just flaked, very moist; the skin was seared just right to crispy not charred at all /overcoooked.  The side potato nugget was tasty and had nice texture. Dish presentation though can do more attention to details as the side veg didnt look green, on the overcooked side; not crisp on chew. Also there was a ring of oil splash on the edge of the plate, it likely had been sitting beside the stove for awhile waiting for the fish.   They also honored the free dessert with yelp checkin. Overall, more rm for improvement but if you are looking for a nice place for a huge nice family outing, this is a place to consider."}
