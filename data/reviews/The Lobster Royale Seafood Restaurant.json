{"text":"Went there this past weekend with the wifey and we both loved it. The service was friendly and helpful, and the food was great. I've had better lobster in boston, but that's obviously an unfair comparison. By Toronto standards, it was really really good. 

Wife and I both got the set dinner, which includes: garlic rolls, house salad, lobster bisque (freakin delicious). , lobster (steamed or broiled) and a side (fries, baked potato, rice), and a soft drink. I came in famished and left stuffed. For the both of us, I paid $100 incl tax and tip.

If you're looking for a classy, upptiy fine dining restaurant, this ain't it. It's a family owned gig with a friendly atmosphere there. 
But If you're looking for a casual, unpretentious seafood restaurant that serves good food at a reasonable price, Lobster Royale is the place for you."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! 
I've been coming to lobster Royale with my whole family for over 15 years, bisque,  garlic bread, oysters and a 1.5 lobster is my go to meal. Never disappoints. 
I do recommend making a reservation, I've been turned away on a Sat night since they were full."}
{"text":"1 for service and not being accommodating at all. When you order a few lobster dinners and a 14 year old wants chicken fingers since they don't eat lobster .. Don't ask if they are 12 and refuse to serve them and force then to order a crappy adult chicken dish."}
{"text":"On average, this place is no more than 3 stars. Some things are great, and some aren't. The reason I come here from time to time is because of their incredible Lobster Bisque soup. I crave it once in a while, so I usually take it to go. I get it with a basket of garlic bread, which is nothing special. I personally don't like actual lobster, or other seafood besides fish, so there really isn't anything for me here except the soup (I ordered the fish once and I make it better at home). I should probably add it is overpriced, as is everything else - $8.50 for a small bowl, before tax. However, my family likes the lobster here. Since I don't eat anything else, I've ordered the burger a few times, and it's awful, even the presentation of it is a disgrace. What mostly bothers me about the place is the service. The servers are often condescending, and have this aura about them as if they think they are better than you, and my family and I can really sense it. It's like the service is meant to say \"we don't really care about you, we know you'll come if you want our food, so we don't really need to pretend to care.\" They don't do anything at all to make you  feel like they appreciate your business. Atmosphere and service is really important to me, and there just isn't anything warm about this place."}
{"text":"Not sure why anyone would give this place great reviews because I will never be coming back to this restaurant.  First of all, the place is SUPER outdated and in desperate need of a makeover.  If you are charging so much per plate at least give your diners a nice atmosphere to eat in.

Anyways onto the food.  The only thing I liked about this place was the o-so oily garlic bread.  They give you alotttt and its super buttery with tons of garlic bits and herbs on top.  The ones with the crispy edges are the best! (only reason why this place isn't getting 1 star).

I had the seafood platter.  This came with fried shrimp and scallops, crab legs and halibut.  The shrimp and scallops were DRY and the batter it was fried in was horrible.  I didn't eat the crab legs so I can't comment on them.  The halibut was okayyy. It has a batter around it as well and I picked off the bottom side because it got soggy.  The seafood here sucksss"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This is a lobster place. I'm not really a lobster person, and went for dinner with the extended family, several of whom are lobster aficionados. As I didn't try the signature dish, I may have missed culinary genius of some sort, so the below may be a little harsh. But here goes...

This was a time-warp back to the 1970s, a \"fine-dining\" restaurant that doesn't appear to have changed their menu, service, etc. in a long, long time. The centerpiece of the menu was - you guessed it - lobster. Your lobster can come steamed, broiled, thermidor, newburg - you get the idea. The folks who ordered the lobster seemed pretty happy with it.

There is a variety of other seafood on the menu as well - shrimp (generally heavily breaded or deep-fried), scallops (heavily breaded), halibut steak (fried), crab legs (heavily salted), seafood platter (combinations on the above). The garlic bread is dripping with butter and garlic. Are you noticing a pattern here? They seem to be focusing on lobster here because the rest of the menu will leave you with various stages of coronary disease, which isn't good for repeat business.

A few other scattered observations - the service was glacial (they didn't take drink orders - we just went straight to ordering), the steamed vegetables were clearly freezer-burnt (rubber carrots, anyone?), the highlights of the wine list were \"Chardonnay\", and \"Pinot Gris\", and for all of this, the prices were not cheap."}
{"text":"This place is a Thornhill classic.  It shows since it is in desperate need of a makeover.  Still the good quality has remained consistent and the service is always friendly.

My favourite is the lobster bisque, which is prepared just the way I like it.  Not sure why anyone would go to Red Lobster next door when this place is an option."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is shockingly outdated, down to the finest detail.  It's cramped in the booths.  Yet it's clean and relatively comfortable.

A look at the menu pricing seems inappropriately expensive for a dingy joint.  But we stuck with it and bravely ordered - non lobster dishes.

Service was slightly friendly and fast.  

Both appetizer soups Lobster Bisque and Clam Chowder were very good.  Real meat.   Real garlic bread was served...tasty and heavy.

Seafood platter was pretty good, the crab legs and breaded shrimp were excellent. The fish was okay (breaded and mushy).

This restaurant is worth trying, we may do a repeat visit.

Thanks to Bold C. for the review."}
{"text":"I celebrated a few birthdays here, including my birthday...  loved their lobster bisque, their garlic bread (Albeit no more than one ) and of course the fresh lobsters from the tank!!!    prices are quite reasonable. 

if you do not like lobster, you can also order steak, salad, fries but who will want to do that when there is LOBSTER!!!!!!   

A round table is also a bonus in my eyes when you have a group of four or more..   

Reservations needed (a must!!).. 

I definitely recommend this place as it is good bang for your money and guaranteed you will have a wonderful time whether it is with friends, family, loved ones."}
{"text":"Must try the Lobster Bisque! Even if you don't care about anything else on the menu (honestly, it's lobster, I doubt that, but just in case), this is a MUST order. Creamy and filled with lobster chunks. They definitely don't hold back.

Service is wonderful. I really enjoy going to family-run restaurants, as they put out a lot more passion and pride in their food. 

As for the food itself, ordering the combo set dinner is quite worth the value. Comes with garlic bread, the lobster bisque (omg,  so good), lobster (with a choice of it steamed and broiled), a side dish (baked potato, fries or rice) and a drinl. I prefer my lobster steamed, as you taste the natural sweetness of the lobster meat. 

Note: Make reservations. They do turn away customers if they're booked for the night. Because it's just that good."}
{"text":"I was just there tonight with 7 other friends. I have to agree that the food is good but the service is quite bad. This is a family runned business and they obviously know that people go back for the food instead of the service so they did slack off.

The lobster bisque is a must. It's creamy and thick with alot of lobster meat in it. I ordered the broiled version of the lobster which is pretty good. The combo is definetely worth the price.

We had to split the bill so each person can pay their own portion and I guess they were not so happy about the fact that we had to split the bill among 7 people.

Food is good not impressed by service. I use to always go back but maybe it's time to look at other options."}
{"text":"Awesome Lobster dish varieties! :) 
I love their lobster bisque! It's thick & creamy with lobster bits in it. 
It comes with garlic bread too. (They gave out soo much bread.. 3 /person when I went!)

I'd recommend the steamed lobster rather than broiled one. I tried both and thought the steamed one was more delicious; the broiled one didn't bring out the fresh lobster flavour as much as the steamed one!

Service was good. We made reservations ahead of time and got a table the moment we arrived (Despite the groups of people waiting for a table.) I'll definitely come back for more yummy lobster dishes! :D"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Lobster Royale for years with family, friends, and special dates. As always, their garlic and escargot are amazing and my favorite is their lobster bisque. There's no doubt that they do lobster right too :) 

Service could use some improvement and so could the furnishings. I can't help but wonder if they dust the nets they have hanging around the restaurant. Very clean space otherwise :)"}
{"text":"OMG does this place need a huge make-over!! Anyway enough about the irrelevant stuff. It's called Lobster Royale so lets stick to our friendly crustaceans, shall we? We ordered a pound and a half lobster and a pound of Alaska king crab legs. Although the lobster was very tasty, the crab was sweeter and more tender. Unfortunately we knew this would be plenty of food (and it was) so we did not get to try the bisque. There's always next time!! The service was great, brought garlic bread immediately, always refilling our water, it was not slow, I think we had three people serving us at one point. My only \"beef\" is that they only had their house wines available by the glass -one red, one white-, and since the hub does not drink ... anyway, the wine was ... white. Worth a visit!"}
