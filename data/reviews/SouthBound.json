{"text":"Absolutely FANTASTIC!  Allow me to take you on our culinary journey (full disclosure, I've been stalking this place waiting for it to open, and was rather disappointed to read so many unfortunate reviews ... but here's the thing, people need to realize this is NOT a Mexican restaurant, it's SoCal inspired.  It's street food ... it's not queso and refried beans and rice and sombreros and maracas and Aztec decor).  
Moving on, the atmosphere and decor is awesome - it definitely offers a relaxed vibe.  The walk to the restrooms, while long, is pretty cool - and the tub sinks with shower head faucets are a really cool touch!  
As for the food, we started with chips and pico.  Goodness, the chips were warm and crispy and the salt sprinkle was perfect.  The pico I wanted to drink with a straw it was that amazing.  
We then ordered tacos.  Our server perfectly explained the Machaca Beef (and she was right on point), and I also ordered Chicken Adobe.  The beef was SO flavorful and awesome.  The Chicken Adobe I added a bit of mild salsa to it and that was a fantastic idea on my part.     
Let's talk salsa bar ... for those of you complaining, guess what - Sabor (a Latin American/Mexican style restaurant) has a salsa bar which is often times disgusting since the ice has melted and salsa is floating around the remaining cubes.  At least SouthBound doesn't waste product since the salsa cups are the PERFECT side for a taco!  (And the SouthBound salsa bar ladles are no different than the sauce pumps at Viva Chicken...everyone touches them, just like menus, so wash or Purell your hands!)  
We also ordered Street Corn which was freaking awesome!  I seriously wanted to duplicate our entire order and eat it all again that's how great the food was.  We decided to end with an order of the churros ... hello love child of funnel cake and warm doughnuts!  So good!  And yes,  I had an \"On Tap Margarita\" and found it to also be good.  
Here's the deal, everyone is entitled to an opinion, and everyone has different taste buds and food preferences.  However, for the love of all people involved in what I hope to be an incredibly successful restaurant, GIVE THEM A CHANCE!  Visit on your own, don't just sit behind a keyboard and take the opinion of a stranger over your own.  Sure, wait a few weeks if you'd like, but definitely support the SouthBound crew ... and more than once.  How would you feel if someone met you and hated you and never gave you another chance? You're probably a pretty cool person ... but relationships take time.  If I knew you, the first round of chips & pico would be on me!  Enjoy Yelp people, and good luck SouthBound crew, I wish you luck!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service.   For 3.50 a taco I was definitely let down.  The taco shells are about the size of a drink coaster.  They are tiny tacos.  Got three tacos, that did taste great but I left hungry."}
{"text":"They don't deserve their current rating! My husband and I both thought that every aspect of our time there was fantastic. The atmosphere is supper cool, service was great, the chips and salsa are delicious, the food was stellar. Between us, we had all of the tacos on the menu (hold your judgement) and each one was delicious. The street corn was also really good. 

If you're holding out on this place because of a few early reviewers, I would definitely suggest going and giving them and honest try. We will definitely be back, loved it!"}
{"text":"So the environment was great, the drinks were decent but the food was a total disaster. Everything was under seasoned and it is very pricey for the portion sizes. We waited for an hour and a half for Chicken Mole (shredded chicken & two tortillas) and shrimp empanadas. I have to agree with the rest of the reviews about street tacos & prices.... this should definitely top considerations. 

The atmosphere and the waitress saved them from a lower rating. 

I would however recommend the churros, they were amazing! Maybe consider heating the chocolate instead of serving it cold!"}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to love this place.  I was seriously stalking it for months.  Let's start with the Architecture---AMAZING!  Beautiful design, very airy and open, exposed beams, etc.  Food.  Welp...this is where they really flat line.  The tacos (corn and flour) are super small, slightly smaller than the traditional Mexican taco. They only use 1 piece of corn tortilla.  Come on guys, everyone knows you need two.  I had the Camarone, and the Asada.  Both were pretty bland, even though the steak was cooked to perfection, it just lacked flavor.  We also ordered all the dips for our chips.  The chips are great, hot, salty and fresh. The guac was super good and the ceviche was lacking the fish.  Now the bar.  This is where you get a little P.O'd.  There drink prices are outrages.  They're good, but damn, $12.00 for a Southbound Margarita, in a 12 oz class.  Stop it!  

Step it up Southbound, you have the perfect location that amazing or not, people are going to come regardless.  But please, choose amazing!"}
{"text":"We had a great meal here on Thanksgiving eve.  Loved the free chips and salsa and really, really loved the pitcher of tasty margaritas.  The veggie tacos were super delicious, but the salads were just ok...needed more of the toppings. One of the salads struck me as the same as one at Mac's next door. Super fun music playlist and a great atmosphere. We will be back soon to see how things progress."}
{"text":"Not sure why the low stars. We thought they had great tacos and quick service! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Moving to Charlotte from Phx AZ, this place is as good as it gets as far as south west Mexican food. Food was great, so glad i have a place to get a California burrito now. The tacos were awesome. Not really sure about charging for chips, thats kinda odd. The service was a 3 out of 5 at best they were in training and really nice but slow. The drinks I would say 3 out of 5. I know they just started up and I'm hoping they will work the kinks out, would love to see this place do well."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican places in Charlotte. Not only is it located in one of the hottest spots in Southend, but there is plenty of parking. I have been multiple times now and love the outdoor seating area. The wait staff were very friendly and immediately brought a water bowl for my dog as soon as we sat down on the patio. 

The salsa bar..... oh my.... they have the BEST pico de gallo I have ever had. The food is delicious, and the salsa bar is the cherry on top. We tried each of the tacos and were really impressed! Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Food and service were terrible. Rip off. No excuse they know better. Stay away very far away."}
{"text":"Like many others, so I will brief:

Atmosphere: GREAT!  As good as it gets.

Drinks: Had better.  Poor selection.  Don't ask for a drink not on menu.

Salsa:  Salsa bar is great idea, horrible execution.  Micro ketchup-style paper cups...really???

Tacos/Food: Ever heard of seasoning?  #ApparentlyNot

If this place does not fold in six months, I will go back.  Has potential to be the single most awesome joint in town.....but will never be until they get a new chef....and better management."}
{"text":"Totally underwhelming. Ordered civiche that was basically pico with two or three small pieces of white fish. Told the waitress. She said thanks for the feedback but still charged a 150% premium over pico. Taco was mediocre. Service was slow."}
{"text":"Pros:
 - Cool atmosphere that opens up to the outside
 - Decent cocktails

Cons:
 - Food is subpar and bland
 - Very bad service.  Uncomfortably awkward waiter and it took nearly 30 minutes to get a check"}
{"text":"I came to SouthBound on Saturday night with my boyfriend and another couple. Because we hadn't heard great things about the restaurant, we planned to grab some drinks, chips, and 1 taco each before committing to a larger spread. Three of the four of us tried the margarita with the multiple fruit juices. It was okay, and in my opinion, mainly tasted like a regular margarita. The other guest ordered the sangria. I'm assuming it was a seasonal sangria because it tasted like cinnamon. Overall, for the price of the drinks, we were not impressed. Though we ordered chips and pico to start, our tacos came out first. I tried the vegetarian taco on a corn tortilla and although it's tiny, I didn't finish it. All I could taste was spice and corn tortilla. The poblano peppers overpower all of the other flavors. The rest of the group also felt their tacos were bland. When the chips and pico finally arrived, we were again in impressed. The chips needed salt and the pico cup wasn't even filled to the top. Needless to say, we did not order any other food and I will not be going back. There are far better places to enjoy tacos and margaritas in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"In my visit, the food was bland and the guacamole was, as one reviewer accurately stated--essentially a smoothie, but the dessert wasn't half bad. The atmosphere is certainly worth a visit...but maybe just for a drink."}
{"text":"Great spot to if you're into Mexican style food. Drinks were good, food was good as well. Prices are actually pretty good too. Looking forward to going back and trying a few things on the menu that caught my eye."}
{"text":"As someone who owns a hospitality & F&B establishment, I waited for a couple weeks after opening to check out Southbound. Its especially difficult for new restaurants to work out operational kinks when the opening is accompanied by tons of PR and enormous crowds.

I stopped by this week and had a great meal and a few drinks. It seems like most of the early negative reviews have been corrected...the menu included descriptions of each dish, there was little to no wait time and the service was excellent.

I also thought the portion sizes were perfect. If you're looking for a massive burrito the size of a brick with 5,000 calories then you can head to a sloppy tex-mex joint."}
{"text":"Much anticipated and huge let down. Space is great but service was slow and food was completely unremarkable. Bland guac, chips you could buy at Costco, and the tiny tacos lacked as much in flavor as size. Will say there was a decent amount of meat but, again, where's the seasoning? 

To be competitive in South End's booming restaurant scene, there has to be something at least slightly special. Guessing Southbound will make it on cocktails and location, but really hoping they step it up. Taco trucks certainly have nothing to worry about!"}
{"text":"Excellent, nutritious Tex-Mex! Fresh ingredients are used in their creative take on Mexican food. The portions are ample and choices are varied. There's a nice bar vibe and a casual feel to the place. This was my second visit and both times the staff was friendly and attentive. Super excited to have good Mex on this end of town!"}
{"text":"Generally the food was okay but not great. For starters the chicharrones - they are not the typical fried pork but more similar to the air popped ones you get in a bodega for $.75 - why is this even on the menu but whatever. I ordered the steak burrito which was ok  but it's not very difficult to put steak, cheddar and guacamole in a burrito. I tasted the meat without all of the extras and it definitely tasted like old beef. The beans it came with were not really seasoned either. 

Drinks - there was no pineapple juice so had to order the patron with some lemon/lime juice. The gin and tonic came without a lime - little things like this make a difference. 

The hot sauces are at a \"station\" ::struggle face:: - by station I mean walk up to a qdoba like sauce bar, fill up a tiny cup and walk back over to your seat. 

Need to work on the overall experience and quality of food in order to be a successful restaurant, especially right next to Mac's."}
{"text":"Came here last night with my boyfriend (and dog) and was pleasantly surprised. The reviews on here were and are pretty harsh but we wanted to give it a try and form our own opinion. We arrived around 7:30pm or so and there was a 40 min wait (although I don't think we waited that long.) The staff was all very friendly and the \"horrible\" guac I had read about was actually pretty good.  I ordered a carne asada taco dish with beans and everything was good but the serving proportions did seem off as I was given way too much meat and a very large bowl of beans which were both too much given I only had two tacos to eat them with. The sauce bar they have is a cool idea but I would rather not have to get up from my table just to add condiments so I can eat my meal. Churros with chocolate sauce were delicious!

Overall, I would come back - the atmosphere is great, doesn't feel overly crowded or too loud for conversation and they are pet friendly. As any new restaurant that just opened, I am confident they will use the feedback to work through and make improvements."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great, a lot of open space. Drinks were good, food was tasty and quick. However, guac was too blended/smooth for my taste. It looked more like soft serve ice cream than guac."}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere!  They have updated their menu to add a few new items which are fantastic. Try the California Fish Burrito and Shrimp Enchiladas. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I just had an awesome brunch...street corn, spicy Caesar salads and so-cal Sangrias...not to mention the bottomless chips and salsa - the salsa is also excellent, by the way.

Madison was wonderful and really attentive. 

I'll be back.

Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Bit of a wait; but lots of bench seating so wait not bad. On tap margaritas and beer selection are great. Our waitress KY was friendly, efficient and fun as was front desk.
Food is reasonable and fast.
It's great!"}
{"text":"I had a great time here. The atmosphere is nice. We sat out on the patio, and the weather being great made the trip worth it. I had a margarita, it was great because it wasn't too sweet like most places make them. 
For an appetizer, we ordered the chips and guacamole. I'm so happy that they make their guac in house, it tasted fresh. I also had the cucumber salad. I loved it because it was simple, clean(health wise), yet full of flavor. I love onions, so that was a plus. 

The tacos were delicious! And portion size, just right. I don't know why other people are complaining about the size of the tacos. Just order more! Order enough to fill you up. This is SoCal inspired, NOT TexMex. If you're looking for large plates of re-fried beans and sour cream, you're not going to find it here. This is SoCal Mex-type food that won't make you feel guilty after consuming. So if you're health conscience; but in the mood for a fiesta, this is where you'll find it. 

Also the manager Jamie checked up on us and was very nice and accommodating. Our server (Ashley; I believe) was super helpful in helping us choose which tacos to enjoy. I'll be back for sure. This is also a fun ladies night spot as well."}
{"text":"The kiddos and I went today for the first time and we loved it! We had a late lunch so it was not crowded. The service was excellent and the decor made me feel like I was at the beach. But let's get to the food.....
First up, guacamole which was good not great. It was pretty bland and I like bland food so it definitely could have used a kick and some garlic or more lime juice for most people. The chips were very good and refills were free.
Next we had the Mexican street corn and it perfect! Sweet, tender and tasty. 
On to the tacos, we had a fish, beef, pork and chicken taco. All on flour tortillas and all were delicious!  We sent the fish taco back because it had tomatoes on it and got a new one right away. 
Kids meal that my daughter had was the old standard, chicken fingers and fries. She gave them both a thumbs up.
Finally, the meal ended with three churros in chocolate sauce for only $2.50! Churros were very tasty and some of us even preferred them sans chocolate.
Overall, a great restaurant and even enough of a crowd pleaser to be added the the rotation."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences I've ever had. We walked in and it took 10 minutes to even get someone to get us a table. It was empty. Once we got a table the salsa took another 5. The waitress came up smelling of cigarettes and proceeded to know nothing about the menu. That was before the food. The food came out and I think I would've preferred Taco Bell. Actually just not eating would've worked too. We complained after I found a hair in the \"free\" salsa. He really seemed to care. He informed us that he didn't believe and to maybe even care. Once our food came an hour later the chicken was uncooked and cheese almost melted. I could go on but I'll choose to leave it here. Bottom 1 worst service, food and employees I've ever experienced. If you've heard this place has improved after a bad start, don't believe it."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in town after having moved from Charlotte a few years ago. As we were driving to the Uptown area the lighting and decor of SouthBound caught our attention so we decided to venture in. 

We were greeted and welcomed at the door by the hostess and manager Jason. We were seated promptly and that was a good thing because this placed filled up quick on Saturday night and stayed packed. Ashley our server was great. She was very attentive and always made her way to make sure that we were good. We had the shrimp ceviche which was good but the shrimp enchiladas were great and the side of pureed black beans was delicious (most places don't puree them). You could actually taste the shrimp unlike some places that use baby shrimp. Jason came back around to make sure that everything was good with our meals and we thought that was great considering how packed the place was.

Definitely not what we expected but a pleasant surprise and we will certainly be coming back to this place on our next visit to the area."}
{"text":"Service was great consider how crowded it was for a Saturday night. Atmosphere is also awesome. 

$5 guacamole & pico is super small. Guac reminded me of the kind mixed with Greek yogurt they sell at grocery stores. 

I had the braised beef plate and the meat was delicious. Beans were ok, but no one goes out for the beans. 

Churros were awesome and cheap! I'd definitely come back for atmosphere/once some of the kinks are worked out."}
{"text":"I see mixed reviews, but the place and food are really good.  I'm not traditionally a big fan of Mexican food, but this is not your typical Mexican cuisine, it's so much better.  I started with the guacamole, which was really fresh and great tasting.  They don't put a bunch of ingredients in it, and it works.  The fish tacos are excellent, cooked very well with a very fresh taste to them.  Again, this is not your run of the mill Mexican cuisine.  The service at the bar was really good, albeit the hostess at the front couldn't figure out for the life of her how to spell the name Neil when friends and I first thought we would get a table.  It was kind of funny, well, perhaps not for her."}
{"text":"I should pre-face this review by saying that we visited on Taco Tuesday, where tacos were $2 and marg pitchers were half off ($13). I have a feeling my review would change slightly if it was a normal time, since the prices are a bit higher.

Parking- Parking in this area stinks. They really need to figure this out. On a Tuesday, we had to find a spot in no mans land as all the lots and street parking was full....on a Tuesday. 

Atmosphere- We elected to sit outside. I absolutely love the open air section! Nice atmosphere to just chill.

Drinks- We ordered the pitcher of margs since it was $13 on Tuesday. Tasty marg and I love the cups with a straw that they sent out with the pitcher.

Food- Chips and salsa came out in plenty. The saltiness on the chips was perfect and the consistency of the salsa was done well (ie. a good balance of chunky and saucy). We got 6 tacos to share. Note: While these tacos are very full, they are the smaller ones. (hence the 6 to share). We got two carne asada, two white fish, one chicken, and one pork. The carne asada and white fish were definitely my favorite and my husband liked the chicken the best. The pork one was just ok. 

Service- Service was very good and attentive. 

Overall, I like this place. I think the atmosphere is fun. Like I said earlier, I do think being there on Taco Tuesday really influenced my review (a $26 pitcher of margaritas normal price sounds steep to me!) but my husband and I had a great Tuesday evening out at Southbound!"}
{"text":"What a great addition to South End! GREAT drinks, great food, and great service (thanks Brittany!!) 

We had a group of 4 go to the grand opening last night. Yes, we had to wait for a long time, but hey - the bar area was awesome and we expected this considering it was their first night open to the public. 

The vibe is really cool and it's an unexpectedly large space. This place is going to be great. Immediately we had service once we were seated, Brittany dropped off waters at the table and we ordered drinks: a Bloody Maria (Bloody Mary with tequila, yum), some tecates (when in Rome), and a few margaritas (get the pineapple one, you will thank me). We ordered chips and salsa and they have an extensive salsa bar which I frequented throughout the night. Get the white salsa.. I put it on everything. Literally. 

On to the main course: tacos. What's not to love. We all got a mix: I had the beef and the fish tacos. They come on corn tortillas (which are made in-house by the way, you can see them make them), and have fresh toppings. Everyone else ordered a mix of tacos as well. I'd recommend ordering 2-3 tacos a person. 

All in all, great job you guys. This place is going to do very well, it's a great space in a great area, and I can't wait to come back. Cheers and best of luck."}
{"text":"I was invited for food tasting today. Excellent authentic fish  tacos with an amazing flavor and crunch.
Must try the corn and the fresh lime drink.

Excellent atmosphere, excellent menu, great drinks with indoor outdoor cali feel.

Should open next week, South Bound has an amazing curb appeal starting from landscape with river rocks plus sexy lighting all the way to the interior decoration and the palm trees.
A great place to celebrate friends and birthdays as well.
Oh last but not least we loved the fresh Churros.

Thank you
Sam"}
{"text":"We visited on Taco Tuesday-excellent value on Tacos and Margaritas!  This place was clean and our server James was knowledgeable and courteous.  The food was AMAZING (carne asade tacos highly recommended) and the chips and salsa were also delicious.  Everyone should try this awesome, chill restaurant.  Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Loved the So Cal menu. It's lighter fare so you're not going to go away feeling stuffed but you're also not going to be hungry. I had the ceviche and carne asada taco both were very fresh and flavorful. The only thing I would change is to opt for the flour tortilla instead of the corn because it fell apart; but I kind of expect that with a corn tortilla. I also had the El Bandito margarita, it had a smokey flavor to it. My mom had the South Bound Rita which was also very good. I will definitely be back. I like the smaller plates (price also fits the smaller plates) because you can get more if you're still hungry where as other places you end up overeating."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this spot! I had heard mixed reviews so I was eager to try it out for myself. Margaritas are on tap and still taste pretty good! They have specials on marg pitchers on Tuesday's which I'm definitely going to have to check out. They also do $2 Tuesday taco specials. 
Food was good and had awesome flavor. I was disappointed with the presentation of the rice and beans (side of my tacos). It was all beans with rice sprinkled on top. Not my fav. 
Overall, love the atmosphere here and can't wait to come back to enjoy the outside seating in the nice summer weather!!"}
{"text":"We tried to dine here last night around 8:15.  The dining room was only half full, with a number of empty tables.  The hostess informed us that there was a 45 minute wait for a table.  We left and went to Tyber Creek, where we easily found a table and the food was delicious.    

Based on this experience at Southbound and the poor reviews I've already heard, I won't be back."}
{"text":"For starters, if you like sour cream, don't come here. They don't have any. At all. The atmosphere is pretty nice. Also, if you order the standalone tacos, they come with toppings (onions, lettuce, sauce, etc.) but if you order the plate, they don't, which doesn't make sense. Tacos were not very flavorful...probably because mine didn't come with toppings because I ordered the plate. The Taco Bell across the street is a better choice."}
{"text":"I have been waiting to try Southbound for a few months now and after having Sunday drinks at the bar a few weeks ago, it was time for food. I made reservations for fifteen friends on Tuesday. Taco Tuesday aka my birthday! 
Our server took great care of all of us. She was kind and constantly checking on us. 
I loved that salsa! So you do get chips and salad when seated at the bar or table. I did ask about the salsa bar, since I read reviews prior to coming. Our waitress said they didn't have it anymore but she would bring me salsa if I wanted to try them. 

I had the chicken, fish and pork tacos. I was impressed by how full and good they were! 
Nick at the bar also took care of a friend and I after dinner, making us some yummy margaritas! 
Southbound has a very open feel and bright decor. I enjoy my evening there and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"THANK GOD FOR THESE AMAZING CHICKEN TAMALES!!!

It's nice to see a restaurant go out on a limb and do it differently from Cantina-which has its following.  This restaurant will find their following, too.

Thank you for authentic flavors and spot on beans!!

-a Southern California Native in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Love the crew here and love the biodegradable straws!  Saving the Sea Turtles one margarita at a time!"}
{"text":"Keep in mind this is the first night open. They did not know the menu what so ever. 

Drinks: ordered spicy margs. Say they didn't have them but it's not hard to make a margarita spicy. They came back with a regular margarita with chopped up bell peppers. GREEN BELL pepper. Hah this is not a joke. 

Apps: ordered chips and guac. It's about enough guacamole for 1/3 of a person. Go to chipotle next Store for guacamole that is surprisingly better. 

Tacos: super yummy and fresh. Carne asada, shrimp, and fish all super good. Definitely hit up the salsa bar!

Atmosphere: wonderful! Hot new spot and I like the ambience and music"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were pretty pumped to see Southbound opening right across the street from us last year. It had a ton of potential with a lot of space, good vibes, cool bar, and a tasty looking menu. We went here the first week it opened and left unimpressed with the tasteless food, margaritas, weird serve yourself 'salsa bar', and poor service. Understanding that it takes a restaurant some time to get their feet on the ground with the service and menu, we finally decided to give it another shot months later. Needless to say, we will not be returning. As much as I would like to describe the food as tasteless this time around, I can't, because it actually just tasted bad. We had the guacamole and queso to start. The guacamole was far from fresh and the queso had a texture that would make quicksand seem runny. I got the fish, chicken, and beef tacos for dinner. The beef tasted like they ground up some mulch and shoved it in a tortilla, the fish was spoiled and chewy, and the chicken was less than desirable. All of our food tasted like it had been sitting out for hours and our waitress made it seem as if we were a disservice to her by asking for anything. I am generally not one to write negative reviews but this place just left a bad taste in my mouth, literally. 

Oh yeah, and I forgot to mention that they use paper straws for their margaritas which is just the absolute worst."}
{"text":"Tried every kind of taco - every single one had dry meat. Terrible tacos. The chips were extremely greasy (???). Took at least 20 minutes to get drinks, and then we had to chase down our waitress to order food. Margaritas got mixed up and they were not good. And getting our checks was confusing and hard. Would only go back if I wanted to sit outside and drink beer on draft."}
{"text":"Originally gave this a 1-star review after an awful dining experience shortly after they opened. I revisited and am now a fan.  Overall solid food and pleasant service, good place to sit outside on a sunny day. Beer situation is improved but still lacking.. luckily bbq joint next door has excellent beer selection."}
{"text":"Tiny tacos, very little meat, poor service, stingy salsa bar with micro sized cups, small soft drink glasses and no offer to refill, dirty glasses with lipstick, just overall poor quality and way over priced. Go there only if you do not value your hard earned dineros."}
{"text":"Just not good.  Spend your money at one the fantastic restaurants on either side of this spot."}
{"text":"Wow is the first one I can use to describe this place. I'm a so cal born and breed and I heard about this place being a so cal theme Mexican restaurant and said hmmm I'll have to try it.  I've heard good and bad things about it.  I've seen people complain about small plates but in so cal that's authentic to have small plates. Small plates=more dishes=you trying more stuff. The carna asada taste just like back home going out and getting some. I was very impressed with it and will definitely go back. Street corn was also just like back home. Me being a so cal born and breed I was blown away by this place. Out here it is hard to find a good Mexican place where you want to feel like your just at home and this is definitely the place and definitely the place for me. I will go back and continue to go back after that.  Worth the short and even worth a long drive."}
{"text":"Restaurant was full and service was still really good. The food cane out really fast and was really good. The salsa tasted really fresh with alot of flavor. I had  rice as a side that was kind of bland but overall the meal was really good and we would def go back!"}
{"text":"Ate at Southbound with my wife after learning that my friend just started working there.  They are affiliated with Mac's which is also good.  It was Taco Tuesday...so when in Rome...we had Tacos.  Tom stopped by and made good suggestions.  Bartender was friendly and offered good drink suggestions.  We were there for late lunch so I can only imagine how it is when full.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Something is totally off at SouthBound and this new establishment is heading \"SouthBound\", fairly quickly. Not sure they can kickback from the numerous and highly visible gaps. Ambiance is incredible, yet you can feel, see, and hear other customers disappointment come across with unspoken vibes. Service is a complete joke, inexperienced, young, and unprofessional servers. Last but not least, food.... hands down ... absolutely either zero flavor or disgusting flavor. Pico de gallo is made with pickled juice/onions and taste awful. Guacamole is disgusting and tasted frozen. Even store bought guacomole  taste better! Save yourself disappointment and do not give this a try. My group literally left and went and had dinner at their sister restaurant- Macs. Sat next to a regular patron which had a very similar take on South Bound. Needless to say, South End is disappointed, we all wanted to love this place."}
{"text":"Right next door to Mac's speed shop.  Stopped in here for dinner and a Margarita, Margie was too sweet and wasn't made to order.  The chips and salsa were good but the menu didn't entice me to dine here."}
{"text":"I've been a little hesitant to try Southbound given the reviews. I did today and had a great experience. It's a very cool space and the staff is friendly and attentive.

Food was good and the customer service was excellent! There was a small mix-up on my order and they proactively went above and beyond to address it. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I brought my relatives who were visiting from San Diego. Although the place was packed the new staff was courteous and friendly. We ordered one of everything to sample the variety. Everything was good and the salsa bar had a good mix of flavors. There were a few minor issues which are to be expected during the first week of operation. The food is a little healthier than I was expecting and portions were a bit smaller than I'm used to. Just what the doctor ordered ;) I'll be back for more Machaca beef. That was the bomb."}
{"text":"We had a great meal, I think they are trying hard to fix their issues they had starting up. We had delicious queso, guacamole, and the steak and chicken quesadilla. All were delicious and hot. They were even nice enough to turn on the heaters for us so we could eat lunch with our dog on the patio. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Nice indoor/outdoor feel! Had the tacos and they were good and the service was great. Went for lunch to get a quick bit. We enjoyed our time and they have parking!!! Nice!"}
{"text":"I probably would not have written this review except that I heard that the chef thinks that the people who do not like the food at this place \"are Charlotte and don't know Southern California.\" Hi - I'm a born and raised Southern Californian living in Charlotte, with experience eating at taco joints up and down the coast from San Diego to SLO at a multitude of price points, and I can tell you, I would not stand this place up against any of them. The basics - the guacamole, salsa, and corn tortillas they make in-house - totally lacking in flavor or texture. (On these fronts, I think Southbound should take a note from its neighbor, Bakersfield). The fish tacos were all breading, and my ceviche just had sad, tiny pieces of fish swimming in citrus. (Perhaps it was a pipe dream to think I could get a good fish taco outside of my home state, anyway.) This place will stay open on the strength of its location and venue which is REALLY cool. So, we'll probably go back for that, but I may stash my own guacamole in my purse."}
{"text":"I LOVE the ambiance, decor, and location of this new swanky restaurant. I came in just to check it out because I've watched it be built for some time now. A friend and I sat at the outside bar just to grab a few drinks upon my arrival back in town. For some reason it seems that customer service is not held in high regard anymore. We sat at the bar and was poorly greeted by one of bartenders. You would think that everyone would be excited and have lots of enthusiasm, and tidbits to share about their new place! I had to ask for an explanation about the concept of the bar, which is something that should just roll off the tongue. You know I don't know what this is after three days of opening. None of the open ended questions that I'm sure even the owners would want asked. Another bartender did explain her favorite drinks and sold me on one of the apps (pork rinds), which I LOVED. Smart menu item. I loved my experience overall, but please get your staff together and explain to them the importance of being excited about where they work and having an inviting aura. I dine out often and love to feel welcomed. It helps me spend more money."}
{"text":"Was actually trying to locate another restaurant I found on Yelp, but drove by Mac's on the way and decided to give it a try. I am glad we did. Covered picnic tables out front and an open air bar area. We chose the bar area because it looked like rain was coming. (It did.) Sophie was our server and she was great. A dish of tiny hush puppies and sweet butter was brought out right away. Free of charge. They were yummy. We asked Sophie for local beer suggestions and she set us both up with beers we enjoyed; Catawba white zombie and Cavendish Grizzly brown. We decided on the Big Pig and green bean casserole and the Philly brisket wrap and sweet potato fries. All was great. Big Pig had coleslaw on it and Sophie suggested a house made red sauce. Green bean casserole had lots of French fried onions. Glad we found this spot. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Absolutely my new favorite spot. Atmosphere is great and the food... you won't find it anywhere else in Charlotte. I just moved here from SoCal and it's the real deal. The staff is also super friendly. The bartender Aaron is great and can offer suggestions if you need help picking from the yummy menu! Thanks for opening up guys!"}
{"text":"Wayyy better than the 1st month of opening. Gave it a 2nd try this past week and food was flavorful and our server James was awesome. Definitely recommend giving it another try."}
{"text":"Food was lousy and not authentic. Got the California burrito and they put French fries inside. Who does that?  Fries ended up soggy and burrito was bland. Mediocre pork carnitas. Only redeemer was salsa. Good salsa. Service very slow."}
{"text":"Great vibe, great staff, great food! Will definitely be back. Their carne asada is rich and flavorful. Great bar selection. The decor is nice. GM Tom was super friendly and helpful. Lots of smiles and attention from the staff as a whole. Food could have sucked and I still would go back because I still had a great experience. Fortunately the food is quite good!"}
{"text":"It's been a couple of months since my first visit...and I think they deserve an updated review. 

I came back for Taco Tuesday to give them another try. A few updates to share - the chips and salsa are now complimentary! Also, they got rid of the salsa bar and mini paper containers. However, they kept the paper straws. Ugh. 

I tried a few tacos - I was impressed with all of the ones that I tried. But I think my new favorite is the machaca beef. It's so many flavors packed in one taco. I added the smoked jalapeno sauce and it was divine! 

All in all this place is A-OK if you're looking for your taco fix on a Tuesday."}
{"text":"The location is so cute and trendy! The margaritas are very good, so you definitely want to get yourself one. The guacamole was terrible! They say they make it fresh daily but it looks like it came out of a bag like squeezed out and with no flavor. There is a salsa bar but you have to pay for the chips - the sauces were pretty good.

Would go back just for drinks."}
{"text":"After recently attending Southbound, a local restaurant with southern California flair and the perfect menu accompaniment, I walked away happy to finally have a place that served something that wasn't your basic burrito, nacho, tex mex vibe. We had two drinks, a pacifico on draft that was very reasonably priced at $3.50 and an on draft margarita called Southbound 'Rita at $8 which is very competitive to the $10 margaritas you find around town. We only came in for drinks but after sitting at the beautifully decorated bar that gave off the perfect feeling of southern California taco joint and speaking with the general manager who recommended both the Carne Asada taco and the fish taco we tried both. 

I highly recommend the tacos on the corn tortillas and using some of the sauces from the sauce bar. They were perfectly sized, flavored and priced for a southern California fresh taco. 

Anyone who says that there food isn't mexican has never been to southern California, this place is the epitome of a southern California taco restaurant with the open spaces, the color scheme and the menu. Second, anyone who said service was tough, it was slow or anything related to that has never opened a new restaurant. They opened two weeks ago, have had two weeks of great weather and tons have hype. They've been slammed with the sheer volume of people they've had to serve and I know that the owners, general manager, and staff will figure it out. Using history as a lesson, the ownership group of Macs Speed Shop has 6 restaurants around the Carolina region and has been expanding since their induction in 2005, i'm sure they will work out any kinks in the new restaurant and I will absolutely be returning. Five Stars."}
{"text":"I've been to Southbound twice since they opened.  My first visit was not impressive, the service was subpar, the food was decent, but I did like the atmosphere.  That in mind, I decided to give it a second shot as I worked in the service industry through college and I never form an opinion on one experience.  My second visit was much worse!!  I ordered the Baja fish burrito and switched the guacamole out for pineapple because I am allergic to avocado.  I made the server aware of this allergy and when the food came out it was full of guac.  Honestly, that was no big deal because I know how easily these things can happen in a busy kitchen.  It was the response from the server that rubbed me the wrong way.  When I showed her she said \"ok\", no apologies at all.  Next came my drink... I ordered a jalapeño margarita.  When it came to the table a huge black hair was floating in the top (picture atta.  Again, I made the server aware.  Her response... \"alrighty\"!!  Not once did a manager come to the table to address the situation or apologize.  Other issues were food came out cold, requested salsa was not brought out, and a long wait time for drinks.  At the end of the day things go wrong in the food industry, but it's how you manage the situation that makes the difference.  I can safely say that will be my last visit to Southbound."}
{"text":"We waited to visit the much anticipated SouthBound, after reading Yelp reviews when they first opened.

We wanted to give them a solid few months to get on track with their F&B and service standards...I'm so glad we waited and didn't end up ruining anything out of the gate.

We have visited twice now -- once for dinner and once for a late lunch.

Their menu isn't very large, which I don't love, but on the weekends, with their additional brunch menu, it helps to bump up the offerings (which means, y'all, go for brunch on Saturday or Sunday instead of dinner).

The first visit I ordered the pork carnitas with no taco--they were accommodating of my gluten allergy and even substituted the sides for me. This doesn't always happen easily in a Mexican restaurant -- which reminds me..this isn't Mexican food. If you go looking for the usuals, you might be disappointed. This spot melds the flavors of Mexican and Californinan cuisine. Instead of feeling disgusting from rice and beans and cheese when you leave here, you might only feel half as gross.

The next time, I ended up with the Coctel de Camaron which is a version of shrimp cocktail in clamato juice with TONS of avocado, like seriously, did they stuff a whole avo inside? #notmad. Also enjoyed fried plantains and quinoa. YESS on the alternative grains 

The man had a burrito which he really enjoyed. He didn't, however, like the charro beans,  and noted the flavor \"just wasn't that good.\" His spicy margarita was a bit lacking, but overall the space really speaks well to a casual crowd looking for some good-cleaner-ish bites.

I'd really like to see that once spring hits their menu gets a little bit of an expansion and maybe a refresh of sorts. There is a ton of potential."}
{"text":"We took our family here tonight.  Low expectations going in given the yelp score but we were extremely happy with the meal.

Our server, Ray, was great.  Super attentive to our kids and their meal.  Made it easier to enjoy our meal as parents.

I was craving true California fish tacos, so I ordered the California fish burrito, which was exactly what I wanted.  I would go back just to grab that burrito.  My wife ordered shrimp enchiladas, which were excellent.  Should also mention their housemate roasted jalapeño hot sauce - I couldn't get enough:

Bottom line, great meal and good for kids.  We'll be going there regularly for something slightly different than Sabor (another favorite)."}
{"text":"I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. After all of the backlash that happened right around their opening, I decided that I wanted to wait until they had more time to work out the kinks and revamp any problem areas. I'm so glad I did. 

I went last night with my wife for Taco Tuesday (any taco is $2, and margaritas pitchers are 1/2 off). To start, you now get complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa they served was good, like damn good. I was surprised at just how tasty it was. At the recommendation of our server, Candace, I tried the Carne Asada, Chicken Adobo & Whitefish tacos. The asada was the clear winner for me, followed by the chicken and lastly the whitefish. The piece of fish on mine was a little too much breading and not quite enough fish for me. The asada & chicken were loaded with meat and toppings, though. 

Our server Candace was a 5/5. She was friendly, helpful & attentive. She gave us great recommendations, and was even extremely knowledgeable about the various types of tequila and tequila flights/pairings that they do."}
{"text":"I was disappointed... the space is so modern and cool. Looks like a great place for cocktails and a good snack/ meal. But the drinks weren't great and the food was worse. The food was dry and the drinks were bland."}
{"text":"I don't review restaurants to often, because I typically believe your experience alone doesn't tell the story.  Unfortunately, I feel obligated to write that SouthBound was disappointing.

We sat at the bar, service was slow at best. The bartender could have used an extra set of hands, he was busy, but couldn't keep up.  

Food. It was OK. I won't say it was bad, but I can't say it was worth the trip.  When compared with similar restaurants in the area (Babalu or Ru Ru), SouthBound is significantly behind. I ordered the Machaca Beef.  The food came out quickly, mostly because the entire meal is pre made (shredded roast beef, a side a beans, and a little side of salsa). I will say the tortillas are great!

My wife and I decided to leave underwhelmed, and had a snack and nightcap down the road. You"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. I tried the Cantarito cocktail at the waitress's suggestion, plus an order of tacos (carne asada & Baja fish). Both were great. The food was very fresh and the people were pleasant. Management also gave a personal touch."}
{"text":"Enjoyed brunch here. Chorizo tacos were delicious. Great vibe. Good cocktail menu. Friendly service. Reasonable prices. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"As a Southern California native, born and raised in Los Angeles, I couldn't have been more thrilled when I heard this place was opening. I've been hard pressed to find good, authentic Mexican food in Charlotte besides the taco trucks on South Blvd since I've lived here the last two years. Sadly, I couldn't have been more disappointed after finally eating here this past weekend.

PROS: 
1. Atmosphere is hands down amazing. Probably the best I've experienced in Charlotte. Whoever designed your decor is a visionary. (Except the music, see below)
2. Margarita was decent, but I'm not much of an expert on those.
3. The chips were PERFECT. Good chips at Mexican Restaurants are few and far between. Bravo on the chip front!
4. Server was a nice guy. Very few complaints, except he referred to California as \"Cali\". Nobody says that there, people. It's \"California\", \"CA\", \"SoCal\", or \"NorCal\". Cool? Cool.

CONS:
Where do I even begin?? For all the talk of being an authentic SoCal Mexican restaurant, this place fails on so many levels.
1. No complimentary chips and salsa. What?! That's like a staple. This isn't even my worst complaint though. 
2. I read the review about the guac but didn't want to believe it until I had it myself. My husband and I both remarked how it tasted cold, like it was refrigerated. It was creamy like store-bought guac and had like, two little tomatoes in it. No onion. No cilantro. I couldn't even taste lime in it. It wasn't yuck but it wasn't restaurant quality. AUTHENTIC SoCal Mexican restaurants don't pre-make guac and refrigerate, it's made fresh. And the quantity was laughable, see other reviews here for reference. I beg you, Southbound, to start making fresh guac, or be really cool like El Torito and make it fresh at the table. 
3. I agree with other reviewers about the menu, it's confusing and doesn't explain much about what each thing is. I can understand someone not being familiar with this cuisine and being super lost.
4. I was SO excited because I heard that they hand made their tortillas. If you've ever had hand made tortillas, you can tell the difference. Well, I ordered the carne asada platter with the beans. What came out was two lukewarm deconstructed tacos with tortillas that tasted store bought. There was nothing on the meat at all, just a \"dash\" of pico de gallo. My husband had a ton on his plate so I had to steal some for mine. The carne asada itself was cooked well enough but tasteless and bland. No seasoning or anything, which is shocking considering there being nothing else with the taco. I made due with my beans and the leftover meager serving of guac. If you're trying to mimic street tacos, that was pretty lame.
I still had too much carne asada left on my plate, they give you too much for those tiny little tortillas. 
I agree with another reviewer that said you guys oughta hire someone FROM California to cook. Have you guys actually ever eaten Mexican in SoCal? Like, not just Baja Fresh (fast food Mexican in SoCal). I think I have another review for a place in Orange, CA called Taco Adobe. Best. Mexican. Ever. Take note!
5. The server offered us complimentary coffee, which my husband accepted (I don't drink it, sorry 99% of the world). My husband asked for cream, and the server was basically like \"sorry man\". Seriously? Y'all offer free coffee without cream? I may not be a coffee drinker, but that's weird to me.
5. Music. OneRepublic was played a couple times while we were there. Nothing against them, but if you're looking for a SoCal vibe, play Sublime, Blink-182, Beach Boys or something. Look up a SoCal playlist on Spotify or Google Play music and play that. Van Morrison was playing as we left, so that was good at least. 

Look. I get this is the soft opening. I put my faith in you guys hoping my home state would be represented well in this place and ya kind of missed the mark. But, I still believe this place can be great. I will come back in a few months and I hope and pray that you take these reviews to heart!"}
{"text":"The place is pretty big and they did a great job with the look and feel of the inside. Chips and salsa was pretty good. Ordered two tacos. They were kinda small compared to other taco places, but overall love the idea of their size. I thought mine were flavored well (Steak and Pork). Steak was tender and flavorful as was the pork, but little dry. I'll give the other tacos a try next time. 

Decided to order a margarita. Great job Mr. Bartender! The drink was fantastic and he was helpful with all the options. 5-star drink! I'll be enjoying another one soon. 

Overall, the price was affordable and the quality of the food was good. If you're in the area, stop in and sit at the bar for a drink and fresh taco."}
{"text":"For some reason I was in dire need of tacos today. I live about 3 blocks away from Southbound and was hesitant to give it a try due to some poor reviews, but hey I wanted to make my own opinion. And I'm glad I did ! The service was quick and awesome and their tacos were defiantly tasty."}
{"text":"Small potions, decent flavor for the tacos, slightly over priced for what you are getting. (I was still hungry after I finished) Cabo fish taco blows this place out the water in every department. Just go there"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times prior to my visit today  and thought the food was good despite the bad reviews that were given.  I am from NC not some Tex-mex state so it was good enough for me. My visit today was exceptional, my server Ashley was wonderful as was the chef. I am currently on an odd diet given to me by my doctor so my restrictions are more than the normal \"diet\". Our server got the chef to come out and speak with me and made a custom dish for me that I could eat. They both followed up with me once it came out and I confirmed it was delicious. I really appreciate them both taking the time to make sure I had an enjoyable experience as well as made something that tasted amazing. Also, the bathrooms were so clean and smelled great. Thanks Southbound!"}
{"text":"Those tacos.. I can't even! Hit the nail on the head! Fresh and not greasy in the least. Great variety and a great environment with plenty of space!"}
{"text":"Went there today. Ordered the jicama salad, and shrimp enchiladas.  Salad had no jicama.  Could not find a shrimp on either one of the \"enchiladas\". This is NOT Mexican food I really don't know what they are trying to sell but the food was not good nor was it close to being Mexican! Expensive tasteless food. Was hungry after I left"}
{"text":"I had really been looking forward to my trip here but unfortunately, it was a let down. We arrived and had a wait which I was expecting. We made our way to the bar to get a drink while we wait. I stood there for 15 minutes and was never served. I didnt do anything against bar etiquette such as whistle or snap my fingers at the bartender, they simply never served me. One good thing was that we were seated much quicker than anticipated. We took our seats and tried ordering drinks again. We ordered our food, a few tacos, and they came out pretty fast. However, it was pretty much just taco filling thrown on top of the tiniest tortilla I've ever paid $3 for. The presentation was awful. The tacos were alright but I have definitely had better in Charlotte. Pretty bland. Not worth the money at all. We finished our food and never received our drink. We told our waiter to just cancel the drink, paid our check, and left. I know they just opened so I hope they make some changes and maybe I will come back in the future.
The only reason this has two stars instead of 1 is we were seated quickly and our food came out fast."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Margarita and service were good. Entrees and tacos very bland, and in the case of the carne asada and pork tacos, cold with little meat and little flavor. I'd pass this one by despite the cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"My wife and I popped in here on a whim and really enjoyed our experience. First off, this review was for a Tuesday night when pitchers are half off and tacos are $2. That being said, the atmosphere and space blew me away and the overall attentiveness of the staff was impressive. Certainly worth a visit IMO. I can see this place giving other South End party spots like Hot Taco a run for its money. I'm personally hoping it keeps a more chill vibe. Pricing strikes me as comparable to Vida in uptown unless you take advantage of a weeknight special. Also parking is a pain! My favorite dishes were the chicken and carne asada tacos. Free chips and salsa also help. Hope other people can find a way to enjoy Southbound like I have!"}
{"text":"Service and food were good. Beer list was \"weak\". Mexican major breweries only, no craft brews. A little disappointing considering the owners know how to put an awesome selection in place - the place next door (Macs) has GREAT beers."}
{"text":"Saturday night walked right in. All tables open. Got 4 tacos. Pretty plain. Street corn is a bit spicy for my taste but if you like spicy food I'm sure you will like it.  Lots of taquila to choose from. Beer selection was middle of the road.  Nothing special just another taco joint. Didn't love it didn't hate it. It's one of those places I'll stop in if I'm near by."}
{"text":"I left the review you see below a few months ago. I have been back a few times now and things have gone downhill. Cheese dip has a weird flavor.  The charro beans were spicy and had no flavor. Not sure how that's possible but it was. This restaurant is a true definition or \"hit or miss\". Doubt I'll be back.   4 Stars changed to 2 Stars. 

So I came in here thinking the food would be as disappointing as Macs Speed Shop (same owner) and it was actually good. I had the platos carne asada dish.  The restaurant design is neat. It wasn't real busy when we were there but the atmosphere is great too.  Chips and salsa are really good."}
{"text":"The taco shells were already ripped by the time they came. I'm not sure anything else needs to be said"}
{"text":"You can never have to many taco spots in and around town, so logically I was pretty excited when I heard about the opening of this spot in SouthEnd.  Finally had the chance to give Southbound a try after dropping my car off for service at the AAA service garage next door and taking the short walk over to Southbound.  Here's everything you need to know from the South to the Bound...

Food -  Of course they start you out with the complimentary chips and salsa - both were above par in my book.  However no trip to a Tex-Mex spot is complete unless you give the guac a whirl, and that I did.  I was actually very impressed with the guac.  The guacamole was very fresh and flavorful.   Was it all-time great?? Absolutely not, but definitely serviceable and better than guac at some other spots around town.  Since it was Tuesday, and they have tacos on special on Tuesdays, my decision was pretty much made.  I sampled three of the tacos  - the carne asada, the chicken adobo, and the baja fish.  The tacos were good, not great. I felt they could have been a little warmer (temperature wise) and baja fish wasn't that flavorful to me.  The carne asada was far and away my favorite.  The side of black beans I ordered were the perfect compliment.

Service - My server was  super friendly.  She was one of only a few people working on this slow weekday afternoon right after the holidays yet she was punctual and polite.  The food doesn't take long to come out either - both the guacamole and tacos arrived at my bar-side location within 5-min of placing my order.  

Parking - Although I walked over, it shouldn't be that much of an issue.  Southbound has its own lot and there's street parking all around.

Ambiance - I really like the SoCal, beachfront, Tex-Mex vibe that oozes from every every corner of Southbound - from the pastel colors of the chairs to the palm trees to the the naked-light bulbs draped throughout it screams chill-out.  Even during the winter season, Southbound does an excellent job of blurring inside from outside with the natural light and the big open views.  

Despite the fact that the food did not blow me away, I will def be returning.  There's a lot of items I'd like to try on the menu and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"2 stars for location and open concept. I got the shrimp enchiladas (plate comes with 2).Barely any sauce on them. Maybe 2-3 shrimp present, total. They looked flat when brought to me.  They give you tiny taster cups to hold your salsa choices. Which is useless when you get a side of chips. Total disappointment."}
{"text":"We went on a Tuesday and sat at the bar. There was no mention of Tuesday tacos, so not sure if they still do that. Bartender had no personality. We were not offered chips, also not sure if they do that. The food was fine. The bar service was terrible. We tried it and will not return, especially with Macs next door."}
{"text":"Understand new restaurant. But really,  it's lack of training. Servers have no idea what the food is. I oder the shrimp enchiladas come with no shrimp on it. I told the server about it, she said ok will bring you another one, after waiting 20 minutes and I ask I still don't have yet, she told me ok I'll take care of it unless if you want to pay and order. What?  Really?  I do not care about to paid I come to eat and willing to spend money. I guess this is not thi answer.  Sorry not coming back for this crap"}
{"text":"Highly recommend! Despite the negative reviews SouthBound was receiving when it first opened, we stopped by last night and was pleasantly surprised by how great everything was! The food, flavorful and fresh, was paired with a fun atmosphere and attentive service."}
{"text":"We had a nice lunch. Food was delicious, our server Tom was very helpful with the menu answering questions and superb service. Love the open air atmosphere gives you that beach feel. Look forward to our next visit"}
{"text":"Giving this place some leeway as it had only been open a week when I ate there - I enjoyed it! I had a Baja fish taco and muchaca beef taco on corn tortillas. They were delicious. The fish taco was my favorite as the muchaca was slightly dry but still yummy. We ordered chips and pico for the table and they were awesome! So tasty with great flavor. My friend had the carnita tacos with the charred beans. His tacos were also yummy. The beans were different than anything I had before- almost like black eyed peas but I liked them. 

We were able to bring our dog and sit in the outdoor area which is really nice and still feels like you're apart of the restaurant.

My negatives were when we walked in, no one greeted us. The person at the host stand was occupied listening to other employees fixing a problem. After staring at him and standing at the host stand for a while I asked if we could get a table. He pointed us to a different person with a macs speed shop shirt on who was very friendly. She told us we could also wait at the outdoor bar with the dog if we wanted to get a drink.

Our server was super sweet and helpful. Not the most efficient but had all the information and a great attitude."}
{"text":"After reading the original reviews of South Bound I had decided to stay away while they got on their feet. I live next door and heard that they had made a few menu changes, I decided to stop in with hopes that South Bound had improved.

The location is amazing, great atmosphere, large indoor/outdoor bar, and a large outdoor area for events. The indoor area is very spacious and decorated very well. 

In my opinion South Bound still has a ways to go before I will be back. The staff did not seem to be very organized and the overall service was sub par. It took around an hour before our server took our food orders and the food took longer than expected to come out. I ordered the shrimp bowl and it was quite large and looked good but it wasn't great. I would put it on a similar level to a Chipotle bowl.

I hope South Bound continues to improve!"}
{"text":"I was curious to try this place to see what set them apart from the millions of other taco joints around town. Overall, I'm giving it 4 stars for the great service we received from Ashley and Ray but 2 stars for the bland food. The concept is southern California style but I just don't get it. I still get a Text Mex vibe which I'm assuming is part of many people's confusion. The menu seemed to be all over the place. There wasn't anything on the menu that really screamed southern California to me. We got a bowl of the queso for the table. The queso was super thick and it didn't really have a lot of flavor. It needed some salt. The chorizo on the top was a nice add to the queso.  The harvest salsa was way too salty. We could've used the salt from the salsa in the queso. I ordered the street corn, which was pretty good. I also ordered 2 tacos: Carne asada and machaca beef. The Carne asada was great. The meat was tender and flavorful. The machaca beef didn't really have a lot of flavor to me, so it was okay. Ive had better tacos elsewhere. I also had an order of rice. The rice was really bland and didn't have any seasoning or flavor. I was expecting more from the rice like some lime and cilantro.  I also had a southbound margarita, which was delicious. It's pretty good being that it's one of the cocktails they have on tap. To top off the meal, we had an order of warm churros with chocolate and some shots. The churros and chocolate were great. I think that the location and the bangin outdoor patio are what this place has going for it. Sadly, after my visit, I'm not too keen on coming back here so quickly because of the bland food."}
{"text":"I came here expecting the worst after reading the reviews, but was very pleased with my experience! Of course the atmosphere gets a 5 star rating- we sat inside for lunch and felt like we were on vacation. We started with the Guacamole, which I thought was well seasoned (maybe could have used a little more salt). I also had two veggie tacos which were filled with a good amount of veggies and perfectly seasoned. I topped them with a little Cholula and some salsa from the salsa bar and it was the perfect amount of food for lunch time! I also had the Cantarito which is basically a sparkling grapefruit soda margarita and it was delicious!  Shout-out to our waitress Brook who was super friendly, helpful and always came around to check and see if we needed anything.  I will definitely be coming back to Southbound!"}
{"text":"This place should be called OutBound. Like get the heck outta here. Worst taco place I've had. So salty. Food came out faster than chipotle, so you know that it's just sitting in the burner back there. My street corn looks like a dried up prune. So disappointed. Was looking forward to trying this place out too."}
{"text":"Totally blown away by the airy eclectic style! Such a cool spot. Loved the unique drinks menu and our server suggested a few fun twists to the regular margaritas. Food was delicious too! I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food in a very Florida-like atmosphere..... great margaritas and sangria... yummmo -
Service was good, too"}
{"text":"This place had a ton of publicity going into it and I get the sense that the owners are well connected.  It's been packed ever since it opened.  Unfortunately, I'm sad to say that it really is not living up to the hype.

I will say it's a really cool SoCal vibe inside and the decor is spot on.  Drinks were decent --- nothing crazy but I wouldn't say bad.

Food is another story.  We got guacamole for an appetizer.  No flavor at all.  I actually wouldn't be surprised if they ran down the street to Harris Teeter or Publix and are just using their prepacked guac.

We also had the ceviche as an appetizer.  That too was totally flavorless.  And the cubes of fish couldn't have been any smaller.

As for the tacos, they were OK.  Again, kinda like the drinks, not bad but nothing too good either.  A bit on the smaller side.

Recommendation: go here for a drink or two, and then head to Mac's for dinner.  I expect the crowds to start dying out soon."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I feel about this place.. On a Sunday afternoon where it doesn't seem like it's busy. Our waiter took a very long time to get us everything. 
I ordered the 2 steaks soft tacos that I didn't care for much.. I didn't finish my drink because I asked if the bartender can surprise me and to my surprise, I couldn't figure out what it is that I'm drinking. It just taste like tequila. Nothing more. My nephews and the rest of the kids love their grilled street corns with the queso cheese that we ordered for the chips.. They couldn't care for their main dishes. My son ordered beef burrito but got beef tacos. And for the total amount of $137 on our bill. I'm not sure if it's really worth it.. maybe I'll come back without the nephews! And try again!"}
{"text":"Fresh, fun and fantastic food. I read some of the negative reviews and wondered if I was at the same restaurant.. food & service is on point! Having grown up in Southern California, the menu is exactly what I expected - the portion size to the flavor..  

The salsa is good..you can dish it up in small cups or walk your plate to the salsa bar and ladle  it on your tray/dish! The tortillas are uber fresh! I tried one of the Southbound 'Ritas (ok, two) they very good.. good balance of tequila and mix. Partially salted rim was a nice touch. 

We tried the guacamole app - very good - fresh avocados and a little onion and seasoning in there.. Chips are fresh! I'm in the less is more camp in what you throw in my guac...
We had the So_cal burrito and the Carne Asada platter too.. both large enough portions we have left overs for lunch! 

Service.. Our waiter was great - attentive and knew the menu. Manager stopped by to make sure we were happy (we were)  

We will definitely be back. Very happy to have this addition to South End!"}
{"text":"I have waited patiently to post my review hoping they could change my mind, but although quality and taste have improved I was still disappointed with the experience.  

The venue and space are amazing.  Beautiful patio and bar area, nice concert area outside.  I would love to spend more time here, but the food is still not up to par.  Food has improved since my first visit, but it is still overpriced and underwhelming.  Meats are bland, nothing is seasoned properly.  Presentation varied widely over 4 visits. Service has been up and down, but never great.  I honestly wonder why management hasn't gotten a hold on the quality of food and service with this many reviews over this length of time.  I would have given it three stars because it's not horrible, but also nothing special.  I gave it two stars because this should be an amazing restaurant considering the look and feel of the restaurant, but even the drinks are just ok and expensive.  I suggest eating somewhere else for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Below average and small tacos, service was slow. On the bright side, good beer deals and and the atmosphere was great. At the end of the day, below average food though"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch before a Panthers game.  They were open before 11a and were accommodating on getting us seated.  We were excited about trying something new. The place looks really cool, it has a great outdoor area, it was too cool to eat out the day we went.
We both ordered veggie tacos, and split a large guacamole.  They were good.  The chips and salsa were just okay, as was the guacamole.  
It was not a good as we had hoped. 
Apparently, from previous reviews, there used to be a salsa bar, that is gone now.  
We may return and give it a second chance."}
{"text":"I had heard mixed reviews when they first opened, but I am very impressed. The service was great (thanks Madison!), and the food was delicious. I had three different tacos and the street corn. They didn't stand a chance. I devoured it all and almost bit my finger off in the process. I can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is good- fun decor, especially for the comfortable fall weather in CLT. No TV's, even at the bar, so if you want to watch football, be sure to go next door to Macs. The food was underwhelming. My shrimp enchilada only had one shrimp in it. Menu was nothing to write home about. The service was slow but the servers were nice and gave us a free drink because they ran out of the drink that my husband wanted."}
{"text":"The stars are for the setting- it's fun and chill. The service was awful- never brought food that we asked for 4 times, didn't take it off the bill after never coming, had to flag down other waitresses for water. The food was blah. Not much taste at all - I get \"simple\" but this was flavorless.  Drinks seemed weak. There's just a lot better options for this sort of setting and food. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Just awful in every way. Most notably though for the new live music they have every Saturday night (for 5 straight hours) that cannot be ignored as a nearby resident. The sounds from inside my home are no different than if I was standing center stage. My hope is that enough people complain about having to endure this that they're forced to put a stop to these concerts. I also can't imagine it's a strong selling point when buying or leasing new property that the option to stay home and have a quiet Saturday night will not be afforded to them in this area."}
{"text":"I was very hesitant to give this place a try after so many fellow Yelpers had such a poor experience but I wanted to see what the fuss was about so my fiancé and I went last night.

We walked in and the hostess' told us they were on a wait, even though there were open tables. Trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, maybe they weren't fully staffed or something. I went to grab a drink at the bar. I got a cocktail that was tequila and grapefruit with several other citrus juices. I watched the bartender make it and wow half an ounce of liquor for a $10 drink. The drink would have been great if it had normal amounts of tequila in it. 

After waiting 30 mins when we were told 20 mins I went and asked the hostess if we could sit at one of the 20 empty seats out. She had an attitude but said ok. We sat down and Ashley greeted us. Ashley was a breathe of fresh air because she really took the time to explain the tiny little menu. 

We ordered a street corn, 3 different tacos and the burrito. The street corn was super yum but not sure that really could be messed up. The burrito was strange... French fries inside of it seem like a filler because it lacked a lot of flavor. 2 out of the 3 tacos we got were good. We were not a fan of the chicken mole, it wasn't spicy at all. The beef and shrimp were tasty. The taco are small, about 3 bites. 

Now they seems to be pretty proud of the salsa bar but I have no clue why. It looked sad and depressing. They need to work on the presentation of the very empty ice wells. Also the tiny little cups they give with the giant ladle doesn't really work. I wouldn't really call the bar a salsa bar because it really only had two salsas it's more like sauces. The creamy chipotle was my favorite.

I think it's very strange that the menu is so small and that they don't offer toppings like jalapeños or sour cream. You def should carry those items if you are going to serve tacos. 

We finished up our meal by trying the churros which were ok but much better without the chocolate sauce because I'm pretty sure it was plain Hershey syrup. 

Overall they have a lot they can improve on and they might be busy right now because it's a new place but that will die off. They need to step up there game. In my opinion it feels like they spent all their money in decor and atmosphere and put nothing into the menu. It lacks passion and deep flavors. I hope to see them regroup and make some changes from all the feedback so that this could be a place that sticks around!"}
{"text":"Our experience with Southbound was a let down. First off the ambiance is amazing, this place seriously looks legit! Upon sitting down we asked the server if they had any cheese dip. The server said No. what I don't get about restauranteurs who open Mexican/taco places and don't have cheese dip. Like even Chipotle caught on after their stock price tanked. Everyone loves queso, this is a fact. 

The menu has zero description of what each taco is and what's on it. So you have to ask and if you have a server that's not up to speed you're literally rolling the dice as to what you're going to get.

Salsa, they only have pico that you can order for salsa. They have a makeshift salsa bar but it's not for chips, it's for your tacos. And they give you these small white containers like the ones you put ketchup in fast food restaurants. They are literally hoarding this stuff like it's gold. At least have it to where you can order it on the menu. This is what people normally get at Mexican restaurants it's a given. Chips and Salsa, cheese dip, it's how America does Mexican. 

Before we even got our food our server laid down the bill. It was not our bill and we didn't ask for it. 5 mins later the server asked if I was ready to pay. I hadn't even got my food yet! Service took so long to get us our food, finally we asked and they said it had been delivered to the wrong table. They comped our bill which was nice but the manager never came over to ask us anything! They've got a leadership problem here. I never saw one manager go around to any of the tables and mingle with any of the guests. 

Who starts a taco place and tries to limit the amount of salsa you can consume? It's like they said the people want cheese dip so definitely don't do that and let's limit their salsa consumption. Can't have them eating all the salsa.  It's definitely a cost cutting thing and it shows 

Good: Ambiance 

Bad: No description on Menu for food items, Uninformed Servers, Salsa bar is as stingy as your rich uncle, No leadership, glasses are so small you need a refill every 45 seconds."}
{"text":"I've wondered about this place and I've been wanting to try it. So, on a whim and as I was leaving Long's animal Hospital, I stopped. Iordered two tacos, one Baja shrimp, one Baja fish and a side of refried black beans. Both the shrimp and the fish were heavily breaded and deep-fried to the point that they were tasteless and crunchy. The slaw and sauces lacked flavor. I opted for the corn tortillas, which were dry and hard around the edges. I will say the black beans were the best part, as they did have a nice flavor. However, you could actually drink them they were so thin!  Fast food in a nice open concept space with a good vibe. Sadly, terrible food."}
{"text":"Haven't had anything bad here. Patio is nice. Staff is friendly. All girl bartenders (not complaining). People bring there dogs outside. Prices might drive some people away. I pay for good food, good atmosphere, good people watching, and customer service. This place gets 4 stars from me. Street corn was good, nachos ok, and tacos good. Had the strawberry basil lavender mule."}
{"text":"Considering the bad press around this place when it first opened, I feel compelled to write this review. We had a group of 18 people there for a birthday dinner (on a Taco Tuesday nonetheless) and the service was awesome. It is not easy to host that many people and the servers and management did an awesome job, kept our drinks filled and were very accommodating. Their chips and salsa may be my favorite in CLT and the food was much better than I expected based on what I had heard. I was very much pleasantly surprised and will be back again."}
{"text":"I'm deducting one star because of the parking lot. The spots are so narrow that when busy there are approximately two vehicles for every three parking spots. 

I'm deducting one star because of the hostess working Saturday 1/13/2018. When I mentioned the terrible parking lot she sort of chuckled and said that they see the problem all the time. After  recommended to her that they consider decreasing the parking spots to allow more vehicles, she replied \"I'm just the hostess\". Not the type of customer service I expect from a higher end restaurant. She should have at least humored me by saying she'd let the manager know. 

The food was really good. Price on point for the restaurant.

They offer some cocktails by the pitcher. Enough to share with about six people. 

The building appears to be an old auto shop. The windows are single pane glass. Sitting by the window while it was about 32 degrees outside was chilly. 

Looks like there is a large room in the back for group parties. 

I would go again as long as the parking lot is half empty or I ride my motorcycle."}
{"text":"South Bound is a great example of Southern California Cuisine.  Their Cevichie is very fresh and tasty. I wish I had gotten the larger order because it was that good! I enjoyed their margaritas and they were well prepared. The pico de gallo was the best I have ever eaten.  The tacos were well prepared and I can't wait to go back and try more.  Charlotte needed a SoCal eatery and I think we have a great one now."}
{"text":"The location is great. The building and atmosphere is great. The service was pretty good, though the waiter definitely didn't know the menu. 

The food was really bland- fresh ingredients but honestly not much flavor. I got 4 tacos; fish, shrimp, chicken, pork. None memorable and I was pretty disappointed - I wouldn't order any of them again. The street corn is excellent."}
{"text":"Y'all - go here!! Great so cal food reasonably priced with great service. I was hesitant to try my first time due to all the negative reviews I saw but then decided to go anyway. I was not disappointed! The Macacha beef tacos and brunch scramble are to die for!! They bring you chips and delicious salsa gratis and a nice fresh cold bottle of water for the table. No waiting for a server to refill your water! And the servers are amazing! Donovan went above and beyond to take care of me and my mom. She didn't want anything too spicy so he went to check with a few other servers to make sure anything he recommended wasn't too spicy. She loved the California burrito! And brunch is the perfect time for kids to tag along. Leaving here now and I see tons of families enjoying their Saturday. You won't be disappointed here!!"}
{"text":"Great spot. I was able to grab a quick and delicious lunch. The chicken tamales were excellent. Brooke took fantastic care of me. Definitely will become part of the regular rotation."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Friday night. It wasn't very busy at all. At least half of the restaurant was empty. When we went to the hostess booth the lady had no idea how to seat us. We were just two people. We were finally seated and waited ten minutes. Not one staff member came to greet us or take our drink order. Service was just terrible. I can't speak about the food because nobody showed up to take our order. We ended up having to walk out."}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance.  I love what they did with that old building.  Looks like they went to great expense on that glass and steel hangar door and the pivoting windows over the bar.   Service was ok and I can certainly understand the first few days there being room for improvement.  My biggest disappointment was really the food.  The ceviche was basically Pico de Gallo with tiny little pieces of fish and not much of it.  Guacamole was ok but nothing to write home about.  The in-house made flour taco shells were really the best part of the tacos.  If they could fill them like they do at Mac's using Southbound in-house wraps I think they'd be great!

No TV's definitely a plus.

I think I still prefer Mac's over Southbound."}
{"text":"I need to update my review. Maybe I got lucky the first time here but ever since it's been a miss. Management really needs to improve their staff's service for large groups. I don't think they know how to function when you have a table of 4 or more. They ALWAYS seem to mess up the taco orders. I think the only time they didn't mess it up was when it was only my husband and I. Regardless I don't understand why it's so difficult. They need to fix their service issues ASAP or I might not be coming back. 

The food is always hit or miss. I can't really tell a difference between their taco toppings. They all seem the same to me. Nothing stands out to make them different. 

They also took away the margarita specials which is a total bummer... hopefully they will bring them back. 

Overall SouthBound is average. It wouldn't be my first choice for Mexican, but I do enjoy the open environment and the patio. Plus their chips and salsa is pretty decent."}
{"text":"After 3 visits, we love Southbound! We have visited both during the week and on the weekend and each trip have been equally great. We sit at the bar and receive excellent service! Each bartender is super helpful and friendly. 

Contrary to other reviews the tacos have lots of flavor. We have had almost every taco and haven't had a bad one yet. We usually get the corn taco, but tried the flour and love that too. Our favorite is definitely the Baja Fish taco! I get a side of guac with my  and it's pretty standard. We tried the draft margarita and was pleasantly surprised. 

Although the salsa bar cups could be better, it doesn't really matter because your pouring the salsa on your taco anyway. At the end of the day, we love being able to taste different salsa flavors! 

The atmosphere and open concept is awesome! Southend was in need of another place to grab a quick bite to eat but also provide that nice dining experience. We will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"The two stars are for atmosphere alone. 
The tacos are Tiny and way too expensive and to be honest not that good. The flavor was fine but nothing great. All you get is a taco. No sides no garnish. Chips and salsa are expensive at 8$ for one big enough for two people and a handful of chips. 
Not worth the drive down south blvd."}
{"text":"What wonderful food and service!!  Has the Baja fish tacos and they were super fresh!!  Thanks James for all of your help!!!  Absolutely wonderful!!!"}
{"text":"First time at this fun restaurant. My husband travels to Southern Mexico and really enjoyed the sweet corn. So happy there is no Tilapia in the fish Taco. Will call this a Charlotte favorite"}
{"text":"On a whim we decided to give Southbound a try. It was a lovely Thursday afternoon and the outdoor seating called to us. The seating choice were either high top tables with stools or picnic tables - neither with backs.  While we appreciated the austere setting we would have liked to see a more comfortable seating option.  We waited at our table after being immediately sat by a bubbly hostess and advised they were not only busy but very short staffed.  We waited about 10 minutes and the manager came over to take our drinks and lunch order.  We ordered sodas and chips with guacamole which were okay.  
We decided to do tacos and each ordered 3 types each.  My husband ordered the one of each beef, pork and chicken.  The beef taco was very good but the other two were very bland tasting.  I ordered yellowfin tuna (which tasted like an old shoe), shrimp and fish Baja tacos.  They were meh.  
We honestly thought it was a chain restaurant with how basic the food was.  
The service was good and our server was very apologetic for the wait.  
With all the options around that area we won't be going back anytime soon - because it was not at all worth the $60 we spent."}
{"text":"Y'all are crazy critical. I hadn't even heard of this place before my partner whipped me up into the parking lot after a workday from hell. First, the decor is super cute. 

We were greeted warmly and seated immediately. Everyone we encountered including our waitress had really high energy and were eager to assist with recommendations. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the culture of the place and complimented our selections. 

The food: I ordered the SoCal Burrito-THE BOMB and the beans and pico were a great compliment. We also had two orders of Street Corn because hungry. My partner ordered the Baja Fish Tacos and the Camarón which were both perfectly seasoned and bursting with flavor. 

The drinks: originally we ordered Sangria but it was kinda weak so our waitress happily changed them to margaritas and trust me, you will not be disappointed! I barely finished mine and I was tipsy and I drink!

I took away a star because our waitress did disappear for just long enough for us to wonder where she went but she came back so lol. 

Sorry fellow Yelpers-idk what happened but my experience was great! I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times now because I absolutely love their patio seating. The menu is a pretty cool twist on mexican food. Their drinks are unique and good too. It's easy to find and located right on South Blvd. There's plenty of parking and we've never had to wait for a table. The patio is also dog friendly (bonus!). The service has been hit or miss to be honest. You can tell they are a newer business and things are a little unorganized. They do try though!

The menu prices are a little high, in my opinion, for the quality of food. It's decent, not the best, not the worst I've ever had. I'll definitely come back in the future but it wouldn't be my first choice. Hopefully things run a little smoother the longer they're open!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place after reading the reviews for the past couple of months. I am soooooooooo glad I gave this place a try. From the moment we walked in it was a pleasant experience. Our waiter, Donovan, greeted us immediately with a smile and 2 glasses of water. Soon there after we received complimentary chips and salsa that were excellent. I like the fact it came with 2 different bowls so each of us had our own to dip in. They even have some salsas on the table that I added to mine (it made it a little more spicy). I had a beer (only $4 for an IPA) and my girlfriend had the house margarita and both were great. As for entrees, I had the carne asada quesadilla and she had the Baja fish burrito. Both were EXCELLENT!! The food came no more than 10 minutes after we ordered. We asked for more chips and salsa before our meal and they brought it out immediately. I could not be happier with our experience here and will definitely be back. Please give this place a try. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing service! Kerry was our bar tender and was super friendly, attentive and had great menu suggestions. Also, the manager (guy in his 30s with gelled hair) brought us more chips when he realized we were out and continued to make sure we were pleased with the food and drinks. Atmosphere was really fun and had a great vibe. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed the food on tonight and the waitress customer service was so professional for my first being here
 I felt very comfortable and I loved Amanda whom was our waitress for tonight. She went all out the on recommendations and service. 

Thank you so much I was pleased and treated like a queen. Lol"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, Awesome customer service . 
Ordered salad  with grill chicken and it was tasteless. The chicken wasn't grilled and it was the boiled chicken that is used in tacos. 
The Pico de Gallo was also tasteless ( all they need to add is more lime  and cilantro) 
Would I go back again ? maybe ( sit at bar and have chips and beer ) but because of great customer service I might try it again.  Thanks to the manager for acknowledging the problem. 
Is a new business so hopefully the kitchen would spice up the food ( is Mexican food spice it up )"}
{"text":"The food is good, but not at the price point.  I would prefer to dine at Bakersfield for similar options and better pricing.  I do enjoy the open air atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went in on a Saturday night & they were jumpin! Tyler was our server, he was awesome especially considering how busy he was!! Food was bomb, definitely go for the fish tacos. Sangria by the pitcher ?! Can I get an AMEN?!?! 

Anyways , 10/10 would recommend 

Ps saw some extremely rude customers give the hostess a hard time, & she handled it like a champ. Future customers, if you go anywhere at prime-dinner-time on a Saturday night, expect to wait a couple minutes. No need to take it out on the poor staff who are just trying to do their jobs!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to visit based on what I heard about the place, that was a mistake. On a hot Sunday afternoon my entire perception changed. The patio is open and allows a nice breeze through that kept us cool, the margaritas did the rest. Chips and salsa were delivered to the table as soon as we sat down. The salsa was different but very good, as were the chips. We ordered the guacamole and again, another pleasant surprise, not overpowered by any one flavor but really let the avocado shine. The California burrito is what will bring me back however. Several years ago I enjoyed a burrito in SF that made every burrito since only subpar, until this one. Steak, pico, guac, fries, nothing else. I'm not sure why more restaurants don't incorporate fries into their burritos but it's a game changer. The refried beans on the side were a nice compliment as well, again keeping with the fresh theme allowing the natural flavor to shine as opposed to overpowering with seasoning. Overall Southbound was very very good, I'll save the Sabor comparison."}
{"text":"Starting with Pros:
5-Ambience and decor. I love the rustic, industrial vibe. The tables are shared tables which I'm sure is to create conversations amongst other patrons-great concept since we're in the South. It wasn't crowded when I got there so of course the girl next to me was using the open seat btw us for her 20lb purse.  

5-manager (the bald blue eye guy bashed in another review). He has already shaped up 1 day later, he was really great. Walked around to check in and take care of patrons (will bring him up later in the negatives). Seems like he cares about getting this plane in shape, so definitely bring the issue up with him before you're entire experience is ruined. I'm all for giving this place a chance to fix things. 

5-Chips-just the chips. Not too greasy, good size and consistency for dips.

4-Waitress-Seems with these reviews they are actually trying to learn the menu. She did explain concept, salsa bar and tried to act like she knew the menu. She was peppy and attentive. No issues with food delivery time (again it wasn't that busy). They had lots of staff so I think they are prepping for a lunch rush since it's Saturday. 
5-Mexican beer-they have Sol!

3-Salsa effort. I am a salsa snob as its my favorite food. I can't say I fell in love with any, but I appreciated it. I know you are supposed to flavor your own taco with your fav, but I just didn't have one. Reminded me of Baja Fresh-the SoCal fast food taco spot. 

Then we start to slip... Cons:
Food: 
2-Guac is literally mashed up avocados. No flavor, no tomatoes, gross. We added pepper immediately, but it didn't help. 

1-Ceviche (market price=$20) and even when the food runner brought it, she said \"pico.\" The flavor of pico was great-but it was actually supposed to be ceviche. I brought it up to the waitress and she just asked if I wanted another. With reluctance, I didn't want a second bowl of pico, but I said sure hoping for the best. The Mgr remedied it and said he'd comp it. But guess what, the waitress put 2 on the bill!! What?! Have you ever worked in a restaurant? If someone complains about a dish and you bring another out you NEVER charge for 2!

1-Price. Ouch. If you want to serve street tacos, great, but charge for street tacos. They should be like 3-$5 or $2 each-tops. Street tacos are traditionally around $1.50-2, even in CA. 

2-Tacos had way too much garnish and hardly any meat. The ratio was so off they tasted like stale cabbage. We tried pastor and carne asada-bad choices. 

2-Heavy set woman as the greeter. We got there after the gym and realized neither of us brought our wallets. Oops. So I went in to see if they took Apple Pay so we didn't have to head home. After having to actually greet them and say hi, she finally acknowledged me. When I asked about Apple Pay she looked at me like I spoke Greek and said \"I don't think so...I don't work here, I'm just helping, but I don't think so.\" Of course I just stood there waiting for her to actually ask someone that does work there. All the other girls were just staring at me like that scene with the Minion's in the toy machine starting at the claw. She then walked over to ask someone and said no. Thanks for all that work you did to find out if I could pay to eat at this restaurant. Why does no one know what that is? Maybe having your friend help by being the greeter isn't a good idea if they aren't friendly, helpful, or knowledgable-just a thought. Should've taken it as a sign, but we went home and got the card and returned. 

2-Roller derby staff is the final con. While my bf walked to the bathroom 3 separate girls were walking in the same path, and during the chicken match, determined they had the right of way so he had to scoot over. We then observed for a bit and saw they do it with all the patrons. It's odd to see bc in no other restaurant does the staff act like you're in the way bc they are working and you're just there. 

3-logistics. No one knows what any table numbers are. I get it - you're new, but make a freakin table chart and require everyone memorize it, not rocket science. Other restaurants require staff to know 10 page menus-it can be done. If you look around the restaurant is full of staff with food trays turning in circles and dripping things as the wrong table. 

All in all I would probably not come back. If this place makes it 6 months I might try then, as hopefully they will have shaped up. I appreciate the fresh ingredients, location and the ambiance, they just have so many cons to work through."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and love the food.  I would be here more often except I don't live near Charlotte.  I hope to be back soon though.  The flavors are very good, good selections.  I like everything about this place."}
{"text":"Was in with a few girlfriends over the weekend, let me start with; from the moment our server ,Ray, came over it was on!!  He was exceptional from beginning to end! Knowledgeable about their food and drink options, but I honestly ended up ordering carne asada tacos because he assured me his girlfriend loved them. He didn't fail me! They were delicious!! Steak cooked beautifully and fresh pico... so what more could I ask for? The perfect margarita...that he went and made himself! Never have I ever had a server work so hard and be so good at their job. Thanks Ray for the fantastic experience!!"}
{"text":"I have heard the good, the bad, and the ugly about Southbound... well maybe not ugly, but definitely the good and the bad. From what I know they had a rocky start, but I went with a co-worker last Friday and our server informed us that they had overhauled and broadened the menu with more tacos, burritos, quesadillas, and salads. 

Kicked off of course with the chips and salsa, good spice, not overwhelming. Chips were great. Typical. For lunch I went with the California burrito - carne asada, guac, pico, cheese, and... french fries (and a side of refried black beans)! It was a healthy-sized burrito and packed to the gills with goodness. Meat was perfectly cooked and there were enough fries for you to know that they were there, but not enough to make you feel like you were eating a Happy Meal south of the border. They also have a DELICIOUS smoky hot sauce. The flavor was how I would imagine a spicy campfire on a beach in Cabo San Lucas would taste like - without the Corona.

If Southbound was as bad as early reviews seemed, they have definitely turned it around. Worth a shot if you're craving Mexican without the mariachi band."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place! The taco Tuesday special is $2 tacos which are a great deal! They have a wonderful bar menu as well. The fish tacos are my fav! Their street corn is always really really yummy! The bar tenders and staff are very friendly. Their chips and salsa are free with every meal and super yummy!! I think their menu could use a little more work but overall I really think it's a great place to hang!"}
{"text":"Non descriptive menu, bad guacamole, and overpriced tacos in an awesome atmosphere with good service."}
{"text":"Went here today with some co-workers. All of us enjoyed our meals and loved the atmosphere. My friends got a variety of tacos and I got the so-cal burrito. We loved the different salsas that were offered at the salsa bar too! None of us left disappointed! I was worried about coming here at first because of the reviews but it is such a convenient spot in south end by our job so we had to try it! We will definitely be back! I can't wait until it cools down and we can enjoy tacos and drinks after work because they have a great outdoor space!"}
{"text":"Ohh Southbound, how you have captured my heart! 

Southend is not usually my jam on a Friday night, but this was worth it. This place reminds me of good times in LA and has me thinking I'm due for a visit. Southbound has got me feeling all West Coast bound over here. 

Not one smile-less server in the place. Friendly faces moving at brisk paces. Lots of open space to move around freely and practice your runway walk to the bar. 

Overall, great experience. Not sure how this will work once the temperature drops, but for now, it's a hit."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come here since it opened but had stayed away based on reviews and to give them time to work out \"new restaurant kinks\". Stopped on Saturday afternoon while out running errands. It was not busy at all so I grabbed a seat at the bar. I was quickly greeted by the bartender. I ordered a beer and guacamole and chips. They came out within a few minutes. The chips were warm but missing enough salt. The guacamole was good, with small chunks of avocado. I prefer mine to have a bit more zip from jalapeño. 
I ordered the Baja fish and the carnitas tacos. You have a choice of flour or corn tortillas. They also came out fast. Baja Fish taco had good flavor, with the pieces of fish being very lightly breaded. The Carnitas taco, also had good flavor but it consisted of one very large chunk of meat. That made it very hard to eat. They have a salsa bar with five or six different salsas you can choose from. They offer small soufflé cups to put them in, and a little metal tray to carry them back to your table on. I see they have made several adjustments since all of the reviews from when they first opened. To include menu item descriptions and also the little metal trays at the salsa bar.
The atmosphere at Southbound is very cool. Very open concept with a huge outside patio and open garage doors at the inside bar. When you first walk in the main entrance, there is a taco window. Not really sure what that's all about but I think you could order food to go from there. I will definitely go back and try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Waiter was friendly and nice. Knew what he was talking about. Didn't have a wait during the day on a Saturday but ordered my food and it took a long time to receive 3 tacos. They discounted the tacos. The tacos : shrimp, chicken, and steak, weren't that great. Might need to add more flavor to them, switch it up a little. The salsas need more texture to them. Overall decent place. Would come back, hopefully they upgrade their tacos."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at SouthBound is is great. Big, open, airy dining room. A lot of sunlight, especially with the patio doors open. I'd be content hanging out here if the food wasn't so bad.

Started with queso. Not good. It had a pasty texture. Looked, felt, and tasted more like hummus than cheese. This may be the style elsewhere but it's not what I expected and I did not care for it at all. Asked for salsa and they didn't have it....at a Mexican restaurant.

Fiancé had a burrito. It had French fries wrapped inside and was completely bland. I don't even know how else to describe it because it had no flavor at all. She did not like it either. I had the carnitas. Probably the only somewhat decent thing all day. Edible but underwhelming. 

Had sangria. Watered down and flavorless. They sprinkle cinnamon on top. It's basically cinnamon water. Also had one tiny slice of pineapple. Do not recommend.

Service was fine. But we did have food brought to us by servers other than our own on 3 or 4 separate occasions asking if we ordered it when we hadn't. They need to work on that.

Long story short. Good atmosphere. Menu is strictly Mexican food, no other options. The food is flavorless. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"The ambience is super cool and they have a kick ass giant front porch. But the margaritas nor the food are all that great. I've heard this from multiple people as well so it wasn't just my visits. It's a shame, because the restaurant itself is so cool."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review bc MAN - tough crowd up in yelp and not taking advice from anyone that doesn't even know what a camaron is!

First, the atmosphere and interiors are great - I love that there is space to eat and bring your dog. Also, cool outdoor tables for drinking - plus if there is a long wait you can order food from the bar and it shows up 5 minutes later. 

Southbound is not Tex- mex - not going to be covered with beans, cheese, and sliced iceberg lettuce ( this ain't chilis); it's so- cal so it's going to have limited ingredients. I had the carnitas, mole and veg tacos and enjoyed all. I agree that the guac would be better if it wasn't pre made and salsa bar could improve (mango salsa anyone?) Didn't try the drinks but will be back for that. All the bartenders ( who were killing them selves) - it was their first night so I think with time it'll improve but service was great!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome Southern California street food at its best sooooo much better than Tex-mex and the tequila selection is out of this world"}
{"text":"In those infamous words, \"Not too good\".  Our server had a long greet time and truly just seemed out of it.  Did not ask for a drink order, simply dropped off water and asked if we were ready to order.  I ordered a Michelada, which was delivered 10 minutes later.  It was nothing like any Michelada I have ever had, very little lime or clamato.  We ordered a couple tacos each, both different.  However, when our food was delivered, they had simply made the duplicate order.  It took 5 minutes to get a hostess to ask a manager to come by and correct the issue, we did not see our server the entire time.  The manager did correct the issue with the right food.  My wife was done eating well before my food arrived.  The entire staff seemed lethargic and unhappy to be there.  I watched four staff members walk by a napkin on the floor, actually going out of the way to avoid stepping on it but not pick it up.  To manage is to direct and control, which was simply not happening.  The food was ok, portion size of protien was lacking.  Most likely will not repeat when so many better options available."}
{"text":"The only thing about SouthBound that'll blow you away is the atmosphere - super laid back, open air, murals, comfy patio, etc. My friend and I got there right after work on a Tuesday, and by the time we left, it was standing room only.

We started with chips and pico (since we read so many negative reviews of the guac) for $5. The pico came in a huge bowl and was less than half full. And the chips (which you pay for) aren't any better than the free ones you get at every other Mexican restaurant. My sangria was $7 for 8 ounces, half of which was water, and my friend's draft beer came in a tiny 8 oz glass. We got the salsas off the salsa bar to try with our chips, and I gotta be honest - I didn't care for any of them, and there were 6.

For dinner, we each got 2 tacos - I got al pastor and carne asada, and she got camaron (shrimp) and adobo. They weren't as small as we expected, but they also didn't have a ton of flavor. It would also be helpful if the menu explained the items a little more so we didn't have to Google \"camaron\" while we sat there. 

Our waiter was great in the beginning, but as it got busier, he disappeared. He also made a little too much conversation with us, telling us how staff had quit, how his tips had been, etc. A fly landed in our water bottle, and when he noticed, he took it away... but never brought another bottle back.

Overall, people are gonna come here for the atmosphere, but for tasty food and great drinks, Paco's wins hands down."}
{"text":"A friend and I came to SouthBound after hearing that a new SoCal Mexican Street food restaurant had opened in hip Southend. 
Positives: the restaurant's decor is cute and inspired and the patio is wonderful with the open air concept. Really great for a nice day. 
Negatives: although the the food came out fast...it was almost TOO fast. Like did we get someone else's order or were the ingredients made this morning and been sitting in a warmer waiting for some unsuspecting diner to order?? Our waitress was relatively attentive at first but after receiving our order she all but disappeared. We saw her helping other tables but she never came back to us. For context, my friend even had to get up and go ask the manger for a refill on her drink and I had to settle our bill with some random waitress that happened to walk by our table!! There was a table of diners who had chosen to bring their dog with them to the restaurant to eat on the patio (that's a whole separate issue), and our waiter as well as the hostess thought it appropriate to pet and touch the dog. Soooo...that's disgusting! You're handling food, menus, drinks etc. no bueno! And even if there is a slim chance that you went to the back and washed your hands (that didn't happen I'm sure), the optics are that all the diners just saw you petting an animal and then go right back to serving food!!! That HAS TO violate some sort of health code statute. Lastly the food was edible (it wasn't gross) but it was flavorless and bland at best. Definitely nothing to write home about and definitely not compelling enough to warrant a second visit. 
All and all, on a nice day, the patio would be sufficient to grab drinks and chips & dip with friends...don't both with the food. That is, unless the waitress' are playing with animals that day and in that case I'd just recommend avoiding the place altogether."}
{"text":"Born and raised in San Diego.  This place hits the mark for Taco Shop style Mexican Food.  Also, just about every Mexican Beer you could every want. I will be back...and often."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night. My friend and I must have waited 20-30 minutes for the waiter to come take our food order.

I'm a huge connoisseur of margaritas, and I'm not sure if I got a bad one, but the margarita i got tasted like a cup of lime juice--that's it.

The prices were steep for what was delivered. My friend and I never ordered food because after 45 min we weren't even asked for food orders. 

I really wanted this place to be better than it was--"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times (I live across the street so it's a convenience thing) and it has been consistently mediocre. I'm writing this review because a friend and I walked in at 9:45 and were turned away for dinner even though they close at 11:00. The hostess was a little spacey, which is fine but the manager (a thin guy in his 30s) was rude and matter of fact that they wouldn't be serving us. We went next door to mac's and were treated much better."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite restaurant and night spot. Food is awesome and service is amazing!  Great portion food, we all got something different and it was the best. Server explained the menu in detail and the drinks were wonderful!"}
{"text":"Given, I went the first week it opened, but the food wasn't anything special. The best thing I had was the guacamole. It has a really fun atmosphere and the drink menu was great, but again, the food left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday night it was pretty empty so we were immediately seated - that was the good. 

We ordered the guacamole. I'm not sure how guacamole has no flavor... and I mean none! It was really bizarre. It was missing seasoning... salt at a minimum. I ended up adding some at the table.

I ordered tacos. I was sad that the only fish taco they had was fried. They consider themselves the California fresh taco shop... I'm shocked that there was no grilled fish taco with that in mind. The chicken taco was ok, nothing mind blowing. 

The decor and atmosphere are really nice. The outdoor space is really cool and the cocktails looked awesome so maybe I'll give them another shot for a happy hour."}
{"text":"Went here the first week of their grand opening and hated the menu.. just came back and it's my new favorite spot! Can't wait for summer and the doors to open.. thank you Donoven for being an awesome server!"}
{"text":"I really hate to do this, because I really want to like this place! Service was five star, prices were five star (especially the cocktails; $7 El Jimador shots) but the food was just meh. Chips and salsa; hot just enough salt and salsa was great . I did order the queso fundido with chorizo ($7) not worth the price due to portion size and flavor- it tasted like velveeta and that over powered whatever chorizo there was in there. I had the veggie quesadilla ($8 if I remember correctly) the mushrooms over powered whatever else was in there, but the charro beans on the side were pretty tasty. Taco plates give you the biggest bang for your buck; 2 for $7 or 3 for $10 with beans and rice (combo in a cup, kind of weird served together , beans topped with rice in a cup) the tacos arrived cold and should be piping hot. Had to send both plates back. They really concentrate on the taco topping , which just really needs to be simple to be street taco and these have a lot of \"stuff\". I will be willing to try again as the restaurant is simple with a cool CA vibe and easy on the wallet."}
{"text":"I'm In. I will keep coming back. Closest taste to home I've had since we moved to this side of the country from SD. It has been two months; so my food memory is pretty fresh. 
Nothing beats a home made tortilla. Portions and price are fine.  Food portions on this part of the country are too large!! The pieces of crap I've tasted in other restaurants in Charlotte labeled as tacos allow these lil jewels to have their price. Did I mention that The tortillas are MADE IN HOUSE?  please quit complaining about the cost. 
The ceviche has the right ingredients and flavor. Ours was too salty so please watch out for that. 
Salsa bar? Well yes please and thank you!!
Margaritas need improvement. 
Our server was great."}
{"text":"SouthBound is very attractive driving by and you see the big patio area with cozy lighting. Before my first visit, I read an article that highlighted many visitors' dislike of this restaurant mainly due to failed expectations on many levels. The chef responded and held his ground by reiterating the concept of what the restaurant is. Simple, fresh, and tasty tacos!

Service was a bit slow and they were out of stock on the mango Jarritos both times I've been but I think it was due to growing pains and the \"new\" rush. I will be back because the atmosphere is great and the food is very fresh.

Tip: If really busy, find parking in the back or go into the paved parking lot instead of the gravel lot. Avoid going into the gravel lot if full because there is no outlet to turn around. We had to back out onto busy SouthEnd."}
{"text":"The have a great outdoor patio reminds me of restaurants in LA. The weather was 70 and I sat outside at the outdoor bar. Had the SouthBound margarita and which went well with the complimentary chips and salsa. 
My bartender was Devin not only was she easy on the eye but she make a great margarita! 
I had the Baja shrimp tacos that come either grilled or fried! I got them grilled and they were seasoned well and not over grilled. The tacos come come with Napa cabbage that's tossed in lime juice and olive oil and the Baja taco came with a jalapeño cream pico de Gallo sauce. 
They have alive music and and vendors on Saturdays starting at 6pm. They also have 2 dollar taco Tuesdays that I defiantly be back to try!"}
{"text":"I think that this place is okay. The restaurant is walking distance from where I live so I end up there a lot purely based on its location. They have an awesome patio and good Taco Tuesday specials. They have free chips and salsa and the tacos are very average. I've tried them all and the steak one is the best. I have also been here for brunch and think that this is where they excel more than dinner.  There are better upscale Mexican places in Charlotte and I would suggest Babalu or Cantina 1511 over SouthBound."}
{"text":"Tacos were good. Didn't get the ones I ordered but they were good. Servers had to squint and stare at the tacos to try and figure out what's what. Still got it wrong. Service in general was bad but I'm figuring that will be fixed. 
Guac was probably one of the worst I've had.Tasted like one of those fake guacs that's mixed with peas. 

I got 2 southbound margaritas and for almost 10 dollars each I didn't expect sour mix margs. Horrible. Pure sugar and no tequila. 

Ambiance was good."}
{"text":"Decided to give them a try and was deeply disappointed. It started with the lack of service from the hostess. We walked in and asked for a table of six, without saying anything she walked away with a frown on her face and walked to a booth. We got the clue and walked over. There was six of us and she put us at a booth that could barely fit four. When we asked for a table she walked us to a table and acted mad. We ordered chips and guacamole which was disappointing to say the least. It tasted like it came out of a bag. Returned it. The tacos were either bland or super salty. They have a weird sauce bar by the kitchen with cheap tiny fast food cups (the kind you pour ketchup into) that get very messy when you try to use for salsas. Overall a huge let down. Save yourself some trouble and go to Bakersfield down the street."}
{"text":"When we visited SouthBound it was a very slow and quiet Monday night. We loved the burritos and quesadillas as well as the sangria and beer specials. Everything was great other than the queso, which was just short of awful. But I will definitely be visiting again, especially now that I know about taco Tuesday with half priced pitchers."}
{"text":"My tacos needed some seasoning. The corn on the cob was mushy...not al dente. The margarita was good but small. The atmosphere was great....loved the outdoor feel. Will not be back if food does not improve."}
{"text":"This place serves salsa in a paper tiny to go ramekin for peasants . A disgrace."}
{"text":"Food is incredibly bland.  I had the carne asada and it was low quality steak with no seasonings whatsoever, 2 tortillas next to it and a small cup of tasteless beans.  No other toppings, etc.  The house margarita was fine.  The place was cool but the food was not at all worth it.  Good thing I enjoyed the company I had."}
{"text":"Let me start with our waitress, very friendly and quick and pleasant shout out to Brooke! Atmosphere is super cute and fun for cocktails. Food has zero flavor. We had the tamale, cerviche, cucumber salad and chicken tacos. Nothing has any seasoning, even with the salsa bar....please add seasoning. Bland, bland, bland! Go for drinks and then eat at Mac's (same owners but better food)."}
{"text":"I love their whole patio set up! I'd really give like 3.5 stars if I could. And here's why...

Came here on a Wednesday like 2:30 with a large group. Place was dead. Seated right away I think? But I wasn't first to arrive from group. The indoor look isn't bad, and the patio is sweet. I can appreciate their whole \"hang ten\" theme they got going on  Here's what I tried...

*Adobo chicken quesadilla $10 - pineapple, corn, black beans, cheese, chicken, & cilantro. Sounds amazing, amirite? Well the pineapple was amazing in there, grand idea! The corn was like grilled and also perfect combo. The chicken....not so much. It wasn't my favorite and it's a chicken quesadilla so kinda important. Just seemed bland or something. Like the rest was so good but the chicken took away from all the flavor. 
*Big serving, comes with gauc and a side of choice of beans. When I ordered this, my server right away asked me if I wanted sour cream on the side? So I was like um yeah sure! Like why not right?...well when I got my bill it was $1.50 for sour cream. Not cool. At least let a sister know!

Y'all know I'm a margarita girl....so
* Cantarito (marg) $10 - Had grapefruit...sounded good. But it was very tart!! And I love margaritas so it's hard to disappoint. But I was. 

So there you have it. I ordered 2 things during lunch time and my bill was $24 before tip. I just thought it was kinda pricey...but comparing to some places maybe it's not. Just would have liked this place more if: chicken was good, marg was better, and they didn't charge extra for sour cream. But...that's just me! 

I'm gonna give this place another try one day. Go ahead and try them out and see what you think!"}
{"text":"The food is definitely different and quite tasty, drinks weren't anything special or something to rave about. Service on the other hand was obnoxious, I don't know what planet our server was on but it wasn't at SouthBound. It took an ungodly amount of time to receive anything we ordered and she was literally at the table every five minutes trying to turn her table (which I completely understand but doing so noticeably is going to hurt you in the long run)."}
{"text":"Not impressed. While the space is beautiful, the food & drinks were underwhelming. I started with the sangria. Kind of tasted like cider (it has cinnamon) no fruit and seemed like no alcohol. Was let down by the size (looked to be no more than an 8oz glass with ice) for a steep $7. For appetizer, had the chicharrones (pork rinds). Those were good! The taco menu needs to have the ingredients listed with the names. It required too much explanation from the server. While she was enthusiastic and patient, she was also slightly condescending sharing with us that these tacos were authentic and don't have shredded cheese & sour cream... but we weren't asking for that at all. I know what a damn taco is, I just want to know what's in the one I'm about to order!  The tacos were fresh, but I think all mine had flour when I ordered one of them to have corn tortilla. My shrimp taco leaked oil water a lot. 
She also raved about the salsa bar and that was also underwhelming.. they all seemed to taste the same and just have a liquid consistency. 
All in all, I just think I'll come back for beer and atmosphere. Maybe I'll try the guacamole because they said that was made fresh. But until then, I'm happy to have my tacos and fresh salsa bar somewhere else (locally owned Sabor is amazing if anyone needs a recommendation)"}
{"text":"My friend and I had been looking forward to this place opening but were kind of underwhelmed.  Everything was technically cooked well but lacked in flavor across the board.  We ordered the chips & pico, baja grilled cheese, two tacos a piece and churros.  The quesadilla was probably the worst, it's literally tortilla and cheese.  Nothing to give it any flavor on its own, asides from the salsa bar.  Please, at least throw some drained pico in with the cheese, maybe some seasoning.
Carne asada was cooked beautifully...but had no flavor.  The al pastor was the best but that's probably owing more to the pineapple than anything else.  Same for the churros - the pate a choux was done perfectly but it still lacked flavor and the chocolate syrup was cold and strangely liquidy.

Look, I know it's charlotte but I'd rather you blow my taste buds out by putting the flavor pedal to the metal rather than the tentative flavor attempt.  Also, get some bigger salsa cups than the Wendy's ketchup cups."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great, food though was cold and bland. We waited over an hour, so when the food came out cold I was a little disappointed"}
{"text":"I'm hoping on the SouthBound train and heading to So-Cal!  Ok, well, I'm actually getting in an Uber and heading to South Blvd for some So-Cal food...but close enough.

I went to SouthBound on Friday at 7pm.  Bad call for timing on my part to go during an opening week during dinner on a Friday.  The wait just to put my name in was 15 minutes, and the wait for a table after that was an hour and a half.  The ambiance was a super cool yet casual So-Cal vibe, with string lights and bright colors.  The outside patio has a ton of seating and you can even bring your dog.

Drinks at the bar were in order!  I ordered the El Bandito, which I really enjoyed.  There were also Margaritas (I thought they were ok, but a little sweet...all pre-made and come out of a tap) and Tecate (couple different kinds if you're a fan) involved in the night.  Overall, the drinks were pretty solid and so was the menu.

FINALLY, we sit down and immediately start ordering food.  First off, I think the prices are completely reasonable.  It's So-Cal taco-joint inspired food on the menu is all a-la-carte, so you even order the chips separately.  We started with the Pico de gallo (was decent) and street corn (really good).  Then it was followed by a whole mess of food...So-Cal burrito, Carne Asada Tacos, Machaca Beef Tacos, Pork Pastor Tacos...you can see where this is going.  All of their Masa is made in house and the tortillas were gooooooood.  The flower tortillas don't have that rubbery taste and the corn ones aren't disintegrating in your hand while you're eating.  Everything was really good.  Don't forget to end the night with some Churros (come 3 per order with chocolate sauce)!

Being from Arizona and taking many visits to Southern California, I've become super picky about my tacos.  I can confidently say that SouthBound did a great job bringing this So-Cal cuisine to Charlotte.  I'll certainly be back, but not during a busy time of day!  Just an FYI, since it was busy, the wait was long and the service was a bit slow.  I would give this place a few weeks to settle down before going."}
{"text":"SouthBound is everything! The food and the vibe are amazing. Of course, everyone has a right to their opinion, but I couldn't disagree more with most of the reviews. Sadly, most Americans are so conditioned to lots of salt and add ons and huge American sized portions. The food at SouthBound is simple and fresh. I really wish Americans would consider a different approach to eating as it would solve our health crisis in this country. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Guacamole, margaritas and tortillas. The three essentials for an authentic northern Mexico/southern California establishment. All need extreme refinement before this native San Diego resident returns. And scrap the mango tamales. It's flavorless masa. I appreciate this is a soft opening and expect service, timing and organizational pieces to improve over time. Unfortunately the approach to the quality and details of the food and margaritas (the \"Cadillac\" at $15 is an insult and tastes like the house marg on tap with a drop of gran marnier) seem deliberate and are disappointing. Hopefully things improve for the sake of true Mexican cuisine and not just some southerners' interpretation."}
{"text":"My team and I came here for after work dinner and drinks the first week it was open. Thankfully, we arrived early enough to be seated immediately, but it took a while to order drinks and apps. I think from the time we were seated to initially served it was 20-25 minutes. It wasn't a big deal at the time because we were chatting and catching up on the day. Once we finally got our drinks, they were amazing. I highly recommend the drinks. Everyone enjoyed what they ordered, and the margarita I got was amazing. Sadly, when it came time for the appetizers and food, it went downhill fast. The guacamole was bland and slimy. The pork rinds were flavorless, and the dipping sauce was the only saving grace. I ordered the tacos, and they were bland and dry. Tacos are my favorite and I enjoy trying new places, but I was underwhelmed by these. I tried to order another drink to help wash down the dry tacos, but our server was MIA most of the meal. She was nice, but the service was extremely slow.

TL;DR - the drinks were amazing, the atmosphere was awesome, the food was bland/dry and the service wasn't good.

I'd recommend this place for happy hour, but nothing more."}
{"text":"Go there for drinks and the atmosphere - not the food! Although I'm hoping they switch it up and change my opinion as they fine tune the menu since it's brand new...Here is a quick recap - ceviche is so salty and barely any white fish...go to Soul Gastrolounge if this is what you want. Tacos are bland, except for the Pork Pastor, and the baja fish was ok. The shrimp taco...where was the shrimp, I ask? Must still be in the ocean...because it wasn't in the taco. And then they rave about the sauce bar - of the 6 sauces, 4 tasted like chipotle and the other two; cilantro cream was OK and the mild salsa (I think that was the harvest salsa?) I would describe as \"trash juice\" while my friend went with \"dirty dish water\"...so take you're pick. All in all, great place for drinks and socializing before you go elsewhere for dinner. I'm hoping this changes! Maybe new restaurants should provide customer feedback forms as they figure things out - just a thought!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. It's so close to work that my coworkers and I can walk for lunch. We go to Macs next door quite frequently, so this would be nice to add to the rotation.

Ambiance 3 stars: Architecture is nice, very Cali style - coming from Vegas (and my SoCal trips)- it really hit the Cali charm. Plenty of outdoor seats to enjoy warm weather, I think you are allowed to bring your dogs, i drove by in the evening and saw furry friends relaxing on the patio. Since moving to Charlotte I've noticed that many restaurants have bad acoustics. Can't quite have a conversation at the table without yelling. Lots of hard surfaces - but I guess part of that industrial charm, but if I can order drinks in a crowded club, this place is not a problem.

Food 2.5 stars: For the prices and the look of the place, there was not much to eat. Average 3.50 per \"street\" taco. And by \"street\" I mean the 2-3 bites and they are gone. Had the Carne Asada and the Pork Pastor and as a side I got their version of \"elotes\".

Tacos with their respective toppings were good. Nice mix of veggies and meat. Meat could be a little  bit more seasoned, but I guess that is why they have the Salsa bar off to the side. Side note: the Creamy chipotle was out and quite a few people were waiting for them to refill it, but the whole time while we were dining, it never got replenished. I kept an eye on it, as I wanted to try it as well. Out of the 5 salsas the smoked salsa was my fave - they had standard salsas verde, pico de gallo, mild, hot etc.

Their street corn (elotes) were ok at best. Missed the lemon taste and I wish it came with the wooden spears to eat it better. You only had 2 options: hold it with your hands and get them all messy or cut the corn off with the knife. I know it's \"street\" - but for the gigantic plate it comes on, I would have hoped it would come with the spears so you could enjoy this meal without utensils, but not end up with a gigantic mess.

One colleague had the Carne Asada Plate $10: You may think you get more for the price, but it's just 2 carne asada tacos (3.50 ea a la carte) and a small side of beans and by small, i mean usually the salsa dish or dipping sauce dish size. I don't think it justifies the extra $3.

Their review: the plate was more a deconstructed taco with not more extra.

One colleague had their SoCal Burrito  $10: Nothing much to say, Burrito with the same size beans as above.

Their review: Ok. wished the side was bigger.

The one criticism we all had: For a place this nice, with the price and the assumption to be a good hangout spot, we were surprised that chips and salsa wasn't free. Didn't have to be unlimted refills, but to just snack on on the table. Especially in the evening, over a few drinks. We found it was really odd, as this place looked perfect for hanging-out. 

Guys, your neighbor MACs gives hush-puppies! So if I had the choice of hanging out with friends drinking Margaritas / Sangria and nothing over beers and hush puppies. Beer and hush puppies win. You want the costumer to hang out and linger and buy drinks and be social. 

It's opening week, so maybe these reviews will help the kick-it up a notch moving forward."}
{"text":"It's very early spring and we had one of those remarkably warm days... 75 degrees at 5pm and my wife and I want to sit out on a patio and enjoy the weather over dinner.  We only live 8-10 blocks from here, so we decided to give it a shot.

The queso on our appetizer was sent back... seriously grainy (overcooked) but yet somehow just barely luke warm and tasteless.  They took it off the bill and left the chips (crispy and wonderfully salty w/ some good salsa, so it wasn't a complete fail).

I had a taco trio and they were OK.  Nothing super special, but they were hot and made with fresh ingredients.  The fish tacos were probably the best on the plate.  My house margarita wasn't bad... again, nothing super special, but a solid margarita.

My wife's chicken quesadillas, on the other hand, were a complete bust.  The tortillas were stale (rubbery and tasted of cardboard) and there wasn't much cheese in there (which is hard to believe for a dish that is named for the cheese)... you would pick up a piece and everything would just fall apart.  The chicken was cold and pretty tasteless. 

This is a beautiful building with a great vibe... The front of the house was just let down horribly by the kitchen, which couldn't live up.

We probably won't be back unless they undergo a massive transformation."}
{"text":"Two stars only because it's pretty inside and out. But the food is really not great. If I wanted some crummy American tacos I'd make them in my microwave at home. The drinks are good but they are very small for the price."}
{"text":"The negative reviews are over the top for this new South End spot. Outside of the salsa/sauce bar complaints (warranted, no point for that really, just pair each sauce with each taco and bring it with the taco, problem solved) I really found it to be a chill, delicious and comfortable experience. The tacos was great; nice and light but with plenty of flavor to keep you wanting more. The margs were not too bad either. I will definitely be back when I am in the mood for tacos!"}
{"text":"Really good, overly stuffed tacos! Quick service, with lots of food to choose from on the menu. We will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"SouthBound or should I say \"Bound to go South\" if they don't step it up big time.  Driving by this place and having watched it being built from the ground up, I had much anxiety to try it out.   To start, the building's aesthetics were very unique as there were lots of space and room for activities! That being said, it seems like they made no effort to provide any sort of quality service.
 
The drinks were slow, 14 minutes slow, Apple Watch Series 1 doesn't lie. If you know me well, I want my drinks fast and furious.  Of course I had to get the Margarita with no salt, don't ask (HIPPA). It was a little sweet just like my YiaYia and I could taste the tequila, mucho bueno!  If you can crave the wait time down, it would be fantastic. 
 
The food...nothing to write about, but then again I am writing.  I had the Carnitas, which tasted good. The flavor wasn't bad, but like the wise man Salvador Sanchez once told me, \"you eat with your eyes\". So with that, the appearance was awful and the plating was too small. Felt like I was eating at the children's table which I haven't done that since Thanksgiving 2013. The side beans...boring, dull, monotonous, tasteless and dry.  Fix it. 

Like most places in South End it is popular to sit outside, but for SouthBound sitting outside means you could possibly lose your hearing by all of the motorcycles leaving Mac's Speed Shop. Better bring ear plugs.  This will be the downfall to SouthBound.
 
Our waitress, she was nice, but could have been around more... Also the food runners played auction as they would randomly come to your table with food you didn't order, very disorganized.   

Overall, much improvement is needed and SouthBound is headed South if nothing changes.  

Will I be back?  Will Trump be elected for a second term?"}
{"text":"Well, call me stupid but I tried it again. No change still infant size tacos very little of substance. I'm sorry but if I were Jimmy Johnson I would take my name off this place. Don't win races or fans serving food like this."}
{"text":"Great service by Wes and awesome taco Tuesday specials! The margaritas were strong and the Baja fish taco was my favorite. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So far fairly underwhelmed about this place. Starting out, I love the CONCEPT of this place! The area could use a good taco bar since Maverick Rock Taco closed but Southbound falls far short of the need! 

The good: cheap beers and good cocktails round out a good atmosphere and awesome decor. I like the fact that there aren't any TVs in the place and you have to interact with the people you one with and your fellow patrons. So, if you plan to come here for drinks it's a good spot but, that's where the good ends. 

The bad: Portion sizes and FLAVOR! Both my wife and I left hungry! I'd expect to leave full for a $66 tab. Two tacos the size of my palm and a ketchup side container of flavorless beans for $10? My wife's taco was the same for $3.5?! The ceviche we got filled a third (if that) of the bowl it came in with a hand full of chips as a side. The flavor of all the above dishes were lacking. If you're going to claim to be a taco bar to need to deliver. 

The Ugly: parking. Not their fault and can't be blamed on the establishment but just be warned it can be tough to find a spot and we went on a Wednesday night around 8. We will come back later after they have had some time to work out the kinks and try it again to see. 

Conclusion: if you're looking for a place to get a couple cheap beers and hang outside in good weather, great! But, if you're looking for a place to get dinner just got to Mac's next door and mosey on over afterwards to get a couple cheap Mexican beers and hang out in the bier garden style area afterwards."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a shot despite the poor reviews it seemed to be receiving. The margaritas were pretty average and the food was below average. Service was ok but I'm assuming everyone is paying attention to the reviews because the place was less than half full in a Saturday night. The salsa was great! The only great part of the place. Probably won't be back...which is a shame because it looks wonderful from the outside and is in a great location"}
{"text":"Went on 1/11/18. Server was very nice and friendly and mostly attentive. 

Tasted a few different margaritas-- The top shelf/Cadillac is tasty but $15 is silly in Charlotte (even in Uptown...Vida...) Had the El Bandito and it tasted like melted plastic, not even close to smoky. Server took it off the bill. 

Tacos were ice cold ? but were not the worst we've had. Just weird that there was a lot of effort put into them and they were cold. And shouldn't have been. 

Decor is very So Cal surfer Tex Mex white dude thing. Nice patio area for warmer weather. 

If you're in the neighborhood, it's fine. Not a destination spot. If you want quality, go to Paco's Tacos"}
{"text":"Pros: great drinks, very awesome design and concept, good service

Cons: food was awful, tacos cold, shrimp and fish were barely visible and also tasteless, guac was very smooth

Really hope they turn it around because it has the potential to be super cool and trendy, but it has a lot to compete with having Babalu down the road and Cabo in NoDa."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went in there tonight. We had tried to get in sooner but being new, it was always packed. 
 I've got to be honest. I LOVE Mac's. I think their food is some of the best around. However, that being the case the amount of disappointment was ten fold. We're friends. So cal so the bar is higher however and I hate to say it, but the food was completely flavorless. The adobo chicken tacos looked like they would have a ton of flavor but just didn't. The carne asada, I'd rather have a taco from the taco truck @ Nations Ford and Arrowood. The pastor, which I thought would be great,( because of the whole Mac's thing) again looked great but, NO flavor. The ceviche was good and the shredded beef taco was good. And the service was weird. Had to get up and go get my own plates and silverware. Kept getting wrong items sent to our table and just kinda felt like we were castaways. 
I don't think we'll be back anytime soon. Trust me I hate to say that. I'll probably eat at Mac's like 3 times this week. 
I hope they work it out. I believe in the company but wouldn't suggest this place to anyone who really likes tacos."}
{"text":"Decor and ambience were awesome and unique.  I never went inside so I'm just talking abt the exterior.  It wasn't busy at all on Friday after Thanksgiving.  Service was fine - but strange - must have had at least five people come to our table for one thing or another.  Margs were 5 stars and salsa was fresh and very tasty!  I didn't care for the queso, but maybe too rich for me.  I would definitely return for great drinks and ambience."}
{"text":"Thanks to yelp we knew what to expect when we arrived here on a beautiful Saturday afternoon.  A pretty day is the best time to visit southbound, they have one of the coolest indoor/outdoor patios in town.  We started off with chips and guac, we ordered a large for $10 and the guac was way to small to be called a large but we were expecting that so it did not deal us a big blow.  We also ordered the street corn and for $3, it is the best value on the menu.  Perfectly roasted, topped with white sauce and queso fresco.  I would come back just for the corn, myself.  We were told that the salsas are for the tacos to be topped however you like but we still went to the salsa bar and loaded up the little cups for the chips.  The little cups are cracking me up as if they are going to deter people from using the salsa bar for their chips.  They didn't deter us!  We ordered the platos mexicanos, which is what I recommend you do.  They are like deconstructed tacos you make yourself.  I had the carne and Taryn ordered the chicken mole.  The carne was just perfect, I loved it and for $10 I thought the portion was fair.  She really like her chicken mole as well, shredded chicken with an ok flavor, not my fave, but she liked it!  The tortillas were the bomb, handmade, fresh and really tasty.  The food was really good but best part of our experience was our waitress Brooke.  She was very informative about the style of food and what to expect when we ordered.  She made the visit a success!  See you again soon Southbound!"}
{"text":"If it's a nice night in CLT, you'll find me sitting out at this patio. The fiance and I came around 8pm on a Friday and were able to be seated towards the back of the patio with no wait. It was busy, but not insane. We started with the complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were hot and crispy and the salsa had a nice flavor with a little smokiness and was mild.

A pitcher of their house margs were $26 and we were told there was 4 glasses in it... there were definitely more than 4! They were yummy and strong and a really good value compared to ordering a cocktail anywhere else.

For dinner, I ordered the veggie quesadilla, which was excellent! It came with pico and quac and had a nice variety of veggies inside. It was more than I could eat in a sitting, so LEFTOVERS!

Our server was super sweet and very attentive. We will definitely be returning and hoping that there is more parking available next time."}
{"text":"Popped in here for dinner for the first time and got the So Cal Burrito.  It was just ok, I would try the tacos if I go back. The sauce bar was good and our waitress was great."}
{"text":"The food is good but service is ridiculous. The owners know the issues and refuse to address them. They also look at Yelp and ignore it."}
{"text":"Spare yourself. This place might not ever get their S* together. We went there last night for Taco Tuesday to try it out after hearing all the terrible things about it, we needed to see for ourselves. To our surprise the place was only half full. We go to hostess to get a table and she informs us it will be a 45 min wait. WHAT?! There are VISIBLY more than 20 tables wiiideeee open and we only have a party of 3. I ask the hostess how that can be and she turned and walked away. My guess is that they're severely understaffed but that would have been nice for her to communicate. We ended up going across to Mac's and had a great dinner, sadly it was not at SouthBound."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere but totally disappointed by the menu. I went to lunch with my dad thinking oh there's a new taco spot and that's what it literally was a taco spot. The only thing on the menu was basically tacos but they were so small that it was more like a snack. I ordered three tacos to start with and when I looked at my shrimp taco I only had maybe two medium size shrimp. I asked the waitress if the taco really only comes with two shrimp and she was like no I think it comes with more but when she went to the kitchen she found out it really did only comes with two pieces of shrimp. She was really nice and brought me another taco but I was very surprised by the price and amount of food. I think this is a great spot to go have a drink and socialize with your friends but not a place for dinner. I also tried the street corn which was good. The salsa was fresh but a very small amount. I was disappointed by the sauce bar there was a dirty plate laying there and a little white cups were blowing away by a fan that was overhead. I talk about the size of the tacos but the flavor was actually pretty good very unique ... just wish there was more meat than lettuce. I would go back to grab a drink with friends. I like the inside outside concept."}
{"text":"I'd heard mixed reviews about SouthBound but am never one to judge a new spot until I experience it for myself, so I figured I'd give it a few months to settle in to the scene. I'm so happy with my experience! Tuesday's 1/2 off sangria pitchers and $2 tacos are an easy sell, let's be serious. Our server was very friendly and checked on us multiple times throughout the night, making sure our sangria glasses were always filled. The chips were thin and crispy and the pico was delish. I ordered two tacos and was satisfied with my decision (Baja fish and machaca beef - both flavorful and great on the corn tortilla). Can't wait to come back for more tacos and sangria!!"}
{"text":"Really disappointing.  Such great work with the venue itself, only to then have a mediocre menu with terribly poor execution.  Service is really lackluster as well.  Bland food would have been more bearable had they asked if we wanted a second drink. Food : 1star. Service : 1star. Drinks : 3star. Venue : 4star.   It seems clear that management is in way over its head, training and execution are hugely lacking.     Chips are pretty good - would have been better with a salsa refill.  Drinks are fine, good enough place to go for drinks on the patio, look elsewhere for food or even decent Mexican dining."}
{"text":"Meh. It's fine. Everything is fine. SouthBound is fine. 

I've withheld judgement until I could visit a few times because I had a hard time grasping exactly what SouthBound was going for. As it turns out, I think SouthBound may just have an identity crisis. They try to be SoCal, Mexican street food, trendy Southend and casual/rock-n-roll like Mac's all at the same time. The final product is a big, ol' mess of average food and pretty spotty service. 

Our first visit was about a month after they opened. We went in with rock bottom expectations because of the pitiful reviews that were plaguing them but were really pleasantly surprised! Was the \"market price\" guacamole laughably small? Sure! But it was tasty, too! As was all the other food we ordered on that first visit. Service was also incredibly friendly and attentive. 

Following visits left me wanting more. On our second trip in, we noticed they caved to pressure and did away with the salsa bar and a la carte chips and dips. They're now serving free baskets of chips and salsa. I miss the salsa bar. The food was a little lackluster on this visit but the pitcher of half-priced margaritas conveniently helped us overlook that. Service was average. 

My third visit pretty much sealed SouthBound's fate and crossed them off my go-to list. I met a business acquaintance there for Taco Tuesday. All tacos are billed as $2 but as soon as I ordered the tuna taco, the waitress told me that one wasn't included in the special. Ok, fine. Give me the shrimp taco instead. I had the shrimp, mahacta beef, and al pastor tacos on corn tortillas. They were worth the $2 each but just barely. The shrimp were the best of the worst. The beef was tough and dry. The al pastor was fatty and flavorless. 

After the meal, our waitress just disappeared. I finally flagged down the hostess to track down our waitress and the check. She brought it then disappeared again. It took her so long to come back to run the card that my lunch date actually got up and left. (She had a 2pm meeting she was going to be late for.) When it was all said and done, it took almost half an hour from the time we were done eating to the time I was signing the check. Obviously not ideal for a quick business lunch. 

Moral of all this is that while the food is edible and cheap (at least on Taco Tuesdays, assuming you don't want the tuna taco), there are way too many delicious, authentic Mexican spots in East Charlotte to put up with SouthBound's seemingly downward spiral."}
{"text":"This place has really gotten its stuff together!!! I came when they first opened and it was not great but I decided I would give them another chance.  Glad I did.  My daughter and I enjoyed it so much we have been back twice in the same week. The food has improved drastically and the service was amazing.  Don't write this place off. Do yourself a favor and give it another chance!"}
{"text":"Great food! I had the carne asada and machaca tacos both delicious. Great service too."}
{"text":"As someone who takes yelp reviews pretty seriously, I was cautious to try this place out given the feedback I've seen on here. However, I do live walking distance from this place and I am pretty lazy so I wandered over to give this place a try. I was not disappointed. Allow me to share my experience: 

The staff is friendly and getting a table is quick. This place frequently has drink specials (like, every day of the week) which is always a bonus in my book. Most importantly, there is bottomless chips and salsa that you will quickly fall in love with, and if you're anything like me, will pound three orders and probably ruin your dinner. 

Still, I ordered dinner and was glad I did. Their tacos, I believe, are the way to go. Baja Fish and Carne Asada are two of their most popular. I had the Machaca Beef as well but wasn't a fan. My boyfriend ordered the Baja Fish Burrito which was good, but had a little too much avocado (yes avocado fans, too much IS possible) which over powered the fish. Point being, stick with the tacos and you'll be satisfied. 

Overall, yes this is a new restaurant that is still figuring things out, but they're constantly updating  their menu to make improvements and are open to customer feedback. If you're looking for a chill spot to grab an inexpensive meal in Southend, come to this place for some decent tacos, delicious margs and quality chips and salsa."}
{"text":"This place is a great spot for taco Tuesday! $2 tacos and half price pitchers are hard to beat! The California burrito is on point too!"}
{"text":"Eh... being from Southern California, I can say that a lot more needs to happen to claim SoCal here. Tacos lacked flavor. The fish taco was over-battered.  If you are mentioning California, you must master a fish taco or not have it on the menu. Pastor was very dry. Guacamole was sub par, again... a CA staple. Hope this gets better... I was so hoping for a taste of home. Ambience is great; may be a fabulous spot for drinks.  I'd head to Comida, Babalu, or Sabor instead. I hope it gets better!!!"}
{"text":"Wife, kid and I stopped by for a later dinner on Sunday. I would define the food as Southern California Mexican. Much healthier than typical Mexican restaurants and not as heavy has Tex-Mex. Perhaps we call this \"Cal-Mex\"?

I had their southern California burrito. Much lighter and healthier than I was expecting, but tasty nonetheless. Side was beans and fresh salsa which I drizzled over my burrito with each bit. Yum.

My wife had the Carne Asada and she mentioned it was extremely good. The biggest thing she kept saying: it's much healthier than our typical favorite for Mexican food (La Unica).

Our daughter had a kids taco with a fruit side. Nothing left!

For drinks we both had margaritas - perfectly balanced.

We finished off the evening with two deserts: churros in chocolate sauce and a cinnamon rice pudding. Both were excellent. Of special note: the churros are made on the spot fresh. That's rare and a welcome treat.

All in all I highly recommend this place. Spacious inside and has a great vibe. Server was excellent too. Really made me miss southern California."}
{"text":"Great location and environment! Love the Tuesday specials"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place after hearing so much about it and seeing the cool exterior while driving by. I certainly won't be back for a while. We started with the salsa which ended up being a plate of flavorless chips and a small portion of salsa. Ok, at least the salsa had good flavor but definitely had to work hard to share the small amount with 3 people. Had tacos as my meal, only ordered two, but with the size could have ordered about 3 more. Really small in size, and overall not much flavor. The bar had a nice selection of tequilas, but terrible beer selection. It has been a few weeks since I've been, and maybe they have changed since then, but there wasn't a single Charlotte brew available that I could see. Just maybe try and support local. The open air feel if the space is nice, but unfortunately not enough to make me want to go back. It'll be interesting to see if this place changes at all in the next few months."}
{"text":"Tacos tasted awesome, although somewhat small portions (servers, do not explain how your tacos arent tex mex and how you are different blah blah blah....the menu says it all and haters gnna hate regardless of what you tell them ahead of time) and drinks were on point. Awesome venue with an open layout. Their salsa bar is a an absolute joke... its a giant ladle to pour salsa into a ketchup cup (the kind you see at a fast food joint).  The reviews do seem a little harsh and I wish that sentiment would carry over to other places in clt... but southbound will work out these kinks and would definitely go back.  If yelp had a detailed review I would give 3.7 stars"}
{"text":"Talk about an identity crisis! This restaurant is supposedly Southern California style, which I was intrigued by since I spent 33 years of my life in Southern California before moving to Charlotte. Nope. I'd say it's Tex Mex trying to be upscale...I guess? 

Admittedly, the inside of the restaurant is super cute. I really liked the decor. They initially tried to seat my wife with a broken foot in full walking boot at a high-top table, but they were nice enough to accommodate us at a lower one so she wouldn't have to perilously dangle her broken appendage. 

We started off with some cocktails: a Tequila sunrise (on special) and a tipsy burro, which is their variation of a mule. Awful drinks. Very watered down and zero flavor. You know it's not a happy start to the meal when the cocktails are wrong. 

Chips and salsa came, pretty good there but it's tough to mess those up.

We started with the carne asada fries for an appetizer. The plate was absolutely massive. The carne asada meat was good, if not authentic. This was probably the better of the dishes we tried. 

I got the two taco plate. The machaca, which supposedly had all kinds of delicious spices and flavors, tasted like I was putting coffee grounds all over my food. It was just overwhelming thick, with no discernible flavors of the meat itself. I didn't even want the second veggie taco I had ordered at that point. I did nibble a chunk of corn, which wasn't seasoned well. It's like all of the seasoning was just off somehow. 

My wife ordered the chilaquiles and was horrified to receive it with a SCRAMBLED egg. That's not at all what chilaquiles should be like, and she despises scrambled eggs. She did send it back and got the correct version of the dish but still didn't enjoy it much. 

Our waitress was nice in the beginning, only to vanish halfway through the meal, never to be seen again. It took a long time to get the check, etc. She asked if we wanted boxes...definitely declined that offer. 

We won't be back."}
{"text":"We visited on Halloween and were seated immediately as the restaurant was nearly empty. The pleasant hostess offered us a choice of inside or outside. As there was a nip in the air, we opted for inside. And, as the hostess indicated, with the garage doors open, it was the best of both worlds. We took our time with the drink menu mostly because I forgot my glasses - yikes! And, I wish that I had hurried! The \"on tap\" bevs - simple 'ritas were very slow to come from the bar. We ordered guacamole and chips to start. The guac was brown but, still flavorful. We asked for and received help on choices from our server. I ordered the carne asada. My hubby got the chilequiles. Our second round of drinks for being \"on tap\" in an empty restaurant were painfully slooow. My dish was okay. Not quite up to par with what I've enjoyed in SoCal or Miami. My hubby's dish was very subpar. Typically, the chips to comprise this dish are crispy not soft as the server claimed. And the street corn was definitely cooked in the wee hours of the morning and re-heated just prior to serving. The spices were not at all consistent. My hopes for this new venue were quickly dashed. Insert frowns face here."}
{"text":"First of all- the build out is stunning. This is a beautiful restaurant in an amazing location. Atmosphere? I'd give it more than five stars if I could! So excited to come and check this place out until we were seated on the patio and not greeted for over 20 minutes. 

Being in the industry and not in a rush it was more a game of \"how bad will this get.\" At 25 minutes (and after watching a couple at the table next to us that did not get greeted either
 get up, leave, and go to a different restaurant) we informed the host stand that no one had talked to our table. We were then greeted with an apology and a \"sorry the host stand didn't tell us that so and so went to walk her dog\" and then service continued like normal. 

To be real, our server was delightful. She was charismatic, gave us a great spiel about the menu and was super friendly. Was it timely? Not exactly.  Was she one of the people who walked past our empty table and didn't notice we were sitting there with nothing but the menus a bored host dropped off? Yes. Did a manager stop by and acknowledge that it's not okay to wait for almost a half hour to get any sort of service? No.

The guacamole lacked flavor and tasted more like overblended avocado than anything. The tacos were alright but again lacked flavor and were pretty cold.. all in all this is a beautiful building and I hope they get their service issues straightened out to match the beauty of the location."}
{"text":"Server - First Bailey and then Haley (we changed tables as we were getting too much sun). Both servers were fabulous.

Atmosphere - Love the indoor outdoor place to see and be seen vibe.

Bonus - They don't use plastic straws which is awesome for our environment.  If your straw is in your drink too long and gets soft, don't complain just flip it - bottom to top and top to bottom - and voila your straw is fine.   OR toss the straw entirely.  Did you really need a sippy cup at your age???

What we would order again -
Chips
Guacamole
Mexican Street corn (off the cob)
Fried shrimp tacos 
Chicken tacos with adobo
Sangria

What we would recommend to the owners -
* A hot version of your salsa - we did use all extra additives provided on the table, but still no.
* Regular salsa needs a tad less lemon or lime juice.  Slight overkill."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant that needs tons of work on sanitation, food  and service. My God it was soooooo loud you could not have a conversation. It's a simple menu but yet it took an hour to bring out our food. They should have been popping out the orders. Again, Simple menu . It was like chaos in there. Very poor magn't and organization. We asked for the check for our drinks(which are only Mexican beer)  so we could leave and Our waiter apologized profusely for the wait. She told us it was terrible and they would not even let her take a bathroom break she was in near tears. So they got the food to us finally! There is a condiment bar I would avoid like the plague. People were not careful over slopping using their hand to pick up and put back in container Fair warning if you want to get sick be my guest! Now the food! We all left still hungry. Very small portions hence the tapas but fair warning tacos are 4 \" diameter and tasteless and I wasn't going to the condiment bar to add flavor trust me on that one! If you come with a hefty appetite be prepared to buy a lot of tacos to fill you. The guacamole was absolutely tasteless. If you like crushed plain avocado they have at it FLAVORLESS! Screwed up our check No surprise right?!  All in all it's new but stay away it's not worth it AT ALL. Buh -bye I'll never be back or rather the 4 of us. When all 4 say I'm still hungry and we all say check it off our list. Might want to take our advice unless you like wasting your money!  Enjoy........."}
{"text":"I came here for Taco Tuesday last week and it was so good, i came back again on this Tuesday. Street tacos that small but MIGHTY! I would recommend to start the fish and pork. Of course like any other Mexican restaurant  you start with chips and salsa. The salsa was just right and the chips were hot. It was packed but the food didn't take long.  I would say get there early if you want to get a booth. Those seem to fill up fast. Only compliant I would have is that the drinks come with paper straws. I don't want to take a star off for that but I hate paper straws. LOL I will be back, maybe next Tuesday! LOL"}
{"text":"The space is incredible!  lots of confusion over location of the parking lot as many cars tried pulling into the gravel near the bar.  they need to put bigger cups on the salsa bar and literally double the amount of ceviche that you get for $10.  not even being dramatic I was speechless and in shock when they brought me two spoonfuls of ceviche  there were more tomatoes in the bowl than there was fish."}
{"text":"The tacos were great and so were the drinks! Came here for lunch and now I'm definitely coming back for dinner."}
{"text":"Waited for table. No  menus provided. Seated 10 minutes with no staff interaction. Gone.  May be the new trendy place, but service stinks."}
{"text":"This place was really cool. The atmosphere was great, the food was great and the service was really great! I am hesitant to go to Mexican places because I am a vegetarian and can never find anything good but the veggie quesadillas were amazing! And the manager came by twice to make sure we were happy and taken care of.
You can't beat $2 tacos on Tuesdays. Also, great patio so cannot wait for warmer weather and happy hour. To sum up, GO THERE!"}
{"text":"Pretty much on the same page as everyone else here. Atmosphere is awesome and would go back for that alone. Prices are great too. Some people were complaining about the sizes of the tacos, but I thought it was a good amount of food for the money. 

Took awhile to get service at the bar even though it wasn't busy. Bartenders were preoccupied trying to figure something out on the POS system. 

My favorite thing was the baja fish taco (after adding lots of Cholula). Everything else really lacked flavor. I don't claim to know anything about SoCal food, but pretty sure its still supposed to taste like something. Was surprised to see $5 guac, but would rather pay $9 somewhere else. Mexican street corn was okay. My carne asada taco had a ton of meat on it, but it was so dry it was hard to choke down. Wasn't really a fan of any of the salsas on the salsa bar. Asked for corn tortillas and got flour, didn't mind since I don't have an allergy.

I feel like they will get a lot of this worked out and I will definitely give it a try in a couple of weeks because its such a cool place to hang out."}
{"text":"I came here from out of town and decided to stop here. I have to say they have a great setup. The street corn and carne asada taco were my favorite! You have to try them both. Also, we had guacamole and chips..chips were fresh and guca was ok. Shrimp taco was just ok. I was too hungry to take pictures,  but the pictures here are what you get."}
{"text":"Happened to visit on a taco Tuesday. I ordered the beef taco and sirloin taco. For $2 It was great lol I'm not sure I would've thought the same for their regular price. The seemed to be under staffed for a taco Tuesday. The tacos would've been better if there were some kind of sauce or something. The lime added great flavor but still a little on the dry side. I loved the decor and outside patio option!"}
{"text":"Southbound was fantastic! We had a wonderful experience - food, service, atmosphere - so I really don't understand all the bad reviews they are receiving... 

I thought they were surprisingly cheap when compared to other locations. I got out of there with 2 tacos, chips and pico (shared at with table), margarita and the street corn appetizer for $17 (and that was including tip). The tacos were $3.50 each and most places are charging at least $5/taco. 

They had a salsa bar (the chipotle crema, harvest salsa and the verde were delicious) and I was a little disappointed that we had to purchase chips and pico to be able to enjoy the salsa bar as is but at the end of the day, that really wasn't that big of a deal. People are also stating that the menu is small but I get overwhelmed with large menus so it made it easier for me to decide and it allows them to put quality in. 

The place itself was just very warm and welcoming - the large open room, the windows, open garage doors, and large COVERED patio seating. We walked in and immediately just felt a sense of relaxation."}
{"text":"Their drink menu was good.  I would have loved to been able to order one but instead we were at the bar for 30 minutes with no service.  They have a lot to work on."}
{"text":"Excellent experience overall. Warm hospitality and food was great. Waited on by James who was awesome (not to mention his taste in music as well). Will definitely be coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time yesterday and I wasn't impressed to say to the least. The food is mediocre and overpriced for what it is. A cup of guacamole for an appetizer is $9! I also wanted to get a glass of wine and they said they didn't have any wine at all due to their half-priced wine night on Wednesday...tell me why they haven't had time to get any wine whatsoever since Wednesday?? I was there on a Saturday. By the time we got our drinks and chips with guacamole, our waitress didn't come back to take our meal order until 30 min later! She was not very attentive. I ordered the spicy Caesar salad with baja fish. The fish was breaded and had no spices or flavor to it at all. The only thing saving this place is the cute atmosphere, that's why I gave this review 2 stars. I will not be going back though."}
{"text":"I was pretty pumped for this SoCal place but ended up slightly disappointed with the food value. The venue itself does have an awesome vibe (LOVE the covered outdoor area).

First of all, the drink prices seem really good. Most beers are $3-4 (bottled or 12 oz draft), and they have several specialty drinks that are on par with the Charlotte scene.

I ordered two tacos ($3 each) and the cuernavaca salad ($4), and it was like a lovely appetizer. It's a shame because both the fish taco and the veggie taco were pretty yummy, I just could have eaten about 4 more. The salad was also good, but a small bowl of cucumbers didn't make much of a dent in my appetite.

Pro tip: skip the cerveza en bolsa and just order a Tecate. Also, plan on going to dinner afterward."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful. Donovan gave us great service and the Sangaritas with brunch are to die for, especially at a discount. We will definitely be back to try more of the taco menu."}
{"text":"What a fun delicious find. Unlike most Texmex everything was very fresh and not over cooked. And James our waiter was fun, and knowledgeable. Great atmosphere as well. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I love all things tacos! I was so excited to try South Bound and understood that it was a SoCal type taco- higher end ingredients, fresh and minimal. 

The parking was simply a disaster! I looked for 15 minutes before finally finding one of the street. There were cars whipping into spots which they were too large for, people hitting others doors, frustrated drivers throwing up hands- not a good way to start an experience at a new place. If I hadn't been meeting people I would have just left. 

The space in incredible! So light and airy- I felt transported to somewhere tropical! It was roaring through and difficult to have conversation. 

The hostess stand was a hot mess. I was not greeted but rather they stated the wait time and ask for my name to be put on the list. Ladies were running everywhere preparing tables and even after our table was ready no one was there to seat us. We stood there for an additional 5 minutes- wth our stuff, drinks and a kid. 

We started with their margaritas. It was fine- nothing spectacular- it tasted like a mix and not a fresh homemade marg that I was expecting from a restaurant that boast about the quality of ingredients they use. 

The menu is basic but that is fine if you have flavorful dishes. You have to buy chips and pico or guac to use the salsa bar. We opted for the chips and pico and they were incredible! 

The taco were flavorless. I was glad that we bought chips so I could dress my tacos with pico in order to give it some flavor. We tried 4 different types of tacos and it was the same review across all 4- flavorless! The beans came out and they were luke warm and also lacking flavor.

Our server was hospitable. Our food came out quickly. Our food was taken away quickly even our chips before we were totally finished (this would be ok but let's keep in mind we had to purchase them). 

I will likely give them another try since they have only had a soft opening but I think lots of improvements are needed if this is going to be a place that sticks around!"}
{"text":"Opening night review -

Server team needs work. Ours did not know what a \"Machacha beef\" taco was. I asked what that tasted like/what it was, and the server said she hadn't had it and wasn't sure what it was... not a great response esp since this place has a very limited menu. 

Tacos review- not much flavor on either the carne asada, pork or chicken and these are VERY small tacos. If I had to go back, I'd choose carne asada. 

Guacamole and chips - guac was tasteless. Like a previous reviewer said, you can get better tasting guac in the grocery store. And there's about enough guac for 6 chips. 

Drinks (non-alcohol) - they give you glasses that hold probably 8oz. Hopefully you don't guzzle because the server was way too busy to be coming over and over again to refill your drink after you take two sips and it's empty. 

We left, still hungry, walked outside and smelt Mac's.... Next time we'll go there (fun fact-both southbound and mac's are owned by the same people).  

Positives- cool, open air venue."}
{"text":"After waiting for time to pass after the terrible initial reviews, we decided it was time to finally give SouthBound a try... and we're so glad we did! We went there for dinner tonight around 8:00 and had no problem getting a table for 2. Ashley was our server and she was great (big smile, attentive, and very friendly). We were happy to hear that the chips are now complimentary, but almost wish they weren't so we wouldn't have eaten so many. The salsa was amazing - fresh, chunky, and mild. We ordered queso which we didn't love. It was so thick that it was difficult to dip our chips in without them breaking, almost like it had been sitting out for awhile before it made it to our table (which wasn't the case due to the warm temp). We ordered the Baja fish burrito (ask for a side of the chipotle cream) and the chicken quesadilla. Both were delicious! The burrito was light and flavorful, and the chicken quesadilla had pineapple inside which was a perfect ingredient to compliment everything else. Don't forget the street corn - amazing. As if we had any room left over, Ashely brought us cinnamon churros with chocolate sauce because it was our first time visiting. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because it has such a great outdoor patio for eating, and I like the fast-casual taco style including the walk up taco window.  But when we sat down as a lager party for dinner, half of us had something wrong with the food we ordered, one persons food was only mildly warm, and the food was only okay. 
I think this place deserves a second chance, so I'll likely be back, but they could step up their game a bit."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good drinks. The menu needs some serious work though. We tried all of the tacos and also had their guacamole and pico. Tacos all tasted like cardboard with no noticeable flavors. Guacamole reminded me of the wholly guacamole you get at Harris teeter - not terrible, but also not something I would want to get at a restaurant. Pico was decent and so were the churros! Word on the street is that the chef is going for a simplistic so-cal menu which I can understand. Execution is laughable though. I just happened to spend a week in so-cal (la jolla & San Diego) a few days after eating at south bound. During this trip I visited numerous taco joints in the area including a favorite - Taco Stand. Each of the simple tacos i ate in so-cal at the taco stands that south bound is trying to imitate were SO much better and were extremely flavorful while still being relatively simple. Carne asada, chicken, shrimp, you name it - better, flavorful, and left me coming back for more. 

south bound recipe for success: fly chef and culinary team out to San Diego. Eat at Taco Stand for a week. Deconstruct and reverse engineer each of the tacos. Recreate in Charlotte. Smile as patrons rave about your food and the $$$ rolls in."}
{"text":"Southbound has a lot of problems to work out if they have any hope of long term success. Some issues are related to having too few servers, but ultimately they need help at every stage. Waited about 40 minutes for a table on Saturday at lunch, and eventually a server felt bad and seated us at the other side of a long table that was already occupied. (About half the tables were unused, it appears they did not have the staff to handle filling them).

We ordered immediately and food still took ages. A margarita ordered from the bar arrived at the same time our check did. There were multiple errors on the bill, which were corrected, but it was not worth the two hours we spent waiting for the table and the meal.

The food had potential,  but two of the entrées in our party of four arrived cold. One person at our table found a piece of paper in his enchilada. 

Do not waste your money, and most especially your time at an establishment that has not yet figured out the basics of staffing and service."}
{"text":"SouthBound is a great restaurant. I went in with little expectations because I had heard bad reviews regarding the place, however I went in due to their owners other restaurant Macs speed shop being so good, I thought it would be worth it to give it a try. The restaurant does a great job at achieving the SoCal vibe not only in the food but also in the restaurant decor.

The staff were very friendly and helpful, being that it was my first time. I came with friends and we each got tacos. We had the beer batter fried fish which was very flavorful and flaky, machaca beef which is a slow cooked shredded beef taco, and the pork pastor tacos which is slow cooked pork. The pork pastor taco and Mexican street corn were our favorite, however everything was still delicious. The tacos come in sets of 2 or 3 a side of rice and refried black beans or the rice and charro. I could go out with sides but the tacos were amazing. 

I definitely would come back again for dinner or lunch, the atmosphere and vibe is upbeat , casual, and eclectic. I definitely will be back in the summer time for a drink, chips and salsa and tacos. They have a great garage door they lift up in the summer."}
{"text":"Had take out today. 

I think chipotle and sabor (some sabor locations) are better than southbound.

I had the pork burrito.  The burrito itself is very skinny, it's not stuffy at all.  No salsa, or sour cream in there.  The rice and beans are pretty bland.  Meats are dry.

The only thing that able to snatch 2 stars is their container for the togo take out.

Won't be back..."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but southbound has the slowest service in America. It takes atleast 30 minutes for them to bring you a water and chips. And then atleast another 30 for them to even offer you the chance to get a drink but don't count on those taking less than 45 minutes to arrive. If you were in a relaxed mood willing to have a 3 hour dinner I would highly recomendó this establishment. Sorry! Not sorry"}
{"text":"I just wanted to start off by saying I don't understand why people review this place low at all. A lot goes in to a restaurant and knowing it is a new, I give them so much credit! They have plenty of time to fix the small things some are worried about like the paper cups for salsa and the paper straws. They are trying things to see what works and doesn't. Okay now for the review...

Taco bout a good place for tacos! SouthBound has an amazing menu with my personal favorite, authentic street tacos. Great prices and even better food. When deciding on a place to grab food in Charlotte there are so many options but this wins by far in my eyes. They did a great job making this place feel like you're relaxing in California. With the outdoor/indoor seating and what looks to be an outdoor area for bands to play, this is the new hot spot in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Growing up my mom always said to start with the positive. So here it goes... We decided to go to Southbound on a nice sunny day and sit on the patio. We arrived and the atmosphere was great. The hostess was very friendly and accommodating. She offered us some water while we waited. I love the bench that's out front on South Boulevard. It's really nice to have a place that's comfortable while you're waiting. Okay well here it goes the reason I gave 1 star. We waited about 15 minutes to get seated which wasn't that bad at all. Then, we ended up going to the table and waited and waited and waited and waited about 15 minutes before anybody came over to offer us any drinks appetizers or menus. Our waiter came over and was very apologetic. I definitely felt he was genuine because he was never told he had a table. Keep in mind he was very pleasant the entire time everything went downhill which was much appreciated. Ok... So I ordered The California Burrito medium rare and asked to keep the French fries out of burrito. They put them in it..  They remade it and they literally brought it back in like 3 minutes or less. I swear they flash fried the steak. It was pink and cold on the inside and barely cooked on the outside. So, our waiter agreed it wasn't made properly and they remade it again for the 3rd time. They brought it 45 minutes later and it was was cold. In the meantime I still had my rice and beans which we're getting cold and I was drinking water while waiting for my food. Luckily there we're chips and salsa (The salsa is delicious) For the water situation now.. Got to the bottom of carafe and there were tons of black specks of I have no idea what and food particles in it. I had already drank almost all of it. Uughh!! The waiter was extremely apologetic and made sure to check the next carafe he brought. Continue to keep in mind. He wasn't the problem. I watched the manager go to EVERY table but ours. I'm sure he didn't because he knew I was going to give him the business. So.. guess what? I received the check thinking there would be some sort of compensation. Nope! They still charged me for the food I waited over an hour for and extra 2 dollars for rice. The waiter was amazing but the managers took no authority in checking in on his patrons. Can't say I won't go back. Maybe it was a fluke thing but I'm definitely disappointed with the end result."}
{"text":"This is a neat place with some good tacos. The atmosphere takes some getting used to and I'm excited to visit it when the weather gets warm and the doors are all opened. 

On my visit, I was there for lunch and had great service at the bar. I didn't try any cocktails, but the homemade salsa is delicious and I enjoyed my three tacos."}
{"text":"Can't recommend this place enough! My fiance and I went for the first time last night for dinner, we sat at a high top table near their bar. The atmosphere is WONDERFUL. It felt like we were sitting outside, even though we weren't, the breeze was rolling through and the large windows allowed for a ton of natural light. We ordered one of their \"built your own bowls\" and chicken enchiladas. The carne asada built-your-own was TO DIE FOR and the enchiladas were so fresh. The waitress, Haley, came to our table SEVERAL times keeping us updated on the status of our food in the kitchen, as the enchiladas are super fresh and take a bit longer to prepare than the build-your-own bowl. Our drinks were never empty, the waitress was so personable and professional, we truly had a wonderful experience. We will definitely be back to try many more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Had carne asada and fish tacos.  So flavorful!  Michelada was delicious.  Like the feel of it, like I'm on vacation and the beach is just around the corner.  I'd stay here longer but I have errands to run.  Next time I'll stay and sit out in the patio."}
{"text":"When this place opened it was not good but they have completely redone their concept. They are really making an effort to give the people what they want. Ordered two tacos and both were good. The server situation was adequate. Drinks have greatly  improved. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I was very underwhelmed by south bound. 

After about an hour wait (made worse by their lack of wait management system and expecting all patrons to simply wait at the bar to be found...) we were finally seated. The drink well was constantly full while we were at the bar and when seated, our server was rarely present. Made me feel like this place was understaffed. 

On top of being understaffed, the staff were undertrained. Our server had no idea what the dishes on the menu were which just isn't acceptable for a menu with no explanation. No one ever brought us water until we asked about 30 mins in. When we finally did get our food (it took about 35 minutes for even the guac to come out) it was pretty bad. The guac is sub par, the tacos are average and the chilaquiles were DISGUSTING. Oh, and definitely don't get the mango tamales (those should be taken off the menu). I was appalled by the terrible service- and it didn't seem like anyone noticed or cared (probably the worst part). 

As far as positives go... the salsa bar is rad and full of yummy options, the decor is nice and the drinks are pretty good. Nowhere near enough to encourage me to go back though and I live across the street!"}
{"text":"Here we are: review update. Saturday afternoon and no one in the building.  The staff was extra friendly and on top of it this time, which is much appreciated-busy or not. They did away with the salsa bar and charging for the chips...great move.  The waitress brought out an array of salsa to choose from.  It was very good. 

They did away with the shrimp taco...boo.  It was one of my favs.  I ordered the machacha beef, pork, and fish.  They like the tacos high with toppings-good.  The tortilla is grilled..my company enjoyed them, but I thought it tasted burnt.  Fish: too much batter.  Beef: good flavor.  Pork: rubbery and fatty.  The street corn was tasty. So, I added a star for the salsa and complimentary chips.  It was cool they listened to our gripes.  But, I wish I would've loved the tacos like the first time.  

Oh well.  Maybe a bad day?  I may try again on taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"First of all, Ashley, our server was a super delight! Nice, helpful, attentive-everything you would want in a sever and more! Margaritas delicious! Food fresh and very tasty! The chips and salsa were delicious (both that my husband and I can enjoy-he's not a fan of spicy/hot, but I am).  I had the shrimp enchiladas and my husband had pork pastor burrito...both were super delicious, but as Ashley warned me, the shrimp enchiladas were spicy, it was no joke! I finished it, but my lips were on fire! Food/drinks/atmosphere/service are great! Definitely, check it out & keep the warning of the staff-they know best!"}
{"text":"Mediocre. Food wasn't bad but wasn't anything to brag about. The glasses they use are extremely tiny for water and such. Won't go wrong if you can't find anything else, just don't expect to be blown away."}
{"text":"I had wanted to come here when it first opened but avoided it due to bad reviews. I recently went on a Tuesday for the first time and was pleasantly surprised! I had no trouble finding a parking spot and was able to park right in their lot. It was too cold to sit outside but we had no problem getting a table inside. Tacos were only $2 and it was half off margarita pitchers. The service was on point! We never had to pour our own drinks from the pitcher. Our server was always close by but not in an obnoxious leave us alone way. The tacos were a lot better than I expected. I felt like they were smaller than a taco I would get at Hot Taco or Pacos but they tasted really good and I was full from two. Loved the atmosphere and can't wait to go back when it's warm and can take advantage of the great outdoor area!"}
{"text":"In the sea of the Charlotte taco scene, SouthBound just doesn't make the cut. I might go 2.5 stars here, but certainly not 3. 

Pros: our server was very kind, and could handle a large table well. The chips and salsa were on point, and they would refill your chips as often as you needed. The space itself is also very cool, and I love that they have UMAR art throughout the back wall. Someone at our table ordered the southbound Rita and said it was on point for a margarita. 

Cons: My salad was awful. The plate it was served on was WAY too small, and it was 90% romaine hearts. It was supposed to have black beans, corn and avacado on it, and I could have counted all those pieces on both my hands. I ordered the carne asada to go on top, and in retrospect, thank goodness it came on the side. The meat was mostly gristle and unbelieveably salty. My husband ordered the California burrito, and was told there were only a few French fries for \"crunch\". The burrito was about 50% fries, and there was no crunch, just soggy potato. Another person at our table ordered a Michelada, and it was just flavorless, and much more Clamato than beer. 

Overall, I tried it, but unless I hear that it's menu/seasonings/etc have changed for the better, I don't think we will be going back."}
{"text":"Great setup, they did a good job with decorating.
It was pretty slow when we where there .
Server was on point
But 2 out of the 3 dishes we ordered where returned because of the salt content 
The manager on duty was young and efficient 
The food that was too salty was comped and I hope that the cook back there took our criticism seriously and rectify the issue 
We will be back"}
{"text":"Pros:
Awesome ambiance 
Live music
Great for groups
The food is sort of California Mexican. Nothing amazing, but consistent and good. 
Margaritas on tap - get a pitcher!
Friendly waiters/waitresses

Cons:
Hardly any parking 
Hostess and management are not friendly

I've been here a few times. This place is a lot of fun for a group. There's often live music. There is a really great patio. Fun ambiance. Really great and casual spot! They have a small lot for parking but it fills up quickly and it's hard to find street parking. I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place looked really cool and a new hip joint, but I was mistaken when I came in. Food is WAY overpriced for the portions and what not, food was cold and took so long when there wasn't many people. Probably won't come back any time soon... maybe when the place grows and changes things. On a positive note, my bartender was amazing!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere but bad food and service. The open air concept and fun decor of this restaurant is a hit. Driving by it looks like an exciting place to eat. The food though leaves a lot to be desired. Worst guacamole I've ever had. Way worse than the first time I tried to make it myself. I think it was $10 for a tiny bowl too. The menu is lacking in food options. They also couldn't figure out how to make a quesadilla with corn tortillas (I'm gluten free), which is pretty easy to do by just switching the tortillas out. When we got there we couldn't find anyone to seat us so after a while we sat ourselves, then got scolded for doing so. Probably took 20 minutes to get out drinks and we didn't see our waitress again until our food came, then didn't see her again at all. Had to track the manager down to pay."}
{"text":"I'd driven by this place a few times and finally had the opportunity to stop in over the weekend. A friend was having a birthday and this was the spot they chose. So the atmosphere is cool. Very open layout and huge outdoor patio area. Our server was friendly and attentive! I ordered a couple tacos and they were a-ok. I tried the chicken mole and the carnitas tacos. Honestly, they tasted good but I couldn't tell which was which and I should because one is chicken and one is pork. Also, the draft beer selections were somewhat limited. I hope this place can get it together so it will stick around because it does have so much potential."}
{"text":"Cute set up, horrible food and margaritas. Service blahhhh, ceviche taste like Vinegar, margaritas taste like all line juice :( 
We tried it, THEY TRIED IT..... no go !"}
{"text":"Mehhhh. That's the one word way to describe SouthBound. It's fine, not great. 

We received good service on a Saturday afternoon, and we enjoyed the free chips and salsa. We tried tacos, a salad, and a burrito (which was huge). The food was fine but nothing special. 

The place is well decorated - string lights, many plants, bright colors. I think it would be a good place to get cocktails and enjoy the chips. They also have $2 taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"I've been patiently waiting to see what this place would open up to be while under construction. I instantly liked the vibe when we walked in. Low lighting to create an intimate atmosphere and plenty of spaced seating, but at angles so it's easy to make friends with others if you prefer. 
You'll notice a ton of tequila to choose from along the wall. AND- they have mezcal! (This is big for Charlotte, since the city runs off of Americanized Latin food.) The flavor of the food is that of what you would taste on the west coast or in Mexico. It's a bit pricey -but the bartender said that they might be looking into doing a Taco Tuesday to bring the folks in. 
I would highly recommend if you want to drink/eat and relax to chill reggae music."}
{"text":"As a women in the 21st century I am always searching for the perfect margarita. So you can understand my excitement when I found out a mexican restaurant was opening up a block away from my apartment. So I rounded up my friends & told them the first round was on me. We arrived and were told there would be a 25 minute wait, no biggie, but then we noticed three chairs opening up at the bar, \"SWEET\" thinking it's my lucky day. Boy was I wrong. Unfortunately I'll never know how the food tastes because my friends & I never got a chance to order. After waiting 15 minutes at the bar for a drink the big boobed brunette finally greeted us, I'm pretty sure I could of had a more intelligent conversation with the women tattooed on her arm because she had not a clue how to answer any of our menu questions. So we decided to not eat & just get a drink. Well I paid way too much for a specialty margarita made with top shelf tequila and store bought sour mix. I could have done that myself for half the price and twice the amount of alcohol. Sorry I won't be back. There are just way to many disappointing factors from our experience. But don't worry I saved the night by making some delicious blackened fish tacos and fresh squeezed OJ & Lime margaritas. Thanks for nothing"}
{"text":"Updating my review to reflect the disappointing service we got last weekend! I was excited to take some visiting family there for a casual lunch, but 10 minutes in to lunch I was regretting my decision. our poor server seemed so lost and in such a daze... we had a couple kids with us, and we ordered the simplest food for them at the start, but their grilled cheeses were the last to come to the table. quite pointless because by then they filled up on our food and the chips and guac! the drink order was messed up too, but the food was consistent to my last visit! hoping this was a one time thing, but i'll probably wait it out a bit before going back."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. How you can make a chicken rice bowl taste bad?  Someone please explain why the queso tasted like movie theatre butter? There are so many good places in the south end area and this is not one to go to. You're way better off walking next door to the Taco Bell, and that'll leave you satisfied. #neveragainbound"}
{"text":"This place was so good came here for late lunch at 2:30pm. On the patio in secret vip couch in the corner is where we sat. It's kids friendly with our three year old. We had 2 entrees steak and half of chicken. The good was fresh, good, and different I love restaurants and love good service. My husband mentioned bbq sauce and the manager Kelly ran over to the owners other restaurant and brought back homemade bbq sauce from Macs. After 9 years of being in Clt eating at every restaurant, hands down this was the best service ever. Thank you for your consideration Kelly!"}
{"text":"SouthBound started off on the wrong food. I'm not saying that because I went and had a bad experience, but I am saying that because the bad experiences of others kept The Lady and I from checking this place out. It's true - I'm sure we weren't the only ones. It was plagued, and it's super duper unfortunate, because we had a GREAT experience there.

The Lady and I just closed on a house (YAY!) and we went out to celebrate. SouthBound sounded like a perfect option - it was a nice night for an open air type place, and they had a while to fix things up... alright, I'll bite!

And bite, yelp readers, we did. Chips and salsa are complimentary (almost Moe's like chips with a smokey salsa, free refills on both), but there are of course queso and guac options if you so desire. Instead of apps, we spent our money on a $26 pitcher of their house margarita, which was really refreshing and had a great balance of sweet, sour, and boozy. Poured into small glasses, we both were probably able to fill up 3 or 4 times each. You kinda get to the point where you're like \"oh, you've taken 2 sips? LEMME TOP THAT FOR YOU\".

For our main courses, I ordered the Adobo Chicken Quesadilla, which was flavorful, fresh, and filling. I even liked the pineapple that was on it! The dish comes with a decent side of charro beans alongside some pico and guac to add on. Everything jived really well flavor-wise, and at $9, it was uber affordable and would definitely recommend to people. 

The intangibles: Service was AWESOME; our waitress was perfect. Food came out extremely quickly to our surprise, and again, everything was fresh. Atmosphere is also on-point, I love the colors, decor, music, and how open the whole thing is. Noise level wasn't an issue. I don't see how our visit could be made any better hence the 5 stars, but I know now that there's nothing to be afraid of. It's all good in the SouthBound neighborhood :)"}
{"text":"I stopped by alone after an exciting Friday night trip to Lowes and snagged a seat at the bar. 
Ended up spending $30 before tip for 2 margaritas, small guac/chips App + 2 tacos. 
House margs are on tap - premixed with fresh juices - so they're consistent and pretty tasty. 
Most draft beers seem to be 12 oz which seems tiny but perhaps the price reflects that?
$3 tacos were alright, kind of like a shot of taco with no sides or anything. Bartender talked me into tacos instead of a plate which was fine but I might have enjoyed the side of beans. 
Guac was tasty accompanied by thin salty chips which are my kryptonite. 
Overall, I would lean toward here over Bakersfield, but not by a huge margin. It'll be better once the newness wears off and it's not so loud / crowded."}
{"text":"Wish I could give 0 stars. Horrible menu, NO QUESO, horrible drinks (they literally served me a cheap beer in a paper bag), and advised us against ordering their own guac which was the only appealing thing on the menu. They directed us to their \"salsa\" bar and it was a variety of soup-looking substances in Mcdonald's ketchup cups. We left immediately at the sight of our drinks. So disappointed, the ambiance is great but the menu and everything else is terrible."}
{"text":"The negative reviews don't tell truth....

....It's far worse than that.  

I held off of trying this place given the bad reviews.  I wanted to give the place time to get the kinks worked out.  The sun will go supernova before this house of mediocrity gets its shit together.  

Never. Again. Ever. 

Showed up on a Tuesday evening.  Was told it was a 40 minute wait.  At least 40% of the tables were open.  Huh?

We went to the bar.  After waiting 20 minutes to get a drink, our sickly sweet margaritas showed up. They sucked.  The shot specials that we ordered never showed.  More on these \"specials\" later. We had intended to eat at the bar.  But the service was so horrible we decided to wait for a table.  

After asking to close out the bar tab four times, I finally got my bill.  The bartender could not have been more oblivious.  

Oh....now onto the food.  

Chips.  Damn good. Really good.  Yes, this is one thing this place has going for it.... other than the atmosphere.  I forgot to mention that.  The space is super cool. Too bad everything else sucks a big fat uncircumcised one.  One that hasn't been washed in a long time. With a lot of schmeg.  Yup, it's that tasty.  So if you have a hankering schmeggy cock cuisine, the purveyors of shit on a plate at SouthBound have got you covered!

The service - Again Slow. As. Shit.  

So. Bad. 

Tacos - 2 good. 4 bleh. Nope, not bringing me back. 

Bill comes.  The $3 shots of Herradura silver were actually $2 off of the exorbitant price of $11.  So, $9, 3x what we were told the price was.  

To sum it up:  Fuck this shit place.  Fuck the shit service.  Fuck the shit food."}
{"text":"Nice vibe. Cool place. Blandest food I've ever eaten. Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out on the large and festive patio SoCal style. Good price for good food and drinks."}
{"text":"Boy, I really wanted to love this place and everything fell short.

A casual Saturday night out, we thought SouthBound would be the perfect place for tacos and margs. With a welcoming inside and colorful decor, I was convinced that *this* was it. 

I don't remember our waiter making any suggestions and we let him know we were newcomers, but it didn't seem to change his attitude or the service. I felt like we were constantly waiting for something, salsa, water, hot sauce, the check...

I'd like to tell you about how fantastic the tacos/entrees were but that's where the rubber hits the road on this review. Again everything fell short, and I'll spare the details but I got deathly ill a few hours after our dining experience at SouthBound. 

With my love for tacos and tequila, I will never stop eating that Mexi-Cali grub I love so much, but I won't be coming back to SouthBound or recommending it to anyone I know."}
{"text":"Having read all the reviews I was definitely hesitant, but wanted to give Southbound a try.
We arrived around 8:00 and were seated in one of the last booths inside.
We were greeted by our very friendly waitress. She brought water and chips and salsa, which are now complimentary...which is a change since they opened. It was Tuesday so we ordered a pitcher of Margaritas, 1/2 price on Tuesday.
We started we the Carne Asada Fries and Queso dip. Both were amazing, so a good start to the meal.
Unfortunately the meal, tacos and quesadillas weren't so good. The meat was dry or fatty and all really lacked in flavor.
Overall, great spot, decor and location. Appetizers were great but as for a meal not sure I would rush back.
Definitely glad to see chips and salsa are now complimentary!"}
{"text":"Went here shortly after opening and was really underwhelmed with the food (the atmosphere and drinks I give 5 out of 5 stars though - will definitely be back for that!). Came back again this week and had a much better experience with the staff and the dinner items, and seems like chips are free now too. Everything I've had with carne (steak) was really good. Drinks are reasonably priced as well (try the Michelada). They said they'd be revealing their new menu Friday so I'll definitely be back to check it out.  Glad to see they are considering feedback!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what concept the owner is trying to play here but it's not working. The first thing I noticed when coming in on Sunday afternoon is that there's almost no one there. Why? According to the bartender its because there are no Tv's and the Panthers were playing. He mentioned there are few people in on Saturday afternoons either because of college football and no TVs. Conversely, Mac's next door, with lots of Tv's, was packed. Im not saying they should have loads of tvs because its not a sports bar. But a 60 inch in each corner with the sound turned down would keep the sports fans from walking away. I would also note that this place has no draft beer, no local brews at all. Finally, its really bright. Too bright. Theres very little ambiance here. Its just straight up boring. To the owner id say this: this is the South End of Charlotte. Its not Uptown. Sports and beer is what goes on here. Maybe add a live band a few nights a week? Make it more fun and lively. If you dont do something soon you should plan on a bankruptcy filing."}
{"text":"The shrimp cocktail is very unique but amazing! It's not your regular shrimp cocktail. My boyfriend had a carne asada plate and said that it was solid. I had three tacos, veggie, steak and beef. All were very good flavor and enough to fill me up. I got a margarita and it was delicious  not too sweet. We were with a very large party so service was a little chaotic but I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have been anticipating the opening of this place for awhile. We passed by to ask one of the managers \"bald head blue eyes\" a few questions. He may have been the rudest person I've ever encountered in the service industry. He brings a negative name towards your company, I even asked other employees about him and they said he's always like that.. i will never go back nor recommend anyone I know to go"}
{"text":"Casual place, love the outside/covered dinning area, good people watching with South blvd right there. 
Solid taco's for lunch, I went for the pork, seafood, shrimp and carnitas. The pork was a little dry but overall the flavors were delicious. There was good crunch with the lettuce and the tomato's, you could tell were fresh because my corn taco wasn't drenched in water. My favorite was the shrimp and seafood. 
Added bonus is the salsa bar, 6 different types and flavors in various levels of heat. Also, having Pacifico on draft is a nice touch, it tasted very good in the NC sun."}
{"text":"Didn't know this place was opened until I got invited out for lunch and then heard that it had just recently opened. The restaurant was very packed but server was fast so it didn't take long at all to be seated, order, or get our food and drinks. The atmosphere was very nice and I love the setup. We tried a number of things including the guacamole (could have had a little more flavor), the Mexican corn (pretty good), the cucumber salad (can't go wrong with that), the Carne Asada taco (steak cooked to perfection in that taco) and the Baja fish taco (the chipotle crema sauce makes it, I even added a little more. I do with that they listed what was on each taco so I didn't have to ask especially with it comes to sauces but other then that it's a pretty cool spot but not my first choice for tacos."}
{"text":"Went to SouthBound on a Tuesday to try out the Sangria special and the $2 tacos. OKAY PEOPLE, LISTEN UP - this is my new favorite sangria. It was light, fruity, and bubbly. I loved it! I would have gone for a second pitcher if the Uber to Concord was cheaper. ANYWAY...

I also tried one of the $2 tacos. I had the steak taco and it was great! I had the option of flour or corn tortilla. Went with the corn... duhh.

I love the atmosphere inside. It's really open, trendy, fun-feeling. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Oh boy.. I thought people were being sarcastic about these ratings. But here we go. I'm going to keep it short and blunt. I only came here because it's down the street from my job and I wanted to review this myself.

PROS
-FANTASTIC indoor and outdoor space. Would be great for events or live music.
-Their house tequila is Lunazul, which actually isn't bad at all!
-Service was great, bartender was nice.
-The margarita got me a little tipsy.

CONS
-Chips and salsa. The salsa was non-tasting. But It was just something to put on my chips. Period.
-The tacos were absolutely bland as hell. I ordered the beef, fish, steak, and vegetarian tacos. None of them had a difference in taste, except for the steak taco. It tasted like it survived a house fire.
-The paper straws. They're great at first because they're firm and seem like it won't be a bothersome. The more you drink, the soggier the straw gets.. so finish your drink quickly.
-I think they use a pre-mixed margarita with Lunazul. If this is supposed to be So-Cal.. I'm sorry, but you can't use a pre-made mix. Just make it.
-Just overall bland food. Very very bland. 
-Parking is a trip. I know it's south end, but they need to move the tables and chairs from that space because it's valuable space to park. As we speak, I'm literally parked in between a table and a set of three chairs on either side.

Will I come here again? Meh... maybe if a friend has a party here, but I'd try to make them have it somewhere else. The bartender was nice. Great space. But I'm glad I got to experience it for myself."}
{"text":"Will not be returning after tonight's experience. As a manager in the service industry the service I received this evening was poor. I arrived at about 9:30pm (they closed at 11pm) was promptly seated on the patio upon request. I was not greeted by a server nor manager for about 15min. After my party arrived it took another 10min for our server to come to the table and take our order. Our food arrived without silverware, napkins, or refills on drinks. We were halfway through our dinner when Hannah (our server) asked if everything was acceptable. We had to ask another server who was more than helpful for the missing items and to find Hannah, who was nowhere to be found. The only time she was attentive when it was time to close out our checks. It was not a busy evening and there was no reason for the service I received. I even passed this information along to a manger and they did nothing but talk down about his employee. I enjoy the ambiance of Southbound, but will not be returning due to the disappointing customer service I experienced."}
{"text":"This is the worst service I have ever had. They made  me several different margaritas and when I ordered the normal house one each time they continued to get worse with each one. This place has zero management skills and their staff and management were unhelpful and they are completely disorganized. They will need an ops efficiency expert to improve their process and procedures but they are absolutely terrible right now..

I would highly recommend never coming back to this facility to anyone and I will make it a point to ensure no one else comes here.


Food and drinks were sub par and the drinks were not correct at any time I ordered them as regular margs and they came out as god knows what. They lag time from drink order to food order was you acceptable at best."}
{"text":"Mixed Review-

The  atmosphere overall is phenomenal. When I was there I really did feel like I was in  a cool beach bar in a small Mexican town. (5 stars)

The bar was very good. I didn't get any signature drinks but the beers were a decent deal, came out quickly and the bar had a nice atmosphere.  (4 stars)

Food- This is where they lost me (and others). Yikes. So the menu itself requires a lot of verbal explanation from the servers/bartenders because it just lists a single word (often in Spanish) for the dish. Half of the dishes aren't what you would normally find on a menu at a place like Bakersfield or Sabor so you find yourself requiring guidance. This place has only been open for a few weeks- I get it- but the servers/bartenders didn't know anything about the menu. That's fine... I ordered some tacos, guac and other items. Guac is a joke- there is no other way to describe it. Tacos were mediocre. Carnitas were badly overcooked/dry. Burrito was good (I would get again). Overall the food wasn't executed with a lot of finesse, but it wasn't inedible. My wife's food never came out (they never put it in) so who knows how the salad and street corn is. (1 Star)

I'll be back again since this place is a few blocks from my house and the bar is excellent, but I won't be targeting this as a food destination, which honestly, is fine."}
{"text":"Southbound:  The Waffle House of Mexican Food

I'm not even sure where to begin. When I heard how crappy the food and drink has been at Southbound it just didn't seem to register with me. How could a place with such a cool atmosphere that invested so much into this new hip spot suck so bad?

This past Saturday night my wife and another couple thought we'd stop in and give it a try. \"New and improved menu\" we heard. And really, I just didn't believe the people who said all you're really paying for is nice decor in a cool spot in Southend. I ordered the California Burrito. Either: 1) the owner or chef hates California and they are attempting to defame the Golden State; or 2) they ran out of ingredients the night we were there and ran across the street to the 7-Eleven and grabbed as many prepackaged burritos as they could to try and pass them off on the patrons. A dry, doughy wrap coupled with grizzly, chewy beef led to the discovery of a new diet: The Southbound special. Three bites and you're done eating for the entire night!

My wife ordered the churros. She grew up in Texas so when she said they were \"average at best,\" I believe her.

I have to hand it to our waitress, who was really friendly and helped take a number of items off our bill (hey, the canned beer was good, so they've got that going for them). When I told her that Southbound should consider revamping its entire theme and consider going with \"The Waffle House of Mexican Food\" she actually seemed really receptive to this idea. Think about it: all the new development going on in Southend. No real trashy, late-night watering hole where you can toss a few back, get some crappy food and if a few people throw up on the floor on their way out no one will give a second look. I say run with it. Send some employees to do some price comparisons at 7-Eleven once a week. Better yet, head the other way and order a bunch of items from Taco Bell, sit down with the entire staff and try to reverse engineer what they are doing. Taco Bell may actually have seen a spike in revenue and visitors since Southbound opened.

One final point:  the manager on duty this past Saturday evening was a complete and total dick. I get it. You hate life right now. You've probably had to apologize to hundreds of patrons who can't stomach the food here. Really bro, I feel you. But at least try. Consider apologizing or putting forth the least amount of effort to try and get us to come back. Instead, after hearing from our waitress that we were not happy with our meals, this dickhead came to our table and circled it while giving everyone a stern stare-down as if he was Hulk Hogan about to step into the ring with Andre the Giant prior to Wrestlemania III.  So yeah, Southbound is pretty much dead to me.

Advice: scrap the whole team and start over. Consider the \"Waffle House of Mexican Food\" theme and run with it. At this point the only thing I'm looking forward to in regard to Southbound is which new restaurant will take its place when it finally shuts its doors."}
{"text":"I was surprised with how much I did enjoy southbound. The reviews are so mixed, I didn't know what to expect. The tacos were surprisingly flavorful. I enjoyed the guacamole even though I wanted the quest, but our server was so quick to refer the guacamole when I asked her which one she recommended. The only thing I had an issue with was the tap cocktail. I ordered the margarita and it was bitter and clearly missing the agave. Aside from that, the experience was pretty good. I would go back. Taco Tuesday's are a great sell"}
{"text":"I read the reviews before coming here and should have made my decision to stay away then but a trusted friend said this place was good and I need to give it a try.

I showed up for Taco Tuesday on a Tuesday evening. The dining room was busy so I looked to the bar which was not very busy when I got there, only 4 seats occupied.

I was handed a food menu and a drink menu. I was disappointed to see that there were no local beers offered. Mexican-ish beers only. What's is Mexican about Stone? Disappointing but this wasn't where disappointent ended.

I ordered 4 tacos. They arrived quickly so great job by the kitchen staff. But what I was missing was napkins and silverware. I waited for the bartender to come to my end of the bar. Took 7 minutes exactly. No napkins on this end of the bar. They were all on the other end. But still no silverware. I understand tacos are eaten with your hands but what about what drops on the plate?

The tacos were ok. The flavors popped when I added the lime. While I was eating, 2 couples sat down on either side of me and were served chips and salsa. Funny, I wasn't offered that. After I was done eating my tacos, I asked the bartender about the chips and salsa and he said he would get me some. I said I'm done eating now. It would have been nice to have them before or with my meal. All I wanted was my check and to get out now.

This was my first visit here. Nothing was explained to me as to how the restaurant works. The bartender didn't explain why they didn't have local beer. And considering they are owned by the same people as Mac's Speed Shop next door who has a good craft beer selection, i just found this odd that they didn't continue it here. Also, what's the deal with the chips and salsa? Do people have to ask? It's not on the menu so I assume it is apparently complimentary. And finally is there a shortage on napkins and silverware here?

I left, paying cash and barely leaving a tip. Not impressed at all. Before coming here, I debated on a real Mexican place and Taco Bell. Either would have been better than this."}
{"text":"1 Star for location & atmosphere 
1 Star for service


Guac was okay, but the portion for $9 was not worth it. I got the carne asade steak, al pastor steak, & street corn. Total for the tacos and corn was about $13... go to Sabor Latin Street Grill for way better tacos and street corn. The portion was good, but the flavor was not. Ordered the strawberry mule for $10 & it was also meh. My friend ordered the pear mojito and it was so meh she didn't even finish drinking it. Go and maybe order a beer and enjoy the cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"We have now been twice in the last two weeks. Chips, salsa and guacamole are all stand-out. Baja fish tacos are excellent and the arugula salad with chicken is a legit entree salad with a light but flavorful dressing. SouthBound is definitely a new member of my rotation."}
{"text":"I was very much looking forward to visiting this restaurant as the pre-opening hype was very exciting and favorable.  I was quite disappointed--mostly around the margaritas and food. Based on hearing the bartender from the Punch Room was now working there, I expected the margaritas to be hand crafted and not taste like a pre-mix.  I tried two have the margaritas -- the house margarita, and the Cadillac.  I found neither of them very good.  Relative to the food, I ordered three tacos with the homemade corn tortillas.   The corn tortillas were delicious.  However the carne asada was very fatty and the pork didn't even taste like pork.  The shrimp taco out of the three that I ordered, was the best.  The waitress was not very knowledgeable, and it took her quite some time to wait on us, probably about 15 minutes after we were seated. On a positive note, the atmosphere is very cool!    From my perspective, I recommend it as a place to enjoy a beer or two and some chips and guacamole."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Super friendly staff, great ambiance, and hands down the best tacos/margaritas I've had outside of Mexico! 100% recommend."}
{"text":"Super cool spot with underwhelming food. Got the queso fundido. Looked like something from applebees. Margarita was meh. Hot taco has better and just as big of margaritas for $2. Such a shame for such a cool restaurant. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"It's been 7 months since Southbound opened and immediately lost my business. I was ready to try again tonight and see where things have gone. I was pleasantly surprised and am happy to upgrade my score from a borderline 2 to a solid 4. I went on Taco Tuesday and their selection of tacos included was impressive. I tried four different tacos and enjoyed them all. Our waiter was happy and eager to help us, although the restaurant being busy caused a rather long wait for our dinner. Despite the wait we remained entertained by our bottomless chips and excellent house salsa which were much needed in the first visit. Other corrections from the initial opening include the elimination of the scary and hazardous salsa bar, as well as a new detailed menu which explains exactly what you're about to order. 

I greatly commend the management, and most likely the owner, for listening to the customers' concerns and critiques to better the establishment. I look forward to returning in the near future."}
{"text":"Two words can sum up the food at this place \"zero flavor.\" Let's start with the guacamole, I think they may just crush up an avocado because there's nothing else in it. It lacks any kind of flavor, it's boring and bland. 

We had the Carne Asada taco- it was literally flavorless. I don't know how that's possible but they pulled it off. 

Tried a fish taco, this one lacked flavor as well.  They must use zero seasoning it's bizarre. Tried the shrimp taco, came with 2 tiny pieces of shrimp. 

All and all this place leaves a lot to be desired. Bland flavorless food and very small portions. 

The only good thing about this place is the atmosphere, but even that won't get me back."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to sit outside!!!  Food is excellent - our server was stellar (Brittney), and we will definitely be back!  I highly recommend the Boundless Burro beverage and my husband loved the Carne Asada taco.  Will be a perfect location to eat with friends this fall!!!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place! The previous reviews are right, the portions are tiny, and honestly nothing was great. Didn't have cocktails but those looked pretty good - so maybe that's a good reason to go?
I read an article that the owner or chef said Charlotteans were expecting Mexican and that's why we're upset, but I was expecting SoCal tacos and was let down. Having been to SoCal, and eaten tacos, I think I know the difference."}
{"text":"Hmmmm. Things that make you go hmmmm. Southbound was one of those things. A couple of times passing in this area i always noticed they are super packed especially now since the weather is nice. We went one night and since it was rainy most people were definitely inside the establishment. Food, was mediocre, margaritas, mediocre as well. So besides the surroundings this place really didn't excite me the way i just knew it would. My boyfriend made a good point, when i asked him how did he like his food and what did he think? His response was im not really a fan of going to Mexican restaurants where the cooks,etc are not Mexican. Funny but kind of true the more you think about it. I wont completely shut this place down im sure ill give them another try over the summer."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I can't accurately review the food here, only the service. Why's that you ask? Because the service is so bad that I don't get to try the food. The first time I went, it was before their menu revamp and I was underwhelmed by the food but extra annoyed by their level of service. I mean seriously it was a Monday at noon, it shouldn't take 1.5 hours for lunch. 

Over the next couple of months, so many people kept raving about the food and trying to convince me to go. Since I'm easily peer pressured, I thought \"why not?\" 

Should have stuck to my gut. I went on a Thursday at 1 and despite the place being half empty, no one came to talk to us for over 20 minutes. Look, I'm all about extending my lunch break but at least give me a water while I'm sitting there. I got the attention of a waitress and was told it would only be another minute. Welp. Many minutes later, still nothing. 

I am not the kind of person who walks out of a restaurant. In fact, it makes me pretty uncomfortable to do so. But I left Southbound and am pretty sure that no one even noticed. 

I've heard good things about the food, but no food is worth waiting 30 minutes to be even acknowledged."}
