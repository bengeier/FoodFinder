{"text":"Rock and Roll Patio had opened only a few days before I visited, and it exhibited some of that soft opening awkwardness I expected.  But there's a lot to like about R&RP.  Their menu is pretty abbreviated...a few hamburgers, corndog, and rice bowls.  They mentioned something about trying out new items, so I'm guessing the menu will expand at some point  The restaurant appears to be operated and staffed by the owners.  The Rock and Roll theme seems a little odd, but this isn't a place I would go to for the theme, anyhow.  The patio is cute, although it does feel a bit \"exposed\" right on the very busy 7th Street.  But let's get to the food.  The mushroom burger was very tasty, with great fresh ingredients.  The buns are really good, and the burger cooked just right.  The fries, which the owner mentioned he cuts fresh every morning, were good, more for the seasoning than the fries themselves.  They didn't come out as crispy as I like, but the potato flavor you get from fresh potatoes is definitely present.  I also tried a corndog, which tasted good.  It's hard to make a corndog anything truly special, but the dog tasted like a good beef dog, and the \"corn\" tasted right.  Prices are very reasonable, $5.00 gets you a good sized hamburger with fries.  I'll go to R&R Patio again when I'm in the mood for a fast-food burger prepared with local care and fresh ingredients."}

{"text":"they are closed  now and got bought up by two hippies, good thing my last trip there i got served seriously a raw burger patty...needless to say i didnt finish my meal and wont be back."}
{"text":"I will never cook a burger at home again...at least, not when this place is open.  These are those burgers you have to cut in half and open your mouth as wide as possible to get a bite!  My favorite?  The BBQ Mushroom Swiss with grilled onions and I have them add bacon.  Dear God!  The buns?  Manna from heaven!  NOTHING like you get anywhere else.  The fries are hand cut, thin, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and salty seasoning that is crazy yummy.  They also have rice bowls that are BIG servings.  Kids love the corn dogs.  This is a new place...just over a month old...and I've eaten there 2-3 times already.  Owners are young guys, 19 and 20, AND live in the area.  We ought to get out there and support them!  The weather is gorgeous for outdoor dining and they tell me they have one of those tall space heaters when it's cooler.  I'll be back!  Give them a try!"}
{"text":"I have tried a lot of burger joints in the area, and this one is by far the best. $5 and change gets you a huge burger, fresh-cut fries and a can of soda.   Operated by the owners, they definitely deserve the support of the community. Coming back tomorrow... And the next day... And probably after that. Also do yourself a favor and get the BBQ Mushroom & Swiss. Perfect ratio of sauce to burger to shrooms."}
