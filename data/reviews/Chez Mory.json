{"text":"Mory's vegetarian pizza is probably one of the worst in the city. All it was , was raw un-marinated , un-spiced bland vegetables in the middle . Money wasted as I didn't  even taste a bite."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the west island! Also the lowest price ! 2 for 1 always ! Very fast and courteous delivery! They made a mistake on my order, delivered the wrong pizzas, but 1 phone call and 15 minutes later I got my order delivered to me at no extra charge ! Excellent customer service, I highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is your average 2 for 1 pizza joint located in a strip mall. I had heard great things about their pizza and was excited to try it but it was a little underwhelming. Not bad pizza at all, just didn't wow me. We tried the vegetarian and the cheese pizza. The vegetarian was very generous with the olives as you can see in the picture but it was almost too generous, and this coming from someone who loves olives! I much preferred the cheese pizza, which had the perfect amount of cheese and the pizza sauce balanced it out really well. The crust on their pizzas does tend to be thicker than most other pizza places and the sesame seed crust was a nice touch. In the future, I'd stick to the classic cheese pizza if ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Absolute worst experience I've ever had ordering a pizza in my life. I call at 9:30pm to order a pizza. Their website states they close at 10pm. The girl on the phone tells me they're close. I kindly state it's 9:30. So she says that they stop taking orders at 9:30. In that case their website should state they close at 9:30 not 10. Anyhow back and forth as I tell her ok it's 9:30 then you can take my order. She keeps repeating they stop taking orders at 9:30 and I keep repeating it's 9:30!!  She then puts me on hold and after waiting for 5 minutes a man comes on the phone and tells me the same thing she says. I then tell him you close at 10 and I called at 9:30. He gets extremely rude with me to a point where he starts screaming.  I've never seen anything like this in my life. I order pizza all the time and just moved to the west island. It's really unfortunate as I will never ever order from them again and make sure everyone I know doesn't either."}
{"text":"Tasty pizza! I especially like the bacon well done with extra cheese. They have sesame crusts and it is a different and very nice touch."}
