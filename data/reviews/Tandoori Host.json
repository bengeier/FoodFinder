{"text":"Ordered chicken biryani yesterday for lunch to go.  Got home and found out there was NO CHICKEN in the chicken biryani. Just plain rice. On top of that the rice was drenched in oil.   Could not eat it.  Worst chicken biryani in all of GTA.  Very disappointed.  I will not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"Simply outstanding food. I'm not sure why this place is listed as closed, but it is most certainly open. The naan is to die for and their kebabs are outstanding. To top it off, this is possibly the friendliest place in Vaughan. My new go-to spot for Tandoori!"}
{"text":"The owners here are always so friendly and welcoming. Best garlic naan and butter chicken around. An order of that with chicken biryani is my usual. Definitely give it a try."}
