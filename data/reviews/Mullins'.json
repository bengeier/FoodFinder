{"text":"Went for brunch Jan. 7/12.  Will not go again. Coffee is $2.50 a cup and no free refills, and it wasn't good coffee...better to walk across to Star Bucks!  Food was average but not enough @ $7.00 1 slice of toast, 2 small eggs, 1 sausage, and a small amount of home fries. The top of the ketchup bottle brought to the table had ketchup all over it.  Makes me wonder what the kitchen must like.  Going to Sneaky Dees next time.  The real highlight was the Costco salt grinder."}
{"text":"We're on holiday and loved this local pub. Decent food. Good drinks. Local color. Regulars and staff are friendly. Good example of neighborhood pub. Nice atmosphere. Doors/wall open to street in nice weather. Good for people watching."}
{"text":"We came here with a relatively large group (11) as part of a pub crawl and was greeted by a rude waitress right away informing us there was no capacity to accommodate us, after which she turned around and left. There were empty tables right around us and in witnessing the awkward rejection, some nice patrons voluntarily moved around to help seat us. Given their gesture, it becomes almost rude for us to take off at that point. After sitting down, the waitress brought one drink menu, muttering something about \"as you already know we're busy tonight, so there's one menu for all of you guys\". At this point we may as well have just left.  However, we decided to order a round of tequila shots just so we show gratitude towards the other customers that so kindly moved for us. She brought us the drinks in a s sloppy manner, plop it down on the table and walked away.  While I'm not proud, we didn't tip her, to which she responded with a \"seriously?\". I'm sorry lady but what exactly were you expecting??  The bar seems fine, the service is the worst I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"Nice little local spot t o grab a drink! Friendly staff place is clean :)"}
{"text":"One of the BEST locations for trainspotting that I've found in this part of the city.  If you are lucky enough to snag one of the coveted north-facing window seats, you will be treated to the Eastbound 506-Carlon streetcars making regular stops just a few feet from where you're sitting!  If you are late to the party and must sit at the bar, there is still a clear view... and its been my personal experience that if you sit and stare long enough the patrons who are sitting in the window will generally be kind enough to offer you a seat.  If you love admiring transit trains as much as I do, you will surely not be disappointed."}
{"text":"No atmosphere, cold and manager an anger Irishman.  This stretch of College needs something better than this joint."}
{"text":"This place is great. The service was on key and the pints were good for $5. I recommend this place to anyone that wants to go enjoy a beer and feel like a local."}
{"text":"A nice hearty Irish pub in the heart of Little Italy. This new place is where The Cornerstone used to be, and in many ways, takes up its predecessors mantle with ease.   You'll find a fairly typical line of draughts there, all in the $7 range, which is a bit more than I would like cost-wise but nothing crazy. The menu is also typical, with lots of the regular pub snacks that make locals like these so easy. I should note that the \"Specials\" board this Friday boasted a fine list of stews - and even with cold weather coming, I still doffed my cap to them for putting stews out there as the siren to lure customers. I mean, stew is good and all, I just don't know how many people are walking down College Street on a Friday night thinking, \"man, could I ever get my stew on right now.\" [note: it also gives the place pretty good UK credibility]  Which is just to say - it's that kind of place. A real, proper UK corner pub that you would happily call your local. The food was great, the beer taps clean and the service fantastic.   Frankly, this place would have easily been a 5-Star for me based mostly on geography (not always the best measure - see Toby's) if it weren't for the niggling cost of beer. I don't mean to be such a stooge, but the thing about locals is that it should be a place you can go and grab an easy pint when the whistle blows. And by whistle blowing, I mean my Entourage calendar dinging to let me know I'm done. Regardless - a general unwritten rule should really be that if you're a pub, you should have a $5 pint. It doesn't matter what the beer is [note: Sun Draught Lager forever!] but there should be a cheap option that allows people to come in and watch the game without breaking the bank.  Laura and I ate for $50 all in. That was two fantastic dinners [the meatloaf was particularly amazing] and three pints, including a pint of magner's cider, which is tough to come by, and the regular tip. So if I'm droning on about cost, I think that bill indicates that you should take it with a grain of salt.   This is a good place and I look forward to frequenting it in the months and years to come. Now just serve me a cheap pint and I'll be a total convert!!"}
{"text":"Mullins on College St. is fairly new and adds to the tapestry of the strip that funnels you on your way into Little Italy. It has a neighbourhood feel and is sized perfectly for a cozy drink at the bar with some wings for a snack. The basketball game was on the big TVs which could be a distraction from a conversation so keep that in mind if you're expecting the famed Irish tradition of standing room only and blabbing to your mates for entertainment rather than the subtle blue glare of the big screens along with sports commentary dominating the evening."}
{"text":"A bit disappointed - I love the Duke pubs, where the food is decent.  This place is a bit barren, and the food was subpar. The fries especially were cold.  Plus what is up with the interim menu?"}
{"text":"This Mullins does not have the charm of the Bay and Wellesley location. Service semeed a bit more brisk, and the table they sat us in was right under a leaky pipe... gross."}
{"text":"* cute and personable bartender * cheap drinks, fun time  bartender was from ireland, made the bar feel a little more authentic. she was waitressing and bussing the bar by herself. Personable and really great conversations, she was also probably the best looking waitress of the bars I'd been to that night. $3 well drinks and we're all sold. Good number of people at this one. I'd make it part of the college st. bar crawl."}
{"text":"It's an Irish bar, as far as I'm concerned an Irish bar is an international embassy of fun and this place lives up to that."}
{"text":"Not a great pub, drinks were cheap. Staff were a bit too cheeky, drinks were always $9 but instead of giving a $10 note and a $1 try always gave a $5 and 3 $2s I thought this was acceptable but after ordering 5 rounds I started to get aggravated that they never give me $1 hence I was always tipping 2.  Also my girlfriend asked for a Caesar and was told they weren't making them even though another person was drinking one.  Would not recommend this for an Irish bar!"}
{"text":"Patio is tiny and uneven, hold on to your drank cuz it WILL slide off the table. When you go inside you're basically teleported to Ireland, plenty of drunk Irish lads to go around ladies!! Problems with dating in Toronto? Go to Mullins'"}
{"text":"Came here for late night drinks with a buddy - selection of beer on tap was pretty good, and bartender made some good suggestions. If you're looking for some munchies, I'd definitely recommend the nachos, HUGE serving!   Drinks are well priced and the atmosphere was what you'd expect in a pub downtown. Give it a shot if you're around!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a late night Guinness. Friendly staff, friendly barflies, great tunage. #DoIt"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Red head bartender was so cold to us. Demolished a sandwich behind the bar before serving anyone haha. Spoke down to the other patrons around us. Made us feel so uncomfortable we left. Will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"Irish pub paints a certain imagine in peoples mind, for me it's relaxed people, beer, and fun. Mullin's doesn't seem to fit that profile.  Ordered a mixed drink at the bar instead of beer and it tasted fine. Nothing exceptional, and reasonably priced,  ~ $6.   I asked for napkins and it really took a while. Bartender grabbed the napkins and got carried away chatting with someone else while holding onto my napkins. The bill also took a while even though the bar is just that big (aka very small).  The place itself is icky. I wouldn't want to sit at any of the tables if I was wearing anything decent. The floor almost feels sticky, and this is not on a busy night. The washroom however is decent compared to the bar that is set by the place."}
{"text":"Mullins' Pub is a wee spot at the corner of College St and Euclid Ave. It's the type of place that practically screams \"Local Pub\", down to the modest decor, simple menu and bright-eyed, smiling staff. You can pull up to the bar for a pint or grab a warm meal at one of the four large booths with pew-style seating. With two TVs playing sports and Q107 blaring on the radio this place is fella-oriented. No bellinis to be found on the menu.  I came here for lunch. I was given an \"interim menu\", though I'm not entirely sure what that means. Are they between menus? Cooks? Either way it had your standard pub fare like fries, poutine, onion rings, chicken fingers, etc. I opted for the Famous Baked Wings. \"Famous\" because they said so, and \"baked\" because they are. A pound ran me $9.99, and they were meaty and flavourful and heavy on the sauce. Good enough that I would consider ordering other items on the menu, but not so good that I would throw around words like \"best\" or \"ever.\"  They have Kilkenny, Guinness and other standards on tap. Nothing earth-shattering. Definitely a reliable neighbourhood pub.  Obligatory Title Pun: MULL over your woes here.  Menu Readability: The interim menu was not really that charming. I'll wait for the real thing.  Need to mention: They have a small east-facing patio.  What this place teaches me about myself: Everyone needs a local."}
