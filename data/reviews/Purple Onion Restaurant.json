{"text":"A pal and I decided to get some grub after errands. She got garlic bread and I got pancakes.  The garlic bread was great but not worth the price and the pancakes were dry but decent. We also ordered chocolate cake and the server asked if we wanted ice cream. We said sure. Never did he mention it was extra, just made us assume it was a free option with the cake, like literally every other place.  The cake was dry and cold in the middle and warm on yhe outside. It fell apart when i put my fork in it and it tasted so bad i couldn't finish it. The ice cream was subpar.  Tl;dr: Mediocre food with a $2.50 scoop of ice cream."}
{"text":"Service was very poor , as well the owners sit in the back and let there kids use the place as a playground  Not a great dining atmosphere especially with the very intrusive server . Portions were small and over priced  as well our hamburger plate cost 2 bucks extra  added on silently to the bill This place has great reviews from back in the day and is clear that its under new owners that don't care to maintain the same standard of service and food quality My buddy agreed to never set foot here  and to save this kind of experience for others and write this review"}
{"text":"I like this place. It's perfect diner food plus decent steaks. My regular order is a small steak and eggs, medium rare, over medium, fries, dry brown toast with a half and half of mushrooms and onions on the side. The steak is just so much better than it has any right being. I've had it dozens of times and I think it was overdone twice. I order my eggs over medium because, elsewhere, when I order over easy, sometimes they're just a little too raw. Perfect over medium every time.  Great local diner. (my buddy's brother drives in from Markham)"}
{"text":"Second time here. First time was ok. This time Saturday at 11:30 am. No crowd, no apparent staffing issues in restaurant but:  Slow service = 10 min to menus After we ordered and waited a while food started to came in bit by bit.  then after asking for it we got coffee along with napkins and silverware  After a while we got the rest of our food order after asking for it again. After asking for it got syrup for pancake. Maybe 10 minutes later my milkshake, ordered at the same time as the food, showed up. Eventually we got water after asking for it again. Then we asked for the bill  Food was ok, but something called the mega breakfast should have more than one pancake included"}
{"text":"I know The Purple Onion since their days on Keele (just S. of St. Clair) and followed them to their Dundas West location.  As this is not too close to home, we only visit on occasion, but have noticed the growing crowds esp. for weekend brunch.  Sadly, my memories of the food at the Purple Onion do not match the reality of what I was served on Tuesday.  The daily special was Shepherd's pie, and my BF had an omelette.    The Shepherd's pie tasted stale, and was kind of soggy.  I feel as though it had been made last week, didn't get used up from last week's special, and got reheated for my serving.  Additionally, they used frozen mixed veggies (incl. green bean pieces) in the pie, when I normally expect onions with carrots / corn / peas.  Additionally, the serving was half the size of the Shepherd's pie special you can get from The Tulip (which I've also reviewed).  I'm normally not keen on coleslaw, but actually ate my coleslaw to let the tartness cover up the stale taste of the Shepherd's pie in my mouth.  This would have been a 1-star review, but my BF's omelette was nice and fluffy and he enjoyed it.  Perhaps a bad day, or a bad choice of menu item?  All I know is that I definitely don't recommend the Shepherd's pie."}
{"text":"3 words. Liver and onions. Great breakfast. Good service. Tasty food. Third best liver and onions in the city. Best liver and onions on the westside."}
{"text":"In my last trimester of pregnancy I craved burgers!!! Luckily I discovered that purple onion makes tasty homemade burgers. Nothing gourmet but just what I needed. And the prices are fantastic. It's a great no frills kinda joint."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood greasy spoon.  The eggs aren't fancy, the coffee doesn't have art on it, and there is no hipster vibe --  it does serve up a hearty breakfast with good service.  I am a frequent diner and am happy they are doing what they're doing.  Their homefries are baked or stovetop, not deep fried, their bacon is \"maple bacon\" and they have rye toast.  All of these happen to be my favourite things."}
{"text":"Great Neighbourhood Diner! What can you say? It's a typical diner menu. Well priced. Consistently good food. What I was shocked about, was how well the steaks are prepared. Perfectly timed broiled steaks. I always have the 10 oz. serloin and it's always perfect. The sides are a bit unimaginatively prepared ( it comes with some boiled broccoli, cauliflower and carrots with a garlic bun). But the meat is first class. I haven't tried the other cuts. The chops were delish as well!  The souvlaki dinners are a mountain of food and very well done as well. I also very much enjoy the club sandwitch although, I find it somewhat skimpy in the amount of meat.   They have daily specials which are well worth trying. The Sunday roast beef was a typical diner roast with gravy and mash. Tasty and satisfying.  The service is always VERY friendly and helpful. We've never had any issues. They do seem to have a bit of a high turnover though. Not sure why. Perhaps just the age of the servers.  Great place for the family! It can be very busy on a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"Was here for the 14 oz Tenderloin Steak again.  It did not disappoint.  I observed someone enjoying a hamburger and even just the look of it looked good.  I must try one and I noticed they even refurbished the the dining room furniture."}
{"text":"Not a bad breakfast.  Not impressed with the garlic bread on the hot dog bun with a barely any cheese on it. I'm not sure if I'd return."}
{"text":"The place looks way better inside than you'd expect. Large comfortable and clean booths, dark wood accents, and lots of room.   I went for a breakfast and for 8$ had breaded chicken cutlets, eggs, hashbrowns, and rye bread. Chicken cutlets for breakfast. They were a tad greasy but still heavenly. I recommend the Purple Onion highly....even if the name sounds like slang for an unidentified body part."}
{"text":"Wonderful diner in the Junction! If you're looking for a brunch, lunch, dinner spot- you've found it! The staff really care and it comes out in both the service and the food.   A standout is definitely the steak and eggs. A beautiful medium rare, great caramelization on the meat. Paired with the eggs and side of your choice, it's a pretty versatile and perfect dish for a hungry breakfast, lunch or dinner. The chicken souvlaki was similarly succulent, with all the salads, sides and tzatziki for a reasonable price. Note, there are not many options for vegetarians but there are options like a tofu sandwich, salads, etc.   It was lunchtime for us, so the coffee was delicious and plentiful. I'd definitely stop by here again whenever I'm next in The Junction. It's large enough that they can usually accommodate you, but it definitely does get hopping."}
{"text":"If your in the mood for classic Diner food, this is the perfect place. The daily specials are delicious. My personal fav is Fridays spaghetti in a meat sauce. The home made coconut cream pie is heaven on earth! I have been going to Purple Onion since their previous location on Keele Street."}
{"text":"My mum had a dream about this place before we even knew it existed, and, being from around the area we decided to check it out.  It's quite small, and the kitchen is located behind the seating instead of in front like I'm normally used to for a diner-style joint (I know it says steakhouse but they mostly seem to have a lot of diner food).  We ordered a burger and a large breakfast plate. The waiting service was satisfactory, but not overly friendly, and for a slow day it took about 25 minutes for the food to come out. Now the burger itself was super, but it was drowning in mustard when I had specifically asked for mayonnaise, and my boyfriend's pancake was burnt which was kind of weird. The rest of it was great though, I liked the option of having peameal bacon instead of regular, because peameal is -super- . :D  All in all though, it was.. okay. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there, though. Thinking of value per money I'd rate it 3.5/5 stars."}
{"text":"Never ordering from here again. My omelette came with no cheese even though I paid for it. It wasn't really even technically an omelette just eggs laid on some veggies. Did not taste good at all. The fish is way way way over priced and same to my side. So disappointed  :("}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and won't be doing that again. Thoroughly mediocre, with typically crappy potatoes and toast. The milkshake was pretty good, though.  bacon B- cheese omelette B- potatoes C toast C- chocolate milkshake B"}
{"text":"Hungover and desperate for any kind of breakfast I threw my previous experience to the wind and decided to eat here once again. I think I would have eaten just about anything to stop the queasiness in my stomach and to stop the marching band from performing a drum line in my cerebellum.  So entering with sunglasses on, and low expectations I waned simple Bacon and eggs, with a freshly squeezed OJ and an endless supply of water. Guess what? They totally delivered on all fronts.  Service was on point, snappy and attentive. When I ordered my freshly squeezed OJ and a chocolate milk for my DC they arrived right away. My water was always kept full as I tried to regulate my lingering BAC (Blood Alcohol Content).  Best of all, the food: 3 eggs over east, hash-browned potatoes and bacon (done soft... or limp as I prefer to call it). All done awesome, PLUS the portion of maple flavoured bacon was excessively large - I think I had 4-5 pieces!  I've upgraded from a disappointing 1 star to a 3 star based on all improvements but reserve further upgrades in their rating based on previous experiences.  Thanks to the Purple Onion for saving my bacon (hehe... literally) Sunday morning - it was much appreciated!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"I lived in the area for over 15 years but never been to Purple Onion. Finally, last week I decided to check it out with a friend.  We had their famous steak and eggs breakfast.  The food was yummy, inexpensive and the service was great.   I gave it 5 stars because I don't find anything wrong with this type of restaurant/local dive.  It gets 5 stars because it is exactly what you'd expect from the neighborhood diner."}
{"text":"It's been a long time - we're talking Keele & St. Clair days! - but I've found you again, my Purple Onion! How I yearned for your fare! But I found you again, and what a homecoming! Undeniably the BEST steak'n'eggs in Toronto! And with perfect homefries, sautéed mushrooms & onions on the side, nirvana has been found again! Even (& especially!) the coffee's fab! Can hardly wait to bring my loved ones this way to share the tasty joy!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Their Fish n Chips special is my absolute favourite. They have the best tartar sauce! The fish is battered perfectly, its the perfect ratio, and never too crispy or too soggy. Perfect balance! The staff is also always a dream. I also am very fond of their chicken souvlaki dinner-the tzatziki sauce is so die for.  Very reasonably priced, good selection of drinks etc. And their desserts are delicious, the coconut cream pie is homemade."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner last night, we live in the area and decided to talk a walk and decide what we wanted. Had seen this place before and decided a simple, homemade meal would be nice. A great little place - nothing fancy but the food was absolutely delicious coming from 2 people that worked in the industry for years. The burgers are the nicest burgers I have had in a very long time and a great price - what a steal!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to purple onion by my husband and his family.   And we only order one thing: the steak and eggs.     The service is quick, we usually get seated and drinks brought to our table.   The food usually comes shortly afterwards.    However, we usually go during dinner time where there's less people than the brunch crowd.   Steak and eggs - the steak came out exactly as requested and the eggs too.   The food is a bit greasy, however, my husband reminds me that we are not here to eat healthy.   Granted there are some healthy options on the menu like Greek salads,etc.  The portion sizes are good and will definitely keep you full.   It's a quaint little diner that my family enjoy good steak and eggs."}
{"text":"My wife and I just loved the burgers at Purple Onion. We normally get take out but anytime I drop in to pick up my food, the staff are always friendly and helpful (even when they are getting slammed). Anytime we get burgers from other joints, we always hold them to the Purple Onion standard... which is extremely hard to beat!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for good, cheap breakfast food - this is the spot!  LOVE this place! This is my go-to spot for breakfast food. I always get their mega breakfast and coffee. The coffee is usually a stronger brew (which I really like!) and the portions are fairly large. I'd give this place a 5 if the waitresses were more diligent and friendly. Other than that no complaints."}
{"text":"Terrible beyond belief.  Burgers were boring, they use fake mayo  onion rings seemed like they were cooked in ooold oil  coleslaw was pickled? or rotten??  WARM BEER. Gah........  Almost forgot, my friend and I made the mistake of assuming that the 6 or so people in the place were customers. nop, turned out to be a whole family that was running the place hanging out. Speaking loudly in a foreign language."}
{"text":"This place is so underrated!!! You need to come here for brunch!!!  It's definitely not that pretty inside, but if you want some delish traditional, greasy, mom&pops brunch-this is it!  Steak? good. Egg? Good.  Go here."}
{"text":"I order burgers from UberEATS here and there, thought I would give these guys a try.... they destroy the competition.   Big, classic, simple, effective.  My new go to!"}
{"text":"The four of us visited on a Saturday morning after being turned away from Littlefish (which we've now heard is closed) down the street. Perusing the menu we were glad to see that the breakfast offerings were relatively cheap, all coming in under $12! The downside, you get what you pay for. Although there was a lot of food included in the Ultimate Breakfast (2 pcs. of bacon and sausage, ham, homemade hamburger patty, eggs with homefries & toast!) none of it was all that memorable. I would have paid $10 for this meal, which costs $11.95. A decent place for breakfast but nothing to write home about (just on yelp)."}
{"text":"Great prices, excellent dinner food. Try the pies, they are homemade. I'd say they are just like my mom makes, just way better. Waiter was awesome and attentive."}
{"text":"The Purple Onion is officially a Steakhouse and Grill.  It's the only one in the Junction.  This isn't a Barberians/Bligliardis fancy time steakhouse; there are no $80 Porterhouses here.  It's more a diner that also offers fair priced yummy steak.    I go there for their breakfasts, which are served late into the afternoon.   Eggs over easy and a properly cooked 6oz steak as ordered along with toast and home fries for under $10.  Bacon, eggs, sausage, pancakes etc. If you like greasy spoon food, they have got it for a good price and it tastes good too."}
{"text":"Had breakfast with my son here, had eggs Benedict with pea-meal and my  son had grill cheese , Coffee was ok breakfast was surprisingly small and tasteless , home fries were cold and bland .I never thought someone could screw up a breakfast, worst part is I paid $20 with tip and walked out hungry."}
{"text":"I love me a greasy spoon meal every once in a while.  Today was one of those days.  Chiara and I were strolling along Dundas West in Toronto's Junction neighbourhood this morning and popped into The Purple Onion.  I'd heard about this popular greasy hotspot from another friend of mine, who claims to be a regular.  She's gone a number of times with her husband, her kids, with girlfriends.....to me, it sounded like a versatile place that everyone would like.  And so this rainy Sunday morning, Chiara and I walked in and were directed by the busy yet pleasant hostess/server to \"take a seat wherever we wanted.\" All the booths were taken, so we opted for a table near the window. As we sat at the table that looked like it belonged in an office cafeteria, we noticed that there were about a dozen more people who came in just after we did. All tables seemed to fill up within 5 minutes of us arriving. Popular spot for 9:40am on a Sunday morning.  It was just what we wanted at that moment. The busy waitress with an ever-present coffee pot, the menu listing All-Day breakfast options and other diner comfort foods, ketchup, HP Sauce and salt and pepper shakers right on the table. What a perfect place for a morning girlish gab session.  The tables were full. The coffee was hot. The French toast was tasty. Families were there with their babies in high chairs, elderly locals were reading their newspapers, young couples were nursing their hangovers from last night's partying. What a strange yet familiar mix of people who all seemed to love this greasy spoon that, once upon a time, may have been an office. (One can tell if you look carefully at the decor, structure and lay out of the place)  The place isn't fancy, but the food was tasty and cheap. If you crave bacon, eggs, pancakes, French toast, home fries, sausage and all of the other breakfast delights that you can find in a traditional greasy spoon, this is your place.  Apparently there are options for lunch and dinner that are just as tasty. I plan to back for more. I mean, I just have to try the steak now, right?"}
{"text":"Only been here for weekend brunch but the food is always really good.  Service is a bit ditzy (hey when you bring me milk packets for my tea can you not just drop a handful on the table from 5 feet like I'm a chicken?) but what can you do.  My wife was pretty annoyed at the place last time we went but that has nothing to do with the restaurant itself, we were just seated next to a screaming, anxious, ADD-riddled 6 year old who liked to climb all over her mom and my wife's jacket and scream nonsense for an hour.  Awesome.  Anyway prices are fair, food is consistently good (for brunch anyway, dunno about the rest), and I will be going back if I can convince the wife this place isn't a baby-fest."}
{"text":"Came here earlier this week - I was looking for a place to eat while in the area.   I came here with one other person. Greeted by the server as we walked in, she told us to seat ourselves and she would be with us shortly. The atmosphere is kinda nice... it's a quaint little diner that focuses mostly on breakfast. Now, I'm not particularly picky about how long it takes food to arrive because I know that there is a BIG difference between having your food cooked FAST and WELL; however, I do play close attention to how long it takes a server to take an order from the moment you sit down until they come by. At this restaurant, it took 30 minutes to come by and ask what we wanted, even though our menus were closed, stacked, and at the side of the table.  At one point while waiting for her to come by and take our order, I did hear another customer ask the waitress, \"do you have any help?\" The waitress replied with \"no, it's usually just me here taking care of everyone\". I proceeded to look around to see how many tables she was taking care of. Sure enough, there were 11 tables for just 1 waitress. They definitely need to hire more people, or something. Getting the bill was also a long wait.  The menu is cheap. I ordered a daily breakfast (it's about $6.95) with hot chocolate, while my guest ordered the Mega Breakfast (it's basically the same thing, just it comes with french toast and costs $10.95) and a tea.  The eggs and bacon were fine. The potatoes weren't very good at all. They were mostly burned, with a charcoal-like taste."}
{"text":"Walking into Purple Onion you are given a sense of good home cooking. I came in a group of 7 and luckily it wasn't busy so we were seated quickly as there was only one couple in the restaurant. If they were a little busy I wouldn't know where they would have seated us. The restaurant is small but the atmosphere is inviting. With a big glass garage door, dark brown banquettes, a nicely painted color scheme, and a small bar; it would be a great place to have a few drinks and good food on a nice summer evening.  Steak at reasonable prices. This is no fancy steakhouse but the quality of steak is pretty good. I got the 4oz New York Strip Loin with mashed potatoes, onions, and mushrooms. The steak was cooked perfectly to a medium rare and was seasoned nicely, not too salty. The mashed potatoes were creamy but for some reason tasteless and the mushrooms and onions a little too soupy. Drinks and food are at a fairly reasonable price.  Overall, I had a decent meal here. Although the sides had their flaws, the steak was good and the drinks and food are at a reasonable price. I find it a little strange that a steakhouse serves diner food as well but I guess that's part of the charm."}
{"text":"When we came to Purple Onion the line was short and the restaurant was packed which is a great sign. The staff was pleasant and friendly.  I got the steak & eggs and its was AMAZING. I came to find out that is what the are known for.  In short EAT HERE."}
{"text":"The food itself was ok. Let's just get that out of the way. It wasn't great, but it was decent diner food, which I was in the mood for. The reason I'm giving it 2 stars is the service was HORRIBLE. I was the only person in there except for the waitress' family and I'm not exaggerating when I say she didn't come over to check on me once. It took her a long time to even take my order, and once she brought my food over, I had to get up and ask for butter and water and then it literally took about  5-10 minutes before she ever came over with the water, because she was just hanging out with her family. She walked right by my table sweeping and cleaning up, saw when I was done, and it was another 10 minutes before that before she ever came and picked my plate up. She didn't bring the check, I had to go up and ask for it. Pretty bad service experience all around."}
{"text":"If our experience hadn't ended on a high note, this place deserved one-star. Around the restaurant various reviews/awards are posted and I can understand why but it's purely based on specific menu items (like their coconut cream pie).  Primarily my pet peeve with this place was it smelled like a washroom that hadn't been cleaned in a while. This is not something you want to smell when you're eating! The meal that I had was average, if not disappointing. Their potatoes were spicy, the coffee was too strong but their scrambled eggs were perfect.  At the end of the meal, I decided to try the award, winning coconut cream pie which was delicious! Made in house, the large, fluffy slice made me almost forget about the rest of the meal.  All in all, if you like coconut cream pie, this is a place to try!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were searching for a place to brunch one Sunday morning. We decided on the Purple Onion almost solely based on Kent's 4-star review. I am now left wondering what life choices Kent has made to want to give this place 4-stars.  Let's start with the service. Wait, what service? There wasn't any. Once we had placed our orders the waitress disappeared. After much too long of a wait we were offered coffee and tea refills and when it came time for the bill we just had to get up and ask for it at the counter. Maybe we should have just walked out without paying, I doubt they would have even noticed. My friend and I also noticed this same situation was happening at the table next to us and overheard them complaining about it too.  For my meal I chose the Ultimate Breakfast. It consists of 2 pieces of bacon and sausage, ham, hamburger patty, eggs with homefries and toast. Sounds pretty good right? Well if you look at the picture I uploaded what I actually got was the Saddest Breakfast. The Saddest Breakfast consists of 2 pieces of cold bacon, 2 dried out sausages, a rubbery slice of ham, an ok hamburger patty, eggs, a soggy mess of homefries[1], and burnt rye toast that they charge extra for and don't tell you. Yes, they give you the option of rye toast but don't tell you upfront that there is an additional charge.   [1] I'm a purist when if comes to homefries, french fries, etc. and never put ketchup on them. I put ketchup these ones."}
{"text":"Breakfast review:  Purple Onion is simply a greasy spoon breakfast. The food (eggs, bacon, French toast, sausage, home fries, etc.) are all standard fare like you would find at any breakfast place, which is not good or bad, it just is what it is.  A not so careful look around will reveal that there are areas where the duster and cleaning cloths did not reach. So let's say below average in general cleanliness in the dining area.  On the other hand, the service, depending on who your server is, can be quite good. I never waited long to order, receive food, or get a top off on my coffee.  Prices here are average.  If you simply want a standard breakfast, Purple Onion is a definite option."}
{"text":"On a beautiful early November morning, I dropped the Missus off at work and decided to hit up The Junction, a neighbourhood I had only discovered this summer, but have yet to explore. I was hungry for some diner breakfast and kept my eyes peeled for a good spot and fortunately the traffic stopped me directly in front of the Purple Onion, \"Famous for our steaks and breakfast\" the sign out front says. So I pulled over, parked out front and went in. The place immediately had a comfortable vibe, with a number of booths, nice dark brown colours, tiny little bar (3-4 stools) and plenty of floor seating. The crowd (of 2 tables) was an older couple at a booth reading their papers, and another couple playing Scrabble but the window. Perfect already. The menu was your classic diner menu, breakfast on one page, entrees on the other. I grabbed a traditional brekkie of scrambled eggs, home fries, rye toast and sausage. It came out quickly and hot. Everything tasted great (except the coffee) and for less than $9 I was happy.  Great service too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  I am surprised that how low the prices for steak are at this joint.  The service was great, and the food was great.  The only inconvenience for me was the location.  Other then that, I am differently going back."}
{"text":"This is your basic greasy spoon with some surprisingly reliable steak and eggs and old fashioned breakfast specials. The eggs and toast are cheap, top notch and delivered quickly. However, the omelettes could use some more balance (often basically it's an egg stir fry with cheese) and the breakfast sausage could be better quality. The pork souvlaki is pretty great and generous helpings of everything for the price. The service is friendly even when they're jammed on a Saturday morning rush. They're open fairly late in a quiet neighbourhood with few non-bar weekday options which gets them the fourth star. It's not fancy but it's faithful."}
{"text":"Less than mediocre brunch....both the food and environment.  The coffee was terrible too.  Service was nice though."}
{"text":"Went here once before, sat down for 15 mins before I got up and left because no one wanted to serve me even though there were only two couples there. Decided to try it again, order the regular poutine ($9) and it was pourly made. Fries were not done, no cheese but the gravy was good. Definitely not worth 9$...there are so many other places to go in the junction."}
{"text":"Got challenged being out from my comfort zone being an Eastender. Thanks too the Yelp Elite team who organised a good event here. If not, I'd never know such a cool place existed in the West end.  This local, casual diner gives a family dine-in place feel. Besides the breakfast style classics on their menu Anna, is what makes the place so awesome. She's friendly, warm and attentive being our waitress for the night.   I ordered the steak ( medium rare) and eggs ( over & easy). Love how they don't season and the food here taste almost home cook.   Being a hot sauce lover, I would definitely recommend the awesome housemade hot sauce. With the fries, it was an awesome combination."}
{"text":"I am not a big breakfast lover... generally I need to be wowed (and sometimes dragged out of bed) to really enjoy breakfast. That being said the Purple Onion was pretty good but still has some room for improvement  I ordered the steak and eggs; my steak was cooked perfectly and tasted great. I asked for a boiled egg (cuz I prefer eating egg whites) and the waitress practically puzzled as if I had asked her for my egg to be dipped in sewage! Her look indicated she had no clue what a boiled egg was and/or they didn't make them. I ordered a well done fried egg instead and ate around the yoke.   The home fries here are pretty lackluster and even though I will usually pick at even the worse variety I lost my appetite for these ones quite quickly.  Overall my dining experience was ok and the price was very reasonable at $9.99."}
{"text":"Walked in and was already cautious as the floor was filthy. The food was disgusting and when we tried to express ourselves the owner was rude and loud. Made a huge scene and threatened to call the police. Don't eat here. The food was cold, dry and clearly old and reheated. They tried to pass my \"chopped beef\" off as the same hamburger patty my husband ordered (for way cheaper by the way). All of it was SO old and the worst part was it took FOREVER to come out.  Just plain nasty."}
