{"text":"I loved everything about this steak house. The drinks were off the chain and the food made my toes curl. Foodies, this is a great steak house."}
{"text":"This was our first time here it was their second weekend open for business.  We brought our friends before the Journey concert.  Spent $400. The seafood tower was one of the worst we've ever had in town.  We ordered the biggest seafood tower for four but they gave us a serving for two.  The crab legs were so skinny there was no meat to pull out,  two very small half lobster tails served in a large metal bowl.  Our server was very nice but he had to say they were out or didn't have several items we asked for.  $400 is not worth this steakhouse.  The Decor inside was very nice though so it's unfortunate that the food wasnt up to standards.  We eat at steak houses often and I would not go back."}
{"text":"Food is delicious! I got the filet mignon with a side of shrimp scampi and lobster mac n cheese. It is a bit noisy, but overall I liked the atmosphere and decor. Service from our waiter was horrible. He seemed annoyed and rushed. I don't remember his name, but I remember his face . Definitely will come back, but request a different waiter."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the atmosphere and the staff. MB Steak was very intimate and sexy inside. Will be visiting again."}
{"text":"John O'Donnell, better known to locals as \"JOD\" is the best bartender in ALL THE LAND. It's so refreshing to go to an upscale restaurant and have such a personable bartender with a sense of humor while you dine on the city's best steaks and sides. Pro Tip  GET THE MIYATAKI MUSHROOMS and lobster Mac & cheese! 

If it's your birthday  3 words: BIRTHDAY CAKE SHAKE."}
{"text":"The atmosphere could be a bit better, but THE FOOD is amazing. Wasn't enthralled with their signature cocktails; skip them and stick to wine. Steaks were cooked and seasoned to perfection. Sides are very rich. Portions were larger than expected. If in doubt, under order. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My husband & I stopped in at social hour and sat at the bar for an early dinner. We always sit at the bar in places because generally service is always faster and more attentive. Luckily we saw the menu online because the bartender never gave us one. When my husband ordered a Miller Lite she said it was not on HH. Had to bust out my phone with the online menu to show her it was. She said no one comes in for HH. Really? Other than that, service was ok the rest of the time. Not fantastic.....just ok

Both the bar and restaurant are beautiful. A very warm & inviting atmosphere We ordered a crab cake & a burger. Excellent! They also brought out a little tasting of a tuna poke that was delicious. Ate that so fast forgot to take a picture. We will go back but next time we'll get a table for a better dining experience."}
{"text":"Some could claim this is an unfair post since I was eating at the bar, but some basics were simply missed. If in the main seating area, would give it two stars

1) wasn't provided a place setting until after food arrived and I requested
2) had no knife, and when asked he literally took the knife from the guy next to me and gave it to me, wtf?
3) would pour the wine from my bottle like I was drinking a boxed wine
4) as for food decent enough for the price, but creme brulee was cold (not chilled) throughout including the top

I miss the old steak restaurant at the Hard Rock, better restaurants in the casino to choose from - Nobu, Pink Taco, or Fu"}
{"text":"We like to try a different steakhouse every Thanksgiving weekend when we're in town and since we were staying at the Hard Rock, going to MB Steak was a no-brainer.  The service was impressive from the minute you check in at the front until the time you leave.  Our server was attentive, but not intrusive.  Our appetizers consisted of the onion soup (oh the yummy melted cheese!), a beautifully presented salad, and oysters on the half shell -- all were delicious.  Our filets were cooked to perfection and our sides, the maitake mushrooms and the potato gratin, were great!  They have an impressive wine and spirits list to choose from as well.  Unfortunately we were too stuffed to try the desserts, but hopefully next time!  The only thing that someone in our party complained of was the volume level of the music, so I deduct a star for that -- other than that, a great dining experience was had by all!"}
{"text":"Curt really helped us out! He gave us a great wine recommendation and all of our food came out super fast and tasted amazing. This is an amazing steakhouse! Cool atmosphere too."}
{"text":"An unassuming stellar steakhouse inside the Hard Rock hotel. Wood covered walls, some neo soul sounds and a even handed menu that walks a fine line between steakhouse and seafood with just enough options in between for those that dont eat either. I was surprised to see the Chef making table visits including ours and watching the teamwork among the staff. 

Everything we tried was fantastic and the service was excellent.  The salmon with the fennel crust was juicy, the lamb chops werent overly gamey and they came with this amazing cous cous type of grain. I was surprised to see a steakhouse carry a burger on their menu for dinner and one person in my party ordered it. OMG! The flavors were so well balanced somehow the vinegar soaked tomatoes complimented the hearty burger that was about an inch thick and the smokey slab of bacon.  For $25 i thought it would be a small dainty burger but it was a feast. 

We finished off the meal with their 7 layer carrot cake that was tasty from top to bottom. One thing that sets this place apart is the service: manager visits table, chef says hi, after the server drops off the food they ask \"anything else?\", the server walks you through the menu and doesnt assume youve been there before and lastly they explain whats on the plate. 

id happily recommend them to friends and visitors to Vegas."}
{"text":"Lovely lady and I decided to meet prior to YEE Magic Mike and partake in dinner.
VERY glad we did! 

We were greeted by beautiful ladies who proceeded to try and set us in the gorgeous dining room...maybe next time! We chose to sit in the bar area and I am glad we did.

The amazing server we had really made the experience a wonderful one. Too bad I am horrrrrible with names and can't remember hers :( 

LL was forced by me to order the Magic Mike specialty cocktail and I ordered a Born and Bred (Channing Tatums vodka) on the rocks with tonic and lime. Her drink was poured skillfully and of course we have a video for proof. It was fun and fruity. The cotton candy was a super fun touch. The Born and Bred was the best potato vodka I have had! I usually request Chopin and now I must find this brand for the home bar.

Cheese bread was brought for LL and we went ahead and ordered two entrees to get the ball rolling. 

A beautiful king crab cake was brought to LL and she said it was delicious!!!! But if i could scream to the top of the mountains...it would be for my entree...

The Vegan Surprise!!!! The vegan surprise turned out to be a vegan risotto with a zillion dollars worth of amazing roasted Matake mushrooms. Pea puree, asparagus and perfectly cooked rice was also presented. 
I had messaged ahead, thank you god for social media, to see if had even been possible and wow this surprise entree did not disappoint.

Brothers Morton you have two new customers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! One being a vegan!!!! Who would have thought!!!!!

Congrats on a place of true care and love!!!!"}
{"text":"Dined at the new MB Steak last night and it was fantastic. I sat at the bar upstairs, which is absolutely stunning, and shared mashed potatoes, a Parmesan crusted filet, the chopped salad, rock shrimp and salmon. Our bartenders were super friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Great service and great meal. The grits were amazing. The steak was perfectly cooked. Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Amazing food great service and wonderful ambiance, am so impressed with this place!! Oysters were very fresh, Stone crab legs amazing, and the steak melting in my mouth! Dennis is an excellent server, be sure to request him. Not to mention the wine list, spectacular. This is my second time here and I have not been disappointed, highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Decided to treat myself to a Christmas dinner of wine... with some steak... and had been wanting to try MB for a while since the Hard Rock is easy to get to from my house (not to mention hassle free parking). 

The reviews on yelp so far are accurate.  It was fabulous.  

I was greeted by a beautiful hostess who knew right away my name and request to sit at the bar (solo dining). Upon arrival to the bar,  Michelle greeted me and like a sixth sense offered me the wine list.  The list was great,  with many offerings from old world to new.  I landed on a beautiful Napa Cab from Long Meadow Ranch, as I knew the Mount Veeder grapes they use would have a perfect tanic accompaniment to a steak.  

They brought out the bread (which was AMAZE) and i ordered a Caesar salad and a bone in filet.  Michelle suggested I get the parmesan crust on my steak and she was sooooo right on.  My salad was simple and perfect.  The steak was to die for.  I love a good bone in filet,  but that crust tho! I finished my meal with an outstanding Sautern paired with the layered carrot cake.  That carrot cake was bomb! I'd go back just for the dessert! 

Al in all,  the service was fantastic,  the food was on point and my Christmas dining experience was top notch."}
{"text":"This place is trying to be a high end steakhouse.  Very unprofessional from the waiter to Lurch the wine steward.  To many great and professional steakhouses in Vegas to waste your time with this one.  My bone in filet was not good."}
{"text":"Very nice dining experience at MB last night.   The steaks were prepared perfectly, the sides were great and the sommelier selected a beautiful wine to compliment the meal.  Service was 5 star as well.  The owner even came to our table to thank us.    Recommend very highly."}
{"text":"My favorite dining experience I've had in the city hands down. The atmosphere is wonderful, the service was fantastic, and the food was so delicious I felt guilty for not finishing every last bite."}
{"text":"So traveling the country and eating at many steakhouses I was really looking forward to dining here. I wish I could say I was impressed but overall it was very loud to a point where you couldn't hear table conversation, fairly pricey and the steaks did not impress (not even close to Med Rare). Service was great and attentive. There are many choices in Vegas, this would not be at the top of my list .  Maybe it was an off night, but not memorable."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Loved everything we ordered. The steak was soooo good but the bread and salad were super yummy too. Kurt took really good care of us. 

Most of the fancy places do too much with their steak, this place keeps simple but you can get different toppings for it. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We eat out all the time. This is one of our top five meals. Kurt was an excellent server. One of the best we have had. Great personality. Please treat yourself and come here."}
{"text":"The filet mignon tartare was a delicious start. For my dinner I had the mashed potatoes, mushrooms with goat cheese and the tomahawk steak which was perfectly cooked. For dessert I had the raspberry lemon merengue. During my entire time there John at the bar was great. My only problem is that I don't live close enough to go often."}
{"text":"We had an amazing dinner at MB Steak.  The steak house was great, but our waiter Kurt made it a night to remember!  He took his time with us, made great recommendations, and made sure every part of our dinner was perfect.  I highly recommend the NY Steak."}
{"text":"I can't even remember the name of my salad, garden/chopped/house...All I remember is that is was not the Cesar. This salad was delicious very simple but definitely tasty! I hosted a party there. The service was great everyone was attentive. I got a filet and it smelled amazing. It was cooked to temperature I requested, but the seasoning was a tad salty. A couple of my guests their steaks or either undercooked or overcooked. The asparagus was a little Woody and a little too well done. I would definitely go back because it was a party and it's hard to get all the orders done at the same time. The atmosphere in the restaurant was very nice and the drinks were tasty. Our dessert was a mousse that was delicious."}
{"text":"This place was amazing from the food to the service. We're a very picky when it comes to restaraunts and this place was definitely up to par. Our server gave us great recommendations, the manager Rafael was extremely attentive and made sure everything was good and the bartender John made the best drinks. We cannot wait to go back and enjoy this amazing restaraunt. I would highly highly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"We visited MB Steak with a party of 2 (with a reservation) on Friday, December 22 at 6pm.  

We normally don't do dining experiences on the more \"expensive\" side; however, sometimes we like to treat ourselves.  This experience was A++.

We decided to arrive at about 5:30PM to take advantage of \"social hour\" in the bar area, where many of the drinks were just $9.00.  We were seated at our table just a few minutes before our reservation and we had an excellent time.

MB Steak has a casual, yet elegant decor.  We dressed up; however, I feel you could get away dining at this restaurant a little bit more on the casual side; however, definitely felt in place dressing up.  I loved the colors and style of the restaurant.

We truly felt like valued guests the entire time.  Sadly, I forgot the name of our server.  We had two servers, one who was training another.  The trainee was the primary server and did a great job.  We were constantly being checked on; however, left alone at the appropriate times.  

The food gets four thumbs up!  Wow!  Everything we had was super delicious and cooked the way we wanted it.  We ended up sharing the Diver Sea Scallops with the 18oz Ribeye with Garlic Parm Crust and Shrimp Scampi.  We also shared a side of the Miatake Mushrooms.  Everything just melted in our mouth and we truly thought each dish had its own unique test, unique to that restaurant.  

We were too full for dessert; however, they brought us out a Triple Chocolate Truffle Cake compliments due to us celebrating our anniversary.  Ok, can I say something here??   Don't skip dessert because you are too full.  Take it home.  THIS CAKE WAS AMAZING!

Our entire experience was great, and I really appreciated this evening.  I would return again here if given the opportunity."}
{"text":"Likely my favorite place to eat in Vegas currently.  I can eat there enough.  Even held company holiday party there.  Staff are absolutely amazing.  I can't say enough about the food.  I've tried most all the menu and oh man when we go it's a hard pick.  Posting many picks.  These are all from November and December 2017.  Grits are a must order!  Filet, ribeye, any meat awesome!!  Sides also can't pick a wrong one."}
{"text":"Worst service.  We made a reservation and were seated at a lounge table at the bar.  When we asked why we weren't seated in the restaurant they said they gave our table away for being 10 minutes late.  Although the restaurant was over half empty, the manager and hostess said it was our fault.  The whole experience was insulting.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"From the crab cakes to the parmesan crusted veal I was blown away by how delicious everything was! The living skylight over the upstairs bar is the perfect place to enjoy one of their unique cocktails. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We were very surprised by the atmosphere and the noise level.  Since we enjoy a good steak dinner once a week and I am on a quest to try every steakhouse in Las Vegas, MB is way out in left field.  Having a speaker every 3 feet blaring music is not necessary, I think they missed the boat and concept of a good steakhouse.  35 Steakhouse which used to be at the Hard Rock Hotel was much better and the service was 10 times better.  The hipster concept and poor service is disappointing especially when you are charging top dollar for steaks.   After reading the menu and the story behind the Brothers Morton I commend them for the venture, but give them a thumbs down for ruining the steak dinner concept."}
{"text":"Amazing... had the bone in NY and it was perfection.  Casual atmosphere, great bar tenders and their little bread thing you get before the meal is awesome"}
{"text":"Thanks for a wonderful experience!  Aaron M. was super nice and Johnny our bartender was one of the funniest and friendliest we've had.  The Octopus appetizer, Tartare, Lobster bisque and Carrot Cake...simply grand!  We will most definitely recommend this to anyone out there.  Please check it out!"}
{"text":"I was surprised given all the wonderful restaurants we ate at this week at CES that this restaurant had the best flavor profiles and balance.  We had their Tuna Poke and it was the best I ever had and well presented with a balance of flavors that was stunning.  The bread is crazy good - be careful as it is a corn and flour based decedent slight cheese bread. The Fois Gras was fattened perfectly and cooked where it looked golden and slightly brown but tender to eat like a soft Gelatin Mold and bursting with flavor - just right amount of Goose Liver flavor and accompanying sweetness of strawberry marinated and cooked on the side.  Very good."}
{"text":"MB Steak was our favorite meal during our visit to Vegas. We saw the menu online prior to our reservation. Upon arrival we were greeted with smiles. 

Our Host Gemma was professional and friendly.She suggested we order the roasted cauliflower (yum). Let me just say, her meal suggestions were on point. I ordered Shrimp Risotto, Alaskan Halibut, and the layered Carrot Cake was delicious! Our meal was flavorful and seasoned to perfection. 

We enjoyed the entire meal experience. 

Thanks Gemma, 5 star !!    Your friends from Napa.."}
{"text":"Spending the weekend in Vegas. Wanted a steak dinner and MB Steak delivered. Our server, Kirk, was always right there making sure our coffee cup was filled and answering our questions. Highly recommend MB Steak and Kirk!"}
{"text":"The experience at MB started way better than it finished, unfortunately. The bread was delicious, we ordered the appetizer of the day, the shrimp & king crab pasta dish which was phenomenal, perfect for two people to share, highly recommend. 

We ordered the Australian Wagyu steak and paired it with the king crab oscar with lobster mac n cheese and potato gratin to share. 

First, was super disappointed that the crab oscar style is on top of the steak, we thought it would be a side style, ruins the favor of a nice steak to do that. The Wagyu, was hands down the WORST we've ever had. It was tough to cut and chew. It didn't have that normal Wagyu marbled flavor / texture. Took one bite and was over it. Lobster mac n cheese, also a disappointment. The pasta was very undercooked and not worth eating. The potato gratin was good and had a nice crispy topping to it. 

The server ended up getting super busy so service after the food came was almost non existent. Seemed more of a staffing issue there. 

Overall, having eaten at several of the other nice steak houses in Vegas, I wouldn't recommend this place. The seafood was the best part."}
{"text":"A great place for dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe Hotel. The place has an amazing atmosphere and it is nicely decorated.

The attention from the hostess and the waiter is top notch. 

Why i have not given them 5 stars is because there was a detailed they missed, another party came in later than us and they got served before us. We had ordered quite in advance. Maybe he was a regular, but for a 1st experience you need to look into those details.

Food: They had some items that where not on the menu and we decided to try the fried calamari as a starter.

Our first plate was a regular Caesar salad, which was good. Nothing outstanding to report on it.

For our main course we had the Bone Dry NY steack which was superbly done. We had it well done and it came well presented and not dry. This order medium rare would be great.

Dessert was the highlight with the Lemon pie. You have to try it!"}
{"text":"The food and service are outstanding. My husband had the 8 oz Filet Mignon and the Au Gratin potatoes, and I had a Stone Crab claw. The filet was perfectly cooked and a very excellent cut of meat. The peppercorn sauce he had with it was to die for. The crab was delicious, moist and sweet. One note - I had seen a few reviews that mentioned the steaks were a little salty, which my husband confirmed. Just ask your server to have them cut down on the salt or eliminate it completely.

The Manager, server, and staff were friendly, made us feel like family, and extremely attentive. The menu is really extensive with something for everyone.

We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Service was good,food was mediocre at best! $24.00 for salty lobster mac and cheese.Excuse for everything was just opened 6 days ago. Could not split the check 8 ways, claiming systems were down. Came here for a friends bday was not impressed won't be back. BWW or Chilli's  will get you a better meal. 1 star for service and 1 star for decor."}
{"text":"We had a party of eight, food was the \"best steaks\" we have had, we had all types from filet to ribeye, to New York.  Spent over  $1,000.  We go to the best steak houses in Vegas every year for over 20 years.  However, the Somalia was giving us attitude all night cause we brought our family wine.  We decided to come back two nights later had reservation the same Somalia was there with the attitude and said he was going to charge us twice as much.  Which didn't go over  very well.  We left and went to Del Fresco and got treated like kings."}
{"text":"It's too bad when a steakhouse hires an ol' time macho man-ish dude to work the bar who cannot relate to customers unless they happen to step out of a 1980s television set complete with a Larry Hagman cowboy hat and the same BS personae that comes with it.  However, Larry Hagman was a great guy.  The bartender should be working at Sizzler and not a high-end restaurant with an incredible menu and delicious food.  Unfortunately, he overshadowed the exemplary food and experience.  Shame on us for not simply requesting a different bartender (like the one serving other guests at the other end of the bar.  She was great).  We kept thinking that perhaps he'd metamorphosize into an actual human being.  Didnt happen.  As guests in the hotel for several nights, literally everything else we experienced was awesome at the Hard Rock.  This guy is damaging and toxic.  Do yourselves a favor and request ANYONE else but him to take care of you should you decide to dine in their lovely bar MB Steakhouse bar."}
{"text":"Delicious.....we had filet mignon and lamb chops.....my lamb chops with barley and spinach side was cooked perfect (rare for me, super pink but tender) loved the barley.  The other steaks at the table were also perfectly cooked as requested and delicious.  Try the parmesan garlic crust on your steak.

They're house bread was interesting - mix of focacia and something else - loved it.

Kurt the server steered us well from beginning to end, started us off with scallop appetizer for us and finishing us with the triple layer chocolate cake. 

A meal to remember - perfect  :)"}
{"text":"Love, love, love....I'm in love with MB Steak.  We popped in before Magic Mike for heavy appetizers and drinks.  The bar area was perfect for our large group.  Nothing was a problem and they were completely sweet about us having no reservation.  We ordered filet, fish, calamari, au gratin potatoes, mushrooms and other vegetables (that I didn't eat). Everything was DELICIOUS.  EVERYTHING.  My personal favorite was the perfectly cooked filet and potatoes.  Our drink orders kept coming and all 15 of us left happy, slightly buzzed and ready to laugh and giggle at the show.  Thank you MB for a fun start to our night!!"}
{"text":"First off - Kurt is the best waiter on the strip. He navigated me on choosing the best dishes, wines and sides - the dinner was excellent thanks to his guidance and candor. Onto the food - 

Excellent! This is likely the best steak I've had in VEGAS. The meat quality is superb, as is the preparation. There's an excellent selection of sides, along with steak sauces and prep options. 

I will be back repeatedly!"}
{"text":"Our favorite steakhouse! We've been here since the opening and it never fails to disappoint. Everything tastes amazing. You will not be disappointed ever! Tonight, we brought friends who are visiting to try it out. They were amazed. The staff was wonderful as usual. Kurt was our head server and he was funny, attentive and overall wonderful. We had the tomahawk and NY Strip steaks with the mashed potatoes and Brussel sprouts for sides. For dessert we had the best carrot cake ever! Can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic New Year Dinner! Kurt our server went above and beyond for our rowdy party of 12! Food was incredible!!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is incredibly underrated. Everything we had was amazing! The bread... omg yum. My girlfriend and I split the NY strip. The table also shared roasted cauliflower, bacon Brussel sprouts, lobster Mac and cheese, and scalloped potatoes. Let's face it. Vegas is expensive. But if you want to get excellent food for what you are paying... this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Dined at MB Steak with several business colleagues. The music volume in the restaurant was so loud it was a challenge having a conversation and at 5pm (when they open) we were literally the only seated table. I recognize it's in the Hard Rock, but blasting music in a steakhouse wasn't conducive to conversation. 

The steaks were seasoned properly and I enjoyed the bone-in NY that was dry aged. My guests enjoyed their steaks as well. 

The peppercorn sauce was tasty. 

Potato gratin, creamed corn and asparagus were very good. 

They charge a corkage fee, I think it was $35. 

Overall it was good food, attentive service but due to the noise volume, probably won't return with business clients."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to MB steak and I was definitely impressed. The dining area is intimate so the staff is very attentive to the customers needs. The decor is absolutely beautiful as well. I had the 6oz by strip traditional waygu steak and my wife had the 6oz filet. Both were delicious. Mine came sliced in medallions on top of some very tasty vegetables. I really like the \"crust\" or seasoning that was on the steak. It really added a nice flavor. We also shared the poblano cream corn. It had good size chunks of crab meat and it was not very spicy. The staff was also excellent, and I mean the entire staff. From the hostess to the bus person. All were customer focused. I will eat here again and recommend to friends/family."}
{"text":"I dined at MB Steak shortly after it opened, and it was fantastic! The crab cake was phenomenal and I also loved the fennel crusted salmon. I was also surprised how much I LOVED the bread - seriously delicious! Service was friendly and attentive. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great service and superb food. Our server Bernie was outstanding.
The steaks are top notch. Great drinks and atmosphere.
Love this place."}
{"text":"Best steak of my life..the parm garlic crust sealed the deal. The creamed spinach with poached egg was also amazing, only downfall was the bar service. We educated our waiter on botanical gin, and won't ever forget the melt in your mouth steak experience."}
{"text":"The food and service was great. Matt was the best server/waiter you could ask for and is from Brooklyn. He manager on duty however was a piece of work. Visited every table that had customers wearing suits but if you weren't I. A suit he didn't have time for you. 
If this is the way management thinks then they don't need anymore of my money. It spends just as good as he rich mans!"}
{"text":"I adore this place. The service is wonderful. I love the atmosphere, dark & 1920s style. You'll find Johnny O'Donnell behind the bar being awesome per usual. Love him. I'm a fan of most of the menu. They're not the best steakhouse in town, but they're very good. Good steaks and delicious sides. Finish with the caramel banana cheesecake!"}
{"text":"This is a very nice restaurant with a professional and knowledgeable staff.  Very dapper looking host seated us immediately and invited us to visit the lounge upstairs after dinner. Very thoughtful.  Dinning room looked super cool, lighting and music spoke more of a hip scene than an elegant one. The food was great and presented well.  Oysters very good.  Iceberg salad really interesting presentation was delicious.  The steaks were perfectly cooked and definitely a Morton steak, tastily charred on the outside and miraculously rare on the inside. Wine was reasonably priced and served by a friendly sommelier. Only strike, and I can't really hold against the restaurant, was the clientele.  It is the Hard Rock so the steady stream of T-shirt and short panted guys with beer bottles in their hands paraded through the dining room.  It looked as though they were treated just as hospitably, so kudos to MB Steak."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect. Had lobster bisque soup, salmon and the cream corn with crab was to die for. Kurt was our waiter. Offered all the right stuff. Went above and beyond what a server needs to do. I'm usually a tough one to please! Outstanding!"}
{"text":"I'm in Vegas for work, staying at the HRH. My co-workers and I decided to have dinner here one night after work after hearing good things. 

The service was very good, our server was attentive, helpful and friendly. The ambiance of the restaurant was very nice, with the exception of the noise level....it was extremely loud even though it wasn't very crowded. 

Our food arrived in a timely fashion, however, the meal was very disappointing...for all 3 of us. Everything was extremely over salted. We ordered a creme brûlée to share, which was very good, but the meal was not. This is a very pricey restaurant and to have paid a small fortune to eat and then be extremely disappointed, was salt in the wound. Pun intended."}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate at MB Steak last week. It was her first time in Las Vegas, and I wanted to show her the best that Las Vegas had to offer. MB Steak did not disappoint!!

From the moment we arrived, the Manager and Hostess treated us like royalty. We were shown to our table, but we asked if we could move to another one, just out of personal preference. We were told \"absolutely\" and were promptly moved to the table of our choice.

The ambience was fantastic. The perfect steakhouse. It was modern, quiet, and very relaxing - which is unbelievable, since it's right in the Hard Rock Casino! The lighting and décor was perfect.

The drink and appetizer menu was awesome. My daughter had some sort of drink that was a production - it involved cotton candy in the drink! I had wine, and the selection was exactly what I was looking for - a range from modest to out of sight. The Somm was non-judgmental as I told him that I was going to go cheap and get the least expensive bottle of Shiraz. He told me it was a good choice, and it was!

The shrimp cocktail was the best I have ever had, and I am from Florida and a shrimp snob. The salad was one of the very best ever too.

I had the filet for dinner with asparagus. I don't remember what my daughter had, but it was all great.

The most perfect part of the night was the service. In addition to the Manager, Hostess, and Somm going out of their way to make us feel welcome, we had what must be one of the greatest servers of all time - Fernando. He was perfect from the moment we got there. He checked on us and attended every need or desire, without intruding. He was friendly and welcoming and made us feel like regulars - which we hope to be. 

If you get a chance to go to MB Steak, don't delay - you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came for an anniversary dinner. The food was amazing! Filled was tender with high quality flavor, creamed corn with king crab was delicious, and the habanero and jalapeño margarita was worth reordering for a second round. We will definitely be back when we stay at HRH again."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to MB Steakhouse for our 2nd anniversary. We weren't able to really celebrate our 1st anniversary due to some health issues I had so this one was very important to us. We had such an amazing time at MB Steakhouse. The food was impeccable but that was just the cherry on top. The service we received from Kurt and Rafael is what made our experience worth while! Thank you so much to MB Steak and those two gentlemen for creating such an amazing experience for my husband and I!!"}
{"text":"We came here for my birthday as we were already staying at the Hard Rock. The restaurant itself is not really large and very dark inside. The lighting/ceiling feature was really unique - almost looked like a very large fan with lots of different spokes and then black spiky blown glass on the end of each of those spokes. 
Our appetites weren't real big which worked well as the restaurant offers smaller portions. I opted for the scallops and my husband ordered the salmon, we were both very happy with the meal. We shared a Caesar prior to the entree and it was a bit odd for me, the dressing tasted like vinegar. 
Service was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Best Steaks in Las Vegas... We couldn't get enough.. The Service was Outstanding..... Kurt made our evening perfect he is the best waiter in Vegas.. Best service we have ever had in Vegas.   The Lobster was great.. Drinks are unique try the Magic Mike.  We were very impressed. Thank you for making my Birthday  Very Special..

{"text":"I came in here and had amazing service from a talented staff that included Michelle who is a very friendly, professional bartender. I had a steak at the bar, it was perfectly aged and their mb steak sauce was amazing. I was actually really excited that I found a great new spot.

That was Monday.

I decided to come back today (Wednesday) and there is a large older man behind the bar, I ordered a steak, I think he actually ignored my steak sauce request, and then he put out a fork touching the business end of the fork after playing with the register and touching who knows what else. When I mentioned to him that I would like to cancel the order and that I was grossed out he really didn't care and acted surprised asking me a couple times if I really wanted to cancel the order (btw he put the fork back, maybe you get to taste his hands). This is unsanitary, unprofessional and I could feel newly appropriated vomit wanting to come up my throat. If you, unlike me, would like to taste an old mans dirty hands then mb steak is the spot for you. When you order a steak they give you sea salt, seasoning, some mb steak sauce on the side, but the mystery is what this bartender has touched that will be going into your mouth (I assume a guy who touches the business end of the fork while putting it out probably doesn't care much about washing his hands when going to the bathroom). Enjoy your special mb steak house seasoning! Yummy! (Btw another post on here has a photo of him with two women that says his name is John)"}
{"text":"Ate here last night, and had a very good experience. I'm not surprised considering this steak house is part of the Morton's Steakhouse family. Definitely more upscale than Morgan's, with prices not that much higher. Cocktails were perfect. Steaks were perfectly seasoned and juicy, so no need for anything on top. The rest of the food was good. Lobster Mac had nice sized lobster chunks in it, the mashed potatoes were smooth and tasty. The cheddar bread they bring out is just awesome, especially if get some crusty bits. The service was fantastic, staff welcoming, friendly and around just enough. I'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious meal with friend, great services, thank your to our server Kurt and the bartender Johnnie they were both a delight.  Hats off to the genteman who poured our bubbly he was a hoot too!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and even better service by Kurt!! We had the crab cakes, heirloom tomato salad, salmon, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and  steak burger!! We will definitely be back!!! Thank you for the incredible service!!"}
{"text":"Kurt was amazing and made dinner a pleasure. The food amazing and will definitely come back on my next visit. Thanks you guys!"}
{"text":"Kurt was amazing!!! Very knowledgeable on menu items and provided excellent recommendations. I'm a Las Vegas local who had family in town, and I will definitely be back! Great food and the service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Was not impressed..they said it was affiliated with Morton's steak house so that was the reason we checked out this place. Service was not comparable at all, extremely disappointed and to think we celebrated a birthday here. Spent close to $300 for dinner and was not worth it..go to Morton's or Mastros instead.

Tomahawk 4/5
Sides dishes were 4/5
Birthday shake was -5/5 it was whipped cream wtf"}
{"text":"Four of us girls dined at MB Steak before going to the Magic Mike show at the Hard Rock Hotel. We decided to share a large steak and a bunch of sides: the Porterhouse steak, roasted cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, Yukon mashed potatoes, and a Caesar salad. Everything was flavorful and seasoned to perfection.

Our waiter was funny, friendly, and accommodating. His assistants also kept our table cleared of empty dishes and filled our water glasses promptly.

If I find myself at the Hard Rock Hotel again, I would certainly go back to MB Steak."}
{"text":"Went here last night after Raiding the Rock Vault. Service was exceptional The waiter Matt even told us what cuts were not the greatest and suggested better options that were actually less expensive. The ambience was nice and the food was fantastic. My filet melted in my mouth. The sashimi shooter appetizer was delicious. Mashed potatoes was were seasoned well and were creamy. I would come back here anytime when in Vegas, and I would request Matt as my waiter."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT food and service! We came here for a friend's bachelorette dinner before the Magic Mike show. We were greeted warmly by the hostess and she even recognized us after the show and asked how it went. 

I highly recommend and it was easily my favourite meal on this Vegas trip. 

I had the filet mignon and added the seared foie gras. The steak was perfectly cooked to a medium rare and incredibly flavourful - it went really well with the peppercorn sauce (which the server advised was the most popular). The foie gras was melt-in-your-mouth buttery, rich and decadent - easily in the top 5 best foie gras I've ever had. 

I also had the lobster mac and cheese, mushroom grits and brussel sprouts. The mushroom grits was the winner of the night in terms of sides. Very flavourful, creamy and the mushrooms were perfect. We were all really excited to try the lobster and mac and cheese but it turned out to be too heavy and creamy (this can sometimes be a bad thing). 

Service was impeccable, professional and top quality. Everything went smoothly without any hiccups. They surprised the entire table with complimentary shots, a very nice touch, thank you!"}
{"text":"\"I vote steak for dinner\" I say to three fellow poker buds.
 
\"Cow, I'm down\" says one.

\"Mooooooo\" says Midwest poker bud.

\"Uh guys, I became a vegetarian a month ago\" says SoCal poker dude.

\"Oh cool, if my dog gets sick, I'll call you.  Steak it is\", Midwest poker dude with a laugh.  And we're off (Not that we don't care but Vegetarian for a month?  Cheat Day!)

From the pedigree that brought us Morton's Steakhouse comes MB Steak.  The brothers, self proclaimed pioneers of the next \"classic\" steakhouse,  and why not, N9NE at the Palms is one of their ventures.  So?

A contemporary steakhouse with a true Vegas vibe whose food is clearly centered around millennial's, all the right hot ingredients seasoned and prepared just a touch different to make them seem apart from daddy's steakhouse.  Jokes on them, as the old becomes retro chic.  Sauces, crusts, and the heavy herb seasoning's of the 1970s are back.

Starters include an excellent charred Spanish octopus. Tender chunks of grilled octopus atop a stewed tomato port wine reduction.  Sweet, acidic, bitter all work to bring out the oceanic flavor..  The foie, solid.  Seared, its fat dripping over a gently sweeten brioche French toast and soaking into macerated strawberries. A Sherry reduction adds the classic nuttiness that rounds out the dish.  The \"bacon and eggs\" thick cut grilled maple bacon, its dripping fat, a pile of frisée, topped off by a soft poached egg. Break the egg, mix it all up, a rich, satisfying warm salad.

The main attractions, the steaks. Offered both wet and dry aged USDA prime, or American, Australian, and Japanese wagyu.  This being a first try, we stuck to the American classics.  In general, the steaks are well trimmed, relatively evenly cooked with a good sear.  One level over temp through the center though the steaks maintained their tenderness and juiciness.  Seasoning is aggressive and peppery.  It works for the thick Tomahawk, flavoring it to its core and complimenting the gentle dry aged funk.  The dry aging is not overpowering.  In comparison, the porterhouse showcases classic American beef flavor.

Note:  will update this review after sampling the signature bone in short rib.

Standard steakhouse sides. Solid Yukon mash, very good maitakes that went well with the dry aged tomahawk.  The standout, the lobster mac & cheese.  Though slightly overcooked, a pile of lobster tail meat atop a very rich mac & cheese.  Heaven.  It works well with the beef, enhancing its natural sweetness.

Correct service but the performance still needs work, opening jitters that should go away with time.

Good wine list.  Typical Vegas resort markup.

A worthy upper mid tier steakhouse.  Solid but IMHO does not break into the Vegas top five."}
{"text":"I'm a local, so I have the benefit of having eaten at steakhouses all over Las Vegas, on and off the Strip.  MB Steak was a pleasant surprise since I was expecting the \"Strip\" experience.  For locals, this usually means an overpriced menu and service that is less friendly.

First, we were greeted warmly and seated immediately at our reservation time.  The space is intimate, dark earthtones, faux leather booths and tables with comfortable chairs.  The interior space feels like a private club, away from the bustle of the casino.

Service was outstanding - every member of the staff was attentive and warm.  

And the food...wonderful.  I split a porterhouse with my companion.  It was cooked perfectly, sliced and served with house seasonings which included rock salt and pepper, as well as a house sauce.  Delicious and flavorful.  We had Au gratin potatoes, roasted cauliflower and brussel sprouts for sides.  Each was plentiful and well-done.  Everything about the food was perfect.

I was pleasantly surprised at the overall experience and I can't wait to go back to MB Steak.  I can see why it is consistently rated so high!"}
{"text":"was at hard rock for the porn star expo and awards when some fans invited me to dinner we ate at the bar (was yesterday 1/24) now as a porn star our personal identity is very sacred and we have stage names for a reason . the bartender every chance he got after checking my id was loading telling everyone my real name. this is truly a safety and security breach, i'm supposed to feel protected by my identity and he kept say oh we're eating w (my name) yes (my name) is in the building.. oh (my name) will treat u right any given way this bartender could said my full name to any stalker or patron around and the guys who invited me out spent almost 800 between the 4 of us. i will never bring anyone nor recommend any person who woshes their name not be told to the world to go there. the entire hotel is full of people who do not wish the public to know who they are and what if these men had figured out w the info the bar guy freely gave where i lived w my kids and something happened go my family or myself. completely disrespectful and ive never had this happen do not eat there"}
{"text":"Talk about fantastic steak, wow, the Rib eye was cooked to perfection as well as the Hanger steak , they cook to your request , the sides were a wonderful and delightful treat , the creamed  spinach , mushrooms, au gratin potatoes as well as the mushroom cheese grits were all perfect. 
will go back again , the service was beyond comparison, Mack was perfect and so attentive and fast to cover our needs."}
{"text":"When The Hard Rock Hotel & Casino decided to close 35 Steaks + Martinis in favor of a more casual concept to serve their Rehab Pool crowd the move was frustrating, but made sense, and even though the work Marty and Michael were doing there will likely never be replicated by any Steakhouse in Sin City the Casino's newest idea, MB|Steak from the descendents of Morton's proved compelling enough to sit down for Sunday dinner alongside property-wide Executive Chef Bradley Manchester

Located just off the gaming floor, a still-bustling Oyster Bar to one side and recently launched Magic Mike Live on the other, MB|Steak officially opened in mid-May 2017 and described as a concept created by the Morton Brothers to \"bring the best memories of [their] family's history to life\" those dining within its heavily wooded confines will find nearly no detail overlooked, the low ceilings reminiscent of Chicago Steakhouses of the past and the menu veering wide, but not so much that it ever loses its path

Toqued by Patrick Anthony Munster, the St. Louis native who cut his teeth at SW Steakhouse for over a decade moving back to a proper Steakhouse closer to the Strip after a brief stint with Clique Hospitality at Bottiglia, it was with the Chef enjoying a day off that a party of two checked in at the hostess podium before being led past the first of two bars and a staircase that takes guests to an upstairs lounge with living walls and city views, the dining room a bit stark at 5:30 but filling up to about 2/3 capacity by the time a 140 minute feast was completed.

Following a traditional route in offering Appetizers, Steaks, Entrees and Sides, luxury ingredients present in a similar manner to Munster's former digs as first courses, additions to cuts of Beef and toppings to traditional comfort foods, it was with Cocktails and Wine declined that the menu was perused in search of items both classic and distinctive, a plate of housemade Focaccia with caramelized Cheddar similar but surprisingly even better than the Bacon and Cheddar Roll enjoyed at SW less than 24 hours prior

Keeping the volume low and lighting moody, a central chandelier shaped like something one might see in Game of Thrones with spiky projections of black metal and decorative LED bulbs pointed inward or up, it was with greetings from the manager and several familiar faces from 35 Steaks that a lengthy conversation about travel, family and the property's ongoing renovations passed time before first courses arrived, the Caviar \"sliders\" an interesting idea at $7 each with ring-cut Buckwheat circles supporting briny black Eggs, a crisp Potato plus a dollop of Crème Fraiche

Not going too far left of center in the offerings, an elongated plate of Spanish Octopus with Broccolini and Tomatoes slightly tough despite a good char and great flavor, those looking for something more decadent would be well advised to order Chef Munster's Foie Gras that plates quite similar to the one at SW Steakhouse for 25% less, the exterior better caramelized and the portion around an ounce larger

Opting to also make the entrée Risotto a starter, the creamy bowl of rice imbued with Mascarpone cooked as well as any in town with English Peas, Roasted Onions and a half-dozen plump Shrimp, it was with some bites of the dish still lingering that plates were re-set to prepare for main courses, two Steaks, four Sides and a trio of Sauces literally showing the kitchen cooking with fire as both the Rib-Eye and Dry-Aged New York featured a good crust and medium-rare center with the later nearly as robust as Carnevino's version and far more complex than that at Wynn where the exact same 18oz Steak will cost guests $14 extra

Enjoying the Bordelaise the and Peppercorn Sauces plenty, though the house Steak Sauce trends a little too sweet, those who get excited for novel sides will be happy to see MB|Steak has its own take on classics dialed up, the Creamed Spinach with a Poached Egg and stretchy Cheese a reference standard side that tops any tasted in Sin City to date while the Mushroom Grits and Lobster Macaroni and Cheese also justify their cost by way of great flavors and good textures, the Creamed Corn unfortunately a bit too finely ground with the roasted Pepper somewhat overwhelming the generous chunks of Crab

Turning to Hard Rock Pastry Chef Mickey Harden for sweets; everything else including the Bread made on-site as MB|Steak is not officially 'owned' by the Hotel & Casino, it is perhaps a bit surprising that the Morton Brothers decided to go straight-classic for Dessert when Chef Harden has proven quite creative elsewhere, though this small quibble is immediately forgotten when the $16 wedge of New York Style Cheesecake and eight-layer Carrot Cake arrive, each undoubtedly intended to be shared as they are listed \"for two,\" though each are easily amongst the Valley's best and despite their large portions something one may want to peril taking a run at solo"}
{"text":"Steakhouses are prominent in this town, but few are sophisticated with a stunning setting such as MB steakhouse. 
An exceptional wine list and enticing cocktail list.  
An exceptional dining experience with delicious meals and personable service.  The bar area is spacious and ideal for an intimate setting for two or a larger group.  The dining area is ideal for both as well. 
My friend is Vegan and they accommodated her with a scrumptious risotto.  We we. For the Magic Mike cocktails- had me at cotton candy!
MB serves mouth-watering appetizers and entrees, oh yes and the sweet ending milkshakes & desserts:)  
Whichever menu items you choose, I'm quite sure they will dazzle your palate."}
{"text":"Morton brothers do not let down! The Tomahawk steak was to die for! There was so much else to enjoy but I had to give that a try and it did its duty. Very beautiful ambiance as well and I really am looking forward on returning here once more!"}
{"text":"Amazing steakhouse. 1st time really trying anything \"off\" The Strip. Place is very loud, but we really enjoyed the environment, if you're looking for an intimate romantic quiet steakhouse this is not it (reminds me of STK at Cosmo). Service is top shelf!!!  For drinks my wife and niece had some type of house special martinis while I had my typical Old Fashioned double. One of the better old fashioned I've had...highly recommend. For appetizers we had the octopus, that's prepared incredible, not too \"rubbery\" on an awesome sauce. Wife and niece had oysters which they both loved. For the main course wife had the Dry Aged NY. She probably only finished half but loved it. I had the 8 oz filet with lobster. It was really good. Still think StripHouse at Planet Hollywood has the bat but this was definitely right up there. My niece had the Salmon and that was prepared very well and was a surprisingly big portion. The girls called it off with carrot cake. Overall this is one of our favorite steakhouses, restaurants and experiences so far."}
{"text":"Get here now!

Morton brothers first endeavor together and they nailed it.

Decor was tasteful, great vibe, friendly staff and solid food. Stepped in after an event to have a few bites in the lounge. The menu is your standard steakhouse menu with a few different offerings but nothing to deter you away from trying any of them.

Grilled bacon, crab cakes, octopus and chopped salad is what was ordered along with a few cocktails.

Everything was seasoned perfectly and everything at the proper temperature.  

The meat doesn't differ from any others on or off the strip but originally and hospitality do and they have it"}
{"text":"The hostess was super friendly, the dining room looked stunning. I was spoiled by the knowledgeable server, my mom and I wanted to share a steak steak for her birthday and we ordered the porterhouse with that crust it was spectacular! I almost forgot about the mouth watering cheesecake with a warm caramel banana sauce. Great restaurant we'll be returning"}
{"text":"Met up with a friend at the Hard Rock and originally was going to dine at the Oyster Bar but the line was way to long so so we decided to try MB. We were able to get right in without a reservation.  We shared everything. Octopus was cooked to perfection, tomatoes in the tomato salad were a bit to cold for me but overall dish was good.  Risotto was a bit over cooked & mushy. Dry aged New York was spot on in terms of temperature & flavor. I will have to say the carrot cake was the best I have ever had. I would defiantly recommend this place."}
