{"text":"Who would've known?! There is signage from the road, in fact as I walked up to the Shell gas station, this place is housed in I was still worried this place had closed down. But once you open the doors to the Shell, all your worries disappear.  When I went there was only one person working. He made the food and worked the register. The have a couple of table with bar stools, I think 4 total.   I ordered the special breakfast burrito it was full of all kinds of meat (chorizo & bacon for sure) the other person I was with ordered a bacon burrito. Both burritos were full of flavor.   If I was looking for a breakfast burrito place this is pretty yummy. Because they make it when you order it, does take some time so make sure to account for that."}
{"text":"A Mexican restaurant inside a gas station? Why yes!!! Don't let the location stop you from trying this place... This is some of the best authentic homemade Mexican food you can get!   We have visited here many times and have never been disappointed with anything we have ordered. My favorite, by far, is the Navajo taco with half green & half red! The carne asada burrito is also fantastic! Everything is fresh and made to order.   The owner, Dave, and his wife are always manning the counter and are so friendly and welcoming!   Maganas is now one of our favorite go to Mexican places, we have only been there for lunch and dinner but looking forward for trying out their breakfast items! So happy we stumbled on this delicious diamond!"}
