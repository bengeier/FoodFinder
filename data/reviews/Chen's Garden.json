This is our FAVORITE, \"Go to\" restaurant in AZ!  Been fans for ELEVEN years!!!

Food always tastes excellent.  Chefs even customize some of their dishes for us (like adding extra egg; or not using water chestnuts; or adding extra cilantro; etc.) We have too many favorites to list here...  Great Hot & Sour soup; Great pork buns; Great eggplant or Green Beans; Mongolian Beef;Shrimp w. walnuts; etc. -- you get the idea.

Portions are generous; prices are totally reasonable; GREAT operating hours; casual \"family\" and \"tourist\" style ambience; FAST service; NICE staff!!!

We eat here almost every day!!"}
{"text":"I am trying to think of something positive to start my review off with, so I'll say it was super cheap, but that's all I can put in the \"plus\" column. This was hands-down the worst Chinese food I've ever had. I stopped for lunch, and had the lunch special of chicken with vegetables combo, which came with fried rice, egg drop soup, and an eggroll. First the soup came, and while it had lots of vegetables in it, it really tasted mostly like the can it came out of. The fried rice was fairly flavorless, but what little flavor there was wasn't pleasant. The chicken with mixed vegetables wasn't that bad, except that the brown sauce was extremely salty. My server was plenty attentive, filling my iced tea a couple of times, but she seemed very surly and I don't think she smiled once the whole time I was there. I gave her a big tip because the total of my bill was only $7.35, and I felt like a 20% tip would be such a pittance it would embarrass me. When I went to use the restroom, I saw what I thought were mouse droppings on the floor, but a closer look revealed them to be small dead bugs of some sort. Better, in my opinion, than mouse droppings for sure, but still not a welcome sight in a restaurant where I just ate. I'm sorry to say I won't be back, not because of the service but because of the poor quality of the food."}
{"text":"my favorite restaurant. i always get the coconut curry chicken with bamboo shoots. its honestly the best thing EVERR!!"}
{"text":"BEST CHINESE IN TOWN! Everything is the best quality, you can tell they just made it, and it's reasonably priced. Love this place, never getting Chinese any where else."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food around! I love this place! They are fast friendly and efficient. The prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is not good. If you're Asian you will not like this place and think this place is very Western. The owners clearly cater to the White clientele of the area. Nothing here is authentic. For example I was served Pringles with my salt and pepper calamari. 

I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is always on point. Not pricey, super good food. Staff is attentive but not over bearing. But honestly the main reason to come is the food. There usually isn't a lot of customers so it kinda feels like you've got the place to yourself. Seriously if you're in the fountain hills area check them out."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant based on other reviews. Sadly, it just did not live up to my expectations! My husband and I ordered carryout and found both of our dishes to be watery and bland. The portions were large, but we could not get past the tasteless vegetables and sauce. The dumplings we ordered as an appetizer were good though!  I do have to say that the online ordering feature was pretty cool, but its not nearly enough to make up for the poor food quality."}
{"text":"Cheap, greasy subpar food but you get what you pay for.  The ladies at the counter are not friendly, but the place is always busy and if you are in the mood for a cheap meal then this is the place.  NOT the best Chinese place around, but will do in a budgetary pinch."}
{"text":"You could get better food from a concentration camp. I'm not sure how this place stays open."}
{"text":"The best Chinese take out and delivery! Food is always hot ! We have never had a bad meal!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food around. AND they deliver....AND they have never gotten my order wrong.  Amazing!"}
{"text":"Great value for lunch.  It a 'dive diner' meets 'chinese restaurant'.

FOOD: Food was good.  Not amazing, not awful, but pretty good.

ATMOSPHERE: Very, very small dining room with dusty 1980's decor. 

SERVICE: We placed our food orders and the waitress walked away.  We had to call her back to remind her that we wanted drinks also and she seemed bothered by this."}
{"text":"Never thought to try this place and read the reviews here. I'm glad I did! Food was great, portions are enormous, and it was ready very quickly! I will be back for sure! Even my 8 year old declared it was the best Lo mein ever!"}
{"text":"My family and I love Chen's. it is exactly what you would hope for when you order Chinese takeout. Food is made quickly to order, the kitchen is always bustling and they don't mess around. 

They often answer the phone and put you right on hold. Don't be offended by this, its proof that they are one of the best take out places in town. They will come back shortly and ask for your order. 

I love the general tso chicken, fried rice, crab Rangoon, and noodles. Plus if you spend $15 or more they give you free crab rangoon upon request."}
{"text":"Yaaaaaa. General Tsos Chicken--- just breading mostly now.  Chicken noodle soup broth had NO flavor. 
Idk what it is... I think this is a family operated place and they switch out who's there at times.  Sometimes the food is great-- other times, not so much. 
I got the Mai Fun chicken with added shrimp and it was all noodles. Hardly any chicken and the shrimp I paid extra for were tiny. No veggies either. 
I won't be ordering anymore for real now. As I stated earlier, General Tso chicken is all breading and no chicken. So sad. 
My daughter won't ever let me order it anyhow after a moth was found in her steamed dumplings. Lol. Whoops
Oh well. It's bad for the figure and health anyhow with all the MSG......"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in the famous Fountain Park area in a small freestanding building. We  heard from my Uber driver that this place had good lunch specials so we decided to try it.

The restaurant is separated into two areas, the front dining area and the back dining area. When we entered nobody greeted us because nobody was eating or present in the front of the restaurant.

So we waited in the front area for about two minutes and were about to turn around and leave when the waitress came out. She handed us two menus and opened the door to the back dining room. There were about 3 tables of diners sitting in the back dining area. Needless to say there was no privacy between the tables as it's a pretty cramped dining room.

We decided to keep it simple and only order the kung pao chicken lunch special. The menu had a lot of lunch specials all under $6.00 but we wanted to order just something basic because we've already experienced quite a few bad Chinese restaurant in AZ.

The lunch special came with hot and sour soup, wontons and an egg roll. All the food came out nice and hot. I'm a stickler for hot food so I thought this was a great start.

The hot and sour soup tasted like hot and sour soup always does, so I didn't expect anything special.  I'm not sure what region this cooking came from but the kung pao chicken while it was a hearty portion and looked inviting, it was heavily drenched in a very familiar sauce. If I had to pin point it to describe it, it basically tasted like hot and sour soup was poured over it. 

While we picked at it even though it was overwhelming saucy and had no distinct flavor to it, it did have a nice amount of chicken in it. The food didn't meet our standards of what good quality Chinese food is but if you're looking for a quick place to have lunch for under $8.00 this is that place."}
{"text":"This place is ok the sizzling fried rice soup is served in a huge bowl with mainly water and vegetables. what I dont like is they only add 3 pieces of chicken and a few pieces of shrimp for $6 they should add more meat. Instead of having people pay to get chicken and shrimp put in their soup or lower the price since its mainly water. Well they have good lunch special s I would recommend."}
{"text":"I can't believe how long its been since a review has been written for this restaurant.  Not by me, but by others. 
Look, an authentic Chinese restaurant it's not.  Amazing food, it is not.  It is average chinese food intended for non-asians.  Period.  Clean place, polite and attentive servers.  We had egg drop soup; hot, with frozen veggies, broth lacked flavor.  $5.50 for lunch combo which included soup, vegetable fried rice, chicken chow mein, veggie egg roll and fried wontons.  Vegetable fried rice was nothing to write home about.  Chow mein was fine except maybe a tad too sweet.  Veggie roll was good.  All in all--what does anyone want for $5.50 when it includes all of these items.  If these people were super star chefs, it would be reflected in the price as is the case in many scottsdale chinese eateries.  We were in the area, we dropped by and fed our faces in an inexpensive,  clean,and friendly environment.  Nice people."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews, but I had to so that people would know this place is NOT a 4 star worthy Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Hungry for good Chinese food? This is the place! Have eaten here many times, never disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant in cuyahoga falls.
Excellent staff, friendly and quick.
Clean interior.
Hot food and no issues with orders. 
Good food comes out as ordered and looks just as it should . Prices are decent as well. 
Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I was shocked that I could get good take out of dine in Chinese food so close to home! I was lucky to have had fast service on this busy weekday. The special was Pine nut shrimp and it was excellent. A nice amount of shrimp, albeit they were probably farm raised in Thailand, and great assortment of vegetables other than onions! It came with a few crispy things and a side of soup. The hot and sour was just right and had nicely chopped small amount of veggies in it too."}
{"text":"Not bad but not too good for what I order. I always order something that's not on the menu but can be easily made by chinese restaurants. I'm a vegetarian but I don't like salads. Pretty much the only thing I ever order at chinese spots is general tso's tofu. It's just like the chicken verson of the dish just with tofu instead. I'm from NYC and we have a chinese restaurant on every other block over there so maybe I'm spoiled but I have never had what I always order taste as bad as it does here. The taste was bland and the tofu wasnt fried the way it usually is at every other chinese restaurant ive been to and to top ot all off the amount of food they give you here is very little. I got less tofu than rice and the rice was even kid sized. Im 6 ft 2 inches i was nowhere near full. The price was twice the amount that i normally pay for the dish and the portion of the food was 1/4th the size that i usually get. My girl loves eating here hence the three stars but I cant recommend it at all. My girl always gets their sizzling rice soup which she cant get enough of. I havent tried it since its filled with shrimp and chicken and I'm vegetarian. Maybe it's worth going but only for that soup but I cant say that for sure. Sidenote - for some reason the only waitress they have always has an angry look on her face but she never says anything rude but that look has to go. I wish she smiled every once in a while or just didnt look so mean."}
{"text":"I love this place - my husband and i get takeout every week. I love their wonton soup, the egg rolls, the crab puffs. It's all delicious and the lady who owns the place is so nice. I have eaten here for at least five years and it's always good."}
{"text":"Not really impressed by the food. I had the fried pot stickers, egg rolls, General Tso chicken with fried rice. The egg rolls were probably the best tasting but were nothing special; could achieve same thing from freezer isle and deep frier. The fried rice is not what I am accustomed to being called fried rice. Wegman's has way better General Tso chicken. Best part about this place is they deliver."}
{"text":"I ordered general tso chicken, something I order at almost every Chinese restaurant I get take out from, but it tasted nothing like it should. It almost had a bbq taste to it. My fried rice was undercooked (or just old, because it was hard) and it ws yellow? The sweet n sour sauce was like a red, thick and sticky syrup. Will not be returning. I mean, how hard is it to mess up Chinese takeout?"}
{"text":"Old school American Chinese food. Delicious veg stir fry,dun dun noodles. And chicken shrimp special. Very inexpensive,and very substantial portions. Chinese food not fusion. Enjoyed our lunch today. Will be back"}
{"text":"They taste of the food was below average. Fried rice was yellow rice and it was hard. We ordered crab Rangoon and they sent cheese wontons. Sweet and sour shrimp was mostly batter. They only do cash delivery. Just not a great experience."}
{"text":"Speedy delivery of great food! I really like their cheesy wootons. If you want chopsticks you must request them."}
{"text":"Excellent value portions.  Food variety is typical for Chinese carryout but everything is good.   Fridays are very busy so there can be longer pickup times."}
{"text":"Delivery person also forgot my drink in car. I called and got it in 10 min or so. 

Then I noticed my general szo chicken was very hard and tasted burnt. I called again, and they said they'd replace it. They got it to me within the same hour and asked to take the bad general szo. Overall, they were pretty nice about it. Tell them how you want them to cook your food beforehand or else you'll go through this. Apparently they always make it pretty hard. My replacement was softer and had good flavor. 

Ordered online and they said it would be 45 min (ordered 3 entrees) but it was actually a 20 min wait, which was nice. Don't think I'll order from here unless too lazy and need delivery Chinese food."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese takeout, been ordering here for several years. I've gotten Chinese food all over the nation:  this place has the best food and service. You must try them."}
{"text":"Love this chinese restaurant,  I am almost going weekly now. Its mostly americanized chinese but if you want something different I would go for whatever the daily special is. Best time of the day to come is for lunch, for 5-6 dollars you get a good sized portion served with fried rice, an egg roll with fried wontons and a cup of soap. The outdoor seating area is quite pleasant and I have never had bad service and they place is always clean. Atmosphere is a little outdated but for the price its kind of expected."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese eateries around. I think they prices are reasonable, quality is above average and they even deliver cheap!"}
{"text":"Been going to this place of and on for a few years and every now and then I realize why I stopped going there this time it's for good. Very mediocre food I don't need the arrogance of the owner acting as though they're doing you a favor, so many wrong orders just to be told that it was my fault. My friends always remember there's a reason why a restaurant is 80% empty most of the time."}
{"text":"The sauce is too sweet. Asian food doesn't have that much sweetness added to it. I ordered something spicy and it wasn't very spicy."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. The food is always delicious, no matter what dish you choose. The lunch special comes with rice, soup, wontons, and an egg roll and it's around 5$! Literally can't beat that value. The staff is friendly and accommodating. My whole family loves dining here when we are in Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"Great food, huge portions and easily a 15 minute wait for take out as they are always busy! Definately a go to restaurant!"}
{"text":"This was my go-to Chinese spot when I lived in the Valley. It was close, great prices and good portions on the food. I loved the fried rice!

Very friendly staff and great amazing food!"}
{"text":"I will never understand what the hype is with this restaurant. 

I have tried this place many times over the years and it never blows my mind. In fact, I would say the quality has gone down significantly. 

I remember I used to order it a lot a few years ago because they would deliver to my work. It was always served hot and the delivery guy was always friendly. 

However, in the past year or so the food quality has really taken a decline. From the wonton soup, to the Hunan chicken, or broccoli beef, fried rice and lo mein... it's all mushy, awful, and flavorless. 

If you're looking for inexpensive, mall quality, MSG ridden American Chinese takeout... then look no further, because you'll love this place!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would. A co-worker of mine clued me in on this hidden gem. My first experience was on a Friday night and was shocked to hear them say pick up was 45 miuntes. I killed some time shopping and headed over. The staff was friendly (as friendly as they could be on a busy night I suppose). The food was worth the wait. It was excellent. I have ordered several times since and have not had a bad experiece yet and have told many people about them!"}
{"text":"I went into Chen's Garden to order some take out. Before I do my review, let it be known that I waitressed at an authentic Chinese and Thai restaurant in Columbus, OH for over a year, so my standards when it comes to Chinese food are somewhat high.

First off, the girls working here were extremely rude. They were short with me and my sister. The girl running the register became aggravated when I asked what vegetables were in the General Tso's. I firmly believe this is a valid because EVERY Chinese food place is different, it's not McDonald's, and their menu did not list any ingredients for any of the dishes. 

I told the girl that I'd like a few minutes to go over the menu, and that I'd let her know when I was ready so she could continue doing whatever. She kept getting more and more irritated and kept continually asking me every minute or so if I was ready to order. I let her know, again, that I wanted some time to go over the entire menu and that I'd never been there before and that I'd probably be a while. She went to the back, conversed with another girl in Chinese, then came back up to me and asked if I was ready. At this point, just to hurry up and appease her, I ordered Homestyle Vegetables cooked in a General Tso Sauce, add Tofu, and one order of General Tso's chicken for my younger sister.

The wait was fifteen minutes.

If I was disappointed in the service, it was nothing compared to the food. The vegetables were extremely over cooked, the sauce had no flavor, there was a ridiculous amount of MSG in the food, the girls bagged our fortune cookies at the bottom of the bag, crushing them with the take out boxes. The food containers were completely covered in sauce and filled up past the line, so that when you removed the lids, syrup ran down everything. There were no napkins in the bag at all.

After having waitressed, I am an extremely polite person, and I assure you, I was nothing but sweet to this girls, so I don't feel that they were singling me out by ill packaging, I just think they're either not very good at their job, or don't really care.

The food was syrupy, had no flavor, no spices, the tofu was sub par, the rice was older and drying out. We went in at around five o'clock on a Saturday. If that's the weekend quality, I'd hate to go for lunch.

Would NOT recommended to anyone who has any taste for actual Chinese food."}
{"text":"This place has been around longer than I've been calling this small town my home. Restaurant business is hard to survive in this town sometimes and for them to stay in business longer than I've been here, something must be good about this place.

 I came to pick up to go order the other day, it's been at least a few years since last time I dined here. 

Beef with garlic had a very nice flavor, I always enjoyed Singapore noodles, nice dinner size portion, I forgot how good their food was.

It is nice neighborhood Chinese. May not be the best but they've been offering good food for a long time"}
{"text":"chinese food is few and far between in the phoenix area, or so i am told.  this place is just eh.

i got the teriyaki chicken.  the chicken seemed like it was boiled, so the texture was bland, then the sauce was just plain.  sweet, no particular taste that wowed me.  i expect a grilled taste when i get teriyaki, so i was really disappointed.  i got the rice bowl option.  so they had the rice, then a pile of shredded cabbage, and then the chicken.  i spent forever picking the cabbage out.  who puts cabbage in a rice bowl?

my friend got the sesame chicken, which tasted like a light sweet and sour with sesame's on top.  it was good, wish i had gotten that instead of my selection.  

it was very cheap.  the lunch special was $3.95 for the rice bowl and $4.95 for the combo (soup, egg roll, a couple won tons, and fried rice)."}
{"text":"I ordered here once and it was amazing. Delivery guy was wonderful! The second time, the food was just as good! However I forgot to order my free generals with $25 so I called and the lady was insistent to deliver it to us (even though it was our fault). The delivery guy was super fast and he literally pushed my tip away because I tipped him well the first time.  

This place has went above and beyond amazing customer service and the food is just as great!!! I'm so happy to find a delicious Chinese takeout/delivery place with ABSOLUTELY AMAZING customer service! 

I will never eat at another local place. I am in love"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years & its great every time! The best crab rangoon around! You can order online now which is really convenient too! The family says it's the best general tso's but I love the chicken with black bean sauce (I order spicy)or Hunan chicken."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Chen's to become my go-to chinese food place, but I was disappointed. The egg drop soup had weird clear gelatinous globs in it. Yuck."}
{"text":"Best Chinese take-out in town. 

I'm picky when it comes to my Chinese food, I'm particular on my rice and my lo mein. This tiny little Chinese counter is authentic for sure, no other way to explain it. They're always fast-paced and busy as hell. People in and out all during the weekends. They also deliver, and since I live not that far away, they'll deliver to my house for a delivery fee of I think around $3.00, not bad. They're lo mein is my favorite, and the wonton soup is delicious as well. Hard to understand though, especially when calling in to place your takeout order, and like I said, FAST-PACED, they will definitely hurry you up. But most of it is to be expected, they're are usually always busy when I'm there, Fridays and Saturdays especially.

If your looking for a good, cheap authentic Chinese take-out diner, this is it. Not a \"must-try\" if you're passing through town, but definitely worth trying out if your a local and looking for a new favorite Chinese place in the area."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have never tried this cute little place!  What a hidden gem in fountain Hills!  It is now my new favorite Chinese restaurant locally!  Orange chicken was top notch!  Pot stickers were mouth watering and black pepper beef had flavor for days!  This will definitely be a once a week date night stop!  Make sure you stop and give them a try!  Also, service was exceptional and prices were good!  So happy we decided to try something new!"}
{"text":"The staff at the counter is not very friendly. The cut you off when ordering, hang up on you and make you repeat yourself quite a few times. The food is SO good though. We order from here all the time and haven't really had any complaints with food or delivery time."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for Chinese food. Probably the best you'll find in the area for the price. Delivery does take a lonnnngggg time, but it's worth the wait. Packaging can get a bit sloppy, but I'm not that particular about stuff like that when we're talking chinese take out...it's always about the FOOD! Which is amazing most of the time, emphasis on MOST. The general Tso's chicken is the reason I keep coming back, and their eggrolls are fantastic. Best chinese food you can get without spending a fortune and throwing on your good clothes.....go there, now."}
{"text":"First time using this place. Unorganized. Called in an order for pick up and they lost it. Hostess states she remembers taking my order. Instead of offering a discount or an apology, she just said, \"It will be a few minutes, thats $38.75.\" 

On the bright side, they do have beautiful fake flowers that you can look at on the tables while waiting for your order of food that they forgot about."}
{"text":"The food is great and is worth the money!! Only thing, the woman who runs it was rude and delivery takes a while. And along with the delivery charge that is supposed to cover gas and tip, after giving an additional dollar tip they sulk away as if they deserved more for a five minute drive."}
{"text":"Since it was COLD on Friday, my wife and I decided to go to Chen's for lunch. I don't know why we didn't think of Pei Wei but this restaurant is much closer to our house. 
My wife ordered the Chicken Rice Bowl and I ordered the Chicken with Rice Noodles off the Lunch menu. It came with egg flower soup which was nice an hot. When my meal came, I can't figure out why they would give me fried rice with noodles...double the starch. I really enjoyed it. The egg roll was made with just vegetables...so, so. But I didn't like the fried Won Ton which was crispy on the outside but REALLY dry on the inside. Can't complain for two hot meals under $10."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced dinners coupled with a lunch special that is a steal, Chen's Garden offers a quick solution to the average Chinese food craving. The service is quick and reasonably friendly. The atmosphere is nothing to write home about, but the restaurant is clean and comfortable. Fountain Hills has been waiting for this affordable alternative to its typically overpriced options."}
{"text":"The food is very good and very reasonably priced.  The atmosphere... well, there really isn't any.  Service was very efficient though not friendly but the food is great and the lunch specials can't be beat.  Less than $15 for two including tax for a delicious lunch.  I'll be back, friendly service or not."}
{"text":"Great cheap Chinese food! A solid go to on a night in. Love the Teriyaki beef sticks and chicken fried rice. The beef and broccoli is another great choice, just about any dish you order you won't be able to finish. We love Chen's Garden"}
{"text":"We have ordered from Chen's quite a few times. The food has always been tasty & still steaming hot when they deliver it. If you order from their website, you can get a free order of cheese wonton after $15 or an order of general tso chicken after $25."}
{"text":"I have never been inside the restaurant but I order delivery from there all the time. The food is always good. I've never had a problem with my order. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"It's ok. Typical Chinese carry out and very quick. My biggest complaint is the quality of the ingredients. The vegetables taste like they were dumped out of a frozen bag and the meat quality is fairly low. Id happily pay a little more for better quality. Right now I haven't found a better place close by."}
{"text":"I really, really want to like this place, but after several attempts I can not pretend any longer. The girls who work the phones and register are so abrupt you truly feel like you are an interruption to their day. Other people mention how friendly they are, but I've yet to see it after at least a dozen separate orders.

The food is subpar at best. Their dishes lack flavor in general. Their hot & sour soup is only sour and their chicken with cashews is bland.

Others mentioned issues with packaging and slow delivery. My packaging has always been fine & their delivery from an online order was super fast."}
{"text":"I love that you can order online and that they deliver! The food was amazing! No complaints at all - big portions and the shrimp foo young was spectacular!"}
{"text":"Somewhat reasonable, food could be better but is better than anything I've found or sampled in the sounding area with exception of P.F. Chang's. Appears to be busy every time I've stopped by and I understand they deliver too."}
{"text":"great prices, great tea and AMAZING FOOD!

the combo plate is AMAZING and fills you up and well priced!

I love coming here!!!!"}
{"text":"Their food is usually really great, but lately it has been either over cooked or under cooked. I asked for extra soy sauce only for a 3 person meal, I received 2 packets of soy sauce and 1 packet of mustard and duck sauce....Really? You could have saved the duck sauce and mustard, and gave me more soy sauce and maybe a napkin or a fork."}
{"text":"The best Chinese restaurant in Fountain Hills. 

The lunch specials are pretty amazing. You get a cup of soup (either hot & sour or egg drop), a wonton, spring roll, small side of fried rice, and your entree. And....it's about $6 or $7 with a drink. 

Dinner-wise everything is pretty fresh and tasty. I have had a plethora of items here. My favorite is the Kung Pao tofu and their egg drop soup is really really good. The west lake soup is really good, but it has meat in it. 

Atmosphere-wise, this place lacks severely in that department, but who cares if the food is good. I like this place for take out."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from this place today.  It was the best Chinese delivery we have ever had.  The food arrived fresh an pipping hot and everything was delicious.  Better then any buffet!"}
{"text":"Boneless spare ribs the best I have ever had. Avoid beef (I usually love) but no flavor. Everything else we had was great. Worth the trip or call. They deliver."}
{"text":"The food is okay enough but I didn't appreciate the rude treatment I received when I placed a  order for take-out. Because of that, I'll never eat here again."}
{"text":"Might be the worst takeout Chinese I've ever had. Chicken was over cooked and chewy, fried rice was not actually fried rice but yellow rice with some peas."}
{"text":"I had posted on Facebook  that l was looking for recommendations for takeout and hands down Chen's in the Falls won. Anytime I have ordered Chinese this is my go to  fresh and really enjoy lo mein and egg roll  
The only negative  they do not have late hours I have driven by 8p some evenings and closed"}
{"text":"Love their food. They are so friendly and they give great service. Tried all the Asian restaurants here in fountain hills and Chens is the best food at great prices. Thank you for all you do. I'm such a regular the owners know me and my order to the tee"}
