{"text":"The staff are wonderful here, always smiling and happy to serve you. The food is delicious, and well priced."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday I expected it to be busy as breakfast  places usually are on the weekend. 
It was so busy and overly crowded  at the front door which made it very hard for the staff to pick up food and get around the patrons that were waiting to be  seated. 
(mind you the restaurant was also very small) 

So we decided to take the food to go 
Aside from all that...  The food was delicious!  
Amazing portions..  And the staff was very friendly. 

I will definelty be returning!"}
{"text":"I stayed at a hotel nearby and yelp led me to this cozy little breakfast diner. Food was inexpensive and portion was big. The 3 eggs egg benedict was pretty impressive. It was definitely much better than what I could have at the hotel and lasted me until I flew back to the west coast. Will definitive come back next time."}
{"text":"If you want good, greasy food, it's pretty good.  A little cluttered when you walk in but just order your food and sit down somewhere and the food will appear relatively fast.
I had the Club (as usually when trying a new place) and the chicken was real and so was the bacon, which is better than most places lately."}
{"text":"A mom and pop's shop
Dont expect much atmosphere
Friendly waitresses
Decent food for a good price
I had the eggs benedict, the potatoes were good, the hollandaise sauce was decent,  bottomless coffee was a good kicker"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service...can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Pros:  great food, decent portions, good service
Cons: a bit over priced and small place which can lead to long line ups.

Over all a decent place to eat once in a while."}
{"text":"Sept. 30/12 - This was our first time at Skyway Jacks. Drove into the parking lot and there was garbage strewn all over the lot.

The food items are posted on the walls, below the cash register, etc. You order before you sit down. Grabbed a take-out menu and was told the prices were old. When I asked the cashier whether the home fries were pan fried or deep fried, she replied \"deep fried, we don't have time on the weekend\". The other person who happened to be beside the cashier remarked that we can go somewhere else to which I replied, \"you're rude\". Ordered rye toast and found out by looking at the receipt that they charge 25 cents extra. The order came fairly quickly but the greek omelette that I ordered was bland with green tomatoes.

My impression was that they try to get as many people in and out as possible and they don't have time for their customers.

Needless to say, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Wanted to see what the hype was all about. Ordered the Steak Benedict. Food was quick and fresh but the hollandaise sauce wasn't great and unfortunately with Eggs Benedict it's what either makes or breaks the meal. Next time maybe I'll try one of the other 100 breakfast menu items."}
{"text":"This place used to be my SPOT. Huge portions, cheap prices. Seating is limited so expect a wait. I find lately they've been hit and miss with the french toast and pancakes eg sometimes too eggy or doughy, so I stopped going. The wait staff are super nice, give em a good tip!"}
{"text":"Best greasy spoons breakfast in town. They are family owned and it has that feel to it when you are there. All day breakfast with many options and they have the best pancakes. I've only had breakfast there but I here their burgers are pretty good. Service is good. Sofia who works there makes you feel so welcomed. They are often very busy but you never wait too long for a table. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Big portions, friendly staff, tasty dishes. On the pricier side for a family-run greasy spoon but I'd rather pay the slight premium for the quality. We will come back."}
{"text":"Breakfast variety is so big!  Maybe even too big, it's hard to make a decision.  The prices were a bit high though for breakfast foods but it was delicious."}
{"text":"If you just want basic breakfast food, cheap, then this is the place to go. The pictures capture it all. My rating is based on the fact that the food is so simple, you could make it at home no problem, although it is tasty for what it is. The place is an off-the beaten track dive diner. It's not worth the trip in my opinion. But again, if you want just basic breakfast food at low cost with little concern for the surroundings, this is just for you. I want a little more when I go out for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great food great place, small but warm and a friendly environment, the freshly squeezed orange juice is just spectacular (and pricey) but it's worth trying it out."}
{"text":"Looking for a cheap quick bite in North Mississauga?  Skyway Jack's is your place!  They have killer breakfast specials for under $6!  You can not go wrong.  This place gets busy during lunch.

I love their old school ordering process - you pay first what you order before grabbing a table.
Service is quick once you place your order.

They also have daily specials so keep an eye out for their special board when you walk in.

I will be back for more breakfast lunches! :)"}
{"text":"Not every breakfast joint is the same and this place proves just that! Great menu, delicious homemade fresh food, friendly family of staff and fair pricing! Great place to start a family tradition for a weekend breakfast! They are sure to remember your name! Love Skyway's!!"}
{"text":"Nice, busy and cheap....three words sum up the whole place. You have to order as soon as you get in at the counter and then they will give you the receipt to put at you table. The waiters take care of the rest.

The food is quite cheap, filling and warm. The egg was cooked well and the portions were quite on the heavy side. 

The service was quick and friendly. Parking is not a problem as this is part of a plaza.

All in all this place is easy on the pockets and heavy on the tummy!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast joint in Mississauga.

Friendly staff, amazing food coming fast out of the kitchen, and great prices. Will definitely be back for more Eggs Benny!"}
{"text":"Unique breakfast place among the Mississauga breakfast crowd. It's also very popular despite it's small size. It has good breakfast food but I find the food a bit too greasy and the seating area is very limited."}
{"text":"I must add my two cents here.. i live down the street and I must say this place sucks! the food is bland and very \"heavy\".. but what really sucks is the staff!! I can understand the food part, after all you are eating at a greasy spoon, but its the unfriendly staff.. i live across the street so naturally i started to have breakfast here a few times a week.. you think the staff would recognize me and say hello at least.. NO!! Business is too good anyway so why bother right? On principal I stopped giving these rude people my money for sub par food!! They serve enough calories on one plate to hold you for the day!! Eat here and you will get fat!

Two thumbs down! ..crammed, dirty, and rude.. no thanks!!"}
{"text":"So I was driving around in Sauga, when I had the sudden urge to eat a burger, and I guess what? I was passing Skyway Jack's so I stopped by for a quick bite.

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised, it was a really good burger for a diner, I was not expecting it be so nicely done, big and thick patty, nice and solid sesame seed bun with my choice of toppings

The girl at cash was very nice and polite, so all in all its was a very good experience

My order was just a plain ol' hamburger with water 7+

Enjoy"}
{"text":"So we're in the Mississauga area a lot to visit my father-in-law, and he loves this place.  It's definitely a greasy spoon.  Decent food, and lots of it, for a really low price.  He says it's better than Symposium.  (I completely  and wholeheartedly disagree.)  

I'm not sure how to describe my experience or exactly where I should start, but the food was okay, and the prices ridiculously cheap.  They claim to be \"the home of the healthy portions\", which you should take to mean \"home of the North American portions\", leaving you with really cheap food, and a lot of it, neither of which is very healthy.  

They have disturbing pictures and figures of smiling pigs and bags and bags of Dempster's bread sitting at the front.  You order your meal at the counter, sit down, and then they bring it to you.  I know I've said this already but I'll reiterate because I think it's important.  It's not that service or the food is bad, it's just mediocre.  I knew it was a greasy spoon going in, so I was expecting most of what I encountered, but when I ordered orange juice and was handed a bottled Minute Maid with my French toast and was brought No Name maple syrup still in the bottle, I just realized that this is not my kind of place.  That probably makes me sound like a snob, or an ass, but if I wanted shitty orange juice or shitty maple syrup, I wouldn't go out to eat.  That said, when I go out to eat I'm not expecting Grade A class organic maple syrup or fresh squeezed orange juice, but put my OJ in a glass and my syrup in a jar.  Dining out is about the atmosphere as well as the food, and that's important to me. 

All that said, if you enjoy greasy spoons, then you'd probably enjoy Skyway Jack's.  They serve all day breakfast and apparently in the mornings they are pretty packed, and sometimes you even have to park across the street in the plaza.  If the place is always packed, that has to mean something, it's just not my kind of place."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast to this place on Saturday morning and I'm glad I did! The staff were extremely friendly, the food tasted amazing, and the price was great! 

The restaurant was a little busy (around 11am) but we didn't have to wait long to order, get a table, and get our food brought to us (probably 15 minutes for all of that). As I mentioned before, the staff is extremely nice and friendly - the friendliest restaurant I've been to... Ever! 

There are a bunch of specials available for the breakfast. I ended up getting the skillet (beef) and was happy with the choice. I enjoyed the food will definitely go back to this restaurant if I am in the area again. 

Overall I would highly recommend this restaurant for breakfast to anyone in the area! Very happy with the food, service, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I could eat here once a week. For Streetsville, this place is pretty dope. It's a Mom & Pop, family owned kinda shop. You order your meal and they bring it out. The place is kinda small, but if you go at the right time, it's nice and chill. 

Here's the website for the Mississauga location: http://www.skywayjacks.com/skymenu/skyspecial1.htm

My usual order is the \"Country Style Benedict\" - 3 Eggs, 2 Sausage Patties on English Muffin w/ Hollandaise Sauce"}
{"text":"Would I come again? Nope.

Our order:
------------
- Hungry Man (three small eggs, two toast, home fries, beef burger patty with tomato) = $12
- Grand Slam (three small eggs, two bacon, two sausage, two pancakes) = $11

Pros:
------------
- More seating/quicker table turnover than you'd expect from a place this size (probably because of the \"pay first, then sit and eat\" system) 
- Service is really great. They're very friendly and quick. You order and they bring the food to your table.
- Food isn't bad

Cons:
------------
- Yes, food isn't bad, but it was so average that I genuinely feel I could have made everything in my dish better with little effort (e.g. Eggs were really small and so so dry, which is pretty basic in my experience and I'm hardly a chef) 
- I don't think you get value for money, but pricing is not far off from a breakfast chain (e.g. Egg Smart, Cora's). But we looked at the Hungry Man and were surprised it was considered a \"hungry\" portion. 
- Honey B Hives in Scarborough is far superior. Their \"hungry\" portion - the Working B Breakfast - comes with three regular sized eggs, home fries, three bacon, three sausage, three ham (you can pick three types of meat and you get three pieces of each), and three pancakes. And it's only $10 ($2 less than Skyway's Hungry Man)."}
{"text":"Skyway's is a mix between a fast food joint, and sit down restaurant. You order at cash, choose your seats then food is brought to your table.

I ordered the Canadian Skillet, (Mushrooms, Green peppers, Onions, Bacon, Cheese, Eggs, and Homefries). Now, I love me some bacon but man, this place loaded it like they we're dressing their turkey. I like my salt, so for those of you who don't, skip out. The homefries we're more like wedges with little to no seasoning, quite dissapointing. The server came by often to refill on Coffee, and was quick to clean when we finished. Service was friendly, and portions were definitely generous. The place is really run down, but if you get passed that, you'll really fall for its old charm. Portions are large enough to share for $9.99 I can't complain. 2 stars lost for having to order at cash, and for their wedges... I mean homefries. 

Fyi: Rye is an extra $.25"}
{"text":"Went there today and had a late breakfast. Heard good things about this place and had to try it out.  Amazing service and great food will definitely be back. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"All in all, the food lived up to quality and quantity. The only thing that would have played better in their portion preaching choir was if there was complimentary toast. Toast at a breakfast joint should be as complimentary as the jam in my opinion. The prices were fairly expensive for breakfast. Spending about 38$ for two people here is a bit much in my opinion.

{"text":"Very Rude lady Sophia (Sofia) spoiled our day.just now on Canada day me and my son went to have breakfast.ordered biggest Slap Jack breakfast and girl at front was very nice and we requested to replace bacon with one extra toast.Paid the money and when breakfast came there was sausage missing as breakfast comes with bacon and sausage and we only replaced bacon.A rude lady Sofia came while we were eating and said we are going to charge you for sausage and when I tried to explain She started shouting at me saying that she exactly know what we ordered and she was trying to shout at that nice girl too and I heard her saying to the girl \"I know exactly what you replaced and ordered\"as if she was trying to convince her not to say that she replaced only bacon and not sausage.Sofia was creating a scene there and I packed my food and came out and told her that I will put on social media how she treated us on  Canada day. then she said do you want  your money back.i refused and came home.they were not very busy today may be cause most people are out and she was showing her frustration may be.not sure.i would never go back.this is the food we packed and left the place without finishing eating.Sophia (Sofia)has no respect for anyone.so rude and disrespectful she could be on Canada day to spoil someone's day for a sausage.Can't Imagine we paid and were not asking anything free.Nice girl at front was not saying anything cause she knew what discussion we had and was quiet.She could not say anything to Sophia cause she raised her voice too much.Who is going to argue with her.we decided to leave rather then argue."}
{"text":"This place was cozy and warm (literally too). The staff were friendly, I mean SUPER friendly. They were kind and greeted my gf and I the moment of our appearance. The food was exceptional, even for a breakfast joint. I think the quality and freshness of the food totally blows cora's out of the water. The eggs were white and solid, perfect for sunnyside. The portion was good size too, considering I only spent $6.75 on it. You don't get 4 sausages anywhere in Toronto, unless you order the more expensive breakfasts.. This place came with 4,which caught me off guard. I'm a breakfast kind of guy.. So that just made it even better!"}
{"text":"fast breakfast joint that's worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Service here is always great, small family own feel to it! They laugh with their customers which many are regulars due to the fair prices and large portions. 

Cafeteria style where you line up order then grab a seat. Sometimes they will seat you on weekends and it's super busy. The service is fast so the turn over is normally quick enough that you don't wait much. Old diner feel to the inside too. 

The food is greasy diner food but like mentioned before portion is almost always too much for 1 to finish. Home fries are delish! 

Their specials are great during the week!"}
{"text":"I dunno...it's a place that my wife loves but I'm not super crazy about. Yeah it's pretty cheap and yeah the portions are pretty impressive but to me it's just your average greasy spook breakfast joint and not worth going out of your way to frequent. And seeing as I'm not usually in Streetsville and am NOT a morning person in the slightest, I'm far more inclined to seek out one of the places in Port Credit or go as far as Orchard in Cooksville. Thankfully the missus has started to agree and I don't have to make the drive out anymore!

Service is fast and efficient which is usually great but actually something of a detriment to an indecisive slow riser such as myself. Still, can't really fault them on that count, though I'm not really a fan of the layout which I find a bit crowded and chaotic, especially when I'm trying to wake up.

The menu is pretty basic eggs n' bacon breakfast options, which is pretty much what you'd expect but I'm more of an Eggs Florentine / Huevos Rancheros kinda guy. Maybe this makes me a breakfast snob with a predisposed prejudice against a place like Skyway Jack's but that's just me. Like I said, the price is right, you get a good amount for what you're paying and the quality is just fine...it's just not me!"}
{"text":"went for lunch was very busy...too much signage makes it confusing to order...food was ok but an average greasy spoon kind of place...server wad rude though and the place was ver dirty"}
{"text":"Friendly service and a warm greeting is always present at Skyway Jack's. There is an extremely vast menu that can be overwhelming, I would suggest that you grab 1 of the takeout menus and decide from there. 
They offer a good value for a good portion. I got the double special that was listed at the window, which was 2 eggs, 4 strips bacon, toast and homefries for $6.95. My husband got the French connection, 2 French toast, 2 eggs, 2 bacon and 2 sausage for $10.95. 
The homefries are delicious and everything was cooked well. They offer freshly squeezed orange juice which I would recommend. 
A great place for a decent breakfast at a decent price!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. The home fries weren't really soft. Excellent service and friendly staff. Fresh Orange juice was excellent and coffee too."}
{"text":"Randomly found this greasy spoon through insauga and had the steak special and the steak benedict. Steaks were done to the T and eggs bennys were a dream. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Have been going there for over a decade.  Great service and value for money.  Even on busiest of days the wait for a table and food is not long."}
{"text":"This was terrible. Can't sit without ordering. Price for coffee, turkey bacon, eggs and two pancakes was 19$! More than double where I usually go. Services was plain mean. We asked for water 4 times and on the fourth she screamed back we've already asked enough yet we never got the water! Never ever ever again"}
{"text":"A friendly family greek restaurant serves amazing food with amazing customer service. The best thing is they have freshly squeezed orange juice and freshly blended bean coffee with different taste. 
I have been to this place 4times in couple of months. Certainly would love to come back."}
{"text":"Hungover on a Sunday afternoon? Need a great and cheap breakfast to start your day? That's right, you've come to the right place. 

Here you get your dollars worth for your breakfast. I think I paid about $6 for Jacks breakfast special. 3 eggs scrambled, 2 slices of bacon, 2 sausages and home fries w/ toast. The portions are huge

That breakfast hit the spot, in my tummy that is;) I couldn't even finish it. This food has the guarantee hangover food stamp on it. I'll definitely be back to try their pancakes! On my list!"}
{"text":"This place was overpriced,  the food wasn't good... and they would not accommodate an 11 month old baby who I just wanted to order one egg for.  They said she had to order a kids meal.... so we were forced to order her her own meal which obviously she only had one bite of... this is the first breakfast diner type place I've every been to that doesn't allow you to order a single item like an egg for a set price.  

The bacon was not very good... the potatoes were deep fried,  dry did not enjoy.  I wouldn't complain about this place if it weren't for what we paid for it.  In the end breakfast here cost us 40 dollars!? Two people and a baby who was made to order a kids meal.  They are making a huge profit off of the food here.  The two stars are for the friendly server."}
{"text":"I was here once. It was the last day of English class in high school.  For those who actually showed up to class our teacher rewarded us by leaving class to eat here. I don't remember much otherwise so this was like my first time. 

Aesthetics:  I really like the plethora of menu signs when you enter. I little overwhelming and difficult to choose if you don't know what you want or if there's a wait but you can always just grab a menu to look at. Classic greasy spoon and diner that has the family run feel. 

Food: Ordered their Classic eggs Benny. It wasn't too busy when I went so it came out really quick. Good portion; had the 3 medium poached eggs, potatoes were just crispy enough. The only negative here was probably the sauce. I know most places are making the powdered stuff so I'm finding myself having to rate those. Hollandaise was thicker and richer.  My palette has been leaning towards lighter versions, but that doesn't mean this is bad, just a little too processed and greasy for me. They have 3 more versions of the Benny and wide range of breakfasts and lunch menu items that look very filling. 

Service: As a first timer I didn't know I had to order at the front first so I stood for a moment not knowing what to do and no one said anything to me until I asked if I should sit and an older lady said I order at the cashier first. I don't mind these types of places, especially when I know what I want.  I like not having to wait to pay after. If I'm with a group on a busy morning it could be a negative. 

UPDATE: my dad ordered a chicken Slouvaki dinner. An older lady brought soup to the table and we were all confused. She thought restating '#1' would help but nowhere was that ever listed as a #1 except on the receipt which we hadn't looked. There was never soup listed anywhere with the dinner so that's why we were surprised. She then placed the down soup quite aggressively with a strong expression on her face and walked away. I will never be coming here again."}
{"text":"Been here for both breakfast and burgers. My family loves greasy spoons so when they are in Mississauga they always suggest we go here. Not bad. The cheeseburger definitely wasn't 'homemade' as the menu claimed, but I wasn't expecting anything else from this type of place.
If you want a greasy spoon that doesn't have majorly inflated prices like so many these days, then this is exactly the place you should go.

PS: delicious freshly squeezed orange juice that's not as expensive as most places!"}
{"text":"This is a nice breakfast diner thats close by my place of work.  This place usually packed during lumch hours so make sure you go there early.  I usually roll up here with my co workers theres about 5 to 6 of us and we get seated easily and everybody had found some thing nice on the menu to eat.  The food doesnt take that long to get to the table and the food portions are on par as any all day breakfast joint.  The food here is got that trucker old skool diner feel. I tend to always order burger and poutine or the usual eggs and sausage breakfast with pancakes or french toast.

Given that this close by work i tend to come by once a month since the food here is very hefty takes a long gym work out to get back in shape.  The service ladies are friendly and nice and always lookong forward to come back for nice visit.  Food portions are consistent and they never disappoint keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Food is not good here... greasy and soggy bu the time it gets back if your ordering poutine or sandwiches... basically anything fried or toasted.  Soup is ok... that is it.
Prices also seems high for what you get also."}
{"text":"The best breakfast EVER. My boyfriend, friends, family and I always come here. The service/staff are always warm, welcoming and efficient. Of course it gets busy during peak hours, but we never mind the wait as we know what to expect - great food and greater service."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. Great food, great service and great price. What more could you ask for? Ask for Sophia she introduced me to peameal bacon ...delicious."}
{"text":"I've been to Skyway Jacks a couple of times and every time it is busy! This was a really great first impression - and after my first time, I knew why everyone loves this small joint so much! 

It is now my go-to breakfast place - close by, affordable and delicious. I always get the classic: scrambled eggs, sausage and home fries. I believe this item is around $8.99. 

For me, breakfast places all taste the same to me except here - it stands out because not only is the food really good, the service is super friendly and welcoming. Right when I enter I am greeted with warm smiles and greetings! If you are not a morning person, stopping by here for breakfast just might make your mornings a tad better :P 

Portions are also really good for the price. I can barely finish mine! My boyfriend often orders the omelette and he struggles finishing it & he can typically eat A LOT LOL

Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Such a greasy place to eat breakfast on a weekend. Especially if you are trying to cure a hangover. I love all there breakfast options and they are moderately priced. The portions are huge so you get full. 

Serice is very good and owners are very friendly. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Good brunch place tucked away into a small corner of Mississauga. Upon first walking in to Skyway Jack's, it was a bit confusing. It has a nice diner feel and all, but the menu was all over the place - this made for a good effect, but was confusing when trying to order something lol. After ordering and grabbing a table, your food is served to you - and there are also waiters/waitresses walking around to refill water and coffee.

The food was good and served in generous portions for the price. Between three people, were able to share two plates of food. This especially seems like a good place to go the morning after a night out, or for a good breakfast/brunch on weekends. 

The staff was friendly and attentive. Parking was easy to find since they have (or are part of) an off-street lot. 

There didn't seem to be anything particularly special or new about the food, but I would definitely go back since it was a great experience overall :)"}
{"text":"A hidden gem. Great food. Old school diner feel. Food is always fresh, delicious and greatly priced."}
{"text":"Up here for work from Georgia. Pretty standard breakfast fare. Everyone was very friendly. They kept the coffee coming. The coffee was really good. It's kind of expensive for what it is, in my opinion, but it was good. Everyone enjoyed their meals. Was quick."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Food portions were worth the value. Fast service. What more can I say? Would come again."}
{"text":"Straight up working man's diner.  First time here and I agree that the bombardment of signs and the pre-pay are a curveball. My omelette was very good, not undercooked either. Will return when in the backwaters of the 905."}
{"text":"I searched for organic breakfast and this place came up. there is nothing organic about this food. it's regular greasy food, no Wi-Fi??? What? This is 2017 right? Way over priced for what you get.  12.50 for eggs and bacon. You figure it out."}
