{"text":"Today was my first (attempt) trying this new Thai place. I advised the host it will be 3 of us. He sat me down while I wait for my friends to come. We already knew what wanted, so I was waiting for waiter but he/she never came. 15mins later still no waiter came to my table to even take my drink order at least..my friends came and I told them still nobody took our drink and table behind us I heard them say are they going to take our drink order...so I left and I doubt they even realized I left. I really wanted to try the food. I'm going to give it another chance. I hope I don't want to wait again"}
{"text":"This restaurant is hands down the best in Concord. Great laid back atmosphere, friendly and helpful staff, and the best asian food I've had in a very long time! 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"Tried this for lunch today. The place was very nice. I had the pad Thai with chicken and it was great. Service was good too."}
{"text":"Three things: 1) awesome customer service 2) the food is amazing 3) the decor is so beautiful and calming  I've tried the drunken noodles, pineapple fried rice with tofu, crab rangoon, maple duck, Salisbury roll & I forget the other item. Point is all were very good. Our waitress made sure to check if various seasonings/items were ok (ie curry powder). The entire vibe is relaxing. This is a place for couples, friends, professional happy hour, anniversaries, families, etc. Some tables have couches for seating (they sit a little low). And the plum wine got me straight up twisted a little/lot. The Riesling is good, too. I highly reccomend this spot."}
{"text":"Great food and very fair prices. Nice inside decor and great atmosphere. I've gotten takeout a few times, and I'm looking forward to dining in."}
{"text":"Got takeout here for the for first time today.  Really tasty!  Great lunch specials (menu available online).  Their green curry was fantastic with tofu cooked perfectly.  Sushi was tasty, but very rice heavy.  The decor inside the restaurant was lovely.  Definitely would like to try dining in next time!"}
{"text":"Veggie tempura was really good. I had the chicken fried rice. It had a weird smell but the taste was good."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Unfortunately, no service. Waited 10 mins for someone to seat us. Once seated, we waited 15 mins for a waiter and no one came. The menu looked delicious, unfortunately we could not wait any longer."}
{"text":"Large menu selection of sushi and other Japanese/Chinese food. Sushi was very fresh and prepared quickly. Servers were very attentive. If you are looking for a very good sushi place check this one out."}
{"text":"Beautiful ambience, nice music playing in the background. Wonderful staff and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and it's was fabulous. Every single dish they pulled out was outstanding. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"We love it here!!  The Tom Kha is amazing, as is the sweet and sour and teriyaki chicken.  My husband  usually orders the pad Thai and has always been pleased with it. The decor is tastefully done and the place has a very spacious feel to it.   My husband and I aren't huge sushi fan's but our boys are, and they love the selection here.  The portions are generous and the prices are reasonable.   This is pretty much our \"go to\" place for Thai food."}
{"text":"Great food! The Tom Kha is so delicious! The lunch prices are reasonable and the sushi tastes very fresh. The decor is beautiful... I havent had a chance to dine in yet, but it would be ideal for a romantic date."}
{"text":"Three of us went for dinner. Started with sushi that very tasty.  Tried three different Thai dishes that were all excellent! Will definitely come back!  Very friendly staff"}
{"text":"Beautiful and relaxing atmosphere. Service was excellent from the time we walked in the door until we left. Food was fabulous!!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here and the one in Salisbury. It's alright but has nothing on Wasabi Cafe in Concord. The price of the sushi was way too high for the sushi for multiple people that comes on a boat. Choose your own individual sushi rather than this special. You have no choice of the type of sushi roll nor sashimi. You take what they prepare. This is a nice place inside but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, impressive full bar and menu. Green curry was pretty delicious, different flavor than what I am used but delicious."}
{"text":"Sushi was good (I don't eat it but my boys do), but there is not much else for someone who does not eat fried foods smothered in sauce. I go with my boys and let them eat and them they take me somewhere and let me eat. They like the sushi so I deal with it. Staff is friendly.  I would recommend for sushi on the word of my boys."}
{"text":"Passed by this restaurant many of times and finally decided to give it a try. For a late Sunday afternoon, there was hardly anyone dining inside  when we arrived.  Decor was very nice and detailed.  Greeted by the hostess/owner and was lead to our table.  Ordered an appetizer dish (beef larb, extra spicy), our entrees along with our drinks.    Larb turned out to be NOT spicy at all and wasn't what I expected out of a Thai restaurant.  No hint of lime or spearmint. It's as if they warmed up the meat in the microwave.  Sorry, not impressed.  Our entrees were delivered to our table about almost 15 minutes later.  Not sure what it was but with only 3 parties/groups there including us, that's slow.    Our food was okay, nothing to brag about.  Portions were fine but tasted somewhat bland.  Sauce was so, so.  I understand this place is fairly new and the staff and owner seem like nice folks but that doesn't account for the fact the food isn't that great.    Overall, the food wasn't as good as the decor."}
{"text":"I hate giving negative reviews but it's hard to say anything positive about the experience we just had. I could go into the details but I'll spare you and just say, DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"I was actually on my way to another Thai restaurant in Concord, NC when I came across this brand new spot with a \"Now Open\" banner out front. Well, I still had 10 minutes to go according to GPS so here I stopped. Its a great place...decor was fin and the place is huge.  Menu has a mix of both, Thai and Japanese options.  So, the menu was quite page filled. I went with Thai Fried Rice with Chicken as I was definitely wanting Thai. Spice level 3 was plentiful and quite spicy good. Yum!!  A good Thai stop!!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful lunch here. The interior is beautiful, high ceilings and well decorated with a bar and a sushi bar. The pad thai I had was the best in Concord as they use real tamarind paste on not a tomato paste ( yuck) that some other restaurants use (Quality products and nothing is skimpy.)  My husband had the Garlic and pepper chicken, but he hates broccoli so the chef substituted with snow peas and he loved it. It came with the soup of the day (this day was egg drop) and it was tasty. And it also included a ginger salad that was delicious. Overall we were satisfied and the server was prompt, which allowed us to have a quick lunch before moving on with our day. We will be back, next time to try the sushi."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time with my family today. Fried rice and sushi was excellent! Happy to have a new sushi restaurant closer to home! We will be back."}
{"text":"Waited here for a good 20 mins without even being asked for a drink of water. Very slow service. Waiters were walking around without even noticing customers still waiting. Finally had to get hold of one to ask for water. Probably will never return to this location. Their restaurant in Salisbury is way better."}
{"text":"Went for the first time this past week, and it was honestly one of the most beautiful restaurants I've ever been to. Beautiful interior and decor. The wait staff is very nice and courteous, and the food is amazing and at a very affordable price point. I've been looking for a cheaper Thai restaurant in my area for a while, and I found it. Would definitely recommend, and I will be going back."}
{"text":"Ok so I'm so glad I didn't give up on this place!  I came one time before and got my usual Pad Woon Sen that I always get at Thai restaurants. I wasn't really impressed. The portion was small and I thought nothing really special and even with the crab Rangoon's as an appetizer, which were stale, I left still hungry. The service was slow but I don't think they had been open very long at all.   The next time I came I decided to try things that were completely new to me and I'm so glad I did. I tried an appetizer that said it was like a pork jerky but it was just plain awesome! The sauce it was served with was delicious, and delightful and complimented the meat which crisp with a caramelized coating and was a bit salty. I saw their specialties and tried one of them, the dish with the Ahi tuna. It was outstanding!  The mix of coconut, seasonings, and I think red curry was fresh, and unlike anything I have ever tasted. I was so blown away I came back today three days later.   So this time I asked the lady what she recommended and she suggested a duck dish with four words that I won't try to spell and I could not pronounce even though I tried several times. I really, really, trusted her because I usually hate duck. It is better than the last dish!  The basil, pineapple, and spices took the terrible duck taste completely out. It was crispy on the outside and had wonderful texture and flavor, again like nothing I have ever tasted. Hands down, the best Asian dish I have ever tried in my life! The service was on point the entire meal, and I spent the whole time texting people to come try this place, since I came by myself again. I truly hope this one stays open a long time. DISCLAIMER!!!  This is a real Thai place with people from Thailand, so if you tell them medium spicy you will be chugging whatever beverage you have available and in my case, I started sweating so profusely that it looked like I had a shower running over my head. So if you bring a date, don't get any spice! Just my recommendation anyway . Happy tasting! Oh I forgot to mention the fried cheesecake for desert lol. I have never tried a fried cheesecake but it's just a warm, crispy, battered, bit of excellence with a sweet, creamy, piece of heaven on the inside, drizzled over with extra sweetness if you didn't get enough, and as if it need any help ."}
{"text":"Brand new building, calming beautiful decor and fresh delicious ingredients. The food is amazing. The lady that sat us and took us ur order was very pleasant. Overall it was a very enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"This is a great Thai food place. It's kind of yuppy for k-town but the curry was awesome and the majority of dishes were well priced. The sushi is a little expensive but it's also high quality sushi too. My wife had the pad Thai which she liked and I had the Ahi tuna which I loved. They didn't offer us drinks other then pouring but honestly that didn't bother me as I needed water with my dinner.   If your looking for desert they said they don't have anything other then \"shrimp tempura cheese cake\" I don't know if it's good but if you like sushi it might be worth a try."}
{"text":"Very good sushi. Quiet and relaxing place. Beautiful scenery. Great service with many polite employees. Everything is cooked very well and great spicy food. Best place for family or a date night."}
