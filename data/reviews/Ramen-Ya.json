{"text":"Good location. Cramped but cute interior. Bland yet salty ramen. Toppings were eh (overcooked/bland). Service: only one person looked like they knew what they were doing. Their system of seating and taking orders could be improved upon."}
{"text":"Good ramen. Fatty broth. Thin noodles. Salty. Vegas burrito was weird. Not bad weird but weird. I enjoyed the meal. Service was fast but it wasn't busy on a Thursday afternoon. Seating is limited and not super comfy."}
{"text":"This place is always warm and welcoming. I first judged the place for being too small but the food is great!  I love the fried chicken curry!  It has the perfect amount of ingredients and is very tasteful. Another thing I get is the spicy miso ramen. They're nice enough to substitute the meat. I like the fried chicken instead of the pork and its super good!  Especially when it's colder, it'll warm you up fast"}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant for Japanese fast food. The karaage and onigiri were tasty and much larger than expected. Previous days I bought the miso ramen and a couple of donburi bowls. All dishes were good. Quick and friendly service too!"}
{"text":"Oh it's all GoOoood here!  I am a ramen junkie and I have to say this is some authentic goodness that will not disappoint your taste buds! Not too pricey and in a laid back comfortable setting, come fill your belly here!"}
{"text":"Service was super slow . Had to wait a lot (for a friday). It was  packed. Didnt like the food. Heard ramen is good. Didnt try it yet"}
{"text":"bad?? ??  never come back again! The ramen is cold the soup also is not very hot as well!"}
{"text":"I ordered Karaage and grilled pork ramen at this restaurant. The food was pretty satisfactory, but it was a bit pricey that I'm not sure if I would check out next time."}
{"text":"Great low price ramen right on the strip!  Maybe not the kind of ramen you are expecting, but very tasty and a unique style.  Would recommend to any ramen lover visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"The meat slices in the spicy pork ramen bowl were very tasty as well as the broth in the regular beef and pork ramen.  Service was very quick and friendly.   The strawberry sake was very good."}
{"text":"Was one of my favorite spots to get fast food while take a bit rest. However, not any more. They used only have 1/3 area and a few seats service by yourself. Now it becomes a really full service restaurant and you need to wait be seated. Which means long wait... it's glad to see the restaurant expended, but pity the business mode changed.   Btw, the meat is less than before. Service is good but slow in rush hour, even there are available tables they don't have bandwidth to take care."}
{"text":"Bon, c'est pas le meilleur Ramen que je connaisse."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick bite and didn't want the typical buffet food in the casinos. Came across this restaurant when walking around Grand Bazaar. Ordered a spicy ramen with Miso based soup and it was fantastic. The owner is very friendly and made a new bowl of soup base for my wife as we ordered the wrong one. Would definitely go back again and try other ramen."}
{"text":"The spiciest ramen noodles I've ever had and the fried chicken was so delicious. I definitely recommend this place if you love to eat in nice cozy restaurants"}
{"text":"Delicious hot ramen to soothe the soul.  There are some restaurants where you find a dish you like so much that you order it every time you go.  For me it's the curry broth ramen with breaded cutlet... mmm.  And if I'm extra hungry toss a scallion pancake in the mix.  Delicious.  Come to think of it, my only problem with Ramen-Ya is that I'm not eating it right now."}
{"text":"At first I was kind of shy to try this place. It's kind of hidden and not a lot of traffic. But wow! Very delicious.  I got the mild spicy miso flavor ramen. I got it without meat. It was Delicious. Not too spicy. The smell of the ingredients in the soup was so homie. Def give this place a try if I could give them 10 stars I would. The service was amazing. Will be coming back here when ever I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great place if you are looking for a snack to share or meal on the strip. \"Cheap\" by strip standard food and comparable to other ramen restaurants on Spring Mountain. Had the spicy miso and it had a kick! Totally agree with Kat L...about the negative reviews..."}
{"text":"Soup tastes great, noodles good quality, the karaage is tender and tasty. I gave it 4 stars because it's hard to find a seat."}
{"text":"Ramen-Ya is perhaps best described as a very friendly Ramen shop that needs a bit more work on the food-end to get the product to live up to the price tag.  This isn't Vancouver, folks. Montreal Japanese cuisine is expensive, and here is no different than any other authentic place I can think of. But to their credit, the family operating the place is very fluent (en francais or English) and eager to help you figure out what any given on the menu may be. They have a fairly comprehensive assortment of dishes (yakisoba, udon, gyoza, sushi) but most will go for the named Ramen. It's not surprising; one step in and the atmosphere alone will have you convinced the place means business.  The ramen is what I'd call...unusual? My pork Shoyu bowl had a noticeable taste of seafood for some reason - not a great idea - but the pork cutlet was neatly fried and sliced to the side, which really helped with the flavor. (There is a reasonably priced trio set (~$20) with gyoza and beer which I'd recommend to anyone looking for a traditional Ramen set experience.) Other dishes we experienced had similar ups and downs. The gyoza was excellent, but small for the money.  It's not in-and-out neighborhood ramen, and I don't think I would choose it over Kazu anytime soon, but it's a fine choice for Japanese eating in the area. I'd definitely consider it again if I couldn't decide what to eat."}
{"text":"Le Ramen végétarien manque de goût, les légumes congelés sont cuits dans de l'eau ?! Ou un bouillon sans goût.  Les autres plats étaient correct."}
{"text":"Truly the worst service I've received out of my countless restaurant visits.  Our table was very sticky and seemed like it hadn't been cleaned in ages. Also it was never set even after 10 minutes we had been there. A server came only after we asked around the 15 minute mark. The entire staff was idling (one was in the corner staring into her phone) to add to the ghost-town-esque atmosphere caused by the obvious lack of customers in the shop. The server was rather rude, seemed to be annoyed and had no intention of serving us with the least amount of courtesy. The food was mediocre and was nothing spectacular for the money. To top it all off, they had the audacity to ask for a tip. When we refused, they refused to give us change. The tip should be earned, not mandatory, but these rude servers just could not understand!  I couldn't emphasize better how horrid our experience was.  Please avoid this restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried the kara age (fried chicken) , um not good  Only thing decent here is the ramen, I mean the texture of the noodles, the broth is a bit too salty.  The grilled chicken is quite good, the meat is fresh and it is well grilled.  The teriyaki udon was a bit too sweet...  I didn't feel it..."}
{"text":"This place holds a shame by calling themselves a \"Ramen restaurant\". I could clearly tell their TONKOTSU ramen is package ramen by Sapporo Ichiban (https://www.amazon.com/Sapporo-Ichiban-Tonkotsu-Instant-18-5oz/dp/B00HY2VBZ0) I buy it and eat it at home often so I could instantly tell. The flavor was horrendous. Really tasteless and boring, I'd certainly never go back nor recommend anyone to go."}
{"text":"Seriously the best meal we've had in Vegas! We found a little gem stone in a very busy area. Service was great and we will most definitely go back."}
{"text":"Sad. I stopped in here because I'm always up for a good bowl of ramen and this place billed itself as \"the best ramen in Las Vegas.\"  Nowhere close to that.   The Shoyu soup stock is beyond ordinary. Tastes like Swanson chicken broth with soy sauce added to it. The broth is probably better suited for udon noodles but for a Shoyu ramen, this is not it.   The noodles were decent, though I like my noodles a little thicker. But at least these noodles are fresh, they don't seem to use prepackaged stuff.  The chashu that's in there is not very tender. A bit on the thin side as well.   The ramen comes in a big plastic cup. It's like Cup o' Ramen. It's actually a cute idea. You can walk around with ramen in your hand.   When I'm in Vegas, after a couple of nights of eating decadent heavy meals, a nice bowl of soup always hits the spot. Except this time."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal.  The best Japanese restaurant for entrees and ramen in Las Vegas hands down.  Authentic flavors the way they should be.  You can feed a family here for the price of one person at a fancy Japanese place and still taste better."}
{"text":"Had lunch there on a weekday and I have to say that the ramen and service was excellent!  This will be my to go place when ever I am on the strip and in the mood for some ramen and karaage .  Also the curry and rice is prepared just like it was when I was in Japan.      We went back for a late night drink and some appetizers .  Like always the service, beer and food is always excellent.  I got a chance to take a picture with the manager \"Koji San\" former Pro Sumo Wrestler.  Really nice man!  We love it here at Ramen Ya Katana!"}
{"text":"if you're looking for ramen with prepackaged vegetables like you get at a dollar store and cold flavorless way over cooked gray eggs, then this is the place for you. just wish they took the extra steps in making sure their soups were made properly and not carelessly. great location very sad that it was wasted by this ramen shop"}
{"text":"Really disappointed in the service. We sat down and we were handed the menus. Then nothing happened for the next 10 minutes. No water to the table. No other interaction with the waitress. And then we realized that three other tables that had come in after us were getting their order taken before us, as well as getting water, etc. And when I tried to make eye contact and waive someone down I was ignored. The other server was having some serious trouble with the payment system too. Probably waited a full 15-20 minutes total. We walked out. Just the worst experience I've had on the Strip."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place.  I did.  And I thought it could be a magic source of tasty ramen tucked away in crappy overpriced Vegas food.  It had the cramped no frills interior that I thought might translate into authentic ramen.  But it wasn't good.  I eat at the crappy ramen places so you don't have to--skip this one.  Noodles were sub par.  Broth was weak.  Egg was way over cooked.  Sorry, still looking for good ramen in Vegas.  Stay tuned."}
{"text":"This has become one of my go-to ramen take out places, and I have never been disappointed.  Sometimes I call ahead, and sometimes I just stop by, but it has never taken me longer than 10 minutes to have ramen in my hands. (Well not literally in my hands. You know. Take-away style in a take-away bag.) Service is fast and efficient, and people are nice -- on cold days when I am waiting for my order, the staff bring over green tea while I wait, which is just so pleasant. I usually get the house broth, which I think is super tasty and flavorful, or the spicy beef ramen, which could be spicier in my opinion but which still hits the spot.  Thank you, Ramen-Ya for tending to my cold-weather ramen-y needs."}
{"text":"So I'd been here before and had a great experience.   Unfortunately this time around, not so great. When you first walk in you'll see a register and sit down portion of the restaurant. We were told we could just sit down and order. Our server then came up to us before our food had come, told us our total, and asked if we were ready to pay before our food has even come. Like what? Other tables by us were able to order and didn't have to pay until they'd actually received their food. When we did go up to the cashier to pay they didn't even understand their payment system. We were each charged individually and then told we had a remainder left to pay and that it was tax? Our receipts have the tax printed on it?? Thankfully someone other than our server was able to explain that it was an error and that they'd waived the remainder.   Food aside, it was a disappointing customer service experience and I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"A la recherche d'un bon restaurant de Ramen à nous avons choisi celui là ... Mauvais choix,  les 2 soupes choisies étaient juste correctes, sans arôme sans punch. Les morceaux de porc dans les soupes étaient des morceaux bacon gras et sans goût. Le restaurant semble plus être conçu pour recevoir les grands groupes sur le party et pas trop regardant sur la qualité des plats . Pour 2 soupes, 4 raviolis, 2 bières : 55$ facture plutôt salée Dommage on ira ailleurs la prochaine fois ."}
{"text":"I went there twice. I had the Yokozuma with miso. I love it and would go back for the ramen. Nice flavorful broth.  The chicken and dumplings were also good. I order it to go cuz the place is kind of small and the Packaging and containers were great for To go. I also tried the tokyo burrito. It was ok a little hard to eat. Would definitely recommend the ramen though."}
{"text":"Is this really the same as the downtown SF recipe?  I taste no flavor other than saltiness!"}
{"text":"tbh even i make better ramen than this.  the ramen soup should always be pork based, not chicken. the noodle is clumpy and hard. the egg is hard boiled, the yolk isnt even runny.  what surprises me is theyre japanese too but.. shittiest ramen i have ever had in my entire life."}
{"text":"The two stars were given to the noodle chef.  \"0\" to the broth which is the most important part of Raman.  There is way too much salt in the soup and it is impossible to drink it at all.  Raise the price if you have to, but don't cut the corners."}
{"text":"The concept of Ramen is very simple and quite delightful. You get \"there\", order your Ramen, and eat your Ramen. In Japan, the concept is cool because usually you order and pay through a machine (like an ATM) and everything is done rapidly and orderly.   Thus, my surprise at the complete lack of service of Ramen-Ya. Ordering a Ramen soup took nearly 20 minutes.   The Noodle is the key to a good Ramen soup, Broth being the second ingredient. I would've expected something quite good coming out of Ramen-Ya but unfortunately the noodles were plain and tasteless. Poor texture, no spring to them and difficult to noisily suck \"in\".   The Broth was good however, a mix of miso and chicken fond. Enough taste to finish and not too salty to require additional water.   The fillings (porc slabs and vegies) were poor in taste and quantity, making the overall Ramen experience a  big mEh. At least the egg wasn't overcooked.   Took the better part of an hour to eat a simple Ramen. After which, being still hungry, we asked for the menu, but were unable to re-order ( we got forgotten i suppose...). So we forgot to tip in return.   Sad to see this place so busy with the hispter vibe of the plateau, but fail at the simpliest of task. They seemed very busy with their takeout orders tho..."}
{"text":"This place has great portion sizes for the price. Spicy tonkotsu was delicious. Broth was light, noodles were great constancy. The chasu was tender. Definitely coming back on my next trip."}
{"text":"I eat lunch here often, being that it's located close to my work. The service is always fast and efficient and the food is always delicious. I usually have gyoza and ramen, and I've never been disappointed (the spicy beef is my favorite). Anyone I've brought with me here has been happy to learn about it's existence. I'd say it is at least on par, if not better than some of the better ramen's I've eaten."}
{"text":"This was such a weird but wonderful find amidst all the craziness of the Las Vegas strip. I had the spicy miso ramen (which I was told was the most popular) and it was so delicious I ate the entire giant bowl...and then ordered and ate the exact same thing the next day! Just the right combination of spicy and savory, fantastic dumplings and tender pork in addition to the noodles. And amidst all the super expensive food this is a great bargain."}
{"text":"Best ramen and great prices ....chicken karaage? was yumm too and @ $4 each you are going to wanna get at least x2. Did I mention ice cold Saporro cans?"}
{"text":"Mediocre ramen, I would recommend momofuku if you want more authentic style and deeper flavors.   I got the tonkatsu style. The egg was over cooked, the noodles doesn't stick to anything and taste more like instant ramen.   Although the food was bad, the employees were nice."}
{"text":"I was on the strip for the night and needed a place to stay which would be delicious (but not bankrupt me).  Turned to my old faithful (i.e. Yelp) for a restaurant near me and Rame Ya Katana was one of them.  The directions were not the best but it's located in the Grand Bazaar in front of Ballys.  All the choices looked great and I ended up choosing the Spicy Miso Ramen soup.  It was amazing!!!  A little bit of a slow burn but not overwhelming.  I can't name all the ingredients but everything was delicious with different textures and a little bonus with an egg.  Delicious and I'll be back the next time I'm in town to try all the other ones."}
{"text":"I'm allergic to high levels of msg so all the ramen I've ever had has been restaurant-bought. I don't know if I was just really hungry or if this ramen was ridiculously good.   I got a custom ramen with grilled chicken, veggies, egg, and miso. It was absolutely delicious. I had it to go and the soup was still burning hot when I got home.   I'm super tired so this review isn't gonna be my best one but long story short: this place has great ramen!"}
{"text":"\" Pour passer un moment dans une ambiance de restaurant japonais relativement authentique, cet endroit convient parfaitement. Mais il faut y mettre le prix. \" Le décors ressemble effectivement aux petits pubs japonais de style \" Izakaya \", et les plats ont la saveur qui les élève au dessus de la restauration rapide (oubliez le Yoshinoya). Notre serveuse parlait un français de France irréprochable, mais le service conservait sa touche des manières asiatiques (mais dans un cadre informel). Les nouilles avaient un goût de pâtes fraîches et le bouillon des soupes avait bon goût.   La foule était composée de jupes et veston tout autant que de jeunes couples \" relaxes \" de ce coin hip de Montréal, venus passer un bon moment dans une ambiance feutrée, appuyée de décorations d'armatures de bois, chaises hautes et service au comptoir, de banderoles colorées et de lanternes tout-à-fait similaires à celles que l'ont retrouve en Orient.   La carte comporte en outre une petite sélection d'alcools de marque japonaise.   Les bémols que nous voyons : le menu nous apparaissait parfois un peu incompréhensible (quoique munis de photos très utiles), et le prix un peu élevé. Mais l'expérience en valait globalement la dépense. Le stationnement dans ce coin de la ville est aussi un peu plus difficile à trouver pour ceux qui se déplacent sur roues, mais c'est un coin qu'il fait bon parcourir à pied. Le plus proche Métro est Mont-Royal."}
{"text":"Good ramen and rice bowl. You order up front. Find a seat around the corner and someone will bring you the food. Seating is limited as it's a small joint. Will be back again ."}
{"text":"I wouldn't call this ramen. U won't see me here again! I couldn't believe ramen in the plastic cup!?"}
{"text":"So it's a Friday, and we're a group of colleagues. You know the deal,  large group, high spirits, cause, hey, it's a Friday.  There doesn't seem to be a table large enough to accommodate the size of our group, and we're just trying to figure out how to split ourselves up, when the waiter pounces on some guy who's eating and MOVES him. Ok, that works our for us, but I've never seen a patron pushed off his table mid-meal before in my life. This should have been my first clue.  So we sit, and 10 minutes or so later, the waiter takes our order. Ask him a few questions, almost all of which are answered in a mumble that sounds like \"yes, it's noodles\". Same answer to all questions. Well, we're all tech geeks, so a quick search on our phones manages to DE-mystify most of the menu. Second clue as to the service.  40 minutes later, and 1 salad and 2 soups have appeared so far. There's a bit of hunger going on by now. One of my colleagues is eying the remnants of one of the salads, so we push it over to him.   50 minutes in, and HALF of the table is served. Umm, ok.  The remaining 4 of us are patient, and figure we're next.  My colleague is now fiddling with the paper wrapper from the chopsticks and I'm afraid he's going to eat it.  60 minutes in, still no food for the remaining 4, and in the meantime we've watched 3 other tables get served.  70 minutes in, I go remind the server that half of our table is missing food. \"Yeah? It's busy.\"  75 minutes in, and finally the remaining 4 dishes appear. And my salmon teriyaki is RAW.  STONE COLD RAW.  'nuff said. Never again."}
{"text":"It's authentic Japanese ramen. But caution: felt terribly thirsty after this meal. Also you would get at least 10 times better service without tips and with about half price and double portion in Japan (even in Japan portion of noodle is not that small). Understand about the price and the portion probably due to cost in America, but a little bit disappointed that they don't keep as warm and good service as in Japan, which I believe Japanese is proud of. But thanks to this meal, *homesick* of Japan has been cured."}
{"text":"Ramen noodle was cooked well- al dente. I had the spicy ramen from the first page of the menu. Pretty good but it's not the best ramen broth I've ever had in my life."}
{"text":"First time here.  I'm not a huge fan of ramen but this place hit the money spot. If you're drunk and craving some yummy ramen,  hit this place up.  Small intimate restaurant but delivers on the food."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic!  A hole the wall but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"If you want Ramen don't come here. Its fast food bad quality food plus it was all broth and noddles, barely 2 small slices of meat and half broiled egg inside a huge bowl. HORRIBLE!!"}
{"text":"Found this little ramen place while strolling through Ballys. I did some research and found out it's brand new and based from a Popular ramen place in San Francisco. My fiancé and I ordered the spicy miso ramen and it did not disappoint! Broth was rich and flavorful and the chasu pork was tender. we are so glad we found a great ramen place right on the strip. They serve sushi and curry plates too. Definitely coming back here on our next visit!!!!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? I will start when I saw a sign that read \"Rated best ramen on LV strip\". When I went there I had to wait for a table for a few minutes. Once I was sat I waited several more minutes and the wifey had to flag one of the workers down to take my order. After my food was ordered it came out fairly fast. I hate to admit I paid $2.50 for a 12 ounce can of Pepsi and another 15 for the ramen. The ramen was good but it just wasn't enough. Before I could finish my bowl of ramen one of the workers who ignored me initially came up and asked if I was ready to pay. It would have been nice for him to be \"Johnny on the spot\" to take my order. I finished my bowl of ramen and I was still hungry. I walked back to my hotel and bought some hotdog on a stick. I don't believe I should pay 15 bucks for a bowl of ramen and leave still hungry. High prices, unreasonable amount of food plus poor service will lead to just one star. I will continue my hunt for a better ramen place. Stay away! I don't know who rated this place as the best but more of a bust."}
{"text":"Pretty good place to enjoy ramen, we didn't wait that much to get our food,the taste of the ramen it's pretty good. Will try it again."}
{"text":"I got spicy miso ramen, and I didn't like it so much. For one, the ramen noodle is harder than normal, meaning they probably precooked a batch of noodle, set it to the side, and once they got an order, they put the noodle into the soup. Or they don't know how to make ramen noodles. The soup is mediocre. I did taste my fiancé's tonkatsu soup and that's pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is a good 4 stars for location and quality of broth. At least for the shoyu version.  I found the miso one to be too salty. There is just a stand up area to eat but you can take out. I'd suggest this place for a quick bite to eat but I actually liked it. Hey have their sushi burritos as well as rice bowls so that should cover your taste buds if you want something else. Try it once. Another ramen shop to add to the list. I'd say prices are affordable for places serving ramen. If you want instant well then do no look here."}
{"text":"I went here a couple of months ago while on my quest for the best ramen in town. I was dissapointed. Broth was salty, and taste-wise, I've seen better. The fried bananas were also disappointing, very pasty and didn't highlight the fruit. The only good thing I would say I enjoyed was their takoyaki.  As for the service, it was slow, and we never received the second batch of takoyaki my brother ordered. Overall, the food isn't great, weak service and blunt atmosphere."}
{"text":"Located in the shopping mall in front of Bally's, it's down the same row as Starbucks.  Very informal, there's a line up to order and a very small, limited seating area.  The staff actually won't prepare your order until there is seating.  Fortunately, turnover is pretty quick since you probably wouldn't want to linger.  As for the ramen, noodles weren't overcooked and were nicely chewy, and the broth was tasty.    They've also got donburi bowls and sushi rolls, and some other little appetizer plates.  Good food and friendly servers.  I'd definitely recommend for a quick, convenient bite to eat."}
{"text":"Found this inexpensive ramen restaurant so close to the strip.  I ordered a combo karaage / Gyoza / chasyu / 2 eggs tonkostu ramen for $14 plus tax.  It was very good and service was ok.  You have to prepay before they deliver the food."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick bowl of ramen on the way back to our hotel.  We order shoyu and miso ramen.  They do not serve the traditional Japanese ramen noodles and the shoyu and miso broths were very different from what I'm accustom to.   I do enjoy a GREAT bowl  of ramen being from Vancouver, BC where ramen is the 'thing'.  In fact, I travelled to Japan last summer seek out the best ramen.    Back to my review, the noodles and soup combinations were acceptable and very tasty but not authentic Japanese ramen.  In fact the egg noodles used has the same taste and texture as Chinese egg noodles used in wonton soup.  I found the miso broth a bit on the salty side.  The staff is extremely friendly and attentive.  Please do keep in mind, my review is objectively based on my palate and food experiences."}
{"text":"Having a teriyaki bowl they're pretty good the owner is awesome and they give great service good for a quick bite"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. I was greeted with a smile. The ramen noodles was served hot and spicy. The rice curry was good but not as spicy as I would have expected since it was \"curry.\" The prices are more expensive than usual because it is located on The Strip by Bally's and Starbucks. But give it a try. They open as early as 9:30am. Thank you for the good service!"}
{"text":"Fell in love when it was just a tiny little space, and now even more in love with it offering sitting area. The ramen is delicious but the broth is something else. Always such friendly service! Anytime I'm in Vegas, I make certain to eat here a couple times and the prices make it even better."}
{"text":"Okay little ramen place by Ballys. My dad ordered Beef Miso Ramen with medium spice..it was mediocre. Not much flavor to the broth.. My mom ordered the Beef donburi...DELICIOUS!!! My favorite entree actually, full of flavor and the beef to rice ratio was perfect. My husbands mom is full Japanese and makes homemade beef donburi (amazing by the way) and Ramen Ya version definitely comes close to it! Chicken teriyaki... was too dry for my liking.. /: but I'd give this place another try!   Btw, matcha green tea with boba is a must try!"}
{"text":"Went here because I was craving some ramen after my last trip to Japan. The decor is really nice and reminiscent of a Japanese restaurant. The menus were very extensive and the service was friendly. I ordered a typical miso based ramen and my friends ordered a beef donburi plate and spicy beef ramen. All in all it was satisfactory however the noodles in the ramen were not fresh and springy as I was expecting. The donburi was really good and I actually preferred it to my ramen which is unusual considering I prefer ramen over anything...So a bit of a bummer. All in all it was okay but overpriced."}
{"text":"I really have to change the light on this spot.  In terms of vegas pricing, this spot is very affordable. Ramen puts you out about $8-$9, versus the $17 other nearby asian joints selling ramen!  Please negate a previous reviewer commenting about the plastic cup. Any of these shops on the Grand Bazaar are going to be inclined towards a tourist, or someone else quickly passing through.  It makes no sense to serve ramen in a big ceramic bowl. Why use reusables, and bother with re-cleaning, when most people come in for a pit-stop and continue on? Silverware is more ideal if it offered full dinner service, and someone truly meant to sit and dine for an hour. I don't even think half the shops are connected to a water line, or have a sink.  There IS an eating area, but offers very little seating (only well suited for 2's or 4). But come on. You wouldn't come here for dinner. Or with a group.  It's a healthier, Asian, on-the-go.   But the food was pretty good! It's flavorful. It hit the spot. Well balanced. Noodles cooked well. The pork was cooked well. I also got seaweed salad, which was good, and a melon soda. Altogether my meal was about $18.  Next time I'm in vegas, I'd definitely hit this place up again if I'm staying at Paris or Bally's. Ideal for lunch or a quick bite. The sushi looked pretty good, too. And that was priced about $6 a roll; also pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"Food + price + service + location make this one an easy sell. We had the rice dishes. The only thibg lacking is the food could have been more spicy."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday morning right as they opened. I was greeted by a friendly cashier who took my order and yelled behind her what to prepare. Its a VERY small establishment, with only a couple of bar tables in a small side area if you want to eat there.   4 stars is for the fact that my spicy ramen was delicious, and what you would expect from a vendor in a shopping mall for a decent price. Keep in mind, I don't eat a whole lot of ramen and am probably easily pleased so if you are a ramen connoisseur take my review with a grain of salt. I thought the noodles were perfectly cooked and I watched them add the fresh ingredients at the end (little soggy by the time i got up to my room, but still delicious). Yes its served in a plastic container so you can take it with you, but they did offer me a bowl if I wanted to dine-in.   Overall I was pleased and will return during my next adventure in Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent ramen !  The Karaage was honestly my favorite part of the shoyu ramen and I'm disappointed we don't have this level of delicious ramen where I live.  Definitely affordable, kind of hidden, and a little cramped inside.  The food makes it well worth it though!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of those little gems that takes you by surprise!  It's located down an alley like area infront of the Paris.  At first sight, there is really nothing special about it except the lanterns outside.  There was also nothing too spectacular about the inside, it looked like a small restaurant with very limited seating.  It was decorated inside with Japanese lanterns, art, and small tables.  The server/hostess was very nice and took us directly to a table in the back, which was a little more private, although tight.  She took our order for drinks and within a couple minutes was back, ready to take our order.  We asked a couple questions and she made some ramen suggestions.  It wasn't long at all and we were enjoying our ramen.  The ramen was absolutely delicious!  There was a depth and richness to the broth that makes you want to keep eating non-stop, which I did.  We got the Spicy and normal Tonkotsu ramen, both pork.  I have to admit, we were pleasantly surprised and very impressed!  We didn't expect the ramen to be that good, BRAVO!  This is one of those little gems that will not leave you hungry or broke!  We definitely recommend it to ramen lovers everywhere."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Las Vegas and was looking for a good ramen joint. Looked up a few places and came across this one. Great choice! I ordered the tonkatsu broth and my husband had the spicy tonkatsu. Both were worth a try! The service was on point and they all come by one after another to check up on you. That's always a bonus!"}
{"text":"Quality has really dropped. Dumplings came out of the microwave, veal short ribs were greasy, and the spicy beef ramen had dry, instant noodles and dry, flavorless beef. Broth was boring.   Waiters seem indifferent.   Sad, used to be a good place."}
{"text":"I didn't find this place really great or impressive as it claims to be. Service is mediocre and inconsistent. They never even served me water for the entire time I was sitting, waiting and eating, but they did it right away to the next customer coming in.  Ramen is better than average. At least they get it right, but the quantity isn't worth the price. Perhaps, it was due to their location."}
{"text":"Great find in the heart of the madness!  We loved this quaint spot. The food is fantastic and the service was speedy and friendly. Very well priced menu considering they are located in the heart of the strip. Very small eat in section and you will probably have to wait a few minutes for a spot. Well worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"Leaving one star because I came about 30 minutes prior to closing and there was already a closed sign up. I traveled all the way to the Strip specifically for this ramen just to be disappointed. Maybe I 'll update my review when I can actually try the ramen."}
{"text":"I was visiting Montreal from Little Rock and felt like I had to take advantage of the big city to catch some japanese ramen and okonomiyaki. Sure enough, I found this place and decided to give it a try. The service wasn't great, the guy who waited my table, who appeared to be the manager if not the owner, didn't really look too enthused to have us there. Having said that, the food was good. The broth was a bit greasy yet it still did the trick. Their okonomiyaki is a bit unorthodox in that they use panko to make the texture more crispy. After eating poutine for the first 3 days in Montreal, it was a good switch."}
{"text":"Ramen-ya has always been the kind of spot I'm happy to have in my neighbourhood. Reasonably priced, delicious food, in a cosy setting. But lately on my walks up the street I've noticed Ramen-Ya has expanded into the space next door, transforming from cosy hole in the wall to full blown restaurant. I dropped in for a late lunch and got to check out the new space and was quite impressed. The service was very quick, but I wonder how the kitchen can handle a huge room full of people? I guess I'll have to come back to check it out.   On this visit I had a spicy beef ramen and it was absolutely delicious. I feel like they've stepped up their game since my last visit some time ago.  Not sure exactly what was different, but it tasted even better than it usually does."}
{"text":"When you're craving delicious ramen in a nice comfortable environment, this is the place to go. The shoyu ramen with fried pork is my all time favourite. Everything is prepared fresh to order. They also have a dumpling + ramen + beer special for $21, definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is beyond horrible. My family and I wanted something Asian on the strip and found this through yelp. Don't let the stars fool you. If you want high cholesterol, come on in. The ramen is so damn salty just like how I am for spending $60 at this salty establishment. They serve ramen and sushi burritos. We ordered three burritos and they all came out sushi style. Sliced up in about 9 pieces.  It's not a big deal but we ordered that because we were expecting a burrito not 9 pieces.  We told them and the first thing they said was \"oh we sometimes serve it in half and sometimes in 9 pieces.\"   UHHHHH? why the hell are you advertising it as a burrito and then saying its sometime serves as a burrito or a sushi pieces. Who on earth decided that? Wasn't I the one who paid for the food that was advertise?  There is another yelp page under ramen ya with like 1-2 stars. That should be the correct help yelp because this place suck!!   SAVE YOUR MONEY"}
{"text":"I read the reviews before I tried this place. Honestly we we're pleasantly surprised  The soup and karaage was not overly salty as many reviews had stated. Prices were very reasonable considering prices in Vegas. Also the karaage was pretty good. I gave it 4 stars because I think overall it's pretty good considering where this is. Vegas strip is.not where you.go to eat great ramen, you can't find anything  this good on the strip and.not for $9.95.  Also some reviewers complained that the.karaage was not crispy, ask for it on the side, it's a simple fix   We found the batter just.rigtand the taste.very good and not overly salty. Could be we were there on a good day but it was definitely worth 4 stars and hit the spot as it was what we were craving. So give.them a try and keep in mind that it's not going to be like eating ramen on any major metropolitan area but it tastes so.good when you are tired of Vegas food!"}
{"text":"Amazing ramen place. Loved the spicy ramen and the fried chicken thigh appetizer. Very satisfying. Quite inexpensive too."}
{"text":"Solid Ramen escpically for Vegas. Great hangover food and kinda werid location in a temp strip mall in front of Bally's casino..you would miss it if you look hard for it."}
{"text":"Excellent endroit sans prétention pour manger des soupes Ramen. Ne vous méprenez-pas ! On ne vous sert pas un sachet de poudre et des nouilles sans goût (hehe), mais de vraies soupes japonaises de type Ramen. Vous choisissez le bouillon (Miso, Épicé, Curry, Special) et la viande. Le tout est assez copieux et difficile à finir, mais vous pouvez emporter vos restants. Le combo Gyoza + Bière Sapporo + Soupe revient à une vingtaine de dollars et vous en avez suffisament pour votre argent.   A essayer !"}
{"text":"The menu was small and the prices were a lot higher than expected when compared to other places along The Strip. The food was good but I've had it more less at other places. And the location was extremely small and limited in size."}
{"text":"If you're addicted to real ramen, this place will do for a fix. But that's about it.   Rating Scale: 1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.   2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one? 3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch. 4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible. 5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here because we were too hungry to wait an hour at Walburgers. The service was quick and the staff are really nice. The ramen was pretty good. The broth was flavorful and I had mine with the fried chicken which was nicely seasoned and added a good taste to the overall dish. The size of the bowl is ok for the price but this is Vegas so we expected to pay more then if we were off the strip."}
{"text":"We were looking for a spot to grab a quick bite before going to a dayclub, and came across Ramen Ya Katana while walking through the Grand Bazaar. Ramen didn't sound like the best option for a sweaty day in Vegas, but it turns out they have sushi burritos!   There are not many places to sit down if you wanted to dine in. The restaurant is narrow and they fit in two counters to sit at and some small tables. Of course, you can always take your order to go, but I don't know how well that would go over with ramen.   I went for the SAPPORO ($9.77), which contains salmon, shrimp tempura, imitation crab, avocado, and lettuce. It came out pretty quickly, in what felt like 10 minutes or less. However, we were all surprised when the sushi burrito came out wrapped in a tortilla instead of nori. I've never seen a sushi burrito made like this, and while the tortilla was thin and didn't take away too much from the sushi, I wish I would have known. I asked later if you can sub nori instead of the tortilla and they said you could (but the option is not made known while ordering!). Overall it tasted alright, but nothing special. I was definitely very full after, and the price is good for the portion given.  I think this is a good choice for some economical Japanese eats while on The Strip, but it's nothing special. There are signs inside that say it got a Michelin recommendation, and I'd really like to know the backstory behind that.  Food: 3.5, Service: 4, Environment: 2, Price: 4"}
{"text":"The noodles are not good. I liked my miso soup broth, but do not like the texture of my noodles at all. I couldn't eat it because it felt similar to uncooked noodles."}
{"text":"I ordered their house ramen. Not impressed. The soup tastes like the broth of the beef noodle joint in Chinatown. The ramen texture reminds me of instant noodle . Also the portion is more like appetizer than a meal. Trying this place once is good enough."}
{"text":"Fantastic beef donburi.  Tasted exactly like beef bowl from Japan.  Definitely more expensive than beef bowl in Japan (around $6 us equivalent in Japan.  $12 here), but an amazing price for Vegas!  Great service, friendly waiters.  They seemed surprised by our use of Japanese in return to their basic greetings and thank you's.  If I could convince my group to eat here every day for this trip, I would."}
{"text":"?????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Good but not great.   Pros: Dining atmosphere is wonderful. Small spot that truly feels like a ramen shop.   Sake: The Mango selection was delicious  Broth: Flavorful, delicious and a good amount of spice  Cons: The Chasu pork could be a lot more tender  Noodles were on the tougher, chewy side.  Boiled egg really needs to be a soft-boiled egg."}
{"text":"So why does this place charge you 16% for being seated and served at a normal table in a normal restaurant?... And why do they not tell you this until you get the bill?   Pros: - Ramen is okay, but atleast it comes out very fast here. - Seaweed salad is good - Traditional Japanese greeting and good bye sayings - Nice staff   Cons: - Did you read the first sentence? - No bathrooms - Very small space - Location a bit hard to find - Price is not worth it - Told us we were being seated in the back, \"to protect pretty ladies\"... say what"}
{"text":"Delicious and thoroughly enjoyed. No sushi. Highly recommended. Looks like run by Japanese."}
{"text":"Excellent. Really surprised that ramen noodles could be this good. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"bad service ever. bad taste of box beef?it is overcooked and tastes bitter. the first time i dont wanna give the tips at all"}
{"text":"Ramen-Ya serves a great spicy ramen miso! I usually get it with extra pork for an extra yummy experience! It's a small and quiet place that is a change from the usual saint Laurent hustle and bustle.  Because of this intimate atmosphere it is great for a date! Charm your sweetheart with a warm bowl of ramen. I'm serious, this place is great for a date. The comfort food helps! GO GO if you near by!  For an added treat I like to treat myself to fried mochi with ice cream. Hello heaven!"}
{"text":"I'm rating one star again just hoping to give this restaurant a fair rate. When we got there there was a big family of 11 people eating and taking up all tables, which was fine cuz they were actually leaving in mins but the woman I mentioned told us there was no table for us unless we took it Togo. I was confused thinking somebody else had made reservation but the fact was NO. The family left before we placed our orders. Bedsides that bixth rolled her eyes at us when we told her we were five of us. Super disappointed and unhappy with this meal...feel very bad when I recall the woman's face.."}
{"text":"We were surprised to find a Ramen shop on the strip while walking through the Grand Bazaar shops outside Bally's. Normally if you order ramen from a casino on the strip expect to fork over 2x the average amount.  I could have sworn Monte Carlo has a place selling Monster Ramen for $40!  Either that or commute to the local Chinatown and look for authentic flavors.  The shop is really tiny - a few counters with stools in the back.  We wanted a light snack so we ordered and shared the following:  Chicken Karaage - basically fried chicken, Japanese style.  Four pieces for $4 - good crispiness, good juicy and tender meat, and decent seasoning.    Miso Spicy Ramen - For $9, its not too bad - chicken-based broth was spicy in a good way, and the few pieces of sliced pork were juicy.  They added quite a bit of kakiage, which is like tempura versions of thinly sliced onions.  Noodles were chewy.  Would be a good place for a quick and cheap snack, and good if you're really craving ramen.  Its pretty tiny with limited seating, but folks eat quickly and leave.  Sort of like In-and-Out Ramen!"}
{"text":"I had the spicy miso noodles and extra noodles. I paid 17$ including a 15% tip. A drink was not included... now was it worth it?   They were delicious!! The chicken had a nice crunch to it. The egg was beautiful.... the broth so hot and not too spicy!!! I honestly believe that one bowl with extra noodles is enough to feed 2 people.   I literally waited 5 min for a take out order. Very friendly and super attentive !"}
{"text":"Honestly, we stumbled upon this place and we absolutely love it. A bit of salt in the broth and it would be even better. Everything was really good. Sodas served in cans. Really small. Very straight forward menu."}
{"text":"Better than expected Ramen in Las Vegas. Service was good, prices quite reasonable, and the quality was good."}
{"text":"Spotted this place during a rare walk along St-Laurent.  It had just gotten dark, it was already cold, I'd been walking for three hours straight getting the Christmas and spice shopping done...and I was hungry.  \"Hmm.   Ramen?\"  Hit one more store I needed to do, then doubled back a few blocks.  I was thinking of the warm light I'd seen through the window, and ramen...and maybe they had gyoza?  Got to the door and read the carte in the window.  They did.  Montrealers don't eat supper at five on a Saturday.  Well, since I'd had breakfast at Hurley's at 12:30, this 'd be lunch.  Lunch crowd didn't get the memo, though, because I was the only patron in the place.  To my surprise, it was laid out exactly like a ramen joint on 56th Street in Manhattan that I've reviewed;  a few little tables up front in the windows, and a biggish L-shaped counter, with the cooks behind it, dominating the room.  Feeling good about familiar turf, I took a stool at the counter.  Looked around.  Drank it in.  Warm halogen light, cool Miles Davis jazz, a sushi-cutter calmly trimming some blocks of fish-ish protein...and everything was very, very clean.  The counter under my elbows was *spotless*.  And then I met my waiter.  \"To go, or to eat here?\"  In French.  \"Pour manger ici.\"  Got handed a menu.  I'd never eaten ramen in Montreal before;  only in New York City and Vancouver.  Most of the words on the menu were the same, but they featured a couple of extra adjectives.  I asked about that.  \"What's shoyu?\" I asked, figuring I'd be sneered at.  Instead, I got a very considerate explanation of what kind of broth it was, and how it compared to their other ones.  I started liking this guy.  \"Okay, then:  A plate of pork gyoza, a bowl of chasu-men in shoyu broth, and a Sapporo, please.\"  Chasu-men was described as a roasted pork and vegetable ramen.  Yeah, I could eat that.  But I'm an absolute round-heeled slut for a plate of gyoza.  Beer arrived immediately.  The gyoza followed soon enough.  Six bulging little half-circles on a long rectangular tray with a small vat of dipping sauce at the far end.  They smelled wonderful.  The waiter caught me smelling.  \"You like spicy?\"  \"Yeah, a little.\"  \"This, very good on gyoza. \"  And he sat a bottle of what looked like pepper oil in front of me.  Now, I've only ever been offered chili paste for gyoza, but what the hell.  I picked up the bottle, stared at it, and made to drizzle a bit on the dumplings, when the waiter very gently corrected me.  \"Pour it in there,\" he murmured, pointing at the vat of dipping sauce.  So I did.  Just a blot.  And I dipped.  ZOMFG.    Best.  Gyoza.  EVAR.    They were hot, they were brightly-flavored, they were plump like oysters, and the pimped-out dipping sauce was bursting with soy-y, sesame richness. I devoured them quickly so I wouldn't have time to be tempted to mate with one.  Wiping away tears of joy, I anticipated my soup.  And all of a sudden, there it was.  Reasonably-sized bowl, not overfull of noodles, lotsa sprouts and other green bits, and three big square slices of pork floating atop the whole.  Garnished with crunchy green scallion rings.  I put my nose in, and it smelled fragrant.  Glory.  As I grabbed my chopsticks, there were two quiet thunks on the counter at my head.  \"Spices, and (mumble) garlic,\" offered the waiter.  I thanked him and eyed the bottles.  The spices I recognised as a Japanese red chili powder concoction I like, but I'd never seen a jar of dessicated garlic fragments like these before.  (Had he said 'roasted\"?)  I tasted the soup as served and found it excellent but on the subtle side, so in went a fingernail's worth from both jars.  I have to say, that waiter knows how to season what he sells.  GodDAMN.  The spices took the broth to somewhere special. And the pork slices, well, they'd obviously been marinated or something, because they had depths of flavor totally unrelated to the broth.  I methodically destroyed that bowl of soup.  I even ate the seaweed.  It was, simply, an utterly delicious luncheon.  And my water glass was kept topped-off, the light and music were great, the restroom was clean and had plenty of hand towels, and my waiter was a kind, professional presence through it all.  I've had less fun and been treated worse while eating 85-dollar settings in really classy, professional places that I adore.  With a beer and taxes and a good tip, I got out of this noodle house for $26.50.  And not overstuffed.  Just perfect.  Places like this one make Montreal winters imaginable."}
{"text":"Excellent perfect for chilly night. Very good service and decent prices. If this place was in Japan it would be crowded. Stop and have a bowl of noodles."}
{"text":"If there's a go-to place for me and my fiancee, it's Ramen Ya. She works right next to the place and always goes to have lunch there. I think in total we've been there a good 35 or so times.. alone or with friends or family. The amazing thing about it is: Ramen Ya has never been short of very good. Not once did we walk out not feeling like we just had a very good meal.   My fiancee has become a bit of an expert of the menu, and she says everything on the menu is good. As a vegetarian I have tried all of my options and I agree with her. Usually I either have a soup + spring rolls (the best in Montreal btw) or a combination of appetizers.  The gyozas, spring rolls and sesame pancakes are all excellent.. The spring rolls are the best I've ever tasted anywhere - and I order them everywhere that has them. The soup is great and so is the veggie teriyaki dish.    Prices are reasonable as well... there's nothing negative to say about the place and that's why it's one of our go-to places!"}
{"text":"Tried the tomkatsu ramen by ordering at the window, the inside was full but no one was at the window. So I figured, it's not that cold tonight and ramen will keep me warm, and it did. It came out SUPER fast. Took a while for the order, but they very polite here and nice.   They have a great add on for $3 when you order a ramen you can order a mini beef bowl or a mini curry bowl, which was a great addition to the meal.   Not he best broth, and the dish was rather simple.   I'd come here again to try the other items.   Good thing I'm here for another week! Surprised they don't offer sake bombs here!  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Ramen at Bally's Bazaar shops is not what it claims to be. At most, I can describe their pork ramen as basic with a salty broth, store bought noodles, and bits of green onion and cabbage. While waiting for my order I noticed several tables left with half-eaten food?  My to go order was packaged well and stayed warm enough to eat when I reached my hotel room.   Probably wouldn't return here for ramen. Grab an uber/taxi to Spring Mt Rd and get a taste of the real stuff."}
{"text":"BEST RAMEN I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. I'm one of those people that will judge an asian restaurant by the type of people that go there because if you don't have asian people cooking your asian food or you don't have atleast one asian person in your asian restaurant... to me it's either not good or not authentic! Walk in to see older Japanese folks eating their lunch which made me instantly confident that I came to the right place! Tried it out because if the great reviews but we will come back because of the amazing food and service!!"}
{"text":"Great food and good service. Tempura Don and Katsu don are good!  Miso Ramen is a little bit salty than I expected. Overall is good! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Oh man ... I had to wait 10min to get water ... Then I had to call for a waitress for 5 min just to place order !! Then waited another 20 min to get Ramen to be served ... People are friendly but service is poor ... They need to hire 3 more waiters  :("}
{"text":"Order the yakosuna ramen; you will not regret it. It is by far one of the most flavorful dishes we have tried in all of Vegas. We were pleasantly surprised by such a small place among shopping centers. Great service, good prices! Izumi was a wonderful server; so polite and sweet. We would return again for sure."}
{"text":"Small, cozy neighborhood spot.  Long L shaped sushi counter and a few tall tables for small groups. Excellent for a rainy day, a big window to watch every other poor soul charge through bad weather while you lean over a bowl of ramen. My favorite is the veggie ramen with spicy miso broth. Now, it's not spicy but it flavorful. Sashimi is presented simply and is consistently fresh with a good portion for a reasonable price.  I tried their sesame pancake and it was heavy but tasty (cooked in oil).  Service is really friendly but always only one server so wait times can be a little long. Deal with it, it's worth it."}
{"text":"We had just finished coffee at Starbucks nearby and it was time for lunch. As soon as Hubby saw this place, his weak mind and hunger for ramen took over.  He just had to try the place.  It really is a small place with narrow counter top dining on stools which are set so close that you feel claustrophobic and if you're over 200 lbs, you'd better do take out because you will not fit into the narrow space.    Hubby really enjoyed his ramen and even asked for double noodles. The noodles are the thin, egg type.  I thought my broth (miso) was too salty.  There were a couple slices of pork, green onions, 1/2 egg and not much else.  If we had a car on this trip, would've preferred to drive to Monta Ramen over in the Chinatown dist.  They say the owner is the same as the one in SF.  I've tried the one in Downtown SF and thought it was overrated.   The chicken kaarage with 4 pieces of chicken and some sauce drizzled over the top, tasted better than the ramen. If you want ramen and can't leave the strip, this place is a reasonable alternative but if you can leave the strip, ramen elsewhere would be better.  Staff here was very welcoming and nice and I could hear some of them speaking Japanese - legit!"}
{"text":"Everywhere I go, I always try one ramen spot.  In Montreal, I tried Ramen-Ya, which was two metro stops and a few blocks walk from our hotel.  My wife and I arrived for a fairly late dinner (9 pm).  The restaurant decor reminded me of Ippudo, but wayyyy smaller.  We started with appys:  I ordered the karaage and wifey ordered the age dashi tofu.  The tofu was pretty amazing.  I think the fact that it was breaded made it better.  The karaage was just okay.    I ordered the chashu miso ramen and the wife ordered the chashu shoyu ramen.  I must say the the broth was pretty damn tasty.  I'm glad it wasn't overly salty.  The chashu slices (more than one, thank God!) was tender yet didn't have much taste.  The straight noodles were decent tasting and slurp-worthy.    This was a solid ramen restaurant.  I'm not sure if the restaurant was run by actual Japanese so I didn't bust out any Nihongo, but nevertheless, my ramen craving was satisfied that night."}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better.  The place is located in a plaza with tons of other places to eat and shop at which makes it convenient.   But its really small and narrow inside. Not so great for big groups, we had a party of 8 and they pushed two table benches together, but it was still cramped.  But they are very accomodating, and the workers here are very friendly and efficient.  The menu was easy to read and they had various things to choose from.  I went with a basic Tonkotsu Ramen, and it was seriously the most basic ramen i've ever had. The soup was bland and lacked so much flavor. The egg was a hard boiled egg, instead of the traditional soft boiled egg. And i didnt even bother eating the cabbage that was in it. And the noodles aren't the freshly made ones.  Overall, I've had better ramens in food courts. Presentation was good, but food needs work to compete with other ramen spots."}
{"text":"Hidden gem on the Vegas strip. Food was delicious and the service was amazing. The food was prepared quickly and came out hot and fresh. The prices are great too!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the best ramen in Las Vegas. The spicy miso is awesome. However, it is a little bit pricey."}
{"text":"Grand Bazaar has a bunch of small shops with a mixture of eateries and souvenir shops. We knew that we had to try this place during our visit. It said \"Best Ramen in Las Vegas\" on the poster outside!  Overall, wasn't impressed. We ordered the Karaage and Pork Ramen. Karaage was good. It was well marinated. Ramen was pretty disappointing. Bland soup and unusual Ramen toppings made me curious on why they claim themselves to be the \"Best.\"  Prices are on the cheaper side considering their location. However, I probably will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Found this gem right in front of Bally's in the area called The Grand Bazaar Shops.  Great food and price.  Clean and fast.  Great change from all the usual food, buffet, bars and chains you see on the strip.  I will tell my friends about this place, and I will definitely be back. Great job!"}
{"text":"NOT SURE WHAT KIND OF RAMEN THIS WAS TRYING TO BE (Warning: Young adults from Central Florida in for vacation) I craved Ramen- even a packet version- but before resolving to that I was glad to find there was a casual Ramen place on the Strip. It seemed legit- a small business buried among dozens of other small shops- just like how it is in Japan! Except everything else was wrong...  THE FLAVORS, THE NOODLES, THE BROTH, THE VEGGIES... NO I ordered the Tonkotsu. While the noodle texture was bouncy and solid, it didn't contribute anything else to the soup. That sums up almost everything in this Ramen.  The egg was completely boiled- not soft-boiled and seasoned like normal ramen joints- so no extra flavor there. The carrot chunks and cabbage were a bit thick; made me think of veggies in a bland Chicken Noodle soup instead. (Typical Ramen places don't use those veggies). The broth was also on less-flavor side. At least the Pork slices were very soft.  AT LEAST THE STAFF WAS NICE. CURIOUS KITCHEN The young ladies at the register were very nice. Everyone was quick at their jobs. It's still easy to find a small wait outside"}
{"text":"According to my Japanese relatives, the curry taste as good as instant Curry, the kind that they buy at a Japanese grocery store. Also, the Oyakodon was too sweet. For me, it smelled like seafood because a little seaweed was sprinkled on top and I'm not used to Oyakodon smelling like that. After all, it has no seafood in it."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I have wanted to try a Ramen place for awhile but hadn't made it to any.  I'm no expert on Ramen but the food here was tasty.  I had a simple pork Ramen in spicy miso broth and on another time I had the Yokozuna Ramen in spicy pork broth. Both times I was very pleased with the food and service.  Most everything in Ballys and in their Bazaar area is way overpriced but this place was what I would consider to be just a tad overpriced.  So by default a good deal along the strip."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????LV????4?????2????????????????????????????????????????????????~"}
{"text":"I give this restaurant a 4-Star for 2 reasons. First, there was a long wait because the restaurant is too small. Second, the veggie ramen I ordered had very little veggies and substance. It is still tasty, but not filing enough."}
{"text":"My 3 star rating goes to the restaurant not the food.  They are not very friendly, and you are elbow to elbow in a small space.  So, we took our meal back to our room to eat.    This was my first experience with eating Ramen.  I had the Miso Vegetable Ramen.  It was delicious!"}
{"text":"http://www.ktnv.com/news/dirty-dining/dirty-dining-tie-ramen-ya-and-pupuseria-el-zunzal  Premium prices but dirty enough to be on dirty dining ????"}
{"text":"Got the miso Karaage Rame (which had fried chicken, fried gyoza, and pork) in a clear miso broth and thought it was ok. Nothing too special except the fried chicken was pretty good. Was craving ramen while in Vegas so friends found this place. The waiter, however, was very nice and chatty.   PS. They do not have a restroom in the facility."}
{"text":"I've come to this place many many times, and I was always very satisfied. This place has a large varieties of Japanese food. Their ramen might not be the best in town but definitely very good. Their tempura  is top notch, better than any of those I had in sushi buffets. Although they don't have a large varieties of sushi but those they do offer is extremely good. They also have yakisoba(sauted or cold) and donburi that are some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Solid meal at a reasonable price. The combination  ramen in miso broth was tasty and was a huge portion. The chicken was outstanding. I added a little sriracha sauce to spicen it up. Ok service. It's a decent spot to go at a decent price if you have a noodle urge."}
{"text":"This ramen was just OK. Nothing too special about it. We went on a Saturday night and we picked this place because it was located pretty close to he hotel we were staying at. I wasn't too hungry to begin with but I knew that it the ramen itself was not great.   I got the tonkotsu ramen which is what I would normally get at any other ramen place. It was a little below average in my opinion. I felt like there was something missing in my ramen. But! The server was very kind and they were fast with all of our orders!"}
{"text":"The ramen was very tasty and fast The jasmine green milk tea was very good as well Glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem! Best Pho ever. I had the spicy misso and it was amazing. I was staying at Ballys and walked around a little bit and ran into the place. Service was great and extremely friendly. Great price for the strip. I highly recommend. Looking forward to returning next month, can't wait."}
{"text":"Came here at night and was a slight 15min wait. Ordered the spicy miso ramen. But due to the fact that I'm not an expect on ramen, the beef spicy miso was good. Actually really good. I truly enjoyed it. The service was good and the price was fair. About $15 per ramen and it was a good amount as well."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of ramen but this one is just meh. The ramen soup is bland, the egg is frozen. The host is a nice guy tho"}
{"text":"Service is fast. Food is good. I tried the lemon Shio for the first time from the usual Tonkotsu that I normally order in San Diego ramen places. It's good! I will go back again when I go back to Vegas."}
{"text":"I usually like to have tried the place a couple of times before I give a full review but I'm not sure how many times I'm going to be back here and it was very fast service and tasty. This is smack dad on the strip in front of Bally's casino grand bazaar and being a local, I hardly go to any quick restaurants this close to the strip but I was here for awhile and it had just rained so hot hearty soup sounded like a good idea and I was not let down.   Great fast service that I got to go. Tasty and conveniently in a tall container that made it easy to eat. Little bit pricey but understandable for location and quality."}
{"text":"Prices ok 11-12 average for a bowl or dish. It was very quite no music when we were there. Service was very good and we got our food fast. They were attentive to our waters which was flavored lemon without asking. Ramen was ok. I had the fried chicken in my ramen the chicken was really good. The noodle some cells were just OK for Ramen. It's a small place but very convenient if you are staying at a hotel near that area. They pay conveniently by a tablet. Basically I give them a four out of 5 and really good service but decent food"}
{"text":"this is a great find in a city full of so many franchises. located down one of the rows in the shoppes in front of bally's. i spent $9 for a huge serving of spicy miso ramen, and 50 cents for \"extra spice.\" it was a little light on meat (2-3 thing strips of pork), and other toppings (a few tempura onion puffs & green onion), but the flavor was awesome. definitely a unique lunch option and a good bang for your buck next door to shops charging 20 bucks for a lobster roll. also super fast service on a weekday at lunch time and very portable. try these guys!"}
{"text":"Yes we have Ramen-Ya in Hawaii but OMG the broth was to die for... seriously. And on top of that the other ingredients were just as delicious. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Omg I might be biased because this was my first time having Ramen but it was bomb. It was 6 of us we all got something different and everything was delicious."}
{"text":"So it said that it open at 9:30am and here I am waiting till 9:30am and they haven't open the door. Me and friends wait for 20 minutes and still havent open. Is the time correct?"}
{"text":"Fantastic ramen! I was mad that I couldn't finish it all. I ordered the karaage spicy tonkotsu. The spice level was mild/medium and I made no requests to modify the flavor or heat. I added no condiments. The service was fast and no fuss. It's up to par with my favorite Toki, in DC."}
{"text":"Visited this place today for a quick meal. I was surprised to find this place in an izakaya, I guess it's own by the same people.   They do not have a huge selection for ramen. I ordered the spicy miso broth with chashu and my partner ordered their signature classic ramen. I tried both lol. Both ramen were good but not amazing. I wouldn't go out of my way to get ramen from here. The chashu was really good though, it had enough fat and flavour. The takoyaki was ok , again nothing amazing. All in all, I thought it was pretty expensive for what you get. There was not much noodles in the ramen and I also felt like there was too much bean sprouts. Maybe if I'm around the area and there's no other places to go to..."}

{"text":"Noodles undercooked, egg way over cooked.  \"Best Ramen in Las Vegas\"? No. I've had better packaged $0.20 ramen."}
{"text":"I can't have pork broth, so I got vegetable broth with miso ! I also got fried chicken and beef for $3 extra ! Phenomenal and staff is really nice and courteous !"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite ramen shop in vegas. It's so cute inside and the ramen was sooo yummy! they tell you to pay first and i think that's way better because when you're done you can just leave w/o waiting for someone to get your bill/pay/etc. the meat wasn't soggy like most places. their menus are kind of confusing at first but they'll def help you out. but 10/10 definitely coming back."}
{"text":"They have all kinds of japanese meal that I've been missing since I started living in the us. But ramen was just a overpriced instant one. Not good at all."}
{"text":"O..M..G...Authentic ramen!!! Very authentic ramen...This IS it!  Looks like the exact ramen places in subway Japan...very small...eats max of 10 people only...  their ramen is to try and will keep you coming back!!! I am coming back tomorrow.  Yummmmmy!!!"}
{"text":"I left this place unimpressed and rather disappointed. My sister and I were walking through the street of St-Laurent looking for a place to eat and we decided to give Ramen-Ya a try as I love Japanese food. We ordered a bunch of stuff.   It started well with the kim chi : I don't think Kim Chi can ever taste bad anywhere.   We also had the salmon sashimi salad : it was so-so. The portion is really small. It was like a basic salad with 5 pieces of really thin salmon on it covered with a bit of sauce. It wasn't amazing.   Next comes the tuna tartare. The tuna tartare was entree size. There was a lot of tempura mixed with the tuna and they laid rice under the tartare. It also comes with sliced cucumbers and small pieces of seaweed. Personally, I liked it better as is : only with the tuna and not the seaweed that takes away all the flavours from the tuna. The presentation of this plate was really cute though.   Then we had the \" spicy \" chicken wings. It tasted like diluted tabasco.. which is not really what I'm looking for when I order spicy chicken wings from a Japanese restaurant.   Lastly, we ordered the \" Chirachi \" which is a plate of rice filled with salad and salmon sashimi. As I was taking a bite, I felt something really odd. I pulled apart my slice of salmon only to discover that there were a hair burrowed inside of it. I told the waitress and she brought it back to the kitchen.   I don't think I'll ever come back again as the food wasn't really impressive and the staffs didn't leave me with a great impression, except for our waitress who was really sweet."}
{"text":"Ramen used to be pretty good, but on my last visit the quality had deteriorated big time!! Short ribs were greasy - Noodles tasted like instant-noodles - Spicy beef broth was bland - Beef in ramen soup was dry/not fresh - Too expensive given lack of quality and our order took way too long!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite ramen place to go to! It has so much flavor and big portions, I can never finish it when I come in and sit down! It's also very cheap and It's not too far away from any hotel. I've tried the chicken curry and it's delicious as well, I've never had a problem with this place if I could give it more stars I totally would. It really is the best ramen place in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great little Ramen spot @Ballys. The Ramen was moderately priced and the girls loved it. Very little talking or phone use at this meal."}
{"text":"Little hole-in-the-wall place at the new Grand Bazaar shops right outside Bally's. Can never find any good and affordable pho or noodle places whenever I'm in Vegas so after a quick Yelp search I decided to try this place out, especially because it's a 5min walk from Bally's, which is where I was staying at the time. They have other options other than ramen, I saw a Sushirrito looking thing and some appetizers so I'll have to try that next time. Small small place, only a few tables to sit at. My friend and I decided to get to go and eat in our hotel room. In small print on the menu you can change the broth to pork base instead of chicken, and being a ramen snob I love love love love pork. I had to pay extra for that though. Overall taste for being accessible on the strip = 7/10. Definitely was overpriced though but I guess what I'm paying for is the convenience. It served as an excellent hangover cure and I even had enough to eat at 4am after a night out. Def will come back when I'm craving soup on the strip. 3/5 stars for overall quality and price."}
{"text":"Spicy tonkatzu with fried chicken and gyoza, have to say it's kinda weird because they usually to be separate, but it turns out to be surprisingly good. Vegas doesn't lack of famous chain restaurants like Le Cirque, Nobu and Hakassan, but had enough of them during this long conference stay. Spicy ramen is just the perfect thing to go when craving for sth different.  One point reduced as the egg is not the typical ramen type of egg as it's too fully cooked. The spice level is right, a little oily though. You cannot choose the level of noodle hardness, and it should be medium strength. Location is easy to find among many other restaurants near the Bally's sign.  No corn in the soup unless pay extra. Plenty of seating inside."}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy ramen, and it was very good. The food was ready in less than five minutes. I took it to-go and it was still nice and hot when I finally sat down to eat. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the ingredients throughout the bowl were super yummy. I can't wait to try more things that they offer on their menu the next time I visit! :)"}
{"text":"Located at the Grand Bazaar Shops this Japanese food place is amazing! Ramen, curry, and sushi burritos? Whatever you would like to order it's quick and oh so good! I work at Paris and Ballys and need a quick Asian fix so here is the place to be, if you can't make it in time in Spring Mountain."}
{"text":"Since last time I was here. They've done expanded out a lot more. I remember when they were one of the first establishments here at the corner. It was hella small and hella tight, now there's proper seating. Not just barstools on shelving on a wall like the good old days.  The dining area now is very generous. It can definitely accommodate a large party. It's well lit and pretty spacious. Spacious enough that everybody can sit comfortably without the claustrophobic feel.  The ramen is really good. I definitely think that their broth is well balanced,, that's as far as I'm concerned. Their gyozas are pretty good too.  Anyways, I had a great dining experience here. The place was awesome, the service was hella prompt and extremely attentive. I love a good bowl of Ramen on a cold day.   Thanks for reading my review, I hope this helps. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!"}
{"text":"I'd really like to give this place 4 stars, but there are some things about it which makes it an A - Ok place.   Firstly, we 'll talk about the positive. Ramen-ya has a great ambiance and vibe to it.  It's quite spacious and you can see an open kitchen.  The appetizers were very delicious as well, quite a variety! My friends ordered sashimi, okonomiyaki, while I ordered the spicy salmon tartare. It was definitely appetizing and really tasty.  Now the negative. The service? So slow!! Luckily my group wasn't in a rush, but  we were there for almost 1 hour 1/2 before we received our appetizers. The main came not too long after, but there was barely any ramen in it! I had the katsu (pork cutlet) ramen and it was delicious, but i felt like the portion size was a bit too small for my liking.  I'd prefer Misoya, more expensive but the broth is more tasteful I find. Service is also quicker. So don't come here if you are hungry because expect a long wait. At least that's what happened to us that Friday evening."}
{"text":"This place is situated in one of the shops around the Bally's entrance. It's a perfect spot for hunting for Ramen. They play paid Pandora and change the station based on their patrons. Right now I'm listening to some classical jazz and there are some Japanese patrons that are also dinning here. My wife's noodles were a bit overcooked and mine were about right. The Spicy Tonkatsu was not very spicy nor was it piping hot when it came out. The pork chasu that came with it was not as tender as some other ramen I have tried and it was priced well above average.  Most other patrons have rated this place at 3 to 4 stars and I would agree that it more closely feels like a 3 star joint. Come for the quick and easy ramen fix."}
{"text":"Eh, the ramen was okay/good but I've had better. The base is a little bland and I would have liked to see more toppings. Also, they have a boiled egg instead of a softened egg with runny yolk which is traditionally served with ramen. They also had no chicken option, which I get is more traditional but at the same time it would be nice not to have to chose between pork or vegetarian. They also don't have fountain sodas so you're left with no refills."}
{"text":"A nice little taste of Tokyo in a deceptively low key establishment. Great egg noodles and rice dishes. Family friendly, and a nice way to get some green vegetables: they were happy to bring extra steamed broccoli which we were craving. Everything very fresh and tasty.  Noodles are highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is worth finding (not that difficult) seating is very limited but we did not have an issue on a Monday night. We ordered the spicy miso, the soy ramen, and the gyoza. Everything was fresh and flavorful. Dinner for two of us was under $25. We will definitely be here again"}
{"text":"C'est le restaurant le plus proche de la tradition Japonaise que j'ai trouvé (excusez moi pour mon manque de culture) à commencer par les Ramens. J'ai jamais mangé une soupe aussi bonne! Tout est possible; soupes froides, soupes chaudes, épicé, douce, poulet, porc, buf.. Sushi, viandes froides. Mais venir pour autre chose que les Ramen ce serais un peu dommage vu la spécialité! J'ai vu beaucoup de commentaires sur le service lent mais pour y avoir été plusieurs fois, j'ai toujours été servi rapidement. Les serveurs (qui parlent le vrai français!) sont juste un peu plus low-profile que d'autres restaurants et c'est bien! J'ai plus l'impression de manger que de voir du service en permanence. J'y suis allé pour ma fête et c'était fantastique. La fraîcheur est là à chaque fois et j'en ai vraiment pour mon argent avec les portions servies!  Mon seul bémol est la carte. Bien que joli, il faut absolument l'aide d'un serveur pour pouvoir commander. Les inhabitués du Japonais n'y comprendrons rien au jargon."}
{"text":"Best. Ramen. Ever. Get yourself a bowl and enjoy. Everything is good; chicken, pork, and vegetarian ramens were tried during my trip and they were excellent. Spice lovers will like the spicy miso broth, delicious!"}
{"text":"I ordered the beef spicy miso ramen. It was delicious! Not too much heat so should be edible (and super tasty!) for most people. The restaurant itself is pretty cramped and it fills up to an almost claustrophobic level. That being said, service was quite friendly and attentive.  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Save your money elsewhere. Just ugh...the eggs are over cooked, the boodles are the ones that's out of some dried ramen package, the soup is too salty. Just not authentic Ramen."}
{"text":"The breaded pork tasted like bread. Caged fried chicken worse than toufu. Force 18% tips."}
{"text":"The place is always full of people so I was really looking forward to trying out their ramen.  Ramen-Ya is also referred as Kurobuta Izakaya.  Kurobuta is berkshire pork, the very best.  It's a pork equivalent of Kobe beef.  We went for an early lunch on a Saturday.  Unfortunately the ramen simply falls short, because of their broth.  Ramen broths are tricky to make.  It needs to be fresh, rich and flavorful.  Their broth is fresh, but lacks the other two essentials.  Maybe that why it's called Ramen-Ya when I search it in Yelp.  :-)"}
{"text":"PROS: 1. The resto is very small and quaint. The lighting highlights the food yet is dark and red at the same time. Good for those who get the Asian glow from alcohol! :)  2. The ramen was yummy but nothing special.   OVERALL: -Cute intimate little place for a date or casual eats.  -Not a place I'd rave about, but a good option if in the area."}
{"text":"Great place, good service and very tasty food. Small place and not too noisy, excellence if you want to have a great conversation over a meal :))"}
{"text":"After several days of eating expensive and terrible restaurant food at the south end of the strip, this was a godsend!   It was the cheapest lunch I had in 4 days!  The service was good and the server friendly and made some menu suggestions.  The ramen soup had potstickers, boiled egg and slices of pork; it was very good.  I wish I found this place earlier."}
{"text":"Hanging out between tacky souvenir shops and 2 for 1 bars, this quaint little restaurant is seductively whispering, \"Hey there, we got noods!\" Ramen is the perfect hangover food. It's soupy, it's carby, and it warms your soul from your aching head to your busted feet. How smart of you, Ramen-Ya, to situate yourself within hangover central right in the middle of the Strip in Bally's Bazaar.    Sometimes, authenticity is a little hard to find in Las Vegas, but Ramen-Ya offers up a good, hearty bowl of it. You can tell, from the Japanese staff to the Michelin recommendations, that you're in for a treat. They offer various forms of ramen, \as well as curries, rice bowls, and Japanese side dishes like Gyoza dumplings and Karaage fried chicken. They even serve boba tea! (Not Japanese, but who doesn't love boba?)   After a weary night doing entirely wholesome things, my girlfriends and I decided that ramen was the way to go. They offered various broth options with toppings that include beef, pork, veggie, and fried chicken. I had the lemon shio (sea salt), while the others had tonkotsu (pork bone broth) and spicy tonkotsu. Each contained some form of protein, thin noodles, a slightly overcooked half egg, a bit of black garlic oil, and a surprising amount of veggies for ultimate recovery.   I personally loved the lemon shio. It was light, refreshing, with just the perfect amount of salt. The spicy ramen was appropriately spicy. While we all agreed the tonkotsu was not the best or most flavourful we've ever had, it was still very satisfying. One of us got karaage in the ramen, which got a little soggy from the soup sadly. This is not a unique problem to Ramen-Ya though as a lot of ramen places do this (why??)   $20 for a nice bowl of ramen served by friendly staff who were always on top of water refills. Not the worst way to spend $20 in Vegas, that's for sure. At least it isn't something you'll feel guilty about telling your significant other.   (41/100)"}
{"text":"This ramen place is super tiny and tucked away but the ramen and the wraps are on point! I will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Outstanding ramen. Very friendly staff. So hard to choose which one I wanted, but all of them looked amazing."}
{"text":"Today I was craving Japanese Ramen so I decided to look up ramen spots around me and this place came up. Did my research and this is the sister company of Katana-ya based in San Fran who has won the Michelin recommendation which is prestigious in the food world.   This place is located within the Grand Bazaar shops. The size of the restaurant is small but I've lived in Japan and most ramen places don't have a lot of square footage so this is spot on if they're trying to get the traditional Japanese feel.   Enough about that, let's get down to the food.  Yokozuna- I ordered the spicy miso broth and it comes with 2 pieces of chicken karaage and 2 gyoza's. Man oh man this broth was on point and the noodles were fresh. I highly recommend this place to people who want to try quality Japanese Ramen on the strip without the high price.   Beef Donburi- This dish has onions, ginger, sweet soy sauce and of course ample amount of beef on top of the rice. This dish was okay.. Nothing to write home about lol..   If you're around the area I highly recommend this place. Also they're doing a face lift on the menu."}
{"text":"Waited 70 minutes for the first dish to show up. The restaurant wasn't even full. When asked about it the dude said because you ordered too much. Wtf. Never gonna return."}
{"text":"The yokozuna ramen came with just about a little of everything (fried chicken, meat slices, etc). The noodles were a bit overdone and the soup could be a bit more flavorful.  My husband ordered the miso ramen along which he thought was just average as well.  Overall, this cute little restaurant would make a perfect date place.  It is quite small so I can assume it would get quite crowded on a busy date.  It is in a great location among other shops so you can walk around afterwards.  Our waitress was very nice and attentative and took the time to explain things to us."}
{"text":"Rally good place! Hits the spot every time we are in Vegas and need a Ramen fix! All of the options with fried chicken are bomb!"}
{"text":"For a small little place, it hit the spot. My girl friend and I randomly decided to eat Ramen on a 105 degree day and finding this spot, like I said was like a quickie. You're in, you eat good Ramen (noodles were not hard or overcooked either, broth was on point), have a couple shots, and you're out! Love it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is under the same management as San Francisco's Katana Ya, so if the name looks familiar, well, that's why!  This shop is located in the Grand Bazaar Shops of Bally's. It's pretty tucked away from all the madness of the Strip. The shop is really tiny and only seats like 10 people max, so I wouldn't try to come with more than 4 people, really.  The food is priced very reasonably, especially when compared to the rest of the Strip. Entrees are about $9-$10 for reasonable portions.  I got the fried chicken curry with rice. The curry was actually quite good, very homey taste. I guess it could have been a bit warmer temperature wise, but oh well. The fried chicken was a nice touch. I was surprised to see that the vegetable curry and the fried chicken curry were the same price despite meat being more expensive in general.  I would come back again, sure."}
{"text":"This ramen restaurant is located in the alley of a cute row of shops. You can either sit at the bar where you would be seated outdoors, or you can choose to be seated indoors. There are water mists if you decide to sit outside so you don't burn from the heat (especially in the summer).  As for the food, they have a huge range of food choices. I ordered the chicken donburi, and was pleased at the portion. However, it was too salty for my liking. Not sure if you can request them to put less of the sauce if you order this dish, but that would be my only complaint! The staff is friendly and the food was tasty."}
{"text":"Very salty ramen, reasonable gyoza. Kalbi is slightly over-seasoned. Definitely not one of the best places I've been to for ramen, but for a late dinner on a cold night in the neighborhood, it does well. Service is quite slow."}
{"text":"Quick, efficient and friendly services! Like the others have mentioned, prices are pretty good considering you are on the strip.   I ordered the fried chicken spicy ramen.  It came quickly but the chicken was just warm, probably made in advance, the egg was way overcooked. The broth lacks flavour and the noodles are just ok."}
{"text":"Eh, I wanted to be blown away, but for $9 ramen, I was less than impressed. It wasn't much better than what I could do at home with doctoring up some ramen. I guess it is on the Strip though, but still. I had a TON of noodles on both visits, with only 2 or 3 pieces of meat and half a hard boiled egg. Really nothing special. I'd rather have pho any day. I don't get the ramen fad. I've gone to a couple ramen places now, and it's just not as fulfilling as a good bowl of pho."}
{"text":"We stayed at Bally's and found this in the little mall strip right in front of it! Small shop and looked busy, so we were hesitant to try, but I am so glad we did! We were a little confused with how to order as it was our 1st time eating at a Ramen place. Our server was very nice and helpful! We had the Karaage Spicy Miso Soup and the Beef Donburi. Food came out within 10 mins of ordering and everything was delicious! We had an amazing service and enjoyed our meal we made another trip before leaving Vegas. Definitely will be back when we are in town!"}
{"text":"So good sushi burritos and ramen. It's a fast food place.. don't go expecting sit down dining."}
{"text":"We stayed in the Bellagio resort during my stay, and this place is soooo close and convenient since it's just across the street. For the three days that we stayed there, we had it twice! The ramen was good but the curry is better! We had the special ramen, it comes with two fried chicken pieces and two pieces of gyoza. The first time we went there for dinner we ordered take out, it was packed, but they were quick with the orders, however they charge you for the SECOND empty container, the first one is free, and the second one is $0.5 and etc. We went there agin the day we were leaving for lunch, plenty of seats, and they do not have a bathroom for customers."}
{"text":"The map of Bally's shopping mall is totally wrong. Raman Yakatana is in the middle section of the left part of the mall. I ordered a spicy ramen and fried dumplings. they're good when the weather is soooo freezing cold outside!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a Ramen fix, this is the place for you. It's pretty small location so of you go with more then one other person you won't be able to eat in but you can always get it to go , to your room if anything  fair price as well."}
{"text":"Convenient location if you're staying on the Strip - just in front of Bally's. But I think I sacrificed quality for convenience and would not come back for ramen.  The noodles, broth and everything were just mediocre.  Standard hard boiled egg, tonkatsu broth was oily - just underwhelming.  The others in my party got Katsu Curry and Katsu Don - they were happy and thought it was tasty.  Restaurant is SUPER small, with counter seats only - about 10 seats.  Not good for little kids.  All in all, an ok meal, but nothing worth returning for."}
{"text":"This is such a cute place! My friend recommended this place when we arrived to Vegas! It's a must for anyone who loves or craving noodles! :)"}
{"text":"Not bad at all for trying ramen for the first time.  I believe it was the owner who approach us and was explaining the flavors, portions to us. Since I order the veggie one, he suggested I ordered spicy flavor because if not, that it would be too bland. I liked it a lot. Can't wait to try one with meat in it."}
{"text":"I've been to many Ramen restaurants and dives in my life, so when i saw the sign for this place next to Bally's, saw their house was packed, and read some reviews here on Yelp, i decided to try it out.   The prices seemed reasonable for the location (normally you'd pay about 25% less in Chinatown, USA for the same meal). I had to wait ten minutes in line, and put my name on the list.    Amazingly, this place bills itself as the 'best Ramen in Las Vegas'. This is self-proclaimed, not a 'voted best Ramen by (insert name of obscure Vegas magazine or website here), so it takes serious balls to make such a claim  Bottom-line verdict from a non-Azn guy: I thought my non-spicy Miso Ramen was...average at best. Not a lot of flavor on the Miso soup, the veggies were nice and fresh, the Ramen noodles al-dente, and the fried chicken quite tasty. But overall nothing popped. 'But this is ramen', you say? Like I said, I've eaten great ramen in Alhambra before, and this wasn't great. Just average. Don't waste your money on the mini curry bowl either - the curry is flavorless and you only get one tiny potato piece."}
{"text":"The restaurant was smaller than I expected. There were only around ten(?)tables. We were a group of three. We ordered 2 Ramen Tonkotsu(?) and 1 Ramen Miso. The serving is good for 1-2 persons. The meal was good but I think they could do better. The service was fast and the old Japanese man was really nice. He was always smiling and very courteous. The service charge was included in the bill. Overall it was a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Hmmmmm des ramens!! Y a-t-il plus grand plaisir qu'un bol fumant de ramen quand le mercure commence à baisser? J'ai testé leur bol de spécialité de la maison, et oh boy que c'était satisfaisant. Le bouillon est très, très costaud, et le tout exulte le umami. Délicieux. Très triste qu'ils soient fermés les dimanches, par contre; je suis dans le coin tous les dimanches, et j'aurais mangé là chaque semaine! Bon, finalement c'est peut-être mieux pour mon porte-feuille..."}
{"text":"I don't understand why they charged me 18% of tip without my agree. I wanted to tip as I wanted but they already charged 18% and included on the check. They told me they were charging 18% because my group was 5 people. I know they can charge me 15% if 6 or more but they said 5 or more. Seems like good service, but I was really upset with that."}
{"text":"This is my favorite ramen place.  I visit Vegas once a year, and I always have to stop by. The owner and staff are very friendly and informative. Ramen is very robust as it should be."}
{"text":"I was seated fast and ordered the Spicy Miso. It came with Gyoza, Fried Chicken and Beef along with eggs and onions. For $19.99 I got a beer and the best Ramen I've ever had from all my travels around the country.   Found outside the Ballys hotel in the Bazar shopping area it's a gem and the best bang for your buck! Other places charge $25 for a small bowl and it's not very good too!   This is a must try!"}
{"text":"Easily the best ramen on the strip! The noodles are excellent! I highly recommend the pork ramen with Tonkatsu broth  and the beef ramen with shoyu broth. The ramen here is excellent and the service is great! I loved the gyoza!!! Everything was perfect ! Must try!"}
{"text":"I just want to start by saying that I have never stepped foot in Japan yet, so I can't compare Japanese ramen to ramen served here that claims to be Japanese.  That being said, I'm a fan of this restaurant.  We were 3 and were immediately greeted and sat down on a weeknight. Service is great and they do pay attention to us.  We had 2 appetizers for three, and we thought that it was enough. The portion sizes are adequate and great for sharing. About 3 minutes later, our beer were served, then another 5 minutes later, we had our Enoki Beef and Takoyaki (Octopus fritters) on our table. Taste-wise? A solid 8.5/10. The sauces blended well together, and it was warm/hot - fresh off the kitchen.  For my entree (main course), I had the house special ramen (Chashu Tonkotsu). I watch a lot of YouTubers eating their ramen, and just like them, I tasted the broth first. The broth was great, not oily, not bland, it was good - nothing more but nothing less of 'good'. I enjoyed it but will not order it again because their menu is huge! If I come back, which I will, I am ordering something else.  Recommended 4.25/5 star for me.  What are you waiting for? Go reserve a table and enjoy a nice cold beer, great food, and great company!"}
{"text":"Ramen -Ya is the only ramen restaurant that you can easily access in the strip. It is located in the Bally's shopping center. It is quietly small but it has some seating outside. I ordered the Veggie Ramen. Even though, the noodles were good but the broth could have been more flavorful. The soup was really plain. I wish it could have added more seasoning into it. It is a good place to try if you are on the strip and don't have car to drive to Chinatown."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in my list for a long time. I have a high expectation on it. But the food is average. I ordered spicy beef ramen, the soup is very tasty, but the texture of beef and noodle are hard. Also salmon bowl is very small.   The only dish I like is the mixed BBQ, the chicken skin skewer is tasty."}
{"text":"We weren't impressed with the ramen we ordered. The meat was very fatty and there weren't much noodles. I warn I am a bit spoiled since I lived in Japan so an average customer may grade this place four stars at best. Would love to give this place another try if I'm back in town. The staff was friendly and we didn't have to wait for a table. Just don't bring in outside food or drinks, there's signs everywhere."}
{"text":"Meh.... I'm not a connoisseur however I've eaten at a lot of ramen joints all over San Diego, Hawaii, Washington and Los Angeles.    Ramen Ya Katana is located at the Grand Bazar Shops by Bally's Hotel.  I just arrived to Las Vegas and wanted Ramen.  I remember seeing this joint a few times before so I made my way there.  The inside of the restaurant was very busy and I placed my name on the wait-list.  I walked outside and noticed that they have 4 chairs at the window so I sat there and ordered.    It was  a perfect night for Ramen.  The weather was not cold nor hot so I wasn't sweating while eating my ramen.    Food:  Tonkotsu Ramen (with pork chashu, vegetables, boiled egg) I asked for my noodles to be al dente.  The server didn't know what I meant so I explained that I want my noodles hard and under-cook.  He said okay but unfortunately when I got my ramen it was overcooked.  I asked for more black oil in my ramen.  It lacked a bit of flavor but still good enough.    Beef Bowl (with onions and rice).  The meat was very tender and a good taste.   Service by RJ was alright.  I will return again when I'm in town since it's on the strip."}
{"text":"Very good ramen at a small little shop.  Not the best Evers but well worth the stop.  I was craving a little ramen late night and they were right there.  Staff were all friendly, definitely hit it up after the show for a little 1130 pm snack."}
{"text":"We went for late lunch to Ramen becouse it was suggested by NYC chef. Place look very big compare other ramen joints. We got vege dumplings, house ramen and chiken with the noodles...in my opinion everything have almost the same taste. Service was very slow.  I dont think i will go back."}
{"text":"The house special ramen tastes very salty and the portion is so small compared to its price (14 cad before tax). I don't recommend students like me to eat there."}
{"text":"Very cool decor resembles a cargo container with cool Asia swag. Staff very friendly but a bit slow. Ordered Veggie Ramen spicy cause I thought it might not have flavor. The broth used was the miso soup broth and noodles were not made here but fresh to freezer then hot water. Veggies slightly over cooked and the boiled egg was not soft and runny it was hard hard boiled. This dish could have easily been cooked in my room."}
{"text":"This place is located in the Grand bazaar shops at Ballys casino hotel. So while me and my friends were browsing through the shops we saw this place and decided to give it a try. Now there isn't  much to this place it's really small, but it's  not too crowded. The service is good here as for the food it's alright. I have ate at plenty of ramen places and this would be the first choice  on my list if I wanted to go to ramen again."}
{"text":"I had their signature dish, Yokozuna Ramen, I chose Lemon Shio. The serving was very large and very flavorful. This dish contains a variety of different ingredients, all of which were tasty! Although I am not skilled in the use of chop sticks, I was offered a fork, which I appreciated. The server was friendly and helpful. A very satisfying lunch! The seating area is very small and you might be seated next to someone else if they are busy. It was worth it though!"}
{"text":"I don't think anyone would expect too much from this place, so I guess it matched my expectations. It's just a little stall right on the strip off the sidewalk by Bally's. The ramen didn't have much taste, kind of watery, but hey it's cheap and right on the strip where there isn't exactly a ton of competing ramen places, and comparing to the other options in it's immediate vicinity, it might be the best choice."}
{"text":"Got the spicy tonkatsu Yokozuna and it was amazing will definitely be back. Even got katsudon to go. Tell your friends to stop by this little ramen shop"}
{"text":"The sushi burrito was odd, but the karaage and spicy ramen really hit the spot.  Not the best I've had, but for Vegas Strip standards this is good.  The location is really small.  The location is really convenient on the strip."}
{"text":"Delicious budget friendly food on the strip! I tried the fried chicken tonkatsu ramen, awesome!"}
{"text":"I found this place via Yelp because we were craving ramen, but did not want to leave the strip. It took us awhile to track this place down since it was in a hallway full of odd shops, but we made it.  The restaurant is extremely small. It probably seats in total, around 10-15 people. We decided to give it a go anyway since it took us awhile to find it. The staff was extremely friendly. The woman who was helping us answered all our questions and recommended her favorites. We ordered the fried chicken curry and a bowl of shoyu ramen.   The portions are large yet affordable. The food came out quickly and everything was pretty good. The curry was my favorite. It wasn't too salty or greasy. The ramen was alright. It was the best ramen I've had or the worst. The broth was really fatty and the noodles weren't that chewy. There wasn't a lot of toppings in the ramen either. But for that price, it wasn't bad at all."}
{"text":"Decided to go here with the bro cuz we wanted some Asian food and wanted to try a new place. There was a bunch of people in line so I guess it's a pretty popular place.  I ordered the shoyu ramen and tonkatsu while my bro got the tonkotsu ramen. The noodles were okay, nothing really special about them. You can also tell that they store them as blocks because I had to mix my ramen in the soup to loosen it up. The shoyu broth didn't have a strong taste to it while the tonkotsu broth seemed a bit diluted. The chashu was pretty tough to chew and didn't really have it's own flavor. The tonkatsu was pretty tasty with the sauce and had a nice crunch factor, but unfortunately it was still pink in the middle. The staff was nice enough to redo the order. If you order this dish make sure to check to see if the pork is fully cooked because you don't want to risk getting sick from it. The second order was okay but I think it could have used a bit more cooking.   Overall this place was decent, but I don't think I would go back here. Chinatown is close by and has cheaper and more delicious options. If you are stuck on the strip and are really craving for some ramen I guess this place could suffice."}
{"text":"Great spot.!! I'm currently staying at Ballys and it's convenient that this spot is right next to it. Very friendly staff and food was delicious had the spicy miso ramen."}
{"text":"Still dreaming about this ramen one week later. It was so flavorful and filling. But not filling to the point you can't move. The perfect post hangover meal. And it was the most reasonably priced food we came across the whole weekend."}
{"text":"I had a Tokyo sushi burrito and it was excellent.  The flavors were great and the size was good.  The only thing was it could have done without the lettuce but it wasn't bad in it.  I stopped in just as they were just stopping the rolls but they made one for me anyways.  I'm going to have to stop by and try out more of the menu next time I'm in that little shopping center."}
{"text":"Great spot for ramen lunch and ice beer. I'd come back for a good bowl of ramen anytime."}
{"text":"This place isn't fancy, but it was a perfect spot to grab a quick (and affordable) dinner while site-seeing on the strip.  The ramen broth was very good, but I didn't love the cuts of chicken used.  If you don't like dark meat chicken, I'd suggest ordering something else.  The restaurant is small, but people are in and out so quickly that we didn't wait long even though there was a list. The staff was super nice!"}
{"text":"kinda pricey.I had chicken skewer, enokit beef rolls and pock ramen"}
{"text":"Ramen-ya is located  on St Laurent. Unlike other Ramen places, this place is big and they can accommodate large groups. The meat in the ramen (pork) is really good. The thing that bothered me was the broth. Was not impressed. Also the Karaage was a big disappointment. It had a thick fluffy layer of batter and it wasn't crispy at all. That's not how Karaage is meant to be. So my quest to find a good Ramen place in Montreal still continues. Sorry Montreal, but Toronto still has an upper hand when it comes to Ramen joints.   Food : Good, Not Great Service :Fast Ambiance : Casual Worth the price : Yes"}
{"text":"Better than I anticipated, I order 2 bowls just to test out how the noodle are for party of 4 for my family and once try the broth I end up order another bowl cause it is very good. Recommended especially for Asian population"}
{"text":"Again a huge let down. Asked the cook a question and instead of taking the 2 seconds it would have taken to open his mouth and answer he POINTS to the cashier. There's so much more I could write based on today's visit but it would boarder on being cruel. Food haS NOT improved."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good ramen-ya. I don't think that it's run by Japanese, but nevertheless they seem to produce a fairly authentic bowl of noodles. Noodles are fine, if unexceptional. The roast pork was tender but had little substance. The soup was a bit of a let down, however - lackluster and uninspired. Overall it's satisfactory, but I wouldn't be rushing back.  The takoyaki, on the other hand, was very good."}
{"text":"Nice environment, good ramen and broth. The price is reasonable compared to other over price restaurant around. Nothing beat a bowl of warm noodle soup after having too much buffets."}
{"text":"J'aurais mis 3 etoiles et demi, mais Yelp le permet pas. Tout d'abord, le resto perd une demi etoile pour la tenteur du service. Repas 2 services en 1h30 c'est long, surtout pour le genre de nourriture. Les restos Japonais sont reconnus pour etre rapide, pas celui-la, ou bien pas un mardi soir. Ceci etant dit, les serveurs sont ultra sympathiques et connaissent de quoi ils parlent. Le decor est chaleureux et japonais moderne, parcontre il y a seulement des tables hautes? Wtf? Ce qui veut dire qu'une personne en chaise roulante ne peut pas manger dans ce resto? Y a une table pres de l'entree qui etait hauteur normal, mais je suis pas sure (je vais mieux investiguer la prochaine fois). Moins une demi etoile pour les tables hautes, que je deteste par la meme occasion: j'aime quand mes pieds touche parterre. Par ailleurs, les enfants sont bienvenues, mais pas de chaise haute.  Coté nourriture, j'ai beaucoup aimé, mais la barre est haute depuis que je suis allé chez Kazu. Nous avons gouté deux drink, un aux agrumes avec des morceaux d'agrumes confis, wow c'etait trop bon! L'autre avec produit laitier, mais ca goute pas le lait: c'etait bon, mais pas wow! Pour entrée, nous avons pris la salade d'algues aux sesames, qui m'a surprise car je suis pas une fan des algues, c'etait franchement delicieux. La soupe miso epicee et les gyozas aux crevettes etaient bons, sans plus. Nous avons partagé une soupe ramen au boeuf epice, encore la c'etait bon, mais je ne suis pas epatee. Le gout du boeuf et la texture etaient exceptionnels par contre. L'assiete de sashimi et tartare etaient parfaite, le tartare etaient savoureux. Le riz en dessous du tartare avait du vinaigre de riz, c'est pas tout le monde qui aime ca!  On a pas eu le temps de prendre un dessert :-( car on etait presse par le temps, mais y a beaucoup de choix et honnetement ca fait saliver.   Je vais y retourner c'est sure...a suivre!"}
{"text":"Saw a sign walking around Bally's for the best Ramen in Las Vegas. Wow what a joke!  This is the shittiest ramen and the shittiest noodles I've ever tasted. I got the tonkatsu ramen because ramen should be pork broth based not chicken. The cha shu pork was not even pork belly just some cheap salty cuts of lean pork. The broth just tasted like salt and vegetable oil...what pork broth?? The egg is supposed to be soft boiled but they hard boiled it to the point where the yolk is green. The noodles were clumpy, doesn't even taste like ramen noodles. Also, it was covered in a layer of generic chili oil that I did not ask for with some pieces of cabbage floating around. It was cheaper than the ramen back at home (Philadelphia) I guess, but omg this is so bad. You get a bowl of Frankenstein noodles but it ain't ramen!"}
{"text":"Was craving a bowl of Ramen due to cold weather. Came in and was greeted with mediocre service. Got the spicy Miso and the noodles weren't cooked very well. They also left all the flavoring at the botttom so when you Get to the end you get spoonfuls of really salty concentrated flavoring. Meat was also mediocre."}
{"text":"Came here on a monday afternoon for some lunch. The staff here is fast and friendly. I had the spicy beef chatsu, which I was told was only spicy tasting and not spicy burning. The difference is if you will be paying for it later, which the lady told me I wouldn't (but I did, I SOOOO DID!!!). Anyways, it was delicious, and the two spices they give you really add to the flavor of it. Their green tea was also very delicious. The place is a bit small, but cozy. I would say the price is pretty expensive for what you get, but I think it's because one of us had ordered from the bento box, not too sure though as I didn't get a receipt, nor did I care."}
{"text":"This place is tiny!! It's tucked away in a shopping mall and we had to ask directions two or three times to find it. The dining area is just two counters facing opposite walls (tight squeeze, for sure) but the ramen was brought our quickly. Each was a pretty good portion size-- but I also eat like a bird. It was very good and very VERY filling for me. I ate so much I actually felt sick afterwards."}
{"text":"The soups are great! When i con back to Vegas this will be my first spot especially after a hangover . It's small very intimate great customer service . Light music and super quiet"}
{"text":"My spicy tonkatsu was more like a bowl of Malaysian Maggi curry flavored instant noodles than ramen. Nevertheless I wanted something Asian on the Strip, so this will have to do."}
{"text":"Wonderful little Japanese noodle house located in the prime of the Las Vegas strip. All of the workers were thoughtful and polite. Refills on refills. Try the spicy tonkotsu ramen if you're down for that good. I'll be back fasho"}
{"text":"The food was ok (had much better tame- had v little meat) but what turned me off was the 2-3 hostesses were incredibly rude and were rushing all of us out (made us pay 2 minutes into ordering? gave us the stink eye when we were done but didn't leave immediately, kept interrupting our meal to ask if we were done). They did this to the table next to us too. I know they were busy but seriously- was ridiculous!! Won't go back ever. Don't recommend unless you like being treated like shit."}
{"text":"This place did not disappoint.  It's very good.  Very flavorful and just the right umami.  My noodles were cooked just right, a little audente. It had pork slices that melted in my mouth.  I enjoyed the mix of sliced cabbage and spinach.  Since i like spicy,  they have the extra japanese dried peppers in a bottle on the table w/in reach..  I  found this place on the strip.  Must stop if you are in the area.  Fast service, inexpensive, very clean too.  I'm a fan and will do this again another  or the next time."}
{"text":"If you haven't had a sushiritto, you haven't lived. Okay, maybe not that extreme, but I feel that way. We ordered a sushiritto and were going to split it between us.  They accidentally made another one, so they gave it to us for free.  This burrito was amazing! Great flavors throughout the burrito and great amount of spice from the wasabi.  I loved it! What a great concept.  Next time I am trying the ramen from this cute place in the Bazaar Shops."}
{"text":"Not the best Ramen. Packaged ramen at the store will taste better than this. Haven't tried anything else, but would advise against it. My group and I  didn't even finish our food at all."}
{"text":"I ordered the Very Spicy Miso Beef Ramen. And my husband ordered Spicy Tonkotsu. It was both delicious with good flavor! Spicy was not spicy to me but that's okay because I eat lots of spice and to most people, I'm pretty sure it is spicy to them. And the price is affordable!"}
{"text":"This is the best ramen I've ever had. We ordered the beef ramen spicy miso and it was EXCELLENT! Amazing spices amazing flavor. We also ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl and it was the freshest homemade sauce, yummiest rice and great chicken. We will be back every time we come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"This soup is not hot. I do not like this noodles. I dont even eat it. I recommend you to go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"A delightful bowl of ramen.  Popped in here for a quick lunch mid conference.    We got very welcoming and friendly service and our waiter swayed me to go for the ramen with it all - fried chicken, pot stickers and pork.  This was a buffet of treats in my bowl.  I had the spicy miso and it was PERFECTLY spicy.  Enough to make me sniffle throughout but not too much that I couldn't eat almost the whole bowl and enjoy it.    I would say it's a bit of strip pricing because my ramen was just shy of $20 with tax and tip.  That being said, it was flavorful, delicious and served with a smile.  Water was refilled without hesitation and they were speedy with our check and payment so we could get back to the grind."}
{"text":"Right now is 9:48am but the store is still not open when website hours states open is 9:30am!    We came yesterday at 11:00pm and they said it's closed the whole restaurant due to cleaning in restaurant and told us to come tomorrow at 9:00am! Poor management!!   I wouldn't recommend coming here! You don't know when they would open or close. Very unreliable!!!"}
{"text":"YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   the best kept secret yet, this is real deal ramen. I ordered the spicy miso ramen and omgggggggg heaven in my mouth! Literally.... I thought I somehow escaped my body and had been telepathically transported to Japan. I thought I left Vegas...I instantly fell in deep lust for these noodles.  Super affordable and open late night if you're in Vegas this is a MUST you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Refreshing little spot on St Laurent (and in my heart): clean, calm, tiny, restful, not too bright, friendly knowledgeable staff and delicious cozy ramen. I'm not an expert but a friend who had lived in Japan for years pointed me here and I was not at all disappointed. Not the exceptional shiney purity of tastes and ingredients as at Kazu, but a huge cut above a lot of the grizzly bar food on the Main. I've only tried the spicy chicken and a vegetable ramen so far, both healing big bowls, deliciously flavorful, not at all greasy, super comfort food. The price is under $20, so typical for Montreal, but a meal like this would be cheaper in less expensive cities, and on less expensive streets (the rents on the Main have gone bananas.) C'est la vie I guess; I'm awful glad  Ramen-Ya is around."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places that serve good ramen. Tonkatsu is my favorite. Its affordable and good sized portion. Restaurant  kind of small but who cares right as long as food good. Workers there very friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Loved the ramen! Was very flavorful and they have a good selections of combo in the ramen. The service is also very good. Not bad for the price!"}
{"text":"*3.5 stars*  Yuuum! I wish the portions were a little bigger! My friends and I stayed at Bally's... we were scrambling to find a place to eat, and luckily we stumbled upon this place!   It's a cute, small restaurant located in the plaza down from Bally's. I enjoyed the Ramen I ordered, it was Shoyu on the front page of the menu. Staff was friendly and service was on it!"}
{"text":"This has become my go to ramen place in Las Vegas. It's a quaint place, but do not let it fool you. They often say that the small places give you the biggest belly, or so I want to say I'll make this catch phrase catch on. But one word for you, AMAZING! I had the spicy miso ramen that had the 2 chashu pork, 2 gyoza and 2 chicken kaarage. The broth has an intense flavor, I slurped it clean.   It was a great experience, I would come back every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Noodles. Ramen - so warm and seasoned. Edamame - firm and green, joyful to eat. And delicious lime squash, the best liquid drink. Tasty!"}
{"text":"Small little restaurant but good quality. The price is very reasonable. Love it. Ramen was so good."}
{"text":"The food was delish, ordered my first sushirrito and it was really good. Ramen was also very satisfying, very flavorful. The place was tiny but the food was grt so I am happy."}
{"text":"For a small shop to get Ramen and curry, it's good for the price. Great winter time. I'm not a fan of ramen, but this was a pleasant place.   Small place to eat, like 10 seats at a small bar. Food cost about less than $10."}
{"text":"You want a great bowl of miso soup and noodles? This is your place in LV. It was my first time here and loved it. Price is reasonable too. Its a small place and way too tight/crowded to sit and enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"Portions are good. Shoyu broth was tasty. My only issue was the Ramen noodles were not cooked properly and were not tasty at all. Decent pricing, if you are nearby I would recommend but do not go out of your way for this Ramen shop."}
{"text":"Depuis le temps que je voulais manger un Ramen et bien voila chose faite. J'ai testé avec un ami qui voulait lui aussi un peu de changement.  Le cadre est sympa et le personnel accueillant, je pense que nous avons attendu seulement 5 minutes pour avoir une table en plein rush.   Coté nourriture nous avons décidé de prendre la formule avec une petite entrée et le ramen. Certes l'entrée est petite mais bon on était plus la pour le Ramen. J'ai décidé d'en prendre un qui était un peu relevé et je vous conseil de ne pas croire quand ils disent \" un peu \"... C'était un peu fort pour moi mais vraiment bon.   Franchement j'ai vraiment trouvé l'endroit sympa et finalement pas si cher pour ce que nous avons mangé."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in a rush to grab dinner before our Cirque du Soleil show. We told the waiter we were in a bit of a rush and he said not to worry. With that, we were seated immediately and they took down our orders. The waiters were so accommodating with our time crunch!   We had the tonkatsu and the spicy tonkatsu ramen. Both were sooo flavorful and rich! I have lived in Hawaii as well as visited Japan so I have a high expectation of what ramen should taste like. I currently live on the East Coast where the ramen game isn't as strong or authentic... You need to try it!!!!! It's a quick and affordable spot to grab food on the Strip."}
{"text":"Had a cold front passing through with wind and temperature in the 50s, decided to eat something warm. Found this place in front of Baly in the bazaar shop. Quick service and no waiting. Ordered beef ramen in miso soup base. Beef very tender and flavorful. Only thing is I don't like the noodles. They are soft and kind of like the package ramen that they sell in American supermarkets."}
{"text":"Delicious Ramen, great location, great service! We always search for the best ramen houses wherever we go and Ramen-Ya does not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I came here at almost 2pm, It took me a while to find the shop as it was small and not boldly labelled/signed. Finally found the place, escape the Vegas heat, ordered at the counter. I had the Miso ramen and fried chicken. I found myself a quiet corner and my noodles and chicken came quickly. The soup base of the ramen was a little salty but nothing a bottle of water can't wash down. The chicken was moist and hot, crispy yet light. Yum. I regretted ordering only 1 order. Next time then.  The server came around midway thru my meal and checked in on me. She was friendly and helpful.  Will be back again."}
{"text":"I know there's a lot of disagreements on the best ramen place, but I've always felt that ramen ya lives up to their reputation no matter which store I go to. Their broth is always flavorful and their meat melts in your mouth. Their staff is consistently quick and polite to their customers. They know how to do business!"}
{"text":"This ramen spot is the bomb! We went on a late night and it was jam packed! We opted to sit outside instead. We ordered the ramen in tonkotsu broth and curry with pork tonkatsu. Everything was delicious - we literally licked our plates and bowls clean!"}
{"text":"If you are out on the Vegas strip and need a quick Ramen fix, this is a good spot. I know fresh noodle or noodle texture is a change in the whole taste arena, you wont get that here. The broth was good. Sometimes I am too quick to order and expect it to just come with all the toppings, so take a moment to look into the toppings, it will definitely change the broth flavor."}
{"text":"The $23 combo is a good deal: appetizer, ramen, Sapporo. The spicy beef ramen is really good and not too spicy. I think I ultimately prefer Yokato Yokabai"}
{"text":"They have eat in space but only for 10 people and bar counter seats. Ramen is very good. Their name is Ramen Katanaya I believe. It's on a first row from Flamingo rd"}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! This was my boyfriend's first experience having Ramen, and it couldn't have been more enjoyable for him. The spicy miso ramen is off the hook! Also thank you to our sweet waitress, she was super sweet explaining the menu to us and was so attentive!"}
{"text":"Great staff, nice spot, and decent vegetarian options! Wish the vegetarian ramen had some boiled egg or other heavier toppings with it-- but I'm sure staff would have helped if I had asked.  Definitely would try to stack on some add-ons if you want some extra flavor."}
{"text":"Nous sommes allés avec notre garçon de 12 ans. L'ambiance était tranquille car un mercredi soir assez tôt, nous étions presque seuls, mais dès 8PM il y avait déjà beaucoup de gens qui arrivaient. Le staff est très low profile mais j'aime ça ainsi. Les prix sont adéquats par rapport à la qualité. Nous avons très bien mangé dans un temps raisonnable. J'adore que l'on puisse choisir nous même viande versus bouillon pour les ramens."}
{"text":"Ok. By far the best traditional Japanese food I've yet experience here in Montreal. Mixed drinks are good, portions are wonderful, and the entrees all seem extremely appetizing. Sake is at a decent price. The waitress was a darling to my family and I."}
{"text":"Spicy tonkatsu ramen was very salty and kind of one noted for the vegetarian ramen as well. Decent but wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"It claims to be the best ramen, I would say it's the only ramen.  I got the basic ramen with tonkatsu broth, the noodles were a nice thickness, not too wide not too skinny. I didn't like the cabbage bits, but maybe bc I thought they were dumplings and that is a disappointment that is hard to recover from.   Broth wasn't too salty, my friend thought it was oily but I liked it. A lot of noodles!   Onigiri didn't have much stuffing, my other friend got the salmon one, very little salmon in comparison to the rice.   And the sushirrito was weird with the flour tortilla..."}
{"text":"Was craving ramen so badly and was pleasantly surprised to see this in the plaza area at Ballys! It was convenient and cheap by  Vegas standards. The ramen was great in the winter weather, but by no means amazing. Good, big portions, but the broth was not as flavorful as I would have liked. The eggs were completely hard boiled and the pieces of meat were small. But I thought the fried chicken and gyoza in the ramen was an interesting concept, never had that in my ramen before and can't decide if I like it, but it was still good. If you're craving ramen and you want to stop by somewhere on the strip, this is a quick fix!"}
{"text":"The dumplings are delicious, the Ramen soups are flavorful, the meat is tasty and tender. And to add it all, the service is great. My girlfriend and I go there to satisfy our Ramen urges and have never been disappointed. I even find myself trying new things once in a while, like the fried octopus balls (really not my thing), but I'm glad I tried.   Simple downer, it's hot in there."}
{"text":"AWFUL, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. \"Vegetarian Ramen\" was literally just water with ramen. Owner came by and stated that if he was the one who took our orders he would have told us not to order it because it has no flavor.  My husband ordered the Chicken Karaage Ramen. Tastes like store bought undercooked ramen straight from a plastic bag. Egg in ramen was cold and hard boiled so much that the yolk was green/gray. When our order of gyoza never came we asked the server about it and with no apology whatsoever she said she had only put down two bowls of ramen and no gyoza and that she can add it now. Gyoza arrived a deep fried mess with tons of air bubbles and inedible.  I have eaten at ramen joints all over the world including Japan, this was hands down the worst ramen experience I have ever had."}
{"text":"Very bad service. The food is so so. And they have a compulsory 18% tip. Totally insane!"}
{"text":"I came in at 5pm on a Saturday night with a group of four and we were seated immediately. We didn't want to overstuff ourselves, so we ordered 3 dishes to split between 4 people. Our waiter told us that was a great idea since the portions can be quite large.   We ordered a miso ramen with chicken karaage, spicy tonkatsu ramen, and a chicken teriyaki bowl. All three items arrived to our table within ten minutes and were all quite delicious! The chicken karaage was so yummy! As well as the chicken teriyaki. We all preferred the miso ramen over the spicy tonkatsu.   Overall, we were quite pleased with our visit and our waiter was so funny and helpful!"}
{"text":"Loved this ramen place right on the strip. Great food. Fast. I had the beef ramen and it was excellent. The service was also fantastic. It was really busy when we went in on Friday night, but we were seated quickly and served right away. Great recommendations for my sister, who hadn't eaten proper ramen before. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Raman----YA!!!!! We had the miso, flavorful and filling! I wish that my egg had been soft boiled, but otherwise it was perfect!!! And the darling Japanese couple sitting next to us were making very happy yummy noises, confirming my opinion."}
{"text":"I was going to give this place 3 stars and tell you about the Las Vegas sushi burrito and the Tokyo sushi burrito that I tried, but I went back the next day to try their ramen I was not happy with what I was looking at. As I was getting ready to order I was looking in the soda cooler out in the customer area and I noticed that there was raw chicken being stored in the soda cooler. The public had access to the chicken they would be serving to customers. That is unacceptable. No review for you!"}
{"text":"Ramen-Ya? More like Ramen-Yay! This is a great place to get some ramen on the strip, which is actually kind of rare! The price is reasonable for the value and you get good quality food. The service was quick and easy!   Awesome!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty ok. The ramen was not what i expected but it was still good. I got the 3 mix and that was good but the noodles were plain. I will come back for the sushi burrito though, they looked so good."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise to find a spicy ramen near the strip.  Great ramen and good service. If you need something to soothe your belly after a hangover, this is the spot for you."}
{"text":"Cute and cozy! Perfect for a quick date night or a quick bite to eat. Ordered a regular size spicy Tonkatsu and it was delicious. My advice is make sure to order double the noodles."}
{"text":"If you want the best ramen in town, it's worth it to drive to spring valley.  I've tried sora, tatsu, kobo and now katanaya and kobo is by far the best.  The ramen I had tonight, the eggs were hard boiled, not soft and the ramen noodles were definitely not the freshest. The pork was a major let down too. Watch videos of how chashu pork is made before you go there for maximum let down."}
{"text":"The seating area is extremely small but the food comes out within 5 minutes so consider taking your food to go and enjoying it in the comfort of your hotel room."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now.  First let's talk about what this place is not.  It's not the best ramen in Las Vegas.  It's not the 10th best ramen in Las Vegas.  It's really bad ramen - the noodles are out of a package, the broth is maybe semi-homemade and not very good, toppings are just okay, the hard-boiled eggs are embarrassingly awful.  I can, and have, make much better ramen at home.  If you want good ramen, tourists, I suggest you take a cab to Jinya, Monta, or Sora, which are all fairly nearby.  The other dishes are much better.  I particularly like the beef bowl, although I wish there were a little more beef for the price.  There really aren't that many places on the Strip where you can get real(ish) food for under $20, super fast.  If you are stuck on the Strip, you can do a lot worse.  I will keep coming here, just not for ramen."}
{"text":"Ramen-ya Katana doesn't get a lot of love from people passing by, but I enjoyed the food and service here. I was fortunate enough to dine here with family when there was only one person eating. Not only did we get to take our time ordering, but we were able to chat with the staff and the proprietor, Koji--a former sumo wrestler. I grew up in Okinawa and this was the first time I met a sumo wrestler. It was an awesome opportunity to meet and take a few photos with him. The service was great, but let me cover the food:  Yokozuna Ramen $13.50: If you have a large appetite, this is the largest ramen they offer. It has half an egg, kakiage, two pieces of gyoza, two pieces of karaage, and two slices of cha shu pork on a bed of perfectly cooked ramen noodles in a very rich miso broth (we specifically requested miso instead of pork-based). The kakiage and gyoza soaked up the rich broth, as did the karaage--making them all very flavorful and juicy. The cha shu pork was a bit thin to my liking, but still tasty. My only gripe is that the egg was hard boiled and not soft boiled.  The Miso Ramen ($8.88) is in the same miso broth, but with slices of cha shu pork only. A family member ordered this and she thoroughly enjoyed it. As for the portions, Koji and his staff are generous with the broth and noodles. You will be full when you eat here (granted you like and finish your food). Sushi burritos or \"sushirritos' are also offered if you're into those. I personally haven't tried them, but they look pretty good. One downside about Ramen-ya Katana is that there are eight very cramped seats on the left side of the restaurant. The stools are small, and the small space can make it a little warm while eating.  Our ramen was served piping hot, which we definitely appreciated. The ramen I've had in New Jersey sucks (most ramen places in NJ aren't authentic), so even in triple digit weather, the food definitely hit the spot and filled a craving. There are more popular ramen places in Vegas, but Ramen-ya Katana is a solid option if you can't make it to Ramen Sora or Monta Ramen."}
{"text":"First of all, I've never been to Japan, so I know nothing... NOTHING I TELL YOU!  For those who don't know about ramen, it's Japan's version of poutine except some people actually think it might be good for you (see my \"Resto La Banquise\" review for the same comment, only in reverse).  I really like ramen in general. I still eat uncooked instant ramen all the time even if I've been over 12 years old for more than 20 years now.  Ramen-Ya has nothing to do with that though. If you've never had real ramen and aren't planning a trip to Japan any time soon, this is probably the best ramen shop you can find in Montreal.  Tasty, fat, chewy and messy, ramen are amazing food that will prevent any hangover and a really good way to make yourself look silly in front of a date, slurping and splashing away in your broth as your noodle slide off your chopsticks.  Have fun!"}
{"text":"Ehhhh... I'd say save your money.   The waitress was super sweet and it was perfectly located next to our hotel, buuuuut, the food wasn't good. My ramen lacked flavor and the vegetables tasted like freezer burn.   It's nice that it's open late (we were there at about midnight), but I don't think we'll be going back."}
{"text":"Small little spot hidden from the strip. I really enjoyed the rice dish and the ramen was really good! Definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"Not worth the money at all. I bought a 10 dollar shrimp sushirito and there was only one tiny shrimp in it. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Food was decent but way too expensive. My pork kazu was nice but the sauce wasn't amazing. The food took about 30 minutes to make even though the restaurant was empty."}
{"text":"Second time I've been here and I can tell their food is consistent (5 months apart). This place is great for a quick bite of ramen when you're on the strip and don't want to drive. The broth is on the bland side, the egg is hard boiled instead of soft, the noodles aren't exactly fresh, but I don't think I've ever had better service at a ramen shop outside of Japan"}
{"text":"Shoyu ramen was not bad! It includes chashu pork which was very soft, and veggies like cabbage, spinach, carrots, and bean sprouts. The soup was flavorful and rich, was just a tad bit on the salty side. Their noodles are made from egg so it's a bit different in taste and texture. I just wish they had ajitsuke tamago (Japanese style marinated egg) instead of normal hard boiled egg in the ramen. Still an enjoyable meal!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I had my reservations when I saw this little Japanese restaurant on Boul St. Laurent. I thought it was going to be another one of those multi-hyphenated cookie-cutter sushi place around Montreal. But my reservations were thwarted, slightly, by the fact that it's name has the word \"ramen' on it. I HAD to give it a try especially when that picture of a bowl of ramen looked so inviting, and I was a glad I did.   I love ramen and I love it even more when it is done right. My favorite ramen on Ramen-ya's menu is their chasumen shoyu ramen and all the dumpling types they have on their menu. There are four soup flavors, shoyu, miso, spicy miso and curry. While some purist might even shun at the idea of having multiple kinds of ramen instead of specializing in one, I kind of like it that there are options. Never mind that the owners are Chinese but let us not get into the history of noodles. This is as good as it gets with bowl of piping hot, soothing, tasty ramen with a nice slice of roasted pork, complementary veggies and seriously delicious looking floating globules of glistening fat that's just the right amount.  Also, try their zaru soba dishes. Their tempura shrimp zaru soba is simply out of this world. It's the perfect cold noodle dish for a summer's day. I was never a fan of cold noodles until now, that is.   I am really glad I found a joint I could hangout and have a delicious meal for lunch during work hours. And I have now earned a title as their frequent client by now, I suppose, I have been back more than 10 times in 3 weeks.  Ramen-ya is a gem in the city of Montreal."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered spicy miso ramen, chicken katsu curry and gyoza! Affordable and satisfying. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Despite living in a city that does not have a ramen restaurant, it is still my favorite food.  That makes a ramen joint a must-see in any city I travel to.  I chose Ramen-Ya simply because of it's proximity to where I was staying.  Upon entering the restaurant, I was quickly greeted by a friendly hostess and seated. The spacious restaurant was dimly lit, but not in a way that detracted from the setting.  Our waiter saw to us swiftly and recommended the ramen special combo, which got you a regular ramen, four gyoza, and a pint of Sapporo for $20.  I went with this option, ordering the Spicy Beef Ramen and Pork Gyoza.  The gyoza arrived first and was nothing special - not great, not bad, but sufficient.  The ramen on the other hand, was tremendous.  The broth, my favorite part of any ramen, was extremely flavorful.  The meat was tender and the soft boiled egg was cooked perfectly.  The only part of the ramen that was night delicious, were the noodles themselves, which were a little too soft for my liking.  Other than that, the soup was great - and with a pint of Sapporo to wash it down with - a worthwhile meal."}
{"text":"Ok, please disregard the over rating of 3.5 stars. The reason is people don't understand that the ramen here is the best and waist their time on other things (that are still good but it is called Ramen-Ya). It is the best ramen in the city and with the trip up Saint Laurent for it. It is always perfect and the staff and atmosphere matches it perfectly. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place, the staff and the food.   The r25 and d24 are awesome and the pancakes are top notch.  They have 2 menus for lunch and dinner, so be sure to go back and try more"}
{"text":"Depuis la fermeture d'Ichiban, voici maintenant mon comptoir à Ramen préféré de Montréal. Les nouilles sont toujours fraîches et le bouillon est savoureux. Pour ma part, je préfère le ramen au buf dans un bouillon miso épicé. L'ambiance rappelle un peu les véritables brasseries japonaises, mais dans un cadre plus chic, voir plus \" trendy \". L'été, une petite terrasse qui donne sur le boulevard St-Laurent ajoute au charme de l'endroit. Le service est relativement rapide, et le service est très courtois.      Je retire une étoile à ma note à cause des prix élevés des ramens. Un spécial ramen avec entré de dumping, accompagné d'une bière Saporo: 21$, service non inclus. Délicieux oui, mais à ce prix, on ne vient pas tous les jours.   J'en profite pour passer un message à nos amis restaurateurs japonais de Montréal : pourquoi les ramens sont-ils si dispendieux ici dans notre métropole québécoise, alors qu'il sont un repas très abordable au Japon (et en Corée) ? N'est-il pas vrai que la soupe de ramen est l'exemple même du repas beau-bon-pas-cher au Japon ? J'ose demander la question : à quand un ramen vraiment abordable à Montréal ?   J'attends ce jour avec impatience..."}
{"text":"Great service! The Spicy Miso Pork Ramen was delicious! Multiple refills on our ice waters saved the day!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best ramen I've had in awhile! the burrito Sushirrito was good. I wanted a seaweed wrap but the tortilla was still excellent! The ramen was bomb though. Seriously recommend. Service was super nice! And the food came out fast!"}
{"text":"A surprising treat! I love Japanese food, and the reviews were good, so I gave it a shot. I'm so glad I did! The service was super quick and friendly. The food was DELICIOUS! I had the karaage shoyu ramen. The chicken was cooked perfectly, the broth was tasty, the noodles the perfect consistency, just all in all a great meal. And so inexpensive for the Strip! The place is tiny and not much to look at, but if you love ramen, definitely come in for a great meal at a great price!"}
{"text":"I was on my way back to the hotel from Marche Jean Talon and super hungry. Came accross this ramen place on St. Laurent Blvd.  Ramen was pretty good, you can't really benchmark against the one that they have in NYC. It's quite good...  Ordered the tonkotsu and pork cheek. Both of them were delicious, fatty, and salty...  If you're in Montreal and in the mood for Ramen, come visit this place."}
{"text":"There is so much \"right\" about this place. First the staff is friendly. Even though the restaurant is small, and perhaps because of it, it feels right. Ramen Ya reminds me of alley noodle shops of old Korea. I ordered spicy tonkotsu ramen with chicken and extra noodles, and the dish hit the spot completely. It was spicy enough and the fried chicken was delicious. Very pleased!!"}
{"text":"Le resto préféré de mes enfants. Sushis frits, crabe à chair molle frit, et une bonne sélection de nouilles. On aime y commander des petits plats qu'on partage. Ou pas. Bon rapport qualité prix mais service quelconque."}
{"text":"We were led to our table, handed our menus, and then ignored for 20 minutes while other tables that sat down after us ordered. When we tried to flag down a waiter, he dismissed us without acknowledging our wait or giving us an idea of when we would order. 5 minutes later, we left.  tl;dr: Maybe you'll have better luck, but I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"The place itself is nice, clean and big. The broth in my ramen was incredible but my biggest disappointment is that the noodles are not the real freshly made ones. :( In conclusion, I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen with beef. Pretty good overall. The wait was short and the staff was friendly. I work on the Strip so it was easy for me to get to. Not sure it was good enough for a specific visit down to the Strip to get it but if you're in the area check it out."}
{"text":"This little ramen place is not as expensive as other restaurants on the strip tend to be. I like it for its homely atmosphere and it relaxing vibe. Even though it's a little cramped with its limited seating, it is still a nice place to get a quick bite to eat. The ramen was served fairly quickly and the servers were very polite. One of the only problems was that the ramen tasted a little too salty, but the portion was well worth the price.  -ke"}
{"text":"Awesome food  at a great price!!! A true gem  I'll definitely be back for more when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Fast delicious no holding back on this perfect joint.   If I had to complain, which I wouldn't, would be to keep this joint open later."}
{"text":"Best ramen broth in town imho. Nice end-of-the-week vibe. Superb gyoza. The noodles themselves tasted a little like top ramen, but I guess that's more a compliment to top ramen than a knock on Ramen-Ya. Try the mushroom appetizer - delicious!"}
{"text":"Took my kid to eat here.  Good service nice atmosphere and good food. The prices are average and the service is fast. I ordered vegetable noodle soup and it was really really good. The only thing is that you need to look for that place because it's in between an alley that is on the strip   It's really hard to find it and I found it by accident. If I ever come by again definitely I will eat here again. I recommend everybody who loves Japanese food to eat out there."}
{"text":"A small little back alley ramen shop by the Strip. From the outside, you'd expect a sleek hipster look but to say the least the interior was not my cup of tea. It was awkward, congested and just poorly thought out.   As far as service... it was ok. The waiter took my order and took my money, that's about it. No \"service with a smile\" if you will.   On to the food! Meh, just meh. The price was slightly higher than other ramen joints but it should have been at half price IMO. The miso ramen was sooo watery with no flavor and the pork was a sloppy cut of meat.   All in all, do yourself a favor and go off strip to one of the other ramen shops Vegas has to offer... trust me"}
{"text":"I work here at Ballys and I was so excited to see a ramin and sushi burrito take out, something different for lunch. I was very disappointed.  To pay $9.00 for the Tokyo and not have fresh avacado but a cream, and the spicy tuna warm, and not cold, was not what I was expecting.  I have had better sushi burritos at at lessor price.  Needless to say, I will never go their again."}
{"text":"I wanted a quick, cheap, light bite on the strip and thought this place would be good.  Disappointed in everything, except the service.  The soup is all a chicken stock and it tasted like nothing.  I got the spicy and all I could taste was heat, there was no flavor.  I love spicy, but spicy with flavor and heat, this had no flavor at all.  The noodles were cooked well and tasted fresh, but there was hardly any meat and it was not good.  Everything is served in a plastic to-go soup container, which is probably practical on the strip.  Anyway, the point of the story is although the place looks cute and the service is good you can get better ramen by doctoring up your $0.25 package from the store.  And for the price, just don't do it!"}
{"text":"I visited montreal this summer and had to give their ramen a go. I got the spicy beef ramen (when in canada, get.the.beef.) It had a ton of meat in it. The broth was a nice flavor but it was more sweet than spicy. It kind of had a teriyaki vibe to it. In comparison to places in the states it was cheap. It was a big bowl that I barely finished. The toppings were ok, nothing stellar. The egg was great. It was the cooked white but still jelly-like yellow. I appreciate a non overcooked egg. I bet this is the place to go in the winter for a big hot bowl of ramen."}
{"text":"first of all my friend ordered from postmates and she ordered sapparo sushi burrito but instead they gave the post mates driver a beer. second of all, the ramen i got isn't as good as other ramen places. if y'all want real ramen go to jinya, ramen sora, monta ramen, hachi and god damn even the cup of noodles is better than what i got. i am asian btw so i know the difference between good ramen and bad ramen. my ancestors are ashame of this place. yall better give my friend a damn refund!!!"}
{"text":"This isn't actually a ramen restaurant, it's an izakaya owned by Chinese people. Their ramen isn't bad but it's not memorable by any stretch of the imagination."}
{"text":"Excellent and tasty ramen. Our first trip to Vegas we went twice during our trip. Our second trip to Vegas Ramen-ya was our first stop! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Decor and ambiance is pretty cool , so were the beer selections and cocktail menu. However , food quality is really low for the price . I ordered a salmon tartare that was 75% rice so was not excited for the appetizer . The ramen I ordered was decent  but not the best in Montreal. Just disappointed in general because the menu has every picture of the food items and the pictures all look lovely and appetizing but when we got the actual food it looked like all you can eat tapas just assembled ."}
{"text":"Ordered a Sapporo sushi burrito and tried giving a Sappor beer to my Postmates driver wtf is wrong with you guys!"}
{"text":"You have to stick to the Ramen...or maybe the Fried chicken curry w/rice. Other items were not that good or this review would have been 5 stars. The place is small but pretty clean and the staff is very nice. If you want ramen at a very decent price (especially for the LV Strip), then this is your place. We'll definitely be back there again when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very good Ramen spot especially after a night of drinking...hostess was very funny as well check it out if you want to avoid the crazy lines in the hotel and on the strip..."}
{"text":"Had the spicy tonkotsu ramen. Delicious! Noodles were perfectly aldante. A jem in the midst of the overpriced Vegas Strip. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great cozy decorum with hidden deli menu pannels underneath some paper frames on the walls. The place looks really laid-back with an open-space kitchen cranking up some (bare my words): \"really LEGIT food\". Portion for price ratio was acceptable and taste was homey, comforty and certainly not americanized. The offerings aren't plenty and that is why I think I liked that venue from the get-go!  House beer was sharp and good with the edamame. Ramen soup and my buddy's curry were both delish. Nothing to say...  My waitress was okay but kept interrupting my conversation, never looking at the usual table signs to know whether to come or not. She also struggled to understand french... and weirdly english aswell. She was probably just having a bad day.   Not a perfect experience but a MUST go again!"}
{"text":"I've been here only twice, but it's a place where I want to go back again. Although their service is little bit slow, the food makes up for everything. Their ramen broth is so good! And takoyaki have generous amounts of octopus. Eating yammy ramen and sipping on pink plum wine is the best, definitely worth a visit if you're a ramen fan. I'm definitely a fan and will be coming back here again."}
{"text":"First of all, I must say, Ramen Ya Katana is really tiny!  The dining area (counters facing opposite walls seating no more than 10 total) is extremely cramped, and the bar stools are high and uncomfortable.  I would suggest wearing comfortable clothing if you are going to be dining in.  And ladies, there aren't any hooks for purses, none that I could see at least.    Their ramen (most at about $10) comes in one size only, and it was too much for me to finish.  I ordered their Shoyu Ramen.  Maybe I'm just really picky with my ramen - there's only one ramen shop that has really impressed me and my taste buds - but I wasn't really all that crazy about it.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing; my dining companion ordered the Spicy Miso and really liked it.  The girl bringing out the food seemed really nice and service was good overall, which leads me to this three-star rating.  Btw I didn't see any uncooked meat in their soda fridge, but then again I didn't look in it."}
{"text":"We had the shoyu ramen... Came late at night so there was room inside to eat in.  The broth was hot and tasty... The noodles cooked perfectly... Good on a cold night... Friendly service and clean atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Good food and fast service. You get to choose your soup and meat, and also add any side dishes. Even the takoyaki tasted really good."}
{"text":"Great Food, Friendly Locals, Amazing Host!  Ramen-Ya has been my favorite restaurant experience in months.  I was in town for my brothers bachelor party, and after a rowdy Friday night the five of us needed to recuperate before diving again into the fray.  Being a rainy day, thoughts of warm food and soup created a longing for Ramen, that once shared with the team was exactly what we were all looking for.  A quick search of Yelp, and we were on our way to Ramen-Ya!  We arrived around 7:30 on a Saturday, and ironically the only seats available were at a table for five.  I know we were lucky as all of the other seats stayed full all night long.  We ordered drinks and appetizers, and they arrived quickly.  Sitting near the bar, the regulars at the counter were fun and easy to talk to.  But everything got even better when our Host came to talk about the menu.  I love Ramen and have eaten all of it's iterations from the \"Top\" to the bottom, including specialty shops in five different Japanese prefectures.  I Like Ramen.  But I have never experienced the joy of a Ramen house that you see in the movies...ever seen \"Ramen Girl\",  or for that matter even Po's father in Kung Fu Panda?  There's supposed to be something special about making Ramen, that I've never experienced it before.  Until Ramen-Ya.  As I was saying our Hostess arrived at the table and talked to us, at length about the different broths she had been working on that day, what was in them, what she thought would be best paired with them, and about what we each liked.  Red Meat, chicken, spicy, sweet, she covered all of the bases, and helped us each make our own perfect choice.  And we all did.  We shared across the bowls, and drank beer, and laughed with the other guests, and with the sushi chefs and the hostess.  We stayed for about an hour and a half, and were never rushed or pressured, and had exactly the type of experience you want to have when you have your best friends together for a good time.  Montreal, you are lucky to have Ramen-Ya, long may you support her!"}
{"text":"Perfect??It is cheap and delicious. The ramen is authentic. If I visit Las Vegas, I will come here again."}
{"text":"???... it's very small bowl. Am 120lb woman and never finished any Roman bowl, but this one is not enough for me. And it's full of aginomoto. After eating I was so thirsty.  This is a good experience. Never choose under 4 stars restaurant?"}
{"text":"The best Ramen you will EVER taste!!!!  Best noodle dish! It's in a small space but it has the very best flavor. The staff is super nice. Try the green matcha boba tea it's so good. I had the beef ramen spicy. Extra noodle. It was so delicious!!!"}
{"text":"As much as I enjoy the wealth and diversity of restaurants The Strip has to offer, there are times when something simple and straightforward are all I need.  Back home, pho, ramen, and Chinese noodle spots are my jam, so when I came across Ramen-Ya in the Grand Bazaar in front of Bally's, I was intrigued!  Especially since it was such a cold night!  A sister restaurant of Katana-Ya in San Francisco (once one of the best ramen shops in SF, but definitely not these days), Ramen-Ya offers a nice alternative that's both different and not overly pricey.  The menu is interesting enough as well, offering a variety of ramen featuring different types of broths and topping combinations, as well as a mix of rice plates, appetizers, and small plates.  Sadly, I can't say the food was that remarkable, though.  -- MILK TEA...$5 (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramen-ya-las-vegas-5?select=vQUrKHgW-p5w5LiLSwKXDQ) The menu didn't list it, but I assume this was black tea.  I say \"assume\" because I could barely taste the tea.  It's not like it was overly creamy or sweet either.  Honestly, it just seemed like it was really watered down.  Save your money for the tables.  -- ONIGIRI & KARAAGE (Two Pieces)...$8 (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramen-ya-las-vegas-5?select=gNqUwhg3YTcbhjt7Yq6Gjg) Like with Jekyll and Hyde, one of these was good, the other was BAD.  For me, the Karaage was pretty decent - crisp batter, decent flavor, and somewhat moist.  The onigiri, however, was AWFUL.  Not sure what was worse - its ridiculously bland taste or its mealy/gross texture.  -- TONKOTSU RAMEN - Pork Chashu, Assorted Vegetables, and a Boiled Egg in Chicken and Pork Broth...$10.85 (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ramen-ya-las-vegas-5?select=mDUKUBa0j5lF4tptdh7wmw) It lists a \"chicken and pork broth\", but has Tonkotsu (read: pork broth) as an option.  Weird.  In any case, this was super disappointing.  While the noodles weren't bad, everything else missed - the broth was lackluster, the cabbage, bean sprouts, and spinach were out of place, the chashu wasn't warm (the fat was still congealed), and the egg was overcooked.  As far as service goes, it was fine - quick, efficient, and decently friendly.  However, as nice as the staff was, I can't say I appreciate how they apply a 16% tip to ALL parties, regardless of size (the menu only notes an 18% gratuity to groups of six or more).  Sure, I would've tipped at least that anyways, but it's both a bad look and dumb, since it caps off anyone who might have given more.  All in all, despite how great it is to now be able to get a hot bowl of ramen on The trip, you'd be better off leaving The Strip to try one of the many other ramen joints Vegas has to offer."}
{"text":"52° and spicy miso ramen goes so well together! This place is a gem hidden in The Grand Bazaar Shops outside of Bally's. The weather was perfect for a nice, hot bowl of Ramen and this place did not disappoint.  The Spicy Miso Ramen is able to hold its own against the Tonkotsu and Spicy Dipping Noodles that are staples in the Houston Ramen scene. Their broth is perfectly seasoned with just enough spice to not overpower the tastebuds. The Ramen literally melts in your mouth. The prices are fair and they give you a plentiful portion to fill your stomach and satisfy your cravings.  The staff was incredibly friendly and personable. In such a small space, the employees remain professional while maintaining a true \"Ramen restaurant\" nirvana feel. They do offer To-Go options to take back to your room, but I strongly recommend enjoying your Ramen at the bar for a true authentic experience, as Ramen is meant to be enjoyed immediately after preparation for the best result."}
{"text":"This place was okay. I don't know how else to describe it. I was not blown away in any shape or form. I got the karrage tonkatsu ramen. The chicken actually was pretty good even though by the time I received it the chicken was no longer crispy due to the soup. The broth was overly salty to my taste. I felt like I had to chug water as I ate it. I liked the noodles. They had a nice bounce and was probably the only saving grace. The egg is also hard boiled (overly done) and as a personal preference, I prefer it to be soft boiled but it was advertised as hard boiled.   I would probably skip, there are more yummy eats on the strip."}
{"text":"Surprisingly pretty tasty! Usually not a fan of ramen but since my hubby a big ramen fella , I decided to give them a try . Good service, hole in the wall, and pretty tasty! Bit pricey for ramen but let's not forget we're in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"good sushi burrito, the Las Vegas spicy tuna. good pot stickers, I liked the flavor and aroma. next time I'll try a ramen bowl. I'd definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"the best ramen so far in mtl the broth is AMAZING, this is one of the first place in mtl that is comparable to momofuku they also got great pork buns!"}
{"text":"They were fast, the service was good, and the staff was friendly and helpful. The soup was really good and a bowl was very filling for me. I had the fried chicken in miso soup. Yummy. Only gave it 4 stars because the menu was small. But what you get it good."}
{"text":"First time at this place. It is a very small location, only has about 10 seats I think. We had to wait for a few ppl to leave until we can sit down. I order the spicy ramen and it was really delicious. It was very flavorful and spicy for a cold night in Vegas."}
{"text":"I have had good and even amazing ramen so I know when something is just ok.  This place was just that, ok. Lacking flavor for my tastebuds."}
{"text":"Excellent little hole in the wall...and actually a little hard to find among all the other shops. Totally worth the stop for a delicious, inexpensive Japanese style ramen meal in Vegas."}
{"text":"A solid ramen place that's not the best ramen. It better than average. We tried the miso soup and gyoza(good but standard). The miso ramen with grilled chicken was very flavorful, the soft boiled eggs here are SPOT ON AND DELICIOUS, the noodles are good and as good as any other ramen spot.  The house special tonkatsu was good.  I like that the broth was not overly salty like at many ramen spots (and I like salt).  And the pork cheeks were a nice appetizer I'd recommend this place"}
{"text":"Awesome spicy miso! The Service was fantastic.  Koji took excellent call of us. There's nothing better than going to a ramen house run by Japanese people who really know their ramen! Domo arigato gozimasu Koji san!!"}
{"text":"OVERALL:   A small restaurant tucked within a plaza filled with  many other places to eat. Food is solid, being very affordable (especially in Las Vegas), generous portions, and super yummy. Food is not like OMG THIS IS THE BEST but more like MMM THIS IS YUMMY. Service was awesome though. The owner was so freaking nice.   DETAILS:   Inside: tiny! They have a small seating area in the left most area that fits about 10 people max. If you have a large group, I recommend you either eat outside or take it Togo.   - The food: Btw everyone, the menu is outdated. The prices have been raised so every thing is in the $9 range.   I ORDERED (1) Shoyu Ramen: broth was very flavorful: You can taste tones of miso, soy sauce, and sesame oil and they offered a lot of veggies (lettuce and bean sprouts). Only two slices of meat though, which is pretty typical of ramen but these slices were tiny. LMAOOO. Half of a boiled egg though I wish they were soft boiled.   (2) Katana Sushi Burrito: no nori to wrap the burritos in. They're actually wrapped in flour tortillas which made me crack up. Can't really go wrong with this, I really enjoyed it and it was a good size.   Service was bomb. The owner was the one serving us and he was so kind. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"After a night of drinking, my body was craving something spicy and comforting, and ramen sounded like the perfect remedy. Tucked away from the chaos of the strip, it's located in the alleyway in front of Starbucks by Bally's. When you walk in, it's small but quaint. I ordered the spicy miso ramen which came out to a little under $10 after tax which is not bad, considering Vegas prices. The seating was tight, but I didn't mind. When my ramen came out, the portions were HUGE! The noodles were stacked sky high and the broth was almost overflowing. It came with half an egg, chunks of fried vegetable tempura, and 3 pieces of chasu pork.   That first sip was just what I needed! The broth was spicy, flavorful, and hearty. The noodles were chewy and a good consistency. Overall, it was a filling and satisfying meal to start my day. I highly recommend it for those looking for an authentic Japanese ramen place away from the hustle and bustle that's not only affordable, but also delicious!"}
{"text":"Probably the most authentic Japanese experience I've had outside of living in Osaka, it was pretty much like stepping into a noodle shop along the Dotonbori.  My wife and I shared takoyaki, onigiri, miso karage ramen, and tonkatsu curry. The takoyaki is particular was awesome, I thought I'd never have good takoyaki in the US, and the tonkatsu curry was exactly like how it would be served in Japan.  Very good, and very filling."}
{"text":"This place is located in the Ballys shops. The place has has about 7-8 tables and minimal outdoor bar seating. The menu is a pretty good variety with ramen ranging from $10-$14 and various rice plates from $9-$14. Overall the quality was good and so was the service. Portions are a decent size as well. Check this place out if you're crazy Japanese food!"}
{"text":"Really tasty ramen ! Affordable prices but didn't give it 5 stars because it was extra oily/greasy. I got the tonkatsu"}
{"text":"Apres avoir cherche 30min pour un restaurant servent des soupes ramen vege, je suis tombe sur celui-la, qui est tout pres de mon travail. Ma fixation pour manger un Ramen n'a pas ete une deception en decident d'aller la bas! Super service, rapide et bonne atmosphere, je donne 4  en attendant d'y retourner pour y essayer d'autre plats!! Je recommande au vege la soupe Ramen legumes & champignons, un vrai delice!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite ramen restaurant in Montreal, simply because they offer a non-pork broth that is super delicious and lighter than your typical ramen.  All of their Izakaya options are super yummy as well!  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I must say that we were drawn to this place. First, it's dark and freezing outside. There is nothing that soothes the soul better than slurping on a hot bowl of ramen noodles. Second, the website looks terrific and finally it had good ratings on yelp.  First the positive points. This place is quite nice and cozy and the menu has a good selection of inexpensive items. We had a bowl of spicy miso ramen which had a nicely cooked egg.   However, as I was sitting by the bar, I knew the food was going to be subpar when I saw the cook put a frozen piece of katsu in the deep fryer. That katsu tasted like cardboard... Actually it was the same thickeness as a piece of cardboard now that I think about it! Throughout the night, I saw the cook handle various piece of frozen food like tempura. So I wouldn't be surprised if the noodles were packaged and the broth full of MSG. Only the okonomiyaki was ok although they were very cheap on the bonito flakes, mayo and teriyaki sauce. I thought the noodles and the broth were forgettable.   After a long walk to get to this place, we left the restaurant still a bit hungry and sorely disappointed... Never again!"}
{"text":"Uh eh I was a little disappointed with the ramen. The broth was very good and flavorful, but the rest of the ingredients just seemed so off to me. I got spicy miso which is my all time favorite and was very pleased with how tasty and spicy the broth was. However the pork chashu wasn't cooked right and the egg was literally a hard boiled egg.. not yolky or creamy at all. Which was so weird to me!"}
{"text":"Good and fast. I've had a little better, but not by much. The broth, egg, vegetables, and meats were all on point. The noodles were good but not freshly made. That's the only improvement I'd make. Worth a stop in."}
{"text":"Been to this place a couple times now.  They have expanded their place out quite a bit and can actually seat a decent amount of people now.  This place is a nice place to eat and it doesn't totally gouge your wallet.  So for a quick and easy bite to eat this is a good place to give it a go."}
{"text":"Went here as my husband and I was craving some noodles. Ramen was okay, broth was flavorful. Would of preferred my egg to be soft boiled rather than hard boiled.   I liked the idea of adding a mini curry bowl. Curry bowl was okay.   Nothing special, but would satisfy the craving if you wanted ramen."}
{"text":"Staying at Bally's for LVO (a tabletop gaming convention), and stopped into this tiny ramen house outside. Oh my goodness. I ordered a spicy beef miso it's amazing."}
{"text":"took a while, but ramen was flavorful enough for a place on the strip and had some rice with curry that was great"}
{"text":"little nook tucked away on the side of the strip next to Ballys, came here to eat on a recommendation from a nearby store worker. spicy miso ramen was meh, the pork chop fried rice was pretty bad. the pork chops you could taste weren't fresh and were soggy and then ramen broth was a little gummy almost. prices were relatively affordable in comparison to the rest of the strips prices, however. i would give this place a two star if it weren't for the incredible staff; they were so friendly (and some were actually japanese if that means anything) and constantly checked up on us in the little back bar-seat area (even though they're mostly a takeout place). they were all so kind and sweet and helped us decide what to order from the menu. if most of the sushi burritos were wrapped in seaweed/soy paper instead of a tortilla, i probably would have gotten those. not bad for quick and cheap lunch though."}
{"text":"4 stars.... 1.) It's such a little place...clauster phobic.. 2.) The food is awesome 3.) Service is awesome 4.) There's portion is good.. 5.) They take orders via tablets  It's weird though they got 2 kitchens...it's at each end of the restaurant. It's at the grand bazaar, South side... I ate mine so quick...the broth is just right..I ordered the spicy soup like $13 it's not bad since it came with gyoza, and chicken.. Didn't have seaweed though... I talked to the server..she isn't Japanese she was pretty straight forward I asked her lots of questions and she was patient. The chef is Japanese..the other servers are Japanese...therefore authentic Japanese..Oh they also have Bobatea...it's like bubble tea in Canada.. I didn't order it but my friend did and she loves it... It's a hidden gem I would say..if you want something local.."}
{"text":"I am surprised at the negative reviews. I ate here recently (when Vegas is uncrowded) and the service was very good. So was the ramen. Noodles cooked exactly right, flavorful beef pieces, and fresh vegetables. With all the crappy pizza, burgers, and so on, in LV, this place provides a tasty, quick, nutritious meal. There was no compulsory tip as another reviewer said. I would return."}
