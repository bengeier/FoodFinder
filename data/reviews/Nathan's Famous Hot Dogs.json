{"text":"We went here when it first opened, after receiving coupons in the mail.  The staff was very nice, but other than that I honestly can't say anything exciting about it.  My kids each had a hot dog, and hubby tried the chili dog and chili cheese fries.  I couldn't find anything on the menu that even remotely appealed to me, so I opted out.  If you like greasy, cheese smothered food then this is your place, but it's just not my thing.

 It is very overpriced for what you are getting... I can't even fathom paying more than $2 for a hot dog (we had coupons for 99 cent hot dogs).  For the amount of money we spent I would have much rather gone somewhere else with more variety."}
{"text":"Always hit this place for a hot dog when I'm downtown!  Great fried food. Fried Twinkies and Oreos are awesome."}
{"text":"We had the chicken strip meal, it was ok. Tasted like something you can cook at home. We might go back to try their $1.25 hot dog. Also, there is no place to sit, you have to stand to eat your meal."}
{"text":"Good food, but staff is HORRIBLE. Beyond rude and had the audacity to call my friend \"bougie\" because she requested her food a certain way. Sorry but if your staff has a poor attitude and you don't address it you deserve to close! 

Oh and to top it off the same lady who called my friend bougie stopped working to go get the security to tell him I was under age and I shouldn't be inside the casino. Hate to break it to you lady but I'm beyond 21 so keep trying to go out of your way to find something. 
Good luck trying to find a job."}
{"text":"Thought we'd try somewhere different tonight. What a horrible disappointment. Chili cheese fries were mushy, chicken strips had zero flavor and the seafood combo my husband had was inedible, frozen seafood, horribly overlooked and nothing had any taste in fact we're still not sure what one of the items on the plate was. Yuck! After that went to use the washroom, my advice just DON'T.  Holy horrific, dirty like you can't imagine. Made my skin crawl. I waited til we got to the mall."}
{"text":"Came in here to eat after some drinks. Overall it was OK, the deep fried Oreo was delicious! I also ordered the white castle sliders I wont ever order those AGAIN! Basically stuck in microwave they forgot about them and instead of giving me fresh ones they gave me hard as rock ones smh! The staff is ok not really friendly more like order and get out of the way lol might try it again next time i'm there."}
{"text":"The best thing going for a cheap junk food . You can get your Nathan's hot dog,fries chicken sliders,  chili,   Fried Twinkie & etc. They close @12 midnight"}
{"text":"enjoyed a fried twinkie although ive only been able to savor the taste of 1 i do at times miss our separation but u know they say you are what u eat . yet theres no bar at nathans it is located inside a casino so order a drink while in line to enjoy one of their  tasty fried snacks"}
{"text":"Always visit Nathan's at the Mermaid Casino at Fremont Street Las Vegas - you can't beat the prices and all the amazingly tasty fried food you can eat.  BUT...

Just learned that this place, plus other casinos nearby will be Closing June 27 - read the article of the coming changes for the area - sad day as another favorite place bits the dust due to progress..

{"text":"When you're enjoying the Freemont Experience, don't forget to stop by Mermaids Casino where you can enjoy a FRIED TWINKIE, or a FRIED OREO for about a buck at Nathan's! The other Nathan's in Vegas don't boast these popular treats, so make sure you go to the one at Mermaids on Freemont Street! 

I had the Fried Twinkie and it was absolutely satisfying! It was about a dollar, and was better than the ones you buy at the county fair for $9!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the bacon and cheese fries but the burgers are only meh, didn't even finish my double cheese burger. I like that they have the drive through so it adds to the list of quick drive through lunch places I can go to on my lunch break. But it seems like a premium price for what you get. I don't mind paying the premium if you get better the average fast food, but really the only benefit is the cool French fry toppings, and that its named after me. But with five guys, burgers and fries around, I think they need to step up the game somehow."}
{"text":"OMG I'm next in line to order and all the cooks walk out front to hug other guests! I left and went to Dupar's great service and great food. Really only wanted a couple of hot dogs."}
{"text":"This is a mixed review. I love these ridiculous hot dogs and equally absurd fried offerings (oreos, twinkies, and pb&j). I also love the show put on by the dog-barristas. I love the price($10 for 2 people).
The place itself is a hole; a dive; a dump. Be prepared to wipe down a table and to stand in a line filled with wobbling drunks."}
{"text":"Located inside the Mermaid Casino at the Fremont Street Experience, this place can easily be one of Downtown Las Vegas's best kept secrets. This place has been here forever yet this is only the second review to date.

For those that already know about this, when you make the trek to the Fremont Street Experience, as soon as you are anywhere near the Mermaid Casino, you will see big signs and banners of 99 cent Frozen Bananas, Deep Fried Twinkies and Oreos, and Hot Dogs. They have other options as well at reasonable prices but they purposely put out these specific pictures to draw people in and why not? 99 cents for the above mentioned items cant get any better than that. You folks that has been to Disneyland know that a frozen banana is now what, like 5 bucks? 

Just remember, this is located inside the casino so don't make the mistake of bringing your kids in there with you even though just getting food is your only reason, security will definitely kick you out. So have them wait outside with another parent or legal guardian while you get the goodies. Also they take CASH ONLY, so make sure you are ready. I think any ATM fees are worth the goodness you are about to scarf down.

As for their hours, on Fridays and Saturdays I think they close at either 11 or 12. Weekdays they close earlier. You would think they would be 24 hours since it is Vegas and all. 

Service is quite decent. You usually have at least 3 people working at all times. One to take your order, one to cook, and one to take your cash. On really busy nights expect the line to be pretty long. 

When you get your food, you can either stand at some of the chest high tables strewn about that's in front of the stand or just go outside and enjoy the sights as you eat. All the condiments you need are right there where you line up so no need to ask them.

On a side note, Hostess is no longer making twinkies but last time I was here, they still had some left so there's no guarantee they will still have some when you go there. That's ok though. You still have the other stuff. 

So any time you are in the area, make this as one of your stops for good but cheap food and don't forget to bring cash!"}
{"text":"A great, unassuming place for a late snack. Not a fancy place but that's what I expected, especially after I saw there were no seats. I can't penalize them for what they are. Some reviews called it a hole, well yes, it is, you go here after you've already had your fill of prime rib or a massive steak at the fancy restaurants at the strip. Hot dogs were s great as you would expect. Fries are piping hot and so good. The White Castle sliders are so-so, no different as what you will taste when you buy those multi-packs at Costco. Still, it was an experience, I am glad I did not stand in line too long here, and I avoided that White Castle line-hype at the strip."}
{"text":"I absolutely hate this place. Most definitely hands down the worst service I have ever had. They refused to serve us and asked that if we didn't leave they would call security! I waited in line for a half hour! All I wanted was a hot dog and they refused to make it. ALSO, more than half or their menu wasnt even available! Fuck the people that work there, I hope that their shit hole business down in the worst way. Places like this sure known how to ruin a Las Vegas experience."}
{"text":"MMMMMMMMM Deep Fries Oreos for a dollar!!!! Otherwise, the place itself is pretty gross (the dining area) and the staff isn't particularly kind. But whatever, it's in the Mermaids casino so it's not exactly like I was expecting the Ritz."}
{"text":"Get you're diabetic comatose fix here:
My husband and I went for fried Oreos (3); fried Twinkie (1); chocolate dipped banana each for .99Â¢. Our eyes were too big. And the fried Oreos are the winner. The chocolate covered banana comes in 2nd spot. My least favorite was the fried Twinkie, but that's just my personal preference. I won't post a pic because there's plenty out there of the experience!"}
{"text":"IF THERE'S A HOT DOG TO BE HAD, MY HUSBAND'S GOING TO HAVE IT

This Nathan's Hot Dogs is located within the Mermaid Casino on Fremont Street. This small casino sure can draw a crowd! The line in the back for food was crazy! Must be some good stuff .  Perhaps because a lot of fried options are also offered here. Nathan's was the long line and we decided not to wait in it on the first visit.

A couple of days later we were back for more gambling at the Mermaid and husband and I waited in a much shorter, but still good-sized line. 3 Hot Dogs for $3.21!  They were ready quickly and a small stand had mustard and katsup. The bread was pretty dry but the few bites of the h'dogs I had were pretty good. Hard to make a bad hot dog I guess. They weren't huge but were bigger than I expected for $1. 

Worth a stop in if you're hungry, as long as the line isn't too bad!"}
{"text":"Nightmare. Still puking. First the employees were rude. Actually first they got they got my order wrong LOL. The guy who screwed up my order ( brat, no bun, kraut, pickles) groaned and told someone else to do it. The female employee who took over the monumental task placed three pickle chips on my brat. I asked for more. She said it's would be an additional 81 cents. She then told me that I was going to charged for three toppings. Then she said, oh I forgot you have a brat. The kraut comes with. That truly upset her. She tried to shame me into the 81 cents. I said I just wanted the brat with as much kraut as I was allowed. She then snarled \"It's only 81 cents. What's wrong with you!\" \"I won't pay that for 3 pickle chips.\" She snarls back \"where are you from?\" I reply \"heaven, the opposite of you.\" 

My friend was embarrassed, kept telling me to just pay the 81 cents. I guess he did not realize that I was not expecting him to pay.  He got two hotdogs. I got another one for my husband. I had the brat with a *garnish of kraut. 

The hotdogs and the brat were close to raw. 

Sad, can't patronize them again... not even for deep fried deliciousness :

Zero stars"}
{"text":"The All-American hotdog is what you want to get. 

It's all you need. If you are insomuch as tempted by anything else, you are probably a freedom-hating commie! (And the staff will recognise it.)

This summer (2014), they went through a much needed renovation of the dining area; however, it is still located inside Mermaid's Casino, which is a smoky, dilapidated place of public accommodation. No, there is still no seating. (Eating while standing is not going to kill you [but those fried twinkies and oreos might.])

Yes, new and improved: they now even accept credit, debit, and charge cards! (They reluctantly stumbled their way into the twenty-first century.)

Have yourself a Nathan's FamousÂ® All-American for merely 1.25$ along with either a deep-fried TwinkieÂ® or OreosÂ® (an order is just three cookies) for 99Â¢.  There is no better deal under the canopy. (Spoilers: The cocktail shrimp for 99Â¢ es no mÃ¡s.) 

They also offer frozen White CastleÂ® burgers (I don't recommend) for 3.95$; other hot dogs (I don't recommend) for 3.25$-3.95$; chicken fingers (I don't recommend) for 3.95$; deep fried SmuckersÂ® (definitely do not recommend) for 2.25$ ; chocolate banana (don't recommend) for 99Â¢; and, a bunch of other shit like Red BaronÂ® pizza for 4.99$ that they will undoubtedly take their sweet, sweet time on getting prepared because they don't particularly enjoy serving freedom-hating commies."}
{"text":"Cheap and good! Helped end my Vegas trip on a high note. I had chicken sliders, french fries, and drink.  Plus shared deep fried twinkies and oreos. Wife ha d hot dog and fries. We spent less than $15. #goodstuff"}
{"text":"I only had the chocolate covered banana with nuts but I absolutely loved it! I saw a lot of people enjoying the fried twinkles and other goodies, not for me =)"}
{"text":"There are some harsh reviews for Nathan's but for as often as I eat hot dogs (basically never with the exception of camping), I thought what I ate was pretty decent.  Unfortunately, my spouse is practically a wiener connoisseur and as a result, he was less thrilled.  I was happy to pay $4.99 for a dressed up hot dog.  That's a major treat for me.  I tried the Southern BBQ Dog and really enjoyed it.  The pulled pork and bbq sauce was tasty and put me in the mood for the upcoming Stampede.  The fries with bacon and Ranch dressing tasted like a baked potato.  Again, I enjoyed it more than my spouse.  Whatever.  I'd go back if I was visiting Airdrie and had a coupon.  My favorite part was the atmosphere, to be honest.  I think the decor is really fun and I like the mural wall."}
{"text":"Just came to try the deep fried oreos.. they were good but the ppl who work here I guess are in a relationship and they were arguing that day and telling everyone in line their business, very unprofessional. .and one lady took her job way too serious and was loud,obnoxious and rude to her other Co worker. . Not necessary. . But like I said the oreos were good..typical fair food"}
{"text":"$1.50 hot dogs, $1 fried Twinkie, $1 fried Oreos, and $1 chocolate covered frozen bananas. This place is a cheap place to feed your drunk munchies. 

By the way, you need to be 21 years old to go inside the casino. That means you need to be 21 years old to buy the food."}
{"text":"Having never ever had a deep fried twinkie or any other sort of carnival confection of the sort, upon arriving to Fremont Street, we went off in search of a place that offered such crazy confections. Online searching let us know that Nathan's was one such place that carried deep fried twinkies as well as deep fried bananas! We headed over and got in a rather busy line but it moved pretty quickly. We ordered and a somewhat friendly set cooks and servers behind the counters took care of us. At one point, when I requested the deep fried banana, I was asked if I wanted a \"male or female banana\". This led to some confusion and I stood there unsure what to say. The guy asked pointd to my partner and said \"what does he have that you don't?\" I literally had no clue what to say that wouldn't come off really vulgar at the time, until the guy behind the counter laughed and said \"do you want nuts on the banana?\" and I burst out laughing! They were definitely a bunch that had fun with their jobs.

Our deep fried snack came to about $2.50 for both items. The twinkie came out hot and covered in icing sugar, while the banana was frozen with a layer of deep fried batter topped with nuts (we went with the \"male\" banana option). Both were extremely eye-crossingly sweet, but delicious. We couldn't finish what we had, since they were pretty hefty portions but since they were cheap, we didn't feel too bad with what was left over."}
