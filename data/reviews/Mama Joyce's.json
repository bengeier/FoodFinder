{"text":"Good frickn chicken. I'm from California and I was shocked. Never had chicken and waffles so good. The bomb that's all I can say. The chicken is flavorful, crunchy and moist and the syrup is unique. The staff is friendly. Definitely will be back in Cleveland and I will stop here"}
{"text":"$5 lunch menu is MONEY!! Some girlfriends and I enjoyed the most delicious chicken and waffles, seasoned fries, and fish sandwich before heading to Phoenix across the street to get some work done. I didn't care too much for the bread on my fish sandwich, but the well-seasoned fish fried to perfect more than made up for it. Next time I am craving cheap soul food, I know Mama Joyce's will be the first to cross my mind!"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to trying some mama Joyce after reading all the great reviews, but buyer beware, they do have some \"uh oh what did I order?\" dishes.  I had the fish and chips and I can not recommend it in any way, shape, or form.  It had fish skin, huh? yep, fish skin.  To be fair, I am not by any means a seafood lover, so maybe fried fish does come with skin. The fish flavor was unpleasant and the coleslaw wasn't tasty either.   My hubby had the chicken and fries.  The chicken was ok to pretty good, fries were ok too.  We won't be going back. And the worst part is, I'm still hungry :("}
{"text":"This place is a great neighborhood addition.  I split the chicken and waffle and the pork chop dinner with a friend.  The seasoning for the fried chicken and pork was fantastic.  It was reminiscent of KFC, but better, and of course, it's local.  I enjoyed most of the sides that we sampled, especially the collared greens.  It had a nice kick and little chunks of porky/hammy/goodness.  The mac and cheese wasn't anything special, but a little bit of hot sauce helped.  I'm no expert on yams, but they were a bit sweet for my liking.  All in all, I really liked this place.  I hope that more people will discover it.  It's in a location that has had a history of failed restaurants.  Hopefully Mama Joyce's can break the curse."}
{"text":"Soooooo, I'm on a diet.... Nothing serious, just five pounds.  But, let me tell you, I'm sure there is nothing, absolutely nothing here I can eat on the aforementioned diet.  Thus, I thought it would be a fabulous idea to order takeout for my boyfriend and go home and eat diet food....

We went here - the inside is an attractive orange, granite countertops and very clean.....  The food was prepared very quickly - we ordered catfish, yams and greens and cornbread.

Upon arriving home I opted to try my boyfriends takeout, and WOW!  it was fabulous.  Get your hands off my takeout fabulous.  My low cal rice and veggie stirfry was no longer attractive and he had to wrestle me for the takeout.  The yams were actually the best I've ever had, and the greens were not overboiled, and the catfish was perfectly fried.   Plus, nothing was at all greasy..... 

I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"Is this place really closed permanently ?  Where am I  going to  go get some fabulous  wings now???? Mama joyce  had the best !  And they had the best sauce  on the polish  boys ."}
{"text":"FOOD:
I have been meaning to try it hearing the good reviews and finally went when I had a craving for their chicken and waffles, I got immediately discouraged when their waffle-maker was broken. Instead, I went for the porkchop and fries which I think was average at best. My mac and cheese was very oily and looked like they simply reheated it in the microwave. I had ordered a side of extra sauce that they forgot to give me, but the bit that I did try on the rest of our food wasn't all that great anyways. 

ATMOSPHERE:
Small with only two sets of table and chairs, so mostly a take-out restaurant."}
{"text":"$5 wing special...need I say More?  Okay...i will.

A few items of note:
- There are like a total of 3 small tables in here, this is mostly a take-out spot
- They have no drinks of any kind!  Either bring your own or run down the street and grab one
- Get the \"special sauce\" on the side (I'll explain below)

Four whole friend wings plus a boatload of fries for five bucks.  You really can't go wrong.  I knew about the special sauce and the guy behind the counter asked if I wanted to try it before putting it on my food.  I declined and said I'd give it a go.  The cause is kind of a honey-mustard based concoction and is kept in a warmer and served that way.

So my comments above about sauce on the side?  Well, i like the unique flavor of the special sauce, but both the wings and fries were drenched in at, and everything lost their crispiness rather quickly.  I think next time I'd rather dip and pour at my own pace/choice then having everything swimming in the sauce to start.

All of the flavors were rock solid, and I will return."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for two weeks for work and one night I was looking for some comfort food after growing tired of eating out in the typical restaurants. So I got on yelp found this place and decided to check it out. I ended up ordering a large tilapia dinner for $11.00 which comes with 3 pieces of tilapia, fries and cole slaw. Everything tasted freshly fried, was seasoned very well and was delicious. They even have a special sauce which I was reluctant to try but the two employees there insisted that I take some and I was glad I did. The sauce was delicious on the fish and fries; I didn't even need the ketchup and hot sauce. The cole slaw was nothing to write home about but still good. I would definitely come back to this place and am even considering going back before I leave."}
{"text":"I got the chicken and waffles. It's was 6 dollars but worth it because it comes with 5 wings!! Tasted great, the waffles have cinnamon in them and were moist. Make sure you eat the waffle quick!ok service. Small establishment for quick meal pick up and an awkward encounter with the cashier. If your ever in \"The Heights\" around lunch come pick up this special, they always have it! Gave it a three because the waffle could be thicker and get hard if not eaten quickly."}
{"text":"Where else can you get chicken and waffles or a humongo fish sandwich for 5 dollars? I wouldn't say any (at least here in Cleveland). 

The chicken wings were so tender and the flavor was exactly how I dreamed it would be. Its got a kick to it for sure. The fish was perfectly battered and fried. On a five dollar sandwich, I thought maybe we'd only get one piece of fish, but there was at least 5 pieces of delicious fish! 

The storefront was a little shabby and standing at the counter, you don't expect much from the little kitchen. But oh boy, when that kitchen gets going and you get the first whiff of the food, you will surely be as amazed as I was. 

I'll definitely be coming back here time and time again. I'm drooling now thinking about the food!"}
{"text":"So good.

I came just at closing time to pick up some fried chicken for my husband. They were about to turn me away but then had pity on me since it was raining out. Maybe also because I share the restaurant's namesake. In any case, they were really nice to let me order still.

It's a small take out joint. Very affordable and easy to order. I ordered 5 wings (for $5) with honey mustard BBQ sauce. They ran out of fries, but I think it usually comes with fries too. 

Luckily, they had just fried up their previous order and had a few left for me! 

I told them I'd be back when it was more open. The husband loves this place. I don't really eat meat much anymore but the smell of this fried chicken is my weakness. 

Mmm."}
{"text":"Don't let the store front and interior of the store fool ya, the food here is amazing! 

I ordered the chicken and waffles and my friend got the fish filet sandwich, both for only $5! It took a while for the food to come out, but we didn't mind. My first bite into the fried chicken was magical :) The crispy shell of the chicken is just sooo perfect-- not to thick and not too thin. The spices on it was so simple, but sooooo delicious. The waffles were very soft. My friend's fish filet sandwich was also very yummy. The portion size for both dishes was super generous! 

I definitely recommend trying both items out! I look forward to coming back here and trying out their $5 wings :)"}
{"text":"Soul food take out restaurant with maybe 4 tables.  It's outstanding. Homemade sauces. Always fresh product. Fish taste like it just jumped out of the water. Always fresh  cooking oil. Carnivores:best Polish Boys and wings. Fries cooked to perfection, like an art form, perfectly salted."}
{"text":"My friends and I have become huge fans of the fried fish sandwich and the chicken and waffles. The food is fairly priced, tastes fantastic, and clearly prepared with care. It is a family operation and that is evident when you visit there. They have 3 small tables in a tiny dining area, we've never ate at the restaurant and always choose to order take out. The serving sizes are adequate, and the food is always warm. They are cash only so be aware of this before ordering. 

Chicken and waffles are ~5 wings that are breaded and deep fried, along with a nice waffle with just the right amount of crisp. You get a small cup of maple syrup, not the best quality but good enough and whatever sauce you requested for the wings. I am a huge fan of their special sauce and would recommend it to anyone. Definitely worth another visit."}
{"text":"This is a small family run place. The menu is scribbled on a chalkboard above the counter. Looks can be deceiving though because these are the best wings in Cleveland. The sauce that comes with the wings is amazing. I brought these home to my princess wife who has very particular tastes and she loved them too. These wings are now a weekly staple in our house. We are all on a no carb diet but make the sacrifice for the breaded whole wings every week. You're going to have to wait for your food at least 20 minutes because they make sure the chicken is done right. I can't wait to start trying other menu items but the wings are so good I don't want to order anything else when I'm standing at the counter. In case you think I'm blowing smoke.... Lemme tell you I'm a chef and my executive chef at work is the one that turned me onto this place. His fried chicken is awesome and makes you think you're down south. Mama Joyce will not disappoint you with their food. In the end the food is all that matters."}
{"text":"Pretty much a carry out place. Three small tables mainly used to wait. Got chicken and waffles and a bunch of sides - sides are all à la carte.
Waffles are soft but good, the maple syrup was not very sweet, luckily I had some good syrup at home to substitute. Chicken wings were fabulous and Mac and cheese was very good (don't expect creamy, it's dry but really delicious) 

I'd carry out again with a specification of cooking the waffles a bit more & picking up my own syrup."}
{"text":"I'd give 3 and a half stars if it was an option. Worst part of the experience was the wait. I understand that chicken takes a while to cook but these are wings, not very big.

But the food is great. I actually really like the special sauce, definitely more complex than HSW. Wings and fries were good especially smothered in the special sauce ($5), waffle was nice and thick ($5 with wings, $0.50 for extra sauce on the side). Greens were a little overcooked but at least I got my veggies in. 

Next time I want to try the fried whiting sandwich ($5), Mac ($3),   and cornbread ($0.50). Definitely calling ahead of time (like 20 minutes beforehand!!) before getting there"}
{"text":"Always a great experience here. The staff is great and the food is made to order. Sometimes things take a while to cook and they are often out of certain menu items, but they'll always recommend a good substitution. I like to order the wing combo and take it across the street to the Wine Spot to enjoy with a glass of wine."}
{"text":"Mama Joyce's is the epitome of a soul food takeout place.  It's so small that you'll miss it if you don't know it's there, but very much worth taking the time to spot.  

For me, the acid test of soul food is the macaroni and cheese, and Mama Joyce's is excellent - like, I ate all mine and wanted to steal my husband's excellent.  The yams are also outstanding: sweet with just the tiniest bite of spice to really make the flavor zing.  The fried chicken was nothing particularly special, but competent, and the waffles for chicken and waffles light and fluffy.  Everything is prepared on-site and very fresh.  There are a few chairs to wait for takeout, but if it's a nice day the neighborhood is perfect for a stroll for the 10 or 15 minutes you'll have to wait (a bit longer if you order the dark meat chicken dinner as they fry the chicken at the time of order, which I consider a very good thing).

This is fine comfort food in a neighborhood full of excellent eating.  A great addition!"}
{"text":"I am by no means an expert on Soul Food, however I know one thing and that is good food...Mama Joyce's knows what's up.  This was my first time here so I ordered what everyone else ordered on Yelp... the $5 Wing Special-4 wings and fries plus a side of their Greens. I was pleased to see that the wings were whole....those are my favorite =) The best part about the chicken wing was the light and crispy breading surrounding it.  It was more perfect than finding a $20 bill on the ground (this never happened to me but it sounds freakin amazing).  The second best part about the wing was the signature sauce that I got on the side....don't forget about it you will regret it for the rest of your life.  The greens were amazing as well, very flavorful and I loved the generous bits of pork...it pretty much melted in my mouth.  I really don't have one bad thing to say about this place.  The wait was about 20 minutes, however I didn't see it as a bad thing because it just gave me an excuse to enjoy a beer at one of the many drinking establishments nearby =)"}
{"text":"I read all the yelp reviews about this place and thought I'd give it a try. Was a bit hesitant because of how they looked from the outside but finally braved up to go in. 

Staff was very friendly; prices were extremely affordable. The wait was long for the food and there was a moment I was thinking \"the food better be good,\" but when I dived into it, it was AMAZING!!! I ordered the $5 wings special (4 fried chickens with fries) with their special sauce. Don't know what's in the sauce but I'm sooo glad I got it. It wouldn't be the same. 

I'll definitely be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"The chicken was great. I had the chicken with their special sauce. The staff is really nice and I'll definitely be back. Thanks MAMA JOYCE."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for fried chicken that is closer to my house than Sharks. Stopped in here one day to give it a try. I was impressed that they make the chicken fresh (it sort of takes a long time, though). But it was worth the wait. I'm adding Mama Joyce to my list!"}
{"text":"I was originally going to go to another soul food place until I found out they do not have po' boys. Um, ex-squeeze me???

So by chance, we saw Mama Joyce's and stopped in.

Ordered the pork po' boy and mac n cheese.

The po' boy was slammin. Very sloppy and messy but indeed delish. The sauce is tangy, sweet with a hint of kick (heat) to it. The slaw was yummy as well.

*Sigh* I think I will forever be on a quest to find the perfect mac n cheese (aside from my own, of course). They gave me a nice amount and it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't \"omg yassss\" and I've been searching for that for years. Ho Hum.

Still, at $6, I'm pleased. It hit the spot, it was good and they were quick with my order.

Like Arnold Schwarzenegger. - \"I'll be bock\"."}
{"text":"My husband and I got takeout from Mama Joyce the other night as I forgot (again) to take some freaking meat out of the freezer the night before and we had no food in the house. (worst wife ever award 2 years running). 

Anyhow, we only live a block away from MJ and had always been meaning to give it a shot. Sean got chicken and waffles and I had the fried chicken dinner with mac and cheese and slaw. 

The sides leave a lot to be desired, at least the ones I had. Again, I continue on my quest for actual good mac and cheese in the Cleve (see also Hoggy's review). Soggy, not yummy noodles with semi-melted/recongeled cheese. The cole slaw was passable but creamier than I like it. If judged by the sides alone, I'd go with 3 maybe even 2 stars. 

But the fried chicken.....o gawddd, the chicken. Really well done, crispy fried chicken with the best seasoning! I am one of those people who doesn't really eat the chicken skin and everybody is yelling at me that 'it's the best part'. But even I had to nibble on this yummy, crispy goodness.

Get the chicken, skip the mac and slaw."}
{"text":"Dark meat chicken and waffles? Waffle was rubbery.  chicken was scrawny. New heights grill has better chicken and waffles. Rib cage better everything else."}
{"text":"Pretty impressed!

After looking everywhere on Lee Road to grab a late night dinner (10pm), we were about to give up until we saw Mama Joyce.

It looked busy - so we stopped in. They were quick on our order- only took about ten minutes to cook. They said our name and we sat down in their small seating area. 

For 5 dollars each, we got super solid and filling meals. He got the fish sandwich - a huge stuffed fish sandwich came out accompanied by seasoned fries. A very tasty sandwich. I got the chicken and waffles- wow, their chicken was great! It was lightly breaded with great seasoning- not too salt and not too fried- just right. The waffle was ok- just a typical waffle, but wow, definitely go for the chicken! 


We were stuffed and satisfied. If you're ever in the Lee Road area and want something quick, cheap, and satisfying (and of high quality), make sure you stop in Mama Joyce!"}
{"text":"Had gone to a luncheon, was served 4 small pieces of lettuce one tomatoes cherry, a 2in dry piece of chicken! Was stared. Called Mama Joyce's got the wing special ! Oh happy day. The chicken was supurb, the sauce was different and I liked it got a side of Mac and cheese fantastic. I am going again today"}
{"text":"I went here with some friends to grab some take out.  I ordered the chicken & waffles and got collards greens and mac & cheese.  The fried chicken was definitely some of the best I've had ever, a nice spice, a good size and cooked perfectly.  Overall this combo was great and I really like the greens, spicy with red pepper flakes and bits of smoked ham.  My friends enjoyed their food too, they had the pork dinner and the big fella burger.  Would defnitely go back.  It took about 20 minutes for them to make up all of our food, which was a pretty big order.  The pricing is good and the service was excellent.  The place is very clean but only has a couple of tables if you want to eat in."}
{"text":"I had the chicken and waffles. It was only $5 or so which was nice. A side of mac and cheese was like $3 or something. The chicken and waffles were pretty good for the price. If I lived around here, I would eat here more often."}
{"text":"Whenever I go to Mama Joyce's I always get the chicken Mac and cheese and yams! Hands down the best soul food I Had had in Cleveland. I will always come back here for some good comfort food!  The chicken seasoning is very addicting!!

Updating because Mama Joyce's is still some really good food...when they have food. They've been out of sides lately for the past several months. Also the last couple of time I ordered Macaroni it was on the crispy crunchy side. I love them though and can't seem to let them go but trust me when I say I'm a little tired of hearing \"We only have greens left\" I love y'all though."}
{"text":"One of the best spots in the neighborhood. The place is fairly small but clean. The service is decent, and the food is excellent. I love the flavor of the wings and omg, The sauce!! When I go I usually go I get the wing special or dinner. The dinner you get 2 sides. I go with The Mac and pinto beans. Yum!! Im getting hungry just talking about it!! Oh, the prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, I didn't have to wait long, I went there on a Thursday evening. They have the best tasting greens I have ever had. Chicken wings were fried to perfection. Definitely will return!"}
