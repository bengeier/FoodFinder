{"text":"This little owner operated shop shares the same space with a Subway.  I ordered the breakfast special that included an egg and ham on toasted bagel and a medium coffee.  The bagel was made to order.  It tasted average.  The coffee was surprisingly decent.  The counter area was really messy and could use some cleaning.  The lady behind the counter was friendly.  It is not easy to spot Honeybee on the street.  It is located in the same mall as Kitchen M and Subway."}
{"text":"I was looking for a little place to have breakfast and a coffee early on Sunday that was not Tim Hortons, and was close to the mall. Well, Honeybee came up on the search, so Honeybee it was.  This location is also a Subway, and looks to be owner operated. I like that! There was a nice selection of breakfast sandwiches and omelettes, and after much debate, I got the twister bagel with cream cheese and a coffee. Loved the cream cheese (like deli cream cheese instead of Philadelphia) and the bagel was massive! Best of all, the coffee was GREAT! Tim who? Ha. I really liked this little spot -and while there wasn't much of a donut selection, I know I will be coming back regularly to my new little coffee shop. Hopefully there will be more donuts next time. :) The women behind the counter were so wonderful and friendly, too. All around, this spot was a great find!"}
{"text":"I love the deluxe breakfast sandwhich on a big twister bagel. I get mine with ham, my boyfriend gets his with bacon.  Candy, who is the server we see most is so friendly and makes us feel extremely welcome every time we come in. Also, if you see the white box of donuts sitting on their counter get one. They are fresh and delicious. My go to is the maple dipped and the bf adores the apple fritters"}
