{"text":"Most authentic Indian food I've had in the U.S. I've traveled the world solely to try different foods. And this place deserves the credit it deserves. Sadly, I would say that most people would prefer an Americanized version of Indian food and not understand what a privellege that this gem of a restaurant is here in Wisconsin. The other Indian places in the city have compromised for the mass demographic. I guess it's good business on their part. But if you want to experience the finest most authentic version that Indian cuisine has to offer, this place is hands down in a league of its own."}
{"text":"LOVE IT :) . I have been to a lot of indian restaurants in madison, BUT after I went to Haldi Masala nothing comes close to their taste and spice levels.

In two words :TRY IT."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant! Extremely enjoyed their beef masala. Can not live without this restaurant."}
{"text":"The buffet is quite good and original, but we  went for dinner and discovered that the dishes on the menu are even better. The food is wonderfully varied, with really interesting and unusual flavors, and many options that are relatively light/healthy."}
{"text":"Had the food twice now .. the food is Authentic and spicy like it should be.. so far based on what we have tried must recommend the chicken 65, Hyd Tawa machi, chicken 555,  chicken chettinad  .. try it with a chilled kingfisher beer. Recommend it highly if you need to try authentic Indian food .."}
{"text":"WATCH OUT FOR BONES & GRISTLE, especially at lunch.  I have eaten here twice: once as a dine-in dinner guest, and once as a lunchtime delivery.  When I dined in for dinner, my Chicken Tikka Masala was great! I loved how it was more flavorful that other Indian restaurants in the area.  Our table had Samosas, Naan, and Butter Chicken as well and all were perfect and well spiced!  However, today at lunch, the Chicken Tikka Masala I received looked different.  Instead of the normal sized chicken pieces, it was small, tortured, shredded chicken thigh pieces that included pieces of sharp bone, hard gristle, and strips of skin.  I've never seen anything like it from any Indian restaurant I have been to.  It was inedible.  I felt it was dangerous to be serving sharp bone fragments in something that is covered in a thick sauce and meant to be eaten without picking through it; Someone could choke or cut the inside of their throat on it.  I called to let them know and they apologized but didn't seem to have an explanation.  I wonder if they don't save their less desirable chicken scraps to put out in the lunch buffet, and that is what I got sent because I ordered at that time of day.  I'm super surprised and disappointed, but I have to say I would be very very wary of their food until I knew the problem has been resolved."}
{"text":"Pretty near the perfect biryani. Being on a vacation to Wisconsin I hardly expected to eat at an Indian place but an honest mistake lead us here, and boy Haldi turned out to be a big surprise!!!. We tried the Hyderabadi dum biryani and it was one of the best and mind you, I have tasted biryani even in India. If you are around the Madison area, this is a must Visit to taste good food moreover authentic Indian."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed by Kangchen, so when Haldi opened in the same spot, I didn't expect it to be so different, but it's quickly become my favorite Indian restaurant in town. The food is a cut above anywhere else--each dish has a distinct, complex flavor profile. The little things like chai and chutneys are made in-house and it shows. When I've been there, the staff have been nice, and the service has been timely."}
{"text":"Excellent experience. We had tried a few other Indian restaurants around the area. While others were good in their respects, but from food to service, Haldi was above all. 

I would recommend tandoori chicken, fried rise, samosas, veg Manchurian."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Chicken dum Biryani and Chettinad chicken was great. Service was good. 
Garlic Naan and Paneer Kulcha was too good. 
I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Solid food, reasonable prices for it. It doesn't allow for spice customization, but it's tasty and it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great variety. Authentic spices and sice levels. Everyone was kind and attentive- no empty water glasses which is amazing. Check it out! Highly recommend!!! Try the lunch buffet to try a little of everything."}
{"text":"V nice South Indian food.  Biryani was great."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from here at like 9PM, so I didn't get a chance to really sit down and check out the environment.  But I think the food speaks for itself.  I ordered the butter chicken, and it was fantastic.  I ordered spicy and it actually turned out to be spicy.  The flavor was great, and they gave just enough rice for the sauce (such that I didn't have any leftover rice with no sauce and curry to eat it with).  The chicken was cooked super well and very tender.  I will definitely come back to try their other varieties."}
{"text":"I have tried Goat, Chicken chettinad and their dum biryani. All were authentic and delicious. Better than the place that was there before Haldi Masala. Worth a try."}
{"text":"Exceptionally  authentic tasting  south indian  food. Owner is really nice and considerate of any concerns. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Hello Raja, I did bring this issue up to the attention of your staff. Instead of fixing it, they stood on the corner and kept laughing as if nothing was wrong at all. How do you explain this now?"}
{"text":"We got takeout last night, and were so pleased with the flavor and quality of the food. We sat there alternating between curries, trying to decide which was more delicious. The garlic naan was also heavenly. This will be our go-to Indian place on the West side."}
{"text":"Very good south Indian food. My favorites were Onion Mirchi Bajji, and Gutti Vankaaya Curry. Also enjoyed the masala tea after lunch."}
{"text":"I am Indian and this is the best Indian food I've had in Madison by far. Great selection of South Indian dishes from various states that are all really well prepared, which has been almost impossible to find at other Indian restaurants in the area. We tried the following dishes on our first visit, and all were really tasty: sambar vada (wasn't on the menu), chicken chettinadu, dosa, Gobi Manchurian, Malabar Parotta. Really kind and attentive staff as well. This is my new go to Indian spot in Madison and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This food is amazing! We're still talking about it a couple weeks after. 

The atmosphere isn't anything special, \"no frills\" if you're a glass half-full person, but you're there for the food. We were there on a Tuesday night for dinner. Service was friendly and attentive, had a few different dishes and everyone was satisfied. 

The only negative was they weren't able to split the bill on two different cards. If that's your plan going in, let the waitstaff know before hand and you'll avoid that problem."}
{"text":"First time trying this place, great customer service! did not have to ask for water once. The food was excellent, ordered the potato paper masala and my husband had the chicken tikka masala. The appetizer was gobi manchuri, which was delicious. Definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Went to the best new (4mo)Indian resturant last night. Incredible menu and if you are Vegan or vegatarian they have a HUGE selection.  Spicy, flavorful and well presented. Mom and Pop shop, young couple. I have been to many Indian resturants and the food here was one of the best. I think they have buffet style at lunch . The prices  are very reasonable. We need to support a fine restuant like this, the previous Indian resturant in the same spot did not make it but the food was not as good. I give this 5 stars.
 Haldi Masala 7475 mineral  point rd  next to Pier one on mineral point rd. Go and enjoy. We took our grandson for his 21st birthday and he loved it. Authentic is the best word for it. The only negative is trying to figure out what to order there are so many wonderful things. We will have to go back. No choice."}
{"text":"We were going to a movie at the Marcus Point Theater and decided to try Haldi Masala for dinner first since it was nearby.  What a great decision!

We arrived a little before 6:00 pm on Tuesday. The restaurant was nearly empty.  We were seated promptly and brought water and menus. I don't usually struggle with what to eat, but this time I was having a hard time deciding. Our waitress asked a few questions about what types of food we like and the spiciness level and then made some recommendations. We had the Gobi Manchurian. This was battered cauliflower with garlic, ginger and onion. The batter reminded me of a tempura. I would never have guessed it was cauliflower, the texture was more like pork.  The flavors were dynamite. This was an excellent recommendation. We also had the garlic naan. Garlicky, buttery, crispy, this was some of the best naan I've eaten. For entrees we had the gongura mamsam which was a goat in a curry sauce. The goat was tender and tasty and the sauce was spicy and delicious. She had asked how spicy and I like it and she came back to check and it was perfect. I was a little bummed that there were bones in the goat but it was very tasty. My partner had the baingan bartha which is an eggplant dish with tomatoes, peas, onions, and spices. I'm not much of an eggplant fan, so this was not my favorite dish, but my partner said he enjoyed the flavors.

Our waitress was prompt, friendly, had good recommendations, was great about refilling water, and was generally just exceptional. The place did begin to fill up while were dining. I enjoyed the Indian music videos on the TV in the background. I would definitely return to Haldi Masala and I'd really like to try their lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Must visit Indian restaurant!!!!! This is my second time here and by far the best service we have ever received in an Indian restaurant in Madison. The food was much better this time as well. 

We tried the masala fish for appetizer which was delightful. We had masala dosa and an egg dosa as well.  The dosas were crispy and fresh. Sambhar and the coconut chutney that came with it were very good as well. 

This will be my new go to place for Indian food!!!!"}
{"text":"Service is a little pokey at getting back to the table, BUT this is a family running the place, and they have lots of tables to get to at times. They are very friendly, and our order (8 people) was 100% accurate and the food came out quickly once ordered, and at the perfect temperatures, etc. Okay... so the food. THE FOOD. This is why you come here! I ordered the Gobi Manchurian for an appetizer, and I haven't had that prepared deliciously anywhere else. I ordered the stuffed eggplant for my entree, and it was also very good. Everyone at my table ordered different entrees, and I love but they all came in similar family style bowls. it gave the whole meal a shared experience for everyone. Next time I can't wait to try the gigantic dosas that swept past our table for other customers. I eat vegan, and I am not accustomed to having so many decisions to make. ;) I will be back to try everything that I was torn over... My one disappointment was that I was told none of the desserts can be made or ordered without dairy. Vegans love fried dough, syrup and spiced nuts too! Just sayin'. 

I brought in a coupon and my husband and I ate like crazy for $35 after the tip (we didn't have alcohol though.) I recommend this place whole-heartedly and I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Excellent and authentic Indian food. Very friendly and helpful owner and staff. 
A bit on the greasy side. 
Lots of delicious and unusual southern Indian items. We tried an Andhra biryani with lentils and chicken in it. Very refreshing. Large portions enough for 2-3. Their Dosas, idlies and vadas are excellent. Some of us ordered from the Indo-Chinese menu - very underwhelming and bland. Will avoid it next visit. All in all - one of the better Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"The food was great! We all tried different items and each was wonderful! Staff was very friendly and helpful. The decor definitely needs work. The kitchens timing could also use a bit of tightening as my meal came out much after the other three, but we all still left happy!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Indian buffet. While it's not as extensive as other buffets, the dishes provided are more than enough to get full on. I prefer the smaller selection and it's not as overwhelming. 
My favorites are the variety of biryanis, usually 2-3 to choose from and the andhra-style egg curry! I love it for its spiciness, familiarity and that home cooked touch. 
The staff is very attentive and most of the times, we are  asked how the food is and if we were ok with the spiciness. Bring it on! We usually go on Fridays as the variety of dishes is taken up a notch, with variety of dishes made of fish, goat or lamb. There's usually a buttermilk drink, tea, and smoothie concoctions available in small cups as part of the Friday buffet too. The buffet price goes up but well worth it. 
This is located in the High Point Center, near West Towne Mall along Mineral Point & D'onofrio Dr."}
{"text":"We just had an excellent dinner here. The staff was wonderful and helped us decide on a couple of dishes. Our waiter also helped explain some of the regional differences in Indian food. The tandoori roti and the samosas had a really nice flake to them. I really enjoyed my chicken tikka masala, which had a little bit more of a creamy, milky taste than I am used to. The goan coconut vegetable curry was really hearty and had a great curry leaf flavor.

This place should definitely be more crowded. Looking forward to trying their lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  This place deserves your support."}
{"text":"Honestly, I was a bit disappointed by the food selections upon initial inspection but warmed up to them. I looked at other reviews on here and realized that it was southern, not northern indian cuisine which I was unaware of. I liked the spiciness of the food and the naan bread was wonderful. My favorite was the cauliflower dish(cannot remember the exact name.) The only thing I would add is to goto the buffet earlier - towards the end, it seemed like it was pretty picked over(like the dish with paneer cheese had none except sauce). The bathrooms themselves seemed disorganized with paper products running out and in random locations. It's definitely somewhere I'm going to try again. It isn't as big of a buffet as other places but the price was right."}
{"text":"Is it tacky to leave two update reviews? I don't care.

I tend to be on the generous side when giving 5 stars. If everything is delicious and I have no real reservations about a place, I'm happy to give 5 stars. Tonight was on another level. It's only the second time in my life that I've experienced a meal that I can only describe as a religious experience.

I've had the tandoori chicken before as part of the buffet, and I thought it was surprisingly good. That's why I ordered it again tonight. I was told it would take awhile to prepare. I passed the time eating some naan and watching Krishnav, the owners' toddler, run around with a balloon.

Then the tandoori chicken came, steam rising in a plume above the pan, juices sizzling as the hostess set it down on my table saying, \"Be careful. It's hot.\"

I took one drumstick onto my plate. Then, thinking that the dish was rather visually impressive, I put the drumstick back and snapped a picture.

At last, I gingerly took a bite. I was immediately struck by how good it tasted. And it was juicy, too--juicy and tender in that way that only piping hot fresh food can be. The edges were lightly charred, smoky and crunchy. The moisture still rising from the chicken carried its aroma richly through my mouth and nose. Each bite clarified to me that it was a perfect aroma, with spices balanced in perfect harmony, balanced so perfectly that it is difficult even now for me to isolate any individual ingredient or element of its flavor.

After I finished my five pieces of chicken, I sat there with a stupid open-mouthed smile, taking in the residual scent of the juices left among the vegetables on the plate. I felt completely and utterly happy. I was so happy to exist in this world at the same place and time as Haldi Masala.

I had dessert, because I needed to step down gently from that meal. The Rasmalai was pretty good. It was clean and light, food I'd be perfectly content giving 5 stars, like most of the menu here.

I drove home. Traffic was busy for 6 PM on Saturday. Bjork's break-up album, Vulnicura, was in my CD player. I hummed along to depressing lines like \"You have nothing to give / Your heart is hollow / I'm drowned in sorrows / No hope in sight of ever recover / Eternal pain and horrors.\" I was smiling. And I was completely happy."}
{"text":"I was just stopping by Madison after a weekend trip to Devil's Lake, and had a taste for Indian food. Glad we tried Haldi masala! The food was great, pleasantly spicy, and reasonably priced. We had tea, which is served with milk, I'd recommend it sweetened. Best dish at the table was Butter Chicken. If I did it again, I'd avoid the goat, as it was a little bone-y."}
{"text":"we would like to recommend the Indian food lover not to order food from Haldi for any events or parties. Yesterday we ordered food from Haldi for my friend's send off party. Haldi send the food by mixing three different types of chicken left overs from the previous days buffets. Biryani was not a biryani. It was mixture of butter and heavy masala. Indian restaurant owners should not take Indian customers for granted."}
{"text":"Wow - this place is great!  We had a really nice dining experience going in for lunch last week - they do a lunch hour buffet and there were a ton of nice options to choose from....so much so that there was no way I could try them all!  The wait staff was super friendly and kept a very close eye on everyone - my water was generously filled over and over, and they actually ask if you want 'ice' or 'regular' water (thank you, I hate cold water!).  I honestly thought the food would have a little bit more heat than it did with some of the dishes. Our server noted (without prompting) that they had a big business reservation that day so they had to dial back the heat a bit, so I'm very excited to go back and try their dishes again when everything is being served up with their regular spice level!  We will definitely check them out again."}
{"text":"I've been to Haldi Masala twice for their lunch buffet and occasionally have the craving to visit them again. I'll be there one day soon! 

I really like the food here. There's not a huge variety of dishes compared to other Indian buffets and the dishes felt more \"homestyle\". But apart from the more common tikka masala type dishes, they have more unusual dishes (to me) like egg bhurji. I wish I had taken better note of the names because there were several other dishes that I really liked but had not tried before. The second time I visited, they even had a crab dish which was so sweet and yummy! 

Service was good too- nothing fancy about this restaurant, but it is clean, bright, and welcoming."}
{"text":"We decided to try out this place for lunch buffet. For $13 per person it felt like highway robbery. 

Negatives:
1. There wasn't much variety in food. Really slim pickings if you are vegetarian. 
2. The food in itself didn't taste that great. It wasn't bad. It was just OK. 
3. The gulab jamun was soaked in the liquid for way too long it was mush. 

Positives:
They have coloring stuff for kids to be entertained. 

I wish they charged two rates: one for vegetarian buffet and another for the non-vegetarian buffet. $13 per person felt a lot for lunch when the buffet had nothing worth mentioning."}
{"text":"Good food! Diverse menu. We ordered Gobi Manchurian and it was really good and spicy. I had the hakka noodles which were good but could have brought side of soy sauce or other Chinese sauces to make less dry. Husband ordered Mysore Dosa and that was very good and even little Sarina had some. Family friendly!
Service was friendly, and kept refilling water. I do wish they were a little less quick to pick up plates which made it feel a bit rushed."}
{"text":"Crabs Curry for Weekend Lunch buffet! None of Indian buffet (None in NYC, none in NJ, none in CA)  had dared to provide such exquisite seafood variety in the buffet (not to forget Shrimp Masala, Pomfret Curry). This is absolute feast for seafood lovers...

For Chicken or Goat meat lovers, there were 2 types of biryanis, and meat balls along w/ tandoori. 

For veggies lovers, lot of combinations from Southern and Northern cuisine. Surprisingly, in this Southern style (Idali, Sambar, Vada) restaurant, the northern style dishes (Saag, Butter Paneer, Dum Aaloo) were also authentic. 

The desert section has limited options here, but that were still enough to stand out from routine options: Mango ice cream, Gulab Jamun, and Rice Kheer - that you may get at any typical Indian restaurants. 

The spice level reminds the homestyle meals, and the preparations are not oily.... And if one's palate needs some help to deal w/ hot food - have a glass of buttermilk on the side. 

The owner and staff seems very attentive. The Naans were being served hot right on table. The glasses were refilled without being asked. Even though we stayed beyond the closing time (3pm), we were asked if we need anything more. And, this delicious meal and warm service comes at $10.99, not much compared to Chicago or even Madison. 

For spicy as well as non-spicy Indian food this newer player deserves credit for serving homestyle food. Overall, other established restaurants now have a very formidable competitor : Haldi !!!"}
{"text":"This place is literally my favorite Indian place in the city. They make fantastic south Indian and varieties of other regional food. In my travels, I've tried dishes found on this menu in Hyderabad, Bangalore, San Francisco, Toronto and the like - this place is one of the absolute best! I feel considerably lucky that we have such a gem in our city."}
{"text":"Short review: Everything is soup. From the curry to the chutneys. My veggie korma leaked all over my to go bag. I should have ordered six orders of naan (instead of one) to sop the various components of my meal. And no onion chutney! Subpar flavor and a bay leaf to boot."}
{"text":"After seeing all of the four and five star ratings I couldn't wait to try this newer place. I didn't experience any of this wonderful food.
 First of all the buffet table is one with a tray  on both sides but you cannot get to the other side because it's against the wall. This means you have to lean over to reach the other side which in itself isn't so bad except it created a major traffic jam on the day I was here. Two people trying to decide what to take can block the whole line and did most of the time I was here. The food was most of the usual stuff except a dish with crab claws in it. The claws were not really eatable, they were very small and I gave up trying. Maybe they were just there for flavor like bones in soup. It was good but like all of the food here very rich and spicy. The exception was the tandoori chicken legs. They were the best I have had. Tender and very flavorful. My partner and I eat at Indian buffets once a month and I would say we know our way around most of the dishes. They were way too spicy or rich so something for us here. Even my favorite, goat curry had something in it that just didn't taste right to me. Most of the dishes were like that as far as were were concerned. They may cater to a certain crowd that likes this type of Indian but it wasn't us. There are others far better. This one costs 13 dollars  which was overpriced, especially for the small selection of dishes. Give it a try if in the area. Maybe it's different on different days or maybe we like more Americanized Indian food. Up until now it was never a factor. The newer place in Middleton, Amber, has similar food and we love most everything there. Haldi Massala is not a place we would go back to but according to the other reviews lots of people do."}
{"text":"I'm very glad excellent South Indian cuisine is available in Madison, in a modest looking restaurant with outstanding food and friendly service. The dum biryani is superb and the dosas were delicious. Note the food is not (remotely) as spicy as it could be but much more so than in other Indian venues in town. Prices are reasonable and portions are large. What a treat!"}
{"text":"Ordered gobi manchurian and uvacharu mutton biryani. Disappointed as the food was not fresh. The gobi was soggy and appeared to be reheated in the microwave as parts of it were cold.  Biryani was spicy but lacked flavor and just wasn't fresh. The mutton pieces were rubbery and frankly not edible. Such food should not be served to customers...Will not be returning."}
{"text":"One of the best South Indian restaurant in the town they have lots of different options in the lunch buffet tasteful and service are awesome:)"}
{"text":"LOOOOVE this place!! This was a spur of the moment stop, having seen their Grand Opening banner (while out errand running)! We lucked out with a Saturday lunch buffet and OH MY!!! What a buffet!!! I've never been to a more plentiful-in-selection buffet! Every dish was fantastic! I had to refill TWICE, it was just THAT GOOD!! There were two buffet bars (with offerings on EACH SIDE), along with two soups and two specialty beverages. The dining room was open and airy and service was superb!"}
{"text":"Great food prepared fresh. We love coming here and eating their fresh dosas. This is the best South Indian restaurant we have been to in Madison."}
{"text":"I am terrible at describing Indian food, but I still love it. I've been to almost all of the Indian lunch buffets in the area, and I think Haldi Masala is my favorite.

When you first walk into Haldi Masala, you don't really see much. It gives you a simple family restaurant vibe. They don't go over the top with decoration and presentation. If my memory is correct, you eat off of the kind of paper placemats that your child can color on. The spread isn't as big as some other Indian buffets in the area either. However, they make up for the lack of variety with flavor and passion.

The main thing I noticed about Haldi Masala's food was that it was a touch more spicy than some of my other favorite Madison-area Indian lunch buffets, and that was great news for me. They also had some dishes that I've never had before like crab curry, and some kind of chicken with cashews. I talked to the owner about how I liked the food, and he seemed very excited to tell me about the different recipes that they do. I think I will be here frequently on weekends.

A bit of a disclaimer: I had gone to Haldi Masala's lunch buffet on a weekday once, and it was just ok. I'm guessing that they put out better food for the weekend when there are more customers."}
{"text":"my favorite restaurant in town, best South Indian food ,briyani and andhra dishes are excellent in buffet, makes me like am in Hyderabad."}
{"text":"The best and very authentic Indian food . Great service , reasonable prices and above all the fantastic , I loved the grilled part and Hyderabad's Dum Biryani ."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been to a restaurant where I had the pleasure of speaking somewhat extensively with the owner or chef. It's an aspect of dining out I've always enjoyed. Instead of the server flashing by and emitting a disingenuous \"How is everything tasting?\", we were approached twice by the owner Raj at dinner with specific questions about the dishes we ordered and if they were properly spiced. This is how I learned that this is one aspect of how Haldi Masala sets itself apart, by customizing the \"heat\" factor according to a customer's liking. We also discussed at greater length, in the break between entrees and desserts, the history of the six month life of the place, and what kind of place they wanted to create. This interaction felt more like being in a family's dining room than in a commercial place. And I'd have to say, it went a long way to confirming their assertion of a personalized, and flavorful dining experience. 

Three of us shared one appetizer, three entrees, an order of naan, and two desserts. The cauliflower appetizer, Gobi Manchurian, was cooked, breaded deep-fried flowerets in a thick tomato and onion based sauce not unlike a Mexican salsa in appearance. That was where the similarity ended. The combination of spices, sauce, the soft and chewy/crispy tongue shui of the vegetables made for an original expression of cauliflower. Our entrees included a Shrimp Byriani, a baby goat dish in a heavy curry sauce, and a chicken dish mixed with bread and rice and a curry sauce. Again, our server queried us thoroughly about our spice thresholds and tastes, and the results were perfect. The sauces in each of these dishes were, for me, explosions of flavors I'd never tasted, not like an expected yellow, red, or green curry. In short, wonderfully orchestrated. The Byriani was also blessed with a smaller amount of sauce, perhaps a little too much rice, and a fairly skimpy shrimp presence. But an orange curry which made for happy taste buds.

The absolute standout dessert here is the sweetened shredded beet. Presented in a fist-sized ball in a bowl, it had the flavor and texture of a chocolate cake. What a delightful surprise. The other dessert was a sugary clear broth with 5-6 tiny creamy and crispy balls, Gulab Jamoon. Light, refreshing and sweet.

As stated, service was appropriately attentive, not overbearing, and very genuine. Dinner for three with no drinks, and tip was around $20.00 per person. So my first experience here was that of experimenting with new Indian dishes, new flavors, and an overall great value. And I have a feeling there are many more nice surprises to be had with this original and new menu. I hope that Madison will embrace Haldi Masala, a warm and welcoming place."}
{"text":"If you like spicy food then this is the place to go.  Not so spicy you can't eat but spicy enough to wake your taste buds.  Excellent food and service.  Definitely a must try if you like exotic foods."}
{"text":"We came here first time and tried the lunch buffet, it was different and thought to try this place again.. however the server was super rude to us the next time we came here.. their loss.. never went again.."}
{"text":"Haldi Masala is absolutely fantastic. I'm new to the Madison area, originally from California, and was worried I would never find a great Indian place. All of my worries went away the moment I bit into my dish. First off, all the food is PERFECTLY spiced. Every single dish I tried, from tandoori to dosa, was absolutely delicious. I will warn, however, that the food is very spicy so definitely be prepared. Also, the service is fantastic. Everyone was very nice and accommodating. I am definitely coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Authentic Indian food that all of my family members love to come and eat. They also carry Indian beers and offer both Indian and Indochiense menu. It takes some time for them to cook but it makes them special.  They cook from the scratch."}
{"text":"Biryani taste is improved, please increase quantity of raita."}
{"text":"Every time I eat at Haldi Masala, I fall in love with it a little bit more. At most Indian restaurants, the lunch buffet consists mostly of the standard boneless meat cubes or vegetable pieces topped with a decent sauce. Usually, this is enough to satisfy your cravings for Indian food but still leaves much to be desired in terms of flavor and imagination. Haldi Masala elevates the Indian restaurant experience to a completely new level. 

The buffet offerings are unlike any other Indian buffet that I've ever been to. I am not an Indian food expert but the flavors that came out in each dish tasted so much of authenticity that I felt like I was sitting down for a homecooked family meal. At the buffet, there are selections for those who crave the standard dishes like Chicken and Paneer Masala and also those who dare to venture into seafood territory with dishes like Crab Curry and Shrimp Masala. In particular, the Chicken Biriyani seems to be a crowd favorite with most drumsticks disappearing soon after a new batch is prepared. Haldi Masala is also friendly to both vegetarians and meat lovers - the available options for each are almost equal. On top of that, the waiters are very attentive and will bring every table fresh batches of naan as they come out.

Overall, Haldi Masala is a restaurant that is unpretentious and deeply devoted to their culture, their food, and their patrons. They are a fine addition to the Madison restaurant scene and I would highly recommend that you stop by for their buffet at the very least."}
{"text":"Fabulous! They really understand biryani here (we had the haldi special biryani with chicken). We also had some wonderful mirchi bajji (stuffed peppers) as appetizers and a delicious malabar fish curry. This is now my favorite Indian restaurant in Madison. I'm looking forward to the hakka noodles (Indo-Chinese) and the Andhra- and Pondicherry-style dosas."}
{"text":"I traveled many times to India for my work as an international Photographer and chief. This is the ONLY Indian restaurant in Madison  that took me back to the spice market in Delhi with the  taste of authentic Indian food. Don't come if you want American Style watered down Indian cuisine, BUT if you want the real deal and an  outstandingly  delicious dinner,  for a reasonable price, you must try Hard Masala.

{"text":"Reviews are typically a verbose affair. I'm going to break with tradition and simply say that me and my fiancé have come here about 8 or 9 times -- each time carry out -- and each time it's been consistently amazing. Great value for what you get, delicious. Go here, try it and I'm sure you'll love it like we do. *drops the mic, leaves the premises*"}
{"text":"Haldi is delicious. Simply delicious. I pick up food for the week sometimes just so I can look forward to the currys in my fridge.
The Lamb Rogan Josh has that after kick of mild heat and heavy spice I love.
The Saag Paneer isn't too heavy.

The service staff has a knack for knowing when to be there and when not.

Haldi's could do 2 things to get my rating to a 5.
1. Make the dining area more intimate. Maybe some booths. It's noisy for my comfort.
2. Offer riced cauliflower instead of regular rice. I'd pay extra for this substitution and it would help me eat here Much more often. My paleo eating friends would agree!"}
{"text":"Came here with friend, and we got our fix of Indian food! Service was good; they were VERY diligent about filling out water glasses. A nice, quiet place to enjoy an Indian meal!"}
{"text":"Nice suburban Indian restaurant, cleaner brighter and better adorned than places I've been with similar quality food.  Pleasant family run place that gets a fair share of South Asian patrons.  They will make food spicy if you ask (repeatedly) for it this way.  Easy parking in front.  Try the murgh makhani (butter chicken)."}
{"text":"Great food and the staff is super friendly. The chef visits the dining area and is very polite . The goat biryani is to die for."}
{"text":"I've had the lunch buffet twice, and both times, it was exceptionally good.  Great selection, well spiced, pans quickly replaced as they got low.  The dosa was the best I have ever had.  The only suggestion I would make would be to add riced cauliflower for those of us who count carbs and would rather have cauliflower than rice.  The owner is very much involved and checks on restaurant patrons  - attentive, but not invasive.  Love Haldi Masala!"}
{"text":"The food are in big portions and are extremely good! I ordered a lamb entree. Was very spicy for me, but was very flavorful and made me want to keep exploring the dish."}
{"text":"Not bad at all.  I was expecting a bit more spice though.  I had the Tandoori chicken, shrimp fried rice, samosas, and garlic naan on my first visit.  I highly recommend the samosas and naan breads for appetizers at each visit."}
{"text":"This review is based on the lunch buffet. Food selection was excellent. Everything was labeled with descriptions and whether mild, med, or spicy so it's a good place to try many items if you're not familiar with Indian food. Service was exceptional. My water never emptied and the dirty plates were picked up right away. Fresh hot naan is brought to your table. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Favorite Indian restaurant in Madison. Excellent saag paneer and aloo gobi. Naan is always fresh and light, never greasy."}
{"text":"As soon as we entered, I noticed the poor lighting. The tables were clean though and staff was inviting. We ordered Gobi Manchurian which was amazing. Crispy, hot and full of flavor. Our paneer curry and malai kofta seemed to have similar curries but were nice. Rice bowls that come with the entrees had long and separate grains. We loved garlic naan. Dosa was not as good as I've had in most Indian restaurants and didn't come with coconut chutney.  
Decent food but definitely needs a lot of building upgrades. I'd dine at Om or other better restaurants next time"}
{"text":"I ordered choley generally this is spicy dish, what I got chane( garbanzo  beans) mixed in paneer tikka masala gravy that yellow sweat  gravy, I have never had such a bad choley Amy where .

There some of the dish are ok, but I would not recommend  nor going back.

Happy eating.."}
