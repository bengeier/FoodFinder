{"text":"It is really a nice place!!!!!!! Food: This place offer Northern Chinese food. They made the food in a really original taste. We ordered the chicken, noodle and soup. Also had a snack\"Tanghulu\", which is a Chinese signature candied fruit dessert. The noodle soup was really fresh and tasty. You can choose a small serve if you cannot finish a big bowl. Also we ordered \"Hulatang\". It is a signature soup in north China. It tasted like I what I had in China. Then, talk about the \"Tanghulu\". I think this would be the only place that I can find it in Toronto. They have a great choice of flavour for Tanghulu. But unfortunately, the time we went there was only the original flavour. They are also delicious!!!! And the price per serve was considerable, only $2.5. It tasted like what I tried in China!       Service: The service was good. We were greeted by the hostess when we walked in the place. She was very nice. They serve the food very fast. We didn't wait too much time."}
{"text":"Came here with my brother for lunch and ordered a couple of their items. Service was fast and the food was not bad. Definitely not a place for Dumplings, but their noodle dishes were okay.  If you can't speak or read Chinese you'll struggle a bit here."}
{"text":"2.5 Star  Whenever I come by this relatively new plaza on Midland just North of Finch, I always got a little confused...  I might visit one and write a review a few months or even weeks ago... and then it kind of disappeared and switch to something else but with similar menu and they even keep most of the interior deco.  Rain & Sunny Restaurant is one of those. This unit used to be Da Cheng  http://www.yelp.ca/biz/da-cheng-chinese-cuisine-scarborough serving home made hand shaved noodle. And now with a new sign, a new name and a new layer of paint it is now Rain & Sunny.  Menu is really similar as it is too specialized in Northern Chinese cuisine and hand shaved noodle.  Spicy Beef Noodle Soup ($6.50) has the chewy, rustic hand shaved noodle that I like. The broth though is really light with not much taste of meat nor spices. There were only a few piece of overcooked beef in my bowl, but I guess it was not too bad as they were not too good?  From reading their menu, seems like their speciality is Hand Made Lamb Noodle Soup in a milky lamb broth, I might give it a try one day.  Cash Only."}
