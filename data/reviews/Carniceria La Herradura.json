{"text":"This is a good place to get Carne Asada. The staff are always helpful and friendly. I recommend the queso fresco, its's really good, so is the pre-cooker rice. This is my go to spot for Mexican items. I really enjoyed the beans but my child didn't since they have a hint of chili."}
{"text":"They advertise a certain price, but charge a different price. You ask why- and you get a smirk from the guy and he will simply state that \"that's wrong\". Don't waste your money. Nor your time dealing with dishonest people."}
{"text":"Wasn't for me.  I'll have passed by this store dozens of times but never stopped that is until today.  The shop is small but offer a variety of different items that you can't find in your average grocery store.  On this visit I decided to buy some tortillas, chorizo, and one hot pre-made tamale. To be honest I did not like any of the items I purchased. The tamale was overcooked, dry, very little meat, and flavorless. Maybe the tamales had sat there too long, I don't know, all I know is it was the worst tamale I have ever eaten. I did not care for and the tortillas or chorizo, just didn't taste good."}
{"text":"Sadly this place is no good, the owner is dishonest and charges you more for what you get. My mother went to buy some carne asada today and she left disappointed that instead of getting 3 lbs of carne asada she got 2.5 lb. Their reason behind it is because they weigh the meat before grilling it, and they advertise it like carne asada not uncooked meat. We will continue to give another carnicer√≠a our business that are honest and give us what the carne asada like advertised with the same price as this store. The owner always has a face or don't talk to me as well. Honest review not going back."}
{"text":"This store is very clean and well-stocked. The quality of the meat and fresh items is excellent. I'm very happy to finally have a carniceria nearby."}
