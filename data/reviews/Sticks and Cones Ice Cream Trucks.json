{"text":"Stick and Cones has the best ice cream, hands down!  I can no longer eat the Krispy Kreme donut filled with ice cream, but if you can- do it!  It is a wonderful indulgence!  The ice cream in a sundae, or cone, or cup is all delicious too.  You really can't go wrong, and the owners are the nicest people too!"}
{"text":"Some of my favorite homemade soft serve I've had in a while. I don't know what they do to it but it's so creamy, not OVERLY sweet like some of the chains. I tried it at Food Truck Friday and they made me a fan. Check out their speciality sundaes, the price sounds steep but you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with ice cream, I don't know, but I know how you can go right. Head straight to sticks and cones. The ice cream won't look like much but who cares. Once you put this into your mouth you will need no more than what you have. Try the \"SMores Sunday\". Once you try it you won't regret it."}
{"text":"(Author's note: this review refers to the \"Cones\" truck, not the \"Sticks\" truck)

I'm not typically a fan of soft-serve ice cream, but since the Cones truck of Sticks and Cones parks itself in front of Gateway Village on a weekly basis, I figured, what the hell, it's hotter than the surface of the sun right now, and nothing quenches heat like a nice cold ice cream, Well, there are other things that quench a thirst, but since there isn't a beer truck that caters to Gateway Village, an ice cream truck will do.

But hot damn, I do love me their soft-serve, so soft and gooey and not so sweet. The Cones specializes in soft-serve sundaes, and there are several different combinations to choose from. I opt for the Carolina Gold, a spectacular concoction complete with caramel topping, chocolate topping, white chocolate sauce, crushed vanilla wafers. Oh my! So sinful. Screw my diet!

Check 'em out when you get a chance. You'll find them Friday nights at the Food Truck Night on South End, and you won't regret it. So what are you waiting for? The Cones is a hell of a lot better than the junk served up at TCBY or any of the other obnoxious DIY yogurt joints flooding the market these day. Man, those places suck."}
{"text":"Smashing Pumpkin blew my mind! That dessert is a game changer. Thanks Dave!"}
{"text":"Booked the Sticks truck for a private event. Karen was very responsive and clear about what to expect, pricing, etc. and accommodated a last-minute schedule change. She arrived right on time and the kids loved it."}
{"text":"I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream! Even better, this one is on wheels and serves up the tastiest of treats! 

The owner is super nice and generous. You can tell he enjoys what he does! From the Krispy Kreme donuts filled with soft serve ice cream or the homemade cobbler layered with ice cream and caramel, it is all scrumptious! 

Do what I do, eat dessert first...Find this sweet truck on Food Truck Fridays in South End! You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Amazing frozen yogurt!!! & the guy who runs/owns it is super nice!!! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Love!! The quality of the ice cream and toppings are excellent! 
Customer service was on point too! 
Thank you for the delicious strawberry cheesecake sundae. DELISH! 
Will definitely be wherever they head next. 
The owner did tell me they have a booth at the Renaissance Festival so go try them out"}
{"text":"We stopped by the Sticks and Cones ice cream truck at Food Truck Friday last weekend, because I'd heard they had some unique, delicious sundaes. We really enjoyed our mint sundae, but the price was too high for soft serve! It was very good, but I'm not sure it was good enough to warrant paying $5.75 for a sundae again."}
{"text":"We hired Sticks for our daughter's bday, and I must say it was one of the best ideas we had yet. Kids AND parents were stoked. It was fun and fairly priced. I would hire them again in a heartbeat!!!"}
{"text":"I have used multiple different ice cream trucks at events and my experience is not that of the person eating the ice cream but of using this vendor for an event.

First problem: they make you request a price sheet.  They then send you something that they claim is a price sheet but it is full of vague price ranges and the ranges don't list what products relate to those prices.

Second problem: is you get sent emails that dont make sense, not minor grammatical erros but random words and new lines in the middle of what isnt event a sentence.  You cant even guess what they are trying to write.

Third problem: they charge you for distance from Mint Hill.  I understand if you want them in Gastonia or Huntersville but if you are in Charlotte proper you arent expecting to be somewhat out of market.

Fourth problem: confusing explanations.  They give each truck a cute name so you have to lookup what the name means, instead of just referring to the trucks by what they serve.  Computers dont mind looking things up, people do.  Imagine if you were at a party and had to refer to people by their phone numbers and you had to lookup the number of the person you wanted to talk to.  The entire excercise is exhausting.

Fifth problem: they were the last if four companies to get back to me.  I actually ended up calling them and chasing them down so they never actually got back to me.

If you have a website make it useful.  If you arent available 24x7 for immediate assistance dont hide all the pertinent details from people."}
{"text":"Friendly service from a food truck that makes delicious ice cream cones and treats. Yeah, I'm a fan. Shocking, I know. 

There are two trucks to Sticks and Cones - the Sticks truck, full of ice cream treats on a stick, and the Cones truck, a soft serve van of sorts. For a mere $2 and change, I scored a positively delightful and generous swirl soft serve cone rolled in sprinkles from the Cones truck. It was glorious. It was fresh. It was gorgeous, actually. And, of course, it was super delicious! 

The Cones trucks offers a variety of specially made ice cream treats beyond simple soft serve. You'll find a variety of creative sundaes - one called burger and fries that I'll most certainly need to try one of these days. The folks who own these trucks are just as sweet as the ice cream. And they take credit cards. Yes!"}
{"text":"I got an ice cream-filled Krispy Kreme doughnut at Stick and Cones last night.  This ice cream truck was at the food truck rally at South End (Camden and West).  Sticks and Cones is a pretty straightforward truck selling ice cream and other frozen treats for a few bucks per order.

The ice cream-filled Krispy Kreme doughnut was $3.25 ($3.00 + $0.25 tax).  The owner had a box of raspberry and lemon-filled Krispy Kreme doughnuts and a vanilla and chocolate soft serve machine in his truck.  So basically, those were the flavor combinations available.  I went with a raspberry doughnut filled with vanilla ice cream.

The owner split open the doughnut and piled the cold vanilla soft serve high.  The high calorie concoction was served in a paper sleeve.  It was hard to eat with my hands, so I grabbed a spoon to eat some of the excess ice cream first.  The treat tasted exactly how you'd would expect and it's nothing you can't make at home (well, I guess you do need a soft serve machine, but regular ice cream would work just fine too).  It was really messy to eat and once the ice cream started melting, it seeped through the wrap, making my hands sticky.  This was kind of annoying considering there weren't any restrooms available so I could wash my hands.

Overall, though, I enjoyed it and the owner was a nice guy.  If I came back, I'd probably order something more \"standard\" and easier to eat (e.g. ice cream on a stick)."}
{"text":"Heaven on wheels! The truck was at Matthews Food Truck Friday and had a long line the whole time. It was worth the wait! 

Delicious soft serve ice cream served in a variety of inventive sundaes. I saw the Krispy Kreme raspberry donut sundae and knew I had to try it. So so good! My inner fat kid was cheering! I ordered 4 items and total was $17-18. It was expensive, but the quality was on point and I'll be back in line when I see this truck again!"}
{"text":"I'm a soft serve junkie, and Sticks and Cones really knocks it out of the park with the sundae options. I had the Strawberry Cheesecake Sundae and it was awesome. A few coworkers had other menu items and raved about them as well. Service is great, ice cream is delicious and well priced--this is a 5 star for me!"}
{"text":"Still the best soft serve in town!! The Smashing Pumpkin sundae was sooo good!!"}
