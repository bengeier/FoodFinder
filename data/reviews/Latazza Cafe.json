{"text":"Best lunch deal in midtown.  Fresh ingredients and friendly people.  Lines are long but so worth it!"}
{"text":"The chicken tikka wrap was delicious. The size huge and quality fantastic. Super great deal at 5.99   .Would go back."}
{"text":"Great value and quality. Everything is always fresh and delicious. Long lines but they move quickly and it's always worth it. Loads of options."}
{"text":"Latazza Cafe is maaaad cheap and I don't have to go outside in the cold to get my lunch. Their grilled chicken wraps are huge (like the size of an infant) and you can also ask for a Butter Chicken wrap which is not on the menu but it's pretty much the same thing with Butter Chicken instead of grilled chicken. If you work in the area and are looking for a cheap grab, Latazza is tried and true. If you're looking to go on a date, this is not your spot."}
{"text":"This is a really good place for lunch if you're in midtown.  The wraps are a really good value.  I ate here at least x10 already.  The chicken roti, which they have on some days (thurs or fri usually) is my favorite item."}
{"text":"5 stars. 1 for cheap lunch options in midtown! 1 for delicious lunch options in midtown! 1 for a wide variety of options in one place! 1 for cheap and delicious breakfast options! And lastly 1 for the owner his cheerful demeanor.

 -1 for being such a hole in the wall it is almost impossible to find unless you know what you're looking for but then another 1 star because the owner will LOAD YOU UP. These portions are huge and satisfying.

The line ups can get long but it's worth it."}
{"text":"lunch taste buds rejoice. Awesome price, quick service and - most of all - delicious fusion food.
thoroughly enjoyable.. the only downside - everyone seems to know how good they are and the line up during lunch hour seems too long, hard to get a seat inside also.."}
{"text":"This is a great and very inexpensive lunch option if you're at Yonge & Eglinton on a weekday. 

But this place is hidden in the 2180-2200 Yonge St office building complex. To access it from the subway, walk up the escalator inside the southwest corner foyer at Yonge/Eg and then walk down the hall, it'll be on your right. To access it from Yonge Street just south of Eg, enter the building next to the Rogers store, walk up the stairs and turn left.

Anyway...

Along with sandwiches (good BLTs) she makes several hot lunches and a soup every day, and they're all homemade, very yummy and VERY reasonably priced. Expect to find: jerk chicken, beef stew, schnitzel, lasagna, butter chicken, stuffed peppers, butternut squash soup, chicken vegetable soup.

The prices are amazing and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Hidden on the second floor, perched a block south of the Eglinton subway station.    You'd easily walk past a hundred times before taking note of what's there.  

But you should go inside.  

Because you heard a rumour about an amazing find.    Then you heard it again from someone else.    This mythical place.    You want to uncover the urban legend.  

Massive wraps, larger than a small child.    More vegetables than you can name without reference.   Unlimited toppings.   Made fresh to order.   Served with a genuine smile.    

All for $5.75.

There's a reason that everyone is always talking. 

Quite possibly the best lunch deal in the city."}
{"text":"Really like this place! The food is super cheap and the wraps are huge! You get to pick whatever you want and put it into the wrap! They are also super generous with their portions. The butter chicken is mediocre so I would stay within the sandwich options. The interior is dimly lit, sometimes I wonder if it's to conserve energy.  Either way super recommend this place! The staff is super friendly  and they get to know you if you go often! Recommend you go before lunch time to beat the rush because the lineup is usually out the door, which can take more than 20 minutes at the peak!"}
