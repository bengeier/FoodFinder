{"text":"I have been going to Sirna's for 16 years. The owners are class act kind of people!!! They have lunch specials every day which are awesome!!!! Great staff and friendly atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"Surf and turf was the special.  Excellent flavor and cooked to each individual's request!  Homemade Mac and cheese that is delicious! Very tentative waitress and the owner was hands on making sure we were pleased with everything.  Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"I grew up going to Sirna's AT LEAST once a week. Sirna's is one of those places that you walk into not knowing anyone, and leave feeling like you are a regular. The bar staff are very friendly and down to earth. The menu offers a good selection of food options, including GREAT pasta. They are also well-known for their Sirna burgers!! 

Sirna's is not much to look at in terms of decor or ambiance, but what it lacks in these qualities, it makes up for in service and good food/drinks."}
{"text":"Service is terrible if you are under the age of 70. Fact. And not just terrible, the (certain) servers are derogatory to a point. Very unpleasant experience. 

An older couple walked in as I got my drink, which was literally 31 minutes after I first sat down, and they were greeted with menus, waters, and a hello. 3 things I would've loved! 

Oh well, all places can't be winners. I'm just here to let you know if you're under 30 ( I exaggerated earlier, sue me) you'll probably have a similar experience. If not, you most likely got one of the 2,that I know of, younger and incredibly pleasant servers. I however will not be returning."}
{"text":"Peg P's review is spot on! Sirna's is a tiny family owned Caf√©/Bar that you may never have been there before but everyone welcomes you as if you've been coming there for years. - I met my best friend and one of her employees (Miss Betty) here for lunch last Saturday. Miss Betty said \" You haven't had a burger 'til you've had a Sirna burger!\" an I have to say the food is delicious. We started out sharing a basket of fresh-cut skinny fries, the kind that you love to sprinkle malt vinegar on, and an order of onion petals while waiting for our burgers (made from black angus). The two of them had the Sirna burger. I went for the patty melt, you know, the 1/3 lb. burger with grilled onions & Swiss cheese, topped with 1,000 isle dressing, served on grilled rye bread. OMG, Miss Betty was right!"}
{"text":"Always went here for the steak for lunch. Trying to remember the day of the special but think it was Thursdays that they were 9 bucks or so and they are large. You may want to check on that as well as the time in the early afternoon that it stops

Sometimes they run out of baked potatoes to go with it on those days but you can get a different side. Comes with a soup or salad too.

I literally can't comment on anything else as that is all I ever had there but for that it was worth it."}
