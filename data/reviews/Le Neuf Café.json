{"text":"Breakfast is my favourite meal so I was excited to try out this new place with my boyfriend. We went on a Sunday and had the Benedicto with brioche with a latte and a cappucino.  Overall the experience was nice. I found the service to be very polite and reasonably attentive. The latte I had was SUPERB and I would definitely return for that.   The Benedicto was okay. The sides (salad and potato hash) were not fresh, the hollandaise was a little too lemony and the eggs were a little over-done. Having said that, the brioche was so good it compensated for the rest.   Overall it was nice and I would recommend giving La Neuf at try, especially if you are a fan of excellent lattes."}
{"text":"We went today hoping to find great pastries and french food, the reviews were so great I was excited to try this restaurant. What a disappointment, first, they did not have any pastries, second, the service was really bad, third the food did not feel fresh, my quiche tasted awful. The only good thing I can say about this restaurant, is that it has is a lovely location right across the park."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Slow service. Great patio.   I'm giving it a 3 for the patio.  Shade provided by a huge beautiful tree.  Birds flying above you. Hard to beat it on a nice summer day.   Food is OK. Nothing special but not bad. $14 for a salmon crepe with boxed salad? Pricey.    Service was super slow. 40 min for 2 crepes? Come on!  Also completely forgot our orange juice. Had to go up to pay or else they would never have come with the bill. Don't go unless you have a couple of hours to spend on brunch.   There is no brunch place I know of with a patio like this. It's the only reason to go there. For food, value, and service there are plenty of better brunch places downtown."}
{"text":"My husband and I live in the area and we love this place for brunch during the weekends. Here's my review:  Food: Amazing and delicious! I can't name just one dish that I like.  Service: The waiters are really lovely - actually converse with the diner and recommend dishes, etc. We never felt rushed to order or eat our meals!  Atmosphere: It does get really busy during the weekends. We have always had to wait to get a table - no more than 30 minutes though (possibly quicker than that!). The café feels like you're not in Toronto but stepping into a little café in Paris!   Overall: great food, great service!"}
{"text":"Such a romantic little spot for a date (I was here by myself, waiting for my daughter at a concert). The tea was yummy and the pastry delicious. I will be returning to this beautiful spot with my husband."}
{"text":"Be ready that the menu on their website and the actual menu will be slightly different! Make sure that it's not a 'special day' when you can't order just couple of things you want and you have to order in bulk."}
{"text":"Adorable place, good & helpful attitude from servers. Nice shady patio off of a square, just a short walk from FiDi but feels like Paris! My intent was to come for a late lunch- but apparently I was too late as they were no longer serving food, just coffee & pastries. I did eventually order a chocopan and Espresso Martini- and must say that the martini was strong!!! It turned out I wasn't the only disappointed customer to discover lunch wasn't being served as two other women who sat after me, were also surprised. Since I'm not in Toronto often, it will be an effort to come back to try the crepes- but we will see. In the meantime, I will have a leisurely late afternoon cocktail & hope others will see this review if they were anticipating a late lunch."}
{"text":"Little cute coffee with very nice ambient. Service was very friendly. We had typical French baguettes for breakfast they were delicious."}
{"text":"Le Neuf  Le Love  The decoration, the feeling, everything about the ascetics is pleasing. The place is small but because the ceilings are so high, it makes the space look airy. The main chandelier inspired me (meaning I will be ripping it off).  The food is delicious. I've been here three times and I have been trying different things all the time.  1st --was the freshly made fig tart. The figs were fresh and tarty. The cream was not overly sweet, an overall lovely balance.  2nd --was the veggie quiche. This is nothing like the quiche you get at the supermarket refrigerated aisles. This quiche had fresh spinach, asparagus, tomato, and red onions. It was light, fresh tasting and evenly flavoured. (On that day they also had bacon quiche and salmon quiche-- my two friends got the other quiches and said they too were amazing). An order comes with a side mixed green salad and vinaigrette dressing.  3rd-- was the savoury crepe with ham and cheese. (I think it also comes with eggs, I opted out on that). The light sweet buttery flavour of the crepe was the perfect combination to the ham. I also ordered the butter squash ginger soup (I did not finish all because it was too much). This came with bread and what I think made the entire meal bomb, was the garlic olive butter for spreading on the bread. WOW!!!   Because it is super new, the staff does not appear to have it all together as of yet.  BUT the food makes up for it.   I cannot wait for my 4th."}
{"text":"I went this past Saturday around 12:30pm. The place was nearly packed, but my girlfriend and I got a table and were seated within a few minutes.  In terms of positives, the food was presented really nicely and tasted really good. We got the Benedicto on Brioche and the Galette méditerranéenne (prosciutto, tomato, basil and mozzarella inside a crepe).  In terms of negative, the food wasn't too filling and the service was pretty slow. There only seemed to be 2 waiters amongst the dozen or so tables, and our waiter only came to us every 15 or 20 minutes. At the very end, when we wanted to order a dessert and an almond croissant, one of the waiters cleaned tables for nearly 15 minutes before we caught his attention.  All in all, I might come back for a date - a bit too fancy to just have casual brunch with a friend. But otherwise, I don't expect myself to come back too many times."}
{"text":"Ah, the French! Do they do everything right? Judging from this charming, cozy, bustling French Cafe, the answer is clear: yes, yes, yes! It's a winning recipe: delicious food plus reasonable prices make for a satisfying, memorable meal. J'adore!   On my first visit, myself and a friend were quickly seated for lunch, and I ordered a large bowl of squash soup, which came with two pieces of baguette: the soup arrived quickly: it was hot, savory, and completely filling.   From grandmothers sitting in the bay window seat (the best in the house) to chic creative industry types perched on the bar stools, tourists to neighborhood regulars, everyone was chattering away, drinking their wine, swooning over their quiche and leafy salads and obviously enjoying their dining experience.   On my second visit, I had the beef in a rich peppercorn reduction sauce, with creamy mashed potatoes, carrot and green beans: I finished the entire plate. Our waiter suggested a wonderful glass of red wine for me: not the most expensive on the list, which I appreciated. The server, Emil, took special care to note that I had been there before: always a clever \"customer service\" touch to acknowledge repeat customers. Plus, at the end of the meal, we were treated to complimentary pastry puffs. When the bill came, I was very pleased to see that it was under $60. Frankly, for the quality of the meal I had, it was a steal!   Note: this place gets busy: very busy, especially at lunch. But the staff work hard to accommodate quickly. Also: the service is very polite, but also very French: you have to know how to take it: lots of charm, warm, and a bit flirty (which I love). Don't go here in a tightly wound ball of hunger because you're a type-A personality with a conference call at 1.41pm with Dubai that you absolutely.must.take. Seriously. This place is meant for those who love good food and aren't in a rush for the next big thing. It's meant for people who know how to live a little.      So: If you are looking for excellent french bistro cuisine and a cozy, elbow-to-elbow eating experience, you'll find it here.   My vote: A total gem. Go!"}
{"text":"We had a takeaway for couple of patisserie items. One was really good and one is really extraordinary. The atmosphere is very nice. We will be definitely coming back for a more serious treat."}
{"text":"Flung out of Kansas City and plopped into Toronto for the first time, I thoroughly enjoyed the city and all of its' busy hustle-bustle splendor.  I did what any smart tourist would do - I asked the locals for a recommendation for breakfast.  Le Neuf was the word on the street.  I put on my walking shoes and arrived at 7:45am.  I was greeted pleasantly, but told I was too early for breakfast.  (I hadn't yet grapsed the idea of \"Canada\" time.)  I took a long walk down by the pier for an hour.  Upon my re-arrival, I was seated on the patio overlooking the park, which was calm and relaxing.  I made a few new friends, a couple of little birds who sat on my table, as well as Le Neuf's little terrier dog.  PePe (I didn't know his name so I assigned a new one) wasn't moving too fast in the morning, either.  PePe saundered towards the birds when they landed on the tables and proudly kept watch on the property.  Despite the wait for the kitchen to start its' morning grind, I had a lovely breakfast.  The chocolate crossiant was crispy with lucious melty-gooey morsels inside, and the normandy crepe with apples and maple syrup was devine.  Le Neuf, thank you for your hospitality, breakfast on your patio turned out to be the highlight of my visit to Canada!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! I LOVED everything about this charming French cafe! Christoph gave us lovely service! He was super sweet and extremely quick to bring out our food! The vegetable quiche was INCREDIBLE. And the cappuccino was DIVINE! The atmosphere is dainty, bright, friendly, and open!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little cafe in downtown Toronto. Unfortunately, we had to wait at least 45 min for our food, and gave my eggs benny on brioche and not an english muffin, which I asked for.. The servers are all friendly and speak French"}
{"text":"Awesome food ! Great Terrace ! Dog friendly ! Perfect brunch cafe !"}
{"text":"horrible horrible service and rude lady server (seemed like she's the owner or manager there) we walked in , a friend of mine and I, asked if we could sit inside as patio was full, one of the Guys said yes. Waited for someone to bring us a menu, no luck so my friend went up and grabbed us a couple. We had to call someone to come take our order !!! Our drinks arrive (for a french style cafe I was shocked at the sizes served-- American !! You would think it would be the little Paris in Toronto but not the case) We ask where our dessert is, the lady says no, you have to let me know what you want !!! Waaaaat.. We already ordered it.. So she's like ok fine Dessert finally arrives. A few minutes later she also brings us dessert only to realize we already got it. Wow Dis functional team no doubt.  Half an hour later a friend of ours arrives and we asked if he can pull a chair and join us. At that moment a party of 5 had arrived with a reservation. The lady server comes to us and asks us to move to a different table.  At that point we were like it's ok we will leave.  Just an awful experience overall. It's too bad because their food looks good.  So much for great service in running a small business like this !!!  I would not recommend this place and I wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"Went here with coworkers. Expected result: Getting coffee. Actual result: Witnessing the most primal fury in humanity's emotional lexicon.  And like Orpheus, I must sing you the song of my descent into the underworld:  I climbed the steps of the porch, and reaching the plateau, I saw the clientele. Aspiring future wives of rich men, and men who desire an espresso lens to magnify their middle management bank accounts. Oh great. One of these places.  We entered the place. It looked nice. The menu was in french - a perfect opportunity to marry my B- in Grade 9 French with all the Rosetta texts of cereal boxes I'd ever read. Winner. Gagnon.  BUT THEN HE HAPPENED.  A man, a tanned man, an angry tan man.  With the same percussive force of that first ape attacking that second other ape, and cracking its skull open with a pop and no whimper, the saloon-style doors of the kitchen flung open. I expected the tide of blood from the Overlook Hotel's elevators to follow but instead the doors produced a scowl with legs. He had a pad of paper, a pen, and what seemed to be millennia of repressed anger finally breaking the valve that contained it.   \"Who is here to stay.\" Not even really asked but demanded. A cryptic, eschatological postulation. We said we're just here for coffee. He threw his arms down in disgust, as meteors to pockmark the nascent, un-terraformed surface of the hardwood floor to create future oceans. The arms didn't hit the floor, so the oceans will not exist to be containers for this man's liquid hatred for his pretty decent job.  He left to kitchen. We exhaled.  We went on with our happy lives, readily ordering americanos and chocolat chauds and 'is that an eclair?'s. All seemed well.  BUT THEN HE HAPPENED.  Somehow from behind this time, like a shadow of hatred, tan man performed a solo from Stomp Out Loud on his way back from the outdoor patio. Fine china in hand, this bull of a man exploded into the kitchen. Exploded back out, and as one of his coworkers was tapping an order into their iPad, he muttered a french word I've never heard (assumption: profanity[sexual]) and grabbed it ruthlessly from his friend's hands, rotated it with neck-breaking speed, and pressed the virtual buttons with murderous intent.  We could've sat at a table by a beautiful window, miming monocles to each other and pretending to discuss high culture, but instead we left with our souls. In the case of one of my coworkers: with his soul and a half-empty small size coffee.  VALUE: I had a hot chocolate and an eclair and it cost more than my car. I don't own a car.  SERVICE: For the speed of service, all I can really communicate is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=ViGNBLQpGWE#t=112 but to be fair, this was during a lunch rush.  FOOD: The eclair was worth it.   I wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"Adorable little French cafe, right around the corner from the Soho Met. Fantastic croissants and good coffee . Owner was super nice...until I got up from the table to pay. Just a habit for Americans, but don't do this is Canada. They get pissy and think that you think that they are not serving you quickly enough. So much for tolerance of other cultures :)  We were always there in the morning, so everything was super fresh. The chocolate croissants were still warm and gooey. Mmmmm!  We went 4 days in a row, so that should tell you something."}
{"text":"Great little escape away from the busy downtown while still being downtown! Tucked away in Clarence Sq, this place like many other Yelpers described is a hidden gem.  We were here at lunch time on a weekday and one thing to note is make reservations! The place was packed, but since we were only a party of 2, they managed to squeeze us in. We ordered the veggie quiche (~$11) and the smoked salmon crepe (~$17), a little pricier for lunch but well worth the price as they were both delicious.  The service was great even with just 2 servers in a packed restaurant, they managed to make it work. Can't wait to be back again in the patio season, as they also have a small patio outside."}
{"text":"Loved their atmosphere! Just walked in to take out passtesaries, which were excellent. Small and cozy and unusual place which reminds me my vacation in Paris. Defently will come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went last Sunday around 12 noon and we didn't have to wait. There were a few tables inside and outside.  We chose to sit inside because it looked so charming. Loved the ambience and decor! We ordered 2 classic crepes (butter/sugar) and they were delicious!! We ordered a fresh OJ which was cold and sweet (I hate when restaurants serve warm OJ!). Cappuccino was perfect! We would definitely come here again! Loved how it was just off Spadina but yet was so quiet!"}
{"text":"Wow. Pastries. Sweet treats. Meat and cheese plates. A great waitstaff. Awesome coffee. Great happy hour.   These are all reasons why I love this place. The staff is always accommodating and checks to make sure you are doing great throughout every course.   The best is when you get there after they have just gotten done baking fresh croissants. They are easily as good as they are in France.   Be sure to check out their weekend brunch as well. If there is a line it's worth the wait. Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Went here last night with my boyfriend. Immediately walking in, I was a complete fan. It's such a cute, European-style little place. We went thinking it was just a coffee/tea place, but they had dinner food as well. We only stayed for tea, but we would definitely come back again. The servers were very nice and friendly. The only thing I could complain about was that our tea took 20 minutes to arrive.. And we hadn't ordered anything else. The patio was super busy, but we were sitting inside, which was quite deserted. Other than that, it was a very enjoyable experience! Good place for a date. Took a few glimpses at the dinner plates coming out, and they looked so delicious! I'd really like to try the food next time."}
{"text":"Amazing, this place is just amazing.  Finally we have in Toronto a great coffee place.  It is like a little bit of France in Toronto. The pastries are outstanding, the coffee is great and the service is just extraordinary.  My favourite is the almond croissant, and the sandwiches are just FANTASTIC!!!  The owner is very friendly, she is just amazing.  I absolutely enjoy Le Neuf every time.  I go there sometimes to study and I feel like at home.  The only thing is that I wish they can open late."}
{"text":"Delicious food, but it took an hour and a half for my eggs to come. Likely will not return. After waiting an hour, I asked the waiter how long it would be and he said he has no idea and left it at that."}
{"text":"We ate breakfast there on Saturday morning. One hour later at home we both got very ill and spent  time eliminating. You can assume the reason. Caution"}
{"text":"Went on the weekend to try their weekend only menu. They were out of eggs benedict by 11. So disappointed. The service was so slow. They really need more staff for the weekend. We got coffee, 45min after ordering. The food came 1 hour late. Tables beside us ordered after us, ate and left before we got ours. Just terrible. They most likely forgot our order.   The Sunday menu was nothing spectacular, only good. Will not come back on weekends. Will stick to the regular menu."}
{"text":"This was the most disappointing service I've ever experienced. The woman serving us could not have cared less about her job and actually seemed annoyed to even be there. It took 45 minutes for them to make an iced coffee and caeser. That should have been our first inclination to leave but we hung around in hopes that the food would make up for the poor service. We ended up waiting another 45 minutes before walking out. I've never actually left a restaurant before but this place is an absolute nightmare. Do not go unless you have 4 hours to waste on breakfast."}
{"text":"Since my first review, I've been back here twice and the service and food were both disappointing.   I took my parents here for brunch on Sunday, and all 4 of our Eggs Benedict's were completely over cooked. My dad mentioned the eggs Benny issue to our server, and she barely apologized. It seems that the service is too careless for my liking - no one checked up on us until we were done eating (to bring the bill over).  For $16 a plate, we could have made a better salad and eggs Benny at home. This makes me sad because Le Neuf is so charming and cute, but next time I'm craving brunch, I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"It's good. Like many others said, cramped and busy, hard to get a seat.  The food was rich, delicious and very nicely crafted. A great brunch spot if you get up early.  Their coffee was really good. I'd love to come here for dinner, or on a rainy day and pretend I'm in Paris."}
{"text":"At first when I walked in I thought the service was really friendly but once we were seated the service was really slow and they didn't seem to listen. I ordered the norwegian and asked for my eggs to be poached hard with extra hollandaise sauce and it came yolky and I didn't have extra hollandaise sauce either. The homefries were really good, it was different cooked with onions and red and green peppers which gave a great flavor. The salad was nice and light. When one of the servers came to take our plates he asked how the food was but never stayed long enough to listen to our review. Although our dessert was really good we ordered the chocolatee it came fast and was really good but it took so long for our bill. Overall because of the bad service I rate this place a one star. I don't think I'd come again."}
{"text":"Petit café très sympathique au centre-ville de Toronto. Au nord du parc Clarence, avec sa terrasse exposée plein sud et un intérieur très convivial, le Neuf Café est  à proximité de King West et Spadina, à deux pas du Skydome. La propriétaire des lieux est une femme dynamique et chaleureuse par son accueil et son personnel est sympathique et avant tout francophone. Venez donc y prendre un café et déguster les pâtisseries, ici on ne rigole pas avec la qualité !"}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place.   Having good food in one thing, but great service, amazing decor/presentation and great food is what sets this place apart from others.  Great service examples:  1. Honest with wait times. Going the extra mile to ensure we get a table without giving us any false impressions that it would take 5 minutes when really it's an hour.   2. Remembering our order since our first visit and always asks if we want our usual. Giving us a great sense of value in our experience.  3. Going beyond whats expected. We had no place to park our car, the staff no only suggested where to park but also guided us on how to get to the parking place with ease.  and the list goes on.......  If you are looking for something trendy with amazing atmosphere. This is the place."}
{"text":"I invited people for breakfast and they were closed despite what Yelp said... Not cool."}
{"text":"This little cafe was always great for coffee, croissants, and brunch but they are now open for dinner.  The dinner was excellent. We started with foie gras and French onion soup. Authentic French style.   We then had lamb shank and cote de boeuf. Nice portions. Beautifully seasoned.   (Please note that their dinner menu changes with fresh available ingredients so not everything I mention may be available every night.)  Finally, the dessert and the cheese platter. Oh, my. We hear they import the cheese directly from France and their pastry chef has recently arrived from France.  The atmosphere is very nice and the owner, Fouzia, is very friendly and accommodating. Very generous as well. Throw in good music and wine and you have a great night out."}
{"text":"Around the corner from my office, been there many many times, and hosted my bridal shower here ( using my hubby's account). The owner, staff, decor, menu, all Parisian chic. Many times, I get lost in there-listening to the buzzing chatters in French, cutting into the egg Yolk of Madame Croque, then choosing one of the many wonderful small pastries, I imagine this is what Paris is like. A secret hideaway from work."}
{"text":"Great spot for coffee and breakfast in the morning, and a short walk from Hyatt Regency on King Street.  They play French music which creates feeling that you are Paris."}
{"text":"Waited 30mins before we were even acknowledged. Once seated waited 10mins and not even a glass of water. Sorry can't help with the food reviews as we walked out. The place wasn't even that busy!"}
{"text":"The quiche is amazing and cute place (minus the flies/nats inside).  They were short staffed this morning we were there but they were doing the best they could given how busy they were.  Coffee so so and other dishes we had were not as good.  But cute place!"}
{"text":"Our waiter was sweet, but the kitchen was super slow! Really slow. So only come when you have a lot of time and patience. The cafe is truly charming and the patio out front is leafy and a perfect place to pass time on a sunday morning. I had the omelette of the day which was supposed to be filled with mushrooms, mixed peppers and goat cheese, but it was mainly just cheese and eggs, so it was fairly creamy."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this cafe in early September during a weekend in Toronto. Popped in for tea and espresso and a delightful chocolate ganache cake one evening with a friend and came back for brunch the next morning.   I had the brunch special, an omelet with cheese and spinach, served with some lovely, lightly dressed greens and real home fries...potatoes, onions and peppers, lightly fried so there was still some crunch to the peppers and potatoes but perfectly cooked.  My friend had the three egg breakfast, which came with the same two accompaniments as well as two very lightly toasted slices of bread.    We sat on their small patio under a large tree. The cafe is tucked just off Sapdina but the traffic noises are quite muted. You don't feel like you're in Toronto here. It's almost like stepping into a Parisian cafe.  Beautiful spot, excellent service, amazing food.  I will be back when I'm in the city."}
{"text":"Don't let the decor and Parisian style fool you! It looks very cute and romantic from the inside, especially the decorations they have.   My friends and I were here for dessert only since it's a nice little bakery. However, we were very disappointed even though we received good customer service.   We tried the creme brûlée, apricot danish and profiteroles.   I find it unbelievable that a French place can mess up creme brûlée; I've been to Indian restaurants that have done a better job. After breaking in the top, the inside was too liquidly! It was soup! I was having a sugar soup...it didn't taste any better either. Just basically like sugar and I've had creme brûlée at many places in my life and this was the worst.   The apricot danish was too bitter tasting and cold.   The profiteroles were too bitter with all the liqueur.   The prices were $9 for each! Which I thought was expensive for the horrible quality of the products.   Overall, I don't think I would come back to this place because the desserts sucked. I'm not sure about the lunch or dinner menus.   If you're looking for lovely romantic Parisian type cafe go to Colette Grand Cafe instead! But better desserts and if you aren't satisfied with their food they will at least exchange it or take care of your bill. Where as here you don't have the luxury nor did they ask!"}
{"text":"Very cute place. The galettes (savory crepes) served with very fresh greens on the side) were very good although I would have preferred more vegetables and less cheese in my ratatouille galette. The croissants are really really good as are the financiers. My husband and I thought the blueberry \"pie\" - which was really a beautiful blueberry, well, shortbread, I guess - suffered by comparison to the croissants. The service is quirky.  The guys seem a bit diffident, even distracted to the point of surly at first, but then turn out to be just a bit harried and really kind and fun. I've eaten here twice on this visit and may do so again. One tip: they have meal times. If you come mid-afternoon you can get beverages and pastries and perhaps quiche but no crepes etc because the kitchen shuts down."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the quaintness sitting outside on the little shaded porch.  If you are in a hurry you might want to skip this place but we wanted a relaxing meal so it was perfect for us.   There was no wait when we arrived close to 1 on a Sunday.  Another couple that arrived just after us had their order taken first and their food and drinks came out very timely.  They were gone before we got our food.  My husband ordered well done bacon so we pretended this was the reason our food was so slow.  We enjoyed our drinks--my husband regular coffee with half-price refills while I had a chai tea latte--and the atmosphere while waiting.  We loved our waiter who was just helping out for the day and actually is a chef!  Was it the best service?   No because food was slow.  Would we return?  Absolutely!  It was just so pleasant and the food was good.  And while French may be the first language of several of the wait staff, speaking English was no problem.  We were dressed very casually while some were a bit spiffier."}
{"text":"Omg i'm in love!!!  I came here on a sunny Saturday morning. I got the table by the window. Ordered a chai latté and an almond croissant... yummy. The décor is simple but pretty. I felt super girlie being there. The service is great. The guys behind the counter were helpful and very energetic.   It was a lovely experience and I wish I could go back to that Saturday morning.  Will definitely be visiting again soon! Too bad they close early during the week."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience. Small, quaint, but with attentive, talkative, and knowledgeable staff. It was like being an honored guest in a friends house. I was eyeing the incredible dessert case from the get go, but managed to focus on the menu. The wine we requested was out, but we were recommended an alternate and offered the same price. It was excellent. I got a pretty standard dish: steak, veggies, potatoes. But wow. There was not a single item that was prepared to any standard less than excellent. The mashed potatoes were amazing. The green beans, asparagus, and carrot wedges cooked tender but still crisp. And the steak.... Hot dang. What an amazing cut and prep. Barely had to cut it. Dessert: Got a chocolate cake garnished with raspberry. If I'm short changing the dessert, I may have been a bit food drunk. It was incredible. An espresso paired perfectly. To top it all off, is in a tiny square with decent parking (at least on our visit).   This place deserves five star review. I hope you go here."}
{"text":"Super slow service with mediocre food. Cute venue. Has possibilities if they can get better servers and a better chef. Room for improvement."}
{"text":"Mademoiselle, comment ça va?  This place looks like a townhouse across a park, but actually it's a french cafe. Came here with a friend and tried their baguette and galettes for lunch. Their food is your typical style of a french cafe with croissant, sandwiches and crepes. Heard their brunch is quite good, so would come back on weekend to try it.  Finding a french cafe in the city with a park across does have a nice feel to it. I guess that makes the food taste better."}
{"text":"The best pain au chocolat!!!  The quiche Lorraine and service was wonderful. Great neighbourhood gem. Merci"}
{"text":"noon in the city  I loved everything about Le Neuf...except the service. It was odd, slightly rude and abrasive, but I suppose you can do that when you're serving out of your home? The owners are French (not Quebecois), which may be why I let them get away with the attitude and superior air they give off.  Le Neuf is a cute cafe and patisserie. It's hidden along townhouse row facing Clarence Park. In fact, it is 9 Clarence Park, just a stone's throw from busy King and Spadina - though you may forget that. It's a little oasis in the big big city.  It's great brunch, an adorable terrace, and a lovely selection of baked goods including macarons for the fanatics. They have a nice selection of benedicts, all atop brioche and lathered in tangy, creamy hollandaise goodness.  This delightful taste of Paris in Toronto was the adorable finale to my trip."}
{"text":"Quiche, so fluffy!  Sandwich was made with a fresh baguette served with a side salad.  Basking in the sun on their cute little terrasse made a lunch date with friends that much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"This is a great little cafe! Such a hidden gem:) they have lovely coffee and treats to pair.. The flavour of everything was fab! In a sea of chains in this area you'd be a total fool to go anywhere but here!! Great staff, they're very friendly and professional. For dT the price is very fair and reasonable for the quality of the products and portions."}
{"text":"THis place has the best almond croissant (served warm) I think I have ever had! The brunch food including the savory crepes and benedicts are very good. It is a small space indoors, as well as the terrace out front, overlooking a small park. Be prepared to wait to eat there, probably at least 30 minutes. Because the staff there is French, I did not expect over-friendly, but sometimes they can be straight-up rude, for no reason at all."}
{"text":"Pros Great atmosphere. Small place across the road from a park. Pretty chill. There's a patio but we arrived too early at opening time so they didn't let us sit there.   Cons Food is ok. Nothing special. I ordered a savory crepe. Wife got the eggs Benedict which she enjoyed.  There are a few reviews saying good things about the coffee. I thought it was average (I'm a coffee snob). I had a cappuccino and thought that they didnt do a great job with the foam for example.   A little overpriced IMO   Tip: Came on a Sunday and seems like they start seating people in the patio around 10. Bonus tip: avoid the cappuccino!"}
{"text":"I love going to LeNeuf Totally feels like France;) Fantastic for a brunch on the patio in the summer Great view on the park"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in king west - this is my go to brunch spot on Sunday's! It's a tiny spot with not a lot of seating and always packed but it's worth the wait. The patio is nice in the summer! Food is always great! Croissants and quiches here are very yummy - reminds me of my time spent in France."}
{"text":"Super slow service (almost 1.5 hours) and really unorganized. The food was really good even though they got my order wrong. Everyone speaks French (one guy spoke English)."}
{"text":"I love the coffee and pastries at this cute cafe and will come back for breakfast one of these days.  But I have one complaint that I have with other restaurants and cafes in Toronto:  IF YOUR WEBSITE SAYS YOU OPEN AT 8 AM THEN BE OPEN AT THAT TIME!  I'm so tired of showing up at a restaurant or cafe only to find it closed when the website says it should be open.  So typically Toronto.  Ugh."}
{"text":"Took my wife and daughter for Mother's Day brunch. Well worth the drive from Mississauga. The food was exquisite and the staff is super friendly! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is just the coolest place. The decor is beautiful. Gorgeous tables, ornaments and frames. If a friend who comes here regularly did not bring me, I would not have ever found this place on my own.   Had the fresh squeezed orange juice and Norwegian. Both excellent! Great service. Will be back here for sure on my next visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"Le Neuf is a cute authentic Parisian cafe/mini bistro located just a few minutes from King and Spadina on Clarence Square. When I speak to its authenticity, I'm not only referring to the decor and the type of food served; it is French-owned and even the waiters are straight from Paris-- oui oui.   Note: I have been coming here for a long time and overall, it is clear that they need to do better when it comes to service and at times, being short staffed; sometimes the wait is too long and the service feels like you're truly in France.  With that said, the patio is packed during the summer and especially at lunch time. I would recommend the croissants, especially the chocolate croissant which is my favorite; the buckwheat galettes are a perfect lunch option, along with their several salads and traditional quiches and crepes. The dinner menu serves up classic french fare like french onion soup, escargots, steak frites and steak tartare."}
{"text":"Probably the greatest customer service experience I've ever had. The staff were incredibly friendly and made you feel as if you were a longtime friend. The food was delicious (the dessert especially) and the atmosphere is just lovely. The only downside is that it's a small space so sometimes there is a long wait for a table, especially if you're with a larger party. Also, make sure to come earlier on the weekends as they do run out of food and close a large part of their kitchen after the rush."}
{"text":"Hidden gem!! A nice escape from Toronto almost like being in Paris for an hour or two. Love their selection of brunch and dessert options. Will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"Le Neuf cafe was a gem of a find! I felt transported to Paris.. or at least it felt like I wasn't in Toronto. It was so refreshing. My friend and I both ordered from their selection of Sandwiches on a Baguette and split the Campagnard (salami, brie, dijon, cucumber, lettuce) and the Basque (prosciutto, tomato, fresh mozzarella, basil pesto, arugula).  I preferred the Basque over the Campagnard but that waa probably due to the stronger flavours of the prosciutto that overpowered the lighter flavours of the 2nd sandwich.  I did not get a chance to try out their tempting display of dessers this time around, but next time for sure. i can't wait to go back for some authentic Parisian cuisine and experience. Decor was chic and lovely (I couldn't stop looking at all the trinkets), staff was friendly and I loved how they chattered amongst them in French!  For lovers of Paris and all things French, Le Neuf is the perfect escspe and ideal spot to spend a lazy Sunday with a good read in hand, musings to jot down, or brunch with your partner or girlfriends! It's definitely one of those cafes that I wanted to keep as my little secret... :)"}
{"text":"My favourite place to eat in the city.  Their weekend brunch is fantastic, as well as their meat and cheese dinner platter."}
{"text":"While this place has a great atmosphere, I have never had worse service in my life. Don't go here, unless you want to wait 45 minutes for a glass of water, and over an hour to get your order taken. It's too bad, but terrible service ruined the potential of this place."}
{"text":"This is such a quaint little French cafe. Came here for afternoon tea with a friend. The patio is quite nice for a sunny afternoon. Location-wise, the place is pretty easy to spot as it seems to be the only buzzling cafe across from Clarence Square Park.  I ordered a mocha and a fruit dessert for just a little under $10. They are known for their eclairs. Their dessert prices are around $3-$5; kinda pricey for that one little cake I ordered which is why I knocked off one star.  All of the waitresses seemed to carry a French accent. According to my friend, who was born and raised with Québécois-French, even she was scared to speak to them in French French out of fear they'd detect her Québécois-French accent. Would definitely come back for brunch!"}
{"text":"I went here last week for a coffee and snack. I ordered their version of a Brazilian coffee (kahlua) and my fiance ordered a Spanish coffee  (amaretto).I also ordered a cupcake.   The cupcake was sooo hard. I told the server and his response was \" it was in the fridge,you have to give it a minute \". Also my coffee came and it was a clear liquid for the shot that I poured into my coffee. I wasn't really thinking when I poured it in. When I started drinking it I realized it wasn't kahlua. I asked the server if it was kahlua and he said yes. I don't know why I didn't argue further, but it was probably because I honestly couldn't 100% remember that kahlua was not clear at the moment. Anyways, it definitely is not clear, and it tasted disgusting.  Eventually the owner came by and said \"you don't like this? Re the cupcake, I said no. She took it and put it in the table next to us and said something in French. And then told us in English that the guy she passed the cupcake off to was the pastry chef. He stormed off, and I was mortified.   That was their second chance I gave them. The first time I got an almond croissant, which was stale."}
{"text":"Le Neuf is a lovely little cafe in the middle of downtown that takes you far away from the hectic lifestyle. It's located on a quiet street, right across from a park - probably the only quiet little patch in the downtown core.  The patio is lovely on a sunny morning, and the inside is cozy and feels like Sunday morning (no matter what day it is).  I had the Norwegian Eggs Benedict - which was really nice and light. But filling. I had brunch with a few friends there, and they all seemed to enjoy their plates of food. (Except for the crepes with basil and tomatoes, which was a little meh). After we were done eating, we noticed the table next to us ordered the caramel waffles - and Oh My! That smelled like heaven. I am going back to order that next time."}
{"text":"I am from Montréal and discovered this lovely Parisian decorated patisserie by accident. Wow, this is THE BEST croissant I've had in a long time - buttery, flakey and just soooo good. And it was inexpensive compared to what I have at Pusateri's. I purchased 3 croissants, 1 pain au chocolate + 1 americano, total of $13.50. My co-workers also agreed that this croissant is the best. And I've been to Paris many times so I know what is good and bad in Toronto. I will definitely return for lunch and dinner with my husband."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe nestled just away from busy Spadina. Sat on the patio for a morning latte  and enjoyed the green space of Clarence park (minus the hobos). Didn't have breakfast but everyone around me was ordering brunch and it looked delicious! Nice assortment of pastries from the cafe. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite cafes especially on the weekends. I really like their benny, the portobello one is SUPER filling. And their caramel mocha latte or something was really good too. I've ordered it so many times and can never remember the exact name. Their sandwiches are just okay in my opinion, I would probably much rather go to Mildred's for brunch if it was a weekday. But thumbs up for the cute atmosphere, and coffee!"}
{"text":"We happened upon this little spot totally by accident. We were so charmed by it's existance on a side street that we changed our plans and decided to have breakfast. After being seated on the outdoor patio we almost changed our minds....the gentleman who was host/server was a little biting and long in visiting the table. I suggested to my sister to pretend we were in France. Once he caught up things went swimmingly. I got the Croque Madam- yum. She got the french toast- again yum especially the caramel sauce to pour on it. Coffees were great.  There is seating inside which accomidates larger parties. The menu spans the gambit from omeletes to quiche to several eggs benedicts to varieties of crepes. Inside there is also a case of exquisite pastries to pick from.  A few days later we stopped by to grab croissants and sit in the park across the way to break the fast. That was a great idea."}
{"text":"I totally dislike this place. It has a fake Parisian atmosphere and it smelt like bleach when I went. Worst part was, the barista made me this GIGANTIC latte (basically hot milk in a huge cup) and charged me nearly $6 when I was expecting a normal, regular sized coffee. Now, I order a lot of coffee and from experience when you don't specify a size it is correctly assumed that you will have a regular. Why was it assumed I wanted a LARGE hot glass of milk?! When I reacted to this the barista was just down rude and told me there was a minor difference in size. Um, no, there wasn't. I paid, and I left and I will never go back."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss.   The last two times have been a miss.   If they are slow, its fabulous. If they are busy, the servers run around and it's uncomfortable to be around.   We went for a work lunch and no one greeted us at  the door for at least 10 minutes. Then we were seated but no one came to take our order or talk to us at all (the place is small!) for at least 15 minutes. We could tell the food was going to be awhile, so we opted for take out.   Bought a stale sandwich and ate it in the park. Bottom line - don't go on a work day if you're on a time limit."}
{"text":"Okay so disclaimer: I'm writing this 5 star review based on a croissant and hot chocolate. But they were both really good!   Most importantly, I just absolutely adored the vibe of La Neuf. It just seemed so... French. The barista was even French. The converted house is perfect, the decor is perfect.   I want to eat French pastries and waste time here daily.  I mean I wont but I WANT to. Will definitely at least come back to try lunch though!"}
{"text":"Coffee was really fresh. I had the quiche with bacon and leeks (served warm), which I'd definitely order again. Comes with a side salad, which was a bit bland but not bad. GF had the ham, cheese, pickles, arugula, and dijon sandwich on a fresh baguette, which I was fortunate to sample. Really good.  I would definitely eat here again. Service was a little slow (took a long time to get the coffee) but not bad."}
{"text":"Le Neuf is a lovely little cafe tucked within Clarence Square. Lauren and I were staying at the hostel next door and were delighted by its convenient location. There's nothing quite like a fresh-baked almond croissant in bed. The atmosphere is rather monochromatic, but it still remains a comforting cafe. It was a bit chilly while we were in Toronto, but I imagine the outdoor seating is lovely when it is warm. Though we primarily were infatuated with the croissants, the two of us were lucky enough to try some of the unique croissants they had on menu. I tried a combination of pear, spinach, and blue cheese, while the lady dined on some sweeter combination of honey, banana, and pecans. The staff was quite friendly, I believe we developed quite the report with them over the duration of our stay (they learned to predict our croissant orders in the morning). They even indulged us in some off-menu nutella-latte creations! We were ultimately very pleased with Le Neuf. We would be delighted to return and spend our mornings indulging ourself on fine french-canadian cafe cuisine.  My only \"complaint\" is that we couldn't quite steal their wi-fi from our room next door. It worked only intermittently."}
{"text":"Such an unassuming, cute French style café! On (in?) Clarence Square, you're a few steps south of King off Spadina. Came here on a Tuesday afternoon to meet someone. It was around three o'clock so it wasn't too crowded; however, by five, there were a lot more patrons. This place is small with maybe six or seven tables. I'm disappointed in myself for not taking photos of the interior - even the coasters on the table were French themed. Service was casual and attentive at the same time. The menu was extensive with a lot of espresso based drinks, teas, treats, and actual meals. I only had a tea (Kusmi), but I can't wait to return and try their treats, brunch or both !  Good for: coffee/tea, light meals"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  This quaint French cafe succeeds in carving out its own serene and peaceful alcove within the tumultuous concrete jungle.  I came here in July with a friend for drinks.  I already had enough caffeine for the day, so I ordered a hot chocolate, and tbh it wasn't that great - I remember it being fairly creamy and not very chocolatey.   I was just truly impressed with the decor and ambiance of Le Neuf - it was a mini-escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.  We sat on the patio which has a nice view of the \"park\" that's across the street.  Unfortunately, I didn't try their food, but fortunately, that gives me an excuse to pay Le Neuf another visit."}
{"text":"I came here for the very first time to try their brunch menu today. The brunch menu prices are in par with most brunch places.  The decor was nice giving a small French cafe atmosphere. I do think that the over all space is very small; so this place is really only good to come with one other person.  It can't really accommodate for bigger groups. The food quality was average. I will come back to try their regular menu though."}
{"text":"Ate here for breakfast because it was right around the corner from where we were staying. We walked into this cute little french looking cafe and the food was great. Cafe ole' was up to the Parisian standard and the crepes were as well. We ordered a savory crepe consisting of over medium eggs, brie, bacon and home fries it was delicious. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Great view, cutest decor, delicious food! I went there on a Sunday around 3pm and there was still a line, which almost made me go somewhere else since I was starving! I'm glad I didn't though :)"}
{"text":"I like the place and its coffee, but I really hope the owners do something about the staff! The server, a young lady, was talking with two customers who were about to leave when we got there. We had to interrupt them to order after 5 minutes and then waited for 15 minutes until their conversation ended and she served us (I am not exaggerating!). She did not apologize and even served us in a rude way while we did not complain at all!"}
{"text":"This café is really tucked away in Clarence Square and the first time I went I had a hard time finding it. The café itself is small, which means you run the risk of having to wait for awhile for a table, though we got lucky and didn't have to wait for more than a few minutes.  I loved every bit of the meal here! We tried the croissant, pain au chocolat, smoked salmon sandwich, and coffee. The coffee was smooth and made for the perfect match for the pastries. The croissant and pain au chocolat were buttery and crispy on the outside. The sandwich was made on delicious bread -- French baguette.   I would definitely make this a breakfast or brunch stop -- or even just for an afternoon snack. The atmosphere of the café is lovely, the décor is cute, and it's tucked away out of the typical Toronto busy-ness."}
{"text":"Got some crepes and desserts here.  The crepes are abysmal but the desserts were good.  The restaurant ambience and decor is nice and a good place to eat.  The French onion soup is recommended.  The dessert while it was good; were imported from somewhere else so not made by the folks.  Relatively overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"I feel rusty writing reviews...need to get back in the habit.  I checked out Le Neuf cafe with fellow yelper Denise. Its along a row of houses just north of Clarence Park, on the NE corner of Spadina and Wellington. There is a small outdoor patio with bistro chairs. Because of the cool weather we decided to sit inside, which was cozy and not too loud. I love the decor-French eclectic and elegant.  I went with the omelette of day, served with home potatoes and salad. It was great, well cooked, soft cheese and peppers filled. Denise had their smoked salmon sandwich-huge serving size! They use the whole baguette!  Overall a pleasant dining experience. It felt intimate and for a moment you could imagine yourself in France in a small cafe :). This place is new and I got the sense they are still finding their rhythm, but service was friendly and relatively on time.  Good place for breakfast, brunch or lunch."}
{"text":"Our experience at Le Neuf lasted about 1.5 minutes. My best friend and I had planned a foodie tour in toronto as my birthday gift for her! Le Neuf closes at 6:30pm and we got in exactly at 6:27pm.   There was only 1 couple by this time occupying the small cafe. We ran in and looked at their array of desserts, from Blueberry mousse (we ended up choosing this one), chocolate, croissants and so many other delectables.   The owner reminded us that they are closing in a few minutes so offered to give it to us in a take out container, which was fine because we had to make it to seven lives for tacos before they closed at 7pm.   Unfortunately by the time we did eat it, the toppings and jelly layer on top of the mousse had slidden of the side. FORTUNATELY it was still delicious! It wasn't too sweet and there were crunchy almost cookie like bits surrounding the mousse which gave the dessert good texture.   I'd like to go back and try on of their chocolate creation and actually sit in and enjoy their french decor.   Alas til next time!"}
{"text":"I had a amazing birthday breakfast for with my girlfriend. Food was great and the service was excellent. Felt like we were in France. Thank tou"}
{"text":"Great food, great ambiance, nice owner, and good coffee. Loved this place. Wish it were closer to home in Los Angeles! :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to grab a bite close to where we were staying, and La Neuf was a few blocks away. We went for it.  The place is cute, and on the small side. When we went, people were all sitting on the patio instead of inside, and we joined the crowd. It was not too hot or humid, though a few of the trees were dropping little bits of whatever.  The service was pretty good and what we would expect. The server was very nice. We had water and ordered one of the sandwiches, the one with prosciutto, mozzarella and pesto. I had the savory crepe with egg, bacon and cheese.  One of the downfalls of many places like this is flavor. My wife's meal was very tasty, and she is hard to please. She said it all tasted fresh and vibrant and wanted to continue eating prosciutto. My crepe was lightly seasoned - it needed salt - but I did taste some pepper in the egg. The bacon was tasty as well, but the potatoes in the crepe, while cooked well, were bland.  That was all I could find fault with. I would like to try some of their sweet offerings as well. We went to dinner, but I'm willing to bet that breakfast is even better."}
{"text":"My fav cafe in Toronto!  I love this place because: 1. Food - their crepes are to die for - I just couldn't have enough of them (and I've had crepe in Paris too) 2. Dessert - just amazing! 3. Ambiance - As french as it could get  Scope for improvement 1. Variety (well that's optional - I still love them) 2. Price - it's a bit pricey - but well deserved :)"}
{"text":"Specialty: Patisserie/Brunch Menu items: Benedicto, Norwegian & Chocolat Viennois  Le Neuf Cafe is the new trendy coffee and pastry spot in Toronto. Facing south, on the north side of the recently revamped Clarence square on King and Spadina, Le Neuf brings a little bit of Paris to our city with delectable pastries, galettes, crepes and chocolat chaud selections, setting themselves apart with a lovely Victorian decor and a laid back atmosphere.  Having heard that Le Neuf also offers a killer brunch menu on weekends, I decided to head over to test my acquired Parisian skills and hopefully bring back memories of La France. From the moment you enter the premises, you get this feeling you are no longer in Toronto and are on vacation visiting yet another trendy coffee shop in Paris. Checked! Memories start coming back to me and I am immediately curious about this place.  The brunch menu arrives, and I know I absolutely have to test these guys on their chocolat chaud execution. Without much hesitation I ask how the chocolate is made. The waiter smartly replies is not powder chocolate and there is no water content, this is pure chocolate that has been melted to a liquid state and mixed with heavy cream. Ding ding, Chocolate chaud, checked and verdict? Delicious, probably one of the most decadent, light and creamy hot chocolates I have had in Toronto.  Next up is my obvious order of the Benedicto. This is Le Neuf's take on eggs benedict served on either French brioche or English muffin. Going for the obvious choice, the brioche, the eggs are layered on top of thin prosciutto slices and tomato, smothered in a fresh and light hollandaise sauce, topped with green onions. Though the egg yolks are not as soft as I would have normally like to, the sweetness of the bread coupled with the salty prosciutto and buttery flavours running from the hollandaise, make a perfect symphony in one's palate.  The Benedicto also come accompanied with a refreshing mixed greens salad that helps cleanse my palate as I dip my fork into the buttery eggs; as well as home fries that add a nice layer of texture and taste. Though I did not get to try many of Le Neuf's pastries, I have a feeling these are just as good as the shop set out in its mission to be - become a true café parisien in the heart of Toronto.  On the service side, my first visit was a bit of a hit and miss as the waiter forgot my lovely chocolate which I got after my food arrived, as well as was asked to move to another table to accommodate for a larger party. A bit disappointing since this place is all about a laid back atmosphere, however I have given it the benefit of the doubt given that their food overcompensates for rather small service oversights.  Buen Provecho, Foodies Inked."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, with the view of the park, very nice and friendly service. Great brunch and pastries. Only down side is that they don't take reservations on weekends, and so you have to wait. Nevertheless, it is worth it."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a saturday, waited about 20 minutes to be greeted,then seated right away. Nice cozy lil cafe,great food & great service was worth the wait. One dish portion can be shared between two persons. Will come back again for dessert next time!"}
{"text":"Loved it! A weekend in Toronto and stumbled upon the doorsteps for Brunch. It's literally the first floor of a townhouse and the ambiance is comfy. It's a small place so reserve or prepare to wait a few minutes. As for the food, the chef knows what he/she is doing. The Florentine on brioche is amazing! A friend ordered the Chef Omelette which was so delicious. Will definitely go for another round when back in Toronto...."}
{"text":"Never coming to this place again. Is lunch time, it took about 10 mins for the waiter to come, i order a salad with chicken my friend a sandwich, it takes about 15 and we get a sandwich. 5 minutes after chef comes out to tell me they send someone to get chicken. Ok nice of them to do that, she said ur sandwich is ready i can bring it out first, i said ok and thought maybe she mistaken. But i got a veggie sandwich???? So i took my plate and walked inside to let them know I order a salad. And now I see they only have one waiter for the whole restaurant that was packed and the poor guy was all over the place. Who has only one new waiter for the whole place at rush hour?. Anyways i asked to pack my salad, 5 minutes after they came back with the salad. I tried to pay but no way, poor guy was trying to process payments for some other customers. I had to ask my friend to please pay what I owe because i have yo leave( at this point i shouldn't even be paying) I open my salad when i got to work and seriously what i found was one slice of DELI meat in the salad, omg seriously how ridiculous is this.  No chicken whatsoever. You can see it in the picture what a Joke! Oh yes so they still charge my friend $15 for this ridiculous salad."}
{"text":"More like Le Long Wait Cafe  For 5 people, we waited over 30 mins to get our food after ordering. Okay, it was somewhat busy but bunch fare shouldn't take long whip up. It's mostly eggs and bread anyways.  The food was medicore. I got the eggs Florentine and it lacked any flavour. The blanched spinach was bland and priced at $14, it was expensive for eggs, spinach and English muffins.  The best part was the potatoes. Although it was shriveled and sad looking, they ended up tasting pretty good. It was crispy on the onside and seasoned well.  The decor is cute though and the servers speak french so that gives it a more authentic French cafe vibe but the egg dishes need some work.  With so many brunch options downtown at this price point, I would skip Le Neuf and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I tried giving this place a few chances but every time I've been there it feels like the waiters act like they're doing me a favour. The two times I actually sat down and ate there the pastries were really tasty and the coffees were good. But that's something you'll only enjoy if your can get over the poor service.  One time we were refused brunch menu because we were sat down literally 2 minutes after the time they serve brunch and were told the kitchen was already closed. There was also another time when the outside waiter pretty much glared at us for waiting patiently by the door and told us if we wanted to sit inside we should \"go find for yourselves\" if there were tables. We went inside and stood awkwardly waiting to be acknowledged and eventually gave up.  It's a shame, the place is cute, lovely location, food seems nice, but the service alone puts me off going there and I doubt I'll try the place again."}
{"text":"I actually found this place on Yelp when I was looking for a place for a bit of breakfast in the area. So lovely! Light, airy atmosphere, tiny-but-nice patio, the usual French clichés (but in a good way), adorable waiters with adorable accents.  But more importantly, the food. We ordered the eggs portobello, the french toast, and a crepe filled with pears and blue cheese. All wonderful. And on the way out, grabbed a Paris-Brest to go, which was absolutely perfect! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I really, really want to like this place. Quaint little place close to me? I found it on Blog TO looking for quiche. But it took over twenty five minutes to warm up quiche and bring it out (I had to remind them), and it came out burned on top. Apathetic service. (I don't mind pouring my own water, but it is the first time I've ever had to.)   Maybe it's an off day - on the inside, the quiche is lovely. But don't serve your customers burnt food."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! It's like the mini Parisian cafes in Paris. It is a hidden gem within a residential-like area. A cutesy place to bring your date to :)  I'd recommend the CHOCOLAT CHAUD AU CARAMEL. It was recommended by the waiter who was very friendly. I was going to order just the chocolat chaud but he mentioned that the one with caramel is a customer-favourite.   We ordered the desserts that were available at the store front. They had everything that's not listed on the menu haha. The waiter took time to explain to us each dessert and we were happy with our orders.  Will come back to try their brunch menu :)"}
{"text":"What an endearing little Parisian café! The ambience and theme of this café is definitely its selling point. Everything from the wall decors to the furniture and the lighting fixtures are absolutely adorable. There is just something so nice and comforting about having a sip of tea here. Not to mention, the server's hurricane french just adds to the authentic Parisian feel.   The toasted Almond Croissant I ordered was hands-down, the best croissant I have ever had. The French definitely know how to make croissants right. If you feel like a nibble, definitely go for the Almond Croissant."}
{"text":"We were in town from Chicago and wanted to find a real French cafe - Le Neuf didn't disappoint! Brought our 3 sons 14, 12 and 9 and they had the Nutella crêpes with bananas and strawberries and couldn't have been happier. I had an almond croissant based on the below review and it was perfect. My wife had the spinach and goat cheese galette and the spinach was fresh and the chèvre creamy. Nice polite well trained bilingual staff made us feel welcome. We sat inside and it was fine even on a hot morning. Coffee was also very very good."}
{"text":"Had brunch here last week on a Saturday. I had to wait 15 minutes for a table but this lovely restaurant was worth it! The restaurant is small and had about 12 tables so try to come early to avoid waiting for a long time - they do not accept reservations. The service that we received was wonderful recognizing that there were only two waiters to oversee the restaurant and one of them was making beverages most of the time. I ordered their eggs benedict with salmon and hollandaise sauce over brioche bread. Their potatoes were hand cut, their coffee was incredibly fresh and each meal came with side salad as well. They also offered pastries from Thorbor's so I had to also order a croissant..delicious and fresh! The prices range from $10-20 per entree. The room got warm very quickly which made dining a bit uncomfortable but other than that, no complaints. The restaurant does remind me of France - small spaces, good food and constant busyness. Will be back for sure if I am in the area again!"}
{"text":"Bottom line: Love this place! Recommend it to everyone!  Favourite dish: Croque Madame   My experience: A cafe with delicious weekend brunches that has actual french people from France working in it. Should I say more?   It is a great small restaurant with an eclectic boho chic interior and a patio that accommodates about 4 tables. Great view of CN tower and a small green park, so if you love to sit outside you'll love it. Menu has great option of French and Canadian food, and an array of beautiful deserts. They also do pick-up if you feel like having a fancy brunch at home.  It is truly a hidden gem & perfect for weekend brunch."}
{"text":"I went there to grab a dessert and ended up getting this cake that had three layers: chocolate, white cake, and cream. The cake tasted great but it was expensive considering how small the piece was. I paid $6 for a small piece of cake to go. It was tasty but I don't know if it's really worth the price."}
{"text":"Niche little place that seems pretty authentic. Food and drink all aesthetically pleasing. I just wish I could give it 3.5 stars. The service is extraordinarily slow because they have very few people actually working as waiters. There's literally one poor waitress who's walking around very quickly tending to everyone. She looks tired. Like how hard is it to employ more than one person on waiter shift on a Sunday after noon?!!"}
{"text":"Great food, no air conditioning, spotty customer service at best. Slightly pricey sandwiches, but yes they are well made, tasty and fancy-shmancy."}
{"text":"My initial experience upon walking in and ordering my tea was interesting. I was ready to give this place a 2-3/5, but then the guy who was serving us surprised me and gave me the best experience I could have possibly hoped for.  Context: If you know me, I have an anaphylactic peanut allergy, making any kind of food consumption particularly dangerous for \"may contain\" environments and situations where the desserts are either made offsite or brought in from another bakery.   The desserts in this instance were brought in from another bakery, and thus the guy couldn't guarantee my safety. Dejected, I was ready to just order a tea, when he said \"but wait, I can probably whip up something special for you\", and boy, did he impress.  The picture is what it looked like before I absolutely demolished it - but basically, it was the perfect dessert. Warm (bread?) on the outside, cool (vanilla ice cream) on the inside, covered in chocolate sauce. It was a perfect match - cool/warm, soft/crunchy, and for a few minutes, I tasted heaven.  I'm very glad we found this gem; I'd come back any day of the week for that kind of service.  Pros: - GREAT atmosphere - it's a house converted into a cafe - what more could you ask for? - AMAZING selection of teas. I had \"euphoria\", but I was extremely impressed by the variety in offerings; normally, tea shops have a maximum of 3-5 teas, but this place easily had ten (and counting!). - IT HAS A PATIO. Think about it - it's summer, you want to sit somewhere nice, and people-watch, with a nice coffee/tea and some food. Where do you go? HERE. Sure, it's winter-time when I wrote this (complete with snow & below 10-degree weather), but it's definitely a nice thing to think about - AUTHENTIC French experience. The person working there was definitely a native French speaker. If I wasn't with people I was just acquainted with, I definitely would've tried to converse with the little French I knew. -- This includes the varieties of teas and desserts. Didn't try the other menu items, if they had them, but in my experience it's not often you come across a Parisian/French cafe in Toronto.  Cons: - Not amazing for bigger groups. We had 8 folks in our party, so it made seating arrangements particularly interesting. The person working there was able to accommodate us after shifting things around, but since he was the only one there, we could tell it might be a little troublesome. Not a big problem, but definitely interesting. - It's TINY. I think that's the point of a cafe, but at the same time, it'd be nice if it was bigger than the bottom floor of a house.  Apparently they've opened a new location! -- I definitely have to check it out in the future. Try this place out if you want a nice, quiet environment!"}
{"text":"Great lattés, you have to try the Chouquette (it's like the pastry from profiteroles but without the crème pâtissière, and rock sugar on top). It's light and very tasty.   I also had a crêpe and it was great. You need to try both types, the sugary and the savoury ones."}
{"text":"I came to check out this place because it was close to where i live and had good reviews on yelp. I must say , I was disappointed by the food. for what you pay for, IT'S NOT WORTH IT I got a egg Benedict with prosciutto it was $16 Crepe was $8.50   worst crepe i've had!! DO NOT COME HERE the service was also very slow"}
{"text":"After catching a film at TIFF, I decided to give this cafe another chance. (After exactly a year.)  We went in the late afternoon, and there was only a 5-10 minute wait. The waiter was sure to let us know our table was wrapping up and leaving shortly. What a change from my last experience.   I had the smoked salmon benedict on brioche. And my friends got the ham and swiss sandwich and the smoked salmon sandwich.   The eggs were poached perfectly and the brioche was nice and crispy. My salad was nicely dressed. I liked the potatoes, but it was a little dry. It could've used some sauce on the side.   I ordered a Earl Grey tea, thinking it would be the Kusmi Tea they advertised, but I got a Twinnings tea bag. Not sure if I had to specify or if they changed this practice. I would inquire next time.  We ended with their pastries, and we were not disappointed.   Oh, and I must mention that we saw a minor Canadian celebrity also having a coffee there. Pretty awesome!"}
{"text":"TLDR: Order the crepe classique! You will not regret it!  My boyfriend and I finally made the decision to try Le Neuf Cafe on a Sunday morning. We had been wanting to visit for brunch but knew we would likely be in for a long wait.   It was a weekend during TIFF and we wanted to grab some breakfast before heading out to King St to catch a celebrity sighting and see the festivities.   We were lucky it was a cloudy morning with some slight rain, as LNC only had one other couple ahead of us waiting for a table. We had about a 15 min wait which we didn't mind.  When we were seated, we fell in love with the interior. The beautiful bay window and Parisian design made us feel like we had stepped out of downtown Toronto and taken a seat at a cafe in Paris. It was an intimate and romantic venue.   We ordered the cafe mochas and were delighted at the delicious sweetness in a mug!   Being in a french cafe, we ordered the crepe classique for us both to eat on the side of our eggs benedict.   When the food came out, I was disappointed to see the hash browns on our plate looked like the plain frozen hash browns you can buy at the grocery store, although with the addition of peppers and onion. These were flavourless and dry. The eggs benedict were tasty but only had a tiny spoon of the creamy hollandaise sauce that you generally want to taste with every bite. These also were fairly bland and lacking flavour.   We had quite high expectations for the food and they did not hit the mark.  The crepe classique, however, was possibly the most delicious crepe I have ever eaten. It was a single crepe with icing sugar softly sprinkled on top. I wasn't sure if I needed syrup for this crepe but when I took my bite I realized there was a sugary texture biting into it. It was light and sweet and tasted like being in Montreal.   Unfortunately, the crepe costs $7 and at only one crepe, seems rather overpriced. If I ordered that alone, I'd leave with a happy tongue but an empty tummy.   Overall, the food was rather expensive and underwhelming. The crepe, mochas, and interior design were the best things about our experience. If we are to ever return it would likely only be for a crepe as a light snack.   -Ashley Marie"}
{"text":"Won't go here again, unfortunately. Took what seemed forever to get my latte and another customer had to holler to ask for the music volume to be turned down.  Owner was clearly more concerned with \"ambience\" than service and not on top of her good-looking staff, who were consumed with the task of polishing glasses. Shame, I was looking forward to supporting a small local business."}
{"text":"I love this local cafe. It's so quaint and it feels like you're in Paris. The servers are from Paris as well with adorable accents and personalities. Crepes are decent, desserts are delicious. I just love coming back here for a relaxing afternoon tea/coffee because of the atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Love at first sight! This cafe is like a time machine that takes you back to Paris. Once you step foot inside, you will instantly fall in love...a real love at first sight. From the smell of freshly baked croissants and baguettes, to the sounds of French being spoken by the friendly staff, Le Neuf Café captures nostalgia and rekindles flames.  Coup de foudre ! Ce café est comme une machine de temps qui va vous ramener à Paris. Une fois que vous mettrez les pieds vous serez instantanément tomber en amour...un vrai coup de foudre!"}
{"text":"Pardon the delayed (hence may not longer be completely accurate) review since I sat in at the newly opened cafe back in January.    It was blisteringly cold and we were supremely lucky to snatch one of the 3-4 tables - seating is at a premium in this place; the window seats and other tables-for-two were already snuggled into during the afternoon hour.  The place did seem rather barren and able to fit more tables (which they may have done since we were there).  There was actually a couple that came shortly after us that left empty-handed because they were unable to be accommodated.  However, it wasn't crowded and became rather nice.  The owner lady was evidently rushed and spread thin among all the walk-ins and coffee-making and phone calls.  She remained very courteous and prompt, and we even felt a little bad for disturbing her when it wasn't absolutely necessary.  Again, the store was barely opened a couple weeks I think, which probably explained the workers drilling behind the counter as we sat trying to chat over dessert and intermittent machinery noises.  I had a chocolate-mousse pistachio pear tart thing which started off delightful because - well, chocolate.  It quickly got too sweet and had a really tough bottom crust that I had to saw at with the dainty spoon.  My friend's banana cake was reportedly decent and we were both able to finish, although my mocha became rather tasteless after the overwhelming sweetness.    Somehow our bill of 2 mini cakes/tarts + americano + mocha came to $23 (pre-tip post-tax) - there were no detailed receipt system implemented yet and we overheard something about a sit-in fee versus simply takeout.    Despite the feel of a work-in-progress, the cafe held a pleasant and enjoyable French atmosphere.  In the future I would like to drop by just to compare the changes, and perhaps check out their first location.  (PS.  The bathroom lights had the coolest timed feature - you could choose a button depending on whether you needed the lights on for 5, 10, etc. minutes.  Never seen this before; neat!)"}
{"text":"Came here by accident, as I was to meet some relative and friends from out of town at the CN tower - they had dinner reservations at 360 - but we wanted to see them before then. We agreed to meet at a coffee shop. I used my trusted Yelp app, and it pointed to a couple of spots, Le Neuf was open, had many food item options, was intimate and was not too far.  Our table ordered: Different types of specialty coffees and the pastries 'du jour' I had a raspberry white chocolate pastry and it was excellent, as was my Cappuccino. Also had the french onion soup - which was rich and well portioned and the cheese platter. Our server was very pleasant and friendly. I'll be coming back with friends."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch on a visit to Toronto.  Lovely atmosphere, absolutely delicious food, good service, and free wifi (though it unfortunately wasn't working well when we were there).   What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I wrote a review for brunch now I'm writing about dinner. Last night was my first time having dinner there. I love everything about the inside of this small café from the art, to the furniture to the music!   My friend goes there often (he swears by there Americano which I've never had) and so we dropped in, in person around 4 pm to request a reservation for 2 for 7 pm that night. The waiter recognized my friend and took down his name.   When we arrived at 7 pm our table was ready for us. We ordered from the prix fixe Winter menu ($25/ each) for app, main, and dessert.   I had the lentil soup with a dollop of sour cream and it was yummy. My friend had the pork pâté with baguette crisps, butter, & delicious Dijon mustard which made the pâté taste deelish.   My main was the salmon almandine in a lemon butter sauce with fries and a small side of ratatouille (roasted veggies the French are famous for). My salmon was lemony and ever so slightly over cooked but still yummy. She brought us mayonnaise & ketchup on request to dip our fries in   My friend ordered the flank steak which also came w/French fries and sautéed onions. It was a bit chewy but flavorful. He liked my salmon better.   For dessert we got one chocolate mousse with real whip cream and one crême brûlée. Portion was small but that's probably a good thing as we were full! Both were decent and nice to finish the meal with something sweet.   Considering one main alone was $21-24, the prix fixe menu was a good deal. But I think the a la carte menu's steak is a lot better cut than the flank steak (purely a guess on my part). Something to keep in mind. We were starving so we were thinking the more food the better."}
{"text":"Absolute favourite brunch spot in Toronto. Cute, Parisian style with quirky service and fantastic food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I visited this place for lunch previously. It was pretty good. I decided to check out their brunch. When we arrived the host was warm and accommodating. I chose from the savoury crepe menu, Le Montagnarde. It was okay. It was a bit uninspired to be honest. It was a toasted buckwheat crepe, grated chedder cheese, a fried egg and bacon. You could tell it was left on the salamander for a long time. The cheese was congealing and the fried egg was heat damaged.   That really wasn't the worst part.  My sister ordered a florentine eggs benedict.  It came out without any hollandaise on it. The server assured me it would be a couple of minutes. He completely forgot. The eggs sat without sauce for 20 minutes even after I reminded him two times. When the sauce was finally ready, I asked him to replace the dish since it died waiting for him. He told me that he wouldn't do that since the sauce would warm it up. AND if I didn't like it at the end he would reduce the price. I told him I didn't like that idea. I asked if he would want cold eggs. He never replaced it because he was worried he'd get in trouble, but he did offer to give me \"something else for free\". Which was nice of him I guess.  My sister is too nice to complain, but I was a bit angry at the treatment. I gave him a bad tip. 15%. Hopefully they'll get their shit together and train their staff on how to deal with complaints. Until then, I give this place a pass. (even for the entertainment district)"}
{"text":"Just the best café French style West of Paris and in Toronto. Best coffee hot chocolate and croissants. Staff especially Fouzia the lovely owner are there to please. Wonderful little cozy place. I will book for dinner soon. Leo. S."}
{"text":"not sure what happened, but that was the worst croque madame I've ever had anytime/where. it tasted like it came out of the fridge. the bread was so stale I couldn't cut through it.  coffee was good. decor is tasteful."}
{"text":"The best way to describe this place is it's a \"little cozy French nook\" in the city. I went to there today for lunch. Since it's a friendly seat yourself environment I was able to secure a cozy two seater near a large immaculate mirror. The Decor at this place was quite charming. I ordered a latte and asked the friendly cute waiter with French accent what would he recommend? He said since he is from France his favourite Crepe from the 9 choices in the menu is Nutella and Strawberry Crepe.  And boy was he right! The hot Crepe with the Hot Latte ended up being a great combination and took my taste buds straight to heaven! I am definitely coming back here again!!"}
{"text":"I was passing by to visit the renovated park on Clarence square and I notice a trendy Parisian cafe. The minute I entered the cafe I fell like I was in  Montmartre,Paris. From the menu to the interior design and even the staff. I was there for lunch and I had the lobster soup,( deliciously creamy) salmon quiche (just melt in my mouth) and crepe Suzette(perfectly sweet) for dessert!   Adorable atmosphere and definitely not my last visit. It is surely a hit for toronto!"}
{"text":"Soooo good. This cute cafe is beyond charming. Even the entire staff is French. We had...whatever, who cares. It was delicious. (I only had pastries from the case, not a sit down meal)."}
{"text":"I read all the good reviews of this place, so I made a special trip after work to visit.  First of all, the service is poor. No one greet me when I walked in the shop. The owner (the lady) passed by me as if didn't see me. Fine, she may be busy with other things. Then the only server came out from kitchen to greet me after a few minutes.  There are not many pastry left. I picked the almond croissant which is highly recommended. I specially asked the server if the croissant is freshly made in store and what time. He told me they are baked twice daily at 7am and 2nish in the afternoon. I have a high expectation because it costs me $3.6! It is pretty pricy and better be good.   I had a bite and it was hard as a rock. I can't believe it is bake in the same day or it must be baked with poor ingredients. It is much worse then those chained bakery. Moreover, The almond filling is too sweet.   I know my money is wasted."}
{"text":"Tired? Hungover? Sick from a long night? Need a place to hit up in the morning which can provide you with a sound breakfast?  Weakling.   Well whatever the case is, Le Neuf Cafe is a great way to start your day. They have an amazing brunch, beautiful outdoor seating and great hospitality. The staff and owner are super friendly.  The food here is great and fills you up. You can survive half a day on a baguette alone.   Located right in Clarence Square it's a great way to enjoy a lovely day when it's nice outside."}
{"text":"I tried out Le Neuf Cafe this summer when Paypal was promoting their mobile app. They had a coffee week where you could receive $5 off from a bunch of different cafes if you used the app. Le Neuf Cafe is a Parisian cafe that is perfect for any brunch date. All the employees there speak French, to ensure that you receive a great Parisian experience (and it's also a great place for bilinguals to work at!).  Overall, I really like the concept of Le Neuf Cafe because I don't know of many Parisian/French cafes in Toronto. It's such a cute place to catch up with girlfriends or sit down on the patio (during the summer) for a lunch break."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!!! Cute little Parisian style restaurant! A bit smaller than I expected, but love the quaint atmosphere. Interior design is so lovely and servers are super friendly.  Had a ratatouille crepe. It was nicely prepared and it looks like they use buckwheat for the actual crepe part. Was perfectly seasoned too! Not too salty like most restaurants prepare their food. Coffee is a bit on the stronger side. And they have a huge selection of desserts. Must try next time!"}
{"text":"The most amazing food we have had in Canada. The owner was super cool and suggested so many cool spots in the city. Also she went out of her way to accommodate us with breakfast even though the breakfast menu was over with. We had the veggie omelette and the veggie baguette with a berry crepe for dessert. All amazing!! Highly recomand Le neufe'."}
{"text":"Oops, another one I forgot to review.  This tiny, cozy cafe is a wonderful stop for brunch (available on weekends only). We received very good service, despite it being crowded and busy. There was a group of ~7 happily waiting in the hallway for a seat. I'd suggest if you're more than 3 people to try and make a reservation, though I don't know their policy regarding this.  Seating is very cramped, we practically shared a table with another couple.  We both ordered an eggs Benedict. He ordered the Florentine and I ordered the Norwegian, both on brioche. I would definitely reccommend the brioche over the regular English Muffin (lol, it's a French cafe!). I also ordered a latte, which was spectacular. We rounded the meal out with a dessert - the Chouquette. I was pleasantly surprised that the baked goods were being churned out of the kitchen constantly! I also remember getting a little something sweet with our bill, but I can't remember what...perhaps a cream puff?  I would highly recommend this place for brunch but be prepared to rub elbows and wait :)"}
{"text":"3.5   The decoration is very 1960s Paris.  Staff is young, likely from the suburbs of Paris (and Marseilles) but devoted and invested in their work.  However, it's surprising how many of them seem to be just roaming about, letting only one cover the service -- the result can be slow service.  Clientele is predicably acting on the pretentious side for this type of place.    Coffee and 70% hot chocolate were very good and well executed.  Almond croissant (all baked goods are brought in) are decadent but not airy enough in texture. Croissants are OK but with the same texture issue.   Deal breaker:  at 9am on a week-end we took out a Baguette to go and found it was still frozen on the inside!  (but also not airy either)"}
{"text":"Cute little French spot in Clarence Square! If I didn't have the address, I would totally have missed it - it's nestled in a row of townhouses.  Small, charming and cosy, and with decor and furniture that will make you feel like you're in Paris!  We were fortunate and got seated right away, but others definitely had to wait.  If you can, get a spot by the window!  I had the eggs Benedict with smoked salmon and was really pleased with my meal, and especially with the generous serving of salmon!  They serve coffees of various types and for the tea lovers, they have a box of tisanes (Kusmi of course!)  The staff is French, which adds to the atmosphere.  There was only one person waiting on tables and the same gent did the drinks, so service was a tad slow, and the server forgot our pain au chocolat.  That said, I found the spot charming and if ever I'm in the King and Spadina area, I'd consider it again!"}
{"text":"Le Neuf is a dainty little cafe right in the busiest part of the city.  Everything around it is busy but somehow they manage to avoid the noise and the crowd and allows their customers to relax and enjoy the sun.  Their location is definitely a little hard to find if it's your first time.  It blends in with the row of townhouses on Clarence Sq.  They have a very adorable furry host by the name of Sophie.  She likes to wander around the patio to say hello to everyone.  I had their fruit tart pastry and also their smoke salmon crepe.  needless to say i spend quite some time there and it was great to be able to catch up with a friend while munching on good food."}
{"text":"I went here over the weekend, I had seen it last year when I was in town and was impressed. Last year I stopped in for a coffee and dessert. This time however, I went and had breakfast - the 3 eggs and bacon. Wonderful! The eggs were nice and fluffy and had a great taste, by far the nest place in the city I have had eggs. The potatoes were a perfect match to the plate.  If you sit outside you are looking across at a green park and if you look up you can see the CN Tower. I will definitely be going here again and would highly recommend it. Go early, cause it could fill up on a weekend. I was there on a Sunday from 9-10am and it was fine."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I stumbled upon this tiny restaurant hidden in what looks like fancy townhouses. The restaurant was packed when we arrived, so we ordered to go. I ordered the Parisien ($9), which is a baguette with ham, swiss, dijon, arugula, and pickles. If you order to go, you don't get the side salad :( The baguette was amazingly good because it tasted fresh. The desserts in the dessert display looked very tempting. My co-workers ordered the almond croissant and said it was really good. I was eyeing the Paris-Brest. The wait-staff speak French, so you know it's authentic :)  Would I come back? Definitely. I'll stay next time for the side salad."}
{"text":"Great food and people are nice but either they are overextended or the servers are dimwits! Constantly forgetting to bring stuff. Coffee with no milk or sugar and when you ask for it they bring only milk and then you ask for it again....  Both times i went for brunch I had the same experience with two different servers!"}
{"text":"Was just here with two friends last night for a belated birthday celebration.  This place is just as I remember it. Lovely atmosphere, with delish french fare.  There was, however, a blunder on the server's part towards the end of the meal.  You are now wondering WHY I've given them another 5-star rating?  Because the server's reaction to curb the error was the an example of brilliant customer service. It was the perfect recovery.  Here's what happened:  We had ordered way too much food. We each enjoyed a separate appetizer (pate, steak tartare, and mushroom feuillette), so by the time our (equally delicious) entrees arrived - we could only eat a third- or half of the plates. After a while, we just asked for the bill, and for our entrees to be packed up. The server took the plates away, and then settled our individual bills. However, she had not heard our request to pack away our entrees, and by the time she returned to the kitchen, our food had been tossed out.  She came back to our table - completely apologetic and took responsibility for the blunder. And she had the kitchen cook up new (albeit smaller portions) dishes for us! We each had a different main, and we each got a fresh portion.  Super impressed with the turn of events and her seamless recovery."}
{"text":"Very friendly service Great food and a wide selection of tea available Everything made fresh with amazing ingredients"}
