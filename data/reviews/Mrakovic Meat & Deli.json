{"text":"Great place if you want some cevaps."}
{"text":"I am from Croatia and am always looking to  try to find places like this to buy things to remind me of home. This is a wonderful little place that is full of a variety of different things from meats, teas, and candies. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is a little Croatian gem found in the west side of Toronto, surrounded by residential properties, so it may be a little tricky to find. From the outside it looks like a convenience store. 

When you walk in the place, don't be alarmed that it is a small supermarket that sells all Croatian products/brands, it also has a butcher section. To get to the resturant, you will have to walk all the way to the end. They do have a decent mount of seating space to sit and enjoy your hot food.

Please note, the business does not run standard hours, they close at 6pm on a Saturday and will run out of popular food by that time.

The price is reasonable and I love there Cevapi meal. However, their meats are a little on salty side, you will feel the thirst after, but I definately will go back."}
{"text":"If you like cevapi and Burek, you need to try Mrakovic's food! I love their cevapi and cheese burek, and have ordered it to go many times. Unlike Royal Meats, they are reasonably priced ($10 for 10 cevapi, bread and kajmak). 

They have a nice selection of food that you can order to go, or to eat in their small seating area. (It is like a small diner or cafe). They have cevapi, hamburgers, burek and other Bosnian foods. 

You can also buy 50 or 100 cevapi that are frozen for barbecuing at home. This is a great option if you are having a family barbecue."}
{"text":"Best Bosnian food around
I come here and I order a large portion of ?evapi for dine-in, and then take some burek for home. What would I do without this place"}
{"text":"Delicious burek! This place has been bookmarked for a while now. Next time I will try the cevaps - everyone was ordering this. Definitely a hidden gem of this area."}
{"text":"Cevapi was super delicious but I have had better elsewhere. I'll still be coming back for more since it's so close!"}
{"text":"Went here and got a lamb chop meal. 
Very tasty and cheap.  
I want to try the smoked sausages next time..."}
{"text":"Always great quality of food here, i said many times the best ?evap?i?i in north america!:)"}
{"text":"This place is really tasty.  I met a friend for lunch here today.  I was probably an early one because I ordered Chevapi which seems like a house specialty but it takes about 15 minutes to cook.  People come and go quickly.  They have this stew that looked really good and something called Burek in spinach and cheese which kind of reminds me of Greek spinach pie and a meat version.  It's super low key and really delicious."}
{"text":"Soon after I got back from a long trip to Croatia, I found this place by accident. Naturally, I burst through the doors yelling DOBRE DAN! Pretty obnoxious, but I was excited.

I was missing cevapi and the mountain of ajvar I usually ate it with, so I went ahead and ordered that here. It was so, so good. Super tender and flavourful meat. I also ordered some burek, but that was underwhelming... Kind of dry and crusty.

Otherwise, the rest of the place is a mini grocery store with a large deli meat counter. Great spot!"}
{"text":"One of the best cevape in Toronto.  
For around $10 you get 10 cevepa, a lepinja (bun) and a small portion of .
The cevape are smaller than in other places, but the quality of the meat is definitely worth the price.  

I have also ordered 100 cevapa for a party before and everone was very happy with the results."}
{"text":"You do not know that the Bosniaks make such nice meatballs. Soft meat, Excellent taste, Wonderful presentation
I advise"}
{"text":"For someone from the former Yugoslavia, this place is a dream come true in Toronto. 
Not only does it act as a small grocery store with products from back home, but it also has a restaurant section. Mind you, the place is small. The restaurant has four booths, I believe, and two more side tables. And it gets BUSY on the weekends. 

That being said, the food is absolutely fantastic. They have amazing cevapi, a Bosnian staple, and everything else I have tried has been good too. Truth be told, it is hard to eat much else when the cevapi are just a god-send. 

The grocery section is pretty well stocked and you can find most thing you need. Additionally, they have a decently sized deli section, where you can get good quality meats and cheeses. 
If you are from the former Yugoslavia or have friends who want to experience the food from there, this is the place. The location may be a bit out of the way, but the trip will be well worth it!"}
{"text":"First time I try Bosnian food (I think it's Bosnian...) and I'm obsessed. Such simple, yet delicious sandwiches! It's located inside what looks like a sketchy convenience store."}
