{"text":"So pleased with my evening here. The ambience at The Yard is delightful. The food at Barrio is excellent- very fresh, authentic yet contemporary. For example- I had the Enchiladas Urbanas which had excellent tomatillo sauce, and had an unexpected sprinkling of pine nuts. The cochinita pibil featured melt in your mouth pork. Our server was very attentive and offered to refill my water several times. In addition, other staff stopped by to see how we were faring. Yes the prices were a higher than standard Mexican fare, but I felt it was reasonable given the location, inspired menu and quality of the ingredients used.  If you are into fine tequila and mescal, they have a great selection. If you're not there yet, here's an opportunity to expand your horizons!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner with my husband I ordered enchiladas urbanas they were so gross, my husband ordered Menudo but the waiter came back to our table 15 minutes later and said they ran out of the Menudo yesterday  (so I guess that means things aren't mage fresh that day) ok so he ordered cochinita pibill he said it was ok. Never got a drink refill. Service was not good and you have to vallet Park. Worst $56.00 ever spent. :("}
{"text":"Very cool restaurant. In the same location as culinary dropout.  traditional mexican food but infused high quality. Afforable but not cheap. Great for a date style or small group."}
{"text":"Food is not authentic, prices are very high. The atmosphere was very nice I will say however the food was so bland. Definitely paying for the area and not the food. I don't recommend this place to people that truly know what authentic Mexican food taste like. You will be disappointed.  I would do a taco Tuesday with some beer."}
{"text":"So far the chips are stale which is a huge NO NO for any Mexican restaurant. Let's see what else unfolds....suuuupppoeeerrrr slow service. Food very slow to come out m.   Waiter was doing his best but ol Sylvia needs to reorganize  Overall blah"}
{"text":"A Valentines Dinner should always be a special occasion. Bad experiences on special occasions can really upset customers which could lead to a loss of cliental. Barrio Urbano, was an extraordinary experience for my wife and I on 2/14/16. The menu was simplified for us at Barrio Urbano, to provide only the chefs finest dishes that day. Guacamole was made on the spot, and had a special touch with pomegranate in it. Our enchiladas were beyond amazing. I eat Mexican food on a daily basis, being of Mexican descent but to be absolutely swooped off my feet by Barrio Urbano's enchiladas says a lot about the skills and talent these recipes contain. Sensational work on part of all the staff. Only the finest and freshest ingredients are used at Barrio Urbano. Its an overall delight to eat at this place and I completely recommend Barrio Cafe for any occasion. Thank you Barrio Urbano for giving us an amazing Valentine's Day Dinner."}
{"text":"My personal favorite of all Taco Tuesday places!  Great selections with designated gluten free Taco options!  Perfection does get any better than this!"}
{"text":"Just had the \"new tacos\" they were super awesome also had a margarita made with 'fresh juice\" yum, perfect start to the weekend!      The last time I had the spinach enchiladas for dinner, they were fabulous! The dish was spicy, but, perfect for me!  Love the food here!!"}
{"text":"After reading the bio on the chef, I had to check it out  Wait Staff:  5 Stars --  Ethan, excellent service (based on other reviews, we must have caught them on a good day) Bartender:  4 Stars -- My companion and I had a margaritas, not a fan of the 'simple syrup', but he made it work.  They use a decent tequila for HH.  Food: 2 Stars Guacamole:  I consider this a tell-tale sign of a good Mexican restaurant.  I mean it's just avocados and a few other ingredients...right.  They prepare it table side, which is cool but, the guac is basically tomatoes...lots of tomatoes, onions, jalapeno, cilantro, with some avocado  tossed in.  They add 'pomegranate' for color I guess. The chips were greasy as well.    QUESADILLA de JAIBA (crab and corn quesadillas) : First of all I was incredibly disappointed in the fact that the tortillas are 'store bought'.  No way those tortillas are hand made.  In fact the item looked and tasted like something from the freezer section of a grocery store.  The flavors were just all over the place; bland mushy crab, sweet corn, over-cooked cheese...a mess.  It didn't even look appetizing.   Tacos:  Probably one of the better items on the menu.  Looked and tasted pretty good.  I guess my point is this....if you are going to break away from traditional Mexican recipes, you got to make it work, visually and with flavor.  Just didn't taste award winning food here.  I would go back just for drinks at HH.  $15 (regular price) for a margarita (short glass) is insane, unless I'm sitting on a beach in a hut somewhere watching some waves, while getting spritzed with scented water every 15 minutes by a cabana boy!"}
{"text":"We came here with family while visiting Phoenix, AZ to try some authentic Mexican street food. First I ordered a porter beer called seed panther. That was really good. Rich and flavorful with chocolate notes. Then we got a while bunch of apps and small plates. The guacamole was made table side and the twist was that it had pomegranate seeds in it which was a pleasant surprise. It added a sweet note but still tasted like a very good guacamole. Next we got the chile con queso. I didn't really get much chili but the cheese sauce was delicious. It was a mix of different cheeses that was part think sauces and also stretchy like melted mozzarella but not mozzarella. I couldn't stop eating it. The esquites asados was a nice Mexican take on fries. Nothing plain about them as they were typed with grilled corn, cheese spicy sauce and much more. The apps can be quite filling so just keep that in mind when going for dinner. The entrees were large as well. I ordered the Torta de Asada. It was a huge sandwich with steak and a huge slice of bacon that looked like it was sticking it's tongue out at me as if it was taunting me \"you can't finish me\". And it was right, I couldn't. I had to bring him, err it, home.  This place isn't really an indoor spot. E entire restaurant was exposed to the outside environment even though you was surrounded by walls and a ceiling. So keep that in mind when coming her at night time during winter months. We were pretty cold sitting \"inside\". The Yard is in the same establishment and that night a live band was playing and you could clearly hear them in Barrio. It's a fun noisy environment with games and a picture booth. Go there with friends to hang out and have a good time."}
{"text":"The start off to our evening was a little rough. The rest of the building was closed down due to a private party so the overflow was directed here. Due to the uncommon traffic on a Monday night the servers were slightly overwhelmed. Once it was made known we were slightly neglected our server Nick was all about making up for the start of our evening. He came out to our table \"manned up\" for the oversight and went out of his way to change our experience. We will definitely be back and a huge shout out to Nick the man!! A big thank you!!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious! Ramon is an exceptional bartender! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I was there for brunch last Sunday.  The food was ok but there was nothing unique to it, just the basic breakfast.  I was expecting at least a couple of dishes that were unique and authentic to only the restaurant.  I had the chorizo and pappas.  Serving was small."}
{"text":"Saw the chef in this mornings news, food looked wonderful so we hopped in our bikes and rode 3 miles to try the new addition at The Yard. We are big Culinary Dropout and Little Cleo's fans, so we wanted to give the new spot a try.   All the tables were full at the time for our party of 3, so we told the hostess where we would be and I asked if she would be able to find us as we were going to play ping-pong. She seemed very confused and said it would be a 15 minute wait and she didn't appear to be taking names.   As a line grew, I saw her seat another party of 3, so I went to check and mentioned we were next on the no list-list. She said she sat them at the bar and thought that we wanted a table. We weren't even given the option! Then she came back to us and said its going be a 30 minute additional wait. Well you lost me there....  Need a new hostess and some sort of semblance of organization."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst service I have ever experienced!   While on a trip to Phoenix, I met friends at The Yard. We decided to eat at Barrio Urbano, and were very disappointed! To say that the server was inattentive is an understatement. We ordered 2 beers and after 20 minutes and 3 reminders, he finally brought them to the table. We waited over an hour (after the delivery of our beers) for our food. It is frustrating when you have to get up and find your server just to order another beer or ask for a cup of coffee! It is hard to imagine why this restaurant does not make changes in the way food is prepared and delivered.  The food was mediocre at best. I ordered the pork tacos and did enjoy the grilled pineapple with it, which was a nice flavor combination. But at $13.00 it seems like very little consolation. The rest of the dishes at the table were bland and uninteresting. The guacamole is tasty, especially with the pomegranate included, but the chunks are hard to eat with the chips. Can someone mash the avocado a bit? Please don't waste your time and money at this place!"}
{"text":"This is a cool place in a great location. I've been a few times and really, really want to say good things but I just can't. The main problem is the service or lack thereof. The second is the food. They are trying but just aren't there yet.  The drinks are good and they try at making them special. But on two different visits I had their Bloody Mary. The first was great with appropriate spices and garnish. The second visit it was undrinkable. There must have been half a glass of hot sauce and maybe a 1/8th oz of vodka, no garnishes. Everyone at the table tried it and heads exploded. Sent them back but the bartender refused to remake them.   Of course, this was after the waiter spilled two Bloody Mary's and a margarita in my lap. Took about 10 minutes for the first round and another 10 minutes for the second. He said of course he would comp the drinks but still charged us for them. Had to explain to him that we wouldn't pay for the spilled drinks and what comp in the replacement drinks meant. He thought not charging us for the spilled drinks was a comp. Had to ask for napkins for cleanup, had to ask for silverware...had to ask for everything.   I had the breakfast burrito and it was dry. Only eggs and sausage or whatever meat they include, no salsa, no cheese. I queried the waiter and he went and checked but said that is the way they make them.  My dining companion had the chilaquiles on two separate occasions. The first time they were excellent. The second time they did not resemble anything like the first, smaller portion, less presentation, dry and bland.   I love Sylvia's Barrio Cafe but she needs to spend more time and attention on her newest place. I can't justify a return visit yet."}
{"text":"Barrio Urbano is fabulous!  Had lunch there (today is their Day 3!) with two colleagues who had each made New Years resolutions to try new foods.  We all loved our lunches!   The atmosphere is funky and welcoming.   The menu is chef-driven and different from any other Mexican restaurant in the Valley.  The food is fresh, colorful, creative (who can resist \"breakfast 'til 3?!!) and -- most of all -- delicious.    Are you still reading this?? You should be on your way there already!!!!!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is FANTASTIC! My group ate breakfast here on Sunday morning after a long night out and LOVED it. This restaurant brings a innovative touch on traditional dishes. The staff seated us promptly and we stared the meal off with the make your own mimosa  option along with some delicious Bloody Mary's.  We all ordered different items and loved them all. We had one small mix up with the toast and the restaurant manager Ray came by to fix it himself. The staff here is very friendly, professional, knowledgeable, the food is fantastic , and the environment is relaxing.  I recommend the posole and molletes with an egg overeasy on top. This is my new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here 100 times and I still love it, especially because they're consistent. Chorizo con papas, the saudero burrito, az burrito, spicy fries and the carne asada tacos are some of my favorite things to eat here. The O G is a great cocktail if you like tequila, if not the sangria is too legit to quit. I enjoy the atmosphere of the place, very chill. The staff here is top notch, very kind, responsive and always take good care of their customers, but I have to say Yvette is my absolute favorite. She's the best! I'll definitely keep coming here"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast today. It was their third day open..Great little spot at \"The Yard\" on 7th street between Camelback and Bethany Home.   Showed up just before 8am and was greeted warmly by the friendly hostess as she was cleaning the windows. I was shown to a table in the small restaurant, which affords everyone a view of the open kitchen. Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza herself was behind the line with the cooks. The waitstaff was friendly and knowledgable, if somewhat nervous. Chef Silvana made her way out into the dining room and talked with the customers.  At the Chef's recommendation, I tried the Fruita a la Tijuana and the Chilaquiles. The fruit can only be described as a bowl for fresh explosion in your mouth. The menu description for it reads \"mixed fruit of the day, topped with cottage cheese, Arizona Crockett honey, sunflower seeds, golden raisins, and housemade granola.\" The fruit does change daily, depending on what is fresh and seasonal. Today it was pineapple, strawberries, pomegranite, papaya?, and I believe mango, along with the other goodies. This was a great dish and much less sweet than most places fruit/yogurt parfait. I also had the Chiliquiles. It reads as \"corn tortilla chips topped with chili verde, an egg any style, cotija cheese, jojoque crema, and fresh avocado.\" It is served with a side of delicious black beans. The dish was very flavorful and spicy, but not overly so. A great balance of flavor without being hot just to be hot. The avocado was slices of a perfectly ripe fruit which helps to balance out the dish as well.   I have long been a fan of Barrio Cafe. Now I can add Barrio Urbano to my list of favorites. As a big fan of breakfast spots, I have taken some off my list this past year because they were inconsistent and just going thru the motions. If today was any example (especially after just 3 days open), Barrio Urbano is hitting on all cylinders."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this this place. A great place to go for brunch on Saturday or Sunday. Daniel, our waiter was extremely polite and helpful. The food is absolutely amazing, always fresh, and the taste is to be determined by you. I love everything on the menu. As I said before, this place is great!"}
{"text":"Went here for their awesome happy hour. Ordered a great margarita for $6 and it was delicious, one of the best I have gotten. Our sever/host Ivette was fantastic. The service was outstanding, she made us feel like we were family! The Barrio Pollo Burrito is to die for, order it! One of the best places around. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Popped over for appetizers and had a few drinks. Love the ambiance the posole hit the spot and had just enough spice to it.  Cocktails were good, extensive tequila list. Gotta make it over here for breakfast/brunch looks real tasty.  Honestly, I'm a sucker for anything Silvana does, she's such a treasure."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks and had an excellent time! The tequila selection is fantastic, and the unique decor really adds something to the laid-back, urban atmosphere of The Yard. I will definitely be coming here again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had the opportunity to dine in and have dinner this past Sunday on January 14, and I must say we were pleasantly surprised with the quality of service and food. Even though it was quite busy, that did not affect the quality if service! Definitely going to go back. There was so much to choose from the menu so we definitely need to go back!"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try Chef Silvana's food for quite some time. So we finally decided to go and we picked barrio Urbano... a soon we walked in we were happily greeted by Ivette, she was very helpful and made us feel at home...we ordered esquites asados to start. Very tasty.. for our main course we had Enchiladas urbanas and Cochinita pibil. The food was great. Well excecuted.if that wasn't enough, we order the churro with ice-cream for dessert and let me tell you I've had more upscale dessert than this and they are  not even half as good as the churro well done.. They did a great job overall.. little on the warm side.. .. our first time here and we will be back soon .."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on Taco Tuesday to celebrate his birthday. The atmosphere is really fun. Being connected to an outdoor area filled with activities like fooz-ball, ping-pong, fire pits, etc. makes the energy great. For starters we ordered the guac which is made right in front of you and includes pomegranate seeds. Before you knock that idea, try it. It was surprisingly good! The tacos were delish. I had the two vegetarian options and my husband tried many of the meat based ones. We loved all of them and found everything very tasty. We ordered the house margs and were mildly satisfied. They weren't spectacular in any way and tasted a lot like Jose Cuervo mix from the grocery store. We didn't try any of the specialty drinks. The service was very good.  Both of us agreed that we would visit again, but only on Taco Tuesday when the tacos are half price. ($2 instead of $4) Otherwise, the meal would have been really expensive since between the 2 of us, we consumed about 10 tacos and could have had at least 4 more."}
{"text":"I was disappointed and I didn't want to be. Although the atmosphere was amazing the service needs help. We had to flag down someone after sitting for 15 minutes just to get water. We then had to flag someone else down to take our order for drinks which then took another 20 minutes. A few people at a table next to us left which I will assume was due to the long wait. It would have been nice to have at least been acknowledged for the slow service and to thank us for patiently waiting but that never came. The food was good but it was hard to love it after waiting so long."}
{"text":"Very delicious tacos on Taco Tuesday! The simple margarita was on point! Service was great! You are going to pay more (about $2) for theses \"Street Taco\" size tacos, but they are worth it-which is the only negative about this place. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"Brought my mom in for lunch the other day since she had never been, I convinced her to try something different - she normally gets whatever has chicken in it - she had the Quesadilla de Camaron which she really liked (one step closer to favorite son). Of course I had to steal a bite, the sautéed shrimp was seasoned and cooked perfectly. I had the Arizona Burrito; the pork chile verde was delicious and the salsa verde added another layer of amazing flavor."}
{"text":"We arrived for breakfast and were delighted to see 5 empty tables. Then we were told we couldn't sit down because , per the manager, \"they were reserved.\"  We waited 20 minutes in line with others and the tables remained empty. No one was seated in them for an entire hour. It seems crazy to operate a restaurant with empty tables. Meanwhile the wait staff and chef worked their magic. The food and service were over the top. I will return. But note to owner- this is a place that could run itself. A manager who stands around looking at an iPad is a manager you don't need. Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.  Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on Friday night.  The Yard was packed and very lively with games and live music - great atmosphere.  Culinary Dropout would have seated us in 20 minutes, but Barrio had tables open right away.  We chose Barrio, but I think it was a bad sign that it was only 1/3 full.   The service was good and timely, but the food was not so great.  The beef in my tacos was tough with lots of gristle, and the tacos were bland.  I could have easily made better at home.  They get 3 stars because the Margarita was quite tasty."}
{"text":"Horrible. Went to celebrate my husbands birthday. It was him, my newborn babygirl, and I. Waited for 20 mins then a cleaning guy came and took our centerpiece because he said it was for a previous party and just looked at us. We asked for a waiter and finally got water and chips. Waiter seemed arrogant and judgy. Like we weren't good customers. He was tall light skined and had a pink polo. We ordered. Food was excellent.  Then he brought us the bill assuming we were done. Didn't even ask if we wanted dessert. Horrible service. I went prepared to be pampered. To splurge and celebrate my husbands birthday and have a good time. But instead left feeling almost descriminated against, forgotten and like I was a burden to them. I've been to Barrio Cafe several times and love it. But Barrio Urbano wasn't even worth getting in the car for. McDonald's would've been a better choice in service. Better get better staff or that place will tank."}
{"text":"Way overpriced. Tacos are super small and way greasy. Salad with chicken for 12 should have more than a few ounces of chicken. Salsas had to be requested which is silly when you're paying 12 for mediocre guacamole.  $24 SPECIAL of enchiladas better be special. We used to love the Barrios. I stopped going to airport after paying more than $20 for glass of wine. Thought it was just an airport ripoff but obviously it's the business model now. Too bad. Too many other good restaurant choices."}
{"text":"Looking for a way to avoid the long wait at Barrio Cafe? STOP! This is exactly the kind of toxic thinking that will bring you to try Barrio Urbana, Barrio Cafe's ugly bastard child.   The enchiladas and quesadillas were oozing with a salty, otherwise tasteless filling of extra creamy cheese. The wait staff was bored and inattentive. Oh and I nearly paid Barrio Cafe prices. I'm embarrassed and confused at why this restaurant shares the Barrio name. I can't say enough good things about the original location, but sadly this experience leaves me feeling that my Barrio loyalty has been taken advantage of.  That being said the Yard complex has a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"OVERPRICED! Came here last night,excited to check this place out... Nothing like getting undercooked bacon wrapped around a chili with ZERO crab meat. Menu said\"lump of crab meat.\" The staff looked like they were bored To death oof! Not a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Total shit show. Tacos are ersatz Mexican and totally mediocre. I have had far better and more authentic tacos at the numerous taquerias in Brooklyn, NY where I live.  My wife ordered the cochinita pibil. How was it? $20 for the exact same stew that you find in the tacos but for $18 more ($2 taco night). It wasn't terrible but it wasn't all that good. Everything seemed half-assed, service included. Brittney seemed friendly to start, but she snarled when I didn't complete the taco form using a pencil. But weirdly no pencil was provided. Also, weirdly, no silverware was provided when we received our food. Can I add that that the slaw and the guacamole I ordered also wasn't provided before, with, or even after we got our tacos? Thanks, thought I could. Also weird. The final straw was having the check plopped unceremoniously on our table without our asking for it. Not cool, Brittany. This place is just eh, all about perpetrating marginal \"Mexican\" food and a pseudo famous chef. Don't believe the hype. Come to Brooklyn and I'll show you some real Mexican food."}
{"text":"The food at Barrio Urbano is pretty good, but it isn't up to par with the original Barrio.  Also, the quality is inconsistent over the two times we've dined here.    The real problem here is the service.  The waiters don't always seem to know what's going on and seem confused and forgetful.  We ordered our drinks, and I asked for a water in addition to our other drinks.  Water never came and I had to ask 2 different people 4 times to get that water.  We ordered guacamole (the best guac in town), but our entrees came out 20 minutes later.  Our server was nowhere to be found, so I had to ask another server why we didn't receive our appetizer before our meal.  She offered to make it right then at the table, but instead our server brought the cart over and made it after another 5 minutes.    The food was all good, but we only saw our server once during our meal.  When we finally got our bill, our server ran my card but forgot to bring the receipt to be signed.  It was another 10 minutes before we could find him to get the receipt and be on our way.    The staff just seems too inexperienced/young to even handle the job of serving guests in an adequate manner.  I will be back for the food, but hope that the restaurant starts implementing some service standards with its staff."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast.  3rd time.  Probably won't go back.  The food was just ok.  We arrived at 9:00 am for breakfast, they weren't ready.  Had to wait for coffee, and our food was room temperature.  I think the only item that was freshly made were the eggs.  The server was very friendly, but she and the cook were the only staff there.  You would have thought they would have been more prepared for the day.  Oh well!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the freshly made guacamole! My wife and I both ordered burritos. I ordered the Arizona Burrito. The pork was delicious and the tortilla was a fresh homemade blanket of goodness! The salsa verde was a little spicy for me, but I still managed to eat half of the burrito and still have enough for leftovers. My wife ordered the carnitas burrito which came with a delicious pico and nice steak flavor. She loved it, but stated the brisket burrito is even better! I loved the freshness of the food and quality of the ingredients. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the hostess was delightful, The bloody Mary's were bloody awful and  the service was horrible. The server on Jan 12th, generally avoided us, never smiled, and was very unapproachable.  Not a place to go with larger groups."}
{"text":"Love it, love it, love it!!! And this statement doesn't come close to the actual experience!!! Everyone Must try La Mula... its a Spanish twist to the Moscow mule! Delicioso!!!! Ask for a shot of the German tequila..... Phenomenal!!!!! There is live music here which I can't wait to listen too. Great service and a definite place to try and get the experience of the overall ambience!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Chicago & so many people recommended this place. Good portions, MOUTH WATERING food & drinks. You can sit on the patio and play games (jenga, bags/corn hole). This is my favorite place we've been all weekend. It's a a great vibe for a weekend date or dinner with the girls. Did I mention amazing service?"}
{"text":"When you have to stop the waiter and ask for a glass of water, you know the meal is not going to go well.  The food was uninspired: under-seasoned, underwhelming. The only saving grace of the meal was the guacamole, but even that lacked even a scintilla of uniqueness.  Our waiter was relatively attentive, but especially as slow as the restaurant was I expected far better service.   Barrio Urbano was half the meal I expected at twice the price. I love the Yard, but I will not return to this disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place for Mother's Day breakfast.  We had a pretty large group.  Its a smaller restaurant and shares its space with other restaurants, and The Yard.  Nice ambiance and friendly service, but the food was OK.  I sampled a lot of different dishes and really nothing stood out.  The portions are really small here.  My girl and I ordered some orange juice, which they had was fresh squeeze and you could tell the difference, which was great.  Too bad it was served in a little glass.  Couldn't be more than 10 ounces.  I ordered the chiliquiles and my lady ordered the divorced egg dish.  Both tastes good, but wasn't really a lot of food.  Go to the Original breakfast house and the chiliquiles is double the portion and tastes better.  I'm a huge fan of breakfast places and I doubt I come back to this one, maybe for the ambiance and The Yard."}
{"text":"Our first time but not our last... Chicken Suiza Enchiladas were amazing!  Not to creamy or large a plate. The Chorizo on top was really spicy and savory and I loved it. I ordered a santan beer but it was not cold. We will be back."}
{"text":"A friend recommended that we (two food bloggers) hit up this restaurant while driving through on our way to Santa Fe, New Mexico. What a wonderful surprise and discovery -- Barrio Urbano in Phoenix. Immediately from the brightly colored decor to the warm greeting from the staff, I knew this was going to be a good eating experience. I was not disappointed. We had a sample of tacos, chili verde and pork, al pastor, carne asada, chorizo and all of the meats were well-seasoned and tender. Nothing special about the corn tortillas, but the fillings were up to par. Definitely going to hit this spot when we are back in town."}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews about places until I've been there more than once, but my recent experience was so bad I feel the need to share.   We had a reservation for a surprise birthday party on a Friday night. Seated promptly, no problem. After that it went all downhill. Our first round of drinks took well over 30 minutes to hit the table. As a server I would have comped that first round, no questions asked. I ordered a martini and received a shot of warm room temperature vodka in a martini glass. Apparently they only know how to pour beers and make margaritas. Anyway. We order our meals about 20 minutes after being sat. We did not receive our entrees until an hour and a half later. My friend who made the reservation specified that she had a food allergy, received her food incorrectly, sent it back, just to have it come out wrong. Again. Everyone was done eating by the time her food came out correctly. At this point we asked to speak to a manager. He was full of excuses, saying it was a busy Friday night, blah blah blah. Don't make excuses just say sorry and fix it! He said he would \"comp us a few drinks\". Also they were out of carne asada, which we weren't made aware of until over an hour after we ordered when some other employee came out and asked a friend to change his order.   Honestly the food was good, which is the only reason for 2 stars. I wasn't looking for anything for free, but I was charged full price for my warm martini. The service just put a huge damper on what was meant to be a fun filled night.   Bottom line, skip this place and go to Culinary Dropout."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on a Friday morning and we were the only people there.  The service was excellent and friendly. The Chilaquiles was delicious!!! I also recommend the fresh squeezed orange juice. I will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. GO. Great service, our waitress really made our experience great. She had such a warm soul and passion about the food. The food - so fresh! Margaritas didn't taste like sweet and sour mix like most of the uninspired concoctions I sampled while in town. Guacamole was to die for. Large chunks of ripe avocado, jalapeños, onion, tomato, pomegranate seeds! I also loved the Yard as the backdrop for such a cheerful and delicious meal.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"You have to go! Authentic Amazing MEXICAN Food!! The flavor and love is there. I will be back for dinner!! I ordered the molletes and my husband the chilaquiles... YUM! You will not be disappointed!! The waitress was super friendly and made us feel at home. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"This place is legit! Chilequiles like my mom makes them! Add chorizo! Great service from Ivette and a kick ass Bloody Mary. This place is decorated in such a way that makes you feel welcome and your eyes are always busy looking at the art that is placed there. All the staff there make you feel like family which is unusual for such a hipster haunt. Love it!! Everything I've ever had there has been excellent and beautifully plated."}
{"text":"Small portions? NOT! Wonderful food, awesome guacamole, good sized portions, great Happy hour starting at 7am! Perfect for night shifters. Our waitress kyong was very helpful and made great suggestions. Drinks very tasty. Will Def be back, with friends! Always looking for early places for after work."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad but the major issue was the lack of service and hospitality.  As someone who has worked in the hospitality industry for several years (as did half of my table), I am very forgiving when it comes to server errors, servers being swamped and having too much to handle at once, etc.  What bothered us was the fact that the server never acknowledged the issues or apologized for being too busy to run our drinks out or forgetting to ring in part of our order and not realizing it until we flagged him down because the rest of the food was getting cold as we waited for 10 minutes.  It was almost as if he thought that avoiding it would make us forget.  If you just admit to the problems and act like you care, I am always 100% understanding and don't get upset because I have been a server myself.  Mistakes happen and service can get delayed because you are busy, but it is all about how you handle it.    The most upsetting part was that the General Manager was standing around the dining room all night, chewing on his nails (literally), and never once offered to help his struggling staff or come to the table to see how everything was.  When I went up to the bar at the end of our meal to get change from the bartender, he was actually standing with the bartender, talking crap about a previous guest who had been complaining about the restaurant.  The bartender wouldn't even acknowledge me standing there until his manager was done telling his story and that definitely was the cherry on top for me.  Overall, it was an unpleasant experience and none of us plan to go back.  It is a shame because Barrio Cafe is such a wonderful restaurant and I was excited to see what Barrio Urbano had to offer."}
{"text":"Another great restaurant by chef Silvana of Barrio Cafe fame. The restaurant and its parking lot were a bit hard to find, but I liked the urban Mexican feel and decor of the cafe. The service was delightful and the food delicious. I had the enchiladas which were a creative combination of cheeses and spinach. The guacamole appetizer was as good as it is at Barrio Cafe."}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Review**  Since no one else had left a vegetarian review for Barrio Urbano on Yelp AND their menu does not designate vegetarian options online, I was hesitant to try BU.   I am here to say that while they do have some pretty tasty options, it is certainly not a vegetarian centric restaurant. My boyfriend and I went for Taco Tuesday ($2 tacos = best), and were limited to three options: elote, papa y queso, and black beans y queso. The elote taco was extremely tasty, and the black bean tacos were good as well, though they are a pretty basic black bean taco. The papas taco was good, but a little different. The taco was like seasoned red potato in a tortilla. Good, just different from what I am used to in Texas (San Antonio, specifically). Each taco was served on two delicious corn tortillas. I'm not sure if they make them in house, but they are certainly fresh! Other than that, we were severely limited on the menu to a few salads and a few items wherein we would have to request it without the meat (which, our waiter admitted, would defeat the purpose of many of those dishes).  My boyfriend and I also got the fried jalapenos (a good deal at $2, but nothing special), and the table side guacamole. The guacamole was tasty, but a little expensive ($10.75, I think?). I guess since I make pretty good guac, I wasn't convinced it was worth the price.  My boyfriend got the piña agua fresca (awesome!) and I had some of the house infused hibiscus tequila (super tasty!). Both were reasonably priced at $4 and $4.50, respectively.  The server was a lot of fun and extremely kind, even if a tad forgetful. Though, it also appeared that he might have been serving the entire restaurant, so it would be understandable that he might be overworked.   As others have mentioned, the Yard basically requires valet, so that's a bummer, but otherwise it might be impossible to find parking, even on a Tuesday. Overall, I would definitely return to Barrio Urbano with my meat-eating friends so that we can all enjoy a good taco, but I probably won't return there on my own.  *SIDE NOTE for VEGANS: All of our tacos came with cheese, though I'm sure that can be left off. I am not sure if butter was used in any of the tacos or if salad dressings are vegan.*"}
{"text":"I had been here about a year ago and had a delicious meal so decided to go back for my birthday. Since it was a Saturday, I had reserved a table online and was happy to see they had proactively set it aside when we arrived. But it never got better from there on out.  I ordered a bourbon drink and was told they were out of one of the ingredients so they couldn't make it, then ordered another drink and was told the same. So, I ordered a michelada, and - wait for it - they were out of the draft beer I ordered for it. I ended up hastily choosing some other drink with ginger beer that was so bitter I had a hard time sucking it down.  On to the food. First, they were out of one of the specials - so they should have just erased it from the board vs. telling everyone they were out of it. My father ordered a chipotle rubbed chicken dish and just happened to ask if it was spicy. The server said not really and in turn, my boyfriend asked the same and was told his dish was extremely spicy. The spiciest on the menu in fact. There was no indicator on the menu that it was 'extremely' spicy. He wouldn't have even known had he not asked. And he, as well, hastily chose something else. Guess what? Yep, my father's dish was pretty darn spicy.  All in all, the food was decent enough but certainly not worth the sub-par menu availability on a Saturday night. I won't go out of my way to return here."}
{"text":"Stopped in to meet a friend.  I had never been there before but loved the cool vibe.  Food was fantastic.  I was too early to try one of their 10,000 different tequilas (ok 10K may be an exaggeration) but will return.   I can see why so many of my friends who live in central Phx rave about it.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"Now don't get me wrong the food is definitely 5 stars as well as the service from the girl bartender that knew her stuff like crazy. The reason why I gave it a 3 star review and this can go with Culinary Dropout and Cleo's, they force you to use the \"complimentary\" valet. The issue I have with this is I was on vacation and in a rental convertible car. Ate dinner then came out to have our car brought back to us. Got in the car and half way back to our hotel we noticed a piece was missing from the car. We were 100% sure it was there before we went to dinner. After thinking about it and watching the guys while waiting for our car. During the time waiting I noticed 1 or 2 of the guys go out to cars with their cell phones using them as lights while not grabbing the cars to bring them back to someone. I thought this was odd but didn't think about it much. Until we got into our car and noticed a piece missing. Again this place has awesome food but sucks you have to use this \"complimentary\" service."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to trying this restaurant but I doubt that I will ever go back. I ordered the Barrio Revueltos which consists of egg whites scrambled with spinach, onion and sausage. Unfortunately the plate contained way too much onion and very little egg white. The breakfast papas were cold when my plate was delivered. Maybe breakfast foods are not the best options to try here."}
{"text":"This place had some amazing food! I feel that their cochinito pibil was amongst one of the best I've ever had! Their mole enchiladas were amazing! This was my go to for Mexican! I wasn't a big fan of the micheladas but everything else was definitely great! Their service made you feel like you mattered! The environment was great! Definitely would love to be able to come back sometime"}
{"text":"I've been to the other barrio location on 16th street and Thomas quite recently and I was blown away. I wish I could say that about this place. I ordered the chile relleno, which was highly recommended by the waiter as being delicious. When my food arrived i was quite disappointed by the lack of flavor and extremely small portion. I would think for 23$ it would come with a side. :("}
{"text":"We were there during the soft opening, for Sunday breakfast. The food was nothing short of delicious, but it's to be expected from Chef Silvana! I had the Huevos Divorciados. Each egg sits on a different sauce (red & green) and both sauces were excellent! I scraped all the sauce off the plate so as not to loose a drop. They serve Menudo 7 days a week....rare! The menu is not your typical Mexican restaurant, and a bit upscale (pricing, too), but worth the visit. You will enjoy the patio atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came in to Urbano having eaten at Barrio Cafe at the airport and on 16th St. many times. I was not disappointed at all! Now I have been here twice so this is the cumulative review of my visits.  First off the decor was understated but still has a street vibe. I'd say inside has 24-30 seats and outside on the patio has that doubled up. You have your choice of being in either area and depending on the weather, they're both terrific.   The bar has nice choices of some great unique tequilas and even though I didn't have any drinks on my visits, I will definitely be back to partake here shortly.  We had a family style meal so I had the chance to try and share many different appetizers and entrees. We had the guacamole and chips, steak tacos, fish tacos, arizona burrito, and a bowl of fruit that was done very uniquely but very awesome!  The burrito was absolutely delicious. Moist, plentiful, and value oriented. The steak tacos were on point which were close to a street taco style. Steak was perfectly done and had a ton of meat on each taco. The guacamole and chips can be eaten just as a meal its that delicious. Pomegranate seeds mixed in, big chunks of avocado which is different than what you would get in most restaurants which is over whipped and bland. This was chunky but most of all fresh. The fruit cup was delicious as well. Various fruit and abundant but coated with some type of light agave or honey but it's to die for.  Service was spectacular while the manager touched our table multiple times each trip. We felt like we were appreciated and wanted which is something not every restaurant delivers.   I'll be back. Thanks Barrio Urbano."}
{"text":"Sour margaritas and just OK carne fries. Glad we didn't stay beyond that. Stomach kinda hurt now."}
{"text":"I'm pretty much aligned with some of the reviews posted... The food was fantastic- it should be as it took 45 minutes to receive... Note to Chef: water should be provided immediately (common sense should kick in when seated in the sun), waiters should NEVER use the excuse of a new cook for a food delay, if a customer must wait 45 minutes- perhaps some complimentary ice tea would help. This restaurant seems to suffer from a CenPho phenomenon... It appears college kids are running the show... Perhaps a dedicated floater/Manager would ensure that staff/ service are on point... It was obvious Silvia was no c where to be found... In her absence,  someone needs to care about the product and service as if it was their own restaurant."}
{"text":"Ask for the taco menu and the individual taco price is good 2.50 to 3.50 per taco. The service is abit slow but very entertaining when they do serve you."}
{"text":"Went to this place with a bunch of friends. The food was fantastic! I had a barrio pollo burrito. It was huge and I was unable to finish it. There was a delicious cheeses sauce in the burrito that was Sooo amazing. The servers were very nice and took photos of our group. Right within the restaurant area there is also a very large area where there are games you can play including giant Jenga! The parking was tricky and when we came at 7 pm there were no spots left. We ended up parking across the street at Bashas parking lot. The atmosphere was pleasant and the music was excellent."}
{"text":"Another great addition to the Yard. Modern, funky takes on traditional Mexican food. Lots of heat,  lots of heart in every dish,  plated in controlled portions and accompanied by one of the best guacamole bowls I've ever had.  Make sure you get at least 1, the ingredients will delight! Wait staff were wonderful; great recommendations of tequila, efficient service in spite of a late sitting, and plenty of funky decorative touches made it a great dining experience.  Get in there."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and have been to Barrio Urbano dozens of times. We always take  friends and out of town guests there as well. Why...?? Well besides being a short walk.. Food - YUM!!! Consistantly prepared, incredibly delicious and creative! I think we've tried everything on the menu.  Drinks - EXCELLENT!! Especially when Shannon makes them. Definitely try the 'El Picado' and the 'Sonoran Daisy', but all the drinks are crafted well! The service is always a little slow, but I think it's the chefs perfecting your dishes every single time. So, get some gaucamole tableside and some cocktails and relax! Atmosphere is casual and comfortable. Best server is Lorenzo!"}
{"text":"Food  was excellent. I had the pork with nopal. Pork was cooked well and the green sauce had lots of flavor and the right amount of spice. My partner had the enchiladas suizas and they rocked. They were Topped with chorizo, really good. Service was a little slow but the waiter knew his stuff."}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant. I have enjoyed every meal and menu item that I have had here. Breakfast is outstanding, but their small plates make a great lunch or dinner. They also have an excellent selection of tequilas and have Victoria on tap - which is a home run for me. Favorites include: juevos rancheros, esquites (corn), and mula de asada."}
{"text":"Amazing! From the food to the service it was all wonderful. Candice our waitress did a great job at recommending the best dishes. From our appetizer, the elote fries to our main entrees! I had the tortas maya, a spicy chicken sandwich with bacon and avocado. The rest of the table loved their food as well, we had tacos burritos and enchiladas a little of everything. Can't say enough good things, it was an experience from beginning to end."}
{"text":"We came in for breakfast during Arizona Breakfast weekend, and it was definitely a good choice. At 7:30, we were the first people there, so it's hard to judge the service, but everyone was friendly. It's a very cool place, especially with the Yard all around it. We had the posole (pork soup) and chilaquiles (chips with eggs) and both were great, but watch out for the spice in that posole if you can't handle it. I've always loved Mexican breakfasts, and this is a great choice for it."}
{"text":"This was another great pick on our recent trip to Phoenix.  Diverse menu, really good flavors, quality service, good drinks.  That is a recipe for success, and we'll be back.  Please know this, we valet parked our car, and this location is clearly in a party environment where a communal space seems to be enjoyed by a number of different establishments.  Again, it was a great environment for fun.  Clearly the fun can go over the top, as fun often does, and so the local sheriff had a presence right near the valet parking area.  So, as we all know, when the fun goes too far, stay longer, sober up, or get a driver.  Again, if I'm in Phoenix again, I'd be thinking about this place.  Really a great time."}
{"text":"Went for a \"lunch with the ladies\" mid-week and wished I could come back with the crazy women in the evening.  The food was excellent - fresh, balanced flavors and a real authentic flair.  The setting, on that crazy big covered patio/park area was super cool.  I'm from the dirty pueblo down south - we don't have anything like that down there!  I wanna come back and pitch some ping-pongs into someone's salsa sometime!  Wait staff was friendly, fast and really knew their stuff.  Felt like we were being served by the owner.  I thought the chips were just a touch greasy, and as a \"complimentary\" appetizer, a bit weak for the 3 of us.  That wouldn't stop me from coming back for more pozole, though!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here to eat here with my family and it was delicious. Each one of us loved our meal. My favorite was the chef's dessert which consists of strawberries, banana and a rum sauce served with yummy ice cream.  We sat outside and the servers turned on the heat lamps for our group of 11. After our meal we played jenga, ping pong and corn hole. Great food and fun!"}
{"text":"So let me start out that we tried to give BU a chance to remedy our disappointment by inviting us back but the woman who listened to our complaint when we called to share our experience had nothing but excuses and no solutions :-(.  Our experience: We made reservations the evening before on OpenTable for an early brunch the next morning, Saturday. We were delighted to see our table was ready. As our party arrived we waited patiently (30 minutes) to give our order. We waited another 30 plus minutes for our meals. During this time we were randomly flagging down various employees for a refill of our drinks. If we would have known who are waiter was we would have  ordered 2 or 3 more rounds of drinks.  FINALLY My plate arrived and much to my surprise it included black beans....all 10 of them! I am not exaggerating. My husbands chili quillas was a few chips no cheese or sauce. I finally flagged down a very nice woman who brought me back a 1/2 cup of beans and introduced herself as the manager. I expressed our party of 8's disappointment and she was kind enough to bring back coupons for free guacamole and 25% off the bill. We were with family from SF who have no intentions of using their coupons when they return because they were not impressed with the food or the service!! We were at BU for 2 1/2 hours!! With no one waiter to call our own, no refills of water, and no bill!! We could have all gotten up and left but since we are all law biding citizens we waited patiently for our bill. we were soo excited to finally leave we Unfortanetely left our my daughters soup behind. Would I go back? Not now! That's why we called this past Monday to give BU a chance and to speak with someone who should have said \"I'am sorry\".... Not that the kitchen is small and we were there during Restaurant Week (wouldn't you think they would be on their A game since it was Restaurant Week?!)...."}
{"text":"The watermelon margarita was off the hook! So good! Guacamole with pomegranate was surprisingly good too. Black bean are smokey, chips are fresh made and ceviche was fresh and flavorful.  On top of that, the service was great. I'll be back with friends."}
{"text":"I was excited to see another Barrio outpost make their home at the Yard!  I came by with two friends for dinner and we sat on the \"patio\".  We started with skinny margaritas and guacamole made tableside and I had the famous enchilada suizas for my entree...just as good as I remembered them at the original Barrio on 16th Street.  Good service, good location in the Yard and seriously tasty food!"}
{"text":"It was packed when I went to The Yard and the Barrio Urbano has available tables and my experience was awesome! My server was really friendly. He made the guacamole with pomegranate in front of me. It's so fresh, a really must try! I love the food, very flavorful."}
{"text":"OVERPRICED!   I was hoping id like this place...but i didn't. Well, i didnt not like the food but i didn't love it enough to want to go back... at least not eat. The drinks are good. ;)  In my opinion, the food is over priced. We had a chile guero appetizer thing; lump of crab stuffed chiles. Spicy! As they should be, but i was expecting crab inside the chiles. Then we ordered something described as being tortillas stuffed with azada meat n cheese and avicado etc..... it sounded good! But when it arrived it wasn't what i expected. Basically, in sonora this might be called a sincronozada, or a vampiro  Basically, two tortillas, and in between the tortillas there is cheese and taco meat. It wasn't bad, but overpriced at geeze, i can't remember if it cost 15 bucks or more....sorry. those are the only the food items we tried and we weren't knocked off our feet at all. I could get a quesadilla with carne at Yaquis taco stand and be much much more happy with it.   We ordered a margarita and a chilada (beer with lime juice and asked rim) and those were good. The marg was VERY good, actually! We might be back for drinks... tal vez! Pero, lo dudo mucho."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my birthday dinner.  The ambiance was ok....with lots of lively activity over at the Yard with the games, almost too loud.  The service was less than spectacular.  The host answered the phone right when we walked up and it was very awkward.  The waiters were nice but just not as attentive as they should have been.  I will say it was the best Pozole I've ever had and I'm a Pozole connoisseur.  My entree, the Steak and egss were OK.  The OG Margaritas were great too."}
{"text":"Just had brunch here and it was fantastic.  Our server Lorenzo was great.  We had a Bloody Mary and it was very spicy.  Could have used an olive or two but even without it, we loved it.  I had the brisket burrito with egg and jalapeño. The salsa that was on the side was fresh and spicy as well.  We can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"My wife suggested the idea of coming here for breakfast for the 'Arizona Breakfast Weekend'. Their special was $7 breakfast which included mimosa, Bloody Mary or coffee. Without having made reservations our wait time was about 30-40mins but because the bar counter was open we decided to sit there and not have to wait. My wife ordered their chilaquiles with egg and I got the chorizo with egg burrito. We absolutely loved it!! The atmosphere is great, service was great and food was delicious. If you're looking for a modern/hipster Mexican restaurant come here and enjoy. We're definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I have been to this establishment twice. Let me tell you the servers and wait staff are top notch. Yvette and Lorenzo are numero uno in my book. They gave excellent recommendations on foods and drinks. I enjoyed them all. The restaurant is family friendly. The manager is so friendly. I love their customer service!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. Not only the ambiance put me in a good mood, but the service. When you come in you'll most likely be greeted by a short-haired, hi-energy lady. She's sorry in stature but a larger than life personality. The menu is varied. One star off just because my Posole (soup) was lacking flavor, but the cocktails were definitely in point. I would definitely give them another try though."}
{"text":"When we arrived to Barrio Urbano it seemed like we came at the wrong time, which was about 4pm on weekday. We had to walk to the middle of the restaurant, passed the bar, to get recognized as customers! The waiter, well.... I guess he was new. If he wasn't new, I'm not sure what to say. We had two kids and he sat us down and I asked if they had a kid's menu. He had apparently not realized to small children would need a kid's menu? There were other things that didn't jive with him as well. But besides the subpar service, the food was just okay. The 'spicy fries' are just stock french fries with paprika on them. The potatoes that came with the kid's meals were the same french fries. My burrito, which was one of their signature items is forgetful. We were hoping for another great Mexican restaurant but instead, we won't be back to this one."}
{"text":"Barrio Café is one of my favorite restaurants, so I wanted to like this so much more than I did. The space is cute - we sat on the patio. Enjoyed a spicy margarita that was discounted ($5) for Cinco de Mayo. Our server was not great. She was nice but did not seem very familiar with the menu items. We had a group of six and there was a long delay in bringing the entrée that one of my friends ordered. Basically, his food arrived after everyone else's. When we finally asked, she said they ran out of an ingredient and had to make more to finish the dish. I think she should have explained before we had to inquire, or offered to bring him an appetizer or something while he waited or discounted the bill. I had the tacos al pastor. There are about 5-6 different tacos on the menu but they come in orders of three. There is no option to mix-and-match, which is standard at places like Joyride Taco or Taco Guild. The tacos were fine but not amazing (especially compared to the conchita pibil tacos that I love at Barrio Café). They come with a side of spicy coleslaw with big slices of jalapeno in it. My boyfriend ordered a carne torta that did not look great. It came with fries, which I tried - nothing special. Barrio Urbano is ok, not great, not terrible. But definitely no comparison to Barrio Café and does not stand out among the countless other taco shops in town. I might give it a try for breakfast one day, but will not be rushing back for dinner."}
{"text":"I don't know what these less than stellar reviews are talking about this place does Mexican cuisine like no other. Brunch, tacos, \"elevated\" Mexican, it has it all. Service is always friendly and wonderful. Can't recommend this place highly enough."}
{"text":"Ethan was very attentive. Food was great atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"Don't bother going and wasting your money.  We went there for Sunday lunch today and waited an hour for our food.  The place was not even half full.  Unacceptable! I ordered the chicken torta (sandwich) which was blah! and not worth $13. My friend ordered the Fish Tacos, that were very disappointing, she said the tacos at Taco Bell were better! and her husband ordered the Fried Eggs, Beans and Potatoes, very basic.  The only decent item we had were the Margaritas, and Nick our server was very nice attentive.  It appeared that the Kitchen was completely disorganized and not experienced.   Very disappointing to say the least.  A big thumbs down!  Oh an the parking there is terrible and the valet SUCKS!"}
{"text":"Fabuloso!!!!!! Best ever.... We took our friends there who had never been there before and they too loved it. For the creativity and the innovative food you get, this place is so so reasonable! It is our go to place..."}
{"text":"Had expected good food from here. I've eaten at barrio cafe many times.  Food wasn't bad, my wife liked the egg dish she got.  I ordered the al pastor quesadilla.  The pork had good flavor but there was so much gristle I ended up pulling all the meat out and eating it as a cheese quesadilla.  Salsa was really good.  Server was great (Carlos). Although it took a really long time to get our food.  I'll come back to give it another try but if I wasn't a fan of barrio cafe then I probably wouldn't."}
{"text":"Food was average at best. Guac was fresh and made at table, but was extremely bland. Carne Asada burrito was boring as well. Not memorable food and will not be back ever again. Failed to mention soda was flat as well. We tried!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure, I came to The Yard with intentions of eating at the Culinary Dropout... But it was a 90 min wait and we had a full party. Barrio could seat us right away (not typically a good sign, but we decided to take a chance).   Well, we shouldn't have been excited to get sat right away, because it was still an hour until we actually got our food. And their menu is severely limited: only half a dozen or so entrees, and cocktail menu is just several different spins on the Margarita. Not terribly complex or difficult to pump out. Plus the place was only half full of guests. We should've got our food much quicker. Very disappointing. Especially since it is Mexican. Mexican food has about four basic ingredients - it should never take this long to prepare.  And then we finally received the food; it didn't improve. Entrees sizes are dismal. I'm talking ridiculously small, for outrageous price ($23 for sliver of skirt steak, GTFO). I'm not one to expect Claim Jumper style portions. But an entree should not be mistaken for an appetizer. The food itself was ok. So they get an extra star for that. But that is where my generosity ends.  So much potential wasted.  To top it all off. You know those cheap Madonna candles that they sell at the dollar store? Yeah, those are littered all around the tables. In the middle of serving, one of our waiters knocked a candle over and spilled hot wax all over our toddler and our food. Yay.  F- this place. Yeah I said it.   Most of the servers were trying to please (except for candle fail incident)... But you can only do so much when the menu,  kitchen and planning blow.  They've only been open few weeks... so maybe they'll improve. Good luck."}
{"text":"1st visit good happy hour 2nd visit BEST taco tuesday!! Chill and fun environment and the menu had a wide selection of authentic food! It's a must. Not much of a tequila fan but the GM Ramon knows his products. Everything from the fresh guac MADE AT YOUR TABLE and dessert is to die for."}
{"text":"So sad for the chef, loved the food but service was terrible. Server Jose never once smiled and ignored our requests numerous time. Manager accused us of skipping on one tab out of 16 even though we weren't even ready to leave. Literally had security tell us to pay the tab while we were still trying drink and eat. I'm sorry chef Sal can't recommend this place cuz of this terrible experience on my friends birthday"}
{"text":"As a long time fan and customer of Barrio Cafe, I ate there tonight with family and friends. Food was so-so. Hard avocados in the guac ($11). No salsa with the chips (chef Silvana doesn't think it's really traditionally Mexican). Service very slow. No air conditioning, just misters. Horrible parking. The Yard is an outdoor playground for young adults. If you are looking for ping-pong, bean bag toss, beers and other twenty-somethings, check it out. A location for dining, it is not."}
{"text":"Honestly worst service I've experienced. Ivette was the worst server I've ever had. The place was completely empty yet it took me 20 minutes to get a drink and 20 minutes after I ordered my food she forgot to put it in. I was charged for a side of avocado I wanted for my food and got brought and charged for that without my food even coming. Honestly closed out and just left because I was over it. Will never come back. Horrible."}
{"text":"First off all, they had amazing margaritas (El Picado's) and then we had an appetizer which was absolutely amazing (Esquites, make sure you add the fries). Our server, Lorenzo, was very attentive and informative. He had recommended the Mole Enchiladas, which most places cannot perfect, and they were unbelievably good, maybe the best we my wife and I have had in Phoenix. Overall, really enjoyed the food, cocktails, and definitely the service!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for some super trendy atmosphere with average to below average food, this is the place for you. The chips and guacamole were horrible. The fish tacos were dry."}
{"text":"We found this spot in the magazine of our hotel room and decided to give it a try. We ended up being very happy with our choice. We got the carne asada burrito and the barrio pollo burrito and both were excellent!  There verde sauce is amazing. Very flavorful!  To top it off we ended with a very delicious churro dessert. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside topped with ice cream. Yummy!!!!  The service was great and the food came out fast, piping hot, and fresh. So glad we found this place."}
{"text":"3 stars for the chips and salsa, oh and for the bites of the AZ burrito that my friend shared with me. I ordered the Mayan Torta as recommend by our waitress and I was so disappointed totally underwhelmed. The only thing overwhelming was the spices/marinade used on the chicken it was so over powering I couldn't taste anything else, not even the bacon! We also ordered the fresh guacamole which was really good, but not $10 good. I don't think I'll be trying this place again, too expensive and food just not worth the price it's like buying things name brand purely for the label even though the generic tastes just a good."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience eating here and fantastic service.  (Service was so good that we tipped extra on top of the mandatory tip included for our large party.)  You'd think for a hipster place that the birthday boy (turning 80) and his cohorts (many 70 or older) would've possibly felt uncomfortable.  However, this was a welcoming and accommodating restaurant, the food was outstanding and the servers incredibly nice.  We had a large party (15) for a birthday dinner and our generus host ordered multiple appetizers.  These were over the top YUMMY.  The cheese dip was phenomenal with grilled vegetables stacked at the bottom of the bowl.  The guacamole was heavenly topped with pomegranate seeds.  But, as inevitably happens, many of us got full on the app's so a good third of our group didn't actually order a meal.  Do you think our server even bat an eye when she found out she wasn't going to have 15 full dinners on the tab as the basis for her tip?  Nope.  No way.  She was actually super sweet when many in our party didn't order entrees, asking us if we wanted more chips and salsa.  Now that's classy.  I could've eaten a whole bowl of the queso/cheese dip myself and after seeing the menu, we all agree that we must come back again.  There's LOTS of options for vegetarians and we loved the atmosphere.  Being part of The Yard complex, you'd think parking would be a nightmare, but even with 3 tour buses dropping off tourists for a private party, the parking was a breeze.  This is a total recommend on all fronts:  atmosphere, quality of food, service... and they have the parking down to a science."}
{"text":"I love this place. I ate yesterday for the first time. It was amazing. Literally everything I could've expected. Warm friendly service, an amazing cook and staff behind the kitchen. I got the chilaquiles and so did my girlfriend. It was excellent. But when I went back today the same cheerful attitude was gone. I quickly realized something was wrong and you may ask why I'm giving five stars if something went wrong. Well for starters I walk in and there was instant confusion. Some sort of quarrel was happening between the kitchen and the only waitress on staff. I don't know the waitresses name nor should it be put on blast, but long story short the manager who was called in to fix this problem going on not only handled the entire situation by himself but he also serviced the entire restaurant that was now filling up with people. With barely no help at all, I watched this kid coordinate the entire place with ease. We got our food in a timely manner and he made our drinks quick and efficiently and handled it all with stride. Only at a place of caliber like this will you see professionals acting like professionals. I dig it. For a Saturday morning that's impressive."}
{"text":"Great food, good drinks, awesome atmosphere. Would come here more often if I lived closer. Me and my friends all orders different types of quesadillas and they were all great. Definitely recommend this place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"My burrito was good, my Rita so so . The staff was great. Place was very clean and colorful. I want to go back to try the breakfast food served till 3pm."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time at Barrio Urbano. The Hispanic flared location has an open kitchen area with great artwork accents. I started with the guacamole and chips and finished with the Menudo. All was fresh and very tasty. I am a bit biased because I am a huge fan of urban foods and looks. If in the area and want some Mexican food with a twist this is a must stop. Not a lot of space tho so make sure you have some time if the place is busy."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Will Smith - Miami)  Here I am in the place where I come to eat the drinks and the street tacos Everyday in The Yard in all, everybody party all day No work all play, okay So we sip a little something, lay to rest the spill Me and Jenny at the bar runnin up a high bill Nothin less than ill, when we dress to kill  Everytime the waiter pass, they be like (Hi Bo) Can y'all feel me, all drinks and cocktails Real spicy sauces Every different toppings, Chicken, Onions, Asada, Cilantro Pork, Steak, Cubano or Salsa  I only came to Bo Bites and playing But everytime I come I always wind up eating This the type of place I could spend a few days in Urbano the place that keeps the kitchen blazing  Party in The Yard where the heat is on All night, on the patio till the break of dawn Welcome to Urbanos Buenvenidos at Urbanos Bouncing in The Yard where the heat is on All night, on the patio till the break of dawn I'm going to Barrio Urbano Welcome to Urbanos   I think any place with the name Barrio is going to work especially here in the valley!  Barrio Urbano is located inside The Yard next to Cleo's.  I really enjoy the lively atmosphere these three places provide.  Great food and live entertainment yeah!  The only thing weird about it is that you can't bring food and drinks in and out of each restaurant as if you were in Vegas!    Needless to say, I wasn't too bummed.....maybe just a little.  I always seem to sit at the bar when I attend Barrio Urbano; ahem!  Drink menu please!  The bartender is very knowledgeable about Tequila and let's just say my favorite drink here is the El Picado; a spicy limey cocktail.  Food here is amazing with James Beard nominated Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza in the kitchen or at least creating some banging meals!  I went for the street tacos this time around starting with the Carne Asada, Pulled Pork, Fish Tacos, and the Chicken Avocado.  Overall, I love them!  The carne asada and pulled pork was tender and had limey cilantro bite.  The fish tacos was perfectly cooked and the cabbage provide a crunchy welcoming texture.  Finally, the chicken avocado was good, but definitely probably my least favorite of the four.    In the end, Barrio Urbano brings great Mexican food was a modern twist.  I love the atmosphere and the list of Tequila they have and I can't handle too much of it. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"visiting from out of town. we wanted to try culinary drop out, in the same little complex but the wait was over an hour. we were seated right away. Margarita was not the best but decent. kids had Mexican sodas which they love. chips and salsa with beans were super good. I had the Mula asada which was so damn good! best Mexican good I've had in a restaurant in the United states. just so delicious and fresh. we also had the suadero burrito which was really flavorful but quite spicy, actually too spicy for my main sqeeze. service was great, she was so good with my kids. I'm going back next time we r in town visiting my step daughter. oh and it's not pricey at all for the quality. I HATE it when people comment about prices being too high for Mexican food. the f*** does that even mean!?!? Don't!"}
{"text":"I'd heard nothing but good things about Barrio on 16th so I figured this place would be a safe bet.  I've eaten here three times and that'll probably be it for me.  Ambiance: The indoor portion of the restaurant is nice and decorated well with some beautiful paintings.  The outdoor area is basically shared with yard, which is cool.  Service: In the three trips I've made here I don't think I've seen the hostess smile once.  Wait time for someone to take an order and wait time for food were both too long on both occasions (I met friends there mid-meal on my second trip).  This last visit we (group of 5) we're waiting for our food for about 35 minutes and the restaurant was barely half full.  Water glasses sat empty for a while as well.  Food: I ordered the huevos rancheros on my first visit and I was underwhelmed.  Maybe I was expecting too much, but the portion size left me far from full.  The dish itself wasn't particularly flavorful in my opinion.  Maybe it's just my underdeveloped palate, but I was craving some 'bertos afterward to satiate my Mexican food craving.    On my second visit I got the chorizo and egg burrito a shot.  The chorizo was tasty but it was literally just egg and chorizo.  Some cheese, guac or sour cream would have gone a long way.  Again, this is purely subjective but it wasn't all that enjoyable for me.  On this last visit I got the torrejas (French toast, basically) and it was pretty good.  Serving size was more than adequate and the jalapeno bacon that came with it was great.  I did, however, have to ask for syrup twice.    I can say that neither myself or anyone I've eaten with has ever been disappointed with their drinks. The muelas (SP?) are their version of a Moscow mule made with tequila and they're great.  I really wanted this place to be good but I just didn't enjoy my meals there enough to want to go back."}
{"text":"Before getting to the food, let me say this restaurant is in a very interesting location.  It's part of a large building called The Yard, and Barrio Urbano is one of three restaurants who share the space and a game area that has ping-pong and foosball.  The restaurant has a very cool-looking entrance, but with one of the heaviest doors I've ever tried to open.    The restaurant could use more employees.  Our server was very peppy and fun, but we spent  much of our time fascinated by how fast she moved from table to table.  Fast as she was, she had way too much to handle and we had a hard time getting her attention.  It took too long for our meals to arrive and, since this isn't a free-bowl-of-chips type of Mexican restaurant, we were super hungry.  We would have ordered an appetizer (like those chili verde fries) to hold us over but, based on the length of time for the meals to arrive, we worried that the appetizer would come even later.  The food was delicious and the menu intriguing.  This isn't your enchilada and taco combo place.  I ordered a torta al pastor sandwich, consisting of well-seasoned carne asada, avocado, and grilled pineapple on an absolutely delicious bun.  However, it arrived without the pineapple, the ingredient that originally sold me on the dish.  Once we got the server's attention, she brought some in a dish.    Hubby had equally delicious chilaquiles.  The green sauce was wonderful, and the entree came with potatoes and black beans.  Both dishes were a good size and hubby wound up taking half home.  Not me.  Not after that long wait for food.   I wish there were a 3.5 rating as this place is worth going back to, but the long wait seems to be consistent with  some other reviews for this establishment.  A plus for me, Barrio Urbano offers all-day breakfast dishes and fresh-baked pastries."}
{"text":"As die-hard fans of the classic, arguably brilliant, Barrio Cafe on 16th St., we decided to try Barrio Urbano tonight. The culinary experience left me wondering if Chef Silvana has even set foot in this place, let alone eaten there. While I truly cannot say enough good things about the original locale, I cannot say enough bad about this unfortunate spinoff.   The ambiance at the Yard is great, but this is about the only thing Urbano has going in its favor. Picture Taco Bell's food quality with deceptively trendier branding, a menu at an 8th-grade reading level, a costlier price point by orders of magnitude, and voila, you have Barrio freaking Urbano. Yes, that's right--I left wishing we'd had our family dinner at the sister airport location, which is indisputably gourmet by comparison.  Save yourself the trip, wait the hour for 16th St., or opt for a short stack at Denny's in the smoking section, because any of these things would serve you better than Barrio Urbano."}
{"text":"Stopped by Friday night because I was craving their burritos and wanted my wife to try to it for the first time. Once again they did not disappoint.  The service was good and we were seated right away. I had the carne asada burrito and it was amazing. My wife had the Arizona burro and loved it. They don't come with sides, but you don't need it. We both had leftovers. The table side guac was good as well. I've had the brisket burrito in the past and crave it often!"}
{"text":"I have ordered a few things from here and have yet to be disappointed. The guac is mashed table side and it is so fresh that it was hard to hold my self back. I was polite and dunked the occasional chip in there allowing others at the table to get a taste. Had I been alone I would have used my spoon to shovel that green goodness into my mouth and not even thought twice about it!   I then had the Menudo and it was the perfect amount of spice! Tripe can sometimes become chewy or bland but this soup had it down to a science. I have never had tripe that good before and will be back just for this soup!  I can't wait to go back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was great! They have a good selection of tacos for both vegetarians and meat-eaters, and the michelada is actually tasty. I've been to some hipster Mexican restaurants that mess that drink up royally, and this is not one of them.   Price wise, I would say this place is damn fair for the quality of the food. You might consider it spendy relative to some places, but the guac is also made tableside and the food is really really good, so it gets to be a little spendy.  The one thing that's kind of a bummer is that, being nestled into a side spot at The Yard, it's got a small floorplan relative to the demand for their tacos, especially on Tuesday. But if your least favorite thing about a place is that so many people like it you have to wait a bit for a seat, you're doing alright.  tl;dr Come for the Miches, stay for the tacos."}
{"text":"During the summer, their happy hour starts at 7am! Wow! We went to celebrate Father's Day and had a great meal. Between everyone in our party, I think we tried all the tacos. Not a bad one in the bunch! I loved the Barrio Chorizo one! The Chilaquiles were delicious, the bollito French toast was fantastic! We finished up with the churro desert which is what they serve at their sister restaurant Barrio Cafe. So good! The server was awesome and knowledgeable as well!"}
{"text":"Just had the Gringa quesadilla, of course it was great!  Solid Mexican beverages... like Arnold said,  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Picked Barrio Urbano at the yard for Mothers Day dinner, they had some things they were out of like the Mexican water drinks and the churro deserts, I ordered a red sangria to drink and it was great but when I ordered another they were out of it? So I opted for the white sangria which was very good, just surprised they'd run out especially on a Holiday,  that was disappointing but everyone loved their dish, although the skirt steak on my torta was a bit chewy and grisely. Took quite some time after being sat down to have anyone acknowledge our presence, I told one of the girls ,\"I think they forgot about us?\" It had been at least 15 minutes. Took another ten minutes for someone to come and take drink orders and a long time to get the orders, we ordered a sangria and two teas mind you, and again to take our order, at this point I was starting to question what time we would be leaving. Got our guacamole made and the few chips they gave us to eat the 1 avocado guac and waited at least another 30 minutes for the meal.We had desert, the tres leeches ice cream desert was good. Safe to say I will be back, to Barrio Cafe that is. Waiters were at least nice, but they seem unorganized or confused or maybe lack experience? Too young maybe?? I don't think it's a place that kids would enjoy and the candles are an accident waiting to happen. My daughter knocked one over and wax went flying."}
{"text":"Over priced average Mexican food slow service. I'll just stick to going to santisima in Gtown"}
{"text":"YET ANOTHER INCREDIBLE RESTAURANT BY CHEF SILVANA!  Just as good as the Barrio cafe!  People who don't think this is incredible Mexican Food should seek a therapist!  Seriously!"}
{"text":"Service was great! Food was definitely memorable. I had the carne azada tacos, the meat was well seasoned and was grilled unlike other places where they throw it on the flat top stove and call it grilled.  My daughters had the huevos divorciados, really good and spicy. The salsas were spicy but flavorful. They also had the posole, we have very high standards for posole, this one was really good!! Their chips and salsa were also really good and flavorful salsa. The place itself was clean and had a foosball table and other games for an evening get together with friends. Our visit was definitely memorable and we will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you about my hubby's birthday experience on April 16, 2016. AMAZING! We arrived early and put our name down for 10 people and the host accommodated us in a timely manner. We waited at the bar (bar tender was super nice) and when we were seated our server Nikales (Nik) was absolutely attentive to our table's needs. He even became a photographer for a brief moment. He recommended a tequila for my hubby to try and described the specials for our table. Nik was also knowledgeable with the beautiful art that was part of our dining experience. Please go visit Barrio Urbano and make sure to ask for Nik."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat! My server Ethan was very attentive and great! Great service! LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"This spot has the best happy hour margaritas in the Valley! They use fresh squeezed juices, house made syrups and their well tequila is quality choice! It's the worst to visit a spot that serves up store bought pre-made sugary mixes, so if you want fresh come here! The food is also on point, fresh and no short cut pre-made bullshit."}
{"text":"When Peg and I heard about The Yard about to be re-landscaped by Chef Silvana, we were all in. Her take on food, for those who love authentic Mexican cuisine (as opposed to the classic American take of use 3-4 ingredients and just shuffle them around) has always been a refreshing change. Peg and I have been twice...first week of opening and then last week. The energy is infectious and the service very very attentive. Her food is wonderfully flavorsome and fresh tasting. Chef is extremely involved in receiving feedback from customers which always bodes well. We look forward to spending more time....and breakfast there for us  is in the near future!  Dr. B"}
{"text":"Silvana is an excellent chef.Her food was superb and absolutey delicious.  José did a great job of explaining and serving the food and drinks. We will be back."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant I've been to in Phoenix hands down. Don't believe the hype, it fades quickly and then crashes and burns. Ok here we go:  1. Made 8:15 reservation, didn't get sat at our table until 8:45.  2. Our server stood at one end of the table in this extremely loud restaurant space, only took drink orders from half of the table, as the rest of the table didn't hear her. We had to go find her to get the rest of our orders, as she didn't think to ask. 3. Ordered the street corn fries and queso. Fries were ok, hard to mess up fries. The queso literally took a hour to come out and was the consistency of rubber. Terrible dish and not worth the wait.  4. They burned or messed up 3 of our entrees, took an additional hour to get those fixed. I got the stuffed pepper and it was terrible and had that rubber cheese plastered on top of it.  5. Manager came and apologized and said he would comp some dinners for the inconvenience. We got check nothing comped and we were charged for a drink we didn't order. At this point we were 3 hours into our dinning experience so just paid and ran for the hills.   There are too many great restaurants in this city to waste your time which you can't get back at this epic fail. If you wanna try it trust me and just go spend your money at the one in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I came here for two reasons.  1.) A co-worker said it was her fave Taco Tuesday deal 2.) Chef Silvana's Barrio Cafe has been chosen as No. 1 Mexican restaurant in the country by Tabelog  Barrio Urbano is not the restaurant declared No. 1, but Chef Silvana is the genius behind it all so I figured I was still in for a great treat.     My order: Carne Asada taco, Cochinita Pibil taco, and two Pork Green Chile tacos. I thought the Pork Green Chile tacos were the best of the three I tried. The margarita was amazing. I'm not too picky about my margaritas, but this one is definitely the best I've had. They had 3 options for desert, we got the churro and ice cream, which was also very tasty.   As for our service, our waiter was Eric. He was really friendly. No excessive check-in and not impossible to reach (if we had needed anything).   Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because it was my first visit. I would like to go back and try other food items."}
{"text":"Kelis was wrong. Her milkshake doesn't bring all the boys to The Yard, it's Chef Silvana's tacos. Fantastic concept, location, and food. Chef Silvana is legendary. I really like how they make the guacamole at your table. Barrio Urbano brings cultura to The Yard and it sure tastes good. They also have the biggest $2 Taco Tuesday selection around!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant thanks to a review in TV Azteca Tucson in the program Devagaciones. The food was so tasteful and loaded with cheese to die for. The restaurant atmosphere it's great, and the patio next to the playground it's great."}
{"text":"A mixed bag. The appetizers generally were superior to the entrees. The guacamole and the con queso were particularly tasty. The signature pork dish, cooked in a banana leaf, was overly salted. The Arizona burrito (which was massive) was overwhelmed with spice. The enchiladas, on the other hand, were very good. Monday's can be tricky at restaurants, and so maybe it was just an off night."}
{"text":"I just had dinner at Barrio Urbanio and had a great dinner. The food was fantastic and the server Lorrenzo was helpful and attentive. Kiddos for a job well done! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great food! Saw them on the news and had to check them out. The food was amazing! I love the corn appetizer and the chicken burrito. It melts in the mouth. My dad is extremely picky and high class and he loved this place so I will be coming again. They just opened 2 weeks ago so I think some of the other reviews are a bit harsh. Every just opening place has to work out the kinks in the beginning. I say give them a chance or wait a month until they've got their flow and rhythm. I'll be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"In the same genre as the other Chef Silvana locales, Barrio Urbrana features some eclectic spins on traditional Mexican cuisine. We had a late lunch on a Friday afternoon. BU was not quite as busy as the other \"Yard\" eateries, so we got right in. As frequenters of the original Barrio Café, we opted for the guacamole. While not prepared table side, the avocados were quite fresh and tasty. And in chunks. No attempt to mash them at all. Nuevo Guac? At $10+, I think I'd like something with a little more effort.  I had the green chile chicken burrito. It was very good, and plenty enough to take some home. My wife had the fish tacos which were pretty pedestrian, especially for what we've come to expect from Chef S's kitchens. The plate was heaped with some kind of pickled slaw, which was okay, but seemed like overcompensation for a so-so fish taco.  The drinks, as always, were terrific, as was the service."}
{"text":"To be honest, this review is because I went direct with management as to the terrible experience I've had twice at this restaurant previously.  In the recent past, this place was a disaster.  The wait staff was incompetent and the cooks even worse.  However, after my rant to management I decided to take Gary up on his offer for redemption.  Four of us went and this time it was all done right. Hostess was nice and efficient, server was senior guy and very attentive, food came out on time for ALL and was good.  Chicken was a little dry but good.  3 folks got $2 tacos and wife got torta.  Nice flavor to all.  Ordered guac and beens - both very good.  House marg is good and ordered a shot of Casamigos Rep - damn smooth. Anyway, overall it was 180 degrees better than last time and I hope can continue to get better.  I see other reviews which blow them up but I feel Gary is really trying and is new.  I'll be going back and hoping he can get things into shape."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is the first thing you feel when you walk in, however I feel the location is just not ideal for its concept.. The food / drinks are phenomenal God bless  however the drinks arrrre a bit pricey.. Unless it's happy hour, great happy hour deals. Great spot to sit and relax by yourself as well as somewhere you would want to take your family or a date perhaps. The service has gotten so much better since they've employed new management (the manager took his time to ensure I was satisfied with my experience :)"}
{"text":"Mexican food is my favorite. Let's start there.  This place is nestled on 'the Yard' which is a bustling group of restaurants which all are under the same roof. We found this place on a list and decided to try it out.  Overall, the food was pretty good. A little pricey for what you get, but somewhere good to eat if looking for a sit-down restaurant for Mexican in the area."}
{"text":"My old roommate from Philly was in town, so I decided to take him to the Yard. We decided to eat at Barrio Urbano because their Sangria looked good. Spent a little over $70 on food and drinks for two people, but sadly our service and food were pretty basic.  They do not offer pitchers of Sangria here, so I had to mark one less star for that. Secondly, it took a while to get a second round of drinks. Our original server disappeared, so we weren't impressed. We started out with the Chile Con Queso with Chips, but my friend didn't like Poblano Peppers, so he had it taken out. Sadly, I didn't get the full flavor of the Chile Con Queso plus the cheese got hard pretty quick. It got all clumpy and inedible. I think maybe they should have served it fondue-style.  Then for entree, my friend ordered the Carne Asada, and I got the Vegetarian Frijol y queso burrito. According to the menu, it's filled with Old School black bean and lots of cheese with a side of pico and salsa tamada. If you look at my picture, it didn't come with a side of pico and salsa. Just a basic, lonely and sad looking burrito. I was looking forward to it being full of flavorful cheeses, but unfortunately, it was more beans with a small amount of  clumpy cold cheese inside. I had to scoop out some of the Chile Con Queso just to give it some flavor. Since I didn't get the pico and salsa, and our server dissapeared, I just filled it with some hot sauce. By then, we started getting thirsty, and my mouth was starting to burn from the hot sauce.  Our drinks were taking a while, so I  stood up, and asked another server for some water.  I used to be a server in College, so I understand good service. If you want to earn good tips, you better deliver! If you see that customers have empty glasses, you better refill or ask if they want anything else. We couldn't find our server, so we had to ask a different one for something to drink.  Maybe the server was having one of those days! Not impressed at all. I still tipped the server $10 however even though the service sucked, and the food was basic.  The drinks were good though, but I'm not sure if I'll bring people here again. My friend mentioned that they should serve pitchers of Sangrias just in case the wait staff dissappears."}
{"text":"Had the chicken mole' enchiladas and almost started to cry. It was such a perfect interpretation of a classic Mexican dish. The favors were in perfect balance. The chocolate to chili and spice ratio was spot on. Usually it's hard to find the right balance but they did it!!!!"}
{"text":"Was reading user Shon P's review, and was taking it seriously, but stopped right in my tracks when I read \"Mexican food has about four basic ingredients\" and then it was just laughable. Clearly, this person knows nothing about authentic Mexican food,  considering it's one of the top and most intricate cuisines in the world.  Be careful who's reviews you take seriously.  Someone with such a high level of ignorance has no clue what they are talking about when it comes to Mexican food."}
{"text":"Love love love!!!! Amazing food and atmosphere!!! Gracias chef Silvana! Tequila and tacos...it doesn't get any better than this!!"}
{"text":"Part of the very cool Yard complex we visited on a Saturday at noon. Had brunch and it was OK. The bar has an amazing tequila selection. I will definitely go back to try that. The breakfast items were just oK. Not great, not bad. Service was good and very friendly.  Ping pong in the Yard was great!!"}
{"text":"If you are going to participate in AZ Breakfast weekend,  staff accordingly.   We did not have reservations and when greeted told we should have made them and they will take walkins for a 30-40 minute wait.   Yet we look around and had open tables inside and outside and also lots of open  counter space and told those are reserved too.   When asked if we could get drinks we were told she doesn't have e enough staff.   We wait a bit to see if the wait will really take that long,  met a couple who had already waited 30min  and we're told it would be another 20-30minutes that they are calling more staff in.   They asked about the empty tables they were told that those are reserved for people with reservations.   We left.   This was a FAIL."}
{"text":"By far the best torta I've ever devoured. The GM Ramon came up with some amazing recommendations.  The staff was friendly and on top of things.  If you keep going to Old Town for Mexican food you might as well stick to Taco Bell.  This place is legit!"}
{"text":"Barrio Urbano is tiny spot/smaller version of Barrio Café located in the large Culinary/Yard complex.   We came in for happy hour the other day and sat at the bar to enjoy a few snacks.  I tried the hibiscus margarita and it was delicious, not too sour with the perfect topping of hibiscus to balance it out. We also split a green chili dip that had slow roasted melt in your mouth pork and a couple of the quesadillas. Everything really good and our bartender was friendly. We will definitely be back to try the 25+ tacos they serve!   Did I mention the ridiculous happy hour? It goes from 7am-6pm ($5 apps, margs and  1/2 off tequila, tacos, apps).."}
{"text":"One of my now favorite places to go. The food was sooooo good. They have an awesome breakfast,lunch and dinner menu. Loved their Jamaica Mimosas. They took great care of us with their outstanding customer service. I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Excellent food, beer and Tequila! Best guacamole ever! One of my favorite places to eat good and relax!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for dinner last night and, although it was good, it didn't live up to my expectations.  It was a Wednesday, so they had a deal where you could pick a bottle of wine, a pitcher of beer, or 2 margaritas and then an appetizer.  We took advantage of that and had a good bottle of white wine and the corn appetizer.  I love Mexican street corn and always order it.  Theirs was ok, but it was kind of watery, and the cheese was a bit rubbery.  I've definitely had better at several places around town.  For my entree I had the Enchiladas Urbanas.  They were rich and had some good flavors, but I think the dish may have sat for a little too long in the kitchen because there was something off with the texture.  I did enjoy it, though.  My friend ordered the pollo dish, which she wasn't wild about.  It wasn't bad, but it was nothing special.  Service was pretty good.  We were outside and it started raining, and they were quick to help us with an umbrella.  Our server seemed new and kind of nervous, but she was sweet and attentive."}
{"text":"There are too many awesome restaurants in the valley (especially those that serve southwest/mexican) for a place to have 8 plates sitting under a heater with slow service. We didn't get the coffee we ordered for Sunday brunch until our food came. The food was decent. I ordered an egg white scramble with chorizo and spinach. It was delicious. My boyfriend ordered something different, it looked different, but tasted the same. Which was delicious. The potatoes were cold, despite sitting under a heater while they remembered to place our coffee order. They comped us on the coffee without us complaining,  so they get a bonus star for fixing the mistake. I might give them another try, but like I said so many other restaurants I would choose first."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in uptown! If you're not here, then you're missing out! Their guacamole is the best with pomegranates and their chips are so crispy! The salsa, to die for and the food...well, you already know it's delicious! I know there's tons of Mexican food in Phoenix, but this is one you have to try!"}
{"text":"We got two different types of enchiladas, both were very tasty but seemed too heavily sauced. Good atmosphere. Nice to be connected to The Yard. Our server was great at explaining the different menu options."}
{"text":"Food was great! Table side guacamole was delicious. Had the Relleno the flavored were great just a little on the spicy side but great dish. Also had the fish tacos and the fish was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"My review may be biased because I live in the taco-limited state of Vermont, but I fell in love with this place. The outdoor patio, with the game tables, the $2 tacos on Tuesdays, and the chili were all wonderful. The margaritas were strong, and tasty. I will definitely be back on my next trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Their food is awesome.  However service is horrible.  I've been twice now and just walked out after waiting an hour for a table.  We were finally seated and then waited over 10 minutes and no one came to our table for a drink order.  Tons of open seats on a Saturday morning for breakfast and very understaffed.  If they could hire a better staff this place would get 5 stars as the food is really good!"}
{"text":"We decided to go to Barrio Urbano with a few friends from out of town looking for a cool place to eat with good food.  We have only been here for drinks in the past, and The Yard is great, so we decided to give it a chance.  We had 7:00 pm reservations and we were seated right away.  We sat and caught up with our friends for over 30 minutes before our server realized we were there (she only noticed because the person that seated us came over to ask if we were helped).  We ordered our drinks and they took roughly 15 minutes to arrive at our table.  The drinks are quite good (I enjoyed the Old Fashioned).  We ordered the Queso dip (awesome) and the Guacamole (really good/different) which took roughly 15 to 20 minutes to arrive at our table.  Almost 30 minutes later our dinners came (2 quesadillas and 2 taco entrees)...well, only the 2 quesadillas were delivered to our table.  The 2 taco dinners did not arrive for almost 30 minutes AFTER the first 2 meals.  When the meals were dropped off the servers ran away without any explanation of why we had to wait so long.  We enjoyed our time with our friends, but our overall experience at this restaurant was one of the worst we have experienced...and for a total bill of over $225, I would expect more.  I, for one, will never come back to Barrio Urbano...I will definitely be back to The Yard."}
{"text":"Barrio Urbano has fantastic food! Hands down, the best. I always get a different dish every time I go and I have yet to be disappointed. If you go, definitely request Doug as your server. He is very friendly, helpful and got us our food very quickly. I have been very pleased with my experience at this restaurant so far and would recommend it to anyone that is looking for an excellent, authentic Mexican food cuisine. The ambience of the Yard is awesome and provides for a fun and exciting atmosphere. After dinner at Barrio make your way into the Yard for a night of games. Definitely the place to be on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"The wait staff was great.  My 'torta asada\" came out wrong first time, no biggie. Not happy to be the only one not eating, then the only person eating when everyone is done but oh well. The cook must have took offense to my sending the order back; the bun was both soggy and burned, the steak cooked to a slimy jerky texture that couldn't be cut with my knife more less chewed.  Working in the service industry I know the front of house workers rely on the back on house cooks, I wish the person preparing my food at least took into consideration their fellow employee."}
{"text":"PROS: None. CONS: Even more then Robert Irvine from Restaurant Impossible could fix.  1-AMBIANCE: Feels like dining in a not especially clean gasoline station; very uncomfortable hard chairs and bench seating; entering through the secondary entrance provides a full view directly into the dishwashing room; even on a slow Monday night valet parking is mandatory, no self-park option. 1-SERVICE: Slow and disorganized; food delivered to the table piecemeal; understaffed, our server who even prepared the table side guacamole tried his best, but being the only bartender on duty spent the majority of his time also mixing margaritas for the entire restaurant. 1-FOOD: Guacamole was one small avocado chopped with unidentified and unidentifiable ingredients served with flavorless corn chips; chile queso was a large glutinous mass so gummy as to be impossible to penetrate with the aforementioned chips; steak and eggs were a messy plate of food served with tater-tot-like potatoes instead of the advertised bolillo toast; inedible chile Costeno delivered with unmelted cheese and colder then room temperature. 1-VALUE: Least expensive margarita ( a small pour) for $7; guacamole $10.75; chile relleno for  $22; save your money and eat better food at Taco Bell. 1-OVERALL: Considering all the hype, not to mention the high prices, we should have received so much more; a huge disappointment.  WHAT WE ATE: Barrio Guacamole; Chile Queso; Steak and Eggs; Chile Costeno.  WHAT WE WISH WE ATE THAT WE DIDN'T: Not a thing."}
{"text":"We enjoyed some drinks and dinner with friends last night. The drinks were on point, I got a Hibiscus Marg wow SO YUM!! I'm craving it again today! I ordered cochinita tacos, they were DELISH! Everyone else ordered different dishes and all seemed happy and satisfied.   I'm only docking it one star because of the service, it was very slow. But I do have to give credit to the poor gal who was our server, waitress, bartender etc, she was pretty much a one man show and was still friendly! Probably not her fault that she was left solo.   Will definitely go back, I REALLY enjoyed the margs and food!"}
{"text":"The food is a great experience in your mouth. The unique flavors and taste combine to give your taste buds a welcome change from the normal restaurants. The desserts with churros was great and adding the fresh strawberries made a combination that tasted great.   Also this is a great place to bring family or just have fun and play the games here. A very welcome change. Try and you will learn that it is a fun experience."}
{"text":"My first time in Barrio urbano i ordered a guacamole and some fries love it ., then I bring my hubby and ohhh dear we went wild we ordered enchiladas, drinks flan and churros everything was on point .... I'll be back for more"}
{"text":"Food is excellent, its sorta out of place in the knuckle dragging confines of that complex  (because of the sub par restaurants that take up the majority of the yard)  The decor is very cool, and the tequila and staffs knowledge of that beverage are a happy addition to the outstanding food.   The valet recommend that I try out the guacamole dip, and my hats off to that young, pony tailed man.  I recommend everyone ditch the cheeseburgers and go to Barrio when heading to the Yard.  But Barrio at any location should probably be your destination any how."}
{"text":"So disappointed in Barrio Urbano Tacos pescado missed the mark. It tastes like I was eating a tuna fish taco with too many onions. The flavor profile was way off. My husband's Arizona burro had a lot of flavor. The table side guacamole was good but a little too chunky. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful staff, amazing margs. The green chile pork is a perfect touch of heat and flavor! Don't leave without trying one of the amazing desserts too!"}
{"text":"Al cien buen tiempo, buena jente, buena comida, i'll be back. Great waiters, great food will be back soon."}
{"text":"The wait for the check was definitely longer than the unreasonable wait for the food. The server was unaware of the back side of the menu...who's to blame here? The server on her first night or the management who didn't show her the back of the menu? The specials on Tuesday are good assuming you have all night to piss away"}
{"text":"Despite the average rating, we decided to try this place out and I am super happy we did! The Saudero Burrito is super yummy and super spicy. The quality of the meat is amazing also. We were very happy with this place and our server was such a good kid and helpful! Thanks again."}
{"text":"Came out for Angels spring training and found a new delightful Barrios  Really a great place with wonderful food and unbelievable service. I have eaten at Barrio cafe, but this is better (if possible) Ask for Shannon, exceptional service knowledge and wonderful personality  Thanks ur a great experience"}
{"text":"Having grown up Bi-Coastal I had the best of both Worlds all of my life, especially when it comes to food. There are many Mexican spots to enjoy here in Arizona, but NOTHING even comes close to the Fantasy Food delights of this place. Food should do two things to us when we eat it. The first is to make us love the taste of what we are eating and the second it to make us feel good with our friends over something special. This place brings me back to the days of eating the home cooked food of Los Angeles. A time when East LA was the place to eat delicious Mexican food. It was not only great to eat but the women cooking it turned it into an art form, with beautiful presentations and fresh in your face innovations of tastes and flavors. You are going to love this place! But please don't go there with the expectation of fancy Mexican dishes from some Trained Chef. This food is the product of the prideful Home Girl attitude that will knock you off your chair. Oh and while you are up the drinks are probably some of the best in the Southwest! My Family from Brazil and Friends from Acapulco Love this place! Trust me I am so sure of this place's level of quality that after you eat there call me on my private cell phone and tell me how much you agree with me... 602-373-9739 Craig"}
{"text":"A horror show from start to finish. The hostess was sweet and the margaritas were good but everything else was a disaster.  It feels as though Silvana has licensed her name and reputation to a place that bears no connection to her cooking or philosophy in any real way. It's like how you'll find the mass-produced crap at Marshall's or TJ Maxx with the Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren or Donna Karan name, but it's not really their stuff. This was mass-produced college dorm or food court Mexican food coming from a kitchen with seemingly no adult supervision. It was kids ladling bland, dry, overcooked, poor quality glop from troughs. Everything tasted like everything else. The \"vegetable\" was a pile of oily corn from a can. The food wasn't even warm when it arrived, and the dry, cold tortillas were broken - not a single one intact - and they were terrible quality. At the very least I expected homemade salsas or hot sauces, not the bottled garbage on the table.   I was looking forward to this meal, having grown up in Los Angeles and as someone who lives in a Mexican neighborhood in Brooklyn, and with Silvana's rep and the flashy website presentation - I was expecting something elevated and interesting, or at the very least, competently executed.  Another issue was the room/ambience. Charmless, poorly lit and designed, and I felt like our table was in some auxiliary waiting area rather than an actual place to eat dinner. It was hectic and uncomfortable, to say the least. And I can deal with casual, industrial and un-precious - this was just straight unpleasant.  Worst of all was our service. We waited over 20 minutes to order and the place wasn't even that crowded. Our server, I'll skip leaving her name here because she's already been mentioned on yelp as abysmal, was horrendously rude and incompetent. She finally took our order, didn't bring half the stuff we ordered and never mentioned it or apologized until I finally said something. She had no excuse, no apology, just said yeah, don't bank on it arriving. And it didn't. And she never asked us how we were, if we needed anything, if we'd like to know about the desserts, etc. She just slammed our check down and left.  This place feels like it's in its last days or something. I have to believe it's on the decline and at some point it was better because if it was always this terrible, its reputation and profile are puzzling, to say the least.   Major stinkfest."}
{"text":"Had a chance to check out this new Barrio concept at The Yard last week.  The food was definitely the best part, however took longer than normal, and was not very busy.  The service was below average, and no one even came over to take a drink order for 5-7 minutes after we were seated.  The server did not know they had Sol beer, even though it's on the menu.  Great ambiance with a ton of potential, but need to work out the service issues and timing with the kitchen.  The servers should memorize the menu if they know what's good for them.  Will give them another try in a couple months to see if they can work the kinks out."}
{"text":"Barrio Urbano is fantastic! I could eat here every week and be a happy person. I had the Torta de Asada with their fries. As soon as I took one bite, I was hooked. I'd also go back just for the fries which have a little kick to them. The portions were generous. I'll be having the second half of my Torta for dinner...I'm so excited! The service was quick, friendly and remarkable. My friends got the Gringa quesadilla and Arizona burrito. They were equally as thrilled about their meals. I'll definitely be going back there."}
{"text":"Ok, I love it here. The end. There is so much right going on with this place. I admit that most of the feelings that it brought for me dining there had to do with the flashbacks I got of my childhood in Texas.   Admittedly, the dishes are very much Silvana's creations,  however ask the ingredients come together to produce an explosion of nostalgia.  The drinks are great. I had the OG Margarita,  my mom had a mojito and both treated awesome. They have a variety of Mexican sodas, not just the typical coke.   I had the Maya torta, and is was awesome. It came with steak fries that had a chile seasoning on them that made all the difference. My mom had a Chile poblano relleno and my sister a torta asada.   The music they were playing was authentic Mexican abs not just rancheras, but pop and cumbias. I wanted to stay forever. The service was great. It felt very laid back. They do take a little longer than usual,  but we didn't mind. We enjoyed the experience very much. I love that it's at the yard, so the people watching situation is on point.   The only thing that I would like us not to have to use the valet parking. I rather park my own car, but i can see why they have that option since it gets so busy. Also, interesting bathrooms for anyone that hasn't been to the Yard before. They have separate stalls for men and women but the sinks to wash your hands are communal. Never thought is mind that, but it is slightly weird to look into the eyes of a guy in the mirror while washing my hands. Must be all the years of being conditioned for seperate bathrooms or maybe I shouldn't be staring into s man's eyes in the bathroom mirror.  Anyway, my point is,  come to Barrio Urbano, enjoy the awesome food,  but don't come here if you want to be in and out. It's not that type of place she that is perfectly okay."}
{"text":"We enjoy breakfast and lunch. The atmosphere is not noisy you can sit inside and out!  The service is fast and friendly and they have specialties and regular Mexican fare with additional modern ingredients twist!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Excess wait staff loitering around doing nothing but socializing. We had high expectations because we thought it was a Fox restaurant. It's not. And you'll see why when you eat there. Small servings. Bland guacamole. Chips average. Menudo had little tripe in it. Huge bone which was a waste of space. Price was okay on it. Won't return. Ever."}
{"text":"Went on a late night and sat at the bar. Had a margarita it was good  Shared with a friend a carne asada quesadilla, guacamole, and black bean dip... It was all very delicious that  fresh, organic yummy hipster tasting food.... One little thing that was insulting not only to my faith but culture. The holy trinity candles, are they using them as accessories! Not nice. Not going there again. R.E.S.P.E.C.T find out what it meant to me...."}
