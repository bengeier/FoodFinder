{"text":"Service: excellent Atmosphere: casual and friendly.  Food: 8.5 out of 10 overall. The penne alla vodka was absolutely perfect right down to the plump, delicious, perfectly cooked shrimp. Antipasto was very good and I especially enjoyed the pickled eggplant, having never had that before. The bread is a bit plainer than I'd like but did well when I used it to sop up every last bit of the pasta sauce. Caesar salad was yummmm.   For dessert, do not miss the lobster tails -- crispy filo cones stuffed with delicious custard. So good!  We'll be back."}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews on this place, my family and I were very excited to give it a try. Unfortunately, I have to say that we were somewhat disappointed with the experience. Perhaps they were having a bit of an off night? The servings were generous, but the food itself was pretty average. The pizza was decent. The rice balls were nicely done. The pastas, chicken dishes and appetizers that we had, however, were very rich and oily, but only moderately tasty. The minestrone soup was very bland.  Our server was very pleasant, but the service was incredibly slow, especially given that we were pretty well the only ones there. And we would have appreciated having the dirty dishes cleared, as looking at a pile of dirty dishes throughout a meal is not terribly pleasant. There was plenty of time to clear between courses and most of the dishes were still there even after the bill arrived.   All in all, I suspect that this may be an isolated experience,and hope that this was the case as I like to support local businesses, but it could have been much better and did not live up to the great reviews. Maybe another time."}
{"text":"HIdden gem at Danforth/Woodbine. 4.5 stars out of 5.  My hubby and I stumbled upon this restaurant during the late lunch period; truly there is nothing much in the Danforth/Woodbine area. But this restaurant not only serves authentic Italian food but also has the ambiance of a true Italian experience. The whole family works there, so you may be privy to passionate conversations amongst them at the bar. Loved it!  The decor is nothing to write home about, but it's casual. We ordered the Sabrina 20\" pizza (it was huge!) and minestrone soup. Both were delicious. You can tell it was all homemade.   Overall great and reasonably priced. I'd definitely return, this time to try their pasta!"}
{"text":"The service is friendly and warm - even on my first visit here, I felt as though I was being treated as family or at least a known, repeat patron. If the service set the right  mood, the food sealed the deal. The Antipasto for 2 was generous and fresh. The Penne a la Vodka with shrimp in a rose cream sauce was flawless. Filling without being stuffy and the flavors were distinct and fresh. For dessert, the Lobster Tails did not disappoint. Crisp and flaky pastry filled with a delicious custard. One chocolate and one vanilla - hard to choose which was my favorite. It's hard to say that any restaurant is 5 out of 5, and that is true even here. Everyone can find things that aren't perfect. But the overall experience was excellent and deserves a good review, and it is definitely worth making the trip to enjoy a meal here. I'll be back."}
{"text":"If you are craving the best pasta dish you will ever have, go here!!!! Decided to find the best pasta in Toronto and/or on the Danforth. Googled it and found this as a result with some amazing Google reviews. Tried it out!  Hard to see from the outside if you are driving and searching but it's much bigger than it looks from outside. Very clean! Nice decor, brand new cutlery, cloth napkins and the waitresses are very quick and extremely helpful!   The food is the best value for your money that you will ever find. You can tell the food is fresh, and because it is made from scratch, the wait time is just a TAD longer but so worth it!!!! They are willing to tweak menu its to your liking and have something for everyone. They have all sorts of pasta.  They have tons of people walking in for pick up and it's not hard to tell why!   Try the Rum Baba for dessert. You will not be disappointed!   I refuse to go anywhere else for pasta from now on! Love it.  They literallyyyyyy make their pasta and bread from scratch. It doesn't get any better. They also do the same with all of their sauces.  It is a family owned business and they are the most wonderful people!"}
{"text":"Very cute place - family run and good food.    People were friendly and the price is definitely right.  They do local delivery as well so I am excited to try their pizza next!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! 10/10. We had the ricotta spinach and onion pizza it was unreal. Then I went home with 4 cannollis that did not disappoint. Highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian meal. Probably the best puttanesca sauce I have ever tasted. Definitely highly recommended."}
{"text":"Conveniently located close to Danforth and Coxwell in a well-furnished little cafe. My husband and I like to visit for lunch when it's usually quiet so the atmosphere is cozy. The pizza is amazing. We've tried the Sabrina and most recently the Q4R. The 12\" pizzas are perfect to share but a hungry patron could eat one by himself. My husband is in love with the Veal Parmigiano Panini as it's a generous (tasty!) portion for a decent price.   The hazelnut cannoli is out of this world. They show a couple on the display but they keep the fresh ones either in the kitchen or behind the counter, so don't get scared off by the sad little pastries and cream out in front."}
{"text":"A friend ordered me a Lasagna which was even reheated from its frozen state and it was still one of the best Lasagnas I've ever had.  Why? Because they use fresh Ricotta cheese.    I'm hoping to go here one day and dine-in to try out some other menu items.  But for now, I will rate their Lasagna a 5/5."}
{"text":"I live nearby but somehow never really noticed this place before. A friend recommended it a few weeks ago, so we decided to try it out. What a pleasant surprise! We ordered 3 appetizers: the artichokes, anchovy bruschetta, and the arancini. All three were fresh and delicious. For my main I ordered the chicken calabrese, which was filled with more artichokes, olives, and peppers. Nothing was heavy or soaked in tomato sauce, the way so many Canadian Italian places prepare food. Just home-made goodness! The owner is warm and hospitable, just as you would expect from a family-run place. The prices are also very reasonable.  The restaurant could use a slightly cozier interior, given the kind of food that they make. I suspect that a lot of people walk by because it isn't particularly inviting. It's worth it to give it a try though!"}
{"text":"This was an option that we ventured into because of Yelp and it was well worth it. We had a great meal and the owner could not have been nicer, the food was excellent. You will be surprised..."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and beautiful decor. Relaxed and pleasant service. Excellent value. Enjoyed the pasta and pizza. Nice selection of desserts."}
{"text":"The place looks and feels authentic, but the food not so.  We had two dishes and both were well below par.  The rice in the risotto under cooked, and way to salty.  The pasta was suppose to be home made and fresh, but maybe in our case just home made.  I was expecting better tasting dishes for the price."}
{"text":"I love my Italian food and i love this place too.  My gf and I drove to actually get a rice ball from Colombo's but they were closed for good so we decided to check out Quattro.....and it was the best decision ever lol  Rice ball was so juicy inside but crispy on the outside....you didn't even need sauce it was that good!  food was cooked by...my guess the eldest daughter and the front was run by the rest of the family.  I will always support the family owned."}
{"text":"Good food but really too expensive for delivery!!!  The pizza size is ridiculously small for that price.  Cash only for delivery.  Maybe we'll try the restaurant once but definitely not the delivery mode anymore!"}
{"text":"We absolutely loved the bruschetta it was the best we have ever had, I was not a big fan of my spaghetti and meatballs but the carbonara was outstanding and wow the 'lobster tails' were just luscious and decadent."}
{"text":"Had dinner with a friend here. The place was comfortably crowded but they seated us with no problem on a Saturday night around 6:30.  We both enjoyed our meals a lot. I had the chicken parmigiana and would have liked to have had some vegetable along with the pasta but otherwise it was good. Very poor selection of beer. Something from a local brewery would be nice although they did have 2 Italian beers."}
{"text":"We decided to try some place different from our regular restaurants. We picked this place based on good Yelp reviews. When we first walked in, we were a little nervous. The place was completely empty on a Saturday night. We ordered one fried calamari for an appetizer. The calamari was quite good, but it didn't come with any sort of dipping sauce. It could have used an aioli or some tzatziki. They brought us two loaves of hot, fresh bread for the table, which were excellent. For the main course, we ordered a four cheese pizza for the kids to share. They absolutely loved it. My older daughter also had a huge Caesar salad which she loved. I got a lasagna and my husband got the Portobello chicken. Both were absolutely amazing. The lasagna reminded me of the best lasagna I used to have as a kid. The portobello chicken came smothered in a Gorgonzola sauce that was out of this world. The kids had their hearts set on cannolis for dessert and they each got a chocolate cannoli. My older daughter said it was the most delicious thing she had ever had in her life. I had the tiramisu, and it was, without a doubt, the best tiramisu of my life as well. The waitress told us that all the desserts are made in-house with the freshest ingredients, and you could really taste it! We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This place is in a small storefront right on the Danforth. There is not a lot of seating in the main restaurant, but it seems like there might be a downstairs portion. They also have a large display case of desserts, but on the two occasions I've been there, they were out of cannoli on both instances.   The first time I went here, I had a relatively positive experience. Not good enough to want to come back right away, but when it came up, I remembered thinking it was good. I visited for a second time tonight with my husband, and unfortunately, it was rather dismal. My husband ordered the arancini as an appetizer, which he liked. He had the seafood diabolo as an entree, which he said was \"edible.\" The bread was hot, but flavourless. I ordered the cheese ravioli, and this turned out to be a big mistake. It came out such that the pasta was cut really clumsily and thickly and not fully cooked. It took me eating one piece of ravioli to figure out what was going on and I bit into the second, trying to decide if it was worth saying anything.  It was close to the end of the night when we were there. When I noted that there was a problem to our server, she said that they could either cook it more if I could order something else. Then she disappeared for a long period of time, and when I finally saw her again, I asked what was going on with my meal. She said, \"Oh yeah, what do you want to do?\" I said that I did not think it would help for the pasta to be cooked more because part of the problem was the way the pasta was cut, not just how it was cooked.   Eventually the manager or owner was sent over. She made a rude comment about why I waited so long to decide there was a problem with my pasta, saying I'd eaten almost half of it. I told her that this was not true, and she argued with me about how many ravioli were on the plate (apparently there were supposed to be 6, but I only got 5). She told me that she could not cook me something else because they were closing, but would take it off my bill if I wanted them to. I said that this would be good, as I had hardly eaten anything and was still hungry!!!!!   My husband ordered a pastry, which he did not like enough to eat, so I ate it since there was no other food for me. After the manager cashed us out, she told me that the next time we came back, she'd make sure they cooked the ravioli until I was happy with it. As if there will be a next time!"}
{"text":"This place is truly amazing.  I struggled to find good restaurants on Danforth east of Pape which tend to be composed of 50 year old alcoholics drinking at noon.  However, Quattro 4 Ragazze is simply amazing.  It's owned by an Italian family and they all work there giving it an authenticity and old-world charm.  The kids cook and serve food also.  Reasonable prices.  My favorite was the Quattro Stagione [sp?] - Four Seasons in Italian - pizza.  Totally fresh - they make everything, even the dough.  I wish they delivered, but from talking to the owner, they only want to serve the best, most fresh things - hence the no delivery or it would hurt the quality.  You have to respect that!  However, I've reheated the pizza 24 hours later, and it's still great.  Check it out if you love tasty Italian food at a decent price."}
{"text":"A great place to eat with family and friends! We were 4 people, each ordered something different and we all loved it! I thought the wait for the appetizers qas a little too long, but was tolerable. They brought the mains fast enough and made up for it. The quality/price was very satisfying. An amazing discovery for me tonight!"}
{"text":"Their menu is essentially all traditional Italian with a predictable menu - which to me, is a good thing. Everything is very well prepared - old Italian style. Pastas, prima (appetizers/first courses), salads, soups, main courses and made-in-house breads and deserts to die for. If you are  big on red meat - try the veal or lamb. Quality cuts perfectly grilled over flame and a hungry man size at 13 oz..'s that will sit you back on your seat. Fairly priced for the area probably the only decent Italian restaurant in the entire Danforth area. It has a decent decor/ambiance and respectable. I have also had their thin pizza which is a bit expensive but very delicious. Their lunch veal sandwich is superb and a steal of a deal at $8. They do local delivery as well. Everything they make is good. Very recommended."}
