{"text":"I like the place. Good food. Price is right. Can't go wrong if you are looking for good Chinese food.  The older lady that works there was giving her employee crap in front of me and a couple of people.. It was not nice at how she did that in front of people. There service is kinda wonky lol. Don't get me wrong, its good food... I dont care about the rest lol"}
{"text":"My family have been avid consumers of asian food for as long as I can remember, and part of the reason of this love for asian food has largely been the influence Sam's Kitchen has played on our Chinese experience. The location is small, but that is to be expected since it is in the heart of downtown Whitby. This location is one Im very familiar with, and I can say that after years of testing out there menu, they have a wide variety of authentic options for everyone with a cultured tongue. Seafood dishes are savoury and flavourful, the fried rice dishes are filling and full of fresh ingredients, but what is most notable is the cantonese chow mein, which is delectable and bursting with colours through the use of fresh vegetables and natural ingredients. This has been a personal favourite, as we have ordered it a countless number of times and have even had it delivered to our house and different venues during special occasions (yes, they cater!). After years of attending this restaurant, I can say that the staff are exceptionally friendly and that the establishment's namesake is a gentleman who always shows service with a smile!  The great thing about this restaurant is there is no specific niche that the restaurant specializes in! Whether it's seafood, poultry or the wide variety of noodle options that are available, you can be sure that whatever you are enjoying is an authentic Chinese delicacy. If you're new to the Chinese experience and are are unsure about what you should try, Sam's menu provides a range of combination specials on his menu in both the traditional Cantonese and Peking styles.  Sam's kitchen proves that there are in fact good places in Whitby to try culturally diverse food, just be prepared for the small location and unfortunate lack of parking! When it comes to authentic Chinese cuisine, Im a fan of Sam!"}
{"text":"This Chinese restaurant in downtown Whitby is no good.  When we walked in there were a few teenagers sitting at a table, then one of them got up and greeted me \"for here or to go\" ever heard o saying hello to your customers first?  I let that one go and sat down to look at the menu anyway.  Aside from the table of teens, which are the owners kids who worked thete, we were the only table there.  We ordered 1 dish, cantonese chow mein.  It took over 20 mins for it to arrive and when it did, I have never had anything so salty in my life.  When the waitress, i assume the mom, came and asked how it was we said it was really salty and she smiled and went away.  We ended up pouring tea in our dish to wash some of the salt off.  We paid and when we were leaving they did not even look up to say thank you or good bye.  Bad food, but even worse service!"}
