{"text":"My family and I went to the Prime Rib Steakhouse for a birthday celebration and due to a recent Plain Dealer review.  I will forever question the capability and creditability of Plain Dealer food reviewers. We had a fairly horrible experience. Yes, part of the restaurant's draw is the tableside food preparation. The cold salad plates and chilled forks delivered were somewhat impressive; the spinning salad prep was interesting. However, the rest of the service was dismal at best.  There were two tables with customers in the entire restaurant (on a Sunday night).  We were one of the two tables. Perhaps a total of 8 people in the whole place plus two wait staff. The waiter brought us drinks spilling much of the red wine ordered on the tabletop. White tablecloths, he covered up the spill with a napkin.  He then suggested we study the menu for a while so he could talk to his other guests and finish with them.  The menu was a quick study, because the offerings are not that extensive nor complicated.   He kept forgetting how we wanted the prime rib prepared, we repeated medium -well three times, for all of us.   One order looked well-done, one medium - well and one medium.  He proceeded to serve the Yorkshire pudding and spilled that on the floor too.  My husband had to find the waiter to request our bill.  The food was basically mediocre - nothing particularly memorable.  The creamed spinach tasted like Stouffer's and the special seasoning like Lawry's salt.  Obviously, we will not be returning, not sure how long this place will actually stay in business."}
{"text":"Went there thanks to Groupon. Loved it. Decor very classy, service very attentive and friendly---and not just another steakhouse. Prime rib was terrific. And the place is quiet unlike a number of other places in town. Could actually hold a conversation. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went last night during a snowstorm, and I'm so glad we braved the weather!    The decor is luxurious and the background music felt like old time jazz that blended well into the background.  The food really was perfect.  A salad, mashed potatoes, and yorkshire pudding comes with every meal.  Obviously, they primarily serve prime rib, and you can add a lobster tail with that.  Their carver brings out a large cart of meats, prime rib at various levels of doneness, to your table. You order one of 6 or so cuts, the way you want it cooked, and it is plated right there, with all the extras and any sides you'd like.  It was fun to see, the food still tasted fresh (I was a tad concerned when I wad their large cart) and fabulous.  We had the vanilla creme brule and the New York Cheesecake.  Both were the best I've tadted in at least a decade.    On top of all this, the service was warm and wonderful.  In short, this excellent restaurant almost makes me want to move back to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"We get a Groupon for the Prime Rib Steakhouse also. We order Prime ribs and is very good maybe the best I ever have. The service is very good also."}
{"text":"I know they are closed now but this was one of the first restaurants we went to after arriving in Cleveland.  Unlike the other reviews, we thought it was outstanding.  Everything we had was spot on.  The server was attentive and our food took a little longer but it was well worth it.  We were so sorry to hear that they closed."}
{"text":"I purchased the Groupon for Prime Rib Steakhouse, and wish I saved my money. We were one of 3 tables in the restaurant on a Friday night (never a good sign) and we quickly learned why. The service is so slow, they were out of the 2 things we wanted (pork chop and shrimp for the pasta), the menu was different than the one online, the food was well below average, and it was extremely overpriced. There is also a $5 charge if you are going to use the Groupon and you order the filet mignon (we couldn't find this mentioned anywhere on the Groupon). It also took them forever to bus tables, giving the restaurant a sloppy appearance. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Went last Sunday after seeing a groupon deal and was pretty excited to try The Cleveland Prime Rib Steakhouse.  In short, there were only 2 tables including ours at 6pm on a Sunday Night and we had one of the worst servers ever!  He seemed to be drunk or impaired some other way. He stumbled though our orders and finally brought us bread after 45 minutes of waiting and he was overall very uncomfortable to be around. In short we came very close to leaving, but we had Prime Rib on our mind and decided to stay. However, the Chef did come out to check on us and she was very professional and friendly.    The Food, well they basically only serve Prime Rib, a seafood option, and vegetarian dish.  Each one of us at my table got Prime Rib and we all enjoyed the food.  It comes with Mashed Potato's, Yorkshire Pudding, and a salad.  Overall, the food was very good and made up a lot for the inabilities of our server.  The Prime Rib was well seasoned, juicy, and thoroughly enjoyed by all of us.  The salad was excellent and comes with an excellent house dressing.    I would have given 4 stars, but our server ruined that for us.  I would recommend trying this place and I probably will be back, just not on Sunday Night.     P.S. I also thought that this place cut the Prime Rib on a cart in front of you, but they didn't and don't know if they do.  If you've been to Lawry's you know what I am talking about."}
{"text":"I'm torn between giving Prime Rib Steakhouse three and four stars and went with three because while I had a good experience and would recommend it, I'm not sure that I would go again.  My initial thought upon entering was that I liked the deep red walls.  Elegant, but hip.  I also noticed the funky/modern lighting above the bar area.  Then, I noticed the very traditional and quaint lighting just across the room, above the main seating area.  The fact that the styles of lights clashed so much might not bother most people, but I couldn't get over it.  I think they should take out the more traditional little lamps and replace them with similarly modern lighting to uniform the place.    I went with my boyfriend.  He was very excited about his prime rib...I had never ordered prime rib before!  The first part of our meal was bread and butter, no complains there.  I ordered a signature martini and he had a glass of zinfandel.  I liked my martini (the pink orchid) but should have gone with wine to better accompany the steak, especially since I was drinking it throughout the course of meal as it was a bit on the sweet side, even for the drink's description.   The meal: The spinning salad bowl is totally unnecessary--a show that does not impress.  Our server forgot her salad tossers which also \"ruined the show\" (her words).  We were given chilled salad forks and salad plates straight from the freezer.  Do people really care that their salad is getting warm?  Because I am a person with sensitive teeth anyway, these little touches had the opposite effect on me--I could barely eat my salad--it was way TOO cold!    The prime rib-mobile (my boyfriend's term) came out after our salads and we watched the chef carve our cuts.  I had the smallest option, the California Cut, and my boyfriend had one of the larger ones.  The prime rib-mobile served our steaks and our sides and rolled away.    The verdict on the prime rib: good!  Flavorful.  I enjoyed it, but I am not a huge steak eater in general and only ate about half of my cut (which was the one for \"lighter appetites\" to begin with).  When the server came to take our plates, she pointed at it with both hands and said \"What happened?!  Something went wrong?\"  I'm sure it's rare that people come to this place and don't finish most of their plates, but it's not like I barely touched it, and if I hadn't found what she said so funny, I would have found it awkward.  I told her that I was saving room for dessert.  (Another reason I was probably unique in this restaurant!)  For dessert we shared the chocolate cake, which they SHOULD advertise as a chocolate torte-lava cake.  It came with ice cream and strawberries and was a very good ending.  We finished it all even though we were both quite full.    Near the end of our meal, the prime rib-mobile got wheeled down the steps directly behind us by the chef, who apologized for the noise in advance.  CLUNK CLUNK CLUNK CLUNK CLUNK....you'd think they could wait until everyone leaves to move the kitchen-on-wheels out of the way?    The servers were nice, the food was good, and the ambiance pleasant as well, though a little mis-matched!  We didn't even realize that it was restaurant week.  They had a good deal but there weren't many people in the restaurant taking advantage of it--there were probably 9 people total while we were there.  Come on, Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Amazing friendly service. Excellent food. Have been three times. I would highly recommend it. Discover this great yet to be discovered gem. Easy to get a table. Great atmosphere and music."}
{"text":"One word review: bland. Two word review: bland & awkward.  Let me start by saying I'm very familiar with the Prime Rib Steakhouse's concept.  Lawry's in Dallas/Chicago and The House of Prime Rib in San Francisco are the same idea.  Those restaurants are amazing.  Prime Rib Steakhouse - not so much.  Everything about PRS is laughable.  On all of their advertising, they highlight the \"show\" that starts with a spinning salad bowl and then prime rib carved at your table.  What a joke, and in our case, an awkward joke.  When our salad arrived, we were in the middle of a conversation (our table being a jovial group of 6) when the server loudly and said \"(loudly) Excuse me!!.....(quietly) your spinning salad.\"  The show was a bowl of salad spinning on ice.  Something you could do at home?  yes.  Something you'd take the time to do at home?  God, I hope not.  Now, to the food.  Honestly, none of it was bad.  But whereas the House of Prime Rib in San Francisco has served me the best prime rib I've ever eaten AND the best sides I've ever eaten (Yorkshire pudding, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, in their case), PRS did not.  The prime rib was bland.  The sides were forgettable at best, mediocre at worst.  What it comes down to is that when I go to a restaurant like this, I'm going for the food.  And I hold PRS to the same standard I hold any steakhouse - give me a great cut of meat and some good sides.  The show is a gimmick (and a poor one at that) that would never get me in the door or to return.  For me to go back, it would only be for the food and in Yelp's 2-star words, the food is \"meh.\""}
{"text":"Prime Rib Steakhouse delivered a really good prime rib steak with great service in a classy surrounding.  The sides, unfortunately, were not as equal to the task, and I couldn't help but notice that no more than four people dined at the restaurant on a perfectly good Thursday night.  I'll start with the main feature:  The prime rib--carved tableside inside a gigantic metal cart--is great.  I don't think I've had USDA Prime rated prime rib before, but the difference in quality and juiciness of the meat was noticeable.  I also think having the cut with the bone added to the flavor--contrary to what I've written in one of my other steakhouse reviews (about a bone-in ribeye).  I definitely give two thumbs up for what I had: The Queen Elizabeth I--a 10 ounce cut (which I had cooked medium rare).  The rest of the food was not nearly as impressive:  The meal starts with a salad, also served tableside where they toss the salad by spinning it in a metal bowl set on top of some ice inside another metal bowl.  For all that show, the taste of the salad was decent but nothing particularly remarkable--better than an ordinary restaurant side salad with the house herb vinaigrette but nothing special in itself.  When you do get your steak, you also get a serving of mashed potatoes and gravy and a bowl of Yorkshire pudding, which is like a bread or pancake that they suggest you use to mop up the au jus.  Again, neither was particularly good; I would have hoped for significantly better mashed potatoes because that side is included with every prime rib dinner.  I do recommend getting another side to share, but the Creamed Spinach we selected was pretty plain as well.  My meal with a chocolate lava cake, served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, which was actually pretty good.  The New York style cheesecake also received very positive reviews.  The service at Prime Rib Steakhouse takes a formal tact, and it was a lot better than I expected.  Granted, we were two of only four people in the restaurant the entire time, but our server was very courteous and accommodating.  Each little thing the staff did--from wiping the edges of the plate after the prime rib is placed on it or serving the salad tableside--is done deliberately (almost ceremonially, really).  I particularly liked the touch of providing a chilled fork for the salads--why should I be tortured with salad that could be warmed by my own utensils?  On the downside, there was an inordinately long wait between our salad and main course, though my suspicion is that the prime rib cart actually makes service faster if the restaurant were more crowded.  A final note on the space itself:  They certainly did a good job remodeling the old House of Cues.  I didn't like the smaller booths, though, which are quite cramped--probably great if you're a couple enjoying a special occasion but not quite as good if you're there for a two-person business dinner.  Needless to say, we ended up moving to a regular table."}
{"text":"Service was great, quick and attentive. The food was hot and delicious. Presentation with the prime rib cart was different, it was cool to see them actually cut your piece of prime rib right off the bone. I would recommend spending the extra few dollars and getting at least the Cleveland cut. The only negative is that the atmosphere could be a bit more lively.  If you like prime rib, this place is a must try."}
{"text":"I've been here on 2 occasions, both of which I had Groupon deals for. Each time I've been in were weekend nights, and they weren't busy at all.   The ambience is wonderful. You feel like you're in a New York steakhouse. It's grand, elegant, and hip all at the same time. You can see the carts that hold the delicious beef , and they do slice it right in front of you.   The service is great. I read some bad reviews on the waiters, but the one i had was extremely attentive and nothing but pleasant.   And the food? It's a very simple menu, which is a good thing in my eyes. A place called prime rib steakhouse shouldn't be selling a dozen types of pasta and million other things. They offer prime rib cuts, seafood, or a vegetarian option. Salad is spun before your very eyes and it's excellent. The meat is cooked perfectly and seasoned well. They do their staple menu item pretty damn well. Sides are extra, and I have no experience with those because I'm full from the large Cleveland cut, mashed potatoes, and airy bread.   For prime rib, I think the prices are pretty reasonable. I think the only reason it's not very busy is because most aren't willing to pay that much for a dinner. But again, it's a prime rib dinner. Treat yourselves, people!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. They had five tables of people but it took them over an hour to get my table our food. When we asked why, they said it was because they were \"busy.\" It looked like the entire place was being run by two people. I predict they won't be in business six months from now."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience at Prime Rib Steakhouse. The decor was beautiful, waiter was very attentive and the steak was out of this world, not to mention the fresh spun salad and cheesecake to die for!"}
{"text":"The flavouring on the food was very good however I noticed it to be a bit salty across the board, perhaps owing to the ajus. The waitress was very nice and good and the lady she was training was very nice as well although she was not quite getting the hang of it (she did several things our main waitress then fixed such as put the knives in the wrong spot on the table). The salad which is included with all meals is prepared table side which was very cool. This however is one area where the concept could be improved on. The waitress faces the table with the large salad bowl in front of her tray and the plates she serves it on behind the big bowl preventing you from seeing it very well. For all the work she does with the tomatoes she could do this in front of the bowl so the guests can see. As with the large cart the chef brings out to serve the main courses - this could be improved too. The chef greeted us but then his back was to us and he did not look back or explain what he was doing, the cuts of meat or anything. For all the trouble of brining out the huge cart the chef should at least face the guests and say some speech about the meat. The whole idea of ordering ahead of time seems odd to me since the various items to order are just various thickness of prime rib which could be decided on table side. I also did hear the waitress tell another table they had run out of filet. I ordered one and there were three separate occasions where it was too fatty to chew.... Mashed potatoes come with all the mains as well. I ordered a broccoli side ($6.99) and requested no potatoes and when the bill came I was not charged for the side so that was nice..."}
