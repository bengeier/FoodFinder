{"text":"Bad non existent service ..... warm beer .....really cold food [ that is supposed to be hot ] crappy staff"}
{"text":"Don't come for the food!  Service was fine but the food was not. Ordered the chorizo tacos for dinner. When they arrived, it was obvious they reheated old meat in the microwave because it was dry and crusty. The soft shells were cold too. I was afraid to send it back for fear of what they'd do to it before it came back or ordered something else. My friend ordered a standard cheeseburger and was undercooked. At least the beer was cold. Plenty of other better restaurants in the area just a block or so away. I just wished I had walked a little further that night."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food terrible. 
I ordered garlic Parmesan wings. I saw the  waiter bringing them out, some of them fell on the tray and he turned around and put them back on my plate and tried to serve them to me. Those of you who don't work in a restaurant, a tray is used to transport drinks as well as dirty plate ware and glassware. Gross!!
I ordered the mount Edna burger medium. 
Came out well done, minus the fresh basil and provolone patty had clearly sat around for a bit. 
My advice? Don't bother."}
{"text":"The tacos had cheese wiz on it. Pizza is raw. I never got the food I ordered and the drinks were watered down. I'd say skip this place"}
{"text":"I came here with my family and tried 4 different pizzas and they were all very good. The chicken teriyaki was my favorite (just a special unfortunately) and we also had the veggie, plain cheese and margherita. The service wasn't great, but our server was very nice and we did get our food quickly. 

Another bonus- the beers were VERY inexpensive. I got a tall pumpkin beer for $2.50! Very impressive especially downtown."}
{"text":"Only bar downtown without a huge crowd for the World Series. Ordered the \"magnum\" wings. Smallest wings I have ever gotten in a restaurant. They look like they came from a cornish game hen. I don't like being deceived. Maybe the next bar that opens up in this spot will finally be something good."}
{"text":"Great food and service. We all tried something different and shared. Food and service was A+. The pizza, sliders, wings, cheeseburger. We're well prepared and whoever is the Chef makes it great point to insure great tasting food. Great place before the game - just across the street.  All of us will be back 
BEH"}
{"text":"The service was excellent but the food was below mediocre. Boiled ribs tossed on a grill for a minute and flavorless too sweet sauce on the pasta. Plus exorbitant prices for the quality."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! They are right across from Progressive Field and are the perfect alternative to louder more obnoxious sports bars- plus, Brickstone has better food. It's quiet but not awkwardly so. One side has a full bar and the other side of the restaurant will soon be hosting jazz/blues bands according to our server. Good selection with brick oven pizzas, sliders, a few burgers, other sandwiches, and pastas. The fries are to die for! Everything has an extra special touch that you don't usually find at places near a ball park. Two people, $25. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Disappointed, sign said brats $2.00 beer $4.00 should come to 6.00, yes?  No, it cost 10.48.  No apology, guess what, no tip either."}
{"text":"A small group of us decided to grab some food here after an Indians game. I ordered a soft pretzel appetizer and a cheese pizza. The pretzel was supposed to come with beer cheese and honey mustard. When it came out, there was only the mustard. When I asked about it, I was told they were out of the beer cheese and there was no way to discount on it! She obviously tried to pass it off and would have never mentioned it if I hadn't said anything. If I had known in the first place, I wouldn't have ordered it! Also, for being called \"Brickstone,\" I thought it was strange that they only offered a limited pizza menu (only cheese and pepperoni!) for game days. Definitely better restaurants around."}
{"text":"I was  in Cleveland for the first time over Memorial weekend to attend the White Sox and Indians game on 05/28/2018.  We came to Brickstone after the game to get a couple drinks and something to eat, it was the worst service I have ever experienced. There were no more than 10 people in the whole bar at the time and the waitresses just kept walking past us as if we were not there, we literally waited 20 minutes and as of yet no one came to take our order, the waitress stood behind the bar just looking at us. We thought it must have been because we were wearing Chicago White Sox gear, but regardless it was very unprofessional we got up and left. They made us feel very uncomfortable this is no way to run a business no matter what your team preference is. If I can give negative stars I would. We ended up going to Wing Stop down the street and it was great! I'm glad we didn't spend any money here."}
{"text":"Let's start this review with the positives. The food is delicious! Pulled pork tacos were best I have had outside a BBQ restaurant. Their burgers are also above average. The sweet potato fries were a treat, as they were serve with cinnamon and brown. 
Now for the glaring negatives! For the lack of patronage, it was the slowest serves I have ever experienced! We waited around 10 minutes just to be asked for our drink order. Then we ordered an appetizer and were not inform of the kitchen being out of that item until about 5 minutes before our meal being brought out. Therefore our replacement appetizer came out mid meal. All that being said the serves were friendly. 
Better service would have made this a 4/5."}
{"text":"I Visited for opening day and had a blast..You have to try the  pizza...I love the tribe and love  to stop by  the  brickstone on the  way to the game"}
{"text":"Slowest service I have ever experienced!

That was the main sticking point that had our party of 4 upset.  We were the only table ordering food when we were there.

What irked me was that I had ordered some Mac and cheese, and what was put in front of me was no better/different than if I had made myself a box of Velveeta shells and cheese.  Not worth the time, or money."}
{"text":"Stopped in earlier this week for dinner. I called ahead to see what time they closed. I suggest this if there isn't a sporting event since they closed at 8 the night I went. I like this spot. I thought they did a good job with the bar and remodel and hear they are planning on artwork or a mural for the walls. Out server was awesome. Was very informative and helpful. I got a glass of wine and my man friend picked a beer from their list.

Food. Calamari was great. I like spice and banana peppers so for me that was a plus. The short rib pizza was bomb. Already decided we would try a basic pizza next time. My side salad was generous and also presented nicely.

Highly recommend Brickstone for dinner and would try their event room. Excited to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  HORRIBLE service even though we were the only ones in the whole restaurant. Server took forever, he was no where to be found for refills on drinks etc., brought out the food after waiting forever for it and to top it off everything was cold.  Terrible.  The food was presented very nice and probably was average tasting if it wasn't cold.  Plus we paid with a gift certificate and server never bothered to give us back the remaining $.  Would not recommend to anyone that's for sure."}
{"text":"Wouldn't revisit, tried because of proximity to Progressive Field. The hostess was pleasant and our waitress was too at first. We ordered a couple drinks, ballpark nachos, and wings. Our nachos were nothing too rave about, missing tomatoes and jalape√±os. Also very light on beans. Very dry, had better down the street. The wings were very good however we were shorted (supposed to be 8 per menu). We politely asked waitress, she said she'd correct it. Next time we saw her she handed us the bill. We then spoke with hostess. In a few minutes, our waitress came back with corrected wings and said in a rude manner that she is not responsible for food only serving. And proceeded to be short while collecting check etc. We never said it was our waitress's fault just that she help rectify the situation. Needless to say we will not be back."}
{"text":"Definition of average.

Average food. 
Average service.
Average decor/ambience. 

This building is becoming a restaurant graveyard, when will these folks learn? Here, in the Gateway District you have a wood fire pizza grill trying to be fancy, but doing it while only attracting stadium and arena fans.

All the servers are in black button down shirts with neck ties, while they look professional, they don't deliver the level of service you'd expect to come with the image they convey. Heck, I'd venture to say there were two or three servers that were better when this place was called Cooperstown and Local Heroes, but they're now long gone since the Goodfellers restaurant experiment. 

My partner in crime and I had a 90-minute lunch break, when we first say down we didn't think they could ever serve is in time as it took a while just to get menus. 

We explained to the server that we were limited on time and she was good about getting us out.

We had a four cheese pizza, and a burger.  Both very average.  Burger's fries were terrible. Kinda like a restaurant serving Burger King fries."}
{"text":"Good food, nicely prepared and presented. From the way it came out it seemed like the person either wanted it to be good, or had at least been trained well. I sat at the bar and the bartenders were friendly an attentive. The braised short rib pizza is bangin. Good beer selection too, but you have to go to bottles to get anything unique or special. Overall nice place good food a drink. I'd recommend it to a friend, but not sure I'd make a point of going back. I visit Cleveland periodically for work. If I lived here it would likely make its way into the regular rotation. Good food, good beer, nice atmosphere and decent value."}
{"text":"Had a great meal before the tribe game. BBQ pizza was awesome and they really took care of us!"}
{"text":"The Cavs game (game 3 vs Golden State) just started and I have no ticket so I stopped in. Very glad I did. Got a grilled chicken salad and it was fantastic.cooled perfectly and very fresh. Server was terrific. Wish I got her name to say thanks but I didn't."}
{"text":"The pizza is above average. The decor is kinda a joke. They don't have any artwork up and they don't have decent signage outside. It seems like they launched before they were ready. They also had a crappy band playing way too loudly. I would rather have Sirius/XM than some suburban band playing at AC/DC levels. Decent beer selection. The buildout looks pretty minimal other than the pizza oven in the lobby which is awkward because the staff doesn't talk to you and it makes it hotter than it should be. I give them 6 months before they are the next Goodfellers, Local Heroes, or Cooperstown."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Alot of parking.  Perfect location to explore the night in downtown Cleveland. Absolutely loved the best and drinks."}
{"text":"This place is much better for drinking on the patio. Service was efficient and friendly. Decent beer selection. Nice patio and just a few steps to the Jake. It will always be the Jake to me.

The food on the other hand is mostly pre-made stuff you can get from any food service supplier. It's pretty much heat and serve."}
{"text":"I was here earlier with my boyfriend food was great! Service was good, we got sat by a side door which was terrible if I wanted to eat my food and be cold I'd ask for a table outside! Sad part it was employees going outside to smoke!"}
{"text":"Don't go to this place. Terrible food. Long wait. Warm beer. Had to have food taken off out bill because it was inedible. Ordered a pizza and was told we couldn't have it for an hour. Had to run outside to get cold drinks and come back to our table. Nacho cheese was cold out of the fridge."}
{"text":"Ok so here we go on this place. So this is your typical sports bar. Nothing fancy. Service wasn't the greatest. We saw our waitress like 3 times. Menus, beer and checks. We usually stop at Wilberts before the game but we decided to stop here because it was close. Tater tots were good beer was cold but as for service they get 2 stars."}
{"text":"Can't really speak for the general atmosphere as I came for a catered event, but I enjoyed the event and the services. The staff working the event were attentive, and I imagine they would be very attentive when working normal tables or the bar as well. 

As for the food, the pasta was pretty good (I prefer a saucier sauce and their sauce was more a light coating but plenty of spices and veggies) and the pizza was quite tasty. Some unique combinations and a solid amount of toppings--and plenty of cheese! I like my pizza to be oooooooooooozing toppings (probably why I'm in the deep dish camp of the spectrum), so I appreciated the hearty toppings :)

I'd like to return during baseball season, either for lunch before a Sunday game or for dinner afterwards!"}
{"text":"Ate here before an Indians game on a Wed. Night. We arrived around 5 and were seated right away. Our servers were very fast and attentive. Between the 4 of us we had pizza, burger, and a chicken sandwich. Nothing was outstanding; pretty average fare, but it satisfied our needs at a reasonable price and couldn't be any closer to the ball field for convenience."}
{"text":"Great pour of wine. Tasty bourbon rub on the wings. The cheese sauce was delicious. Great service from Tanea (I hope I spelled her name somewhat correct). She was attentive and helpful"}
{"text":"Everything Could be better. Ordered he berry salad w chicken, hardly no lettuce w load of berries, the spinach dip could've been better. I probably won't visit again..."}
{"text":"In town for work...and happened to arrive on the night of an Indians game! Managed to get up to the bar and order a gluten free margarita pizza to go. Its amazing! The pizza doesn't even taste \"gluten free\". If you eat them regularly, you know what I mean. Bartender was right, the place might be crazy due to Indians game, but the pizza is awesome!! I'd give 5 stars for the pizza, but took off one star as I sat at a table for over 15min prior to going up to the bar- and no one came over. Even with a crowd that's not cool. But I love the pizza - so I'll be back for sure during my stay."}
{"text":"Food tastes like Cafeteria food.  I think the Pizzas are frozen.  The whole restaurant was full of unbussed empty tables when we arrived and we had to search for a clean table, finally finding one in the back."}
{"text":"A great place to stop before or after a game! Very good pizza and giant, must have pretzels!"}
