{"text":"Reviewed café for my espresso blog blog - I am typically very skeptical about having espresso in a place that has any other focus other than coffee as I often find that espresso usually lacks the attention it requires. For example, I never order espresso in a restaurant. A friend that I met at the recent espresso tasting, recommended that I check out Krepesz in Kesington Market, as he had tasted some of the best espressos outside of Crema in Toronto.   I took his recommendation seriously, and I am happy that I did because it probably would have taken me a lot longer to find Krepesz by myself. Before I actually paid a visit, I did a little research through the Krepesz website which discusses the seriousness with which they take coffee including 49th Parallel beans, a Synesso machine, and professional training by Geoff Polci. Yes, he is the owner of Crema, one of my favourite places in Toronto.   Now, before going any further, I have to break another one of my rules. When I started this blog, I said that I would stick to reviewing espressos, and that I wouldn't be discussing pastries. Well rules are made to be broken, and I promise you the circumstances are exceptional. I grew up in Romania until about the age of 6. One of the fondest memories that I still having was spending summer vacations with my grandmother in the mountains in Transylvania. When I was well behaved, we would go down to the village and get a freshly baked Kurtos Kalacs, a Transylvanian specialty.  Essentially, this is a really buttery dough that is wrapped around a wooden form and basted with more butter, sugar, and cinnamon for good measure and than roasted over a hot charcoal barbecue. Certainly a deperature from the low-fat, organic, gluten-free, vegan, free-range fare that some cafés seem to promote these days. How was the kurtos kalacs at Krepesz? No they don't roast over a charcoal barbecue, but use a specially made oven. But nonetheless, My two-year old daughter had to be stopped after devouring three quarters of the large pastry, so that her Dad could have a taste. She was right. It was that good. Krepesz does also specialize in Hungarian style crepes, but reviewing those would be breaking my rules too much.  I have not had the current iteration of Epic Espresso at home or in other cafes. So a relative comparison is not possible, but I will say that this shot had more layers and complexity than any shot in memory, and I found it very satisfying in keeping in the tradition of great balance and sweetness combined with a long aftertaste of chocolate and stone fruits. The part that surprised me was that I took three sips, and each sip produced different tones including some brighter berries and citrus in the front, followed by some vanilla and flower tones, finishing with a bit of caramel blackcurrant highlights. I found the layers quite surprising and especially challenging upfront with brightness.  This review is slightly biased becuase of the kurtos kalacs which evokes childhood memories, but I can assure you that I have had a very nice shot. The dedication to quality is not only in the equipment and coffee used, but the careful preparation is dilligently followed by the owners who have been trained by one of Toronto's top. I also believe that the family ownership and involvement will result in this careful training to be maintained which is not as consitent in shops with high barista turnovers."}
{"text":"Came here and got the crepe & coffee deal for $10. It's limited the nutella banana crepe and cappucino/americano. I opted for the cappucino & added ice cream to my crepe for $1. Normally the crepes are $7.97.  Thought both were great. The crepe itself was soft and had thin slices of banana in the middle with nutella drizzled on top. Simple and satisfying.  The espresso beans are from 49th Parallel which brings me back to Vancouver so needless to say, I also enjoyed my cappucino.   This place as ample seating inside and outside on their patio with a variety of sweet & savoury crepes.   Great place for dessert."}
{"text":"Iced Americano was good. Better than Bull Dog's for price and quality (less ice). Chicken stew crepe was so so although it was supposed to be their signature item as they say. Crepe was a little soggy as I would usually prefer a bit crispier one.  Overall OK but not enough to make it as a destination for me."}
{"text":"Had the chocolicious and it was good! I could actually taste the nutella because the crepe was the right thickness. I ended up returning two days later, but this time the crepe was too crispy as if it had been left on for too long. I told the waiter and he fixed the solution right away. i was given a second and it tasted a lot better. Excellent and friendly service.   Loved the hipster environment. I'd definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I always make sure to get a Cortado coffee at Krepesz (strange name, I know) when I'm the Kensington/Spadina area. The ambient music is really good as well. Only tried crepes once, they were really tasty - crispier than the standard french crepes. I loved it!"}
{"text":"Probably the best crepes in the city right now.  The crepes are light, airy and evenly browned and just a little crispy around the edges, exactly the way they are supposed to be, just like in France, except these are Hungarian style, which is just a little bit better imo.  The crepes are made to order, not like a lot of other places that reheat pre-made crepes - that little detail alone is worth the price of entry.  I had a latte with mine, big surprise, it was the best latte I had outside of my house in years.  This place is the real deal, go there now!"}
{"text":"Had the strawberry banana  Nutella crepe it was thin and crispy on the edges and quick service! Would recommend for an afternoon treat"}
{"text":"Visited them a few days ago while on a food crawl in Kensington market with friends. We tried a sweet crepe(I am Chocolicious - with a scoop of ice cream) and a savoury one (I am Peaceful; Tito style - crisped outer cover with cheese), we loved both of them.   The groupon made it an amazing value. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place should be called Crappiest, not Krepesz.  The tasteless crepe was loaded with flour and water and should have been called 'paste' as it had no bearing to an actual crepe.  The latte had absolutely no discernible taste of coffee.  If you want a good crepe, go to 'Crepes-a-go-go' or 'Cafe Crepe'.  We were underwhelmed to say the least.  The saving grace was being able to sit outside on a beautiful day.  Krepesz does have outside seating, which is a good thing."}
{"text":"A friend told me that this place served the best savoury crepe she has ever tasted ... with that in mind, I couldn't wait to try it out.  Tried the Hungarian Chicken Stew crepe ... I was a little disappointed.  The chicken was ground chicken and tasted a little \"white\" aka dry.  The paprika sauce was not as savoury or fiery as I would have liked ...  The setting itself is quite nice.  We dined on the patio and it was a pleasant experience.    I think my problem is I expect a mind blowing, life altering, taste buds exploding type of experience when people tell me its \"the best\"....    It is a very cute place :)"}
{"text":"Came by on Wednesday after work for a drink with my girlfriend. We ordered a pitcher of sangria on the patio. The location is great, the drink was nothing out of the ordinary and the people were nice enough.  Nothing much to rant about this place. Not sure if I'll be back though - food didn't seem that appealing."}
{"text":"The best part about Krepesz is the location and patio. It's the perfect spot to stop on a walk thru the market on your way up toward College St. and relax with a delicious coffee. The lattes here taste delicious and served in a nice porcelain cup, although I prefer a larger one to keep the heat in until the last sip. I haven't tried the food yet, but it looks yummy, especially the sweet rolled up Hungarian pastry on the counter, covered with sugar. Great service, just go in and order and they will bring it to your seat. Recommended."}
{"text":"Love the grungy run down hipster neighbourhood. Tried a 'chocolicious' crepe with Nutella and strawberry+ bananas. Amazing combo - can't really mess up That winning combination. Outdoor seating is nice! Savoury crepes looked delicious.   I like the area but I'd try another dish next time just to try something different"}
{"text":"Nutella &Banana Crepes... yum!   It's a cute store, I enjoyed my time there with friends, but it isn't the best if you're looking for a great dessert place :)"}
{"text":"I had a very good experience here!    The crepes are freshly made and they do not skimp on the fillings.    We sat on the patio which is cute and gives just enough shade on a hot summer/fall Pedestrian Sunday.    Pet friendly as our neighbouring table had a pup and they even brought out a water dish for the little guy.    Service was friendly and attentive, even with the use of a Groupon!"}
{"text":"Stopped here to have coffees and Chimney cake with two friends. Was surprised that the Chimney take and any coffee was $5.00 considering that some of the coffees were listed as being around $4.00 indiviudally. The Americanos were quite nice and the Chimney cake a nice doughy treat with lots of powdered sugar. I'll be back to try the crepes."}
{"text":"I LOVE CREPES BUT I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE!  My girlfriend had to use the restroom so we stopped by. I was asked couple of time as I waited for her if I wanted anything, I looked at the menu but didn't feel like anything because we just ate.   As we were walking out one of the waitress yells \"Don't come back here again, the washrooms are only for customers!\"  1) I thought I was a customer because I came here couple of times with friends before.  2) I don't think the policy is good for business and I don't like it but I respect it. She could have came up to me in private and told me of the policy instead of yelling it out as I was leaving, very classless.  I don't get that attitude anywhere (rare times when I go in to places to just to use the restroom) but Kensington would be the last place I would expect it. Not cool.  Would never go back again and I plan to tell the story to anyone that talks about this place."}
{"text":"Great place for an evening tea and snack.  My friends and I were sad (and still a little hungry) after a disappointing dinner (see my last review) and wanted some dessert to make us feel better.    Enter Krepesz.  Cosy cafe with lovely art, terrific jazz (from a swank docking station), lovely tables and a smiley lady offering crepes.  What could be better?  We split a Nutella and banana crepe and a chocolate and cherry crepe.  Both came quickly and hot.  Our tea was fragrant, our crepes were sweet, chewy and crispy.  Service was kind and unobtrusive.  Conversation was great.  Highly recommended.  Oh, and according to my friend, the hot chocolate is great."}
{"text":"Delicious crepes, I tried peaceful and my husband had classic. We both enjoyed our crepes. Very nicely made with good ingredients. The staff and atmosphere is good but it is bit expensive for a casual breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"A few things: My husband and I are vegetarians. We also love Hungarian food.  We stumbled upon this place, while trying to find a place to eat and warm up. We both got the veggie savory crepes with the veggie soup. We both LOVED our meals. The soup especially was outstanding.   Owners were not the friendliest...but they made the food fresh to order and they were fast. Loved this place!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't have the crepes, just a soy latte, which was very tasty. The crepes smelt really delish though...will have to come back to check it out.  I like the outdoor patio; great place to read and have a coffee while the streets in Kensington Market were closed to traffic on Sunday. Festive"}
{"text":"Finally managed to successfully come here when it's open. First time I came after 7 PM and it was closed. Second time I came on a Monday and it was also closed. Turns out their opening hours had changed from previously stated yelp hours and their closed on both Mondays AND Tuesdays, and only open between 11 to 6 or 11 to 7 on other days.  There's a huge animation of a fireplace playing at the back of the restaurant, with a bunch of art along the walls. Kitchen is up front and you can see a number of different items such as pots of soup or baked goods. You can also watch them make your crepe if you would like.  Crepes here cost around $11 to $13 each, but they are relatively large crepes compared to some other crepe places downtown so perhaps that may justify the price.  We ordered three different crepes, and they took about 10 to 15 minutes to serve up.  1. I am Classic, which is a savoury crepe that comes with chicken, baby spinach, tomatoes, cheese, and sour cream. I liked this the most, mostly because I enjoy meaty crepes. It was nice and warm  2. I am Peaceful, which is another savoury crepe. Comes with similar ingredients as the classic, except instead of chicken it comes with basil pesto, with balsamic sauce drizzled on top. This one wasn't as interesting to me, and there wasn't much basil pesto flavour. I still prefer the meat one more.  3. I am Exquisite. This one's a sweet crepe with strawberry pieces, slices of banana, ice cream, and chocolate sauce drizzled on top. It tasted alright, and the taste of real fruit is always good to have.  We also had the \"Feeling Fruity\" smoothie, which was a blend of strawberries, banana, orange juice, and milk. It was ok.  They also charge 50 cents if you want to pay by card."}
{"text":"I like it! summer. patio. people watching. great crepes that are different from regular french ones.  they have a variety of teas and coffees. and a choice of sweet and savory krepesz=)  I loved mine with feta and spinach. and the price is only about $8"}
{"text":"I had a nice experience here! The interior is spacious but cozy, with a wall displaying pretty much the fireplace channel. Service was really great - we had a guy who was very friendly.  I ordered the I Am Classic (paprika chicken, and I chose feta cheese to go inside, added 50 cents to make it spicy, and added $1 for the crispy cheese coating). Loved all my choices. The crispy cheese coating gave it a nice crunch. As for the chicken, I was expecting pieces of chicken in the crepe but turns out it is ground chicken! Oh well, still tastes good =)  Finished off with a dessert crepe (shared it) with sweet ricotta, honey, bananas and strawberries. I liked the option of the sweet ricotta, because it is less sweet than nutella for example. The honey had a strong flavour, and I think next time I may ask to substitute it for a different sauce, or have it on the side instead. I would also prefer just strawberries inside rather than with bananas too. We added ice cream to our dessert crepe, on the side for $1, and it was a solid two scoops.   The drinks are mediocre though. My friend got the hot chocolate and he thought it was too diluted. I tried it and I agree. I could barely taste the chocolate flavour. I had the london fog which was ok but not memorable.  All in all, had a great experience here!"}
{"text":"Whenever we're in Kensington, it is a must that we come here - for Cherry Rose tea. The only other place we've ever been able to find this particular cherry rose loose leaf tea is at the Royal York's High Tea, which is not a frequent option!  This is Kensington, so the tiny little space is hardly something you can blame on this place in particular, but, it does feel very cramped, and the feeling is intensified by the hot creperie plates and coffee and tea brewing machines going full force.  Nothing special other than that particular tea, not bad, but also pricey for what you get and what other options you have in Kensington.  If you like live music, this is a plus in their favour, but again, you can't move to a quieter area."}
{"text":"Amaizing atmosphere, great food, great drink specials and great staff!! We were there on a Saturday night and after walking a lot we decided to take a beer brake, we went here because they had a couple of drinks specials and we ended up staying here for quite a while just talking to the staff, ordered some appetizers and hang out. Great stop at Kensington market!"}
{"text":"This is a stop my gf always brings her foreign visiting friends to. It's a crêpe place that isn't French. It's Hungarian. The menu reflects this in a good way but still caters to the traditionalist as well.   Because of this cultural mix and cuisine, it makes the experience unique. I'm not a huge fan of crêpes in the first place but it's good on occasion. I don't see them as a meal, I see them as a dessert or snack.  The crepes here do fill you up though, especially the savory type.  My gf raves over the Hungarian Stew crepe. It's hearty, flavourful and definitely different as far as toppings and fillings go for crepes. For around 8 bucks, it's a fair price.  To compliment the crepes, there are flavored teas which are good as well. I think I'd like it even more now that it's getting chilly outside.  Overall, Krepesz does a good job of bringing Hungarian flare to a French classic. Without being offensive or radical, they've managed to carry-out both culinary flavors we expect (or don't expect) through a crepe. It's a small casual cafe that does things right."}
{"text":"A friend and myself were on a \"Crepe Crusade\" this visit, all in all we visited 4 different places. This was the last one we hit. Small and quiet little spot in Kensington Market. Easy listening music playing in the background we ordered a simple hazelnut with a glass of milk and a cookie. Out of the the bunch, I would say this was our least favorite crepe. It was very greasy and had felt like it wasn't cooked enough. Very gummy. The flavor of the crepe was on the bland side so all we really tasted was the nutella. While we were here 3 other people came in and ordered coffees which seemed to be what the server enjoyed doing more so than the crepes. Not bad, just not a place I feel the need to go back to."}
{"text":"I actually bought a groupon to come here for the first time. We were exploring downtown Toronto and decided that we wanted crepes. It is located in Kensington Market, it took us about 10 minutes to find the location from the streetcar.  The service was extremely friendly. The patio was super busy so we sat inside. Overall, I love the atmosphere. It is a cute little location which is known for its crepes. I don't rememebr the exact crepe I tried but it had balsamic, mozzarella and spinach. I would say they were great, however a little overpriced. I would recommend this location to anyone who is in the area and wants to have some crepes as well as beer."}
{"text":"Amazingly friendly staff, great soy chai latte, and relaxing atmosphere and beer.  What more could I ask for   Also, I left for about 30 minutes after having my coffee and as I was walking back to the area to meet up with friends, but I had to really use the bathroom.  I asked and they accommodated.  I know it's a small thing, but appreciated.  Any who.,try the chai latte"}
{"text":"Saturday 8 pm and hardly any shop open for a quick meal fix.  Krepesz was open until 9 pm this night as I noticed couples and MacBook students making this place their comfy Cafe of choice.  With this sign, I walked in to notice \"Mom\" greeting me where I ordered and she said I can take a seat while I originally thought it was a Pay & Take type of joint like other Cafes in the immediate area.  Sitting on the Patio Wooden Furniture at the back, this is quite a comfortable setting mostly due to the choice of Wall Color I believe.  It was somewhat bright for my liking but those MacBook users, Magazine readers, Assignment students didn't mind it one bit as a Staff brought my meal to me.  Chicken Stew Crepe(Ground Chicken Breast, cooked in Hungarian Paprika Sauce with Sour-Cream, Shredded Cheese and Spinach $7.97)  Gummy it was for the Crepe but that didn't make it an unappealing experience for me by any means.  My comparison to this Gummy Crepe texture is of a Japanese Takoyaki which I'm a fan.  It looks like a new version Taco/Burrito with a slight difference you might notice from the photos.  Personally, the Chicken in Hungarian Sauce is satisfying and homey which reminds me of same qualities of Hungarian Goulash that would have made it just as satisfying on a cold Autumn night.  The seasoning here was actually on the light-handed side but that just made it feel more healthy for some reason.  The choice of Chicken Breast and Spinach helped that effort.  Satisfied walking into the cool autumn's night..."}
{"text":"Good service , good music, hipster like interior . Went there to pass some time and turned out to have a nice small menu .  They also have this espresso in ice cream drink , really unique but not what I would suggest for regular coffee drinkers ."}
{"text":"Great place to grab brunch and sit around people watching in the heart of Kensington market. Their gluten free buckwheat crapes are amazing. I've had both the savory and the sweet and both did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I've always passed this place whenever I was in Kensington Market but haven't stepped in until recently. It wasn't too busy inside but their patio area was full. I  was greeted immediately by the staff.   I can't remember which crepe I had ordered (it had spinach and tomato for sure), but it was pretty good. Nothing too special about it but pretty filling and tasty.   For dessert I had their Nutella muffin and oh. my. God. It was mind blowing. Anyone coming here definitely has to try it, and I promise you won't be disappointed.   My favorite part about this place is their washroom. It had the words \"hello beautiful\" written on the mirror which I think is adorable."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon deal with a value of $25 at Krepesz. It was my first time eating there. They have a patio, and the inside of the restaurant is decorated with tropical/sea theme, and it created a good and unique atmosphere.   I had the \"I am exquisite\" crepe with Fresh strawberries, banana, ice cream and chocolate drizzle for $11. Everything was good, except that I personally don't like fruits."}
{"text":"Located in Kensington Market, Krepesz is a really nice place for lunch or dessert. They have plenty of seating inside and some tables outside as well. I tried both a savory and sweet crepe and both were amazing! We had the \"I am Classic\" crepedilla, which I think is the same as a normal crepe except slightly smaller and cut into slices... But delicious!  I also had the \"I am Chocolicious\" with ice cream. You can't go wrong with nutella and bananas!  Great place to grab some food, especially when you want to step away from the Kensington Market crowds."}
{"text":"What is everyone raving about. Terrible.   Coffee was like warm milk. Crepes were shocking. Thin and tasteless. Do yourself a favor and save your money or walk across the street. It looked better but someone in our group wanted crepes. Cost $60 and was one of the worst meals we have had in TO."}
{"text":"I visited this place several times already. The crepes here are delicious especially the desert crepes.  The place is not very big but it can sit a fair amount of people. The past two times i went, they were sold out if the nutella muffins which if you are a chocolate fan, it will surely give you that fix.  The place always does specials on groupon and other deal sites which I've always taken advantage of when going here. I dont think, I'll go without it."}
{"text":"Although the food looked and smelled great this review is only for the patio.  It's not too crowded and the seats are just plain wooded chairs. Each table has a parasol which is a hit for hot and sunny weather.  Slightly more expensive for my taste, but I guess it's good for Kensington or any other patio for that matter. A SanPellegrino and Ice Coffee came up to 7$ with tip."}
{"text":"Great tasting savory and sweet crepes at a reasonable price. overall, it was a good experience for us and for the most part, decent customer service"}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Crepes were alright, not really hungarian at all.  I had the chicken stew crepe to try it out, and it was pretty gross.  If you want to try something they would eat in hungary try the walnut and apricot jam crepe, that's the best one. Ive also eaten their soup of the day, which was good.  Also, save your money and dont buy the palinka. They use a pretty garbage brand (I was hoping it would be an import from hungary) and they just dilute it with honey."}
{"text":"Great place for sweet and savoury crepes in Kensington Market. I'm glad we tried this place out, my friend had a magazine coupon.  The service was delightful! Friendly staff! They were easy going and helpful with menu suggestions.  It was about $12 per crepe. Made fresh to order. I had a Classic Crepedilla with chicken, spinach, tomato and mozzarella. The Crepedilla (like tortilla style) is smaller than their regular sized crepes- but still very filling. (see pics).  The atmosphere was relaxing and casual. They also have a nice patio.   Recommended spot, if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I inadvertently turned my head and notice this cafe the other day.  It's unsuspecting.  I suppose in the market with signs everywhere some places can get lost.  I've read more about the business and their story.  My whole lean towards walking is always the coffee so I had no intention of trying anything else. However, I can't say I noticed anything particularly unique about the place except that I found it quite modern for a Kensington cafe.  I liked that aspect though.  49th parallel coffee is their beans of choice here.  I have tried that coffee at 49th Parallel Vancouver.  I've even bought their beans and made it at home.  I really, really want to like this but I have to say it always falls behind,  Every time I have had a cup of any 49th parallel derivative it always goes down as OK.   That's how i feel about my drink.  I think the pastry would be better but the coffee is OK. You won't be disappointed but at the same time you won't drop dead and kiss the ground at the wonder of the cup o'joe you just had."}
{"text":"I was excited to check this place out after reading about it on Yelp and it sure lived up to the expectation.  While other Hungarian restaurants may serve you 5 different kinds of Schnitzel, Krepesz brings me something more true to what I used to eat as a kid,  Crepes or Palacsinta (in Hungarian).  They have about a dozen different kinds both sweet and savoury as well serve coffees and beer.  We ordered one with ricotta, strawberries and banana, and the other was with chicken and spinach.  I didn't think I would like the chicken one but it was actually ridiculously good!  The fruit one was very yummy as well.  I was impressed with the portions, well sized and filled, not too much but just right.  I am definitely looking forward to my next visit to Kensington Market area!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give half a star, for this establishment robed me and my friends blind.   Service: The guys were nice, however it took over 10 minutes to make our beverages with no customers ahead of us.    Beverages: We ordered two hot chocolates ($4.50 each) and a green tea ($3.40). The hot chocolate was literally hot water with just enough cocoa powder to change the colour of the water. The green tea came in the smallest cup I've ever seen in a coffee shop, and cost more than an xtra large tea at most places.   Overall my group left very unhappy with our drinks, and none of us will be returning here."}
{"text":"This place is in the heart of Kensington where there are a ton of options to choose from. This place doesn't stand out in its food or decor but I thought I'd give it a try anyways.   On a Sunday afternoon, it was pretty busy but no problem getting a seat. The decor is mediocre with a projector playing at the back (and shining in patrons faces) and patio furniture which is never that comfortable.   My wife and I got two savoury crepes, the classic and I am awake. Neither stood out as anything enjoyable or appetizing. Perhaps you come here for the gluten free crepes?  The prices are pretty high for what you get ($12) especially with all the other amazing food you can get in Kensington. Grab a latte at Fika, a croissant at Blackbird, a beef patty at the Golden Patty, and you're still saving money for tons more flavour."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in the hustling Kensington Market and is a really pleasant place to have lunch in between all the shopping you'll undoubtedly be doing.  We had a Group for 50% off crepes and tried a savory crepe - a crepedilla, and a dessert crepe. Both crepes were good! The savory crepedilla was a mix between a quesadilla and a crepe with loads of cheese. Very delicious!  The dessert crepe we had was a nutella and strawberry crepe with a scoop of ice cream on the side. Very tasty!  I wouldn't necessarily recommend going out of the way to try these crepes, but if you're in the area, you'll be in for a very tasty lunch!"}
{"text":"We bought a Groupon and drove over 60 km just to try the place out. When we arrived, we were informed they were closing due to a private function. There was absolutely zero indication on their website or on their door. And nothing from the employees other than \"sorry\"  Of course, we're not going to bother with this place again."}
{"text":"- what I tried:   + I am strong crepedillas (4/5): the crepe was very crispy and tasty, went very well with their mexican hot sauce   + I am classic (5/5): the meat was so flavourful, love love love this one  - Portion is good for a light brunch - Service was fast and friendly - A bit pricy but I got groupon so it wasnt too bad  - Their menu option is very limited"}
{"text":"Funky cool atmosphere. Food hit the spot and so did the sangria! Great lunch stop."}
{"text":"We purchased a Groupon for this visit and coincidentally visited on a Paint Nite evening.  Purchased:  I am Classic - Rich paprika chicken, baby spinach, fresh tomatoes, sour cream, cheese  I am Exquisite - Fresh strawberries, banana, ice cream, chocolate drizzle  Taste: The crepes were undoubtedly among some of the best we've tried in the city. The savory flavors were strong, fruits were fresh and the texture of the crepe were thin and crunchy but not losing the chewiness. Servings were at an enjoyable size.   The Classic crepe boasted a balance of savoriness and freshness, while the sweet crepe was enveloped by tangy fruits and delectable ice cream. We added $1 for extra cheese on the outside of the savory crepe, making it extra crunchy - definitely recommend!  We were impressed by the service of the restaurant and the wide selection of drinks (alcoholic selections too) available - service was personable and speedy. Cost was reasonable as well! Overall a thumbs up for this creperie!"}
{"text":"My pal and I dropped in to warm up because it was so cold outside. The decor inside is really cute and spacious; there are heaps of tables.   Didn't get to try their crepes (next time!), but had an Americano Misto with a Chimney Cake (a Hungarian treat). I really like this place - it's a chill out place that serves crepes, coffee, and Canadian beers."}
{"text":"Love the location in Kensington market. Food was okay, not bad. Definitely had a nice time sitting on the patio and enjoying lunch. I'd come back if my friends wanted to go, but I'd probably try other places first in the area now that I've had it once."}
{"text":"Great place, AWESOME KREPESZ.. I recommend the \"I am Classic tito style krepe\" forgot to take pictures  But its a really nice and chill place to get yummy krepesz. Staff is super friendly, but prices are a little extreme for drinks."}
{"text":"Popped in here for a quick pick me up. They KILL a Latte!   Sooo yummy and not too strong.   Just enough to give you that kick and who can't resist the foam art :)   Don't tell the headoffices of Starbucks, but I would choose these guys over them :D   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place while walking through Kensington Market. Their savory crepes were delicious and if we weren't heading to get some pie after (at Wanda's), I would have ordered their Nutella Walnut crepe.   They are definitely going to get a return visit!"}
{"text":"Wandering through Kensington, just happened to find this place along Augusta and went in for a coffee. Chairs and tables were wooden garden furniture...uncomfortable and screamed \"we don't want you here particularly long\". A drop ceiling with clear water spots (including around pot lights) told of fire hazard/something's gonna give. Once we sat down and ordered, the chill atmosphere started to sink in. Coffees were simply amazing (they have no decaf, but do have soy milk, in case you were wondering). We also made the joyous decision to order a sweet crepe. Maybe a bit steep at the same $8 as the savoury crepes that appeared to come loaded with chicken and veggies, but simply awesome. Crepe itself was nicely cooked and just springy enough- perfect. Nutella and walnut/cream with rum was ground walnuts and whipped cream with a drizzle of rum, over the nutella filled crepe- no complaints.  Although the final tag was as much as lunch in the area, nice for a break and worth it. Wi-Fi and booze available. Patio looks like it has the potential to be an awesome spot to be during the better weather."}
{"text":"This place was such a great find! It was the best crepe by far that I've ever had. All the ingredients were fresh and I watched them make all the food fresh to order. The atmosphere in this quaint little cafe is warm and inviting. The service was great as was the coffee and beer selection. I will definitely be coming back to try their famous sangria and one of the beautiful dessert crepes next time. Definitely 5 star!"}
{"text":"An amazing restaurant and patio in Kensington Market offering delicious crepes. Came here with my friend, we had a Groupon $15/25 which got us two amazing crepes. We didn't have the dessert crepes but they looked delicious. For lunch, I recommend getting the 'I am Classic' crepe comes with paprika chicken, baby spinach, tomatoes, sour cream and your choice of mozzarella, cheddar or feta cheese. I also recommend adding a bit of basil pesto, goes well with the chicken. I highly recommend adding the Tito option which makes the outside shell of the crepe crispy with added cheese! No sides with this meal, but makes room for a crepe dessert if your up for it.  This place is dog friendly and they even let you bring your wee-little one on the patio, and they supply you with a water dog bowl, how amazing is that! Definitely would come back here willing to try some dessert. Great place for a date too! 5/5 $$"}
{"text":"I went there very very late and people were nice and friendly, but honestly the giant crepe I had didn't taste very much."}
{"text":"curiosity got the best of me and I found my self figuring out first hand what the hell a chicken stew crepe could be. What the hell is it? Delcious! This full meal-sized item had fresh spinach and a cheesyness I could not resist.  Though a full 9 dollars with tax the item is larger and made quickly. Though with any reheating ability you need two people to eat it. I got mine to go and w.ant to go avain"}
{"text":"I had my sights set on getting a crepe while in Toronto for a few hours, and was mildly  disappointed with Krepesz. Don't get me wrong, the Funky Crepe was amazing, with peanut butter and banana and honey! But, $12 for a single crepe??? Definitely not worth it. This place was way too pricey for my liking. If you like crepes that cost like they are made out of gold, than maybe this place is for you."}
{"text":"I am easy... Krepesz Cafe won me over easily...   - Empty on a Sunday lunch time at Kensington Market area - rainy outside  - free WIFI just ask for password  - Crepes!! Yes Freshly made Crepes!  - Combo Deal?!!! Crepes and Cappuccino for $9.99  - Nutella!! (My default fillings for a sweet crepe!)   I just hang around here for awhile until the rain stop.. enjoying my crepe which was deliciously.. a little more doughy but great as a brunch..   I will be back for their Chicken Stew Crepe,,,, since of course it is a Combo Special deal!"}
{"text":"Not bad spot for crêpes in Kensington Market. It's worth pointing out right off the bat that these aren't the French crêpes you're probably used to. They are a bit thicker and taste like they have been cooked a little longer than typical crêpes, but they're still pretty decent and you get a good portion.  They serve both sweet and savoury Hungarian crêpes (palacsinta) here. They are pretty specifically priced at $7.97, and they have a combo deal where you can get soup and crêpe or coffee and crêpe for ten bones. Not too shabby.  They serve espresso here also (49th Parallel) and have free Wi-Fi. Given that ALL the furniture is patio furniture, I'm not likely to spend too much time here to work, but I'll definitely stop by if I'm feeling in a crêpe-y mood.  Obligatory Title Pun: Don't shed this PALACSINTA.  Menu Readability: Loosely wrapped in plastic. What up with that? Just laminate that beyotch.  Need to mention: They are licenced and have Mill Street and Flying Monkey on draught.  What this place teaches me about myself: I'm HUNGAR-ing for a better title pun."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing atmosphere! Finace and I got savoury crepes, I don't remember the names -- I think one of them was \"I am Peace\" and the other \"I am Calm\" .. I never expected a crepe to taste so good! Liked my fiances crepe more though, tasted like a light lasagna! Definitely will return soon"}
{"text":"A very nice and cozy place in Kengsinton market.  Food: 3/5, typical crepe Service: 5/5, very friendly and attentive staff  I bought a coupon for 2 people and got 1/2 off. I had the savory classical and my friend had the sweet chocolate crepe. I really like mine, it is like a meat pie. My friend's crepe is a bit too sweet but goes with coffee. I like the interior decor of this place and it is small but cozy place in Kengsinton market."}
{"text":"I'm honestly only writing this review based on one visit and one latte but it was the best damn latte I have ever had in my life.... and I have drunk a lot of lattes. I can't describe how flavourful and utterly delicious it was but that's really the best way I can describe what I experienced. It was honestly an orgasm in my mouth. Next time I'm in Toronto, you can bet money I'll make a trip there again."}
