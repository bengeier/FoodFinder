{"text":"I had a French dip which was a phenomenal! Probably the best one I had at a long time. I like this place also because its conveniently close to where I go shooting. If you in the area I would try this place it's good. It's seems very welcoming and family owned which is pretty cool. I definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Wonderful Tuna salad sandwich, great coleslaw, pleasant staff, fast service in a clean welcoming restaurant!"}
{"text":"Probably the best sandwich shop I've ever been too. Prices are very reasonable. Every single sandwich I have ordered has flavorful meats and fresh vegetables."}
{"text":"Great find,  very good food and extra kind staff.  Enjoyed finding this place on yelp after we were stuck behind a big Subway line nearby.  Great selection of hot and cold sandwiches, soups and specials.  It didn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"hAd the urge for a good sandwich today but was tired of all the franchise restaurants in Vegas. Found Woods on Yelp and was totally satisfied.  my picky husband had the French dip which he totally enjoyed and I had the chicken salad which was delicious. Owner was friendly and very helpful and answered all our questions.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is a nice little lunch spot if you're looking for something quick. I really like that they use Boar's Head meat."}
{"text":"I really like the turkey sandwiches, and so does my 5 year old, which is the main reason why I drive 30 mins to this place. I have made several orders here and 90% of the time, my simple sandwiches were made wrong. Last time I received 50% off, which I appreciated. But the order from that discount was made with a salad lettuce mix and not the  regular  finely chopped romaine. I never heard back from them after my Facebook  review..but I did notice they responded to other reviews on there. I would really like to return to this place.. Hope to hear from you guys soon."}
{"text":"This place was packed! And for a good reason. Very friendly sevice and fresh tasty sandwhiches. It was a bit pricey, but worth it because of the big portions and freshness. Will definitely be back. Worth a try."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and super friendly staff!  The location is conveniently close to the Valley Auto Mall.  If you're in the area and hungry it's definitely a good place to stop!"}
{"text":"First time visiting! Ordered the Italian sandwich and also the roast beef toasted with Cole slaw on top. Both sandwiches were excellent! Every ingredient fresh and made to order. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back!! Many other items to try!!"}
{"text":"A good friend of mine that lives in Vegas recommended Woods Family Sandwiches. Wow! Everything is fresh and delicious! The staff are all very friendly and efficient. I plan on making it a regular stop when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Visited Las Vegas from LA and found this spot through Yelp. All of the reviews so far have been honest. This place is very welcoming and a good spot to eat. The cashier is very kind and knows nearly everyone who walks in the store by their name. Sandwiches are amazing. Had the turkey sandwich and it was really good. Parents got pastrami and tuna and they were completely satisfied. Potato salad and coleslaw were both amazing too. Definitely lives up to the ratings."}
{"text":"Ordered the Italian sandwich,  it was excellent. Staff was friendly and service was quick. Also ordered a french dip sandwich for my wife. She said it was the best french dip.sandwich she had ever had. Overall excellent.  I will be back"}
{"text":"Just flew into town and we are staying in Henderson. We were craving sandwiches and this place was sooo good! We even came back a couple times during our stay. The bread was fresh and so were all the other toppings! The people were so friendly. Loved our experience each time!"}
{"text":"I stopped in on a whim and I am so glad that I did.  I went to the Flamingo restaurant, and it was so fresh and good.  The staff. Was friendly and the sandwich I had was delicious.  The special is only 7.99 for sandwich, chips, and drink. I will definitely be back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I'm honored to be the first reviewer for this location. My review is on the food, as I ordered through a delivery service.  I ordered the oven gold turkey sub (hoagie/hero), with a whole pickle and potato salad, and I have to say, the sub was fresh and tasty. The seasoning they use is delicious. And, they use Boars Head cold cuts, which in my humble opinion, are the best. The potato salad is fantastic, it reminds me of what I used to get when I lived in New York, very flavorful. And being able to get a whole dill pickle is just a bonus.  There are many places where you can get a sub/hoagie/hero, but Woods Family Sandwiches is a legitimate \"NY style\" sub shop on the Eastside!  Give them a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place! The sandwiches are amazing, plus the Service is great and the staff is very friendly!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting my dad in Henderson recently and had the pleasure of eating lunch here....and we were not disappointed.   My husband had the french dip and his comment was \"the best French dip I have ever had\".  I had the black forest ham.  It was packed with ham and veggies and was so good (loved the rolls so fresh and delicious!!) My dad wanted a salad and he was served a huge salad and I believe it was under $5 - he couldn't even finish it because it was so big. The staff was so friendly and helpful  - they obviously get a lot of return business because the staff knew a lot of their customers by name.....always a good sign when people keep returning! We definitely will  come here anytime we are in the Henderson area and will try some of the other items. Wish they had one located in California!"}
{"text":"Great little sandwich shop. The beef dip and the pastrami are so tender and tasty!  Will definitely add this place to our list of regulars!"}
{"text":"Woods Family Sandwiches makes good comfort food to comfort your soul on those long work days.  I got their Blazing Buffalo Crunchy cold sandwich, and I didn't read the small print well enough. I felt my heart skip a few beats when I took my first bite and tasted all of the fried onion that I forgot was going to be in the sandwich. I should've gotten my eyes checked because it said right on the menu that it includes fried onions. Woods Family puts a tremendous amount of comfort in their sandwiches because I would've passed out if I ate this sandwich on my sofa.  The sandwich was very delicious, and the meat was mildly spicy but tolerable, even with my sensitive taste buds. The bread was fresh and complemented the chicken well, although the bread might've been a bit thick, blunting the taste of the contents of the sandwich. I wasn't ready for such an excellent sandwich, but I'll have to come here again on one of my days off when I'm ready to go hard on lounging.  The service is good and the place is clean. Overall I had a positive experience at Woods Family Sandwiches.  I recommend anyone trying to find good sandwiches to consider trying out Woods Family Sandwiches."}
{"text":"This was one of the first sandwich shops I tried when I moved to Henderson. Their Ovengold turkey sandwich is hands down one of the best I have ever had. I love the fact that I get to have cheddar cheese with my turkey, instead of the ubiquitous Swiss or provolone cheese.  Today I went out on a limb and tried the turkey chili, which was delicious. What I almost liked more, however, was the bag of small pieces of soft French bread that they had thoughtfully tossed in there to go with my chili. Absolutely wonderful combination!    I plan to become a Woods Family regular."}
{"text":"When I got there was quickly greeted and confirmed I was there for a pick up. Got the 9\" classic Italian with a house made potato salad, salt & vinegar chips, kosher pickle and I said what the hell I'll try the Italian ice thingy they have for dessert. All together was $19 and some change which wasn't too bad because I shared it with my girl.  Such a simple yet well put together sandwich. I love sandwiches and this one seems to be packed with flavor. I guess it's because they only use Boars Head high quality meats & cheese, but either way this place has become a favorite of mine."}
{"text":"Best sandwich I have eaten in a long time. The bread was fresh, so we're the vegetables nice and crisp. I will be back to try the other sandwiches."}
{"text":"I order classic Italian for delivery! The person taking the order was extremely pleasant! My order was delivered on time! The sandwich is YUMMMMM! Perfect!"}
{"text":"This is one of the better sandwich shops I've been to! It's family owned, which is awesome! I always get the italian when I'm there and my boyfriend gets the joey. It's always clean and the employees are always friendly and very helpful!"}
{"text":"This place is okay. The food is good, and nothing spectacular. With that being said, their prices are pretty high for what they are serving. I'm kinda upset because they use to offer a space on their delivery receipts to include a tip for the delivery person, and I noticed that that was recently removed as an option. When I called today and ask if I could include a tip, I was given a very stern \"No.\" I feel pretty awful for the poor delivery person and I don't think I will be ordering delivery from them again. I just don't think that's fair."}
{"text":"Never again.  Have patronized this restaurant a few times before because it is close by and food isn't too bad.  We have previously overlooked the somewhat abrasive and short demeanor of the manager because the young kid making the sandwiches has always been pleasant.  However, today we arrived seventeen minutes before the 5 o'clock closing time.  To be polite and acknowledge that we knew they were closing in just under twenty minutes, I mentioned we wouldn't be long because we were cognizant of the time.  The manager replies, \"Yeah, we're pretty much closed up for the day\".  Really?!?  We turned around and left and she had no problem allowing that to happen.  So is it about your convenience or is it about being in the customer service industry? I'm pretty sure it's the latter.   If you're going to run a business I don't care if someone walks in five minutes before you're ready to close.  You accommodate them and you do it with a smile.  This was ridiculous, and needless  to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"Great sandwich! I was in town for work and needed something that was close by and I found this place. I had the turkey pesto hot sandwich and thought it was one of the best I have had. They were very friendly. Definitely try it out. Kind of an odd location but it was easy to find."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love the Italian sandwich from this shop. It always tastes so fresh, we want to try other sandwiches on the menu but the Italian is always so satisfying. He honestly tells everyone about it, says it the best Italian sandwich he's had. We lived right in front of the shop on Flamingo now we've moved to Henderson and we were happy to know we have one down the block."}
{"text":"Short and sweet. Great service. Great food. This spot is the creme de la creme of sandwich shops and I have to stop every time I'm on the east side."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches! My favorite is the Italian sub! I wish they had a location in NW."}
{"text":"I get their meatball sub. Great service and cozy atmosphere. They treat you like family. They have fresh baked cookies also that are yummy."}
{"text":"I hope more people find out this place is here because it's tucked away with other businesses. When I saw the sign after walking in that they had Boar's Head meats and cheeses I had a good feeling. There was a guy and girl working and they were both friendly. I ordered a hot pastrami sandwich and I am from Cali so it's generally the standard to just have meat, cheese, mustard and pickles on a pastrami sandwich but here they add a bit extra and I felt adventurous so I tried it \"their\" way. That meant of course the pastrami but it also meant 3 pepper cheese, pickles, peperoncinis, red onions and seasoning. I can't even believe all that worked as well as it did together but damn it really did. I enjoyed every bite of the sandwich and the size of it for just $7.99 and being quality meat and cheese is nice. The bread they have is sub rolls and it was very good too. My wife had a Italian sandwich and we both ended up tasting each others. We liked them both so much that we split the other halves of our sammies so we could enjoy both. They also sell Boar's Head mayo, oil, mustard, etc. After I ate I was full and satisfied. The only downside is that this location isn't on the side of town I live and that right now they are only open for 5 hours (10:30 am til 3:30 pm) a day mon - fri. I do work in the field so when I am over here I will stop by for lunch but i do hope at some point they open up on weekends."}
{"text":"Look no further if you want to bite into a rich, creamy but fluffy egg salad sandwich on fresh bread. You'll find it here at Woods Family Sandwiches! No yolk!  Big plus, made in-house, from scratch, family recipe.  I usually order via UberEats and turnaround from time I place order to delivery is 27 minutes tops! (during off peak lunch crunch).  My visits in the shop have been pretty pleasant, most of the time, I'm picking up a sandwich on my way back home. Dining in, there are a few tables, dining area is clean.  Staff I've dealt with have always been friendly and my orders were out quick... well except the last visit, when I picked up lunch, had to wait a few minutes longer for Mr B's meatball sandwich to bake in the oven. The employee kept me updated and was apologetic. No worries.  That's all I usually order so I can't tell you how the other sandwiches are. But husband is a fan of their meatball sandwich.  Prices are slightly higher. But you're getting quality stuff here!  Oh, also my favorite and hard to find is the kettle chips with horseradish! So grab a bag or two when you're here.  Finding this place is another story. It is facing American Pacific, in the building structure, right side (coming off from Gibson) . The place blends in, so look for the sandwich board as you pass Cassia Wy. Your other visual cue will be Touro U which is on the OPPOSITE corner."}
{"text":"This place is so yummy!!! I ordered an egg sandwich  and I couldn't be happier."}
{"text":"Really yummy sandwiches! I love that they are close to Touro so we can just walk over on our lunch break. They're fast and friendly. They also give a student discount. I just wish they were open later/on Saturdays so I could go with my husband as he has yet to try them! I've only gotten the turkey, but I've heard the French dip is a must try. I'll get that next time."}
{"text":"Yum! Turkey sandwich was delicious! Loved the pickle, too. Potato salad was just average in my opinion. A little pricey overall, but the sandwich was worth it. The turkey was cut just perfectly and tasted awesome! We first tried to visit on Saturday at 2:30pm... Yelp had their hours listed as being open until 5pm on Saturdays... the door at the restaurant said they were open until 3pm, but it was all locked up at 2:30pm when we got there. Not sure why, but just wanted to note that in case it helps others. We ended up going back on Monday and like I said the sandwich was great so I'm glad we did. Will definitely be back when we're back in town."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this sandwich shop. I ordered the italian sub to go. This was the best italian sub I ever had. Everything was perfect. Great meats, fresh veggies the savory dressing added up to a delicious meal. Grand slam! In the words of the great General Douglas MacArthur ' I shall return!!\""}
{"text":"Picked up an excellent sub. I got 2 meals out of the small one. The potato salad tasted like it was from a container, but I will be back for more sandwiches. They use good meats and cheeses, which makes a big difference. I've tried the chains and this one beats them all. Glad to know it's there, waiting for my next trip to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are fantastic. I've had the turkey, turkey pesto melt, and the French dip, and all were very tasty (especially the French dip; wonderful meat and perfect bread). I will most definitely be heading back to try the classic Italian. Do yourself a favor and pick up some of the potato salad too; soooo good. I always call in my orders for pickup and the service is very quick. Now go eat some lunch!"}
{"text":"Pretty good mom and pop sandwich spot hade the pastrami sandwich every thing was fresh on there"}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop. Come here from a recommendation. I had the lunch special which was great. If I am ever in the area again I will be coming back. They had great service the women at the counter was a big help. The other staff was very friendly and they have fun while they work."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in the valley!  Friendly staff and great prices. Plus they have made sandwich trays for 2 parties for me.  Great place!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches. Came here fornthe firat time today. Great location. In the Planet Fitness parking lot. Back of the restraunt faces Flamingo. The meat is excellent! I had the hot pastrami with everything on it. It's the best pastrami I've ever had. The xheese has a little bit of a spice but not too much. The meat it top quality. I could only eat half of the 9\". The left over is dinner I guess lol typically not a fan of hot sandwiches but this one was bomb. The bread after toasting was crunchy on the outside and still soft on the inside. Bought a 9\" turkey for my kids and they split it. My 4 year old said it was the best sandwich he has ever had, but then again he's only 4 hahaha. Got a 9\" Italian for my husband, no tomato no onion. He would have preferred to have more of the oil vinegar stuff on it but other wise he liked it. He also didn't think the jalapeño chips were spicy at all but my mouth was burning lol we will be coming back for my FIL to try the French dip."}
{"text":"I love little mom and pop shops and that's really hard to find in Vegas. Stumbled over this place while getting my truck serviced at the dealership, needed a place to eat luckily this place was in walking distance. You can tell it's family run, which is nice, the service was friendly and the food was very good. Had the French dip and potato salad and both were delicious. I'm not on this side of town very often but next time I'm here for my vehicle service I'll definitely swing back by."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sandwich places in henderson. Used to come here frequently when I worked at a neighboring business. The owner is amazing. She is welcoming and personable."}
{"text":"I had the Italian sub. It was a solid 3.5. Nice people and great service. Sandwich was good, but have had plenty others that I rate higher. I think this place thrives on local business employees for convenience since next to automall."}
{"text":"People placed an order from work, so I joined in.  I was really hoping for a chicken parm, but alas, none to be found.  I settled in for a meatball, which did not disappoint.  Sure, it was pricy compared to a place like subway, but it was also 10x better than what subway calls meatballs.  Looking forward to trying some other items and hoping for a chicken parm in the future."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times for lunch and haven't had anything I didn't like. Much better and fresher than most of the larger brands. My personal favorite is the hot pastrami sandwich. Simply great!"}
{"text":"Locally owned, it is the \"mom & pop\" place which is VERY rare here in Vegas. You really feel at home in there. One of the employees makes bags and crafts and sells them, they have a table for local businesses to leave their card or flyer. They have a baby table with a few toys to keep your toddler entertained while you wait for your food. I love this place. The only opportunity they have is how much meat they put on the pastrami for the price they charge for it. They use boar's head meats so I am looking forward to trying the Italian next time."}
{"text":"Woods Family Sandwiches has done so well for themselves in Henderson that they've now opened a new location on the East side! Specializing in Boar's Head meats, cheeses, and spreads, the sandwiches come on fresh French rolls in 6 and 9-inch lengths or your choice of a wrap. Salads, soups, and sides round out the menu.  Bread is nicely soft, protein is generously portioned and high quality per the brand's reputation, and the combination of flavors on the Blazing Buffalo Crunchy Sub (buffalo turkey, crispy fried onions, lettuce, and bleu cheese spread) worked well together. Definitely spring for the larger size, as a buck more gets you 50% more sandwich ($6.99 vs $7.99).   Breakfast, combos and daily specials are available. There is no shortage of sandwich options in this area, but the value and service (family-owned and friendly) make this spot stand out."}
{"text":"Super good sandwiches! We love this place."}
{"text":"I am a fan of supporting local businesses, especially restaurants so when I heard there was a family run sandwich spot near me, I had to try it.  It's situated away in a more industrialized area which I like because it doesn't get lost being around a bunch of other restaurants.  I had a roast beef sandwich and potato salad and both were pretty good.  I am a big eater and I thought the size would be a problem, as a 9\" sandwich is their biggest but as a combo, it definitely was enough food.  The bread was soft and the meat was flavorful.  When I first tried the sandwich, and the potato salad, I wasn't  really expecting what I tasted.  It was good but different from any that I have had before even though it was comprised of the same items.  The flavor actually seemed to taste more homemade, which actually caught me off-guard at first but really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"The service was great!  The pastrami was delicious!   Can't wait to try the others!  This could end up being my favorite place for sandwiches!  Definitely agree with the other reviews!"}
{"text":"OMG. Yum.  We ordered this today for delivery and I just had to write a review because I was so impressed!  We ordered:  French Dip Grilled Cheese x2 Turkey Pesto + chips, drink combo  I was really concerned that the grilled cheese sandwiches would arrive hot, but the kiddos insisted so I took a chance.  To my pleasant surprise, all of our food arrived piping hot!  The grilled cheese was yummy (cheddar cheese and high quality at that).  I had the turkey pesto and I would order it again and again given the chance!  My only regret was not ordering a pickle with it because that would've been so delicious with it!  My sister in law enjoyed her french dip as well.  Overall, very happy with the food and I can't wait to order from them again!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches ever. Great food and friendly staff. Ordered the pastrami sandwich, egg salad sandwich and special of the day... Arlene's hot and spicy Italian. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh ingredients and convenient. We ordered the Classic Italian sub and egg salad on white bread.  The sub had plenty of meat and fresh veggies and the vinaigrette was tasty.   The egg salad recipe tastes very close to my homemade one. The only thing that was lacking was that the white bread was a bit stale, hence the 4 star rating.  We will be back to try their soups and other sandwiches."}
{"text":"Had the best pastrami sandwich here. very simple food but simple food is the hardest to make good like what they did. I can tell alot of care has been put into my food."}
{"text":"Great food and great people. Couldn't ask for anything better. Party of 6. I ordered the hot pastrami and they made it list like I like it. We all loved our food. Bread was fresh. Coffee was fresh. Area was clean and everyone was friendly. Keep up the great work. I Yelp for finds like this. Hidden gems that do business right!!"}
{"text":"i ordered a turkey & cheese w/ LTO mayo & vinegar ... i got a turkey wrap with lettuce, pickles (yuuuuk!), no cheese, no vinegar, soaking in oil.  And i got it to-go so i had no idea until i got all the way home.  upside - wrap was fresh and they turkey meat was great.  But why did i have to fill out a paper when they didnt bother to read it?  Not so sure a paper ordering system is they way to go :/  In reply: yes it was the Henderson location. Thank you for the response"}
{"text":"After trying several different sandwiches from here, I have updated my review. They have all been really tasty and fresh. The owner's are real nice and always take care of us.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Love this little family restaurant. Arlene and the team are always quick and courteous and the food is always great"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and always get the Italian grinder.  It is delicious!  I happened to see the guy making it the last time I was there and it was like watching an artist.  He took such care making me one of the best Italians I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich in town. Fresh ingredients. Meat is super good quality. They deliver which is a plus. Hidden away on American Pacific but well worth the visit."}
{"text":"After a workout was starving ...there weren't many quick options we saw across the street a sign for salads and subs ....we went in there are only 2 workers and about 6 people in the tiny restaurant. We waited a while for a cashier to attend us . Ordered the turkey pesto sandwich (only comes in white bread if you order the 9\") ordered that to split,  a salad and a tomato Bisque soup to add warmth on this rainy day . The meal came to $21 ...the sandwich was really good there was a lot of turkey meat in it and pesto sauce . The Tomato Bisque was really watery I tossed it . The place itself was small and there were product boxes on the hallway . Next time I would just order to go and skip the soups ."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are amazing and the customer service as well. Raymond and Steve were super friendly and recommended the thanksgiving sandwich for the next time I come in!"}
{"text":"Food was good however I was a little disappointed at all the extra \"fees\" on the receipt. .35 cc fee .50 for horseradish .75 for au jus ( that she offered). I would recommend letting people know of all the extra charges BEFORE hand."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches here. Delivery is insanely fast, they use great meats and breads and even their potato salad is amazing. Their menu is extremely diverse and makes it really easy for everyone to find something they like.  Can't say enough good things about this place. I hope they stay around.  If I had one tip to give the management, I would redo the menus to include photos of your most popular sandwiches. I was very surprised at how the sandwich was presented (in a good way) when I received it. I was turned off by the  prices at first but once I got the sandwich I understood why they were priced that way. I recommend the pastrami sandwich with the potato salad."}
{"text":"So we kind of found this place by accident around the corner from our delivery, and they have East Coast food! Real Italian subs, wraps, salads, etc... They also had Italian Ices and they SUCKED! (Luigi's in the Walmart frozen section tastes better!), but my hubby loved the sandwich! I ordered an Everything bagel, and honestly, it was \"just ok\", but wasn't even close to a bagel from back home in NY. Kind of tasted like a frozen bagel, but whatever I guess. We will still come back and try them again!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best sandwich shops I have eaten in and the customer service is great. Everyone is very friendly."}
{"text":"Well, I usually have nothing but great things to say about this place but today I am a bit upset with the fact that we are an inconvenience to the employee that delivered my food. This lady forgot the chips for my co-worker I call immediately and advise another young lady and she stated the employee will bring them right over as soon as she gets back. I receive a call about 10-15 mins later from the woman that delivered my food. She states that she is going to refund the combo. I had to ask so we aren't getting the chips? she said it was too much of a hassle they are too busy to come back and that she wasn't even suppose to be there today or deliver my food. Okay? So this is my problem how? I am just so disappointed in this place now. I doubt we will be going here again. Sucks because their food is really good but the service I got was unexpected and a bit rude.   1 HOUR LATER...   I just got off the phone with their amazing owner. She apologized. I have always loved their food and service. I guess today was a hiccup. It was busy and I understand that just was unexpected from that whole process. I love their food to much too say goodbye to it."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was AMAZING! The people were very friendly and the service was excellent! We will definitely be returning. My fiance had the buffalo chicken sub with chips and I had the hot pastrami with their homemade potato salad (DELICIOUS!) and a kosher pickle."}
{"text":"I often use Woods Family Deli when I am having lunches catered.  The quality of their product is topshelf!  They really work with me for what I need and when I need it.  Never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place. I had the pastrami sandwich and it was really good. The bread was super soft, there was a good amount of meat on the sandwich, and a good amount of mustard to make the sandwich great.  I also had the coleslaw which I thought was not bad at all, and I don't even like coleslaw. I'll be back to try something else."}
{"text":"Tried italian sub with potato salad. Sub tasted generic.  All meats fresh and tasty,  but sandwich  contents slim.  I did not like the potato salad at all.  It was full of mustard."}
{"text":"I am telling you this place rocks. I drive across town to get my sandwich fix. Staff is great and the owner really cares..I am a weekly customer."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just came here for lunch, and were quite satisfied. I got the cold turkey sandwich, and he got the hot pastrami - both were tasty. For our sides, I enjoyed the whole pickle (quartered), and my boyfriend was pleasantly surprised by the cole slaw. All of the ingredients were very fresh, and the service was quick and very friendly. Seating is a bit limited, but when we went, around 12:45, it wasn't crowded, so there was no issue. Though I would've liked more bread options (and something for dessert), we will definitely be back. Plus, they gave us a loyalty card (buy 9 9\" subs, get the 10th free), even though we just got 6\" subs (which was plenty of food)! The only downside is that it is a bit on the pricy side, but we were happy to support a new business."}
{"text":"A good, solid sandwich in my book.  I got the cold turkey and it didn't disappoint - for the most part, anyway.  The bread was soft and fresh, the turkey was tasty and the fixins were all on point.  The only thing I had an issue with was the pepperhouse gourmaise.  There were large pieces of peppercorn in it and it completely overpowered all the other tasty aspects of the sandwich.  If you're a pepper person, this will float your boat but I'll stick to plain old mayo going forward.  I got a 9\" and it's big.  I could really only finish half of it. The bread was delicious-soft and it taster like it was just baked. The veggies were super fresh and there was a really good amount of meat and cheese on the sandwich.  The staff were friendly and worked efficiently to enough so that I was in and out in about 5 minutes, despite the fact that it was fairly busy.  I'm excited to try some of the other sandwich options at Woods Family. I love that they're a locally owned business. Shop small, people!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like a big meaty treat in their mouth? I'm talking sandwiches bruh!  This place is way off the beaten path unless you work at the Valley Automall. It's hidden down a side road, right off Gibson and the 215. Once you do find this place you'll be happy. Decent sized sandwiches and a super friendly staff.   The menu here is like a deli template that every shop uses. Soups, sammies, salads, and don't forget the cola. I was starting to get hangry when I rolled up, so I went big, and ordered the twelve-inch pastrami, heavy on the meats. I opted out of the combo and just ordered chips. I would have loved a beer with my meal, but they only offer soda. Sorry Woods family, never touch the stuff, it'll kill ya!  I decided to eat at home, because this place simply isn't inviting. It doesn't feel like a place I would like to hangout at and enjoy my food. Picture a dentist office that serves sandwiches - super bright and sterile. Plus the place has weird wooden picket fences the circle the inside of the deli, for some reason they creeped me out. Don't ask why, it just did.   The food on the other hand is pretty damn good. The bread was insanely soft and the spicy thousand-island sauce was a great addition to the salty cured meat. The veggies were fresh, crispy and piled high; this gave the sandwich multiple levels of texture. Honesty, I would probably come back here, but would only get it to go and enjoy the food with some Netflix.   I would recommend this place to my Henderson homies, but it's not worth making the trek from vast strip mall laden lands of Summerlin."}
{"text":"Every sandwich I've tried from here is great! Good bread and high quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Hot pastrami was great! Support this small locally owned sandwich shop, they have earned it by providing good eats for several years now."}
{"text":"Saw this place as Yelp stated it was close to my home and job. Kind of off the beaten path almost missed it. I had the pastrami sandwich which was ok kind of pricey for a 9 inch sub ($9.99). Not sure I would return -Capriotti's in my opinion is better"}
{"text":"The sandwiches and potato salad are very good. But the best part about this place is the people. They are very accommodating and actually care about their customers. Will definitely be back here many times."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a long time, but I kept missing their business hours. They extended the hours to 5pm and I made it this time! The sandwiches are HUGE and loaded with flavor. The place was very clean inside and the woman who helped me order was very sweet and informative. I think I found my new sandwich shop! Thank you woods family!"}
{"text":"Swung by today with a bunch of the classmates and was pleasantly surprised.   This is a nice little sandwich shop located across the street from the school and it had a nice warm vibe to it. We were greeted by a super sweet lady working the register and she got me squared away with a build your own sandwich for $7.99  The sandwich was massive. You can add as many condiments as you would like. You get one choice of meat and a choice of cheese. They have premium toppings for extra. I will definitely be back again if i find myself with down time during lunch."}
{"text":"We were looking for something to eat and found Woods Family Sandwiches... it did not disappoint!!!"}
{"text":"Lady taking orders is so rude . Just because I asked her to read off the subs they had . She let off a big sigh. And said to look online because they have 12 subs . I looked online found the sub . Called back then she tells me she doesn't deliver to Simi trucks. My truck broke down close by . Then she rudely hung up on me . I will never eat here again"}
{"text":"Nothing really special about this place. BUT they have great sandwiches. A small sandwich spot tucked away in a corporate park.   Everything tasted fresh, they use all Boars Head meats. Fresh bread, fresh veggies. 8.99 for the large pastrami which seems somewhat pricey, for what you can get in this town for less, but it was worth it. I will be back!"}
{"text":"very good sandwich, fresh and well made. Product is the good quality. Delivery is very fast, and the driver friendly."}
{"text":"What a sweet find! This tasty little sandwich shop is more of a hidden gem since it's not too noticeable unless you are specifically looking for it. I found out about it because hubby had a friend who works nearby and he mentioned that they serve really good sandwiches here. It's near the Valley Auto Mall and other businesses, so I figure they get a good amount of business from them. I did hear the woman who took our order say they were closed on weekends right now, but were opening for a bit on Saturday to get a lunch order ready for one of the car dealerships. Inside was very clean and they have tables if you want to eat inside. The woman who took our order was nice and gave us time to look over the menu. They use Boar's Head meats and cheeses as well Boar's Head Condiments. I'm a huge fan of Boar's Head, so I was glad to see them using their products.   Hot Pastrami ($7.99) - Pastrami, seasonings, pickles, three pepper cheese, peperoncinis. red onions and mustard. Yum! This sandwich wasn't tiny and for the price and quality of what was in the sandwich it's a great deal. The sandwiches are made to order, so you can leave off or add anything you'd like.   Classic Italian ($7.99) - Genoa salami, ham, pepperoni, provolone cheese, lettuce, red onion, tomato, mustard, mayo, seasoning. Another sandwich that is absolutely worth the price for what you get. This sandwich tasted really good. Everything complimented each other well. The bread on both sandwiches was good and held everything in well.   They also have soups, salads and wraps and offer sides like coleslaw, potato salad, kosher pickles and chips. The sandwich was very filling, but the woman was mentioning possibly doing a half sandwich and half soup option in the future and I hope she does do that. The sandwiches are hearty and can be shared depending on your appetite, so I'd love the option of having half of a sandwich and cup of soup. I noticed on the menu the woman gave me they have pictures of sandwiches on sliced bread, but she said they only had french rolls as an option. I don't mind french rolls at all, but I do think a couple varieties of bread would be nice. They do have a kids menu starting at $3.99 and offer catering."}
{"text":"Great turkey sandwich & very tasty potato salad! Will definitely be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"Great quality meat and bread! I just wish they had cornbeef on a regular basis, not just holidays. I would recommend this place if you love sandwich's..."}
{"text":"I found this sandwich shop on a google map search & the shop had good reviews. It's in an industrial complex 1/2 mile from Auto Mall in Henderson. When you see the umbrella, you're there. There's outside & inside seating. The 1st thing I noticed was the Boars Head sign so I knew it would be good. It's not Subway like in any way. It's a bonafide fantastic sandwich shop. They have a good selection of breads, the menu is great. I had the Italian sandwich on wheat bread. It was so fresh & so delicious. If my office were in this complex, I'd eat here every day. It's that good. The service was friendly & fast. Eat here!"}
{"text":"This is what a family business is all about!  Great food, great service, and great fun!  Spent about 10 minutes talking the the owner and extremely friendly staff.  Everyone who works there seems to be family or friends of family that go way back, which helps tremendously with the family ambiance.  The whole place felt like Cheers...only sandwiches.  After all that the sandwich was absolutely delicious.  You truly get your money's worth (about 1lb of meat on a regular size sandwich) and the bread was fresh and delicious.  Needless to say I'll be going back....multiple times."}
{"text":"First let me just say that Woods Family Sandwiches is AMAZING! Get the Italian. Just do it!  Second, don't show up at 4pm on a Saturday, while 38 weeks pregnant and craving anItalian hoagie and a giant pickle, because if you do, you'll be disappointed when you realize their yelp page and website says they're open until 5pm on Saturdays but when you get there, they're closed and the door says they close at 3pm on Saturdays   Update: The owner reached out and made it better by offering a free Italian Hoagie and pickle! Wonderful customer service, and baby was happy too!"}
{"text":"Not very familiar with the food around town but found this sandwich place and was pleasantly surprised. I recommend the pastrami sub. Very high quality meat, delivered fresh daily, with fresh vegetables. Odd location but fantastic place for lunch."}
{"text":"Subs were great and staff was really friendly. Small kind of hole in the wall place. I definitely recommend it and would come back again"}
{"text":"Woods family has came into our dealership for quite some time and corrected a miss under standing thank you and for the follow up. This is what makes your Restaurant a great place! Thank you again"}
{"text":"This new location was more convenient as I was on my way back to my hotel room at Westgate after a round of golf in Henderson.  Obviously, they wouldn't be opening a second store if they did not have success and a loyal following at the first one.  Because the reviews were so good, I ordered two sandwiches: One for lunch and one for later since it is always cheaper to bring food back to The Strip than order it there.  The Italian wrap was excellent. Just the right amount of everything in there. And each half of it is a meal in itself. The Italian seasonings and dressing were perfect.  As an openly self-professed chicken salad apologist, I had to try Woods' version. There was nothing wrong with it at all, it just was not anything really special in terms of the taste and texture. I even added bacon to the chicken salad sandwich hoping to be awed, but it just didn't happen.  Perhaps that Italian wrap set the bar too high?  The ingredients were clearly fresh and even their cole slaw proves that on the very first bite.  Pricing seems very fair across the board and employees were clearly enjoying their jobs while making me feel very welcome on this initial visit.   Let's try a couple more things from Woods Family Sandwiches on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"In my infinite search for a new bagel shop I tried this place out of desperation and will never come back   I got maybe a teaspoon of cream cheese on my entire bagel and that's completely unacceptable"}
{"text":"I was getting my oil changed at Acura and was hungry around lunch. After looking on yelp the only restaurants within walking distance were Mustang Sally's ( No thank you) and Wood Family Sandwiches. Well I walked theee about 15 min from Acura and ordered the oven gold turkey sandwich. It had plenty of delicious turkey, tomato, avocado, cheee, lettuce, and a mustard  vinaigrette. Really good sandwich. Little pricey but understandable for quality ingredients. Prob wouldn't go unless I was kinda stranded there as it's tucked in a business park out of the way."}
{"text":"Definitely a 5 star sandwich joint!  Had the classic italian and wow, was it delicious! Also sampled the pastrami and the flavor was amazing. I really love how soft the bread is as well.  The service was as good as it gets, and they even asked how we liked it. We felt really \"at home.\"   I really hope this place blows up big time. And I will definitely return."}
{"text":"They don't put onions in their chicken salad, tuna salad or egg salad. That alone will make me go back consistently.  Also, their staff is friendly/informative and the above mentioned chicken salad is AMAZING.  Their prices are proportionate to the quality, which I'm absolutely ok with.  I look forward to going back and trying out everything they have to offer."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! One of the best egg salads I've ever had. The service was quick and efficient during a noon lunch. Roast beef sandwich uses quality Boar's Head meat and comes with coleslaw, Swiss, and 1000 island dressing but can substitute if you like. The coleslaw was a bit too wet for personal taste but still good. I wish there was more than just the hoagie roll for bread options but won't stop me from returning to Woods!"}
{"text":"This deli is explains why I love it: order form for how I like my sandwich made, fresh ingredients  and high quality meats. We ordered the golden turkey hoagie, pastrami hoagie, potato salad, and chili. Excellent chili, potato salad, and sandwiches with a rarity of alfalfa sprouts.  Finally, a Real Quality deli."}
{"text":"I love full service delis where they have all my favorite condiments down to sprouts. I was familiar with the other location in Henderson and this is closer so I decided to check it out for my sandwich cravings today. I arrived late at 430pm because closing time is 5pm so I was bummed their soups were not available. I still ordered the pastrami sandwich with a hoagie and a classic Italian sandwich adding turkey, beef, sprouts and mayo on both. My favorite potato salad is a must to complement the sandwiches. $27 out the door. This place reminds me of New Jersey delis and their sandwiches are total satisfying."}
{"text":"I have never heard of this place, it happened to pop up on uber eats and I thought I'd give it a try. It was delicious! I had the Italian sub- they use quality meats and cheeses and put a perfect amount on. Veggies were all fresh and the sauces were great. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Custom turkey bacon sammy on thick sliced soft sourdough bread. Very helpful, friendly family sandwich shop! A must if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Buenos sándwich me gusta mucho el italiano es mi favorito y la gente muy amable definitivamente lo recomiendo"}
{"text":"They come into my work often to do our lunch orders, which is pretty cool. They deliver obviously. Customer service is on par though.  Their food is alright, nothing to get excited about. Sandwiches are usually bland in taste but do the job when you're busy but hungry. In all honesty though, the sandwiches are far too high priced for what you actually get."}
{"text":"This cute deli is tucked away in a buisness district behind the auto show mall. Arlene was wonderful... she guessed we were first timers the minute we walked in. She was so nice to go over the menu with us,  explained to us the favorites.. and explained we could also build our own. Bread/Hoagie was so fresh..I had the Hot Black Forest Ham... Delicious! and My Mom had the build your own Pastrami which she loved. We are both so picky about coleslaw and their coleslaw is delicious and homemade. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The sandwiches themselves were good. The service, however, was absolutely horrendous. We had just drove in 8+ hours from the Bay Area and were starving. Went in to this place at around 3pm to grab sandwiches, and they were out of almost every meat and half the bread options. I mean c'mon, a sandwich shop out of meat and bread? Go get some more. I am not sure if the woman helping us was the owner, but she was extremely rude and not excited to help. The bread was good and the sandwich was good, but we paid almost $50 for 4 sandwiches with horrible service, not a fan. I think I would have excused the lack of meat and bread supply if the staff was nice and understanding, but the older woman was extremely harsh and acted like it was the biggest deal ever that we wanted custom sandwiches and threw down the order sheets at us, let me remind you it was 3 p.m. and not one other person in the place, she had nothing else to do. Not sure if it was an off day, but will not be returning unless something improves."}
{"text":"A little on the pricey side but well worth it, very delicious sandwiches! Always ask what the special of the day is because you'd be surprised as to what they've created!"}
{"text":"First time here... so first things first! Customer service is great.. no attitudes when asked questions! They'll make whatever sandwich you want any way you want it.. hot cold wrapped or even as a salad! 2nd- they have really good pickles! Big n juicy pickles!!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from this place several times and each and every time they are consistently delicious and friendly. Thank goodness they're around! The pastrami sandwich is the greatest and my husband loves their veggie wrap and potato salad. I will recommend this establishment to everyone!"}
{"text":"This place has great sandwiches. I hit for lunch all the time. Great to find a deli that's not all corporate like a subway or the such..my only complaint is the soda cups need to be bigger, or offer a bigger size. Plus the dude with the red beard is mighty hot.  Go there now"}
{"text":"the best sub i've had in las vegas. perfect bread, delicious meats, and perfect seasoning. this place is a delight! way better than any chain, and the customer service is great."}
{"text":"Had a group of 12 that I needed to feed and had to pick up the order before operating hours!  Daelyn was awesome and oh so accommodating.  Not to mention the food was wonderful!  Woods Family Sandwiches offered a nice assortment for any food palette, the sandwiches were huge - I made 2 meals out of it.  Lets talk about the pickle, normally places give you a slice of pickle NOT Woods, it was sooooo good.  Great food AWESOME price!  Highly recommend this shop.  Oh and they now have 2 locations!   WAHOOOOO"}
{"text":"This is my first time here I had to call multiple time to place my order because \"people are in line \" so I get here still a 25 min line to pick up the food I already ordered , how are people that have a 40 min lunch supposed to get in n out of here in time you guys system sucks . Not to mention my food has been just sitting the whole time getting gross and soggy and COLD . After 25 Min I get my cold soggy sandwich and she now tells me their is no change.....for 20 looooolll this place sucks your system sucks balls fix it not cool by any means to have to wait 1 hour for a damn soggy sandwich"}
{"text":"Wow I must say this place was DELICIOUS my god the best soft fresh bread and the best quality Boars Head products. I'm from NY and I have not had something so deliciously good since then subway has nothing on this place and the customer service is something I LOVED as well Raymond and the nice lady (didn't get her name) are the definition of great welcoming customer service if I could give more than 5 stars I would thank you guys for the customer service highly appreciated. EVERYONE stop what you're doing and go get yourself a great meal here!!! ( I got a turkey pesto  and my boyfriend got an Italian sub)"}
{"text":"This is really some of the best dam mexican food in vegas ... Im just bit sad and wish their portions were bigger ... I feel like have to spend alot here"}
{"text":"Very great customer service! I ordered the Italian and the Joey. Very impressed with bread quality and meat. Yummy sandwiches! I highly recommend this sandwich shop"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Boars Head deli meats, fresh bread, awesome sandwiches. Great customer service. One of the best sandwiches in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"What a great little family restaurant.  Sweet family serving amazing food.  It's kind of hard to find but worth looking for.  It is always a good break in the day to have good food provided with a smile."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place by chance looking for a customer. Excellent find. Fresh ingredients made to order. Tasty potato salad. Hit the spot."}
{"text":"Delicious! I got a turkey sandwich on sourdough, I do wish they toasted the bun, and it was very good. A giant pickle also hit the spot. I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Small non chain deli, way better than the chains in the area.  They make a really mean hot pastrami, it is so good that I break my adventurous habits and order it each time.  The sandwich is a good size for the price.  Work goes here most every Friday and no one has ever had a sandwich that they would complain about.  I love the fact that it is small and non-chain, plus the staff is super happy and friendly."}
{"text":"Picked up 2 of the classic Italian cold subs. Order thru yelp, was super easy and the order was ready to go when we go there (thank goodness since my son had just thrown up in his car seat  which my husband took care of while I ran in and paid). Friendly lady checked me out. Subs were very tasty! Bread was amazing! I think the only thing I would want different is the salami and pepperoni to be sliced thinner. I will definitely keep this place in mind in the future."}
{"text":"This is the best sandwich shop in town! All boars head meats and cheeses and even pickles! The breads are delicious! They have soup and turkey chili too! The shop is clean and has a great atmosphere where you can dine in or take out. And lastly one of the best parts is it's a small business that's owned by a family like you and me!"}
{"text":"Small, family owned spot - kind of tucked away, but not too hard to find. The people that work there are always friendly & great at explaining the sandwiches & everything else they offer.   Prices are decent, but a little high for a sandwich shop.   Food that we have ordered - Buffalo Sandwich - Really good! The problem is that each time I have gotten the sandwich, it gets more and more spicy. No consistency.  Build Your Own - Really good! A lot of meat, no skimping. Potato Salad - Yum! Brownie - Tasted like cardboard. Would never get it again.  French Dip Wrap - NEVER AGAIN! We picked it up & the lady who made the wrap said \"I can't heat up the tortilla to melt the cheese in the oven, so you'll just have to do it at home.\" Why offer the wrap, on your menu, if you can't make it correctly? What if we weren't going home? Not only that but the wrap was SO thin! Definitely not worth the almost $7 & not enough for a meal. Very upsetting."}
{"text":"Wow! Shopping for a new car and my wife said she needed to eat soon. We happened to find Woods Family Sandwiches and decided to pull over because I am a sucker for family owned restaurants. And you can never go wrong with a sandwich, right?  Again, wow! Loved the pastrami and the 9\" was enough even for a big guy like me. Potato salad has just the right amount of mustard to make it delicious! I may be able to convince my wife to come look at cars more often now as long as I promise that we will stop back here again!"}
{"text":"First visit. Inside in very clean and everyone is very nice. Fair priced, Paid 12.00 for a single sub at capriotti, spent 12 here and got a 7\" sandwich, a side and chips too. Very soft bread and high quality deli meat. I loved it. I'll be coming here again."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are delicious and the people working there are really nice. Too bad they're not open on weekends ..."}
{"text":"I walked in and I was greeted within the first 5 minutes of my arrival. The cashier was so nice and being my first time at this place she was very patient as to my decision on what I wanted.   I ordered the Blazzin' Buffalo Chicken sandwich combo. Their drinks are regular one size but the refills are free! All the chips they offered were only kettle, it could be a bad thing for people who are not fond of those kinds of chips but lucky for me I'd prefer kettle chips. I sat towards the back where they had a TV for their costumers to watch and eat. The dinning environment felt really homey and I thought it was cute that they had a pitched fence alongside their wall! Less than 10 minutes waiting the cashier delivered our food and asked if we needed anything else. The taste of the sandwich was good! The veggies were very fresh and they are very generous when they pack the meat into the sandwich. When I observed the meat, it was finely cut and folded perfectly. Pet peeve about eating a sandwich is when everything falls out once you take your first bite but their sandwich remained in place together! There was something crunchy that tasted like crumbled chips in the sandwich that gave the food texture and an enhanced delicious flavor to the buffalo chicken.   I would recommend this nice place to stop by for lunch, it is overall a great environment with amazing sandwiches."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicous! My boyfriend and I both had the French dips and they were full of flavor. The staff was on top of everything and very friendly. I will definitely be returning to try everything else!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch there and it was great. I had the pastrami sandwich and my wife had the Italian and they were both yummy. The potato salad was also delicious. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I've used the Eat 24 app on three different occasions for pick up and each time my order has been correct and ready by the time I arrived. I was greeted each time by a friendly employee and was in and out in less than two minutes. About a block east of Gibson on American Pacific, I've found Woods to be consistent and reliable.   Most of the sandwiches use Boar's Head deli meats and they also have wraps, soups, and house made items such as chicken salad and egg salad with prices ranging from $6.50 to $8.99. For the sandwiches, you can choose from the menu or customize your own. I've had the pastrami, Italian, and egg salad sandwiches. All three were delicious with the pastrami being my favorite. The sandwiches were nice sized and all the bread was fresh. For sides, you can get potato salad, cole slaw, kettle potato chips, or a huge kosher pickle. Although the sandwiches were good, they weren't unique and nothing different than you can make yourself at home.  If they had more house made items and continue to run daily specials, I'd be more inclined to stop in. Some house made corned beef or an open faced sandwich with roasted turkey would sound good if I happened to forget to bring my lunch to work or wanted a sandwich on the fly. The convenience and efficiency will keep me coming back though.  This is a classic situation where I think everything is A-OK, but I'm still a fan and will give the benefit of any doubt because they make a concerted effort and care. I think they still have room to grow especially with lack of competition in close proximity to the Automall. If you happen to be in the area, they might be worth a visit."}
{"text":"WOW, I just found one of my new favorite sandwich places. Had the Turkey pesto hot sub. My lady had the chicken salad sub & bother were amazing. This place is easily a par above most other sandwich places. Kudos to the nice people at Woods Family Sandwiches on Flamingo!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was the first customer at their first location so I made it a point to be the first at the flamingo location as well! Did not dissapoint me one bit! Same quality meats great sandwiches and awesome customer service. I used to drive all the way across town to eat there but now it is right on my way to work! FANTASTIC!. I have not eaten at home in over 3 yrs and I am always looking for something new. This place is the BOMB!!! Highly recommend this shop. P.S. It totally blows all these corperate cookie cutter shops out of the water. YUM YUM!"}
{"text":"Great local sandwich shop. I had the Italian and husband had the pastrami. Both delicious. Also very good potato salad. Will be back to try the French dip next time."}
{"text":"Really excited they added to their menu and are now offering hot sandwiches!! I recently tried the Meatball Parm- Yum!!!"}
{"text":"We tried to enter through the back door and thought it was closed. The owner contacted me, so we will definitely return."}
{"text":"I rarely get to the eastside of the Valley but was doing some work over there this weekend and found this place. Best pastrami sammie ever!  The potato salad was great as well.  I ordered the 6\" and it was so good I regretted not ordering the 9\".  But, after the potato salad, I was perfectly full.  I cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"I love this place. Small, family owned shop with top quality ingredients. My favorites are the Classic Italian and the Black Forest Ham. The owners are super friendly and help support other local small businesses. They're pretty conveniently located, right next to the Valley AutoMall near the intersection of the 215 and the 95, behind Touro University. Try the potato salad too, it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Bubala, you looking for a New York-style deli in Las Vegas? Look no further than Woods Family! Oy! The pastrami is just like back home. Almost kosher! As kosher as you're going to get on the West Coast! Try their daily soup special ( or their daily \"tomato bisque\" ). Order a whole pickle and ask for it cut! It's hard to run a deli right but Woods Family does it right and makes it look easy (which believe you me it is far from easy, let me tell ya!) at a price that will keep you coming back for more. Ask for a punch card. Catering available."}
{"text":"Coming from California ate at this place got to say is the best sandwiches in a while the pastrami sandwich in the French dip are very very very good I would highly recommend this place for a good lunch Family owned with family values I will be coming back again."}
{"text":"This Deli was recommended on Channel 5 News..I Finally got a chance to stop by last Monday.. around 3:30pm It is tucked away in a small strip center..it is located in the center of the Valley Auto Center..Very cute and cozy..restaurant.. The lady behind the counter was very friendly and extremely funny.. We ordered the Italian Sub or deli sandwich..This is my favorite type of Sub...they offer many different choices of sandwiches..You have a choice of different sizes of sandwiches..We took our sandwiches to go  Wow the best Sub Sandwich Ever..The bread was perfect... the Boars Head meat outstanding the Italian seasoning perfect..Coming from the east coast.. I have lived on Sub Sandwiches all my life and this was by far the best I have had in 20 years. It will be hard to go anywhere else after eating this Sub..  The Sandwich is a little pricey.. but it is worth the cost.. You get good quality sandwich with top Boars Head meats...I made 2 meals out of my Sub.. I can't wait to return for my sandwich fix...  The only disadvantage is they are not open weekends and close at 5pm.."}
{"text":"Pass this guy on Gibson/American pacific all the time holding a sign for this place. Tired of subway and firehouse is pretty good but wanted to try a new place. Gotta say the Italian sub was delicious!!! Will definetly be back. $10 for a 9\" sub and half was more than enough for 1 meal!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I own a business in the Automall and its so convenient and the food is great! They deliver and even have someone stop by and take orders which I think is a great idea! Stop by and try them out you won't be disappointed! And thank you Dakota for always taking our orders and delivering our food so fast we greatly appreciate it."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch while having my car serviced at an auto shop nearby. The sandwich was one of the best I've ever had!  Everything was very fresh and amazing!  It is a tiny bit pricey (which is the only reason it's 4 stars instead of 5), but still worth it. I would definitely recommend to anyone in the area to stop by."}
{"text":"This place has become one of our favorite sandwich spots. I'm a fan of the Italian with either a side of pickle or potato salad. My boyfriend loves the hot pastrami with pickle on the side. The only downer is it's so far from where we live."}
