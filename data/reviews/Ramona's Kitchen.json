{"text":"Small place, a bit dark on the inside because of the deco but I liked the overall atmosphere.  I had the peameal bacon eggs bennedict. Im usually wary about ordering this cause of the hollandaise sauce but this place was quite good. It was buttery and not too thick.My husband had the breakfast frankfurter and it was very filling. We really liked the home fries here cause it included other things like taro and sweet potato.  Would definitely recommend this as a brunch place. Better price and quality than going to Cora's."}
{"text":"Ok so I will start by saying the food is great. Quality is awesome. But.. A lot needs to change. I hope the manager or owner reads this because it would take it to a five star restaurant with these things.  1) don't have one server. The poor girl was taking hits from every table because there were 20 tables and one sever  2) have some options or alternatives for the side of the home fries (salad, fruit, something) 3) in your menu it says pancakes (plural)- not ONE pancake. I've never been somewhere that serves one  4) side of bacon isn't two strips. Put more 5) have someone bringing around coffee. I had to ask for it 4 times.. That's unacceptable   I hope they listen to these changes because it would make this place a lot better. Good food though, nonetheless"}
{"text":"Tried this place out twice and was disappointed both times unfortunately... I live down the street and had high hopes. I've gotten the brunch burger twice and both times the pancetta was undercooked. I actually watched them make it both times and the pancetta wasn't thrown on the grill until the burger was almost done. The banana bread French toast sounded extremely promising except for the fact that it is 3 rather small slices of mediocre banana bread and it's a $12 meal The quality is decent I guess but what really gets me is the prices A 6oz burger for $10-12? And 3 slices of banana bread for the same? They're new so hopefully they just need some time to figure it out I'll try them out again in a few months but definitely not giving them anymore opportunities"}
{"text":"We went for Sunday brunch. Incredible! I had the special: Greek spinach omelette with lots of cheese and veggies. The wife had eggs Benedict with smoked salmon. My daughter had blueberry pancakes. All were winners. But the real star of the show was the home fries. Combination of potatoes, sweet potatoes, and yams. TO DIE FOR!!! Service was fast and friendly, and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Staff were friendly and service was frequent and pleasant. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I actually pity anyone who thinks the food here is good. Over priced and poorly cooked."}
{"text":"Been there few times. Love the food and environment. However, waitress gave attitude. Therefore, didn't wait for a seat."}
{"text":"Ramona is the best! She went through the menu with us and we took her recommendations! Loved the tricolour home fries. Will be back for the banana bread French toast!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Ordered green omelette which came with 3 different types of potatoes. Very tasty and not oily at all. Followed this up with their signature banana bread french toast which was just amazing. It had 3 or 4 layers of banana bread drizzled with maple syrup and chocolate syrup. Topped with walnuts and blueberries. I also got a small nutella jar just for checking in on Yelp! Best french toast i have had ever! Service was friendly and great. Prices are reasonable. The restaurant was clean and had a nice ambience. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Overall Verdict: 4/5 stars for friendly staff, delicious breakfast and decor.  Food: I was very pleased with the breakfast that we ordered. My smoked salmon, poached eggs Benedict was done to perfection. The hollandaise was a light creamy consistency and English muffin was fresh and fluffy. I love the tri-colour home fries. It's the best of all worlds of potatoey goodness... they get the outside crisp and the inside nice and soft.  Service and Ambience: Friendly staff who are happy to serve. The venue is clean and modern. I was lucky to not have to wait, but I saw the restaurant fill up quickly. There was plenty of parking available to me in the morning.   I love how it's the small and subtle touches that make this place special.. Especially when you compare it to your average big chain breakfast place.  They also serve lunch as well and I will definitely be back to sample other menu items."}
{"text":"Couldn't have been more pleased with my meal and experience. ..service,  atmosphere and delectable breakfast.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Had brunch here and I absolutely loved it. The pancakes here are so fluffy and sweet, and it even came with a cute little jar of nutella   Highly recommend for brunch-lovers, it's a cute place to come with friends and family!"}
{"text":"A cosy owner-operated restaurant in a busy strip mall sounds just perfect. However, the battered halibut with fries, was heavy, tasteless and really disappointing. When asked how we are enjoying our meal, we gave our opinion. For rather mediocre fries and tasteless fish, the $23.00 ($27.00 with tip) seemed way overpriced. The bill was presented to us and the uneaten food, removed. We were not asked if we would like another replacement dish, offered a dessert, or an apology. Dissatisfied, we left in search of a restaurant for lunch!!"}
{"text":"Really great place for brunch. There's hardly anywhere good to go for brunch in North York/Markham and this would be my top pick. I liked the choice of egg white frittatas and omelettes, and that you can get the one off the menu or create your own. The frittata was really tasty and came with a delicious side salad. The servers were very attentive, the coffee was good, and the prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Best burger l've had in a long time!! The colourful homefries are super tasty and the service is fast and super friendly!"}
{"text":"The best quality breakfast restaurant in the area. Well prepared food with flare. Comfortable atmosphere and pleasant staff. Perfect for weekends when you have time to relax and enjoy a typical full breakfast."}
{"text":"5 stars! Good food, excellent service and very friendly staff. I usually go there for breakfast or we pick up salad with chicken or salmon for dinner and we have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"The place is really nice and what a nice change to not eat at a chain restaurant in the suburbs. Food was reasonably priced for the quality of food that you were receiving. Despite the fact that it was busy in there, you were not made to feel rushed at all. The ingredients honestly tasted so good. The tri-colour, 'real' potatoes were such a treat. I had the green omlette and it was full of real veggies - asparagus, spinach, peppers and swiss cheese.  Family friendly but don't come with big groups larger than 6 people ... Won't work well.  I would come back here because the service was good and the food was great!"}
{"text":"I had Monte Cristo sandwich and vanilla milkshake for my first visit. The bread was so soft and nice and it tasted real good. The only downside was fries were too salty. The server was quite sweet too. Nice place that I want to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Very quaint. Not for large groups or you may have to wait a long time. We were a party of two and had to wait 20 minutes. I only had one dish...breakfast poutine. That's all you need to have. The hollandaise was plentiful but was so light I could have just drank it! It was so good. I also had the chocolate fudge brownie milkshake and also good. There were even chunks of brownie! Totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"Among the various lunch/dinner in the Richmond Hill Thornhill, Ramona's is a stand out. Best burgers to be had and they will cook it to your liking which other places do not do. Great omelets, love the Green omelet either with home fries or a salad, just great, more important the staff will tweak your order to your liking, just don't go to crazy. We give it five-star great place e really enjoy their chicken schnitzel plate, not dry and not just need crimps, you can actually taste the chicken. We give it five stars and will become regular customer, great job Ramona and Carlo Had their burger with a fried egg!! Sounds crazy, man was it good."}
{"text":"I had the \"Dads Breakfast\" overall the food was good but a little pricy. The waitress got my order wrong and was slow to bring the bill. Do not try to order hot water as it will set you back $2.00 I could not believe it.... because of that i probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that if I could give less than 1 star, I would.  Brunch for two on Saturday. Dirty tables all over, food on the floor. Took 10 minutes after getting seated before we even got menus, servers were always in the back wiping cups instead of attending to guests. Food was awful, no flavor at all, tasted as though the cook forgot to add salt or anything.   It is extremely rare to encounter such terrible service at a restaurant. Spacial awareness by the staff is just beyond bad."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, fresh , and great customer service , we keep on coming back, breakfast is amazing and top notch quality ! I definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"AWESOME food. Very high quality and fresh. I wish I could have given a 5-star rating but the waitresses there are so terrible and timid. Also, this place really needs to be more generous with their sauce!"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 I would. Ramona's has always been the default because there hasn't been any other breakfast places around.   Went there around 10:30am on a Sunday and it was full, which is fine. We were asking to leave our phone number and we left to get some groceries next door. We came back after 20 minutes with no phone call yet, but just as we went back the wife who was the hostess gave away our table to one of her friends, when we confronted her she said no they were waiting on the list before us and showed us the list which just showed our name. I heard the other guests tell the wife \"thanks for giving us the table! We're so hungry\" You don't have to reply to this review because we're never coming back. You make a family with young children wait for over 30 mins to eat when you want to give your friends tables before other PAYING customers? This is not the first time we've encountered something like this and is a pretty common complaint. If the husband who also owns this place reads this is, my advice is for you to ask your wife to stop giving away tables to your friends cause it's obvious you are getting bad reviews for this reason.  Your food isn't that great to wait a long time and put up with this kind of crap."}
{"text":"had an amazing brunch experience with the family..very friendly staff, great food and a nice cosy ambience. we had two omlettes and French toast. Both omlettes had fresh ingredients and generous portions, and the french toast was awesome. At least than twenty dollars per person including tip is a perfect price for a perfect brunch."}
{"text":"Our new uptown to-go place for brunch. The  food was amazeballs. I ordered the burger and my fiancee ordered the schnitzel. My burger was so juicy, came with beautifully crisped, tri-coloured potatoes and I was full for hours! The schnitzel was delish too but the burger was better ;) Comparable with Holy Chuck burgers but the bun survives better. Prices were reasonable for the quantity/quality. Service was quick once you sat down.  Warning: Plan ahead. This place is so popular for brunch that there is a waiting list. You walk in, write your name down, how many people, cell #, and wait for your phone call.   Cant rmb how long we waited but we had enough time to browse metro, tried samples, walked into the shopping mall and check out the bagel store. Then waited some more inside the store."}
{"text":"Nice small little breakfast diner, love the wooden walls and the modern vintage feeling. Recommend the Dad fills breakfast but it's a bit overpriced @$15. Love their tri-coloured home fries though.  We got the Ramona's meat poutine to share with 4 of us so it was nice.  Kinda like the midtown Alchemy coffee if you've been. Great service, fun waitress but they change $2 for hot water though"}
{"text":"This is a really local brunch location, and it makes me happy to see how well they're doing! This is a notoriously difficult plaza that has high turnover; normally the inside is quite dead  with low traffic. This is why I was really surprised/ impressed to see the lines inside for Ramona's and the 20 minute wait. Granted the inside sitting area of Ramona is quite small, and has an interesting setup. A portion of the sitting area is actually \"outside\" the restaurant, in the 'mall' area.   I think the food is a bit expensive for what it is - I think that a meal will cost around $15.   The home fries are really good - the tri colours aren't just for show, they're actually made from different potato's (regular, sweet potato). The omelette is a really good portion size; I enjoyed the one with beef and onions. I believe they make their own hamburger patty's in house, and that it was pretty good. I've also had their French toast before - I found it to be fairly lacking and would recommend getting something else.   Fairly large parking lot since it's next to a Longo's, so no worries there! If there's a long wait you can put your name down, and grab some groceries."}
{"text":"Stopped by for brunch here. We didn't need to wait to get seated and I ordered the \"Dads Full Breakfast\" which was filling and delicious. The pancakes also came with a mini jar of nutella!   The restaurant had a nice ambiance and was relatively quiet. We would've had liked to sit for a little longer after finishing our meal but the waitress promptly provided our bill after we finished. It made us feel rushed... though there were still empty tables - probably due to preparation for lunch rush.   Will be back if I'm in the area looking for brunch."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars. It's a pretty nice place for breakfast/lunch. Parking is good, lots of spots because it's in a plaza. Staff is very friendly. Seems like everyone who came here are regulars.   After reading their \"specialties\" here on Yelp, I decided to try their Fish & Chips. My first thought when the dish arrived was how SMALL the portions were. I mean, not that it was a very small portion, but considering i'm paying $17.99.. I would have expected more. Although stated, it's a 5oz fish, at least stack my fries right? That aside, the whole dish was yummy. Fish tasted nice and fresh and the fries were slightly crispy but super mushy on the inside just how I like it. The coleslaw that comes with it also tasted good. Just the right amount of dressing. As for the.. batter on the fish.. maybe it's because we took too long taking photos(probably), it was NOT crispy at all. Soggy and sooo hard to rip apart. So basically, eat it right away.   We also got the Banana Bread French Toast ($12.99), although it was good, definitely not what I would want to be eating for breakfast, especially when I'm hungry.. it's so so soo sweet! Literally a dessert.   This place seems good, but for certain items such as the fish and chips, for $18? Not worth the money. As for other items on their menu, the prices seem much more reasonable. I would come back just to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Actually came here twice already for brunch and finally decided to write a review. Enjoyed the ambience of this place as it is a small, cute cozy restaurant. Nice spot for a date!  They have all day breakfast available. I've tried their benedict before and really like it. This time around, I had my sunny side up eggs with turkey bacon and colourful home fries. The meal also comes with a choice of toast. My bf had the dad's breakfast which consist of everything I had and additional choice of protein and buttermilk pancake.   Moreover, they had only two servers at most working since it's a small restaurant. One of the server who cleaned up our table accidentally dropped food that was left from the plate onto my boyfriend's pants..I thought that was a bit careless of her but at least she was very apologetic about it which was nice. They were attentive since they came around to refill our glasses of water. Even though we didn't need much throughout our meal, we had a pleasant experience.   I recommend to come here if you're in the area and/or looking for a new place to try."}
{"text":"Overall a disappointing experience. Service was slow, portion sizes were small, and dishes had skimped on ingredients.   I ordered the breakfast sandwich with a side salad (avacado caprice). The salad was overdressed, nothing more than some wilted lettuce, a couple pieces of over ripen avocado, topped with small slivers of cheese... not worth the extra $3.  My friend ordered the monte cristo, and the double decker sandwich consisted of mainly bread with a sad single slice of ham and cheese.  However, some positive things to say: - wait staff were friendly and attentive - the bacon in the breakfast sandwich was crispy and delicious  You're much better off going to Bagel Nash next door and getting a fresh bagel and cream cheese for a fraction of the price."}
{"text":"As I walked in the restaurant, I am already impressed at how the restaurant is decorated. It's playing jazz music inside and make me feel more relaxed as I am waiting for my breakfast. I ordered a breakfast poutine. It's so good.   Came here for the second time two weeks after. Discovered that there's another spacial area at the back of the restaurant. Love their wall made of wood. Just surprised that they will charge for a cup of hot water. I ordered a Greek Omelette this time. It was not bad, I especially like the potatoes that come with the Omelette. Each one is tasted differently. Only that when my husband tried to open the ketchup, two different bottles have water coming out. They might have put the ketchup bottles in the water before. Other than that, the food is good."}
{"text":"Wow ! The food was delicious and filling. We are a family of five and each ordered different dishes and each dish was so unique and tasty! The atmosphere was very nice and the service was fantastic! I highly recommend (it is our first time in Canada and this is our new favorite spot ) can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Exceptionally great Vanella Waffle and real deal Canadian Bacon......... Looks like they have the cooking down."}
{"text":"Living in the area, I was recommended to come check out this brunch spot.   Never have I ever been to a brunch restaurant and was refused an egg substitution.  Couldn't get a poached egg over a fried sunny side up. Seems ridiculous considering it's a brunch spot.  If you have no preference as to what type of eggs your getting, this could be the place for you, however if your like me and prefer to have a choice when ordering your egg style, do NOT recommend this place.   Also, too long of a wait."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here after craving for some breakfast. Ramona's Kitchen caught our eye because of the cute interior decor and the plating of the dishes, which means IG worthy LOLZ. To our surprise, the restaurant is located inside a plaza with other stores and restaurants - which means lots of parking spaces!    The waitress that served us was very attentive and friendly, always making sure that everything was okay by coming to check up on us (we sat at the very back \"patio\" that is actually connected to the inside of the plaza, so you're not actually sitting outside)   We got the smoked salmon eggs Benedict and I was quite surprised with how small the portion looked despite looking at photos and reading reviews that stated otherwise. Overall, the eggs Benedict tasted great! Smoked salmon tasted very fresh and their hollandaise  sauce was super yummy! The bread was not as tough as other places so it was easy to cut through. I was obsessed over the tri-coloured potatoes (that mix of potatoes and sweet potatoes - LUV IT) but felt a little disappointed at the fact that it was a bit too over-salted."}
{"text":"One of my new favourite brunch spots. We went on a Friday morning and it was really quiet. Ramona's kitchen does not disappoint. We got the Eggs Benedict and Dad's breakfast. The eggs Benedict was really yummy, only good things to say about it. And the tri-coloured potatoes were the perfect touch.  Now the Dad's breakfast... in case you're wondering what the difference is between that and the Classic breakfast and whether you can finish it. The Dad's breakfast has one extra egg, an extra meat, and pancakes. Yes, it is a lot of food but my boyfriend was able to eat it all. So it depends on how hungry you are.  This place is also probably the only place in Toronto that sells those mini Nutella jars for $2. I've looked everywhere for them, including the Nutella cafe downtown. And this seems to be the only place that sells them."}
{"text":"Tried this place one morning with the boyfriend. I was surprised at how small it was and was worried about having to wait since the boyfriend had to go to work. To our surprise, there were more tables in the back where it connects to the inside of the plaza.   Service was fast. The waitress was nice as well, so no issues in that area. For food, I ordered the classic breakfast with turkey bacon and orange juice to drink. The boyfriend ordered the dads full breakfast with ham and bacon. The food was really good but I didn't really like the tri-coloured home fries.  Overall, everything was good and we were pretty happy with our breakfast. The only small complaint which was the reason why I took off a star is cause they were receiving lots of deliveries that morning. Since we were sitting in the back where the delivery guy kept on passing, the table beside us had to move closer to our table, which made it awkward. It felt like we were there with a table of 4 instead of 2 because we were so close to the 2 girls next to us. Also, when we were leaving, this made it hard for me to exit since there was such little room for me to get out."}
{"text":"One of the best places I've had breakfast at. Ordered Dad's breakfast and enjoyed every dish whole heartedly. Loved the tri- colored fries. I will recommend it to all as I'll be going back.  Good food, excellent customer service and a full and happy stomach  -JagmoN"}
{"text":"Good, local breakfast place. Would come back due to convenient location for me. I had an omelet and it was alright, a little bland- would try something else next time. My boyfriend had the breakfast burger and absolutely LOVED it, and he highly recommends. Tri-coloured potatoes are a nice change from the usual too."}
{"text":"First time visiting Toronto and wanted a good breakfast place... I found the perfect little spot in Ramona's! The food and service were amazing!!! We all got different omelettes And were very happy. Make sure to ask for specials that aren't on the menu :)"}
{"text":"Expect to wait for a while since its a very small place and doesnt take reservations. But the food is great and the price is reasonable... The potatoes were a bit dry but everything else was good! The portion was quite large for me"}
{"text":"This was a cozy restaurant with very nice staff! The good tasted great. I had a vegetarian omelette. You get to choose three toppings for the omelette and they have a good variety of options. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Location/Service Along Bayview, north of Steeles. It's in a plaza with a Metro supermarket - plenty of parking available.  Inside the restaurant is very modern looking for a brunch place. I like how you see the barista and part of the kitchen on the side.  Seating wise is limited - probably fit around 20-25 people. It does get a little busy/crowded during peak hours. Staff overall was friendly and courteous.  Food Eggs benedict is always my go-to brunch choice on the menu and this is exactly what I ordered. What's a little different about here is their tri-colored home fries - which is essentially sweet potato, regular potato and I believe yam. I think it's nice to have something new out of the usual set up. The fries weren't to oily either. The eggs benedict itself was to standard - homemade Hollandaise sauce and fresh smoked salmon. Loved the runny poached egg. Portion was also pretty huge for $12.99. I also tried other bits on their menu as I came with a party of 4. Other recommended dishes include Morning Frankfurter (love the sausage!) and Dad's Full Breakfast - both with huge portions that's shareable.  If you enjoy eating brunch, this is a perfect place to try!"}
{"text":"Food has gone down. Argumentative. Over charging. Not pleasant. This is called hospitality service for a reason.  Not coming back."}
{"text":"I ordered a slice of Tomato and Lettuce to add to my breakfast. I wasnt allowed to get it on the side for no reason. When i asked to get charged for it, they said $3.00 charge. Service was overall bad and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. If it were possible, i would give this place negative two stars but im Canadian. You're Welcome."}
{"text":"We went to Ramona's for breakfast. I had the eggs Benedict while my friend had the poutine with peameal bacon.  The food was excellent, the pricing reasonable, the wait staff friendly and attentive and the decor had a hipster rustic feel."}
{"text":"Nice small hidden gem place! Great place for weekend delicious bkft/brunch/lunch!  Will definitely come back again! Love the ambience setting of the resto!"}
{"text":"Pancakes - very dry... Scrambled eggs - ask for how you want it, or it comes well done by default Home fries - deep fried for too long Drip coffee on menu says max 1 refill, really?  I did like the 1 piece of French toast with the dad's breakfast.  And the frittata was decent.   Overall not too impressed.  There are many other brunch places that are better than this.  A bit overpriced for this food quality...felt like a nicely renovated Dennys.  Service was alright, they were always available and attentive."}
{"text":"Where do you find a good burger in Willowdale?  You don't. You go 1 minute north of Steeles to Ramona's.  Was craving a homemade burger an this place didn't disappoint.   I got the classic (only $7.99).  The cook (maybe owner) suggested a fried egg on top.  DAMN.  Super clutch (so good).  Friendly staff.  Heard it gets busy for brunch.  Definite recommend."}
{"text":"Scouted this place via Yelp when we needed a brunch place in this 'hood.  Service was friendly, fast, efficient and excellent overall.  Menu was long and had a bunch of delicious sounding items on it.  I decided to make my own omlette, which was really good value.  I was really happy with how much of the toppings they put inside.  Bathrooms smelled really nice (that's a weird comment, I know) and I appreciated that the staff always closed the doors to the washrooms when they walked by, seeing as how we were seated fairly close to the washrooms and could see toilets if they didn't keep closing the door.  I'd be back if I was in the area, definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with a colleague on a Thursday morning. Ordered a coffee and egg white frittata with a side of sweet potato fries and spicy mayo. Coffee was average but the egg white frittata was fluffy and tasty! The sweet potato fries were fried but went well with the spicy mayo! The ambiance was very modern and enjoyable. Fantastic and fast service!   Will return again!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I have been visiting Ramona's Kitchen for over a year almost every Sunday for Brunch. We get the same thing almost every time - eggs Benedict for me with strip bacon and avocado. Dads full breakfast for him with the most delicious French toast you've ever had. Note worthy alternatives are the breakfast sandwich (which was better, to me, on the brioche bun) and their breakfast burger! Lunch and dinner - burgers and fish and chips are delicious. I've had two salads as well both were also amazing.  Over all, the watch outs are the small space and the wait list. I've waited over an hour for brunch before -- so now we just go for late lunch and take advantage of their all day breakfast.   The best brunch spot bar none in the area. Big thanks to this family run place that truly does value the atmosphere and local flare."}
{"text":"Would I come back? Sure.  Ramona's is good, but it could be better. Between two of us, we shared three dishes:  -- Ramona's Banana Bread French Toast ($13)  -- Brioche French Toast ($11)  -- Dad's Full Breakfast ($15) - 3 eggs, 2 toast, home fries, 2 meats (bacon, peameal, turkey bacon, sausage, or ham), french toast or pancakes  My main issue is I don't think you could possibly be full ordering either of the french toasts. You get two pieces with the brioche and essentially two pieces with the banana bread. I don't think they're worth their price tags.  Dad's breakfast was standard fare, but the menu says \"pancakeS,\" but you only get one pancake. If you just want a big portion of regular breakfast food, I wouldn't come to Ramona's. For comparison, Honey B Hives' Working B Breakfast is $10 and has three eggs, three pieces each of three sides (ham, peameal, bacon, turkey bacon, or sausage), three pancakes, and home fries. There's no competition: Honey B Hives is wins easily in price and portion size; taste is equal.   The two french toasts were delicious. The banana bread inches ahead, but you can't go wrong with either.  Ramona's feels slightly more polished than your typical brunch spot and the food looks great. The prices are just a little too \"Downtown Toronto\" for my liking, but if budget doesn't factor into your decision making, you can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times, twice for breakfast and once for dinner, and all were consistently good. The service was good, food was delicious, and the atmosphere is quiet and intimate. Despite it never seeming busy, it is a great little place. Even the bathrooms were spotless.   For breakfast I ordered an omelette, and for dinner we ordered the veggie burger with sweet potato fries (for me) and my hunnie ordered the meat poutine. We were both very happy with our dishes.   Our only disappointment was the lack of drink menu. Your only options for drinks are beer or wine."}
{"text":"I don't frequent this area, but when a friend suggested brunch, I jumped at this quaint little diner.   It's got a modernish feel in its very modest space.   Luckily we were able to get a spot instantly.   One of things we tried is a Nutella milk shake and the Ramona's breakfast burger.     The Nutella shake was very rich, tasted like Nutella but wasn't overly sweet.   Glad we shared it between two people.   The burger when it arrived may be seemingly small, but after you finish, you'll be plenty full.  The burger comes with a crispy pancetta and an egg cooked the way you liked.   Their home fries were more innovative as they mixed in different types of root veggies to create a colourful entrée.    The servers were attentive and we had a great waitress.     I'd definitely try this place again as they have different specials like a lobster burger!"}
{"text":"Terrible Customer Service!!! Wanted to go here for lunch so my girlfriend and I walk in and wait to be seated. After a few minutes the staff made eye contact and just ignored us. After a few more minutes they say that there is a girl for seating outside where the mall entrance is. So understandable, we look and see a tiny sign that says \"wait to be seated\" this sign was actually backwards so when you actually enter it says \"thank you\". Okay, so we wait a few more minutes and still not even a hello or anything. When all is said and done we did not even eat here. We waited for 10 minutes in a diner that is the size of a bachelor apartment. Cannot rate the quality of the food."}
{"text":"About time we get a nice brunch in north york area...  I been tired of going to Cora's for brunch...  RK is a pretty small place, family operated...  I spoke to Ramona and she is a super friendly person...  I had the egg benedict w/ smoked salmon... It was good, not Cora good...  Can't really pin point what was missing but I felt something was...  Great coffee..  My mom had the persian Omelette she liked it..  My dad had the grilled salmon...  He devoured it...   I will come back..."}
{"text":"Was looking for a brunch spot in the area and came across this palace on Yelp.  Main restaurant area is small/cozy but it opens up to an interesting area in the back that is inside a strip mall.  Service was friendly.  I had the Dads breakfast and wife ordered the banana bread French toast.  Both were really good....generally hard to mess up eggs.  Good portion size of bacon and it was crispy, not wilted fat like you see at some other restaurants.  The one thing we noticed and really appreciated is everything is served hot - from the coffee to the tri-coloured home fries, which were amazing.  I find it can be hard to really differentiate brunch items from other places, but serving temperature is one way.  It's clear they make things to order and then bring to table right away.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"Just had chicken sandwich and burger.  Both were great.  Fries were pretty special. Fresh and crisp.  Good burger joint. Fresh and well made  Came again from breakfast. BEST pemeal sandwich ever.  Like ever"}
{"text":"Fun breakfast and/or burger joint in my hood! This place is small but that just adds to the charm. I took these kids there for lunch on a Friday afternoon when they had a PA day and was surprised at how busy it gets. Despite the full tables, service was still quick and attentive. Burgers and poutine were delicious. Definitely will be visiting again."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch in Thornhill. Came here on a Sunday in January around 1pm and waited about 5mins for a table of 3. We ordered a poutine, Greek omelette, brie + avocado omelette and the banana bread french toast.   Poutine was as expected, average to above average. Fries were good and so were the cheese curds. It had too much gravy and was served in a bucket causing the fries to be soggy. Omelettes were well cooked - nice and fluffy. Greek omelette had lots of fresh veggies and was good but it lacked seasoning. Didn't taste much brie in the brie and avocado omelette, mostly the taste of egg. French toast was delicious, get it if you want dessert for breakfast. It looked small but was quite filling. The bread was dense, moist inside and a good sear on the outside.  Neat and clean interior; not that big of a place. Many options on the menu including all day breakfast, sandwiches, salads and burgers. Would come back to try one of their burgers."}
{"text":"My first time experience at this cozy brunch spot deserves no less than 5 stars.  From the moment we walked in, everything from the friendly and attentive staff to the quality of the food was amazing. When we arrived the restaurant was full but the hostess quickly took down my number and texted me as soon as a table became available. The servers were very patient, friendly and always kept a smile on even when we couldn't decide what to order for quite some time. The menu truly has an option for everyone- ranging from traditional greasy breakfast to various vegetarian and healthy options. The offerings of the menu are plenty and very unique; unlike any brunch spot that I have been to.  The food came out very quickly, even though the restaurant was full. The portions and prices are very reasonable and food is delicious- I couldn't even finish my meal and took half of my brioche home. My friend had one of the homemade burgers which was super flavourful and I had a brioche Christmas special French toast I saw in a picture on yelp (they made an exception to make it for me in march!).  The interior of the place has a modern industrial but cozy feel with soft pleasant music playing in the background. It is not big and seats about 50 in total. The kitchen is open concept with all food being made out in the open behind a glass screen. The chefs interact with the customers and are quick and willing to fill any special requests. It seems that they have their business model figured out and have put in a lot of effort to really stand out in the industry and from their competitors in the region. I look forward to coming back again to try each and every one of their menu items.   A true gem and by far my favourite new brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Great little breakfast/brunch spot. Great portions with fresh ingredients.   The dad's breakfast was great. Eggs were cooked right, bacon and sausage cooked perfectly. The pancakes where fluffy and eggs Benedict was cooked medium and the sauce had a tangy zip to it."}
{"text":"Came here a few times for Brunch and every time the food was Super fresh and delicious! I always order the custom Omlette because no matter how hard I try I can never make it at home...something about the flipping and waiting doesnt mix with me... every egg I cook is scrambled for some reason. Haha!  Anyways, make sure you come here early if you do not want to wait on the weekends because this place is Hellabusy!  But definitely worth the wait! They have an Open Kitchen and the place is \"cozy\" or also known as small but still very comfortable.  You can see your food being made right there and the two or three chefs place the utmost care into every dish no matter how busy they are.  Ramonas has great reviews for a reason and come here for your next Brunch place to see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Service here leaves something to be desired.  We arrived around 10:45 on a Sunday and there was a bit of a line up outside.  Apparently you don't need to put your name down or anything, you just line up and wait your turn.  When asking the waitress (the one with the curly hair) how the line up worked, she was rude expecting first timers to know their waiting policy!  The wait itself was not very long at all (about 15 minutes).  I wanted to order the breakfast sandwich with Brioche bread but they didn't have any Brioche at 11am, go figure...  So instead I ordered Dad's full breakfast and the rest of the table got Banana bread French toast, Nutella pancakes, and a couple OJ's.  The food was pretty good.  The Dad's full breakfast had excellent sausage and home fries, good portion of eggs.  However, the bacon was very fatty and not fried long enough (I like my bacon crispy).  The Banana bread French toast was nice - the banana bread was light, not too dense.  It was an interesting French toast.  They had caramelized pecans however after a while it was getting too sweet.  The pancakes were a little thick and not very fluffy.  Definitely have had better.  All in all, the food experience was not bad.  Service however was lacking.  After the initial order, we were never checked on again and it took 5-10 mins for them to realize that I was waiting to pay.  It seems they are a bit understaffed.  They only had 2 waitresses working and they had a full house.  3 stars (minus .5 due to service)"}
{"text":"In the centre of a busy strip mall, this little gem manages a impressive balance between the best parts of standard breakfast while adding its unique touch on each dish.  Take the pancakes, for instance: fluffy 6\" golden cakes manage to be doused in tons of butter (so good) and maintain the flavour of a lightly sweetened batter.  My wife had the standard breakfast (eggs, sausages, toast). They managed to actually cook the sausages well! Not overly salty - the ingredient quality was able to stand out.  I got the breakfast poutine (home fries, curds, hollandaise, poached egg - in a small steel bucket!). Personal high water mark for breakfast is the hollandaise sauce. How many places have a crappy hollandaise!? So good. Full of tangy flavour that didn't overpower the relatively mild potatoes, curds and egg. The whole thing was as delicious as the concept sounds.  For this quality of food, I think the prices are right on the money (pun intended).  The service was quick and friendly despite it being a busy period with few staff.  The layout is long - opening into a small interior mall space at one end and the entrance at the parking lot. It's definitely the biggest challenge of this location, but they seemed to set up the space pretty well still.  No holding back for the sake of accessibility or health. They have a mission to get a fantastic flavour in your mouth. We will return!"}
{"text":"Really cute decor - first thing I noticed as soon as I walked in. I feel like brunch places need to look good and this place definitely does. Felt like it belonged in downtown Toronto. I got a veggie burger and loved it and my friend got a waffle and she liked it too. Disappointed I couldn't get a free tiny nutella jar cause of the yelp offer but it said it only comes with pancakes. Next time, I'll try the pancakes then!"}
{"text":"My favorite brunch spot in the city!  Incredible value, service, and taste.  The menu has everything I love including milkshakes! There are so many interesting things on the menu that it begs multiple visits."}
{"text":"2.5/5   Came here on a Sunday morning around 10:15 am. Location is nice with plenty of parking in the plaza. My friend arrived before me but there was no wait at the time. The back of the shop is actually separate from the \"restaurant\" and is part of the plaza (where we were sitting). Felt like I wasn't getting the full experience with the setup being like that. Ordered the eggs benedict (with smoked salmon) while buddy ordered the classic breakfast (sunnyside w peameal bacon). The portion was alright, and it looked pretty good with the three colored potatoes. The eggs were not too runny and everyone mixed quite well.   Although the servers made an effort to check on us, it was at times frustrating. I understand the need to minimize the time each customer spends at the table, but there's a difference between that and pressuring people. We were repeatedly asked if \"everything was good\" after we had finished our meal, and had the bill handed to us while we were talking. Took it as a sign to get ready to leave, but the server remained at our table and even asked \"Do you want the machine?\". At that time I was about to ask for a refill for my coffee (which costs almost the same as the hot water?!)  but figured it wasn't worth my time. Even after we paid and they took the machine away, yet another server stood by other table and asked if we had paid yet. (and this isn't a coincidence as our table was located way in the back of the store). Leaving I saw the only people that were waiting were in large groups, so that was a bit puzzling considering we were at a 2 person table with no one else around leaving.   The service and atmosphere dampened the otherwise alright food."}
{"text":"Nice little place for breakfast. I got the French Toast, which was delicious. I asked for a side of bacon and each piece cost $1.50....so that was interesting and is what makes this a 3 star review, as opposed to a 4.   Overall, nice place, but a little pricey. $24.99 all in for a plate of French toast, two strips of bacon, and an orange juice ($4) seems a little much. Good service, though."}
{"text":"I've dined in three or four times and truly enjoyed the food every time !!! I particularly loved the burger...juicy and tasty...would recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"The BEST place for breakfast / brunch in north Toronto! The place is spotless, nicely decorated with soft jazz playing. Food is top notch, and the coffee is among the best I've had."}
{"text":"Egg Benedict was amazing!  But the price was a bit too high. It also gets really busy, so I think the service gets a bit lacking as we felt that we were being forgotten at times.  Still, this place is a great place for brunch, would come again."}
{"text":"Okay wow the food here is amazing! Great quality, comes out steaming hot and super delicious. I had the breakfast burger which was a tasty burger. The potatoes are very good as well it's a combo of sweet potatoes and other varieties. My hot date had the dads breakfast he got his eggs poached and they were cooked to perfection. The french toast was super buttery and oh so yummy! Drooling still, I love the food! Andddd organic coffee mmmm. Happy eating"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing !!!! Service is fast and super friendly !!! I got an item from the breakfast menu. And i cant remember ahat it is called. It was a hot dog with scrambled eggs, bacon, guacomole, and spicy mayo... AND IT WAS MIND BLOWING!!! The hot dog was really delicious, the guaco had a fresh flavour, and the spicymayo gave the meal the best finishing touch !!!   Talking about the dish makes me hungry... !!  I will be back to this place for sure !!"}
{"text":"The smoked salmon egg Benny is a solid 5 star.  Usually, people will have to go all the way to downtown to find quality egg benny. Ramona's Kitchen, the hollandaise sauce is smooth and not too strong. I like the lighter colour of the hollandaise sauce.   The only thing that can use slight improvement is that the staff can ask the diners how they would like the egg Benny done, soft, medium? However, the quality of the food is very consistent.  The ambiance is very comfortable and perfect for Sunday brunches. I will keep coming back and will bring my family and friends here!"}
{"text":"For my Benedict love friends (@Kris) this place is amazing.  I love benedicts but not super fan of hollandaise sauces, but the sauce here is just YUM! Not too gritty, cheesy flavour but not the bright yellow (processed) versions. Needless to say I ate it all.   They serve their breakfast foods with multi coloured potato home fries. Purple, yellow, sweet, and red. They're wonderfully crispy on the outside and super soft on the inside.   We ordered the eggs Benedict on smoked salmon. The English muffin was grilled vs toasted and made it nice and crispy but not tough.   We also got a poutine, made again with their signature multi coloured potato home fries, topped with a poached egg, smothered in cheese curds and hollandaise sauce.   I'm at a lost for words...YUM?!"}
{"text":"I orderes two todays special has no price on the menu. Its simple eggs benedict and they charge 17.99. It only tastes like 11.99 such a rip off. Im nvr coming back there. Stay away at all cost.."}
{"text":"One of top choices in the area. The food is great and service is super great. They pay attention to details in the interior design which I like it. We felt so comfortable that we could spend hours in this place. I share the picture of our food, my favorite is schnitzel with sunny side eggs."}
{"text":"(Food:)  I always enjoy a good brunch place, but find myself always going to the same few ones in Markham.  Ramona's Kitchen was a welcome change in location and can easily become one of my new favourite brunch places.  The EGGS BENEDICT was all that one could ask for.  The English muffin was toasted nicely, eggs poached well and hollandaise was the perfect flavour to top it all off.  It also came with tri-coloured home fries which were one of the best home fries I've ever had!  They used not only regular potatoes, but also yam, and sweet potatoes.  They had a really good crunch to them as well.  The CLASSIC PANCAKES were also pretty good.  They were light and fluffy buttermilk pancakes where you had the option of adding toppings to it.  I opted for plain pancakes and they were pretty satisfying.  It is a little bit sweet so early in the morning, but that's just my taste.   (Price:)  EGGS BENEDICT: $12.99 CLASSIC PANCAKES: $10.99  (Ambience:) I would've given this place a 5 star rating if we didn't have to wait over 30 minutes for a table.  And, when we were seated we were in the part of the restaurant that was basically outside.  It was Easter Sunday, so I understand.    (Comparable:)  Eggs Benny at Coras or Alchemy Coffee is always good!  Starving Artist still has one of the most unique ones to try, but it's super far midtown.  (Overall:)  A great new breakfast/brunch place to try!  Just be wary of long lines!"}
{"text":"I went with my boy friend on Valentine's day for brunch and had a very nice experience.  We were seated right away, and the menu looks extensive, with all day breakfast, salad and burgers.  We enjoyed both the food and the service.  Especially enjoyed the tri color home fries that come with the breakfast, the rye bread and the coffee was good too.  Would definitely go back to try their burgers which look yummy as well!"}
{"text":"Short review because I think other yelpers covered it pretty well.   Great food!  Eggs benny was so good with their home potatoes and veggie fries. Big eaters might not find this portion big enough for them but it was perfect for me.   My sister had the avocado omelette, it was a bigger portion with toast and home fries. Very nice!  Hot water with lemon is $1.99. Even just hot water is $1.99. I wasn't really expecting to pay 1.99 for just hot water.   Coffee refills are allowed once. I think it's reasonable. How much caffeine do you need anyways.   Service was good but not exceptional.   I will come back and I think it's a great alternative to breakfast franchises.   They should look into expanding the place next year. Space is a bit tight."}
{"text":"The chicken sandwich was the best I ever had. So was the Nutella milkshake :d yummy! Cute little place, great service. The only thing that made it lose a star is because the portions are a little small and the prices kind of expensive for what it is. Otherwise, excellent!"}
{"text":"After Yelp told us it was a great brunch spot in Thornhill, we checked it out. Solid offerings, nice vibe to the space, friendly service, reasonable prices.   We don't live in the area, but I'd go back when we're around.  I AM curious about their burgers...  Next time."}
{"text":"The Breakfast Poutine was amazing!!! A once in a lifetime experience. Also Nutella Milkshake tastes like heaven. Totally recommended."}
{"text":"Ramona's Kitchen has been on my TO-GO list for awhile now, so I'm glad I finally got the chance to check this place out. However, it was just okay - nothing TOO special.  I really enjoyed the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict and would likely order it again if I were to return. The home fries on the side were unique in comparison to other breakfast restaurants I've been to - some were regular fries, some were sweet potato, and some were purple and tasted different (not sure exactly what they were).   The Breakfast Poutine however was not that great. It was pretty much a bucket of home fries, a poached egg, and a whole lot of cheese. I would NOT recommend this dish... even though I love poutines.   The service was again just okay. I don't know how else to describe this place. The servers are nice but not the most attentive. Nothing was particularly bad, but nothing was spectacular either."}
{"text":"This very good and clean place for breakfast! I love it. You must try French Toast and tri-coloured potato.  It would be amazing if they would serve breakfast steak, but is the best breakfast place in Thornhill!"}
{"text":"Absolutely recommend to try this place. It is a cute and quaint place with few seating, but a good variety menu. The place itself has nice decor and was clean, which was amazing. Service was good.  I had the breakfast poutine  which they were creative in using regular potatoes, sweet potatoes, and yams? The hollandaise sauce was different than normal but delicious and along with the cheese curds were throughout the entire poutine (and not just on top).  The nutella milkshake was exactly as you would think it would taste. A definitely on the sweet side but still good.   Definitely would come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Food is decent but service is horrible. Food takes on average takes 45min to an hour to make some eggs. Pricing is a little high, considering they charge $2 for some hot water, and another $4 to substitute a few pieces of lettuce instead of the home fries. Staff and kitchen are disorganized, and have no idea what they are doing. Could highly benefit from some efficiency training. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I love the food here. Service was eh, and the location was even more eh (off a one-way street??? Google failed to warn us), but the food brings up the rating.   Their poached eggs were done well, so I was glad for that. I got sausages instead of bacon because I was starving, but my meal really filled me up. I think I got the dad's breakfast or something (I forgot the name).  What really stole the show was the tri-coloured potatoes. Seasoned just right, and the mix was an interesting twist on home fries, which makes this place stand out. Usually potatoes make me feel comatose after but the mix made this easy to stomach.   Would I recommend? Yes, but make time to wait because this place is small.   Also, if you're a Nutella fan, they sell tiny Nutella jars for $2."}
{"text":"Go to place for burgers and Sunday brunch, 100%. The food is excellent and the staff are super nice. I have tried the mushroom burger, Brie and bacon burger and the break fast burger. Have also tried the French Toast and Egg Benedict with smoked salmon. One word to describe YUMMM! The home fries are crispy and colorful!  The food is hot, fresh! The meat is hormone free!  They are quite busy for Sunday brunch so expect a 10-15min or so. The only small draw back, space is kinda small!  If you are living uptown or in the area give them a try you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Found this randomly - glad i did!  located in a nice little plaza, really cute decor. we lucked out getting a window seat since seating is limited. i also enjoyed my breakfast (BLT with fried egg) a lot. great way to start the weekend. :)"}
{"text":"Ambience & decor: Contemporary, Beverage: standard diner fare.  Food & service: The selection is decent for vegetarians who eat eggs.  Their green egg omelette & egg white frittata were very tasty.  Their fries are unique - 3 types of potatoes blended & roasted well.  Service is friendly but our waitress kept forgetting to bring us condiments - which we had to repeatedly ask for.   This restaurant satisfies the dearth of good diners in the area."}
{"text":"This place just opened and I really enjoyed my visit!  I had the Schnitzel Sandwich and Ramona's Organic Meat Poutine. Both were very yummy! I especially liked the Poutine - the beef used was very tasty and it was a nice sized portion also.   This is a local business that just opened up. The owners are very nice and have great recommendations to suit your tastes!"}
{"text":"2.5 Stars, mainly for the food and ambience, service was lacking. Came on a weekday morning for breakfast with friends.   Sizable food portions, generous with ingredients, quite tasty. Tri-coloured potatoes were cute and delicious, coming from someone who doesn't usually touch the potatoes on a breakfast plate. Restaurant has a warmth to it, nice place to linger a bit after the meal (although one of my buddies said the chair was not very comfortable to sit for a long time).  Waitress had lovely smiles for us and was polite, but service was disappointing:  - When I was placing my order, I asked to change the cheese (any other cheese instead of feta) and was told I'm not allowed to do that. To change the cheese, I would have to do the make-your-own eggs, which would probably result in a higher price. Come on, it's a simple cheese-for-cheese switch, I wasn't asking to switch cheese for bacon / another ingredient from a different food category. Why so inflexible? This was probably a restaurant rule and not the fault of the waitress, so hopefully the restaurant would consider lightening up a bit.  - Waitress did not do a check-in after food was served. I had to flag her down to ask for something after waiting and realizing she wasn't going to ask how everything was going.  - She did not refill our glasses of water at all. We ordered other drinks but finished those AND our water, and even though the restaurant wasn't all that busy, she didn't stop by to ask if we wanted to add more drink orders nor refill our water.  - We didn't need to ask for the bill. She approached us to ask if we wanted to split the bill. Not so subtle \"it's time to leave\" signal ~ but there was no line-up at the door, what's the hurry?  She did offer boxes for our doggy bags and she didn't display any signs of annoyance. So it didn't leave an unpleasant aftertaste, but I will probably look for another restaurant to visit when I'm in the area next time."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. I had eggs Benedict and everything was perfect about it. Right amount of sauce, crispy bacon. Good quality materials."}
{"text":"Good brunch place in the area and rated a 3/5 overall.  The food: We were starving and ordered eggs benedict and the banana french toast. Food arrived in a timely manner and presented as other pictures have captured. Portion was a good size but like I said, I was starving so I was hoping for a little bit more. The food was good and I'd go back. If you're looking for a unique brunch spot in the area, this will do. They do the classics with a bit of a twist.  Atmosphere: Nice atmosphere, not spectacular, but I do like the cozy feel of this restaurant. Staff was friendly too.   As mentioned, overall, it's a good spot for traditional brunch that's not the typical big chain. It isn't spectacular but it is a sweet little brunch spot in the Richmond Hill area (this can be tough to find), with friendly staff and will not leave you feeling gross."}
{"text":"Great, friendly neighbourhood brunch spot. My friend and I both enjoyed our breakfast. The eggs Benedict was delicious. We just found the presentation of the plate very minimal with a small bit of home fries on the side...maybe the plate was too big? :p  Otherwise friendly staff, generous on coffee refills and great service. Would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 0 for customer service I would! I have been here many times and today I was appalled by the customer service my friend and I received. When we sat down, we ordered 2 coffees. Five minutes later, Ramona, the owner came and asked us for our order. We told her we hadn't even looked at the menu and she says, \"hurry up, it's Saturday, we need the table!\" She was so very rude and we ended up asking for the bill, paid for our $7.00 coffees and left. No apology was given..nothing. If you're looking for a nice, leisurely breakfast place, this is not it! If you want to scarf down your breakfast and be treated like an animal, this is the spot. I personally will never return to this place and refuse to recommend it."}
{"text":"I do love breakfast for dinner, so Ramona's Kitchen all-day breakfast menu called to me. Wonderful banana French toast, complete with your own personal bottle of Nutella, really hit the spot. Ramona's has a happy ambiance, even in the evening. Free WiFi was appreciated. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Food tastes great and the owner there is so nice. Most people won't think to stop in that plaza but they should. It's worth the visit :)"}
{"text":"We live quite close to Ramonas kitchen and was looking forward to dining in for Sunday brunch this past sunday due to the positive reviews.  There are not too many brunch places close by and was hoping this could become our go to spot.  We even invited 4 others to try with us so I called in on Saturday afternoon to make a reso for 6 for Sunday at 11am.  We arrived promptly at 11 and told the lady we have a reso for 6, she then literally scolded at us \"you sure? We don't take reservations for Sunday, this is why we don't take reservations\" and then just stared at us.  I said well ya I called in yesterday and specifically asked if you take reso for Sunday and the person on the line said yes and took my info down.  I'm not an unfair person, if she simply apologize about the mix up and told us that it would be 15 -20 mins wait we would be fine with that.  But she talked to us as if she was training us on the restaurant policy.  No i dont know that u dont take resos on sunday and why did someone take down my info.  I don't give a F about how good your food is, I will never return to this establishment again.  Instead, we drove to smash on hwy 7 and ate there.  It's a 20 min drive further and I'll make that drive everytime because of this experience."}
{"text":"Great clean place! Food was prepared quickly and service was good. I had the green omelette and my wife had the schnitzel breakfast. Nice find"}
{"text":"i used UBEREats for this restaurant because it was quite early and this was only of the only resstaurants open.  I ordered the Fish and chips.  i was so excited when my food arrived, but when i opened my food, it was disgusting.  on the UBEREats menu, the price of the fish and chips was 17.99$.  for 18$ i got HALF a piece of fish, and maybe 25 pieces of fries. NO CONDIMENTS, NO UTENSILS.   ON TOP OF THAT, SOME PARTS OF THE FRIES WERE COLD.  I have no idea how this places gets good reviews."}
{"text":"Just so rude!! Defiantly not going back again The Persian lady was so rude with my guest and I, just because we ask her to sit inside instead of sitting outside."}
{"text":"Tasty homemade breakfast and brunch foods that are colourful and satisfying. Red potatoes, sweet potatoes, for breakfast dishes, a variety of toppings for custom omelettes like guacamole, spinach, turkey bacon, and more.   All for a very good price in a fun environment. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this gem of a restaurant. The breakfast was delicious. Amazing atmosphere as Romona has put in a lot of love and attention to detail to make her kitchen very warm and welcoming as you eat one of the many delicious meals off the menu. Highly recommend this spot. Our usual generic breakfast spot is out and Romona is in. Breakfast is the most important part of the day right!?"}
{"text":"Wow, where to start. How this place has an average rating of 4/5 stars truly puzzles me. I believe it should be closer to 2 or 3 stars.  Let's start with the good things, the tri-coloured home fries were good, I think mixing different types of starches was actually a great idea. We ordered Dads Full Breakfast and the Classic Breakfast. The classic breakfast food took awhile to come - and the french toast took even longer, we asked the waitress twice to follow-up. She kept saying it was on the way, but I don't even think she checked with the kitchen of it's status the first time we asked her. The food was ok - about par with the other breakfast places, nothing to rant about except the potatoes. The sauce they put on the french toast was tasty.   The service is poor here. When the waitress came to take our drink order, I told her we are ready to place our entire order including food. She said, \"no, drink only right now. I'll come back later to take your food order\" while holding a pen and paper in her hand! I was confused. So we placed our drink/coffee order and had to wait another 10 mins for her to come back to take our food order (SAME WAITRESS) with an iPad. It did not occur to her, that we wanted to put our order in right away, so we wouldn't have to wait another 10 mins for her to come back and take our food order. Then we waited another 15 for our food, and another 15 on top of that for the one slice of french toast that comes with Dad's Full breakfast. I actually could not believe that a slice of french toast took 30 mins to make! I wish I was exaggerating the wait time for this slice of french toast - but i'm not. It was ridiculous.    The owner - or at least who i think is the owner, came by to see if we wanted refills on coffee which was nice - that and the tri-coloured home fries were the highlight of our experience here. My friend that I came with refuses to come back and his standards are not as high as mine, so that says something."}
{"text":"A small little diner with a stylish that is hipster but does not try to rub it in your face. Classy and modern Ramonas kitchen is a place where portion sizes are tiny but the price says otherwise.  We ordered the smoked salmon eggs Benedict and the meat poutine. The meat poutine was orgasmagical. That's right ORGASMAGICAL. Crisply fries with real curds and gravy so thick your arteries will clog up just like the traffic on highway 7 (and keele for you York U kids). Topped with tender pieces of beef it was blessed.  The eggs not so much. Honestly I could make something better...actually I have. The salmon was looked as if it had sitting around for about a week and the portion of potatoes so poverty my student debt felt bad."}
{"text":"This is my favourite brunch any day of the week! Amazing staff, menu is a bit limited but there is something for everyone! A bit pricey but great atmosphere, very clean and very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This place is typical Breakfast place with no exceptional SERVICE or FOOD. The word you are looking for is MEDIOCRE!!!"}
{"text":"This is a review based on 1 visit. We went on a Saturday at 11am and there was a 20 minutes wait. Server was attentive (but we were a bit confused about the freshly squeezed juices since one said it was from concentrate and another said it was completely fresh) and once food was ordered it came out quickly. We ordered the smoked salmon egg benny and added avocado and the green omelette. The egg benny was very good but my friend says the green omelette was very bland. All the dishes came with multi colour potatoes which was nice. I would come back for their brunch!"}
{"text":"I came here around 11 on New Years. I expected it to be busier but there were a good amount of tables available and we were promptly seated. The waitress gave us the menu which was decent sized and provided us with multiple options. However, I wish that they had fruit on their menu. I ordered the eggs benedict with smoked salmon which came with a side of home fries. I felt the food took a bit longer than expected to be prepared. The home fries were tri colored -  different from other brunch places- which I liked. The eggs benedict was good. They asked ahead of time how I wanted the egg and it was cooked to my liking.   Although I didn't order it, they gave me a order of pancakes on the house. The pancake came with butter and powdered sugar sprinkled over top. They also included this adorable little jar of nutella on the side! Who doesn't like nutella? The pancake was great and I would recommend.   The interior of the restaurant had a nice feel to it. It was quiet and provided a nice atmosphere that made it easy for conversation.   At the end of our meal, the waitress asked if we wanted the bill before we asked for it. I felt like they were rushing us out although there were 3 empty tables surrounding us and no customers waiting for a table. But besides that, the service was nice and friendly.   Overall, food was good but not spectacular and I would come back."}
{"text":"The brunch is great. Nothing over-the-top fancy, but it is fresh, delicious, and well put-together. The restaurant itself is small and has a bit of charm to it, and the open kitchen is nice to some extent (explained in my next few comments). While the service is generally pleasant and friendly, those chefs seem to be under some serious stress sometimes. I don't know if this one chef (seems to be the head chef) is just a loud talker, but he seemed like he was always yelling. And given that he's within earshot of most customers, not the best dining experience when that happens. Watched him interact with a customer who had a question about her order and it did not seem pleasant. Dude needs to take a chill pill."}
{"text":"I go there often, the food is amazing, the staff are always friendly and polite. Best place in the area for breakfast lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"This is the most wonderful place I have ever been!! Every single dish was perfect, you must try delicious dessert waffles!!! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Had a hankering for breakfast food one evening and I've had this place bookmarked for a while.   Staff: Friendly and quick service!  Ambience: It's a small space but it's very modern and very sleek. A nice comfortable place.  Food: I had the Dad's breakfast with peameal bacon, sausages, French toast, home fries and toast. Loved it all! Eggs were made perfectly over medium for me and loved the three style home fries. The only downside for me was the French toast which was really soggy, but still had great flavour.  Would love to return!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast spot. Bright, clean with friendly service.  I went with the pancakes and added blueberries and the cutest little jar of Nutella. In hindsight the honey butter that came with the pancakes was unnecessary with all that goodness. Although not normally a home fries fan, they looked so good that I enjoyed a few from my husband's plate. He had the strange looking beef omelette and thought \"who knew beef and chicken was complimentary?\". So a win, I guess."}
{"text":"Amazing hollandaise sauce. Best eggs Benny ever. The breakfast poutine looked delicious too!"}
{"text":"Impressive. Why? Because Ramona was our waitress!   Also \"chicken schnitzel\" which would be Much Better as \"Chicken Marsala\" was on the menu: Ramona, please consider; just put a little Marsala wine in the poutain gravy, sautéed some mushrooms, and you have a Great Dish rather than the dry schnitzel dish!!!"}
{"text":"Very unprofessional attitude and customer service! Never come back again.  Just went there in a weekend morning for a brunch, the lady there asked us to sit outside because we are only 2 people and tables inside are for 4. This is while 3 couples were inside and all tables were for 4. No apology, no nothing!!! This is not the right customer service."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to breakfast and brunch spots. Their breakfast menu has all the standard items (classic breakfast, big breakfast, eggs benny), plus a bunch of unusual but tasty offerings (breakfast poutine, brunch burger, banana bread French toast).   One thing I love is the tri-colour potatoes. The third colour is purple, in case you're wondering :)  The service is very friendly an accommodating as well. Portion sizes are generous and good value for the price. Only issue is on weekends, where the limited seating isn't enough to meet the demand, and lines start forming out the door."}
{"text":"4.5  Pros: Food is very well prepared  Cons: Specials should have prices written on menu  I was looking for a spot to have breakfast with my wife and decided to stop by here based on previous Yelp reviews.  Ramona's is a wonderful spot to grab breakfast though out the day.    This is a hidden gem in my opinion.  If not for Yelp, you would not even notice this place tucked in a small plaza known for the Longos.  We came on Thursday and it was already pretty busy.  I can imagine this place being  packed on the weekends so plan accordingly.    As I said earlier, breakfast is all day here.  This is an excellent thing because they have a very good breakfast here.  I ordered the classic and my wife had the eggs benny.  Both were done amazingly well.  I love the tri-colour potatoes they serve here.  Each potato has a different taste and texture to give a great contrast.  The bacon was crispy but not over done which is something I find important.  The eggs benny were a little on the runny side for my wife.  I actually prefer them that way so be sure to let them know how you like your eggs benny when ordering. You won't be disappointed with breakfast here.    My wife was actually going to order something from the specials in the beginning.  However, there weren't any prices on the special menu for some reason.  She wanted a egg benny from the special menu and we thought it would cost about as much as the regular one give or take 1 or 2 dollars.  It ended up being about 5 dollars more so my wife changed her mind.  I feel like the price should of already been there, more transparency if you will.  It's nitpicking, but it helps people who would be more or less a little shy too ask.   Ramona's is an excellent breakfast spot that everyone should give a try.  They have a pretty good lunch menu too and I will definitely be back in the future to try as well."}
{"text":"This place is my favourite brunch spot in the Markham/North York area, proved by the long lines come weekend mornings. Their Dad's Big Breakfast is a personal favourite, which comes with three eggs, two meats, toast, assorted home fries (I love sweet potatoes!), and a choice of either French toast or pancakes for $15.99. Their French toast is by far my favourite, with a light vanilla infusion throughout. With $10.99 for just their French toast, this breakfast/brunch combo is a steal, especially if you want to split with a friend (though I unashamedly eat it by myself). I'll definitely be a regular for brunch, but you can still visit later in the day since they've got all-day breakfast. Service is attentive, but seating is a bit limited since their restaurant is on the small side."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Richmond hill. Their omelettes are fantastic. They used to be on uber eats but they aren't anymore which is unfortunate I could eat their food all day."}
{"text":"Loved this place! They have many unique dishes. I got however the eggs special, and it was pretty good, should have come with some fruit."}
{"text":"Ramona's is located inside the plaza, and you can't enter from the outside. They have a \"patio\" area that is inside of the plaza, instead of outside. I find it odd and uncomfortable - people who are waiting in line will be literally standing right next to you while you eat your food and have a private conversation.   I started off with some coffee. I asked for dairy substitutes and there were none. I don't recall any brunch places I have been to yet, that do not have dairy substitutes! I am not lactose intolerant, I just prefer my coffee with almond milk. There was a lady in line who also asked whether they have any dairy substitutes, and left right away when the manager/server said no. So if you need your coffee with dairy substitutes, Ramona's is a no go. I drank my coffee black and the coffee just tasted like a regular cup of coffee.  I ordered the Southwestern Bennedict, and my best friend ordered the Schnitzel Bennedict. We shared our food, and we both liked hers a lot more. The sweet potato substituted the carbs in the Southwestern Bennies, and the sweetness tasted weird with the hollandaise sauce. The chunks of avocado were cut up nicely and ripe. Eggs were slightly undercooked for my personal preference since there were still some runny egg white. The whole \"having bread or some sort of bread-ish carb\" at the bottom was to soak up all that hollandaise sauce along with the yolk. But since sweet potatoes don't do that, I ended up scooping puddles of the sauce with my fork. I do, however, appreciate the olive oil given in a cup. I don't like my salad with dressing.  My best friend's food on the other hand was a pleasant surprise. The chicken was wonderful and crispy.  We finished our food and had our plates taken out of our way. We were then asked whether we wanted the bill together or separate, without us asking for it, without even letting me finish my coffee first. If there's a seating time limit, fine. If we were here for hours after finishing all our food and drinks, fine. But without even asking us if we needed anything else, the bill was brought to us. There was a line at the door and it was obvious that someone wanted the tips.  Does not accept AMEX."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great atmosphere and nice presentation of food. It's quite a busy place, so do expect to have to wait for a seat. It is a little on the pricey side, so I do not see myself coming as often as I hope, but will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast and really impressed my family of 4.  Everything freshly made and so tasty. Home fries were an big winner for the kids. Loved the 3 colour potatoes. My kids asked if we could come back every day! Lol  Great service. Really friendly.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Was looking for a nice brunch place near North York and found this little gem in a busy plaza. Service was ok, quite busy but it's expected during the time we went. They didn't really take names down but they seem to have a good grasp of who came first. However, if you are a party of one, it's best not to go during weekend brunch hour as they will likely turn you away. Food was really good and service was attentive but we were a little upset when they turned away an elderly man after he waited for quite some time because he was a party of one. We ordered the Breakfast Frankfurter and the Banana Bread French Toast. The Breakfast Frankfurter was really delicious. I opted for the tri-coloured homefries instead of the cut fries and was not disappointed at all. The homefries was super crispy on the outside and soft and tender on the inside, definitely the best I've had for some time. The Breakfast Frankfurter was also extremely delicious. Very inventive and the sauce was absolutely amazing. The egg under the sausage was the perfect addition to the dish as it acted as a divider between the bun and the sausage which prevented the bun from getting soggy. The crispy bacon on top also added texture to the dish which made it even more delightful. The Banana Bread French Toast was definitely a nice spin on a classic dish. The presentation was absolutely beautiful and they even gave you a mini Nutella jar which was super cute and quite delicious. The dish was quite sweet but the strawberries on top added a nice tartness to the dish, just wish there was a bit more. Overall, everything was quite delicious and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love breakfast for dinner?   Located in the NE corner of Bayview Ave. and Laureleaf Rd., Ramona's Kitchen has been opened for over 2 years and their quality breakfast and brunch items are worth coming back for. The ingredients they use are fresh, food taste absolutely delicious, and the presentation of the dish is also IG worthy :)  I order the Ramona's Brunch Burger ($14.99) with a 6 oz. beef patty, pancetta, and a sunny side up egg! I loved the tri-colour home fries that comes with it - they were very tasty and visually looked amazing! I would order this burger again!  Another highlight of my meal was the side of Fried Dill Pickles! They were so friggin' good! The owner was not kidding when he claimed that their fried dill pickles were the best lol. I would come back just for this!  My friends had the Banana Nutella Pancakes, and the Strawberry Nutella Brioche French Toast! I would highly recommend the pancakes, and you can add your favourite toppings. You also get a little jar of Nutella on the side when you order items with Nutella (+$2).  The milkshakes are one of Ramona's signatures. You have to try the Nutella Milkshake! If you like something sweeter, the Chocolate Brownie Milkshake is like a dessert on its own ^^  Overall, a very satisfying dinner at a Breakfast and Brunch joint! I will be back for some Green Egg Omelette and Morning Frankfurter ;)"}
{"text":"First timer! Great location with great food! Had the \"Dad's Full Breakfast\" during my first visit and was afraid that it wasn't enough, but thanks to the Nutella shake it made everything perfect! Will definitely come again! Heard the fish and chips and burgers were good. Can't wait to try them!"}
{"text":"Was a decent place for brunch.  Good breakfast menu.  Only thing is they charge you $2 for hot water and lemon, which is a bit odd."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch two weekends in a row, both times on Sunday around noon. As other reviewers mentioned, they don't take reservations so expect to wait - we waited 30 minutes for a table of 4.   First time I came I ordered the Breakfast Poutine - it was smooth and creamy, with a perfectly cooked poached egg over tri-coloured fries and a nice hollandaise coating. It was absolutely delicious and quite filling. The fries were flavourful although they could have been fried a little crispier... but really good nonetheless. The hollandaise was fantastic, perfectly balanced and not overly acidic. My cousin ordered the Breakfast Burger which looked delicious and was served a generous portion size, only finishing half of the burger and tri-coloured fries.   Second time I visited the restaurant I ordered the Breakfast Burger and was quite disappointed with the portion size. The burger was the standard size however the amount of fries that had been served was half the size of what my cousin received the week before! Even someone else at my table who had visited for the first time commented how little fries there were - looked to have only been around 10-15 pieces. The flavours were on point as expected but the decrease in portion size was very disappointing. I ordered a side of hollandaise for the fries which was a nice touch, for $1.50 extra.   Overall this brunch spot is solid, with good flavours and excellent variety of items on the menu, but could be more consistent with the portion sizes. Our table was unanimously very satisfied with the quality of food and would recommend this restaurant to friends and family."}
{"text":"Brunch. We came here on a Sunday morning and waited a reasonable amount of time for a table (30 mins). Once we were seated, we ordered our food immediately and asked about their yelp check-in special. Please note that you \"have to get Nutella pancakes to receive the small jar of Nutella\". It was rather deceiving...which is why I took one star off this review.   We ordered the pancakes and eggs Benedict. The hollandaise was light and clean and eggs were made to perfection. It had a good running consistency with a good amount of potatoes. All the food was delicious.  Service was average. Nothing really stood out. Come here for the food and brunch!"}
{"text":"Second visit 4star could have been 3.   I got an 8hr furlough, so I zipped across town for breakfast.   So bait and switch on the checkin, no Nutella jar unless you get the 11$ pancake meal or waffle, big daddy(full dad) breakfast doesn't count and I added the $2 Nutella.  Got my pancake wasn't spectacular, waitress put the maple syrup on top of my $2 Nutella instead of on the side, mini upset.  She was doing something behind the counter(probably ipading) my last server(I'm gonna guess he's the owner?) told her something and out she went to check up on me.  Yes as someone mentioned you get 2 pieces of bacon, they're pretty big strips, can't gripe the food or portion sizes.   Do I still suggest you go out of your way to dine here? Yes... my food was excellent, the ambiance is quiet(in the evening, no one there).    First visit : 5 star experience :The hours and location don't work for me, but this is a place you need to try once.  The I was stuck in traffic for 2 hours, I was starving, so I decided to take a break, grab dinner. What a lucky find...  I step in through the sliding door \"sit anywhere you like,\" the place was empty and they only have 6 tables.    \"This must be your first time here.\" Alright, I'm gonna get pampered.... sure enough, I had the best restaurant service experience of 2016.   I don't bother asking to substitute stuff anymore, most places don't accommodate or think I'm a morte de fame. I told my server no toast with my omelette and I want a side salad. Bill arrived, salad was a sub. Bargain.  I was going to get a Cesar but I was upsold(?) but not really since I got the substitute for 3$  but anyways, \"Cesar you can get anywhere, you want to try something good, try the strawberry kale salad.\" This salad, best salad I ever enjoyed, for sure I'm in negative weight watcher points for that one. If i had gotten the entree size, I think I could skip dessert, not that it filled me up(it did), but it was so light and sweet, but filling. I'm still not quite sure if it counts as a salad, too good to be a salad.  I also had an omelette, western. That arrived and tasted fantastic. Best omelette I've ever eaten.  I got fresh coffee, plenty of refills... they had to brew a new pot for their #1 customer.  I will go out of my way to go back and I highly recommend you do too. I have to go  and re-evaluate all my other breakfast joints...  I always want/hope for good service because I was always under the impression I could make my own meal at home. But I could never duplicate this omelette or salad at home.   The only thing I'm worried about is a visit in the morning when they might be busy and I might have to wait for a seat. But at night, when the apocalypse is upon us  and you're the only one there, you're treated like royalty."}
{"text":"They charge you $1.99 for hot water and do not tell you! Takes them forever to refill your coffee and only refills once!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best brunch place in North Toronto! I have been meaning to come here for a while but they are always packed in the weekend! We managed to come here on a Thursday afternoon and I was definitely not disappointed! The Schnitzel benny I ordered was absolutely mouth watering! Portions are huge too! We also ordered the French toasts and everything was very very delicious!   I have to be honest that it's quite hard to find this kind of brunch resto in north GTA unless you live in downtown Toronto. Even so, I feel Ramona has put a lot of thoughts and effort in their menus in order to satisfy their customers. I really enjoyed my visit here and would definitely try to come back more often!  Btw they serve organic coffees here! How wonderful is that?!"}
{"text":"We went there for brunch yesterday and entrance is through the small mall at Laureleaf Rd and Bayview. It's a nice small place like many other breakfast place, we had the eggs Benedict with smoke salmon and banana bread French toast - both were great in flavours, small in portion and it have been much better with leafy greens added onto the plate. The colourful potatoes are fantastic. Service was just okay - she forget about us a few times and didn't want to top off coffee anymore.   With all that said, there are no other great places in the area so we shall return again."}
{"text":"This has to be my favourite breakfast spot - love the Dads breakfast. The French toast? Wow it's amazing. Great coffee to top it off. Service has always been great. A weekly stop!"}
{"text":"I've been told of this restaurant from a couple of friends, so I figured I'd see what all the commotion was. Decor is really nice and cozy, and depending on were you sat, you can see the chef's in action.  We got Ramona's Brunch Schnitzel, the Morning Frankfurter, and Ramona's Meat Poutine.  The Brunch Schnitzel is breaded differently than your traditional panko crust - it's a lot lighter and herby than your traditional. I was really looking forward to a crunchy exterior and I didn't get much of that here. It could have used a bit more seasoning; found it a bit on the bland side. The tri-coloured potatoes we're a nice twist however. A blend of yellow, red, purple and sweet potatoes really adds character to the plate.  The Frankfurter.... that looked like a ginormous plate of food. All in all, it was cooked well, but it wasn't something you'd be dying to come back for again.  I think the Meat Poutine takes the cake at Ramona's. Just the right amount of savouriness, but not too overpowering. Plenty of meat and cheese curds as well.  Service was great at the beginning, but I think the waitress we had just started so some things we asked for were neglected. No biggie though.  Overall, a good place for brunch, but seeing how some dishes are recycled throughout the menu, I'd like to see more creativity, because Ramona's definitely has potential."}
{"text":"I will not return.  Food was very good, I ordered the eggs Benedict and it's probably one of the better one I had.  Also the tri color potato was really tasty.  However, the service sucks.    1) We waited almost 20 minutes to have our orders taken.  There was only one guy who could take order and the rest of the staff seem to be only doing cleaning tables  2) apart from the eggs Benedict, my bf ordered omelet. In the menu it did not mention extra cost for Swiss cheese but we were charged $1.5 more for the Swiss cheese.    3) it took them 20 min again to just to get the bill.  We had to ask four times about the bill, and it still ends up going to another table.  4) the coffee was very weak, and only have one refills.  So, even though the food was very good, we won't be coming back.  That's really too bad."}
{"text":"Came here the other day for some breakfast food at 8 30 am and it was better than I thought.  I ordered their green omelette which consisted of green peppers, spinach, asparagus, and melted cheese. It also came with a small side order of baked potatoes and toast. The wife had a smoked salmon sandwich with mixed greens.  I ordered their organic coffee which was pretty good.  Although my plate looked kind of small, it was pretty filling.  I was able to finish my plate but there was a struggle near the end.  Overall, service was attentive, food was good , pricing was decent, and the atmosphere was cozy.  I will return to try their other selections."}
{"text":"Great service and food was good! I had the mothers day brioche French toast with strawberries and blueberries, and a side of sausage."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch~ Recommend the Dad's Full Breakfast, it's lot of food. 3 eggs, 2 toast, home fries, 2 meats: bacon, peameal, turkey bacon, sausage, or ham, french toast or pancakes and it's $15."}
{"text":"BEWARE!!! This is the first restaurant that charged me $1.99 plus taxes for hot water.    Service was poor and tables were crowded.   I don't recommend this restaurant and will never go back again!   Update:  I cannot imagine a restaurateur spends time to argue with me that they use electricity to heat up water as a reason to charge 1.99 per cup for hot water when other restaurants do the same thing for free.   All day Breakfast restaurants like Sunset Grill, Eggs Smart  and Cora  DO NOT charge for hot water.  As do higher class restaurants like Milestone, Marlowe and Jack Astor. Fast food chains like McDonald's and coffee house Starbucks don't charge as well. Stop pretending this is a normal BUSINESS PRACTICE.   They just lost two tables of customers (another table of 4 had the same problem on the same day who sworn never to visit this place again) because of the $1.99 hot water.  Not very smart to be honest..."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch or lunch. Went with a friend for a weekday brunch. I had Banana French toast. Yummy & very filling! My friend had an omelette. I think she liked it. Forgot to ask her. It looked good not over-cooked. I hate over-cooked omelettes. Her home fries were delicious :: 3 types of potatoes. Prompt coffee refills.   Friendly owners. It's great to have a place like this in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday morning for brunch. It was pretty busy so we were seated outside the restaurant. The restaurant is located within a strip mall so they had seating just outside the restaurant. The food was ok and portions are standard. I had the pancakes and it was light and fluffy. I liked how it's not too sweet. My friend got the eggs Benedict and it was good. The potato fries in the side were delicious though. Overall good experience but nothing that stood out for a regular brunch spot."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and consistently good food and service.  Very relaxed atmosphere and nice menu options.  Reasonably priced and a great for for this area of Thornhill...we have been in need of a place to eat like this in the Laureleaf area for a long time!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best spot that I've had a burger at... The fries... The deep fried pickles...sweet potatoes...  Omg... Everything is just so yummy.  And heads up, leave room for a Nutella shake. Its DEADLYYYYY"}
{"text":"I use to really love this place for weekend brunch. I liked the rustic look and food portion was good. Service was quick too. However, when I went today I was very disappointed..   Upon my arrival today, there was a wait list, I gave them my phone number and waited patiently. After having waited 20 minutes, and seeing many people leaving the restaurent and others going in, I had to inquire how much longer was the wait. Well, when the waitress had looked at her list, they had crossed out my phone number already and given my table to another group. I had never received a phone call from them. But they promptly gave me the next available table.  Once seated, the waitress asked to take our drink order. Since I was recovering from a cold, I asked if I could get a cup of hot water instead of tap, I was surprised to learn they change $1.99 for hot water. I felt that was kind of strange to charge for that but I let it slide.  What turned me off about this place was when I placed my order. I wanted to order the frittata but it came with feta cheese. I asked the waitress if I would substitute the cheese as I am pregnant and I cannot have unpasteurized cheese. I was told they could put it on the side for me but no substitution allowed. That left a bitter taste in my mouth, the fact they couldn't accommodate for health reasons really disappointed me. It saddens me to say that I will not be be returning to eat there again."}
{"text":"Service was awful, food came 20 mins after we ordered and wasnt taste as good as people written on Yelp and we found out we were charged $1.99 + tax for a cup of hot water. The server claimed she told us about this extra charges, which the server didn't mention this to us. This is seriously insane. Such a dishonest restaurant, we will not come back again."}
{"text":"Food was good, but terrible service. Although it was a very cute atmosphere I would sadly not go back as I felt like we were burdening everyone working there just with our presence (This is not a nice feeling when your spending money just to be there)."}
{"text":"I give this place 3.5/5.  We got the breakfast sandwich which comes with a side of fries (upgraded to sweet potato fries for 2$) and also the Big daddy breakfast which comes with 3 eggs, 2 meats, house potatoes, bread, and French toast or pancake. The portions are quite generous and the taste is decent. There's nothing spectacular about their menu or their items but it is enjoyable  They add a batter to their sweet potato fries and potatoes which gives it a hard/chewy crunch which I didn't really like.  Also the rye toast that came with the big breakfast was literally like croutons- way too crispy and dry"}
{"text":"This place became my favourite really quickly. You can tell that the food is made from fresh ingredients so typical dishes like salads or eggs bennys were more enjoyable than other places.   We got the breakfast bowl and smoked salmon eggs Benedict. Favourite thing was the different options they had for eggs Benedict, like salmon, turkey bacon, etc. - since I don't eat ham/pork. Also, the mix of potatoes was an excellent touch to make this dish unique from others."}
{"text":"Simple and modern menu, food made well, unique dishes, delicious coffee, and nice ambiance. What more could you ask for? I ended up having the green omelette with the multicoloured potatoes and toast and my husband got the avocado on toast. Thank you to the staff!"}
{"text":"We found ourselves with a free morning and wanted a little upscale breakfast. We heard that Romana's opened up nearby and wanted to try it. The restaurant was empty when we arrived with one guy manning the place. First of all, the decor was nice. The wood on the wall and the very clean open kitchen was impressive. The breakfast menu prices was fairly expensive compared to other joints nearby and it did not include the cost of a cup of coffee. The coffee, however, was quite good. We ordered the classic breakfast and the french toast. The food was average and the plating was not all that appetizing. The french toast was 4 pieces of fried buttered bread put on a large plate with nothing else, not even a small piece of green garnish. I know that we eat the food and not the visuals but plating is so important. The place only has starch and proteins. We always have some fruits with our breakfast and they do not serve any.  All in all, the place is average and disappointing - for a $35 breakfast. Perhaps their other meals are better."}
{"text":"Best nutella milkshake ever! I also tried their smoked salmon eggs benedict, it was alright. The home fries comes with a mix of sweet potato, yam, and potatoes, it's pretty good. My friends had the brunch burgers and it looked pretty good."}
{"text":"We went for a late breakfast, it was one of the best meals we had in the Toronto area.   They do not take American Express, but do take other cards.   The place is small but comfortable, we entered thru the mall side."}
