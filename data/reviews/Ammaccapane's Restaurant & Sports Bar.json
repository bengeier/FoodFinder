{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while..always looking for great, non-chain, Italian food close to home. My daughter took me here for a birthday lunch and I was in heaven. The cheese calzone was huge, the sauce was bowl licking delicious! I will definately recommend this place to all my friends, Italian or not."}
{"text":"The grilled wings we're magnificent! Dina A is always a delight to help us!! Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for over a year and the food is great.  It gets 4 stars.  The service is so hit or miss that it gets 2 stars as an average."}
{"text":"Good local sports bar with good service, food and they grill the wings."}
{"text":"An okay place, good food, however ,staff is very unprofessional. The bartender, Ryan, tried to start an altercation with a customer. It took another employee and customer to get him to stop trying to fight. It made the atmosphere very uncomfortable we had to leave."}
{"text":"I have been back two times since my last review and I had to add some new info. I came for lunch with my family from out of town. I was ready to order when the server told me about the turkey club wrap and how it was a great bang for the buck since it was a lot of food and very good.   I ordered this item the last two times I have been and I couldn't be happier. It is always nice to see friendly and helpful staff that are willing to tell you the truth to make sure you have a good experience.   Thanks."}
{"text":"Seems to have gone downhill, had the eggplant parm, more sauce or gravy in their terminology than eggplant, was sliced so thin that after it was breaded tasted couldn't tasted any eggplant. Tasted more like cardboard doused in sauce. Could eat it. Waitresses asked how they did and if it was ok when she cleared my plate but apparently didn't hear my answer out just ignored it."}
{"text":"This establishment does not seem to be a very good neighborhood corporate citizen."}
{"text":"OMG I wish we had gone here a long time ago.  This is an Italian restaurant/sports bar combo that fires on all cylinders.  Service, menu selection, food quality and quantity...all top notch.  The burger sliders were to die for, along with the sweet potato fries.  How many sports bars offer sweet potato fries???    Can't wait to return and try the pizza or calzone...."}
{"text":"I've been on a mission to try a new pizza place weekly. I love pizza - I like thin or hand crust primarily. Open to a variety of toppings w/the exception of ham and pineapple. I have tried at least 15 restaurants recently and hands down this place has THE BEST PIZZA EVER!! Shock Top on tap, Lots of TV's and a couple pool tables. I might add our bartender/waitress had at least 10 other people at the bar and took care of the other server and still treated us to outstanding service and two different types of peanuts!! This is a no frills bar, so don't expect fancy - but do expect exceptional pizza. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow this place was great. Walking in you wouldn't guess it but they have a great menu and everything is fresh and handmade each day by the owner. This place is definitely one of those hidden gems. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great local place to hang out for a bit. The hot dogs are a killer deal, and they're BIG. Well worth it at a price that can't be beat. The steak fries are also a \"must\" so do yourself a favor and indulge. They also serve up a pretty damned decent Bloody Mary to go along with your food. Two visits and I know I'll be back for more. It's a dark, cozy spot to belly up to the bar, watch a game and hang out for a bit with your pals. Check it out."}
{"text":"Wonderful, Amazing, Fantastic place! Great food, great service. Bartenders/servers are attentive. Great pizza any size from bar size  (4 slice) to extra large, wings are awesome and so many other options to chose from."}
{"text":"I am not sure if I had heard so much about this place that I expected more, but it sadly did not meet my expectations. This is a great place to watch sports because they have big flat screen TVs lining the bar and the service is good (very quick at getting you another drink). The disappointing part was the food. I may have chosen poorly though, because some of the people next to me had food that looked quite good (well, better than mine). I also ran into some people I knew, so that was a plus. I have definitely had better Italian food in the valley...I would come to this divish bar to watch sports and nibble at something, not for a great Italian meal."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  Ammaccapane's is the Best place for drinks, food and fun with your friends/coworkers!  Thank You Ralphie (the owner)!  Love You.  xxxoooxxx"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food. Great staff. Its late night kitchen hours works for me. I order and stay or will pick up to take home. Can't ask for more."}
{"text":"Quality, authentic, Italian cuisine.  Mamma always taught me what good Italian food was from her homemade recipes, and this was instilled and passed along to my wop a$$.  I can truly say that I hate places like Olive Garden and such for their American take on Italian cuisine.  They royally eff it up.  This place, however, does not.  I remember always thinking this was just some dive bar located next to the grocery store.  I never imagined that food was served, and excellent food at that.  My mom wanted to go here for her birthday, hearing rave reviews, so we decided to pop on in and give it a try.  We have not stopped going ever since.  Personal favorites: homemade chicken noodle soup (odd for an Italian place, I know), freshly grated cheese in their shakers (which I eat as an appetizer in itself), and their alfredo sauce, which is NOT to be messed with.  I also have had their stuffed shells, which are to DIE for.  The red sauce is amazing, sweet yet tangy and succulent.    Aside from the excellent food, which is the reason for the 5 star rating, this place is a bar.  They have a few games (pool, darts, etc.) when you first walk in, and a wrap around bar in the back.  Typical drinks and beer are provided, which seem to be reasonably priced.    If you are Italian, and want some home cooked meals like your Momma made, then stop in for a treat.  If  you aren't pleased than perhaps you weren't raised on the same flavor I was.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food and long time family hospitality!!  My fav, lasagna, great burgers, tuna melt and hot dogs!  Good pours and good variety of beers on tap!  Deana is incredible!  Family hospitality!"}
{"text":"Dear Lisa at Ammaccapane's, Thank you for an awesome night of amazing cutlet chicken in sauce, Cajun steak sandwich, and drinks. We had a fantastic meal, sitting up st the bar hanging out with the super awesome Lisa. She made some awesome recommendation and kept us fat and happy.  The food at Ammaccapane's is top notch. The red sauce for the chicken cutlet, the steak sandwich (which is pretty much a full size NY Strip) and the steak fries, nom nom nom. We will be back, and soon."}
{"text":"Great place, Ryan the bartender is really cool and so is the lady who works on the weekends. Good atmosphere, wings, pool, and darts."}
{"text":"The food was great and service was best in North Phx. Nicole was very pleasant and made sure we were taken care of....always a great local spot."}
{"text":"A little fun personal factoid.  I lived just a mile down the road from Ammaccapane's back until I was 6 years old.  Back then however, this little corner was a Winchell's Donut shop (which I begged my Dad to take me to as many times as possible).  I've only made two visits to Ammaccapane's in my lifetime and each of those visits had a different feel.  If we're going off of the most current information (as any good Yelp review should), Ammaccapane's has made some subtle but noteworthy improvements over the years.  Its a fairly benign sports bar in the grand scheme of things, but it at least seems like they're moving in the right direction.  For opening Sunday of NFL season, I came here with a couple of buds for drinks and grub while watching a Cards game.  On the northwest corner of 7th St and Thunderbird, you'll see a strip center anchored by Safeway with a small sports bar on the far north end of the strip center.  The founder of this local establishment is Ralph Ammaccapane, father of ASU alum and former LPGA golfer Danielle Ammaccapane.  Danielle along with her younger sister (and fellow LPGA pro) Dina and their Dad opened this restaurant back when Phoenix's lone LPGA golf event was held annually just down the street at Moon Valley Country Club.  While the LPGA tournament is no longer held at Moon Valley, the restaurant has endured for decades and is a popular spot for NFL Sunday gatherings.  The last time I visited this place it was a sports bar bordering on a dive.  The lighting was almost non-existent, the furniture and flooring were weathered, and the food was subpar (even by sports bar standards).  This time around, the place had undergone some subtle but noticeable changes.  They've improved the lighting ever so slightly, the flooring has been replaced, the wait staff was much more attentive, and the entrance has a fresh new look.  Overall it has a much more welcoming energetic feel than in years past.  Even though NFL games start pretty early during the warm months (10am until November), one can work up a pretty good appetite whilst watching multiple games at once.  There's about a dozen beers on tap so I got a mini pitcher of Shock Top to start with (the mini pitcher is basically two full beers, FYI).  The food menu here is pretty lengthy with a variety of bar classics as well as full sized meals taking their cues from influences of all types.  On the weekends they offer a number of traditional breakfast items as well, but I was more interested in lunch.  Under the section labeled \"Ralph's Suggestions\" there was a sausage and spinach stuffed shells entree that looked pretty enticing.  There were four shells in all on this dish.  While the cheese and meat sauce were perfectly adequate, I gotta admit I didn't pick up much of the spinach or sausage I was expecting.  There were a few small chunks of sausage I could pick up, but almost no spinach texture at all.  It had decent flavor and the shells themselves were cooked right, but overall the dish was disappointing.  And for $12, I would expect a pretty hefty dish that would leave me full.  Not so with this iteration.  The Shock Top pitcher was priced right at $8, but probably did more to fill my stomach than the shells entree.  Total for the food, drink, tax, and tip came to about $25.  So while the aesthetics of this sports bar are on the up and up, the menu (at least based on my two visits here) has not.  Measured up against other sports bars here in town this place is probably middle of the road overall.  Plenty of TVs with great vantage points throughout the restaurant, good staff, and a pretty vast selection of drinks and food.  The food is still not great in my opinion, though not many sports bars deliver on that front anyway.  If you're just coming here for some cold ones and to watch a big game, this place will get the job done.  If you're hoping for a good meal to go with it, you'll likely walk away feeling pretty meh like I did.  Take my two cents for what its worth and run with it as you see fit."}
{"text":"I consider this place my local bar. I live down the street in the Moon Valley area and it's always a great late-night choice. The beer selection is nice and the food isn't bad. Their kitchen's selection is not your average bar food. They have full pasta dishes, sandwiches, pizzas and a bunch of other great menu items. They have TVs surrounding the bar with sports on constantly. The service is quick, attentive and pleasant. Look the menu up on their website and call in your order, they'll have it ready. Try the Mexican Pizza."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group of 49 people. The management was alerted to the group and that they would be eating dinner. The management did not staff the kitchen and wait staff to accommodate this group. It took over 45 minutes to get the food to our group. Staff did he best they could under the circumstances.     Once the food arrived it was very good. This made up for the wait. Drinks were strong and the staff were friendly. The place had a Heath score of A. Plates were hot and the food delicious. Would stop here again when not sign with a group to see how the food is delivered."}
{"text":"Ammaccapanes very bad customer service will keep me from ever stepping foot inside again. I work near buy and myself and coworkers frequent it. Lindsay the bar tender and john the bouncer have alway treated me very well. Oct 6 2013 1030pm I took a friend there for a beer and wings. The male bartender put in my order and brougt me a sm pitcher of kilt. My friend got a blue moon. I was waiting for my wings it wasn't busy as I finished my 1st beer. Second beer down still no wings last half beer started and I asked bartender to cancel wings. If I can't enjoy them with the beer what's the point. He acted as if I was being an a$$. And told me he won't void it cause he will have to pay for it. All with attitude. He checked the ticket time and it was over22 min for Wings wtf. I'm not paying for them I stated. He then explained how his boss the owner makes them pay for all voids and walkouts. This is illegal. The attitude and the owner being a jack hole is why I will never return. I will miss lindsay she was always great. If the male bartenders story was true or not. I paid for the drinks gave the tender some labor advice tipped to cover the wings and left. Sad and unhappy. This place craps on it guests threw the owners bad managing and the male bartender has no clue what customer service is about. Don't waste your time or money here unless lindsay is at the bar. Really."}
{"text":"First time here. Waitress friendly and attentive. Ordered chicken alfredo fettuccine and stuffed shells Laura's style. One word. Amazing! Will definitely be back again. Delicious food and price was reasonable. Fountain drinks not too good but not a deal breaker. EnO"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick beer while we finished watching a baseball game.  Great little dive bar that appeared to have some decent food.  Next time I am in the moon valley area I will have to give the food a try."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that this is a 5 STAR REVIEW for a Sports Bar, not to be confused for a 5 star review for Ruth's Chris, or the like.  As far as sport's bars go, this is one I'm happy to go to to.  It's really big, with a room filled with pool tables, 4-6top tables where you can sit, eat, visit, and watch some games, and seats around the bar, where you can sit and watch games.  All the food is consistently satisfying. The environment is friendly and many of the folks are regulars, who have been seeing each other for years.  Great burgers and steak fries."}
{"text":"Omg I have never been to a bar with food this good stared with mac n cheese popper Amazing chicken noodle soup like grandma would make. Then the fettuccine alfredo and Laura's stuffed shells with bacon and mushroom it was like butter so rich and creamy. I loved it."}
{"text":"This is a five star joint with one exception. The wings were very good, and the pizza, while it took a long time was surprisingly good. Our waitress Shelbie was caught off guard when our unexpected large group arrived but she worked her ass off and was very nice. HOWEVER, the road hard and put away wet grumpy old lizard looking bartender should get a new job. Had a really poor attitude, no customer service, and was obviously upset that we brought in a bunch of new business and she had to actually work."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying there is nothing fancy here. This is your typical sports bar with ample bar seating and lots of TV's to take in the game.  What draws me in here is the kick butt hot dogs that they do on the weekends only. They are all beef and killer! 1/4 lb and the best part, they are only $2.50 each.  There are pool tables here if you want to shoot a few. Or, lose a few. Put your quarters up sucker!   They  are located next to a newly renovated Safeway. Oh, I forgot to mention that they do breakfast too. Just in case you slept in the parking lot after closing time.  Anyway, it is a Moon Valley locals hangout. Don't worry, the scariest part about this area is getting run over by a golf cart or having a transient in designer jeans and Air Jordan's asking you for cash.  Anyway, good stuff here... Check them out.  #irishcatv2 #vinosquared #vino2 #vino2ultimate #rebelfoodandwine #ammaccapanes"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Ordered medium-well (some pink) patty melt and fries.  Fries were not fresh but frozen junk and burger was dripping in so much blood the bread was soaked through.  Lost my appetite and left."}
{"text":"Best hamburger in town. I was born here and have had burgers all over the valley, this one is by far the best and always comes out at the temp requested. Wings, fries and  O rings are awesome too. Pizza is pretty good."}
{"text":"I must emphasize that this is first and foremost a BAR. There are tables as well as the bar area to sit at, but it is a BAR. DO NOT go here thinking it will be sit down Italian restaurant like Aiello's etc.   The food was very good. The chicken fettuccine was tasty with the grilled chicken. The rolls? Meh. But then when did you go to a restaurant for the rolls? Unless you are a freak that goes to Olive Garden and eats their swill just to get those damn processed breadsticks.  AGAIN, THIS IS A BAR. Don't post a review slamming the decor when you didn't do your research first."}
{"text":"Bar & restaurant.  In that order.  Danielle Ammaccapane was an LPGA player, graduated from Thunderbird HS just a few miles away...as did her LPGA-player sister, Dina.  I went to THS and graduated same year as Danielle (1983), just sayin...  I love this place.  It's a great \"Cheers\" style bar, as much as one loathes hearing that type of characterization.  Italian food here is solid, and the cocktails have a punch.  Nice place to watch football at the bar when by oneself, too."}
{"text":"Extra crispy wings come out extra crispy - YUM!  Tee Burger very tasty.  Golf and college basketball..... a great Saturday in Phoenix.  Thank you Donna!"}
{"text":"What to do on the night before Christmas Eve... as I drive around and notice everything is closed at 10PM and the hunger sets in, a lightbulb goes off as I see Ammacapane from yonder! Didn't know what to expect or that they would even serve food this late at night and I was excited to see the kitchen open and a good crowd on hand! Thank you miss bartender lady Lisa for hooking up the gin tonic and vodka and cranberry cocktails. Full menu and for whatever reason the Stromboli (calzone) was delicious! What sealed the deal with the Stromboli was the marinara sauce that was so fresh and tasty . The food and drinks were on point that i had to get an order to go of medium flavored wings. By the way the bartenders are pour generously and affordable prices !"}
{"text":"Great wings and a solid local hang out. Numerous beers on tap. One giant horseshoe shaped bar that takes up half the restaurant. Lots of tvs and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"A Moon Valley staple,  everyone has been here.  Best mixed drinks and they have my favorite beer,  Kiltlifter. Food is not too bad,  especially the crispy chicken fingers.  Yes I know they are frozen,  but they always come out hot amd crispy to go with your beer!"}
{"text":"Good food great service and atmosphere!  We stopped in for a quick Drink and really dug it.  Super comfortable friendly employees, drinks are priced right.  HD tv everywhere and just cozy sit down place to hang out and relax.  Go now."}
{"text":"I've been coming here off and on for a few years now. The food is always good. The bar pie is excellent and just enough. Dina and the rest of the staff are friendly and accommodating. Plenty of televisions and games to keep you occupied. Probably the most comfortable bar seats around"}
{"text":"Rýan the bartender made the best chocolate martini  I had in a long time. Simply great!"}
{"text":"Great Place for drink, sports and pub food!"}
{"text":"Our local place for years.  Used to be able to work here while drinking and eating. WiFi went away a few weeks ago when they installed some security cams over the bar.   We've reported the problem to the staff, but no correction.  Terrific staff, terrific place, but no attention to modern needs, so not for workers anymore.  Onward to other places nearby.  Update:  WiFi is all good now, and it's our fave place again.  Cheryl, Dina, and the rest of the staff are terrific--and fun--servers."}
{"text":"My husband and I are not regular or even social drinkers, however we decided to have a couple hours to ourselves and walked to ammaccapanes.  I had the best time because of the bartender and dart board! My husband and I drank blue moon and cars, shot darts, listened to music and had great conversations with the bartender. We had such a good time we decided we wanted to do it more often and have been back a couple times since.  GREAT PRICES AND BEST WINGS EVER"}
{"text":"Terrible. Wings arrived cold, spaghetti tasted like they opened a can of tomato paste. French fried in old oil grease. I will admit the 8\" bar pizza and the Shock top was good but one can't ruin that.  As I was posting this/or the tip was up for discussion suddenly, the waitress whom never had time to talk to us apologized about some of the deficiencies. Not sure if Cheryl was being genuine or fishing for a tip but the timing was off."}
{"text":"The most authentic home made food I have ever had! The chef is fantastic! Must try the shells Laura style!!!"}
{"text":"Not even worth it. Sports bar on moon valley, it's the only one. It's a good sport if your looking for that but it's not my favorite spot"}
{"text":"Service was great! But it was so hot inside it was hard to stay for too long. Walking by an open door felt so much cooler then it was inside and it was still 90 degrees outside. Heard other customers saying how hot it was when they walked in"}
{"text":"This place surprised me. The bar is huge, they have pool tables, and the atmosphere is laid back. Will return."}
{"text":"Good old fashioned Italian food.  They make their own ricotta cheese and sauce homemade there.   I especially love their shells and their eggplant appetizer.   Good calzone and ravioli, too.  Not the prettiest place but I come back because their food is so good"}
{"text":"I'm probably not a good reviewer because I only review the places that I like to go and ammacapanes or  Amico panties as my phone calls it....is my favorite local bar. The staff is great the prices are very good the beers are cold and the food is awesome... It's not too loud not too quiet and I've never had a bad time yet except that one time I had a bad time. That wasn't a good time but it wasn't their fault it was a jerky loudmouth guy who had a really annoying girlfriend who laughed  like an eight-year-old girl and really creeped me out.  but other than that it's awesome"}
{"text":"Nice place with decent menu selections and good variety from Italian to sandwiches and American Burgers etc"}
{"text":"This place is close to home.  Food, prices, and drafts are all average in my opinion."}
{"text":"I don't get the 5 star reviews.  I'm not a fan.  Went with there a few nights ago and had the ravioli, friends had the chicken fetticine alfredo. It was bland and uninspired.   No zest.  On the upside, the football was entertaining - lots of games on, good amount of TVs. The service was on par.   The food was just not great as suggested by others.There are better unassuming Italian eats in the valley."}
{"text":"I love it here. Great pizza and wings! Actually everything on the menu is delicious! Nice family owned and operated atmosphere and drinks are poured generously!"}
{"text":"Outstanding place! Great food and tap beers. All the food is great. I love the burgers and of course the steak sandwich. NY strip on great bread. Great meal for the price point.  Best steak sandwich I've ever had!"}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with any of the Italian dishes on the menu.  Eggplant and white clam linguine are delicious."}
