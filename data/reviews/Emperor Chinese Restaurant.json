{"text":"This place is failing in every way: their service is dismal, their food is greasy/tasteless/disgusting, and the kitchen/dining room are absolutely filthy. I have no idea how or why they continue to remain in business, but I would suggest that if you ever must make the mistake of consuming this disgusting excuse for food, then for goodness sake dine in."}
{"text":"I am giving this place one star - for leaving 4 menus on my door and floor in the condo building I live in - I would think 1 menu would be enough, not that I wanted it..."}
{"text":"Sa cha beef was very decent. Good service, relatively clean. I'll come back."}
{"text":"Quick, decent nothing amazing. the fried rice was good and egg drop soup decent. if you're looking just to crave a Chinese craving it works."}
{"text":"Love the food, but hate the service! Pay for extras that you don't get when ordering in. Called, but they want to tell you what's happened actually didn't happen and is not true... Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Had my food  delivered  for the first time  from this  restaurant.   The man that delivered  my food was very rude. I deserve  an apology and some free food. Soo  rude."}
{"text":"Any overall rating of two.....that's gracious.  What they do is flood downtown condos with their menus leaving on doors of unoccupied homes. This is a trash and security problem.  They left a flyer on my door 5th floor.  I called and delivery took forever. They finally called and said they were downstairs. The asked ME to come get the food! Guy said he could not come up. So you can find my place to leave a flyer but you can't bring me my food. Told them to take back and I would never order from them again.   Twenty minutes later a guy with horrible attitude and very broken English started yelling and screaming. \"Me never come back here\". More fun upon opening the container. Lo Mein might has well been served in a bowl of Wesson Oil. The Seseme Chicken was worse than a frozen meal found in stores.  So to the \"me never come back here\" guy.... No worries on that"}
{"text":"Okay so, the interior does seem a bit \"dingy\" as others have said (though I myself never use that word), but I don't eat in so that doesn't bother me.  Also I should probably say that my five-star rating is for the one thing I always get, because I only ever get one thing over and over and over.  Chicken with mushrooms.  They don't technically HAVE just chicken and mushrooms on the menu, so they ring me up as \"Chicken broccoli - only mushrooms.\"  It's always damn delicious, and I get the large size which comes to $8.88 and eat half for lunch then reheat the other half for dinner.  (It actually tastes better reheated, somehow.)  My boyfriend has gotten the sesame chicken and the orange chicken and finds them delicious, so maybe that'll help those of you who eat more than just one thing over and over.  Funny note:  The guy who's always there to ring me up has gotten to know me and that I never order anything different.  Once he caught on, at first it was, \"Chicken mushroom?\"  Which changed to \"Chicken mushroom...\" (not a question but a statement) and eventually that became, \"Eight eighty-eight.\"  XD"}
{"text":"Although the price is right and the fried rice is pretty good, it's severely overshadowed by the \"off\" taste of the beef and chicken dishes.  The beef with scallion is 90% bamboo shoots, which isn't even listed as an ingredient, and the dumplings are incredible hulking globs."}
{"text":"Nothing extraordinary here, but I will keep coming back.  Food: Good, exactly what you'd expect Atmosphere: Dingy, but friendly Service: Kind, Quick  I've only gotten take-out from here, so I can't say what a dine-in experience would be like. However, I like what I've gotten when I've visited this place. The girl behind the counter is very talkative and friendly, while the restaurant itself is dingy and could use serious updating. But a friendly, welcoming atmosphere is all I'm looking for in a to-go chinese restaurant. The food is always hot, I get exactly what I ordered, and it comes out fairly quickly so I've never had to wait very long. All in all, I think a make-over would give this place a whole new feel and the food would come off better because the decor is the only thing that leaves a bad taste in your mouth."}
{"text":"Given this place a few tries. The staff is always super nice, but the food is a bit lack luster. The sauce does taste like it comes from a can and the crab Rangoon was chewy and soft like it had just been thawed out.   I ordered sesame chicken and I had two pieces before I discovered the long black hair going all through the dish. I was finished after that. This place is ok but I wish they would clean it up just a bit and take more care with how they prepare food. This was the last time I'll be here."}
{"text":"Yes the place looks dirty on the inside, but how many restaurants do you know of that have been in business 20 something years and are not a little dirty.   I say 20 something because I grew up in that area and am pretty damn sure I remember a chinese joint always being in that strip center.  With in the last year I have been 3 times and have ordered delivery probably twice.   Here is what I do know,  I WILL PUT THEIR CRAB RAGOONS UP AGAINST ANY OTHER CHINESE JOINT!!!!!  I love them!   I usually judge a Chinese place, based on the BBQ Spare Ribs, but these these Ragoons are worth mentioning.     You don't even need the dipping sauce.  As to the service and delivery time,   the guy who waited 90 minutes, did you happen to order at 5 pm?  or maybe a Fri night?   Possibly they kitchen had only one cook or there was only one driver, who knows.   I can say my 5 or 6 times, no complaints on timeliness.  A hair on your food?   Really?   Do you wash every vegetable and fruit that comes into your house?  Make sure you scrub it really good bc those insecticides leave a residue that cant be just rinsed off, not to mention the field workers that collected the vegetables for you.  Btw, do you think they have bathrooms with sanitary wipes in the crop fields?   Pick the hair off and enjoy the crispy noodles. sheesh.      A grumpy cashier,  well maybe you would be grumpy too after a long day working to feed your extended family.  Or maybe the customer before you was a total jerk to the guy and he was trying his best to hold it in.       It is a family restaurant, not some corporate crap hole, be glad there are still some entrepreneurs out there willing to put up with ungrateful customers so they can feed their families and make an honest living."}
{"text":"Of all the Chinese places I love and admire this was probably to worst tasting one. Or I can it's basic. I always do family style meals and order 100 dollars plus in Chinese food everywhere I go. I decided to try this place bc of the post mates app deliver it and I was lazy. Food comes, 6 orders of chicken wings, super salty! Which I like salty but this was excessive and had no flavor just salt the breading on the wings was completely clumped together and burnt and hard. Was really disappointed about that. Egg foo young was good, but the brown gravy that go with it. WORST I EVER HAD pretty sure it was rice wine reduced with say"}
{"text":"I told my friend that if I didn't find any \"foreign objects\" in my sesame chicken, I'd give the place a five star rating . But honestly, the food is ok. The egg roll is slacking but the chicken was pretty good. I'm not gonna lie, the place is really dirty. If you go in the restrooms, you will be met by a family of cockroaches. They're friendly though so no worries . ***ACTUAL RATING*** Food - 3.5 out of 5 stars Sanitation - 1 out of 5 Service - 4 out of 5"}
{"text":"I wish zero stars were an option. I placed a delivery order and was told it would take 30-45 minutes to arrive. After waiting for 90 minutes and placing three calls to the store, my food arrived. When opening the bag, I had a feeling this food wasn't worth the wait. My beef/broccoli was chewy, cold, and unappetizing. I ate a few bites and tossed most of it in the trash. Do not eat at place and whatever you do, don't get their takeout service. Go to Tapei Express on Providence for great Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"This place is close to my office which is convenient.  I have eaten take out from here at least 10 times and have yet to be disappointing.  I don't expect a whole lot from a Asian take out place.  Consistent food quality, clean, and most important to me for judging Chinese food is a fresh cooked egg roll.  There is no reason to precook them and let them stew in their own grease.  I have yet to have an experience to not come back here."}
{"text":"We used to go to the Emperor years ago with our young children and had fond memories of the place.  It was a mom & pop shop, nice ambiance and friendly service at good prices.   After some shopping at the Metropolitan my husband wanted to go to the Emperor for a quick dinner.  There were no other diners in the restaurant.  Evidently this place is now pretty much a take-out joint, maybe has some lunch business, but is not longer a place to enjoy a sit down meal. We were gruffly greeted by the sole person at the desk, brought over some fried noodles and duck sauce while we considered the menu.    We ordered the Szechuan Shrimp and Scallops and also the Shrimp in Garlic Sauce.  I will say that the food was plentiful and not bad, but I will never go back.  The place appears dirty, the service is not friendly.  Never asked if we needed or wanted anything else.  Didn't seem to care about having sit-down customers at all.  Just a bad experience all around.  Gross."}
{"text":"I can't say my expectations were too high, but I definitely expected better.  My cashew chicken was inedible, and I was only able to eat the fried rice and egg roll (which were fine).  The chicken was so chewy that I could not bring myself to take a second bite.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Awful. I ordered satay wings, crab ragoon and green curry with beef. The wings were soggy. The crab ragoon tasted like store bought vegetable cream cheese with string carrots mixed in. The WORST green curry, the beef was weird. I never find it funny when I hear ppl joke about cat meat but I'm telling you I've had beef from many restaurants throughout the years-that was not beef. Disgusting."}
{"text":"I'm a former normal customer but this last time was so terrible that I'll never come back. I ordered two pepper steak dinner combos well done. First of all the meat wasn't done at all it didn't look nor taste like steak, then the rice was hard and the egg rolls were very old... The food here used to be good now it's trash. Take my advice DO NOT EAT HERE !!!"}
{"text":"Very dirty and disgusting. Sat down and he brought out egg noodles and duck sauce. Long black hair right on top. Got up and walked out."}
{"text":"I don't think it was that bad.  I think some yelp reviewers over exaggerates their reviews and make it worst than it is. My colleague and I ate here for lunch because she recommended it. I didn't feel like eating Chinese food, but decided what the heck. I'll try this hole in the wall Chinese joint since they offer vegetarian options. I ordered the lunch special \"Sa Cha Tofu\" and a sweet tea. The total? $6.00. Straight up cheap!  My dish was hot! I didn't know what Sa Cha Tofu was, but I was feeling adventurous, so I ordered it.  It was good vegetarian dish that came with a complimentary egg roll. \"Sa Cha Tofu\" is basically a stir fry with Siracha. It's hella hot!  I didn't care for the egg roll though. I prefer the Philippine lumpia version 'cause the wrapper is thinner.  They have a variety of vegetarian dishes here that range from $4.75 to $7.75. This is a great option if you are on a budget.  They also deliver which is nice. I usually stay at uptown Crowne Plaza, so the next time I come to Charlotte I will order something here for delivery."}
{"text":"My quest for great (Americanized) Chinese food continues....this spot was fine. Nothing to write home about, and nothing so amazing that I want to come back for a second trip. But, it also wasn't bad. I did dine-in, and the decor/inside definitely left something to be desired. The hot and sour soup was good, more tofu in it than I like (I prefer more of a mix with the veggies, not tofu soup) and the dumplings were decent, a little on the small side with filling, but they had good flavor.   There was a good amount of take out service happening and it seemed like they also did delivery. There's nothing wrong with this place, or with their food, but I keep wanting something more with all the Chinese spots in Charlotte, and this was he same. The food was just average at best, and a little more pricy (outside of the lunch specials)."}
{"text":"Two TERRIBLE delivery experiences.  #1 - They claim 35 minutes for it to be delivered and it took 90 minutes.    #2 - They claim 30-45 minutes for it to be delivered and it took 80 minutes.  Not only does the delivery take FOREVER, but they food is not even very good (chewy) and the people on the phones are very rude.  I will not be ordering here again and would advise everyone else from ordering from here."}
{"text":"Best place we have found for chinese deliverybclose by. They are always prompt with our order, and the food is genuinely tasty for what it is."}
{"text":"I have eaten from this place twice.  The first we picked our order up, and the counter staff was extremely friendly, courteous and what a delight!  The food was very good too.  The second time we placed an order, delivery came much quicker than we imagined.  It arrived in about 20 minutes.  The delivery man was super courteous, the food was clean and with the exception of the egg roll...  The food was even better the second time.  The first time I ordered Sesame Chicken, okay but a bit on the chewy side.  The second time, I ordered the curry chicken.   Important NOTE:  Their curry chicken is UTTER Perfection!  I mean A-Ma-ZinG! However their egg rolls are greasy and lack flavor (unless you like the taste of grease and bland cabbage).  Their sweetened iced tea is a bit overpriced for a regular sized drink which they will fill completely up with ice if you don't ask them not to, but it's tasty. The fried rice is not good, It doesn't have any vegetables or anything else.  Its literally fried rice and that is it, but their lo mein is good.    Their prices are about average, and the place looks clean enough.  There is parking in the store front parking lot, and there is a lot of seating if you wanted to dine in."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. I ordered the generals chicken because you really can't mess that up. This place did. The red sauce that covered it was so sugary and gross that it tasted like it came from a can.  There was definitely not any white meat in my dish--only chewy fatty tissue that had some dark meat attached to it. The side of fried rice tasted fine but it didn't have any of the usual carrots or peas in it so it lacked in flavor. I have yet to find a really good Chinese take out in Charlotte."}
{"text":"While I hate nailing a place that has so few reviews, I'm afraid I have to give this place one star.  Some of you might say, \"well, what did you expect from a strip mall Chinese joint?\"  Well, some of the best Chinese food on the West Coast is in a strip mall or even in a bad part of town.  Sadly, this restaurant is not only shabby inside and out, but their food is just as shabby.  Their sauces taste bottled with a one-size fits all sort of technique:  pile on thick, gunky brown sauce on everything and call it Chinese.  Plates that are old and worn.  Dirty glasses.  Shelves that appeared thick with dust.  A faded \"Best of Charlotte\" frame on the wall that dates back to many years ago.   It's sad to see a small business that just doesn't get it.  The food here falls short of the worst  Chinese food in a mall food court. That says it all."}
