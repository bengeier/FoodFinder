{"text":"I don't know why everyone is so negative about this joint. I ordered the Tiger burger combo and it hit the spot! The fries were the perfect cut and fried to perfection"}
{"text":"This place is not fancy by any means, but it is great for these reasons:
One it is open on most holidays
Two the pricing is cheap for delicious schwarmas when your craving them

Three daily specials are a great deal. 
Great for after a night at the drake or Gladstone. 
What you see is what you get here."}
{"text":"The good news is that this place is cheap. Even though the advertised combo was two schawarmas plus two drinks for $6 each or $7.99 ala carte, the proprietor was kind enough to give us two for $5.49 each with no drinks.  
The bad news is that they weren't that great. 
1) We ordered two lamb to go. What we received turned out to be leftover chicken (I must admit, I thought it was a bit odd that rather than slicing meat off of the spit, these were surreptitiously filled from a foil-covered tray where we couldn't see what was being put into them, but I didn't realize until I bit into mine that I had been the victim of a sandwich bait-and-switch.)
2) It wouldn't have mattered if they were lamb, as the main component was a mess of shredded lettuce. There was very little else to the things. Seriously, two measly,  stubby bits of pink turnip. A paper thin slice of tomato. A pinch of parsley. A couple of slivers of pickle. A little cucumber and onion. Mostly lettuce. More lettuce than I cared for.
3) This place doesn't have Babaganoush. 
4) It does sell tabbouleh but it is not offered as a topping option on schawarmas .
5) The so-called hot sauce was pretty bland.
So what we got was essentially two pitas stuffed with iceberg lettuce in a tiny amount of garlic sauce. 

In future, I will spend the extra one or two bucks at one of the innumerable other places (ie Ghazale's, College Falafel, Ali Baba's, Alexandria, etc, etc) that make better sandwiches."}
{"text":"The planet owes the Arabic community a debt of gratitude for blessing us with shawarma and related dishes. With my bold flavour craving in full effect, I went to Hot Shawarma.

The restaurant is mid sized with a bunch of table seating. The odd thing about it is that it's two restaurants combined; Hot Shawarma & Burger Fighter. Not sure why, and I didn't really investigate. It should suffice to say that you can get burgers here as well if you're so compelled.

I chose to get their falafel plate rather than actual shawarma, only because I was passing on meat for the evening. In any case, I'm glad I did because that falafel was boss. The flavour was bold and fresh just like I wanted, and the plate as a whole had a great combination. It comes with various things including, seasoned rice, hummus, picked turnips, and a tomato, onion, iceberg lettuce salad. There are other things, but I'm apparently not cultured enough to recognize them. This is not the best falafel you'll have, but I was super satisfied.

It's hard to go wrong with shawarma restaurants, and Hot Shawarma is no exception. Eat here and appreciate it."}
{"text":"Best shawarma in Toronto!!! The falafel sandwiches are awesome."}
{"text":"Came here after spending a Friday night at Savoy. We talked a lot about shawarmas so we decided to check this place out after seeing their sign.

That $9.99 for 2 shawarma deal is lunch only. Normal price is $6 each. Chicken was meh. And the guy was very stingy with the meat. Not worth it at all. I ordered samousas afterwards (2 for $3.50) and those were meh too.

Cheap? More like a rip off. I have had cheaper and tastier shawarmas before."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Very grumpy service the three times I went.
Its just fine for some quick food, bc of convenience to my home. But I try to avoid it."}
{"text":"Edit: 06/2018
Went there today and I think it's closed for good? Should be open 1pm on a Sunday and it wasn't, and it looked like all the signage was removed. I think it's closed down but haven't flagged it as such since I don't have confirmation.

\"Burger Fighter\":
Set your expectations accordingly, is my take.

If you're in the mood for a gourmet burger with some fancy artisanal sauces, look elsewhere. This won't fit the bill.

If you're in the mood for your basic 'greasy spoon' cheeseburger with a ton of shoestring fries, this will definitely suffice. Sometimes we're all in the mood for that so it's good to have the option available.

I paid $7.99 for their cheeseburger special -- burger, fries, and a canned drink. The veggies, bun, and 'fighter sauce' (ketchup, mustard, mayo, and hot sauce all mixed) were all fine. The 4oz beef patty was pretty greasy and average tasting (didn't taste like it had any special herbs or spices in the mix, and lacked much flavour), while the cheese was your basic processed slice.

If you're in the mood for a simple diner-style cheeseburger, $8+tax is about the best price you'll find along Queen. Would've liked a 6oz patty for that price, but again the area isn't cheap and I basically got the cheapest combo on the menu.

I'd give it a 4/5 if the beef patty was the star of the show -- it's supposed to be the heart of the cheeseburger, and here it wasn't. I won't fault it for being what it is... so it's overall A-OK."}
{"text":"Decent, but basic and bland falafel. Still I've found myself here often enough because it's in my neighbourhood and it's fresh and very clean. It does offer some unusual but welcome toppings such as cucumber slices and green peppers (also hot peppers, olives, and feta). Now that I think about though, I'm not entirely sure why I continue to go here because that's basically where the things I like end. There aren't many side options available and they don't always make the falafel balls to order. 

This place used to be a Mr. Sub and it still very much looks like one. Literally from an interior perspective nothing has changed, in fact it still says \"hot soups\" on the counter. It has a very fast food vibe and lacks the ambiance I'm accustomed to in West Queen West. That said, service is usually nice and quick so it's good if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"The best shawarma I've ever had. Been trying other shawarma places to see how they compare but have yet to find one like this place."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this place! 

The atmosphere could use a little work but man, are their falafels tasty!"}
{"text":"I had lunch today in my 'hood at Hot Shawarma.  I've walked by it a ton of times but have never checked it out. 

The store front looking east is Hot Shawarma.  The store front looking south is Burger Fighter. 
 Same restaurant and same entrance, though.

I ordered the cheeseburger combo special (burger, fries and a can of pop for $7.99 [$9.03 including tax]), though I passed on the cheese.  It was an okay burger, better than I expected.  There was a lot of food for the price."}
{"text":"Customer Service - 1/5
Talking to other people while cashing me out. 

Food - 1.5/5
Fairly average, I prefer Habibi's food over this place. 

Price - .5/5 
Don't really know why it's so pricey. 

I will want to try the burgers since it looked pretty nice but I'd stay away from the shawarma.

Tried the burgers nothing special I rather go to Toma's Burger since the price is basically the same."}
{"text":"This is the the thing I am going to miss most in this little strip of stores when this lot is turned into yet another condo with a bank or dentist office on the ground floor. Some weeks, I will eat at this place for lunch every single day - same thing: chicken shawarma sandwich. It is cheap, the service is very fast, and it gets the job done. Finding inexpensive lunch east of Dufferin is pretty much impossible and I cannot recommend this place enough if you're looking to spend single-digit dollars on a midday meal."}
