{"text":"My husband and I went for lunch this past Saturday. This place is much bigger than Smallman Galley but I prefer the Strip District location since there are so many other businesses in the area. It's generally the same setup as Smallman with the four restaurants plus a bar. I tried the 3-plate taco from El Lugar and thought it was just average. The pork pibil was a little dry but the chicken tinga was nicely seasoned. My husband had The Burger from Provision and he thought it was tasty but not the best burger he's ever had. We will definitely be back to try the other menus."}
{"text":"I love Smallman Galley and really wanted to love Federal Galley. It's a beautiful space, although it's a little hard to get to. Especially on weekends. The issue i have is that the individual spots are fairly pricey for the portions and for the quality. I really hope that they are still working out the kinks in their menus because its a new place. That being said, I would say all the food (we tried 3 out of the 4 places) were severly mediocre. The pizza place was detroit style, similar to the chef at Smallman -- i got 3/4 of the pizza at the same price, less thick and undercooked. The mexican place, i wanted to love. The menu sounded amazing. If you are going to make tortillas from scratch, you better kill it! They unfortunately were subpar and thick. like...very bad. Brisket was dry. Provisions was okay. We got some dippy eggs for my son but the toast was drowning in butter and bacon was super greasy. Perhaps the chefs just need a little time to work out the kinks..."}
{"text":"My wife had the hanger steak at supper and the whole plate was overpriced,poorly presented, and completely unpalatable! The steak was over cooked    
The Brussels sprouts were burnt, and the compote was a spoonful of pur√©ed baby food. The duck fat fries would have been good but they were cold!
I can't believe that I paid $23 dollars plus prepaid tip! The tip is before the whole experience!
And to top it off we kept getting interrupted by the servers trying to deliver us other people's food. The servers seemed to be very confused were the food was supposed to go. The whole experience was sad to say the least. I would expect that a place so new would try and put their best foot forward, but alas, it fell quite short of expectations. I will not be making a trip back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this concept and this space is absolutely beautiful, but I will ding it a few stars for the bartenders. I shouldn't have to ask for my check 3 times, especially on a night where you aren't overly busy. Nor should you be so short with guests when you're asking for their ID's. 

We had two bartenders, and maybe it was an off night, but we didn't enjoy it as much as our trips to Smallman. The drinks were however reasonably priced, especially the beer that was on special for the Founder's Brewery event. And the food is on point, so we'll definitely be back, we just may avoid the cocktails on our next trip."}
{"text":"GROWN UP GOURMET CAFETERIA CULTURE = FABULOUS!

We came to celebrate Mr. Clean Godfather's Birthday! The Rowdy Bunch brought their own Oakmont Birthday cake just in case! Its the hipsters cafeteria concept and it totally works! Pick a table, grab a drink, pick some eats and enjoy! 

We tried things from several kitchens...of note:

Supper: Duck Fat Fries with a spicy pepper aioli! Yes!!!!! These were cut like steak fries fried in duck fat. Very tasty!

El Lugar: Taco plates were what two folks in out party decided on. Very flavorful green chile was of note! I would like to try EVERYTHING on their menu!

Provision: Beautiful craft burgers with fresh ingredients. 

I would love to come back and try more. This place would be great for a game day and then a walk to the stadium to burn some calories!

Loved it! Please stop in - I think you will love it too!
muah"}
{"text":"Similar to the Smallman Galley in the Strip this has a great set up and a little bit of something for everyone. Great happy hour. Not cheap but everything is made fresh so it's worth the price. Can't wait to try brunch here."}
{"text":"Really cool vibe and I like the environment. It's hard to find seating, which is hard if you are planning to eat. A little hard to find, but my first experience there was a really good one. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch this morning and really am a huge fan of the concept.  There is a large seating area around a central bar with four different restaurant options to choose from (my appreciation of how the menus were organized) - classic american, mexican fusion, pizza, and upscale brunch.  You could choose to get small plates from each or stick to one.  I ended up with the buffalo style cauliflower from the classic american and eggs benedict from the upscale brunch, both delicious options.  My only comment about the eggs benedict is they substituted the bread for eggplant, however, I would have opted for a consistency more closely aligned with the starch option.  This aside, the place is great for large groups of people as you individually order your food and pay at the counter.  Great young and fun vibe, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ok, this place feels like I'd imagine Google's cafeteria would be like, plus alcohol. The food selection is great, the restaurants try hard, the atmosphere is lively, the bar staff are friendly and knowledgeable, and I love the beer selection. I haven't tried their patios yet, so I'll update my review when I do."}
{"text":"I tried a couple small items from different places. I always love having a variety of things, instead of having to commit to a big dish that I don't know if I will like. I think the restaurants here are better than the original Smallman galley. One of the mexican restaurants forgot my dessert order and had to be reminded after about 40 minutes of waiting. They corrected/apologized and they were very friendly.
A big seating area and a great bar and would accomodate a big group of friends.
However, we did have an awkward moment while we were eating. As it was late at night and we were sitting by the back exit, a homeless man came in and asked us for money- no management was attentive enough to take care of the situation..."}
{"text":"Had the Michigan & Trumbull Pizza. It was  unique and amazing.  went to the bar had a  nice red wine at a goodprice and viewed a beautiful cocktail selection can't wait to go back to try more. It's such a great concept for start up restraunts  and offers a great selection of food. Makes me happy with it's different style of dinning  in Pittsburgh...."}
{"text":"I have been a respectable patron of this restaurant concept, especially since it's a new, unique local eatery for quite some time, until today. There is a weekly food truck roundup held at the building complex, so my friend and I purchased our food from a truck vendor, then went to Federal Galley for a glass of wine/beer. After we ordered our drink, with our vendor food in hand for nearly 20 minutes, we found a place to sit inside. Within minutes a server approached us and said we are required to leave due to health reasons of outside food being brought in. No problem. I ask her what she suggests we should do since we have drinks that are not allowed to leave the premise and the bartender clearly saw we had food from another vendor & said nothing, she said \"I don't know, but you can't stay here\". She waited until we left our seats; rather embarrassed (to say the least), my friend and I had a few sips of our drinks outside, then noticed the server circling us as well as a few other customers in the same scenario, making us uncomfortable enough to leave. 
I will no longer be a customer due to the disrespectful service and will be sure to let neighbors know of this unprofessionally run establishment. 
In addition, there are dogs allowed on the outer premise of the restaurant, which I think is wonderful, but please don't be hypocrites and state that for 'health' reasons we can't bring outside food in but dogs are allowed to do their business and sit on benches within the confines of the restaurant. There were also numerous employees outside smoking...if you're going to implement standards, please make it universal. 
Please note this is nothing to do with the food vendors inside of the restaurant, just the poorly managed Federal Galley staff."}
{"text":"I live the atmosphere....very casual yet the food and drinks are great.   I really loved the burger I had from one of concepts.   My friend's pizza was really great too!"}
{"text":"Well we finally made it down to try the Michigan&Trumbull Pizza and we couldn't have been happier. The only downside was parking and that was because we didn't know where it actually was. But the garage is close so that was very minor. The pizza was amazing and definitely Detroit style. The atmosphere is very similar to Smallman Galley but I like This one more. We ordered the Farnsworth Funghi, St. Auburn sausage and the waffle fries. The dough was very crispy on the outside but perfect in the middle, the fries were done just right with some delicious seasonings. The ranch was excellent as well that came with the fries. The bar was cool in the middle but the service was less then impressive. The bartender was rude and not helpful. By luckily that won't stop us from going back! Can't wait to try the other chefs creations!"}
{"text":"I popped in here on one of the rare times i was in the north side. 
The space: feels so open and inviting. Much more so than Smallman Galley (even though I LOVE that place). I know they're supposedly all the same square footage but this lay out feels more open concept to me. I went on a rather gloomy day so the outside wasn't really opened or if it was it was too wet for me to be interested in it.
The Bar: they really do the best seasonal and themed cocktail menu in the city, IMO. They bartender was friendly and quick with suggestions and assistance. 
El Lugar: Firs tthe name is great!! (The Place) I am a sucker for anything mexican or mexica inspired. Tacos are my life. I had the beef taco and the pork taco and they were both incredible and flavorful. Definitely a good size, and comparable to all those other \"fancier taco\" joints you may have visited. Their guac and chips was a hearty portion and great snack/appetizer.
Provision: An oldie but goodie! They used to be in the smallman space and we just loved them. HUGE fan of the crispy cauliflower and the bread and butter (seriously! BREAD AND BUTTER IS THE BEST). Their bahn mi is good, but no where near the best i've had. They have pretty solid burgers and they do a burger of the moment which was awesome.
Michigan & Trumball: They have a gluten free pizza that my friend was just DYING about. I thought it was solid but expensive. It's definitively a \"treat yo self\" type of pizza. It's not an everyday pizza. But that's okay.
Supper: i did not get to try yet but am really looking forward to it!!!
Parkin: it's a shit show. Let's be honest. It's never easy to find anywhere to park out there, if you find a good spot... sit tight."}
{"text":"This is the most un-Pittsburgh like restaurant ever, and I do not meant that in a good way.

Back in the 'Burgh for a brief visit from L.A.  Went down to FG to watch the National Championship and to grab some grub.  The food was cold and is still eating at my stomach today.  Beer selection was like it was handpicked from a hipster in Silverlake who makes his own brew from pomegranates.  Not one single, you know, BEER.  Everything infused with bee pollen or angels wings or henna or whatever.  All that I tried tasted just.....off.  I can deal with that, though.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained.  What sucked was that staff was chock full of attitude and rude as can be.  Guy who took my order acted like I was keeping him from posting on his blog, and the man bun bartender guy had more attitude than RuPaul during fashion week.  Every request at tasting this line of unknown brews was greeted with an eye roll and a sigh. 
 Piss off, Snark Man.  Warehouse vide of the place feels like it should be cool, but I found it more cold and cafeteria-like, and on top of everything else, someone kept raising and lowering the light levels like an ADD kid who'd forgotten to take his Ritalin.

Maybe just a bad night?  Possibly.  But I'd suggest skipping this place."}
{"text":"Well, the parking is terrible. I circled the building 5 times before finding a spot! In addition, the service was terrible and my pizza was burnt. For $16.00 and terrible parking, I was better off going to Pizza Hut. What a fail, this is not the place to be!!!"}
{"text":"A group of us had dinner here, with a mixed experience. We tried three of the venues and the bar. I should really say that we only tried two of the venues because the person working at \"Supper\" was so incompetent with no customer focus to the point of being nasty that I walked away. If this review was based purely on \"Supper\" it would have been one star. The bar also was not very customer friendly with a bartender who seems to hate their job. The bartender actually put \"too much\" wine in my friends glass so he poured some of it in the sink. Who does that? Again, one star for bar service. The two other places we tried were very good with interesting vegetarian options and saved the trip. El Lugar served up a delicious plate of vegetarian enchiladas with beans. Provision had an amazing buffalo cauliflower and a veggie Sloppy Joe that was hard to believe did not have meat in it. Both venues served with a smile and an interest in the customer. In short a very uneven experience. Avoid Supper at all costs, go to the bar only if you are desperate for a drink, but an interesting accommodating experience could be had with El Lugar and Provision."}
{"text":"Stopped in at Federal Galley the other weekend while I was in Pittsburgh, and was not disappointed! I had a burger and fries and a beer but unfortunately cannot remember the name of the business that I got it from. There were maybe 5 different food vendors in there and it was a great ambiance. On a Sunday evening was not very easy to find access into the building but still made it work!"}
{"text":"It's like the food court from ur local mall in the 80's, only not depressing and less Aqua net hairspray.

My daughter had the grilled cheese and fries from Provisions, it was okay. The fries tasted like the oil might be old and the grilled cheese was alittle over done. 

I had the flank steak from Supper, and the chocolate cake for desert (my daughter ate most of it). VERY GOOD !!"}
{"text":"I really love this new idea of sharing space to let multiple restaurants co-exist. Federal Galley is another win, like the Smallman Galley, you go up and order and then they bring you your food. We went on a Sunday, so it was not packed. I ordered a chicken sandwich from provision and it was AMAZING. It reminded me of chicken that I had at Pono Market in Kauai (which was my favorite thing ever). My husband got the pizza, it was similar to iron born, but a little more flavorful.

They were out of A LOT of the beers that were supposed to be on tap, which was really annoying, but overall great experience."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Federal! 

Today's visit was part of a work retreat. We arrived around 11:30. The space just opened so it was relatively quiet. Both patios were open and people were seated outside with drinks. My first impression is how large it is. I frequently visit Smallman Galley and anticipated it may resemble the space, but Federal is much larger! It's has the same great tables and menus to give you the same Galley feel. 

The bar is really large and right in the middle of the space. They have over 30 beers on tap and a full cocktail and wine menu. The bartender was excellent providing suggestions and samples for each of us. 

Federal has four restaurants to choose from. Options range from salads, to pizza, burritos, tacos, sandwiches.... you name it. I really enjoyed how many options were available. I think they menus are much larger here compared to Smallman. My coworker and I decided to split a pizza and tacos. We ordered the chorizo pizza. Incredible! I was doubtful I could love another pizza like I do Ironborn, but they are different pizzas for sure. I'm anxious to compared the red pies in the future. My tacos were chicken and beef. The tacos are small so order two at a time. I was happy with both. My favorite being the beef taco. It's not something I imagined I would favor, but extremely flavorful. 

Overall, I was extremely surprised how much I liked it. I really, really love Smallman so I was hesitant to try Federal. While they are similar concepts, both spaces are completely different vibes. I can see myself going to Federal with large groups to enjoy time on the patio this summer. 


My best advice is 1.) to park in the Nova place garage. Street Parking was hard to come by today. 2.) go with friends and try a bit of everything! My coworkers had amazing burgers and sandwiches that I cannot wait to go back and try. They also offer live music and a dog friendly patio."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to Federal Galley. My first time was for a yelp event and decided I definitely needed to come back. I love the idea of having multiple stands to order from all in one place. 
I ordered the huevos rancheros from El Lugar. It was really good. Zero complaints about it. I also ordered a mimosa from the bar. Mmmm. 
My only complaint is Federal Galley is supposed to open at 10am and for some reason on Marathon Sunday they decided to open at 11 but this was not posted anywhere that we could see. There were a ton of us outside waiting to get in. Next time they should just stick to the regular hours. 
Regardless I'm sure I will be back. I need to try the burger!"}
{"text":"Had the pizza from Michigan & Trumbull! My Michigan born husband said is was perfect style pizza. The white pizza was delicious"}
{"text":"The acoustics in this place are terrible. It's so loud and you can hear everyone talking. They need some sound panels or something. The food I got from provisions was mediocre. Meat was good but all the sides were literally cold"}
{"text":"The concept here is so cool-you get to try food from several different restaurants with different styles of food all in 1 huge space. There is a ton of indoor and outdoor seating. We chose to sit outside on the back patio, which has a resort feel with umbrellas, lounge seating and a bar area. We tried food from all 3 of the restaurants-a buffalo chicken pizza, loaded nachos, and burgers and fries. The food was delicious, but super greasy. The cocktails were fabulous. This is the perfect spot to eat before or after a ball game because it's so close to PNC Park, and it's perfect for larger parties. It doesn't quite compare to Smallman Galley, but I'll be back to try more food."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, it has something for everyone. Mexican, Pizza, American, tons of gluten free options, tons of creative veggie options. Whether you want to fatten up or you're into eating healthy, there's plenty of options here. Usually, when a place tries to do this many different varieties of food, they don't get any of them right. But this place is different, they've put 4 restaurants under one roof with a really cool bar to finish it off. There's plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. We visit Pittsburgh often, this will be one of our staples."}
{"text":"Industrial feel.
Young hip and diverse crowd.
Expansive food options.
Visually appealing.
Overpriced drinks.
Little bar seating.
Cafeteria style dining.
Limited TV access, Minimal visibility from bar seats."}
{"text":"Fun place!  Cafeteria feel (not the type you remember) to the place and will be awesome when you can sit outside.  Sometimes can feel a little bit cramped and confusing."}
{"text":"Decent space. Cool concept as Smallman. A bit more mall cafeteria feeling than Smallman though. Busy which is good. Slightly echoey/loud. Tasty mixed concoctions. Good TVs."}
{"text":"Love this place! If you have been to Smallman Galley you know the concept- 4 restaurants, you order cafeteria style and seats are first come first serve. But I like the layout of Federal galley so much better! The bar is an old bank vault located in the middle of the restaurant. It's open on both sides so helps keep with the very open feel. There are several glass garage doors that can be opened in the warmer months. We ordered from Provision (burger), El Lugar (tacos) and Supper (Brussels Sprouts and Poutine). My husband started eating before I could get pics, but everything wonderful. The tacos from El Lugar were my favorite. We will be back to try Michigan and Trumbull. It can be a little overwhelming to decide because everything sounds/looks/smells so good. Just get a drink and enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I had food from El Lugar. Sooooo disappointing. The red chile is more like watered down beans. Eating them one after there is only a little more spice and same base flavor. Torts is inferior to food truck fare and only 1.5x the price. Beer prices are astronomical."}
{"text":"Bad food and service. Overpriced cafeteria at best. Just, No."}
{"text":"Love the concept, space and the restaurants. It's different and exciting. The prices are reasonable and vary in range. The poutine from Supper was delicious. I also tried the BLT sandwich but was slightly disappointed. It didn't meet my expectations of a BLT at all. That won't stop me from coming back!"}
{"text":"Great selection of different foods to try out. It's a great place to go with a group so you can try lots of different things! Nice draft selection too. On a nice day, the patio is perfect and they are dog friendly. Drinking a beer with a dog next to you is the only way to go!"}
{"text":"To those who have been to Smallman in the strip district before, Federal Galley will be a familiar experience. So let's get down to the food... The Packard Pepperoni pizza from Michigan & Trumbull was completely delicious.  I never knew I wanted a spicy honey on my pizza until now. I am hooked. For a detroit style pizza I thought it had the perfect ratio of crust to toppings.

There are so many more options here that I need to try in the future. Will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"Be still my heart.  Having this Place this close is pretty dangerous.  Have been here twice in two days and in terms of space and food selection, I think this tops Smallmans current offerings!  Have been to supper twice and it is stellar (don't let average sounding names fool you), the pizza place, and el lugar which were also good!
Thank you for a wonderful addition to the north side!"}
{"text":"Federal Gallery is awesome! Food is great and there four good food options . Plenty of seating indoor and outdoor. Big Bar is a plus.
We ate at El lugar and Provision Pgh. Both were excellent. Had the Bahn Mi from Provision- yummy and incredible fries. Definitely recommend. Had nacho with many interesting things on them- very good! 
Check both of these places out!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed eating here! 4 different restaurants all in 1 common area along with a bar. 

There are water and glasses at each table. Once you order, you take a number to your table where the server will deliver your food. When you are done eating, they will come take your glasses and dishes from you. You don't have a designated server. Everyone works together. You pay for your meal upfront at the specific restaurant you order at. 

Seems like this place would be busy during the summer months! 

This restaurant is more of a high end cafeteria and is so refreshing than the regular restaurant. Provides an alternative to still going  out to eat but not having to spend an arm and a leg."}
{"text":"Federal Galley is a smash hit. It's everything you love about Smallman Galley, but with a few differences. 

Some of the newly departed chefs from Smallman are here, for example,  Stephen Eldridge and Susan Cope from Provision. 

We had a lot of fun ordering from mainly Provision and Supper. They both featured great vegetarian offerings. 

The bar sure has some excellent craft beer on tap. I had a hard time deciding, but eventually settled on Dairy Potter, an American Double / Imperial Stout style beer brewed by Pizza Boy. 

It's a very engaging dining experience, one that I highly recommend. 

The high ceilings provide an expansive space, while Smallman Galley, especially in the bar area, can feel more cramped. 

We had fun ordering dishes to share. I hope you enjoy your visit as much as we did ours."}
{"text":"Federal Galley is open, and it's here with some fantastic new restaurants and a spectacular Happy Hour!
This is literally across the street from my job, so I was STOKED when I heard about FG opening up! I love Smallman Galley, and Federal Galley is on par with it... It even feels more spacious!
Happy Hour is half off drinks, and who doesn't love that?
I tried Wild Shrimp and Chicken Tinga tacos at El Lugar, which were quite tasty.
I'll be back to try Supper, which I've heard great things about!
This place is the perfect thing to open up in the area... A+ for Federal Galley!"}
{"text":"Would have been a five star but the bartender (male) was very unprofessional. Thankfully the woman bartender took over and she was professional.  The four food selections were delicious. The  people working took the time to explain the ingredients etc and the bus staff cleared the tables quickly and were very friendly. We won't let one bad employee ruin our review! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place left me feeling jazzed--in the best way possible.

Supper: Of the four spaces, this was the most intriguing for vegetarian/vegan fare. I had the falafel and pita with chickpea fries; they did not disappoint! The falafel was perfectly crispy and dusted with za'atar which came with an AMAZING honey and harissa dippy sauce. 

Provision PGH: My husband got the pork chop and, judging by how quickly it was gone, it must've been delectable. He also ordered the bread and butter which was delightfully toasted on the outside, soft and perfectly airy on the inside--witchcraft! 

While I only tried two of the restaurants, I think it might be safe to say the others are pretty dang delicious."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place, having been to smallman a few times before. It has the same kind of vibe, but it's a brighter, more welcoming version.  Great place for big groups, seating style is long farm tables, and the variety of food options would appeal to anyone. Can't wait to check it out with warmer weather, looks like the garage doors open up for almost picnic like outside seating."}
{"text":"Great pizza from Michigan & Trumbull -had special -hot sausage with spicy vodka sauce and pickled chilies-it was fantastic! Best pizza I have ever had. Also tried Crispy cauliflower from Provision-it was good, but not crispy. So many things I would like to try from other restaurants. Will come again!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now- the first time I came for brunch and got pancakes which were amazing.  They were the closest thing to true \"made from scratch by mom\" pancakes I've ever had in a restaurant.  The next time I went, it was for dinner and i had the \"detroit style\" pizza.  I'm generally not a fan of thick crust pizza, but this was an amazing exception.  I've never had any pizza like it- the cheese baked down the sides of the crust was to die for!  I got the white pizza and loved it.  Can't wait to come back and try more of what these different chefs have to offer."}
{"text":"I had been dying to try FG since my super memorable visit to Smallman Galley!! And after one visit I already can't wait to go back!! 

After literally having a dream about the Provision buffalo cauliflower, I knew I had to get it again. It was as wonderful as I remembered, the perfect balance of spice, crunch, and creaminess. My hubby tried their burger and fries. He never makes a big deal about food and wouldn't stop talking about the fries being the most amazing he ever had. I had to agree!! His burger was also very, very good!! The meat crumbled in your mouth which is my favorite kind of burger! 

I also knew I couldn't leave without trying the very Instagrammed MICHIGAN&TRUMBULL. I went with their FARNSWORTH FUNGHI because every single thing on it holds a special place in my food heart. It did not disappoint. It was the perfect pizza. Gooey, salty, crunchy, amazing. It's going to be hard going back and not getting all of the above again!! 

Oh and the beer during happy hour is so cheap!! The one I got was only $3!! $3 for Southern Tier is unheard of!!"}
{"text":"LOVED this place! Highly recommended for brunch. Many food and cocktail options and the outside seating is the best"}
{"text":"Right now I really enjoy the mix of restaurant concepts they have in there. It is a good something for everyone variety. We got a bahn mi and some provision fries from Provision. I would love to come back and try the pizza and tacos as well. The interior has plenty of tables, but gets pretty crowded for happy hour and dinner rush. The nice thing about this place though is that you seat yourself so you usually don't have to wait too long if you're keeping an eye on the tables and which ones might be clearing out soon. My only complaint about this place is that it is LOUD. We were there during happy hour and it was loud, which isn't unusual, but after the crowds died down around 8:30-9 it still seemed really loud in there. It actually was one of the reasons we decided to leave instead of hanging out longer. The ceilings are really high and there isn't really anything soft in there to catch the sound, so it just bounces around all over the place."}
{"text":"This place is really neat and great for the people who can't decide what to order. We went on a Friday night and it was so packed we took our food to go. Bar was very crowded as well. If you want a place to sit I would suggest going on a different night. The pizza place was fabulous and only took about 15 mins to come out. Definitely a great place to check out for dinner or lunch!"}
{"text":"My expectations were SO HIGH! 
Reviews seemed awesome, Instagram kills it on a daily basis with delicious food picture posts.

Then... I finally made it to FG and have to say that I was disappointed. 

The atmosphere is awesome, large open space. And I must say I am looking forward to when the weather breaks and I can bring my pup to the beer garden.

Drinks, were great. Beer was reasonably priced (even more so during happy hour) and I also had a craft cocktail which was tiny yet delicious. Bartender was super sweet as well.

Stop 1 - SUPPER
Poutine was great. Even for a Canadian. (5 Star)
Black bean veggie burger 1 star. I have never had a veggie burger this bad before. The almond queso was terrible. 

Stop 2- MICHIGAN & TRUMBULL
Vernor Vegan pizza... was what my hopes were so high for. The dough and crust, fantastic. Toppings were light and I really was not a fan of this pizza at all. The others look much better on the menu, but due to my diet this is the only one I could eat. Flavor was great but with how thick the dough/crust was there needed to be a little more topping wise - after eating this I just felt like I ate an entire loaf or bread. 

Stop 3- El Lugar
Dessert was fantastic. (TRES LECHES)"}
{"text":"Ooooooo y'all I couldn't be happier that the brilliant minds behind Smallman Galley brought their delightful concept into this beautifully renovated space on the Northside.  I am all about this \"fancy cafeteria\": same delicious lentil fries from Provision that I loved at Smallman so much, yummy tacos from El Lugar, that crispy delicious hot honey and pepperoni pizza from Michigan & Trumbull, and any of the veg-centric dishes from Supper all make it a stand out option for a wide range of palates.  

The bar is located in the old bank vault and has a ton of draft options.  Shout out to the boss ass bar staff, which is always super friendly and helpful even when the place is slammed!  They do great happy hour specials, and I can tell a lot of other folks from the neighborhood or who work near by are taking advantage of the spacious, airy atmosphere with communal tables.  I can't wait for the outside space to open this summer!"}
{"text":"We're big fans of Smallman Galley and we were excited about checking out the North Shore space for Federal Galley. The space itself definitely met our expectations--it was bright, with lots of windows, and a great bar with service on both sides. Lots of tables, including some larger communal table seating similar to Smallman. The place is open and bright with an industrial feel.

We visited Federal Galley on two occasions--once for dinner and once for Sunday brunch.

Our drinks were great. Wonderful beer list and cocktail options, and we enjoyed everything we had from the bar. The one exception is that, during a breakfast trip, the coffee was really disappointing...basically coffee from a big container served in a paper cup, nothing like the amazing coffee they serve at the Smallman Galley location.

We had items from all four restaurants during our two visits.

The pizza at Michigan and Trumbull was probably a highlight in terms of food. The Detroit-style pizza, with a thick and slightly crisp crust, with the St. Aubin toppings (broccoli, sausage, creme-fraiche, and cheese) was excellent. 

El Lugar was more disappointing. Their tacos were not particularly exciting and lacked that great balance between the freshness of toppings and fatty/salty meat that we look for in tacos. 

We'd all had Provision before, when they used to be at the Smallman location. Their best bets remain their burger and their crispy chicken sandwich, which are consistently excellent. Their specials, entrees, and brunch items are sometimes a little more inconsistent. 

Supper was also a little disappointing. During breakfast, they ran out of biscuits or something, so they just brought out the dish with toast instead, but it would have been nice to know that before purchasing. Eggs lacked any seasoning at all and were underdone. Their poutine was good, but their hangar steak dish was, again, underseasoned and weirdly balanced. 

Staff were super friendly and helpful--always scouting tables to see if water carafes need replaced or dishes need cleared."}
{"text":"I've eaten here quite a bit. Supper is my favorite. Everything is cooked perfectly and super delicious. El Lugar is a huge disappointment. Being from San Francisco, where Mexican food is super authentic and delicious, I'm curious how much the owners really know about Latin food. Case in point, I bought dinner and their pound cake w Dulce de Leche for $8 and was highly disappointed. 8$?!? Wow! It was SO small. Literally a whisper of Dulce de Leche. Disappointing. Provision (by the same owners) is a snoozer. Michigan and Trimble is delish is you're in the mood for pizza. The bar is great! Overall it's great."}
{"text":"This place is pretty impressive. Went here on a Friday afternoon and it was pretty busy. It's huge, there's an abundance of outdoor and indoor seating. We had a dog so we found a barrel outside to stand at. The bar is great, they had a ton of draft selections. I think I hit happy hour because two beers and a wine were $11. They had four options as far as food, I chose El Lugar. The food was excellent, I went for the taco plate so I could try a few different types of tacos -- personally my favorite was the chicken over the pork and beef. The staff that were making rounds outside were very nice, clearing plates and bringing water for our dog. Overall a great experience, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I described this place to my partner as a classy mall or school cafeteria. The environment and ambiance here is very minimalist and simple. It's the restaurants that are truly the stars here, at least at the place where I've eaten. I think that's exactly what the creators of this restaurant incubator wanted to do.

Getting to the best part: the food. I've eaten too many burgers to count in my life, but I have to say that \"The Burger\" I ate at Provision PGH was among the best.

That's right. It was one of the best burgers I've ever eaten in my life. And it wasn't until after I got it that I knew it had a cult following.

I asked for it to be cooked medium. It was probably a little under cooked for medium, but it was the best mistake the could've made. The burger itself was filled with flavor, the toppings, with included cheddar, umami aioli, and smoked mushrooms, complemented this masterpiece. The fries I came with were delicious, seasoned with herbs I couldn't quite point out and amazing fry sauce, which I'm guessing has a thousand island dressing base but I'm not 100 percent sure. I may have also dipped my burger in that sauce a few times. It was tasty!

Lastly, the happy hour here is great. The deal is half off drinks from 4 to 6:30 p.m., so on my first visit I was able to get a cocktail for $5, and during the following visit, I got a Victory beer for $3.50. Normally I opt out of getting drinks out, but here I couldn't resist.

My biggest complaint is the location. I found it kind of odd I had to walk around weird concrete buildings. Street parking is the closest option, but it's still at least a five-minute walk to get there, unless there's another parking option I don't know about."}
{"text":"Oh, Federal Galley- how I love thee. 

This is new favorite place in the North Side. It's located in the old Allegheny Center Mall - it features 4 different restaurants in open concept social gathering hall. 

The bar is the middle of the hall - it's literally an old bank vault. How cool is that? They feature amazing local craft brews, soft drinks, mixed drinks, and etc. There is also a counter on both sides where you can order a drink or gather with friends. 

Federal Galley is so neat and clean. I love the simple design and layout. They are getting ready to open up their Bier Garden for the Spring/Summer. The Federal Galley staff as well as the restaurant staff are always so friendly.

It was my mom's first at Federal Galley - so we started with a Woodward White pizza from Michigan & Trumbull. It is simply the best. It is literally my favorite pizza. 

We also ordered the Pulled Pork Nachos from El Lugar - they were very good. It came with pickled onions and jalape√±os - we just took them off because we weren't a fan. The pulled pork & sauce was delicious. I've never had anything like it. 

I'll be back again soon to Federal!"}
{"text":"We really loved Federal Galley! It was slightly hidden, but definitely enjoyable. There were a lot of great food options for almost anything you could want! Loved the atmosphere too"}
{"text":"My fam and I decided to head here for a Friday night dinner. It was very busy, but there's plenty of seating and the food comes out pretty quick. I'm a huge fan of the Federal Galley and Smallman Galley's concept- basically a food court for hardcore foodies. There's something for everyone, and there a tons of GF, vegan, and vegetarian options. All of the restaurants inside are super creative with their food. 

First, I went crazy when I found out that Provision PGH would be at the Federal Galley. I had their food in the past at Smallman, and I was impressed. Of course I ordered there! I had the burger of the moment with a side of fries and dipping sauce. The burger was so juicy and flavorful that I could even eat it plain. The cheese and pork belly on top was excellent. There was also egg salad plus greens with a special sauce on the bottom of the burger. It was extravagant. The fries and dipping sauce ARE ADDICTING. If you're getting a sandwich or burger as your meal, then fries are an absolute must. I'm not much of a french fry or potato person, but these fries are incredible. The lentil fries are UNBELIEVABLE. Also a must have at Provision. Add a fried egg on top and boom you're set!! Thank me later. The pork belly appetizer was delicious too. 

I was highly amazed by the food at Federal Galley. Next time I come here, I'll probably try the taco restaurant or something from Supper!"}
{"text":"Awesome environment!  I would highly recommend it for groups. Beer selection is all local craft, food is quick and delicious. Crowded, but imagine it will be better once outdoor patio is open."}
{"text":"Federal Galley must have problems with underage drinking. IDs required for each beverage purchased, no matter how old your party is. If your mom wants to go to a \"cool happy hour\" for her birthday (Happy 62nd Mom!) and you (in your mid thirties) try to order drinks for both of you, the bartender will go out of his way to make you feel dumb for violating protocol. Mom left her wallet at home, which led to a stupid game of drink-passing. Next time I'll make sure my retiree parents have proof of age, though there won't be a next time soon. There's a way to politely explain policy (that understandably keeps your business legal and operating), and there's an off-puttingly rude way to do it."}
{"text":"I love the design and layout of this location. I got the poutine from Supper and it was amazing! Overall I do enjoy the food at Smallman Galley more than here but they are both great. Can't wait to come here once it gets warmer and they can open the garage doors!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Smallman Galley and I love the concept.  At both of the he galleys in Pgh it has been done super well!!  
Federal Galley is new.  There are 4 great concepts in one spot. It's like an incubator for great new talent. Basically you look at each chefs menu and order what you want. When you pay for it you get a number that you take to the table that you chose and they bring the food to you. Super simple and delicious!!!
The space is verrrrry clean. It's a beautiful space that used to be a bank. The bar is set up where the old safe was - it's pretty cool.  The ceilings are high, creating a very open and urban feel. It's a bright space with tons of light. 
The bar is amazing!  I love the featured drinks. They change periodically. And they have a great beer selection. I've been here for lunch only so far. I got a burge from provision. It was amazing!!!  My lunch mate had the pizza. It looked so good. 
The menus are diverse and if it's like Smallman- sometimes they evolve over time based on feedback.  I'm planning to go again today. It will be hard to pass up the pizza but really there's so many choices.... 
I will say the I love the space but the way the tables are set up and how sparse the space is makes it feel just a bit like a cafeteria. I'll be interested to see how this changes over time."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was horrible. the bartenders allow several men (in our party and outside of) order and walk away with multiple drinks-I watched two men walk away with 8-but they enforced a strict one drink rule with all the women, and weren't very nice about it. Also, upon leaving, my boyfriends tab was lost, or rather never entered. Upon waking up this morning, we find his card was charged 3 separate times. And the prices are astronomical. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Similar to smallman galley, I do appreciate the idea of restaurant incubator, tho my food experience was not as positive as with the smallman galley. I had pizza which was not bad but nothing beyond basic pizza.  I was there on a Friday night which was very busy and the place gets loud making it difficult to have a pleasant social experience. The beer options were pretty good tho with really reasonable prices at the happy hour time.  Definitely a place to consider if you are around there but with an A-/B+ level expectations, at least at busy popular times."}
{"text":"What an awesome place. The variety of food is amazing. The best part about this place is the Bar. Their cocktails are very creative and well thought out. And the beer selection may be one of the bast draft lists in the city. A great mix of local and national breweries."}
{"text":"Supper was superb.  Had the hangar steak and, for desert, the sweet potato souffl√©.  Both excellent. The steak was cooked perfectly and the Brussels pours were a bit sweet but it worked well together."}
{"text":"Definitely my go to place for an easy night out with dinner and drinks. 4 quality food vendors with unique menus that will keep bringing you back to try them all. A bar with spectacular service and a diverse beer selection that caters to beer lovers. You may have to share a table with others, but seating is comfortably close without being cramped."}
{"text":"Federal Galley beats Smallman Galley because: more space, outdoor seating, more parking, better chefs (for now anyway...). FG is in Nova Place. If you can't find street parking, there is a humongous parking garage. The outside patios rock now that the weather is nice. And the walls are a bunch of garage doors so even inside is outside sans the rain and blazing sun!"}
{"text":"Loved the tacos (El Lugar) and pizza (Michigan & Trumbull) I had at Federal Galley! We found a table right away, and the food came out quickly.

I'd definitely come back for both pizza and tacos. I love the concept of these restaurants and while I also really like Smallman Galley, I think the food at Federal is slightly better. I'd be back for happy hour, lunch, or dinner."}
{"text":"love this place.  awesome restaurants and bar and super confident.  looking forward to the summer when the beer garden goes into place."}
{"text":"Neat spot. Seat yourself, it's sorta food court style, but with a bar. The food is \"elevated\" (maybe too much?) as it's a bunch of local chefs trying to make names for themselves. The eating area has great lighting during the day from the huge windows and the architecture is modern industrial... definitely fits the city and makes for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Totally amazing. Just as wonderful as the Smallman Galley. Food was incredible. Had the fried chicken korean BBQ sandwich from Provision....mmmmmmmmmmm.  Service was spot on. Drinks were perfect, Joe is by far one of the best bartenders in the city. The biggest problem here is trying to decide from all the amazing choices. It's a difficult dilemma that you'll have to solve by repeated and frequent visits."}
{"text":"Checked the website for hours.  Arrived at 8:00 for dinner.  They were having a private event with no warning.  They clearly don't respect their customers.  I am never eating here again."}
{"text":"Federal Galley is basically a sophisticated food court with a central bar and four food vendors. It's a massive open space and there are two big outdoor seating areas. We popped in for brunch and it was very busy with a mix of locals and tourists of all ages. You order and pay from the vendor of your choice and they bring the food to you, if you want drinks you order and pay for them at the bar and take them to your table. We did have to wait a little for our food once we had ordered it but when it did arrive we were very happy. We ordered from El Lugar, my husband had a chorizo omelette that came with roasted potatoes and homemade tortillas and I ordered a dish of that was a kind of cross between nachos and chilaquiles made with tomatillos, potatoes and black beans served with a sunny side egg. The portions were large and the prices were good. Federal Galley is I believe the sister business of Smallman Galley in the Strip District. 
It's a great concept and I like that you could go with a group of people and all order a different style of food if you wanted to.  As well as Mexican, there is a pizza shop, a sandwich shop and a casual new American style counter - something for everyone!"}
{"text":"After falling in love with Smallman Galley over the last couple years, I couldn't wait to try Federal Galley! I have been here twice -- once for drinks and a second time for a Yelp event. The environment is totally different from Smallman. Smallman has a tight, busy, gritty feel while Federal Galley is open, airy, industrial, and laid-back.

I really have to applaud the bar. They offer both excellent craft beer and also create amazing cocktails. I am not typically a fan of an Old Fashioned but love the version that they create here. The drinks have really surpassed my expectations!

Finally, regarding the food, I have only had Michigan & Trumbull pizza a couple times. Don't expect Iron Born pizza (like I did) as what they do here is similar yet different. My favorite pizza is the Packard Pepperoni, which is topped with an incredible mix of sweet and spicy, including the pickled chiles and hot honey. Their Teader Fries also shouldn't be missed, which taste like an amazing combination of BBQ chips meet Chick-Fil-A fries.

I am looking forward to returning to Federal Galley in the future and sampling more food from the other restaurants."}
{"text":"The Pittsburgh food universe is a divided set...some love Smallman more...others Federal. I get it...it's a tough call. Me? I have to say, I love Smallman more than Federal and prefer the intimate setting. I can't help it and love how cozy it is! However, they are very different spaces and that is not to say that anything is bad about Federal Galley. My boyfriend loves the open atmosphere and the higher chance of finding a seat with a group of people. I've been there a couple of times but really have only eaten at Michigan and Trumbull and Provision. I don't feel like I need to dote on the pizza, I am sure 99% of these reviews gush over it. The Provision burger though...oh my. Smoked mushrooms and umami mayo, yes please. I really do want to try Supper and El Lugar and really have no excuse for having not. Everything that comes from Supper looks amazingly beautiful. My friend ordered their eggs benedict that uses fried eggplant as the base. It looked insanely pretty and he really enjoyed it.  Overall, it is a great option for food, a wonderful addition to the North Side and a wonderful place for friends to gather."}
{"text":"Awesome place to meet up with friends and grab a drink! Came here for brunch with my friend and I got a BLT from Supper while my friend got ham and eggs from Provision. Both meals were very filling and you definitely get your money's worth! Awesome beer selection and cocktails too. Only reason I give this 4 stars is because it is tricky to find parking and also it was hard to find where I could buy a cup of coffee.. I had to ask multiple people which area of the Federal Galley I could buy a cup"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for a late lunch/early dinner yesterday and were not disappointed! Upon arriving, we parked in the Nova Place parking garage and took the elevator to the Plaza level...once out of the elevator turn left and the restaurant is right there!

There is a great outdoor space and pets are allowed in the patio area...unfortunately with the rain we spent our time inside. The space is huge and provided lots of room for groups. It was also a very family friendly environment...we were both impressed!

We grabbed food at Michigan & Trumbull and Supper and were not disappointed! We shared a pepperoni pizza (amazing), poutine fries (omg you have to get these!!), and the chocolate mousse cake! This was more than enough food to share and we left stuffed! 

For those who have not been to one of these restaurants before....you order at the restaurant window and receive a table number...when the food is ready they bring it over! Despite being busy, our food came out quickly and everyone was very friendly!

In addition to our food we got a few beers at the bar. They have a great selection with 25+ beers on tap as well as mixed drinks. There were also plenty of TVs to watch the game!

Overall we really enjoyed our experience and will be back for more! For those going in a group this is a great place to try a few things and share!"}
{"text":"Welcome Michigan & Trumbull !!  This pizza is as good as it gets also loved the waffle fries and cilantro ranch dressing.  One of the owners Kristen is so accomadating to her customers.  This  is exactly what the area needs.  Try it it is fantastic !!!!"}
{"text":"The food options and environment are outstanding.. I have eaten on two separate occasions at Supper and it is very creative with high quality ingredients.  The type of food offered at all four restaurants exceeds most of what I have experienced at higher end city restaurants.  Well worth the trip to the North Side"}
{"text":"Federal Galley is such a cool space, with even better food! We had the tacos & salad and chips & guac from El Lugar. They were outstanding! The guacamole had goat cheese in it, which was delicious. The bar also has a great happy hour with half off drinks! Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch today for the first time. I have always like the concept of multiple restaurants under one roof.  
I decided to try El Lugar. I order the 3-taco plate with smoked beef, duck carnitas and pork with a side of pinto beans. The entire dish lacked salt, even the home-made corn tortillas and the beans. I was hoping that the Cotija cheese sprinkled on the beans would add some seasoning to the beans. The mere sprinkled of the cheese didn't add any additional seasoning.  The portion was small as well with little condiments served with the dish, just a tiny wedge of lime cut in 1/2 and a few cilantro leaves. 
The taco plate plus a glass bottle (355ml) of Coca-cola cost me $18. I think they can do better than that."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of checking out Federal Galley this past week by attending a yelp event. I've had it on my list of places to try and I was thrilled when I got that opportunity with Yelp. 

The place itself is tucked in behind the Children's museum and it can be a little confusing to find the first time. Upon entering there is a big open space with multiple tables, the 4 dining selection are off to your left, and the bar sits towards the back. I was instantly impressed with the set up of this spot. It was very modern and spacious. 

While waiting for the event to begin we started with some drink samples which we were both very impressed with. They certainly aren't stingy with the alcohol! My personal favorite was the banana old fashioned. I'm a sucker for all things banana and I love a old fashioned. Who knew they could pair together so well?! I would definitely love to come back for their happy hour 4:30-6:30 some day with my coworkers.

While I had the chance to try something from all 4 places, there was one place that really stood out above the rest and that was Michigan & Trumbull. The pizza was so delicious that we ordered a pizza to take home with us. We clearly weren't the only ones with this idea because numerous people got in line to place an order as well. The pizza is seriously out of this world good. The thick dough with the caramelized cheese covering every inch of the pizza. I only tried the white pizza but I'm definitely looking forward to coming back to try the pepperoni."}
{"text":"When I heard that Smallman Galley was going to be expanding and opening a new location called Federal Galley I was so excited and still am because the wait was well worth it. I've only had Michigan & Trumbull but the entire space is wonderful, the bar is great and o Michigan & Trumbull, delicious. I don't think you can go wrong with any of their pizzas, my personal fave though is the Packard Pepperoni. The fries are delicious too, the dipping sauce, ah so good. I will definitely be going back and need to try some other places but will probably still get a pizza on the side regardless :)"}
{"text":"While I love the ambiance and vibe of Federal Galley (the bar is an old bank vault--COOL!), this review is going to be focused on Michigan & Trumbull, one of the awesome concepts currently in residence at Federal Galley.

I am newly obsessed with Detroit-style pizza. Seriously cannot get enough. After trying out the wares at a Yelp Elite event recently, I had to return for more of what Michigan & Trumbull has to offer.

I ordered the St. Aubin Sausage pizza, an order of the Teader Fries, and the Garlic Knots. 

The pizza featured some delicious sausage, broccoli, and red sauce. The crunch of the broccoli brought everything together and the fennel sausage had the perfect amount of spice.

The Teader Fries are out of the world--just like your favorite BBQ chip but better. But the best part is the house made ranch sauce for dipping. I want to bathe in that ranch. I want to top everything that I eat for the rest of my life with that ranch. If I drowned in that ranch I wouldn't even be mad about it.

Finally, the garlic knots. These would be better described as garlic rolls because they are much bigger than other garlic knots I've had. Doused in garlic butter, these garlic knots were out of this world. Perfectly golden brown but incredibly soft in the middle, if I could use one as a pillow at night I would, but in the morning it would be gone due to sleepy munching...

Michigan & Trumbull is fabulous! I'm going to be holding my breath for them to get their own brick and mortar restaurant and then I will live there.

Thank you, Federal Galley, for sharing amazing food with Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"My husband and one of my sons checked this place out over the weekend. It was a great choice!  It's like a food court for foodies and it includes a bar!  We ordered a cheese pizza from the pizza place. It is Detroit style. It had a very thick crust. It was four squares of pizza that was fresh made. The crust is dark and has a crispness. It tasted  like garlic bread. It is covered with cheese and then topped with sauce. It's some of the best pizza I've had. We got Pork Nachos from the Mexican place. It was a HUGE pile of Nachos. There were lots of toppings. The Pork was tender and tasty. I ordered biscuits and gravy as well as duck fat fries from Supper. We inhaled the duck fat fries. Yummm!  If you go you HAVE to try them. They come with a great dipping sauce but I ate them plain. The biscuits and gravy was ok. It had a sweetness to it that I couldn't identify. The gravy was on the thinner side. The biscuit was on the small side and very dense. It was really good. 
We enjoyed the communal sitting and bought drinks from the bar. I talked with one of the young ladies who woks there. She said on Friday nights it is packed. She said that their patrons were more suburban types than hipsters. There were all types of people there including families. 
We can't wait to go back and try more dishes."}
{"text":"Wow, great concept.   I wish I would have thought of it!  My husband and I got dinner at Supper.  I got the sea bass and he got the hanger steak.  Both were very good.  However, we were hungry and should have ordered an appetizer.   We were still hungry after our 50 dollar meal.  We also got cocktails and those were very good, too!  We would definitely go back.   I love what they are doing here."}
{"text":"4 stars for all of these food options under one gleaming sterling roof. Definitely mimicking the kiosk choices at smallman galley. As someone who works in the Northside I'm thrilled to welcome the galley and even more thrilled that they offer lunch hours. Supper had a well rendered sea bass with Brussels and baked grapes. The side of mashed cauliflower was over spiced and could have been better described as cauliflower two ways as most of it was chopped. Additionally I have tried pizza from Trumbulls and was impressed with the inventive pairings like potato and horseradish that is lavished on chewy thick crust. In ambiance, the acoustics are a bit loud so if visiting during high traffic hours be prepared for lots of auditory stimulation... All in all, I am glad to welcome this crew to the nor' side!!"}
{"text":"If you like Smallman Galley in the Strip District, you will love this place.  There are 4 chefs with chalkboard menus to choose from.  The space is really open and has plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.  There are about 25 beers on tap (menu from around the Burgh!!).  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the location.  It is kind of tucked away in the North Shore by the Children's Museum away from most other popular locations."}
{"text":"This is a pretty neat place! Its owners are also the owners of Smallman Galley. It has the same concept of Smallman Galley, where the customer can choose items from different rotating kitchens and eat in a common area (*read as hipster food court, not in a mall)*. The bar is really neat too in that it fitted into the building's old vault, which is fairly noticeable when looking at the padlock door and bulky metal framework around the bar area. Overall, it's a really cool place to visit with a group of people as there is something for everyone!"}
{"text":"I am hesitant to say this as it's already busy enough and I work in Nova Place, but Federal Galley has one of the city's best happy hours.  A superb tap list gets pared down to affordable prices.  If that wasn't enough they stock a great bar and can make the classic cocktails I crave.  Pair all that with several food options (average to good) and you have yourself a great spot.

For the tip if you see me, give me a high-five."}
{"text":"It would absolutely be a five star if they had a better coffee situation. The food is great at all four stalls."}
{"text":"This is the little sibling to Smallman Galley and Smallman set the bar way high. There's something in Federal Galley for everyone. All one really needs is to really fall in love with one of the concepts and I did. I'm an absolute fan of Michigan and Trumbull's Detroit Style Pizza. One time I had the pizza for lunch, took the rest home and ate if for dinner so I'm okay that you can't buy pizza by the slice. The endless seating here makes this place perfect for groups and they don't take reservations. The other concepts didn't blow me away like the pizza but Provision Pittsburgh has pickled beets that are amazing as I don't like beets and they made me a believer. Supper had vegan ice cream that tastes like regular ice cream and I'm calling sorcery. El Lugar's guacamole left a lasting impression on me as I'm a guacamole snob. In summary just go to all the stations and order one thing from each concept and that's a meal."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the happy hour and the food.  As everyone else has said, there are 4 different food places to enjoy.  Will have to make a return visit to try some of the others.  As with the Smallman Galley, the food prices are a little high.  Yes it was busy but our food came out in short order."}
{"text":"My wife did a take out order and I had a hamburger and fries.
I did not go so I can not review the place or the service at this time.
I had a hamburger and fries.
The hamburger was made perfectly and was delicious and the fries as well where delicious.
I would definitely go to the  Federal Galley next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"The newest addition to North Shore and Nova Place, Federal Galley is an incubator for chefs to display their culinary visions to the public. The concept is very unique: stop by any of the restaurants, place your order, pick up an order number, grab a drink from the bar (half off from 4:30-6:30pm daily!), and have a seat. 

Upon entering, you're greeted with the warm glow of Edison lights and a spacious (I mean, really spacious) interior with a modern and rustic vibe. During my first visit, I grabbed a Pandan Express from the bar, a pepperoni Detroit styled pizza from Michigan & Trumbull, and a Tres Leches cake from El Lugar. 

The drink was fantastic, strong, and quite inexpensive during happy hour ($5.50). We were all amazed at just how quickly the food came out. From ordering, it only took about 10 minutes for everyone's food to arrive! The pepperoni pizza was absolutely incredible. The dough in the middle was perfectly fluffy and light and the edges were crispy and lined with delicious caramelized cheese, and the pepperonis crisped and curled up into tiny little pep cups. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! Lastly, the Tres Leches cake was absolutely divine - while it may look dry and dense at first glance, it is anything but. Soaked in dulce du leche and condensed sweetened milk, your taste buds will be enlightened with the strong vanilla notes and melt in your mouth cake texture...I know I'll have dreams about that Tres Leches tonight.

I can't wait to return to Federal Galley and try out everything else the restaurants have to offer - everything on all the menus looks very interesting, and after eyeing up everyone else's food in the Galley, it all looks incredibly delicious. The chefs are incredibly passionate about what they do, and you can tell from the friendliness, the time and effort they put into their food prep, the flavors, and especially the plating."}
{"text":"Great open atmosphere and the outdoor beer garden opens mid-April! Lots of variety to pick from in both food and beer"}
{"text":"I finally got to visit Federal Galley.  After visiting Smallman a few times - I have been anxiously trying to get to Federal Galley since it opened.  

I Love love love the concept restaurants.  It's fantastic.  You can find food for everyone.  

We were able to try food from 3 of the 4 concept restaurants - Michigan & Thumbull, Provision, and Supper, while of course getting some tasty beverages.

The Fungi Pizza from Michigan & Thumbull was SO so good.  I did take off a bit of the arugula on top - but it was still phenomenal.  The pork belly w/Kimchi from Provision was my favorite dish.  The kimchi had more of a bbq flavor than spice - but was so so so good.  The food at Supper was good - but my friend and i both felt it needed something else.  My bite of meat in the poutine was all fat.  Kind of disappointing.

Anyways - I have a feeling this will turn into a frequent stop.  It's so easy to try and so so good."}
{"text":"Noise level on a scale of 1-10; a 12.  Was like eating at an Oakland Pitt student hangout on a Friday night. Cafeteria seating with restaurant prices."}
{"text":"So happy we tried a new spot! The concept is confusing for a quick minute when you walk in, but you figure it out quite quickly. Take a walk around and see all the options then go back to what caught your eye. There are SO many seating options, walk around, you will for sure find somewhere. We came during the dinner rush on Saturday night and still found quite the perfect spot to sit and eat. The nice man even turned on the Pens game for us! You do need to go to the bar and get your own drinks, but there's water on all the tables. There are seriously so many drink options, you will be happy! 
We decided to go with the pizza, Michigan & Trumbull. We shared the arugula salad first... It was crispy and refreshing, a little tangy dressing, but nicely balanced. I had the vegan pizza, it was so yummy. The crust is soft with a nice crunch too! It had roasted eggplant, super delicious. The pizza had a nice spice to it, I'm not sure if it was the walnut pur√©e drizzle or the red pepper flakes. I did ask for pickled onion in addition, and it came without, kinda sad, but still scrumptious. Either way, yes yes yes, I want it again! The cilantro finish was a nice addition, but maybe just a little too much cilantro for my taste. My husband had the chorizo pie, he also loved it! He opted out of the pickled red onions on it, but to me it sounds like it would have paired perfectly. The pizza had a nice little ranch drizzle, he had no complaints! 
The pizza did take about 45-50 minutes, but it was totally worth the wait. Everyone is SO incredibly friendly and helpful. I look forward to coming back again!"}
{"text":"To say that I'm excited about Federal Galley being open would be an understatement. It's about 3 feet from my apartment building and more convenient than I ever thought possible. I went with a group of friends and we ended up trying something from all of the four concept restaurants. It was easy to order and they give you a number to put on your table and then bring the food over to you when it's ready. The happy hour is also a fantastic deal considering it's 50% off beer, wine, and liquor from 4:30-6:30 every week day. Everything we ate was fantastic and I will most definitely be back again. 
I had a Detroit style pizza from Michigan & Trumbull. It was delicious and the perfect size for one person. Not too big and not too small. For dessert we shared the tres leches cake from El Lugar, and wow. I think I have a new favorite dessert. If you haven't tried this yet, you definitely should."}
{"text":"This is a very cool idea for an eatery. There are multiple places with different cuisines, so everyone has the opportunity to eat what they like. It was quite busy when we went, though I was told it is always that way. Luckily, we were able to find seats without much issue. 

I ordered a taco plate with veggie and stewed potato tacos. Both was pretty good. I shared the beans and salad with my brother who also go the taco plate. The salad was a little salty. The beans were standard. Everyone else also seemed to enjoy their meals. 

I suggest trying the bloody mary if you like them. This one was the perfect amount of horseradish with not a huge amount of tomato juice. Quite delicious. 

I love that they provide water to everyone. Every time a water jug was emptied, another would appear at the table. It was like magic. The people who work at Federal Galley are so attentive and fabulous at their jobs."}
{"text":"Great addition to the North side and compliment to its sister, Smallman galley. I tend to like this space a bit more due to more seating, and seemingly bigger menus from each restaurant, I'm assuming due to bigger kitchen spaces. They also have a great Happy Hour! Half off their cocktail list and draft beers I believe (It's good, trust me) It's perfect for any type of group since there are so many options for food/drinks/desserts. Everyone will find something they like. My pro tip would be to get a pizza and add the hot honey drizzle. So good. Also the brownie sundae with the chips on top from the taco place, amazing."}
{"text":"Was here during the middle of the day with a friend and the whole place was empty. Giving it 3 stars because I wouldn't come back if I knew it would be so empty. People can usually make or break a venue.

Drink selection was great and for food there were many options, even for vegetarians!

Probably wouldn't go back because it's out of my way and over priced lMO.

Overall, nice atmosphere, decent food. I'd like to see it when ya crowded if I ever find myself back here."}
{"text":"The food was all truly excellent especially the pork belly! Really fantastic. The atmosphere was fun and energetic and the service was also excellent. Highly recommend for something different and delicious!"}
{"text":"Federal Galley in Nova Place is an awesome spot to try all different types of cuisine.  It has a lot of open seating and a fully stocked bar."}
{"text":"It's opening day at Federal Galley and the place is already booming. The concept is similar in some ways to its sister establishment Smallman Galley but also different in its own way.

I got to meet with the general manager Geoff Zak who explained the concept and was very attentive to my needs. The Federal Galley works with established chefs as opposed to student chefs over at Smallman Galley. These chefs are not term limited and can renew their lease as often as they wish.

Set up right behind Nova Place in what used to be a former PNC bank building, \"the vault\" is used for the bar area. Happy hour starts at 4:30 and runs until 6:30. The bar hosts 25 craft beers,a Philippine inspired cocktail menu, and wine. Free WiFi is available here.

Let's meet the current chefs. First up is Provision Pittsburgh and El Lugar which is run by Stephen Eldrige and Susan Cope. Although this is the same Provision Pittsburgh that was part of the first \"class\" at Smallman Galley, Stephen told me that the menu has now completely changed and they are offering more sandwiches for lunch. From his love of the southwest he also runs El Lugar a Mexican concept using PA farm cheeses and other farm to table ingredients in his diverse menu.

I then got to chat with Kristen Calverley and Nate Peck, the main chefs at Michigan and Trumbull which specializes in Detroit style pizza but not the same as Iron Born over at Smallman. They also have a vegan pizza and eventually plan to go gluten free. Last, I had the opportunity to meet and chat with Vincent Perri from Supper.  His specialties are vegan and gluten free but regular meat items are on the menu as well. He told me he eventually wants to do catering. I saw all the restaurants had healthy options to their menus.

I decided eat from \"Supper\" I ordered a black bean veggie burger on a potato roll and a side of Brussel sprouts that included baked grapes and spicy pecans. Like Smallman Galley you are give a number to take to your table and can sit at any of the long tables with water bottles. I did ask Geoff about beverages and while the chefs offer their own beverages, there is no ice tea. There is no coffee place set up but they eventually hope to get a coffee bar.

I got my meal fairly quickly. The veggie burger was cooked to perfection but very messy!! Glad they have plenty of napkins! The Brussel sprouts were out of this world good. I was glancing at some of the other meals and yes take out is available. Everything looked so good!!!

I wanted to get a chocolate chip specialty cookie from Provision but time and my full stomach wouldn't allow it. I'm happy for this new concept and am looking forward to returning. Parking may be a bit of a problem since you are limited to street parking and the pay garage under Nova Place. Federal Galley also sits in front of the Children's Museum. They are open 7 days a week and offer brunch on Sunday"}
{"text":"Duck fat fries and garden pea falafel from supper.  Preferred falafel to the fries (I don't usually like thick cut fries but good -we were sharing otherwise doubt I'd gone for these). 

cauliflower first from provision. 
The cauliflower was amazing. I love buffalo wings and cauliflower so perfect combo for me. Def would order this again. 

Also ordered chopped salad from el Lugar.  Good salad."}
{"text":"This is worth your time. There are 4 kitchens in the place. We went to Provisions and El Lugar. Chef Steve and Chef Brian with their outstanding crew have continued formula for great food they started at the Smallman Galley in the Strip. 

We had the burger from Provisions, one of the best you will get in the greater Pittsburgh area. Make sure you get the fries with this.

From El Lugar we ordered a Seafood Cocktail. The octopus was tender and the tuna perfect. We also had a taste of the house made biscuits in gravy hollandaise sauce, incredible.

The creativity they offer will have us coming back. Our next trip we will try the other 2 kitchens.

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great concept and a great space! I am a big fan of Smallman Galley but I get a little claustrophobic in there, so this really worked for me. I recommend going on a sunny day and eating on their patio."}
{"text":"Ahhh, the long awaited Federal Galley! This is in my 'hood and I was so excited to finally have it open last week. I ended up grabbing a couple of tacos from 'El Lugar'. I had the Pork Pibil and the Shrimp with kimchi. I have to say, I wasn't really a fan of either. Both tacos were dry and the pork could have used jalape√±os or something. I will give the other concepts a try! Looking forward to Michigan and Trumbull next time...

I did have the most amazing winter old fashioned, however. It had a banana-y taste but very mild, not fruity or anything. Will be going back for a few more of those! Other than that, the ambiance is great and it's so much more spacious than Smallman. A spot I'll probably frequent often!"}
{"text":"Another great spot to come from the Galley concept. Four exceptional restaurants that can't be missed.
I'm overwhelmed by the flavors and talent coming from these chefs.
I really like all of them but have to be honest and say that Supper and Michigan & Trumble are my favorites. That's not to slight Provisions or El Lugar at all. In fact El Lugar has exceptional sauces and Provisions knows how to make a beet taste incredible.
The bar comes with really yummy and original takes on classic cocktails as well as their own.
Great layout and decor.
Fantastic staff.
Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've followed the Galley group from the beginning. Smallman was such an exciting concept, I was pumped to see Federal opening up in the North Side. Even more exciting, was that Provision was joining them, a former Smallman Galley fave (best burger in Pittsburgh maybe!).

I like this venue better than Smallman because it definitely feels more spacious, although I hear it's the same size, just different dimensions. The bar is nice and accessible though! I think their bar program might be one of the most interesting in the city, they always go with a fun seasonal cocktail theme and have a phenomenal local beer list. 

I wanted to wait to write a review until I ate at each of the restaurants to do a fair assessment. There are four kinds. First I had El Lugar, which is delicious Mexican. I've had a nacho dish and pork enchiladas, which are a hearty helping, I might add. Supper is a great modern American concept that offers a variety of indulgent and healthy foods. I like that they have a lot of gluten free options for me.  The heirloom spinach and veggies is listed as a snack, but it's a hearty helping too, and could totally be a full dish. The strawberry vinaigrette put it over the edge of tastiness. But I had to even it out with the delicious poutine (also GF!). The fries were crispy, which is good when paired with gravy. 

Finally, I'm so happy to report Michigan and Trumball has gluten free pizza. I was so sad to not be able to eat anything from there that when they started offering, I was first in line! That crispy cheesy crust is no joke. You could offer me a side of that and I'd be good. But the pizza itself is great. I had to double check it was GF because it tasted like normal delicious thick pizza crust. I just tried the spicy sausage pizza with pickled onions and that had to be some of the best toppings I've had on pizza. 

I will note, parking can be difficult depending on the time of day. During workday hours, I usually just try to find parking on street. The NOVA place garage can be dicey. After hours you should be fine with the garage, but it's confusing to navigate how to get to Federal Galley from the inside. Other than that, I can't wait to sit outside in their newly opened patio during the warmer months, it is going to be killer!"}
{"text":"Getting here was a little bit of a mess. The address listed here is different than google and is different from the address listed on the receipt... So after wandering around finally found it. So that was not fun...

Once I got inside, it was packed as it should be on a Friday night. Didn't even make it to the bar because the crowd was so dense around it and not moving. That kinda sucked.

The food was good. A little expensive for the portions but still good.

Will try again but definitely not worth all the hype..."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and was happy to see a few of the places had vegan options for breakfast that weren't just your standard oatmeal or a bagel. I had the tofu quinoa scramble from Supper and it was yummy and filling. My only complaint was that figuring out where to get coffee was a little tricky (hint: you have to go to the bar)."}
{"text":"Excellent space set up for differing tastes. Went there for Sunday brunch and had some amazing food from el lugar and provision. Food at both places was amazing and tasty. Chorizo omelette and potatoes was bomb. Coffee at the bar was excellent . Draft list was solid and amazing choices for all."}
{"text":"The space is great for any group. The food choices were very good and the quality was even better. Beer and drink list was impressive too."}
