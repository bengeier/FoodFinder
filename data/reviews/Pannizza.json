{"text":"Food doesn't taste that good and they never let you use coupons. They always say they are new and do not know how to put a coupon. Maybe it's my bad luck. Anyways, If you are a student and wants pizza go to the pizza place next door where they give 10% off for regular ones and more if you are an engineering student."}
{"text":"I am embarrassed to admit how many times I have eaten here. The first time, I tried the Mardi Gras Panini, which was a fusion of seemingly odd things that somehow came together to create a delightful explosion of flavor. For my next visit, I tried a pizza and became hopelessly addicted. I never expected to get such a good pizza from a place like this. I was quite impressed with the quality and variety of toppings. Also, the staff members are always very friendly, and the Manager (I think that's who he is), always has a smile on his face. 

I may soon have to ask to be banned from this place. If I keep eating here as often as I have been, then by summer, I'm going to be jiggling all over the place."}
{"text":"We were walking and decided to try the Canadian Poutine that everybody talks about. 
The location is central, next to the university.
Similar to a fast food but there's alcohol, the restaurant was clean and the girls working were great. 
It was my first time trying and I was not disappointed, the fries were crispy and the toppings were fresh! 
It was delicious, I'm glad I tried it here first"}
{"text":"Try the Burger sandwich! It is super yummy
One sandwich seemed not enough though. I might have been too hungry or that they need to think of bigger products 
The price is fair (about 8 dollar) i say
They also have pizzas ( the name of the business suggests so!) and by looking at the ingredients and the way the pizzas are prepared I can fairly be sure they too are good for a try
Finally the location of this specific branch is so suitable for McGill students who want to prevent starvation between morning to night long lectures!
I forgot to comment on staff: they are so nice smiling and helpful"}
{"text":"Casual pizza place right across McGill. It's very convenient for McGill students. You can get unlimited toppings. The pizzas are small but filling for one person."}
{"text":"Superbe place downtown if you are craving pizza and are really hungry and don't have anyone to share it with. The size of the pizzas is enough for a meal and a half if you are not too hungry. I always take the choice with unlimited toppings, because I feel like the other ones are not as worth it; might as well get a slice at the pizzeria next door for half the price. And by unlimited, I REALLY mean unlimited. This specific location is very generous with their ingredients; I have been to another location and they were reaaaally cheap with the quantity and looked irritated when I continued listing more ingredients that I wanted. I often take 5 different meat, 6 different vegetables, and 2 different cheese on my pizza and never got a judging look.

The staff is mainly composed of young employees (probably students) who are very nice. The reasons why I'm giving it a 4 is the sometimes questionable hygiene between handling the pizza and the money, and the price. The price is relatively high for a fast food pizza store. This is the main reason why I don't go there as much as I would even if it is so close to McGill and there is not much else around."}
{"text":"Great service and really friendly staff. Super close to McGill, good prices and tasty pizza."}
{"text":"So tasty! They have gluten free crusts and really take the time to clean and lower the chances of cross-contamination."}
{"text":"Oh Poutine. Not only is this located in a great part of Montreal near MCGill campus, but it is a true poutine with crispy golden fries, a light gravy, salty curds, and added toppings of your choice. The BBQ pork with bacon was a perfect pairing. The restaurant (if you can call a small kitchen and a counter place orders a restaurant) was clean and the cook was very friendly. There's 3 bar stools inside to sit making this primarily a grab and go style. Even though poutini is traditionally a late night drunken food, 
Pannizza is made with such a great quality that it can be fully enjoyed with no libations necessary."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza, and friendly service! Panizza is conveniently close to McGill campus if you find yourself craving pizza."}
{"text":"The food was good. The choices were nice because they had non-dairy cheese and gluten free crust. The cons: one worker there and he wore the same gloves to make our pizza as he did to take the money. He took a long time taking our money because we had no Canadian dollars and his credit card machine wasn't working. Then, we went back to make someone's pizza while our transaction went through. Eww. I am glad the pizza went through the oven so it will kill any germs from the money. But, we took so long with the next customers that my friend and I were done eating BEFORE the group of guys paid and sat down!!! And my friend and I were kinda annoyed because the guy didn't tell her that he was charging her for my meal, and she didn't realize it until it was done. So, we hate owing each other money. Not happy that he didn't tell us. So, the tasty pizza made this place a success!!! 

I suggest: add a second worker and PLEASE switch gloves to take money!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok pizza, once really really good some other time not. Should be more consistent, I know they can be good. 
I am disappointed tho, that we have 2016 
and this pizzeria doesn't have gluten free pizza dough yet. That's a shame! 

Mozarella basil tomato cheese arugula would be a kickass topping for a GF option! New York has it, Montreal should too! 
Trust me! :) 
Very nice staff!"}
{"text":"Basically the only decent fast food around McGill, apart from smart burger. Med oizza is my personal fave. If you're at McLennan and want a quick bite, just head over here and then backtrack to McGill's most depressing library."}
{"text":"As someone who suffers from a lot of food sensitivity, it's difficult for me to find good food which sits well in my stomach. Their gluten free cheese pizza did just that - delicious, warm, and sat well in my stomach."}
{"text":"Loved the gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free pizzas!  Very responsive to accommodating our food allergies.  We customized our own pizzas and they were all delicious. Great customer service.

They also made a regular pizza for a member of our party with peanut and tree nut allergies and were very thoughtful about cross-contamination.

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!! If you're in the mood for pizza then check this place out. The crust on our pizza was crunchy and perfect and we got a mix of the spicy and regular sauce. One of the best pizzas I've had while traveling. The place is cool and great for people watching. Cleanly and good service."}
{"text":"Despite the fact that I had already had a slice of pizza that very day, I could not resist trying their pizza once I saw they were open and so welcoming as I walked up the stairs off Sherbrooke St. West. 

I remember the place as a Booster Juice location and those stairs, but the place does not look anything like it's former juice bar self. The colours are mush more appropriate, shades of grey and white walls with dark brown wooden chairs. 

I will add more about the pizza which I downed to the last crumbs soon, but since the dog needs a walk, I will simply say I don't usually give a place 5 stars on the first visit or without tasting several items, but the quality, service and ambiance of this well organized and airy space was right on. I took a chance on pizza with pesto sauce and was pleasantly surprised at it's well balanced moisture of toppings to crunch-of-the-crust ratio. 

It obvious they are not trying to be a gourmet pizza place and that's fine, because for quick serve (and they are very overt about it taking 2 minutes and fifteen seconds to bake your pizza or panini) it should prove to be a welcome addition to the many dining option in the downtown core - especially for McGill's staff and students, as it's a stones throw from the main campus gates.

I'll be back to try more, especially while their opening special is on. Check back for an update on dessert pizzas and more."}
{"text":"Had dinner here while staying at L'Appartement Hotel. Loved the concept of creating your own pizza that's ready in 2 minutes 15 seconds. We got the margherita pizza which was delicious. Enjoyed the casual atmosphere. I can see how this would be a favorite for college students."}
{"text":"Pannizza is just down the street from where I live, so I've been there a good number of times. It opened not so long ago, but it already seems to be doing really well. The owner, Eric, is an extremely nice guy, and the staff in general are very friendly. The service is very good, the food is ready quite quick (2:15 minutes to be exact, as is their slogan). 

The menu at Pannizza is pretty extensive. There is a set menu, and it's also possible to build your own pizza/pannini. There are a lot of options in terms of the meats/vegetables you can put on the pizza, and the staff are more than willing to help with the selection process. The great thing is, there's no added cost for making your own, and you can put as many toppings as your stomach desires. It's not an expensive place - about $10 for a pizza and $7 for a panini. 

The first time I went, I tried the Med pizza (pesto sauce, seasoned chicken and a bunch of vegetables). The pesto sauce was a pleasant inclusion on the pizza. I've never tried pesto on a pizza before, and I have to say, it's really worth it. Other times I've made my own pizzas or had the Nonna (meatballs). 

I've tried the Panini once, and it was toasted to perfection. The only issue I had with it was that it wasn't filling enough :( The dessert pizzas aren't bad either, but they can be a bit too sweet (or maybe it's just me!). 

I'm definitely going to keep going back to Pannizza as long as I live in the area. It's a great place to swing by if I want to grab a quick meal, and it's even good to sit down with friends over a scrumptious lunch."}
{"text":"I found myself really craving pizza this evening and this was the closest place. The reviews were pretty good, so I decided to give it a try. 

The inside is pretty small, but it's nice. It also seemed to be fairly clean. The employee serving me was beyond nice and accommodating. Actually, the service in general was great. For those with allergies and restrictions, they have gluten-free crust and non-dairy (daiya) cheese, so there's something for most (if not all) people. I even noticed that they're careful about cross contamination (i.e. making sure they use a different cutter for the gluten-free pizzas), which is awesome. 

Unfortunately, my pizza wasn't that great. In my opinion, the gluten-free crust just didn't taste good whatsoever. Moreover, I found myself feeling extremely ill about 30 minutes after finishing. Needless to say, I'll be a bit turned off from pizza for awhile. With that said, I've heard good things about the regular crust, so maybe that's the way to go if you don't have an allergy."}
{"text":"It's a good place near McGill. The portion for pizza is enough for one person and it tastes great."}
