{"text":"Its Jenny is a great new cafe!
You have a variety of appetizing baked goods to choose from. There are also vegan and gluten free goods as well! And also a plus, unlike other cafes, they are inexpensive. Its Jenny is also a great cafe to stop by for a quick bite as they have sandwiches, wraps, and paninis.
The decor of the cafe is a simple, casual looking coffee shop with a comfortable, relaxing atmosphere.
Their coffee is also freshly brewed and tastes awesome!"}
{"text":"It's Jenny is one of my favourite coffee shops and snack go-to's. Their service is always exceptional, run by a family, and their food is top notch. I really enjoy their baked goods, as well I did have a lovely cappucino the last time I was there. Not only is their service and food delicious, but their store has such a calm, cozy vibe. I love sitting by their front window, having great discussions with friends and enjoying my meal. Great atmosphere, great food and great service. Thank you!"}
{"text":"It's a cute little cafe that is family owned and operated. Very friendly and personable service. Have come here many times especially when I used to frequent the Cabbagetown/Ryerson area more regularly. Great little spot to quickly pick up an americano and cookie to-go, or to sit down for a nice little breakfast/lunch while studying or chatting with a friend.

Food:
Jenny is actually a fantastic cook/baker - she really knows how to make the right flavours come together in her food. 
Pastries are on display; they also have breakfast and lunch options (i.e., made-to-order breakfast plates, sandwiches, salads, chili, soups). They even have jap chae!! (Bet you don't often see that on other cafe menus)
Lots of organic/vegan/gluten-free options available.

Beverages:
They use an espresso blend exclusive to their cafe, which is SO. GOOD. 
They also make their own almond milk in-house; great to add into americanos. Was ADDICTED to this.
Nice tea selection.

Other pros:
- Free wi-fi. 
- Electrical wall outlets available
- Lots of books that you can read. 
- Good natural lighting.
- Sufficient seating space.
- Friendly service.
- Clean washrooms. 
- Walking distance from R.U.
- Not too loud"}
{"text":"Nothing special as far as breakfast is concerned, there are many better options in the area. The portions are tiny, and aside from people getting coffee to go, the place seems to be always empty."}
{"text":"Nice to have another good lunch option and cafe in the area. The decor is nice, and a reasonably big space allows you to sit down and have lunch. The tuna wrap was great and the cappuccino competes with Jet fuel coffee just up the street. Looking forward to trying the Chili soon."}
{"text":"I purchased a delicious cup of Earl Grey tea from a delightfully cute elderly couple ( I believe they are the owners). They were attentive and sparked a conversation about the weather. The only thing unpleasant about this interaction was the price of the product. At $3 for a cup of tea, it was a little more steep ( pun intended) of a price I'd pay for a cup of Earl Grey. All in all a good visit, however I would only go back if I was feeling a bit more wealthy."}
{"text":"A cute little spot in a rougher area. Their outside signage offers up vegan fare, so much, that I thought their meat options on the menu were faux meat. But they do offer meat and veggie options A little light on the veggie. They have espresso coffee only. I found mine a bit weak  but still had a nice flavour. The atmosphere is zen-like with white walls, lower light levels and very quiet Jazz in the background. It's so nice on this rainy day that I'm here. I will definitely be back. Actually, as I'm continuing to drink my coffee it's actually stronger. Perhaps the top was just weaker. Also a plus, they have real mugs for stay-in customers."}
{"text":"The staff at Jenny are always extra friendly and inviting. On top of that, the coffee and food keep me coming back again and again, whenever I'm in the area.

Everything is just well executed in the food department. They have some classic cafe sandwiches as well as unique options like the tasty chili (highly recommended).

The espresso is made with care and has a nice sweet, mellow finish to it that is missing at some other cafes in the area.

The house-made almond milk makes for fantastic tea lattes!"}
{"text":"Wonderful coffee, the best I had in the neighborhood. Especially homemade almond milk latte! Delicious!"}
{"text":"It's so good! 

Come to Jenny's for breakfast or lunch, socialize, study, or takeout. 
Not your place for dinner, huge groups dining in,  or people-watching. 

Jenny's hits the following on my happy list:

Fast 
Fresh
Delicious 
Great value
Family owned and operated 

Pretty space with lots of natural light 
Books to read if you're just chillin'
Interesting art on the walls
Peaceful music 

Breakfast 
Lunch - soups, salads, sandwiches, homemade chili... 
Good variety of choices from light and healthy to heavy and hearty

Excellent espresso and espresso based drinks
Quality tea 

Vegan options savory or sweet
Gluten - free options for the same

Excellent service 

Wi-Fi 
Not noisy 



My suggestions would be to make the seating even more comfortable:
Cushions on the chairs or maybe one small bench/booth for lunch dates

And a couple plated non sandwich/ soup/salad entree options 

I can't believe I haven't hit up this hidden gem literally  down the street from me more often!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing, neither the coffee nor the food were good. Came here based on the good yelp ratings but found nothing to like. The place has been sold to new owners so that may explain something. Certainly not going there again. Giving them two stars just coz the interior is sort of cute."}
{"text":"LOVE Jenny's!! I come here about 2-3 times a week. 

Their sandwiches are great. My fave is the avocado panini soooo goood!!
Also, their spicy ramen is the best ramen I have ever had!!! (it's pretty spicy for those who are sensitive to spice) 
Everything I've had so far was great and healthy!
Run by a cute couple that are so friendly :)"}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop with friendly owners. Drinks are standard priced and seating area is cozy. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Homemade food by a Korean couple, they serve everything from breakfast sandwiches to Korean food. The menu consists mostly of vegetarian and vegan options (you can add meat) + even the desserts (also gluten-free)! Me and my coworkers mostly get the Bibimbop and the Spicy Tofu Soup. This is a no-brainer go to place for lunch!"}
{"text":"I've tried almost every item at Jenny's... The food and drinks are all incredible! They atmosphere is nice and the food is really fresh and healthy... Filling but never heavy feeling. The ramen is a tad spicy so be careful if you're sensitive to spicy things. If you have time to wait the omelettes here are also very good. Oh and her mocha lattes are to die for !!!"}
{"text":"Glad to see that even though Mylk Uncookies is gone, there is still a great cafe here. \"Jenny' wasn't working when I stopped by, but it was a lovely older couple who seemed to tag team between the cash and the kitchen. It was quiet on a weekday morning and they brought out my cappuchino and sandwich to me. I had the egg white sandwich which certainly didn't skimp on the eggs, and had harvati cheese and arugula on toast. Simple and healthy. The cappuccino was solid. They have lots of loose leaf teas, tea lattes, etc. as well. 
The decor is mostly the same as before (robin's egg blue walls, bright white furniture) but there is a bookshelf with books, games, and random plush animals (?) now. It doesn't really match, but oh well. 
Only thing I would change is better music selection. I sat there for an hour reading and the teeny-bopper music (think Taio Cruz, Selena Gomez) was not so inspiring."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!! finally found a neighborhood coffee shop that serves amazing food in the perfect atmosphere! I've had their bulgogi sandwich and it's bomb! Almond tea is delicious. Wifi has strong signal it's a perfect place to come if you want to get some work done or just catching up with friends. The service is awesome."}
{"text":"It's Jenny is the new Mylk Uncookies. Literally. 

Currently, it still looks just like Mylk Uncookies with the light blue, white and big bright lights, but Jenny is serving up the cheap eats and also does catering. I don't think MU could survive the Cabbagetown culture, but Jenny seems to understand lunch options are the key to success. I'm about to go and indulge in her chili creation. Like, right now. 

Her menu is a cornucopia of healthy soups and sandwiches, and apparently she caters out these decent, delicious eats. She is also the sweetest woman ever. Gotta love Jenny. I hope this place is around for a good long while. 

PEPPER POINTS: For her very reliable free Wifi and green tea selection. Pepper Props even.
