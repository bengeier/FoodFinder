{"text":"First experience was great. Warm croissants, delicious multigrain baguette. But since then, not so amazing.  The baguettes are the star of the show here. And considering Le Matin opens at 8am, they sure have a lot of trouble having the (baked off-site) baguettes delivered in the \"matin\". Apparently they are \"usually\" in by 11am, but during a recent visit at 11:30am, the baguettes were MIA with no ETA.   I'll stick with Brick Street when my morning needs some fresh-baked bread."}

{"text":"This neighborhood gem is tucked around the corner just off of Queen.  The staff is friendly and welcoming.  I've only ever had the baguettes but they're quite tasty and sometimes still warm from the oven."}
{"text":"Le Matin is tucked away on a side street of Queen.  I only noticed it when walking back to my car after having nabbed a few macarons from Bobbette & Belle in the spirit of Macaron Day.    Le Matin by Jean-Pierre Challet of Ici Bistro.  It is a very bright space, with a selection of croissants, brioches, quiches, tarts and baguettes for purchase.    The smell of baked goods was too tempting - invoking anyone to take a few more sips of air just to enjoy the aroma.    Although I was here towards the end of the day, there was still a great selection to choose from.  I opted for a Pecan Croissant.  It was the right balance of flaky and buttery and not as heavy or sweet like its Almond counterpart.  Not overly sweet.  Just right.  We were also offered samples of their chocolate cake, which as Cindy H. has already stated looks deceiving.  While I expected an extremely dense, dry and heavy cake it was surprisingly rich, moist and light.    I am definitely going to come back to try out some of the other yummies."}
{"text":"Yvonne T. gave me the heads up about this place and told me the baguettes and quiches are fantastic.  I got both the classic as well as the whole grain baguettes as well as the mushroom quiche.   I have to say I really liked this place and the woman behind the counter was so helpful.  She took the time to go through everything they offer in each fridge.  She explained to me where the actual bakery is (this place was too small to have their own bakery there) and told me a bit about the business and gave me the names of a few restaurants that they supply baguettes for.  She was very friendly (I wish I could remember her name) and loved that she wasn't pressuring me even though there was another customer behind me. Immediately I tried both a piece of each baguettes and they were both amazing.  The outside is crispy but the inside is so soft with a bit of saltiness(more so with the whole grain) and sweetness to it.  The price was fantastic too at $2.50 & $3.00 for the classic and whole grain respectively.  The quiche was $5.50 and as soon as I got home I threw that thing into my oven and after 10 minutes, I just demolished this thing.  I don't even know how to explain how this tasted except that it was so yummy.  The texture was really nice with the crispness of the tart shell and softness of the egg.  The flavor was incredible. The shop: cozy but nice atmoshere.   Will I come back again?  Of course!  I really like these  baguettes and I wouldn't mind trying more quiches."}
{"text":"This is a great new addition to the neighborhood.  They were selling their goods at the Leslieville market in the summer, so it is great that they have a permanent location. I have tried the croissants, pain au chocolate, quiches and the baguette.   Everything here is fresh and very authentically French."}
{"text":"We had a croissant here today, light and buttery...yum...  There was also a variety of other pastries available - I love croissants so I had to give it a try.    I liked the decor too - quaint and impossibly French!"}
{"text":"The space is nice, the staff was really friendly, the place still seem bare or lacks warmth.  The croissant seem to be like a lighter version of that from Thabor. I prefer Thabor's for the moment.   The Banana Cake was suggested to be eaten warmed up. I think warmed up with ice cream would be preferable. When you heat it up, it seems like a variation of sticky toffee pudding.   Will have to try their quiche and baguette next time."}
