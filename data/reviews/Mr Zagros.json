{"text":"This is my go-to place for shawarma. I usually get the Chicken Shawarma and it tastes very good. When the store first opened, it used to cost $7 but as they got popular the prices increased to around $9 for a wrap. It's very filling and tastes very good. It usually takes a while to get the food but it's not the staffs fault, it just takes a while to prepare the food. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Update:
Had their shawarma on a wrap (they also have it on a pita for dollar less) and it was good. I like how they mix all the fixings in a bowl before wrapping it up so you are not biting on just salad on one bite and meat on the next


Went for lunch 2 days ago for the first time and so far got a really good first impressions. I was warned ahead of time that they are little on the pricey side but their portions were huge. I was more concerned about quality. 

I ordered beef shawarma plate with everything on it and it was delicious. Everything was fresh. Again, huge portion and I ended up eating the remainder the following day. 

The only reason I kept the 1 star is that it is a shawarma joint and if will upgrade once i have their Shawarma. 

Will definetly be back"}
{"text":"The service took forever and the staff were fairly rude.  Additionally, they didn't inform me that there would be a 40 minute wait..."}
{"text":"Might be my favourite restaurant north of the 401. Food is outstanding. Value for your dollar is simply ridiculous. Service is excellent as well. I live 5 mins away and couldn't be more thrilled. That being said, this spot is well worth the trek for anyone outside of the Maple/Woodbridge area."}
{"text":"Good food, good size, and good price. I would like to add that to reach the 5 stars level, you guys need to enhance more of the flavor. If you are presenting Turkish cuisine, then you need to work on it and keep it the same in every plate. If you present Greek or Mediterranean flavor, then keep it this way. I hope I am not confusing you, all i meant to say that every cuisine has a unique food flavor that comes with it, find it, enhance it, and keep it. 
People enjoy the place and need to keep coming back for the taste of your food, I am certainly one of them. Good luck you really make people happy with you menu"}
{"text":"Tried this place yesterday.  Liked it so much i am back! Friendly service. Excellent food quality and flavour. Had the Zargos Mixed and ordered it again!!! Large portions. Good prices. Highly recomend this new Mediterranean eatery."}
{"text":"Ordered catering for 32 people. It was fresh, perfectly and conveniently packed, warm when opened, ready for us on pick-up time (I.e. They weren't scrambling to put together), and most importantly absolutely delicious!! Kids enjoyed too. Really good value. Totally recommend."}
{"text":"Thoroughly disappointed with the customer service. 

The food isn't so bad but isn't anything special either. However I've been here twice now to give them 2 chances. Both times I waited 15-20 minutes after walking in to place my order. I don't mind waiting if there's a line or people in front of me, but the staff fail to communicate with those who are waiting. 

Even a courtesy acknowledgement that a customer is present goes a long way, however it's clear that the staff doesn't care. 

I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is NOT the best shawarma in town,not in my opinion.  Ordered a beef wrap...probably the most unique part is the wrap itself...Its homemade. However,the wrap is over priced compared to other shawarma places and the hot sauce had an odd cloying sweet flavor that made this typically savory dish wierd. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Absolutely agree with all the great review below. Take out or launch dine-in is perfect match for someone digging Mediterranean cuisine. It's all very tasty, and generous size."}
{"text":"Awesome and much needed shawarma spot in Woodbridge. Don't know where to start. The home made pita wraps are an amazing touch on the great quality of the chicken and beef. The Adana Kebob dinner is literally the best thing on the menu. I have yet to be disappointed with the food.

The only complaint I have is that they haven't learned to streamline the process so in peak times, it's not unusual to be waiting for 30 mins for a shawarma wrap. It's just a bit unorganized but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Zagros has the best shawarma in town! 
Pro: they mix all the ingredients in a bowl before stuffing it in the shawarma or pita
Con: doing so means a longer wait time... But this place is worth the wait"}
{"text":"My favorite Mediterranean place! too bad they discontinued their Iskender! It was to die for! please, please, please bring it back!!!"}
{"text":"Bomb shawarma place. Bombbb. So good. Best in Vaughan as far as I know and I've tried quite a few over years. Like someone else said earlier, one of their winning points is that the shawarma isn't dripping in sauce and doesn't fall apart all over your hands when you try to take bites into it or get to the end. Aside from that, the flavour is perfect, they mix everything in a bowl so the shawarma doesn't feel dry throughout. Nothing more disappointing than a dry shawarma i tell u. Only thing i don't like are the bit higher than usual shawarma prices but i guess i can justify it because of the great portion they give you."}
{"text":"Got a chicken shawarma, meat was raw and  tasted so bad ,  I have been their client for the past 2 years lately the quality has changed . Not coming back here ."}
{"text":"Great service! 
Staff is super friendly! 
AMAZING chicken shawarma, it was massive couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"Started off loving this place after my first visit but the portion sizes for the shawarma have gone down ridiculously even when asking for extra vegetables (so that your shawarma isn't all bread) they ignore your request. Generally the shawarma tastes good depending on who makes it but that and the taste varies pretty often."}
{"text":"Absolute favourite chicken shawarma I ever had in my life ! Occasionally will have cravings and drive 20 mins just to have the shawarma . The bread is fresh along with everything else , the portion size is huge and you get what you paid for."}
{"text":"I'm sorry for leaving a 1 star review but this is based on my own opinion and I think it's very fair, I don't know how this place got rated with high stars, I'm guessing that they were left by employees or store friends.

I called and ordered delivery, I asked for one sandwich of Gyros and I said I want it done in Greek Style and I specified exactly that Greek style would be onions, tomatoes and tzatziki sauce only and it wasn't like how I requested they added lettuce which I never asked for, not only that but they brought and charged me for two sandwiches even though I only asked for one! I asked for the mixed beef and chicken shawarma platter with Greek salad as a part of it, they put a garden salad instead and they brought an extra Greek salad for an extra charge, so there is defiantly a mis-understanding in the English language.

The Gyros was wrapped in a large pita with a lot of bread dough with only a little bit of very thinly sliced Gyros in there, I can hardly taste the Gyros due to the volume of their bread and lettuce which I never asked for, so I left a lot of bread that I didn't eat.

The Gyros tasted good, most restaurants buy the Gyros ready from a wholesaler, so Gyros tastes the same almost everywhere, the problem is the restaurant got to know to not use a huge bread for it, some restaurants would put thicker slices of Gyros than others which is better ofcourse.

I also took photos of the Gyros that I will post here."}
{"text":"Ugh. I can't even bring myself to write a full length review because of how disappointed I am. After hearing the rave reviews from my close friends, I decided to finally try this spot. I ordered the chicken shawarma plate for take-out and drove home with it. When I arrived home with excessive drooling because of my aching hunger.... there was no garlic sauce.

NO GARLIC SAUCE. WHAT THE F***. Without the garlic sauce, this meal is EXTREMELY plain - dry pieces of chicken, some plain rice, oh and I was lucky enough to get one single potato cube in the mix. This experience was equivalent to getting a poutine with no gravy, or possibly even no soy sauce with your sushi. Horrible experience and I'll never return. Will (unfortunately) be dousing my food with sriracha instead to give it some life."}
{"text":"A friend brought me here as I was a little skeptical to try out Turkish food in a Plaza almost at 10PM. My favourite here is the Zagro mix. The portion is big and good pairing of different flavours. This is my go to place when I want Turkish food if I'm in the Vaughan area. I gave it four stars because something they would run out of sauces or little sides."}
{"text":"This place was amazing when first opened, but has gone down hill. Their taste has become more bland and gotten more expensive recently. They've become more  stingy with their portions or add ons in their wraps especially the male working there. If u ask for tatziki on the side instead of the wrap, or pickles in your shawarma, he wants to charge you for it, mean while the females wouldn't charge you... Or if you ask for extra hummus they literally put a small amount on your pita...they make you feel like they're doing you a favor by purchasing food from them.

If you ask for minimal toppings the wrap is empt and is all  bread, they should compensate it with more meat."}
{"text":"Having lived in the Middle East for 10 years has set the bar pretty high for shawarmas. However, I don't knock it until I try it.. so based on a recommendation, I tried the shawarma from Mr. Zagros.

Disclaimer: I was STARVING prior to eating the shawarma so it could have been made with dirt and car parts and I would've still thought it was amazing.

I asked what the difference was between the wrap and pita and employee told me its the same thing with the difference only being in size. I opted for 2 small shawarmas (one for my brother and one for me). 

I liked that they mix all the veggies, sauces and chicken in a bowl prior to putting it in the bread because it evenly distributes all the ingredients. 

The bread however.. the bread!! When I took a bite of the shawarma I was blinded by hunger so didn't notice it at first but the bread was so thick and dry. I could hardly taste the (copious) amount of filling because the bread was overwhelmingly dry and thick. After a long day at the beach, I just wanted something yummy but I couldn't finish the shawarma after the first few bites. I think it would've been slightly better if they grilled the shawarma- it was cold and dry. 

Based on the other reviews, I see that they have a homemade bread which I am guessing is much better than the pita. I wish the employee had told me before so I could've gone for that instead."}
{"text":"Boy, was that a disappointment! Whoever said mixing everything in a bowl has clearly never tasted a wrap not mixed in a bowl. Ordered the mixed wrap after the guy in front of me told me it's the 'best in town.'
     I just put it down after trying to eat it. Everything became one soggy mass of food with no distinct textures or taste. The reasons you don't want to mix them is so the crisp, cool lettuce mixes with the hot meat and the crunch of the vegetables. I can't imagine trying one of these again! To top it off, I think their hot sauce may just be ketchup (which doesn't go well with the mash that became the food).
     I would say there is no real sense of urgency in the service either. There are too many good options to try it again."}
{"text":"I don't understand all the rave reviews about this place, I gave this several chances coming here a total of 3 times. each time it has been so bland. like 0 flavor. like water has more taste than this and on top of that the chicken had no texture it was like chewing on tuna.... I'll give credit where it's due and the concept of having all the ingredients mixed together before putting it in your shawarma is pretty cool although there's no point if the ingredients have 0 flavor. the location is key and the concept is cool but I find it pretty flavorless. BUT keep in mind that each time I ordered the chicken shawarma so I cannot speak on the other meals offered. this is strictly for the shawarma."}
{"text":"This place in my opinion is the best shawarma place I've ever tried! Theres quite a few places in Vaughan but this is by far my favorite. I always thought this restaurant was independent because of how great the food is till I found out it was a franchise, but now I can understand why there would be multiple locations. Gonna start with the food, price and atmosphere.

Food - always great, super delicious and flavorful. No complaints at all. The beef & chicken plate is always my go-to because I can literally have that for 2 meals. The wraps are huge and definitely worth the price and amount of food you're getting compared to other shawarma places. Definitely share all the portions, ESPECIALLY the wrap if you don't eat much. Always fresh and meats are nicely charred. Great food!

Price - The pricing isn't too bad, it's generally the same average price of shawarma food with other places. I really do think the wrap is a great deal, around 10$ or so, not more for a huge flavorful wrap. The plate price is decent but I do think they boosted it a while back because of popularity. Overall, not bad, good bang for your buck.

Atmosphere - Okay, this is the reason why they aren't getting a 5 out of 5. The dine-in area is ALWAYS super dirty. The tables and chairs always have food on them. And another thing, people don't pick up after themselves. Yes its a dine-in restaurant but theres also a trash can for a reason. It's so irritating to see grow adults have the mindset of employees picking up after them JUST because they are behind a counter and wear a uniform. Anyways, gonna get off topic here with a rant lol, but yeah, area is always dirty everytime I go. And I understand that it gets busy and every employee has a designated job but they do offer a dine-in option, so they do have to pay attention to that aspect as well.

Overall, great place, great food, don't really recommend eating in though."}
{"text":"Great shwarma place. 

I always get the chicken fresh off the spit. Great flavour.

The standard hot sauce they give you isn't that great,  kinda sweet.  Ask for the spicer one,  better flavour and not even that spicy.

Only advice I have for them is to put some dressing on the salad,  other than that the ingredients are nice and fresh. 

Also,  service is amazing."}
{"text":"The Falafel's were overcooked ( very dark in color) and very dry. The chicken wraps are way too big, you could easily split / share.. I really don't understand the mixing of all of the ingredients in a bowl before wrapping it up."}
{"text":"For $13.55 you get a shawarma fries and a drink. Their fries were nice and crispy and their drink selection was above average. What let me down was their shawarma, they give very small meat portions and very large vegetable portions which always overpowers the taste. The shawarma meat was unnoticeable in my pita and really made me doubt the potential of the place. Overall atmosphere and customer service was good."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best places for medittarenean food (in a non fancy restaurant setting) in Vaughan. The portions are huge!!! Food is always fresh. I've been here at least 10 times since they first opened, and they never disappoint. I've tried their chicken Shwarma plate, chicken Shwarma  sandwich wrap, and  their beef Shwarma plate. Their meat always taste fresh (never dry or stale like in some other Shwarma establishments). They also provide a ton of ingredients including tabouli  (which is nice since some other places like Pita Land charges for that). Added with the tahini sauce, the dinner plates and wraps are very flavourful.  Dinner plates also come with a whole pita bread, and lots of rice and veggies. Portions are huge, I usually save some for lunch for work the next day. The only thing they don't provide is potatoes which if they did have it, would make the dinner plate a perfect 10. Sandwich wraps are also huge, I usually can't finish one. Service is a tad bit slow, only because they're not rushing to grill and prepare the food..which i think is a good thing because they're not being sloppy. Overall, a great place to eat for fresh Shwarma."}
{"text":"I've heard so many good reviews of this place and the food here. Yesterday we decided to get some lunch from here. I ordered the Chicken Shawarma Plate with Rice and others got a Chicken Wrap. 

Since there was a lot of us ordering the food still arrive in a decent time. The topping for the wrap are all tossed in a bowl to mix them up! Which is pretty cool. Very similar to a burrito style wrap. The Pita bread was made fresh as we placed the order and was served to us warm. 

For the plate, I chose my option of sides which were a plain salad and tomatoes with cucumbers. I had the option of choose between Couscous or Rice. This time I did go for the Rice but next time I will definitely try it with the couscous. The plate was really filling, and the food was amazing! Even the guys who had the wraps weren't able to finish cause of the size of the wrap.

But I will be definitely coming back to try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Good food. Portions are pretty big and they don't hold back on the veggies and meat. Place is always really busy so expect a bit of a wait. But everything else is pretty damn good!"}
{"text":"I came across this place using Yelp and trying to find a place to eat while at my sister in law's house near Major Mack and Weston road.

The ratings were very good and while I haven't eaten every where in the area I've had quite a bit that aren't chains which the area sadly has an abundance of all around.

I was familiar with the mall being that the cheese place is in there too.  When we arrived we were the only customers.  I had placed an order for 2 mixed shawarma (beef and chicken) platters and they plated the food right in front of us asking us what veggies we'd like and whether we would like rice or couscous.  

The plates were put together and one of the ladies behind the counter asked us if we'd like bread.  I wasn't really sure if I had wanted it or not but then she said it was fresh pita and I said yes.  The pita came on a huge long platter that was almost 2 feet long.  The bread was toasted but if I could open it up and flatten it I swear it would probably be the size of a medium pizza, the diameter well over a foot long.

The plate was not only very generous in portions but the food was excellent.  I like the option of having both beef and chicken on a very generous serving platter (enough for 2 meals) for 13 dollars!  My wife ate as much as she could but left about half the plate.  I ate all I could and I ended up leaving about 1/4.  

The salad consisted red cabbage, green cabbage slaw, tomato and parsley, and turnips as we were able to choose which veggies we wanted on the side.  The meat was plentiful and not dry, both the beef and chicken.  I had asked for the rice while my wife had the couscous and I tried both and both were both very good.  

The freshness, portions and overall quality of the food served at Zagros was in my opinion very good and I can see ourselves coming back here for more of the menu.  They have a pretty good variety from other meat dishes with choices like lamb chops, adana kebab, chicken shish, and more.  

I was pretty impressed with both the menu and the quality of Zagros."}
{"text":"Mr Zargos recently took over it current spot from another sharwarma place that closed over the summer.  I had opportunity to stop here for lunch since I work in the area so Im a regular

So i got beef sharwama wrap. The bread is home made and the wrap is massive for 10 buck. It was more filling then most burritos I had for that price. The meat was tender, I need to pick my toppings better but overall it was a good meal. Will be back"}
{"text":"The reviews do not lie! This place is awesome. The food is always fresh and you have the option to either get rice or couscous with your meal. Bonus: the plates come with pita bread on the side."}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma is basically bread and onions. Sauces were decent, chicken has minimal taste. Although they make there own pita, mine was hard and stale. If u want good shawarma in the area then go to pita golden pocket at Keele & hwy 7. For same price u get double the food, way fresher, way tastier and you feel better after eating it."}
{"text":"Mr Zagros is a small restaurant franchise that specializes in Mediterranean cuisine and boasts having the best shawarma in town. I normally go to the one in Etobicoke at Finch Ave W and Albion Rd when I'm in that particular area.

I normally get the chicken shish plate ($11.95 plus tax) which consists of a seasoned grilled chicken breast on a skewer served with lettuce, tomato, rice, turnips and fresh baked bread. It's nicely plated, the chicken breast is nicely seasoned and the chicken breast is tender and juicy, the rice is cooked well, fresh salad and freshly baked bread, Really good value price wise for the quality and the portion size which equates to quite a large amount of food for one person.

The place is really clean, the food is pretty good, healthy and very reasonably priced for the quality and amount of food you are getting. If you are ever in the area, definitely try Mr.Zagros."}
{"text":"Lately we have had trouble ordering from this place. With a busy life; we like to call ahead, place our order come in. And pick it up, and ofcourse be on our way...

But the last few times we've tried calling ahead and have had failed attempts at placing our order over the phone. The women who take the orders have been very in pleasant to to deal with as well as they do t seem to understand what we are telling them! They literally have a very standard menu and we ARE ordering what from the menu and yet they don't understand what we are saying or asking of them! And they are rude about it to us! The customers!

I am not celiac but I do have a strong sensitivity/ allergy to gluten and wheat, so when we say no barely or bread and to be safe no rice... That's to complicated for them to understand! We simply ask for meat and salads. That's it. And have not been able to do so due to their attitudes.

We've tried speaking to a few of them women and in the end said, forget it and that we will not order from here anymore! Because we are sick of the attitude, wrong orders and being disrespected!

Although the owner is very friendly and accommodating, the rest of the staff is NOT! And we hope he will learn this and make changes! As the the food is tasty, and fresh. And we have ordered and even catered from this place many times since they've opened."}
{"text":"I use to like this place but after a couple of bad experiences that involved cold food and slimy chicken, I stopped visiting. I recently decided to give them another shot and unfortunately, I was quickly reminded why I stopped going here several months ago. I bought a chicken shawarma wrap on this visit. The chicken had been shaved into bits in a tray that was sitting off the heat and out of a refrigerated area. For those of you that don't know about food handling, that's how bacteria grows. I took the wrap to go and after a couple of bites, the same slimy chicken I had last tasted several months ago was too gross to stomach this time so I tossed the nasty thing out. Oh well, good thing they aren't the only shawarma place in town."}
{"text":"Can't go back to MeVaMe after this one. 

Just one thing tho, they need to add pickles to the selection of their toppings & they need to add more flavor/spices to their chicken. Other than that this place is bomb!!"}
{"text":"The portions are pretty big. Doesn't taste bad but nothing special either. 13.55$ for a big chicken wrap with a can of coke and a bit of fries"}
{"text":"Distasteful, no taste at all! The portion is huge although just nothing tasty, Ali-baba's is way better as they have more taste in their chicken and rice than this place, who cares if they bake their own pita bread, it wasn't even good! Just like a piece of toilet paper wrapped around the stuffings that they put in a bowl and mix together, maybe thats why it doesn't taste good or the sauces were distasteful as well, I'm dissatisfied as i was expecting good food here but nothing fancy, I don't know if they even make shawarmas here because what they make is nothing like a shawarma, instead it's more like a burrito or a taco or chipotle that compares nothing to any of those, they need to learn how to make shawarmas and just because the portion they make is big, it doesn't taste good, I was honestly disgusted by the taste I couldn't even finish the shawarma and just threw it away, waste of my money."}
{"text":"Pretty good

My new go to shawarma place in Woodbridge

Tried the Beef shawama plate a couple time and it is very filling and pretty tasty as well, a solid 7/10"}
{"text":"Was driving past this restaurant and decided to try it out not knowing what to expect.  Peeked inside to find a nice and modern decor.  Service is prompt and polite.  I did not know what to order so I decided on a Chicken Shawarma since their sign boldly stated that they had the \"Best Shawarma in Town\".  Did it live up to the advertising???   Yes it did!   The lady prepared my Shawarma by putting all the ingredients into a bowl and mixed it together...such a simple thing but makes a big difference in consistency in the entire sandwich.  She also put it in the oven to heat it which is great.  The size of the sandwich is good  even though I made a mess...good thing I ate in as opposed to attempting it in the car.  The ingredients are very fresh!  Even the washrooms were clean!   And the good news is that they have another location close to me!  You must give it a try!"}
{"text":"Mr. Zagro's makes the best and biggest shawarma's I have ever tasted, they actually mix the wonderfully seasoned ingredients together in a large bowl, before putting it in this absolutely delicious wrap, and the shawarma plates are big enough for two people.
Customer service varies on who you get, some are kinda of cold and are just doing their job, while others will smile and be a bit warmer.
Seating is quite limited to 6 or 8 tables, it's a hole in the wall that has amazing food."}
{"text":"Very cold food. Probably the worst shawarma I've had. Didn't taste good. And the girls working there talk to each other the whole time."}
{"text":"At Mr. Zagros, you get to have your cake and eat it too. 

Not often do you eat at a place where every bite is delicious and the portion sizes are too big to finish. 

While I highly recommend the chicken shawarma wrap or plate, I'm sure you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. It's a family owned place and is my go-to for chicken shawarma in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"I feel like the quality of this place has remained the same but the flavor has just been removed.

Everything has become so bland, I've started going here less and less. I can't put my finger on it but yeah what was once tasty and bursting with flavors is just bland and tasteless.

A few other people I know have said the same thing so I'm comfortable my old man tongue isn't finally failing on me.

I hope they can turn it around but this has been going on for months now so....."}
{"text":"Exceptional falafel and shawarma. Even the fries are outstanding. Very friendly and accommodating staff. 

I won't be going anywhere else for Middle Eastern fast food in this part of the city. 

If you're really hungry I suggest the wrap instead of the pita sandwich. Wraps are made in house in plain view. 

The sign outside says \"best shawarma in town\". Naturally I was sceptical. After our visit I am a believer!"}
{"text":"I order take out from here often but they seem to not bother making your order until you show up. As a result, you can order ahead if you like but it won't make much difference. The food is above average but this issue really reduces the appeal of ordering a quick meal when you're in a rush"}
{"text":"I call this the place the soup nazi version of shwarma.  I have been here many times.  

When done right the chicken shwarma is good.  They have excellent Cole slaw and I enjoy their bulgar.  The beef shwarma isn't bad.   

What I do have a problem with is the way this place runs.  On multiple occasions they try to up charge me for hummus.  Now my shwarma plate comes with garlic sauce and some chili ketchup.  I don't want either of those I just want hummus. Can I not substitute garlic sauce for hummus?? I'm in constant argument with them over 50 cents.  

But the icing on the cake was the following.  I walk in around 6pm.  The place was busy.  I order chicken shwarma plate.  I wait for about 15 minutes before someone finally asks what sides I want.  I tell them my sides and then she attempts to go to this tinfoil container that contains old soggy shwarma in it.  I tell her I want fresh shwarma not something that has been sitting on a heat plate for 4 hours.  She tells me there is non ready and it will be 15-20 minutes.    
I understand it's busy.  But you can at least tell your customers that there is nothing ready for half an hour.  They don't seem to care.  They argue over me as if I'm the one wrong asking for fresh food that I paid for and try to convince me the shwarma on the heat plate is the same right out of the rotisserie.  That's like going to a bakery and them telling you this frozen loaf of bread is the same as the warm ones that just came out of the oven.  They lost a customer and will lose many more."}
{"text":"Seems like most of the negative reviews are consistent.  

While I do like the way their food is and their portions are good.  The girls here are very slow and/or rude when they get stressed out.  They make mistakes and forget to cook food when it runs out and people end up waiting.  It wasn't even lunch time either.  It was about 3:00pm when I came in.

Other than that, the food is great, portions are amazing, and the owner is cool.  I especially loved the huge in house made bread.  I really do like the taste too.  I've had the wraps, and the chicken / beef shawarma plate dinners.   But the help needs a bit of work.

I also had to wait 30 minutes for my \"one\" chicken shawarma wrap.  Good thing I'm a patient guy."}
{"text":"BEST shwarma around and made by very friendly staff.  Absolutely try the homemade wraps - fresh and delicious!  I like how they mix the toppings with the sauce in a bowl as the flavor is throughout the entire sandwich so no more mouthful of pita and lettuce.  The hotsuace is a bit sweet but tastes amazing when mixed  a with the hotter sauce - flavor and heat goodness. Prices are good for the amount of food you get, the place is very clean, and portions are BIG. I'll be back if I'm in the area for sure, don't hesitate to try this place.

Try the chicken poutine, ITS AMAZING!

THIS IS MY GO TO SHWARMA PLACE!"}
{"text":"It was great. Being Turkish I have tasted better but the food took me back home. The baklava was great but it was a bit too hard it should be much easier to slice into. The lahmacun was good but needs more parsley to make it like a real lahmacun."}
{"text":"The love is gone.  Some major changes at my favorite Turkish place.  Looks like they are now franchised and menu has changed taking off some items that were amazing. I get why the change but the family feel is gone. The food is still good just missing the love."}
{"text":"Loved it.  So amazing. Absolutely the best Shawarma in the GTA.  This is my new favourite place.  Dinner for 2 could serve 4."}
{"text":"They are always so nice and accommodating here! Love the shwarma wraps, always fresh and tasty. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Price is on the higher side compared to most shawarma places, but is standard for most donair/Turkish places. Friendly staff and flavourful food. Halal also. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Probably one of the best Shawarmas in Vaughan. Nice staff. Clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"Been here three times and the food is amazing. Any choice of meat is well cooked and everything is well seasoned. Toppings are fresh and the staff is super friendly. The best shawarma is Vaughan for sure. They do their best to tell you about everything and will let you know what's best for you if your I a certain foody mood. I come here at least twice a month and I never regret it."}
{"text":"My brother and I went to go check out the shawarma place all our friends have been raving about. We had mixed beef and chicken shawarmas as well as piedeh with sausage and cheese. It was all delicious. The bread they used was very tasty, they mixed all our ingredients in a bowl first which was a very smart idea. The only complaint we had was that the food was a bit on the cold side, would have liked it much more if it was heated a bit longer. The meat could have been slightly more juicy and we noticed that they did not have authentic taboule (our favourite ingredient). The pideh was amazing, no complaints there at all. The sandwiches were also fairly big in portion. Oh and the pita was fresh and homemade, very delicious. It was a good experience overall!"}
{"text":"Parking: Free - big lot with easy to find parking.

Washrooms: Well maintained

Experience/Venue: Some staff are friendly and some are very serious toned. The venue small, having tables on both sides of the walls (I think three tables on each side?), it's the wall couches and the chairs go on the other side.

Food: Not the best fallafel I've had but not the worst either. Priced reasonably and seems fresh."}
{"text":"Very authentic grilled meats and generous portions. The tonnes of different veggies & salads on the side make the dishes outstanding! We shared the mixed grill platter and it was still too much for both of us to finish. Perfectly seasoned lentil soup, just wish the portion was a bit bigger."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this shawarma place , got excited and ordered 3 chicken shawarma to go, we started eating in the car while driving back home, i thought it would be good,because my friend said so,  but much to our suprise , the pita was so hard and old (stale)  plus had no taste of homus , garlic sauce, i dont know what kind of shawarma the girl made or was she in a bad mood. Iam not going to get any kind of food from this place for sure. Good luck to the people to order their food from this place."}
{"text":"I'm digging Zagros!

A bit pricier but only because the serving sizes are so big. I ordered the shawarma salad and it was goooood. I really like their garlic sauce - it's not too overpowering with a nice flavour. Great serving size. I ate too fast and now I'm annoyed that I have to clear up my typos from these dang hiccups.

Zagros uses these cool meat sheers which shave the meat off the spit. And just as Faraz Q said, they mix the ingredients in a bowl for even distribution... me likey!

I'll be returning for lunch often as long as my wallet is full and my belly is empty.

NOTE: As I was ordering my food, I saw the owner making his own lunch using the same ingredients as my lunch. It's always a positive thing when you see the employees eating their own products."}
{"text":"It was not bad, but I am disappointed.

Time for Leslie's periodic 'confusion reviews.' Today's episode: The Dangers Of Hype.

I went to Mr Zagros based on a friend singing this place's praises. Said he, \"this place has great donairs.\" 

Myth #1: this place does not have donairs or any other kind of Turkish food. What they do have is shawarma, which is Arabic food.

Myth #2: this place is Arabic (see above). Well, maybe, but checking the map Zagros is a mountain range mostly in Iran. As most know, Iran is Persian and a different culture from Arabic or Turkish. Hmmm... really confusing. Zagros is a Persian name. They did not have any Iranian food in there either.

Myth #3: this is an independent mom and pop. According to Yelp, there are several Mr Zagros' running around town. This seems to be a chain or a franchisee.

OK so how was the \"Turkish\" restaurant with the Iranian name serving Arabic food (I am starting to get that feeling I get when I go to a \"Japanese restaurant\" and notice they are owned by Koreans and have Korean waitresses, there is also Thai food on the menu while the chef is Chinese)?

I ordered the chicken shawarma sandwich and was disappointed. There wasn't any flavour to it. I asked for the garlic sauce (no thanks to hummus or hot sauce) and it was sweet more than anything. It did not have the thick pasty feel authentic shawarma garlic sauce should have and there definitely wasn't any garlic taste either. Moreover, instead of using a pita they wrap their sandwiches in a thinner laffa bread. I prefer traditional shawarma pitas.

On the flip side, their shawarmas are on actual revolving pits and being grilled freshly in front of you. This is not the standard Toronto grilled chicken sitting in a tray masquerading as a shawarma parlour. 

The service was friendly. The man behind the counter was polite, cheerful and had his manner about him. He was eager to follow my specific instructions. By the way, they offer cucumber, tomato salad, lettuce, vegetables, turnips, onions, etc. as sandwich toppings and the aforementioned sauces. I think my sandwich was $8.
Other menu items are falafel and beef shawarma and the aforementioned as plated dishes.

The store has a few tables and an overhead board as menu indicating it is mostly a take-out business.


In summary: polite service, no flavour to its sandwich, inauthentic garlic sauce and a very confused identity."}
{"text":"Almost a year since I've first visited this place and I'm absolutely amazed how the food quality is still top notch, portions are still generous and the staff are friendly as ever. Hands down best shawarma place in York region (possibly all of GTA)"}
{"text":"The restaurant is in a plaza that has plenty of parking. The restaurant was clean which is rare if you have been to many shawarma joints . 
I had to wait a few minutes for my chicken shawarma because they were making the bread and chicken fresh, and I don't mind waiting if my food is being made fresh, so that was also pretty awesome! They pack it with a lot of meat! They are not stingy at all, so if you want something meaty and hearty, but not break the bank I suggest you try this place.

The young guy working there said they do delivery for orders $30+ before tax and there is a $3 delivery charge. I know it is only $3, but if you are going to tell a customer to order a curtain amount to receive delivery then a delivery charged shouldn't be applied.

This seems to be a \"dude\" spot. I was the only girl there, and the guy just kept coming in and out the place for their meat fix."}
{"text":"Nothing beats the bread. I seriously crave their wraps all the time. Delicious. Great selection of toppings and add ins. Real Turkish style cuisine."}
{"text":"Checked out Mr. Zagros for the first time today and tried the Beef/chicken shawarma plate with fries.

Have to say I had big expectations considering their sign says \"best shawarma in town\".

The meat was just mehhh, no real flavour to it, yet it was a good amount. And they really didn't give that much fries which they tried to hide by throwing the meat on top which in turn made the fries kinda soggy.  The salad portion was pretty big, but most shawarma spots will throw the salad in a seperare container so you can get more of your choice of side.

The girl asked me if I wanted pita with it which i thought was odd, considering it is supposed to come with it.

The servers were kind of cold and not that friendly, but thats not a big deal for me.

My one real concern was the temperature in the restaurant as they had no AC on and its almost 30 degrees outside and it was extremely humid inside the restaurant, so I hope the meat can stay fresh like that.

Probably wont return as there are many shawarma spots in Richmond Hill for a better value then $17 a plate for takeout."}
{"text":"Best Shwarma in town! Portions are huge and while the shwarmas aren't dripping in sauce, they're still amazing. I recommend the Adena kabob meal. I think since they've opened in June, i've already visited this place 7-8 times."}
{"text":"It appears that there's a new shawarma option at the Bathurst and Rutherford intersection. It's about time the neighbourhood was freed from being held shawarma-hostage by the mediocre establishments on the corner and Mr Zagros seems promising. 

The service is iffy at best, it's a mix of slow and confused. Good thing the food holds its own. The chicken shawarma is tasty, the beef is juicy and the portions are more than fair. What really sets Mr Zagros apart is that they bake a fresh flatbread for every wrap or dinner order. Fluffy, fresh and warm, the wrap raises the bar. Definitely the better option on the highly competitive corner."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie but this was the worst shawarma I could have ever tasted. I'm not a good critics but even a kid can tell there wrap sucks. If you are a big shawarma fan then please don't waste your time here, guaranteed disappointment"}
{"text":"We liked this place a lot. The restaurant is more of a takeout spot with some booths for a quick sit down meal. You order at the counter and when your food is ready, they call you over to pick it up. We tried the chicken shish kabob and a mixed platter. 

The chicken was delicious, flavorful and the portion was good for the price. The mixed platter came with a smaller portion each of chicken, lamb,beef and Adana kabob. The chicken may have been more worth the money and it was our favourite of the variety. The plates come with a variety of salads, sauces, rice and some sort of pita/laffa bread that they make in house which was delicious. 

The food was prepared and tasted fresh. Service was decent, nothing spectacular but again, it's more of a takeout spot. 

The desserts looked interesting, I'm hoping to try those next time we stop in."}
{"text":"I'd stay away. 

There are much better Mediterranean options in the area. 

Toppings lacked and food quality was ok. They really create high expectations with their slogan. \"Best shawarma in town\". 

Try your luck elsewhere."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this place , this location was only open for two days . Amazing staff , amazing food , super clean and generous sizings . I would definitely go back sooon"}
{"text":"1st time here after reading Yelp reviews. The food was great! They have friendly service and the portions are generous. We got the chicken shwarma plate and a chicken shish plate. Both were delicious. Will be back again soon."}
{"text":"They make the best Shawarma around. I love that they mix it all together so every bite is the same. Their laffa are perfect and fluffy. Prices are extremely good as well."}
{"text":"BEST SHAWARMA AND LAFFA... Look no further than this place.  OMG when I first seen this place and ordered my Chicken Shawarma laffa wrap, I was almost going to walk out when they put all the topping in a salad bowl, mixed it all in with the chicken and then put it all in the laffa.  I accepted it any way and tried it.... my tastebuds literally danced!  The flavors were delightful, tasty and extremely satisfying.... I got another order after I indulged the first.  Again, to my complete satisfaction.
I suggest getting the chicken shawarma on a laffa or the dinner option with double the meat.
Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Bar none the best shawarma in York Region. Great service and amazing portion sizes with a very good price! The shawarma is the star here, highly recommended!

Shawarma being mixed in a bowl plus the fresh wrap is what puts this place over the top. Their line \"best shawarma in town\" is 100 percent true. Much better than the shawarma offerings located around the area! Also, their dinner plates are both massive and delicious."}
{"text":"This place is slightly off the beaten path, located in a small plaza close to Teston road. Parking was plentiful as most of the units in the plaza seemed to be for lease. The business itself seems  to be a franchise, however I don't know of any other locations. Inside were tables to eat on and the place itself was clean with a modern decor. 

I ordered a chicken shawarma sandwich and a coke, total $11.50 with tax, I'd say this is on the higher side for a lunch sandwich. However, I noticed that Vaughan prices are higher for restaurants in this category of food. 

The wrap itself was above average in size and tasted pretty good. They bake the wraps fresh on site and it reflects in the taste. I also liked they mix the chicken, veggies and sauces in a bowl before putting the ingredients into the wrap.  this effort did not go unnoticed, my shawarma tasted consistent throughout as I ate it, there were no bland, dry or inconsistent spots of food. 

Reading previous reviews, some do mention it was bland....either, I was really lucky my shawarma was anything but bland, or it used to be much better and I have no reference point, Either way, it's worth trying this hidden gem and seeing for yourself."}
{"text":"Best shawrma place ever, I come here 4 times a week and the owner is very nice! Highly recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I really like that they take their falafel balls and crush them into their their toppings ie lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, turnips..etc so that each bite of your wrap is so flavourful. It's a small family owned business but they are always so full. Honestly everything is so flavourful and even my parents who are sooo picky like coming to this place. It's close to home and there is ample parking in the plaza. Staff is straightforward they don't go out of their way to be nice or welcoming but they get your order right"}
{"text":"This place is very very good. We had a little bit of everything. Lots of flavour and lots of homemade love."}
{"text":"Not really gonna go into depth with this one as it's already been reviewed several times. They serve up authentic shawarma. Pre mixed in a bowl with everything you'd like and then thrown in a pita and grilled. 

What puts this place above others; and why it has so many good reviews (I think anyways) is the freshness of the ingredients and the serving size. A regular size chicken shawarma here was more than PLENTIFUL. the pita they use is much much larger than your typical shawarma joint. 

For the price point; the serving size is much more than fair. I wouldn't say best deal in town, but you definitely get your money's worth here. 

Good, honest people making great, authentic food. A must try if you've yet to next time you're in this area!"}
{"text":"Their shawarma wraps here a big and delicious. They mix everything in a bowl is it is all covered with the different sauces. Don't forget to use their homemade bread instead of regular pita. Portions are too big for me but well worth it for 1.5 meals."}
