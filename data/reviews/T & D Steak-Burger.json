{"text":"Sadly, the longtime owners sold the business about 3 weeks ago, and the place just isn't the same. The quality has gone downhill. Time to find a new breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Favourite breakfast place in Whitby! Real diner feeling, food is good as is the service. Recommend a try!"}
{"text":"Ouch. Definitely not the same as it used to be. Sadly, this frequently happens with restaurants we love when the original owners move on. We will NOT be going back. Cold food, kinda pricey for what you get and not very good when there are lots of newer breakfast places opening up all around (Cora's, eggsmart, sunset grill, etc)

Wish I could give it no stars."}
