{"text":"Really good food.  All the bake shop stuff is gluten free and vegan and very tasty.  We are vegan so for dinner we had vegan crepe, vegan lasagna and vegan pie.  It was all very good. I would come again. They cook it from scratch so the wait is a bit long but worth it.  We will go back.  By the way they do have meat dishes as well but they can make a lot of entrees in a vegan way and do have vegan cheese.   I think their food would be great at a catered event!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! All healthy...Lots of vegetarian, vegan and gulten free options. Great service and overall homely feel at the restaurant sitting area. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Every once in awhile one finds a place that makes them all so happy.  To me, Choko Mocko is just that place.  Being a new vegan is not easy but the owner/operator here shows that it needn`t be a monumental task.  She is just so helpful and is so wanting and willing to please.  Everything i have tried, and trust me, I`ve tried plenty already, is simply fantastic. If I had to list one complaint its that the pasty is just a bit too good.  Basically,  its irresistible."}
{"text":"My husband bought me  a birthday cake from here this week: it was Awesome!!!!! Normally, I am a complete chocoholic, so I cannot even imagine how fantastic the chocolate cakes are?!?!!!!! But, because at the moment I am avoiding chocolate, the owner made me a raspberry maple cake-- wow!!!! It was so good, my whole family loved it, and my kids don't normally like cake of any sort (and they consume both gluten and dairy!!). So to have a gluten/dairy free cake that tastes and looks amazing is such a treat!!! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for people who need/appreciate gluten free and vegan food. They have frozen home made vegan, gluten free, dairy free food as well as a few shelves of other health food, coffee, tea, sugar free kumbucha. They also have many desert choices all gluten free, low glycemic and vegan. They have a small dinning area where they serve hot meals made on order from scratch, nothing pre-cooked so you have to wait a little but the wait is well worth it. Small family run business where you feel welcome and where you can relax while having a healthy meal. A place to discover."}
{"text":"We recently started looking up places that are gluten free and were very happy to find this place. It is family owned and operated and is tucked away in South Ajax.  Everything is gluten free and you can ask for gluten and dairy free and what not and they can most probably make it for you right there.   They make their food fresh so you may have to wait a bit but it is worth the wait. We had the chicken pesto panini, grilled veggie panini and a sloppy Joe panini. We also had their gluten and dairy free cup cakes which are decadent.  We see ourselves becoming regulars here."}
{"text":"If you have specific food sensitivities or allergies like I do, this place is a haven. Not only is the service great but the food is amazing. I have taken friends there that do not have the issues that I do and they really enjoyed the food as well. When I go here I feel like a normal person as I can order just about anything on the menu. The desserts and coffee are wonderful.   I had pizza for the first time in over 2 years!   They have recently opened a location in Pickering as well."}
{"text":"Amazinnnng food here.   The menu food is always hot and fresh and the staff are very informative on ingredients etc. The baked goods section is so enticing, I always have to ask about what each item is, and usually end up picking a few to take home.   Favorites are the cappuccino bars (when they have them!)"}
{"text":"The pros:  great food, great options!  The cons:  1)  They do not list all their ingredients which is very annoying to people who have diet sensitivities (I was eating some of their breads and feeling awful, not realizing it had millet), and 2)  They seem to get a little annoyed when you start asking questions about ingredients.  They cut you off or don't respond. This is annoying and makes me not want to make the extra effort to get to Ajax..."}
{"text":"The food here is tasty, however the customer service is rotten. When you are catering to people who are conscientious about their choices, I believe there must be understanding that people want to know what's in the food. Either be prepared to answer a basic question about what's in a product (without a snarky attitude) or label things more clearly based on diet preferences (I.e gluten free, grain free, dairy free, whatever it may be free)."}
{"text":"Beware. While their food is delicious, their prices are outrageous. I mean $9 for a loaf of bread and $12 for 4 bagels? I'm just fed up with people taking advantage of people with gluten allergies. Their products also don't last. My loaf of bread went mouldy in under 4 days as did their bagels. If you've got a spare $5 I suggest you try their cookie sandwich."}
{"text":"A hidden gem. Loved the food, fare and the owners!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite brunch places and one of the only places to get vegan food in Ajax. I love coming here with friends on Saturday mornings for some Apple Cinnamon Crepes and a Cinnamon Roll Latte with almond milk."}
{"text":"For someone who is gluten intolerant and diabetic, this place is a meca for delicious food. They use coconut sugar in their baked goods, which has a much lower Glycemic Index. So, it is a great place for a sweet treat every now and then.  Savour Pies - ALL fantastic. A bit pricey, but well worth every penny.  Breads - fresh baked every day. Try the quinoa bread (special by order only). It is like good old white fluffy bread.  Sweets - chocolate eclairs, cupcakes, butter tarts, banana bread, cookies!!! They are ALL SO GOOD.  Lunch - the chicken pesto sandwich is my lunch item of choice.  And the perogies!!!!!  I am so very thankful for Choko-Mocko!!"}
{"text":"overpriced everything...they sell the same items at superstore for much less and the owner just has no expression   she seemed confused when i asked her if they have frozen gluten free bread"}
{"text":"I'm usually a big fan of this place because it's so wonderful how wide the selection of desserts is for a gluten free and vegan place! While most of their food tastes good, I found that it's very over priced ($7 for a cinnamon roll and $14 for 3 small pieces of crepe!). I've found that some of their items also taste stale sometimes. For example, I told her that her bread tasted stale compared to all the other times I had it, but she said she baked it this morning, and she gave me attitude and didn't seem apologetic about it. The lady is nice sometimes, but other times she also has an attitude, as others have mentioned in their reviews here. This is a bit unfortunate because you would usually want to encounter someone with more patience in a specialty shop like this. Today she put up a sign saying that she would be back in 20 minutes after picking her kids up from school. She knew that we had been waiting 40 mins for her to return already (and my baby and I walked around in the snowy -10 cold weather waiting for her). When she returned, I asked her if I could sit down and she asked me if I was going to be ordering anything first (which I had already asked before she left). It didn't seem like she wanted us to sit unless I purchased something else. We had already purchased 2 loaves of bread (which was already $20!) and I was so upset that she wanted us to purchase something else just to sit down. Unfortunately, I won't be going as regularly anymore because of the customer service here."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a place like this for a very long time and am glad I can finally treat my friend, who can only have very little added sugar in her diet.   I have to say (in accordance with other reviewers) that I have to agree that their prices are a little bit over the top considering the location of the shop and that most of the products are tiny and prices not labelled. The person serving on the day that I visited was not very friendly and got quite frustrated with me when I asked about different products. I didn't spend as much time in there as I had planned to, for that reason. This won't be a place where I will be taking friends to sit and chill out, because of the poor service. It'll be an in and out place for me.   I was impressed at the selection of specialty items available though. It's nice to know that there are so many items available in one place for people who have various sensitivities."}
{"text":"I was really surprised that there's a vegan place in Ajax so I had to check it out.  Food is tasty and unique.  I'm just not too happy about the prices since it's a little overpriced and the portions are small.  The main entrees are at $14 a piece considering the place isn't fancy at all.  I will always try a restaurant at least once but I won't be coming back to this place.  I can get cheaper vegan food elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was looking for a nearby vegan bakery to pick up some desserts for after dinner for my aunt who is vegan. I was soo shocked to see that there was a vegan bakery all the way out in the east end.  Not only is this bakery completely vegan it also is gluten free and refined sugar free too. That being said I was skeptical how delicious these items could really be...  I came in on a Saturday afternoon and was pretty shocked to see that the bakery was vacant. The bakery is split into two areas - one half has a few shelves of health food items then in the centre is the bakery showcase / order desk and the far right side is a dine area with cafeteria style seating.  The lady behind the case was really helpful in describing what all the desserts were as nothing had labels or descriptions or even prices displayed.  Here is a run down of I choose:  Nanaimo Bars - One of my favourite desserts, I was shocked to see that they had these here. Tastewise these were really good pretty close to the real thing, nice chocolate coconut base, creamy \"custard\" filling, and chocolately glaze on top. Date Square - Also great no complaints, gooey date filling crumbly oat crust. Blueberry Lemon Mini Loaf- Definitely could not tell this was gluten free as the texture was perfect. I adored the taste combination of sweet blueberries mixed into a lemon batter loaf with a crunchy lemon glaze on top. Twix bar - The shortbread crust was definitely not as good as the real thing probably because it was lacking that buttery richness, the caramel filling was a bit on the bland side and missing that deep rich flavour, and the use of a dark chocolate topping instead of a milk chocolate added bitterness to the bar that did not work.  Carrot Cake - The texture of the carrot cake was a bit too crumbly and not holding together well, the \"cream cheese\" icing was more on the sweet side and missing that tanginess that I adore in cream cheese icing.  Chocolate Coconut Roll - Very dense, nothing spectacular but good if you like chocolate and coconut, simply semisweet chocolate and sweetened coconut rolled together  Overall I have to say the desserts were hit and miss but it was really nice to see that a bakery like this is out in the East End for people with dietary restrictions.  My biggest complaint about this bakery is the price. I was soo shocked to hear my total was 60 bucks for the few desserts I picked! Charging 5.75 each for small nanaimo bars and twix bars is severely overpriced! Perhaps they should consider listing the price of the items. Or maybe this is why the place was soo vacant."}
