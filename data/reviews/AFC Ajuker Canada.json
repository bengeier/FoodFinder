{"text":"Like the previous Yelpers, my quest for for an equivalent to Bon Chon's legendary wings has taken me on a fruitless quest far and wide across TO... And the closest thing I could find was Ajuker. 

Sure, AFC is no Bon Chon... Heck it's not even at Kyochon's level... but it's the closest thing we've got in TO guys. Kind of like how we've had to settle for Menchie's instead of Pinkberry, Marble Slab instead of Coldstone Creamery, Golden Griddle instead of Denny's, McMuffins instead of McBiscuits... Well... you get the picture...

The wings are decent, but they lack that super crunch crispy texture of Bon Chon... My wings were kind of oversauced like Buffalo wings, so they got a little soggy after a while. But they're not bad... for those uninitiated to the world of Bon Chon, AFC will hit the spot if you're looking for good FC."}
{"text":"Ive been here multiple times with groups of friends of 4-6 and always got the beer and chicken combo. The chicken tastes really good but is really overpriced for the amount you get. Me and my friends never get full and usually order a second helping or just find somewhere else cheap near by to get full. Hopefully they can either change the price or give more chicken."}
{"text":"This is a rating for their saucy chicken wings only.

Their other dishes ($5.00 lunch specials) such as gamjatang and a tofu soy-based soup with rice, atmosphere, and service garner but 3 stars at best.

But man, oh man, dem' chicken wings got me dreaming crazy things about their succulent meat, crispy skin, and slathering of completely indescribable but delicious red sauce dripping off each juicy what-the-heck-is-this-for-its-tastiness-is-beyond-words morsel. Me want some. Now."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Ktown sun night  and saw this place.  We were originally going to go back to the ha gow dim sum house we went to Sunday morn, but the are closed Monday.  So we headed back to ktown to get fried chicken.  This was ok.  We had 1/2 house and 1/2 fried, mandu dumplings and Kim chi pancake.  Chicken was ok house sauce was good a little spicier would be better.  Plain fried was good but improved with the hot sauce we asked for. Should have a bottle of sriacha sauce at the table. Think Mandu were storebought,  kimchi pancake was good.   Would not go back until I tried the others in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Fried chicken is like a big titted white girl...I've never been disappointed after having one.  So to no one's surprise, I enjoyed Ajuker's fried chicken, however, it only gets a 3.5 star rating.  Here's why:

+ Chicken is nice, crispy and moist, but it is no Bon Chon (not even close)
+ Both the 'fried' and 'sauce' chicken are equally as good -- so go for the mulatto (half and half...this is NOT the actual menu name!)
+ Venture to the bathroom for hilarious times (i.e. Korean lady sitting in the dark talking on her cell phone (WTF?), hand dryer outside of bathroom that shoots horizontally, etc.)
+ Only a small plate of daikon?  No kim chi?  No rice?  Is this even a Korean restaurant?
+ Suggest you get more than a massive plate of fried chicken -- you need some padding for your guts to handle all the meaty greasy goodness

I would probably never go back to this place if we had Bon Chon in Toronto, but seeing as how we don't, I will likely go back again now that I am armed with an experience under my belt."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is what I would have wanted from a chicken and beer place. Good chicken, good beer, tv and people to chat with. They provide all the standard fried chicken sides such as pickled radish, and also give free soup as well. It wasn't out of this world, but it was comfortable."}
{"text":"The first time I went here I thought the food was rather average, and I have to admit I wasn't that keen on returning. However, this time we ordered the exact same dishes (dakgalbi and dakdoritang) and they were really delicious. The dakgalbi reminded me of what I had in Korea, and the dakdoritang was delightful. The atmosphere is standard Korean chicken-and-beer hof, aka cheap and cheerful, but its good food at a reasonable price - can't complain about that. I think it's safe to say I'll be back."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for the wings here. Ever I fell in love with Bon Chon chicken wings in NYC, I have been searching for an equivalent in Toronto. I had read some reviews for this place, that it might be comparable, so I came...

but my search continues...

These wings were good, but sorry, they are no Bon Chon."}
{"text":"This place is really not good. We got the deep fried and red sauce wings and you'd think it's impossible to screw up fried chicken but somehow they managed to. They were like nuggets with bones inside. You take a bite and don't even want to swallow. The wings are greasy and the sauce was too peppery and was not pleasant. The only good thing about this place is that it's open late, but even so we're not coming back."}
