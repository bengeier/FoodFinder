{"text":"We grab a bite to eat here pretty regularly. I love having that business in out downtown area. Everyone is so friendly, the service is great, and my food always hits the spot. Our 4 year old likes it, too. I nearly always order their fries even at breakfast because they cook them just right."}
{"text":"One of the favorite things that my husband and I do is to try Mom and Pop restaurants.  Today we stumbled upon Cascade Cafe.  It was clean, bright, and friendly.  The coffee was excellent.  We both had ham and cheese omelets, with home fries.  The omelet was good, I have had better, and the home fries were so so. They were deep fried, while more flavor would be had if done on a grill.  However, this is definitely a place we will keep on our list.  The owner came out and chatted, the waitress, (the owner's niece) was excellent.  You should try this place, you will not be disappointed.  Oh, and I did notice that they have a PAY IT FORWARD bulletin board.  THAT is awesome.  A true gem in Elyria!!"}
{"text":"It's a nice lil place. The owners are nice, the omelette was good, and the coffee is also good. When I was there I didn't see a nondairy option for milk so I couldn't try a latte, but I definitely recommend eating here. It's a gem in Elyria (:"}

The coffee was excellent and it was only a warm up to an excellent breakfast. They have a nice traditional menu and a very friendly atmosphere. Anytime I am in the area, I will be sure to stop in. Thanks Katie!"}

{"text":"Great service, family owned, amazing food. We had the cheese omelets and potatoes and they were the best I have ever had. Coffee is pretty good as well. The restaurant needs cleaned up a little though. Everything is sanitary, the place just looks old."}
{"text":"I love going out breakfast in the morning. I feel like this restaurant plays a part in my enjoyment, I always feel comfortable. Even at 8 in the morning they will make me a hamburger!"}
{"text":"I'm so pumped there's a great cafe in Elyria. I had the southern sand which in a regular bagel and wow! Very tasty. Especially for the price. I paid less than $5 for a medium coffee (flavor of the day had butterscotch and rum) and my sandwich. The gentleman who was working was very friendly and made good recommendations. I'll be back here... often!"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant! Very quaint and clean inside. The food was delicious and the staff was fantastic! They even have a \"pay-it-forward\" board, where anyone in need can come in and select a coffee or meal from and it's paid for with donations by other patrons who have visited. What a beautiful concept! I had the veggie omelette and substituted grits for the home fries... It was delicious! They even put fresh sprouts on top of the omelette! Yummy! My husband had the All In omelette with the home fries. He said it was \"the bomb\"! We will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!!! This place is phenomenal and such a nice mom-and-pop spot!! Their breakfast is delicious and their special flavored coffee blends and drinks are amazing. I had a buckeye (peanut-butter) blended coffee (yes, it exists) which was absolutely superb. Off the chart muffins as well!!! If I'm ever in Elyria, OH again, i would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Found portion sizes small for the price, food was average ( breakfast ) need to compete with your competitors to get my money again."}
