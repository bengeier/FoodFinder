{"text":"Came here for lunch and had the spinach salad with salmon.  I substituted the creamy garlic dressing for a balsamic vinaigrette.  The salmon was very good and the salad equally tasty. Reasonably priced for lunch and not a massive portion - just right.  Atmosphere is just average."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Yorkville. The food is amazing as well as the service. It's a great place to go just to relax and Siva is wonderful. 5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in Yorkville. Not so big, but cozy. They have the best bruschetta that I've ever had! Also had a good fish. Worth visiting!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were walking by looking for dinner and saw the menu lit up outside. I had walked by this place for years and thought maybe we could give it a try.  The menu looked like it had a lot of fish (which I don't eat), but the owner came out when he saw us and asked if we would like to see a menu. We liked what we saw and went in. They originally seated us downstairs, in a closed in room with no windows, and maybe 4 tables. And kids. No thanks. We waited about 5 minutes for a table upstairs.  We ordered our wine and I asked about the mushroom risotto. I asked if it was made with cream and the waitress told me it was made with olive oil. I asked if I could have a little bit of cream added to it; no problem. My boyfriend got a pasta with white wine cream sauce and chicken. Our meals came (very quickly, maybe a little too quickly?) and while he was enjoying his, I took a bite of my risotto-one word-AWFUL. It had absolutely ZERO taste to it. Nothing. At the table beside us, the girl got the risotto as well, and my boyfriend asked what she thought. She thought it was ok, but her boyfriend had tried it and said the same thing, bland. I ended up ordering another meal, a pasta with chicken, asparagus, and sun dried tomato cream sauce. It was the owner who I had told about the risotto and who I gave my new order to. He asked what type of pasta I would like, and I said spaghetti. Again, my new meal came very quickly, but I got...penne...instead of pasta. Not a huge deal, but I'm not the biggest penne fan. This time I didn't mention anything and just ate it. It was ok, nothing fantastic, but ok.  Overall, it wasn't the greatest experience, and the food definitely didn't win me over. The waitress gave us a little attitude once I sent the food back. When I mentioned that I sent it back, she started to say, \"ok, but that's how you order...\" No, sorry, I asked for a little cream to be ADDED, not made only with cream, if that's what they did. Anyways, don't talk back to customers.   I'm still thinking of those few bites I had, it was literally the worst thing I've ever eaten in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Best bruschetta I have ever eaten. The owner is adorable and the food was great. This super cute restaurant is small, so make reservations just in case. Very accommodating and great wine!"}
{"text":"We've been going to Toni Bulloni's for years.  Even now that I've moved to Calgary we still try to go when we visit Toronto.  Great portions, even the salads.  Homemade taste, al dente pasta.  Very satisfying.  Not Fine Dining, but good wine prices and Tiramisu.  I guess it helps that I met my future wife there as well!"}
{"text":"My friend raved about how delicious the pizza was so our usual Friday dinner group decided to give this a try upon her recommendation.  Before going, I did go on yelp to see what others think.  Sadly I will have to agree with the majority of reviews here.  The food was pricey for what it was and not super good either.  I ordered the pizza Rustica, which was $14.95.  It tasted just ok.  Pizzaiolo is way better.  I also tried the seafood pasta and the penne in cream sauce and they were on the bland side.  The seafood pasta with tax and tip was $27, and I've had better at Olive Garden for half the price.  i know it's situated in Yorkville so they have to charge higher, but seriously, the food does not justify the price.    The best part of our dinner was the bread - freshly baked and served warm with balsamic vinegar, too bad their chef is not as good as their baker.  Oh, they also charge a \"sharing fee\", I think it was ~$4.00.  Overall, the food, ambiance and service is 3-stars,but because the food is overpriced, I'm bumping it down to 2-stars."}
{"text":"When you get here you will be greeted by Siva and you will get served by someone who owns and cares about your experience.  By far the best fresh cooked Italian and perfectly cooked fresh seafood in Toronto.  Yorkville has the best hidden secrets and thus place is a gem. 5 stars for service and food :)"}
{"text":"Came here with a girlfriend the day after a long weekend - happened to be a rainy day. The service here is excellent. We had pizza with a rack of lamb and vino galore! Portion size is very generous for the price. Would definitely come back for the food and hospitality."}
{"text":"This is THE restaurant to go to in Yorkville if you're looking for a nice, casual, delicious lunch or dinner with drinks. Do a little shopping, have a little wine, and try the spinach salad (tip: add goat cheese and chicken!). Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. While my husband and I were in Yorkville we walked by Toni saw a large crowd decided to check it out.  The host  asked if we were interest they were offering $25 summelious.  The waiter's were friendly, great food service was perfect.  Will definitely go back and recommend to all my friends."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious. Portions were fairly small (especially the appetizers). Meals were delicious though! Needed slightly more attentive staff."}
{"text":"I ventured to Toni Bulloni after the concierge at our hotel, the Park Hyatt, recommended it as good food with no surprises. Cozy in an understatement for the tiny establishment. We sat in close proximity to this adorable elderly Jamaican man and did not need to see a show as we found plenty of table-side entertainment in him. The restaurant is a bit pricey but the portions are large and waitstaff friendly. My major complaint about Canadian restaurants is the need to ask for water. Water should be served upon seating guests. Overall though, the food was good and it was close to the hotel."}
{"text":"Four of us ate dinner there last night. 2 out 4 salads were basically straight out supermarket plastic bags and the dressing just plopped on top . Boring and tasteless. 3 pastas and sea food ordered; extra large servings of canned spicy tomato sauce , COLD mussels mixed with loads of pasta and sea food and extra large shrimp .quantity does not make up for quality though. Single order of risotto came with COLD rice and fish hot , on the same plate.after a good microwaving re heat , rice came back almost too hot to eat .. Lucky we had mediocre wine to keep the mood in good spirits. 100.00 per couple , sharing appetizer and a 50.00 bottle of wine Stay away if you value your bucks and health."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Toni Bulloni for dinner tonight and we had a great time. The restaurant has a very friendly atmosphere with really good food and quite affordable. While we were enjoying a glass of wine, the waitress brought some complimentary bruschetta with some delicious beet topped with goat cheese. I ordered the primavera linguini and my husband ad the meat lasagna. Both meals were delicious! We also had the super freshly made tiramisu for desert. Siva, the owner, is very friendly and he even sat down with us for little while to chat after the meal. If you're looking for a nice place with great Italian food right in the heart of Yorkville, I definitely recommend Toni Bulloni. PS: for vegetarians, like myself, a bonus is that they can make pretty much whatever you want and not only the veggie opting in the menu."}
{"text":"I went there on a Friday night with a friend who recently moved from NYC. The Cozy ambiance of the place reminded her of many a NYC Italian joints. It is a good place to start your casual night out with, you can move post dinner to several of the bars/lounges near by. Not the best of Italian food i had, but i will still go there as it was decent enough. The service was top notch and portions are quite large. Owner/chef was very friendly and was willing to make dishes off the menu. Will definitely go back and recommend to all my friends."}
{"text":"Cozy ambiance and ok food - nothing memorable. Kind of pricey (around $20 for pasta) but somewhat justified by the large portions. Not particularly \"authentic\" Italian; for example, the bruschetta was on pizza bianca instead of toasted bread. It was pretty tasty though - the tomatoes seemed fresh and the bruschetta was full of garlic.   I had the daily special - penne con pollo - and it tasted like something I could have whipped up at home myself (and I'm no culinary whiz). Pretty ordinary. I would have preferred smaller portions for food that was more exciting and delicious."}
{"text":"Overall unpleasant experience. When I called and successfully made a reservation for summerlicious, the employee then said, \"Next time, don't call around this time (around noon). Call earlier, at 11am, or later, at 2pm; we're really busy right now.\" I was about to apologize for causing an inconvenience, but realized that he had already hung up on me. When seated, we were placed at a table in the furthest corner, when there were plenty of other available seats. We were told that there was no lamb shank, no creme brulee (apparently they hadn't set properly and therefore couldn't be served), and no mango mousse (spelled incorrectly on the menu). After we finished eating our dessert, we see other tables eating lamb shank. We asked a manager, and he told us that when we were seated, the lamb was not yet cooked and therefore couldn't be served to us. However, a nearby table was only seated 5-10 minutes after us and they were given the choice of lamb. We told the manager that we would've waited 5-10 minutes for the lamb (that's what most of us had wanted to order), and the manager replied that there was a 1.5 hour seating limit, but we had only been there for an hour. Food was mediocre at best, nothing stood out, portions were fair for someone who has a small stomach. The manager and all the employees had awful customer service - they gave us attitude and carried a tone of condescension whenever we asked for clarification. Definitely will not go back, and would not recommend."}
{"text":"Charming restaurant.  I dine here regularly and the fresh food never disappoints. As a Yorkville restaurant, it is an amazing value as the portions are quite large and the cuisine is amazing Italian fare with flare. The wait staff is very knowledgeable. If you have not been to Toni B., give it a try!   A very enjoyable time and interesting dining experience.  I may suggest that music would be a nice accompaniment."}
{"text":"Dropped in here randomly during Summerlicious. For $25 we ate like kings. It was amazing how much food came. And everything was shockingly delicious just as well. Service was great and the place was busy and bustling. Turned out to be a great night!  I'll definitely have to check this place out again during a regular night."}
{"text":"Please beware, this is not Italian food.  I ordered a fish special from the chalk board that claimed to come with spinach risotto.   The fish had a terrible taste and the risotto was uncle bens rice with some spinach tossed in.  I love risotto and it is supposed to be made from short grained arborio rice and should be creamy and served al dente.  This long grained rice was boiled to the point of being overcooked and simply slapped on my $29 plate.  The  more I think about it the angrier I get.   The Mediterranean pizza was closer to but not as good as pizza pizza rather the an authentic Italian pie.    This restaurant may draw tourists and unwitting torontonians who don't know better, but I would not go back to an Italian restaurant that doesn't know what risotto is."}
{"text":"Had their $15 Winterlicious menu and for the price and the portions, I was quite pleased with my experience here.  I had their spinach salad for an appetizer. The caramelized onions, the mushrooms, the dressing, the slices of egg.. the different textures and tastes in this salad made it so good.   For the entree I had their Rustica pizza. It was very filling, but the overall taste was nothing special.   For dessert I had a slice of caramel crunch. I've always loved caramel crunch so it was of course very good.  If the waitress who greeted us is the same as the one mentioned in the comments below, then yes, I did not feel very welcomed at all when I first walked in! I didn't see her at all after she showed us to our table. However, the man who I presume to be the owner, was absolutely wonderful. He served us our dishes and would check up on us every so often, so great customer service on his part."}
{"text":"Love the service and the food! Their risotto was really good.  Also really like the fact that I can mix and match the menu and substitute different sides with my order.  Also had their tiramisu which was amazing!"}
{"text":"It's OK, not the best italian food but very generous portions.   My colleagues both had the lasagna and it was very large.    Not my first choice for Italian food...  and not sure I will go back.  In fact, I am pretty sure I will not go back.  Ever."}
{"text":"Went for the Winterlicious menu. The complimentary bruschetta was good. I had the soup of the day for appetizer, and lamb shank with mashed potatoes for the main. Both were overseasoned. The lamb was very tender, but it was just too salty. When I told the server about it, he came back a little while later to tell me that he had tasted it himself, and it seemed fine to him. So basically he disregarded whatever i said, which was annoying. The mashed potato was ordinary. I had the tiramisu for dessert, and that was a huge disappointment. My friend had the chocolate mousse bomb cake, which was much better. Best part of the meal was the complimentary bruschetta. For 33 bucks (25 + tax+tips) it was an ok meal. Gave it 2 stars for the overseasoning, and lack of respect from the server. Not going back."}
{"text":"Great little spot in yorkville! Nice Italian food, and great owners! I had the caprese salad, shrimp linguni, and tiramasu off there summerlucious menu, and it was great! They even give complementary bruschetta which was warm and yummy. This place is great for lunch or a nice date, I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Visited this Italian restaurant for winterlicious, highly recommend staying away! Food was mediocre, arrived cold and in tiny portions. Servers were inattentive and rude. Our table was not set appropriately (we had to ask for oil & balsamic), no candle or cutlery. Ambiance was terrible, very loud and dark, tables were all extremely close to each other.  Best part of the meal was dessert!"}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious lunch for a table for 6. I made reservations and when we got there with only another table. Our table was already set and it seems only one person was working as a server, however, he was attentive and the service was quick.   The meal came with complimentary bruschetta which was delicious and a huge portion. The actual Summerlicious menu food was better than expected; majority of our table got the Salmon Cake to start which came with two pieces. It was made fresh and tasted great. I got the Shrimp Linguine and the portion was perfect; not too big where I would feel so stuffed and not small either. For dessert, I got the Panna Cotta which was not too sweet; exactly what I like.   Definitely would come back again! Side note: a couple sitting near us got the regular menu and their portions was unbelievably huge!"}
{"text":"Very nice little spot in Yorkville.  The pizzas are very good.  The four cheese thin-crust pizza is delicious.   You can have it to go."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I had spent the entire morning at Holt Renfrew shopping and were wandering around Yorkville for a quick bite to eat. We came across Toni Bulloni which was right across from Bay subway station! We went inside and were immediatly greated by a waiter. The restaurant is very small. Only a few tables. We sat down- there was 4 of us. The waitress was not very nice. She acted like she did not want to serve us. It took her a good 15min to bring us water. Then in total probably 30min to take our order... I dont know what her problem was. The food was good but over priced. The service wasn't good. I am not going back there."}
{"text":"Came here to try the summerlicious menu and was not overly impressed with the food. The lunch menu had a good variety of classic Italian foods to suit the general public: caprese salad, arugula salad, penne, salmon linguini, tiramisu...Etc. Not sure if this is a menu put together just for the promo, but overall the taste was heavy on the salt. I think their regular menu could be better and taste less like it was made in large batches. The pizza was over baked, a lot of charring around the crust, and the salmon was slightly to tough. Service was also a bit sub-par. Considering our large group and only 2 other tables, we did not receive adequate service for water refill, clearing tables, and checking on our needs. Overall, may come back... But considering how many other italian restaurants in the Yorkville area, it may be awhile before we give this place another go."}
