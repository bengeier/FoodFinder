{"text":"Great food and decent ambiance at this under appreciated restaurant in Oakville.  Their pasta is freshly made and pizza is great if you enjoy a thinner crust.  Love the bread and olive tapenade pre your meal.  Outdoor patio lacks ambiance and need some music to attract more patrons. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service... The staff was extremely accommodating and engaging. We came in late past 9pm and they still served us really well. The food priced alright, I loved the meal."}
{"text":"Buca do Bacco has a wonderful warm atmosphere. The staff make it feel like a family run restaurant (in a good way!).   The food was absolutely fantastic. The flavours were wonderful and had a nice subtlety that is missing from some Italian restaurants.    Having just come back from a vacation in Italy, we have pretty high standards and this place met them. All for a very reasonable price!"}

{"text":"We took some old friends out for dinner here. I had the Zuppa di Pesce and my friend had the Gnocchi. We both enjoyed our meals and he insisted we all try his as it was sooo good. Meanwhile my wife was making yum noises after every bite of her fish dish. The service was excellent and the decor was classy without being intimidating. We had a great evening."}
{"text":"It is a nice restaurant for a romantic occasion and fine dining. The menu is mostly pastas, pizzas and the typical Italian antipasti. They have a good selection of wines from all around the world. The beet gnocchi was pretty interesting and not bad. The spicy sausage rigatoni was good. The bruschetta was pretty tasty. The service was quite slow and poor, I've realized that there was only one server for the entire restaurant. The prices are quite high compared to the quality they offer. For these prices, I would expect a better quality service."}
