{"text":"The woman that was in the shop when I dropped by was really nice and seemed to be handling everything (cooking, serving, greeting etc.)  She was quite the hard worker.    On to the food, I was looking for something fast so I decided to get sides instead of a main dish.  The chicken wings were great, crispy on the outside and moist/juicy on the inside, seasoned well and served with a container of tangy sweet sauce with a bit of a kick (don't know what it was but it was pretty good).  The spring rolls were good, lightly crispy on the outside but not overdone, filling had the right amount of seasoning. Tried some of the noodles from a friends plate (she had the Taiwanese pork noodles) and that was tasty as well.    The place is very small, two tables and a couple of side chairs, so probably a place best suited for take out.  Four stars for the food and I gave an extra star for that nice lady.  I love going to small, family run stores, so for that reason along with the great food, I will be visiting again to try some of the main dishes."}
{"text":"The owner is quite nice and generous. I like the bubble tea there!!!"}
{"text":"Cost: Low - 90% Decor: Poor and extremely tight, can't eat there Quality: Good (sampled multiple items) - 80% Value: 85% Keeper? 100% Yes, will go back, been there twice.  Really not suitable for dine-in but when you crave for noodle soup then you would want to eat there I suppose? Such tight space it's only good for a quick hit & run, I mean eat & run; you wouldn't want to stay long for any reason.  The beef noodle soup was quite good, strong beefy aroma, perhaps a little too strong. I still rate it a solid A (Toronto standard only, it's far from the quality bns in Taiwan). I would go back for it when I crave bns.  We also had popcorn chicken (yan shu ji) rice and \"lu rou\" rice, both of good quality and have \"home made\" taste and look, it's a compliment, for the record. Keep it that way, it fits the image of a mom & pop shop, economical, good value."}
{"text":"One star for the fragrant sesame oil that perfected my Taiwanese 3-cup chicken, one star for the fresh basil leaves the were in the sauce, one star for the generous portions, one star for the reasonable price, one star because I love and miss Taiwanese food!    If you want authentic Taiwanese food for a good price, this is the place to get it.  NOTE:  This is not a sit-down, high end experience.  It's 5 stars for being great at what it's trying to do!  YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Had the beef noodle soup and the soup was too light with little flavor. The chef kept on coughing the whole time he was making dishes."}
{"text":"Beef Noodle Soup had good stock, noodles, but meat too tough. Popcorn chicken was ok.    I'll still come back to try other items just cuz it's Taiwanese"}
{"text":"Beef Noodle soup is one of my favorite TW dishes. It's okay here, for the price (and convenience... its close to home). I like the flavor of the broth. The noodles are okay, although they don't seem like the typical types of noodles that you get in Beef Noodle soup. My main complaint is about the beef... it was pretty dry & flavorless.   Also got the popcorn chicken, which I enjoyed.   It's about a 10min walk from the subway station. Accepts credit card. Street parking available. As others have mentioned its tiny inside... makes sense to get take out.   I'll probably return, because of the convenience. But I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"good food at  a great price!  food gives a very homey and comforting feeling. owners are also very nice.  I also prefer the bbt here over all the major shops in the area.  the place is very small but like all north town way businesses , take out only makes sense."}
{"text":"I was excited to come here after reading all the strong review for this place.  I ordered the beef noodle soup for 6.49.  If this review was based on the soup base, then I'd probably give 5 stars.  It was very well done, with great spiciness and flavour.  Unfortunately the beef was a bit chewy - I wasn't expecting much at this price.   However, the noodles were clumped together.  It's strange how the soup was done perfectly, but the noodles were not!    I also ordered the green onion pancake for 3.49.  It had no taste, it was just grease - I would skip this for next time.  An almond bubble tea for $2 extra.  It is ok, to be honest, a bit on the gloppy side.  I feel bad giving a poor review, but for lunch it was about $15, and it wasn't really that satisfying."}
{"text":"This is very much a mom and pop kind of shop. They serve Taiwanese food. I had the beef noodles and thought it was pretty good. The portion can be a little bigger and have more beef, but for 9.50 taxes included, it's alright. The flavor in the broth is quite strong.   Looking at their menu items, they have a very good selection of meals and snacks. I would love to try their crispy chicken next time.  Orders take a while to fill it seems. Not a big deal to me."}
{"text":"Nice place for take out food. Love their Taiwanese style fish ball with soup and the crispy chicken! The couple are really nice and food are usually ready in 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan...   Refers to the Beef Noodle($5.99) I had here, although not perfect it is pretty close to my image of it.  One look at this wonder and I knew it was it, the exact same Red BRAISED Soup and Ingredients I had made in the past following a recipe from \"My Second Favourite Website\".  The only slight dismay was the use of the type of Noodle, no biggy considering this place is a super tiny shop that barely fits a stove.  Let's just say what took me 4+ hours to stew at home, I could have easily came here to be just as satisfied in minutes.  The Ingredients were fully offered in the Soup and therefore I know the value of this item is worth every penny.  Now to less exciting portion...  The Taiwanese Style Chicken on Rice was a different story.  What makes this dish special to me is suppose to be the Basil which when Fried gives off the most amazing flavour and aroma however it was simply added in last second in this dish.  The Steam Rice was very mushy and the Chicken and Sauce wasn't that great.  The Pan Fried Egg Cake which is a typical breakfast item in Taiwan was a nice dish to find here that I haven't seen much around.  This one is more crispy than the ones I've had so it doesn't register in my head.  The aspect I liked  from past tasting was that it has a chewy Crepe exterior wrapping an Eggy interior."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for Wiki Star, there's not much non-korean food in this area so I'm so thankful for Wiki and the food is great and mega cheap. Get a combo and add just $1 for BBT so awesome. It is a small mom and pop shop so you should probably do take out, however there's lots of random seating around for you to sit, like parks, etc."}
{"text":"You know the place is genuine when the owners converse in familiar Taiwanese from the moment you walk in. Wiki Star is operated by a very welcoming older couple who cooks and serves like how they remembered it back home. Of course, it has the ubiquitous Taiwanese mains like popcorn chicken and beef noodle soup. In fact all the people that came in for take-out while I sat and ate ordered the former, which I'll probably never as popcorn chicken is rampant in Toronto and you'll always find the next best places for it. As well, I swear by my mother's own beef noodle soup toward which I am biased, but that's besides the point.   What makes Wiki Star shine are the dishes that are so Formosan they induce nostalgia: Taiwanese meat ball, oyster omelette, pork blood cakes, shredded chicken rice, minced meat rice, and intestine vermicelli. These are your hallmark, run of the mill, sidewalk stall and night market food recognizable only to the true expats. The Taiwanese meat ball ($5.99) is on the expensive side but is one of the best renditions I've had. It possesses just the right chewy outer skin, good amount of filling, a great spicy sauce to go along, and good size; definitely better than Pa Pa Chang's. The shredded chicken rice ($4.99) is one of the only times when I stared at a dish resembled as it would be prepared by mom, and tasted every bit like so. It isn't exactly as I remembered it in Taiwan, which I noted, but the familiarity and homeliness is undeniable.  I finished my dinner with a medium size winter melon tea ($3.15) which was perfect to end off a nice spring evening.   Wiki Star is a mom and pop shop and has none of the ambiance of upscale restaurants, which served me just fine. It is also a very small place with two two-seater tables, and would be crowded by any means for a eat in. The location in North York means parking can be a bit tricky. Nevertheless, I was quite grateful for the experience, both to have found a place for a taste of Taiwan and the new friends I've made in the owners. Rest assured, I will be returning for more."}
{"text":"Small noodle shop below Northtown condos.   I've been here twice and both times ordered the beef noodle soup.  Decent broth with nice noodles but the beef could be more tender.    It's a small place with only one or two small tables so takeout may be a better option.  Parking may also be an issue as there are only a few paid parking spots available due to the high traffic.  Overall it's a good place for a cheap lunch but I did have to wait around 10 to 15 mins each time which is kinda long for a noodle place"}
{"text":"They make the best popcorn chiken bento, a must try. They also have several traditional Taiwanese soups you can choose from. Sometimes I felt the sauce is a bit too much, but you can always ask them to go easy on the sauce. Nice owner as well! Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"For any Taiwanese who live in North York area, this is the place to go for a weekday night easy take-out.  It has the traditional food and bubble tea. Taste of home.  The place is small and only has two tables and four chairs. If two couples go at the same time it would be pretty crowded, so take-out would be the best choice."}
{"text":"Cheap good Taiwanese (chinese) food. Nice friendly, always happy people working there.  Only 2 seats to sit at this cramped tiny place. Would recommend for takeout only.  Can call ahead to order for takeout and pickup 10 min later."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try out this place coz I love Taiwanese food and snacks.  Having just moved back to T.O from Beijing, I was happy to see there is a place nearby for my crispy chicken fix.  Well, to my disappointment, it was the worst crispy chicken I have had.  One it was not crisp, two the meat was stale, three the only taste was salty.   I don't know where all the other high rating comes from..but, if you can't make crispy chicken right, you can't really call yourself a taiwanese place...just my 2 cents..."}
{"text":"After reading all the \"strong\" reviews this was a huge disappointment. Ordered a beef noodle soup. Nothing to write home about. Except that it was effing oily. Then ordered a cold chicken noodle. Ended up with chicken rice. Okay... I guess it was my mistake for trying to find asian food court type food in north york. I should driven to any food court in scarborough and would have gotten similar food at the same price while getting better quality, quantity, decor and service."}
{"text":"There're only two small tables, so you better grab and go. I tried the popcorn chicken and deep fried squid stick. The taste is fine but the coating is too thick. Owner is definitely Taiwanese, so I may try the oyster pancake and noodles next time."}
{"text":"Great food for a cheap price!   After reading other yelper's reviews, I had to try to beef noodle soup but I liked the sound of the spicy chicken with rice and vegetables. The soup was really good, some of the beef melted in my mouth while other chunks were a little tough but that didn't bother me too much. The broth was flavourful and had some spice to it. The spicy chicken on the other hand wasn't spicy at all and I had to spice it up myself, not bad tasting but i wanted spicy chicken to be spicy.  Not a good idea of you need a quick fix, my order took about 15mins to make and there was one person ahead. Probably because there was one lady running the show so you could consider it a good thing that the food isn't completely pre made and sitting there.  If you're in the area and want to try something different, and aren't in a particular rush, check it out."}
{"text":"After ordering the food I heard them microwaving something. Although I could hear the microwaving sound, I couldn't actually see what they were microwaving but regardless that doesn't mean good news.   Minced pork rice ($6.50) - this was SUPER salty 3 Cup chicken rice ($7.50) - This was really salty as well. This dish was not appetizing at all. The chicken was like chopped into small pieces, which was odd because traditionally it's supposed to be served with chicken bone so the meat is more tender. The chicken meat was dry and didn't have the real 3 cup chicken flavor.  The food was horrible. I definitely will not come back."}
{"text":"I feel really sorry for Wiki Star owner when I drop by this tiny little one man operation hidden in a side street off Yonge. Unless you live in the area or one of your friends tell you about it, you will never have imagine a Taiwanese food takeout place will set up shop there!  The owner/cook/cashier is so nice and friendly. He was so flattered when we comment how good his beef noodle soup is! I really like the personal touch when you can have direct interaction to the cook that prepares the food. It feels I like I am eating in someone kitchen. + 1 stars  The beef noodle soup base is excellent (complex tastes you can tell how much work and ingredients he put in order to accomplish that)... but the noodle is really soggy without any bite... The beef is quite tender.  I don't eat Taiwanese Style Chicken too much... so I cannot really comment on that.. The rice is too mushy even for my taste.. especially if you mix it with sauces it is extra mushy.. remind me of baby food.  I will definitely come to Wiki Star again if I'm in the area! BTW, when we were leaving I smell this funny aroma.. he is preparing Intestine Thin Noodle.. hmmm I might have to say NO for that one!  They accepts Cash Only!"}
