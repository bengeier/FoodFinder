{"text":"Surprisingly good pie! Fast friendly service, location location location...and great value- especially for the strip."}
{"text":"Boa Pizza! Nada para se comparar com as do Brasil, mas como vc pode fazer sua propria pizza, sua critividade Ã© limite!"}
{"text":"Was just in Vegas this week, Stopped  by this place for pizza at about midnight, they close at 2:00 A.M. They were not busy at all. So you order your Pizza a lot like subway sandwich shop, I just had sausage and cheese  thin crust, for  $12.00  for about a medium sized pie. To sum this up it was the worst Pizza I ever had, for it to be natural burning oven, the cheese did not melt very well and it was very rubbery, the sausage was pre-cooked which meant when the put it in the oven it really dried out, the sauce had no flavor just bland, no spices at all. If you plan on going here do yourself a favor and don't.  Worst Pizza Ever!!!"}
{"text":"Cool concept, fast, great atmosphere. The pizza was great, a little too much oil that made the pizza soggy (verde pizza)."}
{"text":"Ate there two nights and enjoyed the taste more than other similar types of establishments like Pieology.  The red sauce was average at best but I thought the basil pesto sauce was slightly above average.  I noticed when the place became busy, they struggled with timing of food delivery.  Salads were released at the same time as the pizza which meant the entree was cold by the time you finished with the salad.  Also noticed a tendency to overcook (burn) the crust when busy which I found strange - would have expected a more raw crust as cooks hurried."}
{"text":"Located right outside of the Monte Carlo and next to Double Barrel Roadhouse. Spacious, airy, and bright inside with an outdoor patio area.

You'll see an assembly line of employees upon entering. Pick the pizza you want and any add ons are an additional $1.50. We got the margherita with added rosemary ham, mushrooms, and spinach as well as \"the carni\" with salsiccia, pepperoni, meatballs, and rosemary ham with added artichokes. Also got the burrata with melon and proscuitto that comes with bread. Pay up then you'll get a number they'll call out when your order's ready.

Verdict: it was okay. You get hints of wood burnt taste from the way it was made. I appreciated that. Although, the carni surpassed in flavor compared to the margherita. Tip: the more add ons, the more difficult it'll be for your pizza to hold up since it's so thin. The burrata was good. Prosciutto and the melon blended well but I don't think I'd get it again for the price.

Also got a glass of Prosecco for $10 and a glass of beer for $9. They serve gelato too. 

Overall, it was a good lunch although it was more on the pricier side when everything totaled up. Would I come back? Maybe, just because I have had better. I admit, while I was in a piece of carb heaven and even eating my date's crusts, my mind and taste buds were thinking of how I couldn't help but compare it to Settebello Pizzeria..."}
{"text":"The pizza from 800 was tasty, but it might benefit them to offer a \"well done\" version of a pizza that has a little more cook on the toppings. My dough was cooked all the way through, but I would have loved to get a little color on the cheese.

Great value though for the size of pizza, $14 including a tip for a pizza that could probably feed two not so hungry people or satisfy one really hungry person.

Great location just outside the Monte Carlo as well, with seating outside that allows for people watching on the strip."}
{"text":"Crust is crispy and light, sauce is very flavorful and bursting with acidity of the fresh tomatoes. I enjoyed the pizza with meatball, sausage and pepperoni topped a a drizzle of spicy oil!! Loved it. 
They have lots picnic style tables inside or seating patio seating!"}
{"text":"Great for the strip.  Create your  own pizza, salad, burrata...it is awesome.  We were there 5 days we ate there three times.  It was inexpensive and delicious.  Great patio seating for people watching!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and salad!  Wine on tap!  Lol.  Fast friendly service.  Great prices!  Kids loved it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. People complain because they don't put so many toppings and Chinese. People are  used to   pizzas with toppings, that you can't taste individual topping. This is a very clean and flavorful pizza. Yes it's a little  pricier pizza but it's worth it, if you know what a good pizza is supposed to taste like. I like the Bianca pizza that's a no tomatoes. I get truffle cheese that's an extra $3 but only recommend that if you like truffles because truffles are very strong in flavor or sometime I get African water  Buffalo cheese $6 more very good love this cheese. I also sometime get an egg on it wow . When you go, ask for your pizza to have a chewy  crust. Sometime I go and they give me an employee discount which is 50%off  But not always just because I give them a good tip, but if you go there and get a pizza like I did YOU would pay over $20 for a pizza that's for one person this would be $8 for the base $3 prosciutto 1.50 soppressata 1.50 one egg organic 1.50  sausage $6 for extra bufala cheese and or $3 truffle cheese. But I only get all of that when I  want to pig  out like an American. Yes it is an assembly line but that's the only way they can get your pizza done by time you get to the register. Express service with quality ingredients it's a gourmet pizza love going there."}
{"text":"Great price.  Ok pizza.  Horrible service.  Takes 90 seconds to make the pizza in the ovan but these people moved so slow.  With 6 people in front of me it took 4o minutes! New system or more employees please."}
{"text":"Came in the other night for some pizza before the club. It was really good. Rodney, the guy behind the glass was really cool too. He suggested the meatballs with the pizza and It was the right choice! Pizza was out in about 2 mins. Great time and food!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Fresh and delicious!  I had the broccolini and the Bianca pizza with chicken. Its a must have."}
{"text":"Amazing service!! Ordered a verde and red sauce pizza that was tasty. It was a little soggy but still tasted amazing. The service was fabulous too!!! It was a little annoying we had to show our receipt for them to give us our pizza. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I am vacationing in Las Vegas and went with my mom to the new SLS hotel at midnight opening and went to this pizza joint and we both got the Margarita Pizza with Sausage and the Pizza looked gross and was very greasy it tasted ok but looked gross the sausage and cheese just fell off the pizza and was very annoying to see that, this was very disappointing  I am used to cheese and toppings staying on the Pizza not falling off it was different but not going again any time soon perhaps never"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced on the Strip. I don't get why this isn't higher rated. Very quick and tasty pizza. You pick how you want it and it is cooked in brick oven. Highly recommend it as an alternative to casino restaurants."}
{"text":"I've been to the one in the SLS twice, the first time was incredible. I ordered a gluten free pie, the girl asked me if I was celiac, I said yes and she proceeded to clean all the surfaces, change her gloves and prepare my pie. She notified the baker that the next pizza was celiac and both of them insured me that the oven would be wiped down as well... I ordered a Margherita base with pepperoni and mushrooms. It was divine.

The second time, this evening I went down to order the same thing, before I packed for my trip home in the morning. I asked for the gluten free crust, I instantly knew that it wasn't going to be the same. The first guy nodded at my request and started preparing my crust, not once asking if I was celiac at this point even at the risk of intestinal distress I wanted to see how far they'd go before any consideration was taken with the possibility of cross contamination.

He did not change his gloves, then passed it on to the next girl who also did not change gloves and looked utterly annoyed with her life in general and didn't add the drizzle of olive oil that's supposed to be on the marg base. She passed the pizza on to the baker who fiddled with the crust (same gloves). Then put the guy behind me's pizza in first... Slid it across the bottom then put mine in right in front. Then she fiddled with it constantly and still managed to burn the crust to ash. She missed a cut, so i had two double-size slices that were awkward to eat. 

The service the first time was amazing, the second time was the worst. Despite cross-contamination I still ate it (I was starving) with the aid of Gluten Cutter and still not an optimum solution. I could have mentioned I was celiac on my own, but I was blown away by the complete disregard for potentially debilitating food allergies I couldn't bring myself to do it like looking away from a train wreck. 

Thanks 800 Degrees for assuming that everyone ordering a gluten free pizza is doing it because it's the latest fad, rather than something medically necessary."}
{"text":"Excellent gluten free pizza and service!! The greens salad is delicious too - so simple and delicious. We ate here numerous times during our July 4th vacation, and this is one of the best gf pizza crusts we've ever had. The restaurant has a sign that says you should notify them if you are unhappy so that they can make it right, and we really felt like they were walking the talk when one of our orders came out wrong and the manager went above and beyond to fix the misunderstanding. Love this place!"}
{"text":"When I arrived in Vegas the outside of the building made me crave pizza. I finally give in two days later. I walk in and I'm over taken by the smell which was amazing. But then as I'm trying to make up my mind the worker is constantly asking me questions. I finally had to say can you please give me a moment to decide. Mind you there was only 4 guest in the whole place no need of rushing me. I watch them make my pizza and loved the process and then I finally get to sit down and give it a taste and I was highly disappointed! It was damn near cold in the middle, the sauce was bland, definitely way over priced and over rated! I got a small salad to go with it and the salad was 20 times better than the pizza and that's sad when it's a pizza place. Not a fan! I thought I was going to have an experience like I did at the Resturant \"& pizza\" and yeah, definitely didn't happen. Very disappointed with this place!"}
{"text":"Oh my.  The BEST pizza made in true Neapolitan style with top of the line ingredients.   As good as it gets.  Nicole and Steve were the absolute finest pizza makers you could ever expect.  They took the time to explain why this pizza was so darn amazing"}
{"text":"Best pizza!! And that says alot from us who come from Brooklyn,  NY

Great manager also. Thanks Priscilla for making us feel at home. 

800 Degrees at SLS Hotel need to take some tips from Priscilla.  Like staying open on a Wednesday! ! I'm sure business will pick up.  Priscilla has the business skills you need. NYC needs 800 Degrees,  plus Priscilla to open it"}
{"text":"Great FAST Pizza.  I hate waiting for my pizza, so this is why I LOVE this kind of pizza.  You get to pick out your toppings, they make it all in front of you and then you see it go into the 800 degree oven and presto, a few minutes later, pizza is served.  Tasty fun!"}
{"text":"Cheese lovers: they have a burrata bar that is supposed to be amazing. Went there and they ran out of burrata. I was disappointed but the server offered me buffalo mozzarella instead and it came with lovely artichokes, olives and some lightly toasted bread. Even though I didn't get the cheese of choice, it was awesome. Excellent all around - a huge portion!"}
{"text":"This was by far the most expensive personal pizza we've ever had. I understand if they want to up charge for toppings but $1.50 for each topping on top of the base fee of $10 is ridiculous! We spent almost $50 for 2 pizzas with 3-4 toppings each with a salad and 1 drink! Rip off for sure! To top it off the middle of our pizzas were soggy and doughy and my crust was burnt black on half the edges. This same pizza back home with as many toppings as we want is $9 total! Don't go here!!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this place. We stopped in because it didn't look too over-priced compared to all the other nearby restaurants, and it seemed like a quick in-and-out place. You have a choice of creating your own pizza order or ordering a pizza off the menu. Each topping was extra, and I ordered a mushroom and spinach pizza. My boyfriend ordered the spicy meatball. It took about 20 minutes for our order to come out, and they ended up somehow losing my boyfriend's order and had to remake it, which took another 10 minutes. The pizza crust was slightly burnt and overall the pizza was not tasty. I've definitely had better pizza. Also, in my experience pizza leftovers always taste amazing, but when I tried eating this pizza the next day, it tasted flat and awful. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Gourmet pizza options, decent salads, 2 for 1 beers (outside), and ready in 60 seconds.......enough said!  Excellent for quick eats after a show, great quality, great deal!!"}
{"text":"Personalized pizzas made fast. You start with a base (we loved the Pizza Bianca) and pile on toppings of your choice for $1.50 each. There are many food choices in Vegas, but this was one of our favorites."}
{"text":"I LOVE this pizza!  Very authentically Italian!  I will have this pizza every time I come to Vegas! It is the best."}
{"text":"This is the worst pizza for the money!! The pizza was soggy and service was horrible. Would not come back!!!"}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but wow flavorful!

I paid 31 bucks for a pizza/ salad and a soda. The pizza it self wasn't huge ( but enough to feed two people) but the flavor was amazing! And it came out within minutes! Cook was very friendly, and thanked us. Definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"Wanted to stop somewhere for a quick bite before a show last night.  First choice had a huge line waiting to get in (place just opened), so I continued down the strip and ended up at 800 Degrees.

Really cool concept, you walk in, and there's a guy working the pizza dough (all pies are same size, 12\").  When he's finished, your dough moves to the next station: sauce, cheese, the basics.  Then if you'd like to add any more ingredients you can for $1.50 each.  I chose the basic Margherita pizza, reasonably priced @ under $8.  Move down the line, pay for your order, and your pie goes into the 800+ degree oven.  It's cooked in a couple minutes, and your ready to eat.

At first I was kinda disappointed when I picked up the first slice and all the toppings slid off.  However, upon further investigation (there's a brochure right by the entrance), I learned that you're supposed to eat this type of pie with a knife & fork, I guess that's \"Neopolitan\" style.   Once I armed myself with the proper utensils, it was a much better experience.  The pizza was a little soggier than I would like, but it did have a nice flavor, the crust was great.  It did get cold a bit quicker than expected, however.  My last couple slices were at room temperature by the time I finished.

Overall, I'd say this place is a decent value, especially for a strip eatery.  Definitely better than a Sbarro, or other franchise place. However, as a LV local, I'll probably stick to my neighborhood joints in the future."}
{"text":"Tucked away at SLS you can get a delicious quality pizza for under $10. For two, we got a margarita pizza with salami and a beet barrata salad for $17. I'd say this a bargain anywhere, let alone Vegas. Perfect spot with friendly workers. My go-to spot at SLS for quick yummy food."}
{"text":"The pizza is good, but if you are familiar with Blaze pizza or Pieology, those are much better and a lot less. They have pre built pizzas or you can build your own. Be prepared to pay a lot since they charge you per topping. Ended up paying around $45 for 2 build your own custom pizzas that we wanted our way. They had tv's showing the NBA Finals which was awesome and they also allow you to charge it to your room."}
{"text":". Neapolitan pizza has a soft crust, restaurant does have the option of a crispy crust. Our carni pizza was delicious and perfect size for a late night snack for 2 guys. Would suggest 1pizza per person if you are hungry. Staff were super. Very efficient and very friendly."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas we have ever had!!!! Service is GREAT!!!! and the food is delicious. We always visit this place when we go to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great service and the pizza was good. They made the pizza in front of me and the staff was super friendly.  I was a little suprised by the price but everything was great."}
{"text":"Interesting concept, bad execution. Concept needs explaining, service personnel rather unwilling so to do. Inventory and quality control needs attention. Training of personnel, highly needed. Not worthy of the Mina Group. Food passable. Overall, a bad experience not likely to be repeated."}
{"text":"Was hopeful for this place....quick, good pizza. That all got overshadowed by the disgusting lack of organization and professionalism shown by the staff. Disappointment."}
{"text":"Not bad for a late lunch. Definitely not as good
As pizza rock but simple, straight up fresh pie ... If that's what you want, that is what you'll get. Lots of ingredients. I prefer the crispy crust. The original is just too soggy. Just a heads up :)"}
{"text":"The pizza they served was really delicious! The pizza was baked in the fire pot and cooked more quickly than I expected. And also you can see the cook making your pizza in the very front of you."}
{"text":"The sauce has no flavor except tomatoes....No spice nothing. The sausage was tasteless and awful flavored. The cheese tasted like a big glob of tasteless cheese. Two thumbs down"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, excellent service & very attentive. Good customer service and excellent food. Pizza crust is thin and perfect amount of toppings. Great place for families."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place. Didn't satisfy my pizza craving had burnt parts it was a bit soggy as well. And to top it off they didn't tell us it was 1.50 per topping. They only told us \"pepperoni\" was extra, until we got to the register $45  but whatever I guess. Wouldn't come back !"}
{"text":"Quick lunch place serving variety of pies, both specialty ($13.45 to $16.95) and build you're own from $9.95. Add on items are $1.50 each. Beware didn't see posted prices for alcohol. A sofa was $4.00, ridiculous?"}
{"text":"Everything fresh. best pizza in town come and give it a try you won't regret it. We visited this place twice while vacation in vegas. Tasty, clean, great stuff.
Recommended for people who loves pizza."}
{"text":"Would rate this a 7 if I could. SUPER SWEET! Great customer service. I'm writing this before even finishing my first slice of pizza. They are incredible!! LOVE. Put me in the best mood. Super super impressed."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever because I got to created it!  Perfectly baked and great service. This is a review for the location at SLS Hotel in Las Vegas.  Not open everyday so make sure to check when open."}
{"text":"I'm here maybe once a week... Their Pizza Of The Day is a hit or miss... more of a miss than a hit IMO. Go to their Instagram and you'll see some of their POTDs aren't normal ... Like the broccoli  and artichoke. But the Verde is my absolute favorite. Pesto, Fontina cheese, 2x bacon add sausage on crispy crust. Never woulda thought a green base pizza would be so good! The crispy crust has tiny holes so don't get too much pesto or underneath'll be a little too wet. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Still killin' it...excellent traditional pizza and great cold plates on 115 degree summer nights...bravisimo!"}
{"text":"The pizza was OMG TO DIE FOR. I think the folks who give this place bad reviews just don't understand how to pizza. Do the regular crust, and pick one of the specials. I did the gorgonzola fig pizza. SO GOOD.

Pizza orders come out really fast, and overall, it's pretty cheap. A+ would eat again."}
{"text":"The pizza and staff are great but the music with the bass is horrible.  We're having to shout just to hear each other.  Won't come back unless I'm drunk."}
{"text":"gelato is definitely my favorite part of going to 800 degrees. Although I always get a truffle cheese bread and a pizza . Every time i am greeted and handled by awesome staff always recommend this 800 degree to any of my friends and family!!"}
{"text":"Warning: I've been told I'm a pizza snob.

It was OK.  My expectations were pretty high.

I feel like they make the menu more complicated than it needs to be, with extra charges for certain ingredients and the build-your-own option.

I like how quickly and efficiently the pizzas are made.  We were there when it was busy, but it all went very quickly and with no hassles.  

The pizza was good.  Not mind-blowing by any means.  Just good.  

If I were in Vegas again and needed a place to eat, I would definitely go again over the other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This is the real Neapolitan pizza. It tends to be softer in the middle than the typical delivery pizza. That's how it should be. Stick to 4-5 toppings and ask for extra crispy if the soft center isn't your thing. Soda machines have everything imaginable, and the beer offerings are solid as well."}
{"text":"We ate this pizza a few times during our short stay. The margarita pizza was good and a very good value to have just a light meal. They also have excellent gelato and we liked both the chocolate hazelnut and the vanilla chocolate chip. We would eat here again and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Average pizza.  Crust is ok, a bit crispy.  But the inside of the pizza (where all the toppings are) is just bad.  Wet and the bread just melt with the toppings.  Definitely need a fork and a knife to eat.  Interior design and decoration is nice.  Price is about $15 per person."}
{"text":"Clean, fresh ingredients, gluten free options.  Great place!   A bit too liberal with the olive oil, but this may have been due to our pizza selections."}
{"text":"Ever since the first time I've tried Neapolitan Pizza a few years back, I've been addicted.   Normally I'm not an \"eat the crust\" kind of guy, but with good pizza, I'll do it.   800 degrees delivered for me!   I like the fact that you can add on different toppings to their selections, and you can see it being made right before you.   My wife started with the white pizza and added caramelized onions, bacon, and roasted garlic.   I had the Napoletana and added fresh Mozz to mine.   The service (the folks making the pizza) was a little slow, but the joint had only been open for 2 weeks prior.   However they should've brought out more staff to help accommodate the quickly growing line.   In any case, in went our pizzas and out in less than 2 minutes.  Super quick, super fresh, and super good!   The ingredients were good, although like most Neapolitan Pizzas, the ingredients are scarce.   I loved the crust though, just wished there was more cheese and capers.   Nonetheless, we had a great pizza and a great experience."}
{"text":"The pizza here is amazing and it really worthy stopping here if you are walking next to Monte Carlo. You choose a crust and the toppings, but they also have suggested combinations which are great by the way. my boyfriend and I liked it so much that we stopped by for a pizza there three times during our stay in Vegas. this is a real italian pizza and not just some fast food stuff.
I would also like to compliment the service! everybody was very nice and polite with us and they took their time explaining to us how everything worked there and giving us some tasteful tips."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time/money going here! This place is super overpriced and overrated. The pizza is super soggy and has no flavor whatsoever. They're very stingy on the toppings (which they charge an additional amount for a PINCH of each topping). Save your money and walk to McDonalds across the street!"}
{"text":"A fun pizza place on the strip. The gluten free pizza crust was one of the best we've ever had! It reminds me of a Chipotle- but for pizza!"}
{"text":"Pizza made to order in an 800 degree brick oven, yes please. Delicious, fresh ingredients, fast, fun environment, and located just outside of the Monte Carlo in the center of the Vegas strip."}
{"text":"This place is spectacular!!!! First of all you are greeted with employees who are in love with their job. I visited this place at midnight on a Friday night, so it didn't even matter they were packed, but they run a very efficient line. You design your pizza the same way you make your sandwich at Subway, only difference here is this place is faster. I expected that I would have to wait 15 or 20 min. For my pizza...to my surprise he said 60-90 seconds. I was like WHAT?  I also order the broccolini which he said would probably  take 4 min. Which actually was ready with the pizza. By the time I filled my soda cup up and sat down my food was ready!!!!  As I am writing this I have forced 2 slices.It is so delicious I want another slice.... I had pepperoni, basil, kalamata olives, red onion, roasted red peppers. The broccolini is a must. You never really see that on the menu anywhere. I am a local and will most certainly be back!!!!"}
{"text":"This was delicious!! Margarita with ham pepperoni sopressata pineapples and peppadews, Francisco you really know your stuff!! Thanks for the help it was phenomenal!! See ya next time, 
FORK AND KNIFE IT!! :)"}
{"text":"Just ate here, 3 pizzas, all extremely  soggy and almost watery  in the center. Could not pick up a slice without everything  falling off. To be quite frank little  cesars is better quality.  I would never return  here even if it was free."}
{"text":"Great pizza with fabulous ingredients in a nice setting! Beautiful inside & also nice on the patio to pplz watch as crowds flow by on Las Vegas blvd... Excellent wine & beer choices too... Parking in the Monte Carlo & walking to the street worked well... Fun to see the new businesses coming together! 800 degrees pizza is a gem& might be better than Westwood ultimately!"}
{"text":"Well, it finally happened ya'll. I managed to screw up a pizza order. I don't even know who's to blame for this disgrace of a pizza order. Typically the toppings I chose go well together, this time they did not. My pizza fell apart before I even got close to putting it near my mouth. Really salty, super greasy. What a disappointment. I'm so embarrassed. I completely lost my appetite. Workers were okay, smiling and helpful. On the bright side the water was cold and refreshing. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"CAUTION!

As my wife and I stood in line, looking at the array of signs on the wall, we decided on what we wished to eat. I expected to pay about $22, tops. 

We started ordering toppings: a few pieces of onion, 2 or 3 pepperoni slices, etc. 

By the time we got to the cashier, I was told the bill was $48.02. What?????

Everywhere I have ever gone, toppings are complimentary. Here, however, It turns out that they charge you $1.50 (plus tax, of course) for EACH and EVERY topping you choose, even if it's only one or two little pieces. To make it worse, the sign that informs you of this is the FOURTH one on the wall, and it's in smaller letters, so it's unlikely you would ever even SEE it. I was appalled, and I felt like I got snaked.

I am convinced they did this on purpose. I felt that this was very sneaky, and highly unethical."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, service and atmosphere! Had the baked brie and tortufo pizza, both were delicious!!! Been here twice now (once a year ago) and both experiences were wonderful! Can't wait to try their other pizzas"}
{"text":"We walked in at 10:30pm.  Place was empty.  The staff just stood there staring into space.  We had to ask if they were open.  Then we had to ask if we could order.  Then she couldn't figure out to do a half and half pizza.  Quick delivery of the pizza but it didn't wow me.  Just an average Pizza.  Very disappointing.  Never again."}
{"text":"The BEST pizza in Las Vegas, PERIOD. Amazing flavorful ingredients and amazing service. They also have a soda machine designed by ferrari that will dispense all the sodas you want. I go back and back and back. This is not your typical pizza joint, it is a pizza style from Naples, Italy. You will smell the basil and taste the amazing tomato sauce they use.  Try it, you will not like any other pizza place afterword."}
{"text":"Late night pizza place at the strip. Reasonably priced based on location and taste amazing!"}
{"text":"Price wise is good and the preset pizza are what you expect from a Neapolitan Pizzeria."}
{"text":"The place interiors is a good interpretation of a real Neapolitan pizzeria. Marble tables, and minimalist furniture...made me feel at home (I'm from Napoli Italy). 
I had a margherita doc...to be made with us products was really good. A tip: the use the same mozzarella in both the filetto and the margherita doc, but the double the price of the second one saying that is bufala mozzarella. Just take the filetto, is cheaper and very good!!!
I would strongly recommend to go there!!!"}
{"text":"If you are on a budget STAY AWAY....  NO WHERE on the menu does it state $1.50 per item.  Or $4.00 for fountain drinks.  It was very sad for us to be so quickly discouraged from being about to take our kids to a movie or a show due to the $85.22 bill we received.  So angry....."}
{"text":"very good. little over priced for pizza. but great food. dont order beer or wine. crazy over priced. go to the flamingo. But good overall."}
{"text":"Great location, good food, .... if they're open. For the record, the poor review comes from the second time I attempted to eat at 800 Degrees. 

I had eaten there once before, and I was pleased with pretty much everything I ordered, from the pizza to the salad, even the burrata (though priced a bit high) was tasty and delicious. In fact I was impressed enough that I told my boyfriend who loves pizza all about it, saying that we would try it the next time we visited Vegas. I was even able to grab a $50 MyVegas dining credit so we would be able to try pretty much anything we wanted.

We went ahead and got the voucher, then walked out of the Monte Carlo, excited for some pizza debauchery. Only we found the doors locked and the employees cleaning up for the night while a few patrons finished up their meals inside. We arrived right around 10pm (it's Vegas right?), easily inside posted hours, it's not like we were trying to sneak in 5 minutes before closing. Their stated hours are 11am-2am on their own website, 11-12am on Monte Carlo's and 11am-11pm on Yelp (inconsistent much?) so we didn't even think twice about the late hour, we were excited for some pizza.

Talk about being let down, this was our last night in Vegas so there was literally no tomorrow. We had to run back inside and scramble for another place to eat. We even had the super nice lady at the desk check the hours again, and then sat around while she changed the voucher to another restaurant at the Monte Carlo. (The Chinese place Dragon Noodle was solid, but we were pretty bummed at that point.) 

All in all we were very disappointed, it felt like being stood up for a date."}
{"text":"This was my first \"fast food\" pizza experience,and it was fantastic! Delicious sauce, fresh ingredients put on before your very eyes, and cooked in a hot stone oven until the crust is perfectly crispy. Tasted like a fine dining pizza bistro! One star is missing due to the staff just being unorganized today. Had to wait a very long time just to pay my ticket because the cashier was first helping box up pizzas and then answered a personal call on the restaurant line."}
{"text":"Love the Piccante and Sausage and Peppers pizzas that we had tonight. Great crust, quality ingredients. We also had the Burrata cheese and beets. Very nice. Good addition to the Las Vegas pizza scene."}
{"text":"Decent place, pretty good pizza. I ordered the tropical pizza with fresh mozzarella as well as the burrata with melon and a beer. The burrata was not what I was expecting; definitely not worth the $12 for it. My beer glass had white stains on it from not being dried properly. But overall, nice staff and decent setup. You order your pizza first and are rung up for it and then order your drinks. Probably won't come back here but recommend coming once."}
{"text":"Wow really good and fun! We picked the topping and sauce and within minutes we had an amazing pizza. I want to go again the possibilities are endless."}
{"text":"Delicious gourmet pizza! My husband and I were craving good pizza and 800 Degrees delivered. The staff was friendly, courteous and helpful. Fantastic place to eat. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have my own wood fired oven at home, so am a bit critical of pizza. I was quite astonished at the Tartuffe pizza (~$16.00). It was masterfully assembled... 00 flour in the crust, quality tartuffe infused cheese, good cremini, excellent garlic Bianca sauce, fresh arugula and virgin olive oil topping.. a real fistful. Masterfully baked at what must have been 800+ degrees, based on the timing, the leopard under crust, and the bubbly and blackened crust edges. Truly a good pizza of Italian heritage.  Sure, you wait in line to order, beer is in a plastic cup, but its spacious and clean, and if you relish in TRUE pizza (the reason for the stars), this is the place for you on the strip of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This is an amazing and affordable pizza restaurant, with a basic margarita pizza coming in at just 7.95 (theres only one size), and 1.50 for every extra topping.


When you walk into the restaurant, you are greeted by a subway-like pizza experience, starting out by choosing what type of pizza you want, followed by them hand rolling out the balls of pizza dough for all your pizza. You then head along the line to the next station where the cover the dough with fresh, sweet tomato sauce and tear apart a fresh mozzarella ball as well as a quick drizzle of olive oil. After that, you choose your toppings and they take the pizza into one of their three wood burning ovens. In under a minute, they pull out one of the best tasting pizzas you'll ever have."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times and overall have been disappointed with both food and service. Our most recent visit, and likely our last, we ordered and left. I told the guy working the dough (and I've seen more than once them picking something out of it which isn't at all appetizing to watch - what are you picking out?!) at the beginning of the counter that we wanted a margherita with toppings. He said, \"okay,\" and I moved down the counter to where the toppings are. It always seems to take FOREVER for these guys to get the dough perfectly shaped. A little pat here, a little pat there... This isn't art class and your little pats are doing nothing to improve the pizza and I'm yelling, \"hurry up!\" in my head. Then I hate watching them put sauce on, because it reminds me of how little they put! It's like they are challenging themselves to how little of it they can spread around and make it look like there's something there. So I'm standing there and waiting for someone else to finish it off with breaking apart and spreading around the blob of mozzarella cheese so that they can finally take my toppings order, when suddenly all of these customers that came in AFTER me are working their way past me at the direction of the counter guys. The guy with my margherita is pointing at a guy behind me to follow him to the toppings counter. The staff behind the counter pay no attention to me. HELLO?! Do any of you behind the counter think I might be standing there for a reason?! You guys left me high and dry and I'm now just a road block for all of the customers you DID remember. I worked my way back to the beginning of the counter and told the dough guy that took my order that this ordering line system sucks and that I'm leaving. He offered no apology and said he could make my pizza right at that moment, but I left on principle. I walked through the Monte Carlo to Sbarro's and got a couple of slices of pizza without incident. 
As far as the pizza goes, it's always soggy in the center. If you order sausage, beware of it being undercooked. My daughter loves sausage but I wouldn't let her eat the pink sausage crumbles. Their pizza is cooked in 60 seconds, which isn't long enough to safely cook pork.
Yea, I know it's Neapolitan style pizza, to be eaten with knife and fork, but I've had better and this place just doesn't do it for me. I wish Monte Carlo had a better pizza joint on the plaza than this."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised. I was looking for someplace new to try. My wife and I stepped in here by chance. The pizzas were much better than I expected. I would highly recommend 'stepping in' here too when you get a chance."}
{"text":"Not bad but nothing special.  Yes it's quick but it's very soggy as others mentioned.  Won't go here again."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have ever had in Vegas!!! Everyone was super nice and took care of everyone even though they were slammed! Dough was amazing! I ate the whole thing to my self! Thank you again!"}
{"text":"Great place for a small pizza late at night. We ate here after seeing a show. We were strolling along the strip and found this place, gave it a try and really enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"As far as places to eat on the cheaper side on the strip this place is a good choice. The pizzas are definitely bigger and have more toppings than your average 5-minute create your own pizza adventure place. So you can probably get away with sharing one here. The tartufo was really flavorful and definitely should be tried if you like mushrooms. The fresh arugula at the end really balances out the richness. If you're looking for a casual place to dine where you don't want waiter service you should try here."}
{"text":"Tried to order a pizza but the young lady just continued to make pizza dough and ignore us we left."}
{"text":"The pizza is really small, and the taste of the sauce is a little off. As far as thin crust pizza goes, this is pretty average. 

If you're in Vegas, I recommend getting chipotle instead. This will give you more bang for the buck."}
{"text":"Excellent pie. I had the sausage & peppers; top notch. 

High quality toppings, chewy crust, super fast. My only disappointment was being charged $4.00 for a soda.  Pizza is reasonably priced. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Where ever your eating rite now leave and go to this place!! Don't miss the spicy meat ball pizza it will change your life.."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza spots!! If you don't like thin pizza than this place isn't for you... But if you like thin crust you will LOVE!! Also their caesar  salad is very yummy!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is really good here. I am a crust snob and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The sauce is also exceptional which puts the pizza over the top. The only reason I did not 5-star is because we ordered an antipasto plate and it came with shredded cheeses, and only 2 pieces of bread for the whole group so we were a little disappointed. Otherwise, the experience was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever.... Soggy and people working there have no personality.  Excited to have pizza but not when the toppings dall off and its soggy"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great price for Las Vegas. The BLT pizza is amazing as is any that you create yourself with the Bianca base and truffle cheese. I also really like the broccolini side/app. Staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"Loved their pizza and salads. Service was excellent. Are there everyday for 5 days straight. Also affordable. If you follow them with Instagram you get 50% off their daily pizza special."}
{"text":"Great pizza I had the crispy margarita pizza. Delicious. Suace was good. Crust was great good and crispy. The mozzarella was good could have been better. The service and concept of the restaurant is amazing highly recommend. Especially if coming with a small group even children very friendly overall 5/5."}
{"text":"Nice little pizza joint outside of Monte Carlo.  They only serve individual sized 12\" pizza's which are about $10 depending on what you get.  I really like the crust and toppings are good too.  Very fast, only takes 60 seconds for the pizza to full cook in a brick oven."}
{"text":"I did have a few problems, but nothing had to do with flavor of food. Affordable Caesar salad, the best meatballs and a nice pie made my day. The add ons for the pizza were 1.50, a bit much. Music was perfect for me, but the beer price was a little high as well. 

I do recommend for all on strip to visit. Great sauce. Get the Meatballs for $7."}
{"text":"I loved my experience at 800 Degrees! I went there Tuesday for lunch and I was recommended the Carni. My pizza was made by Yoselin and you can tell she takes great pride in her work! The pizza was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing! Overall, great establishment, everything looked nice and fresh. 800 Degrees will absolutely be my go to spot every time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Loved the Pizza , Saturday night very quiet, the staff just stand around talking to each other. The management need to fix the staff or they are going to kill a good place"}
{"text":"Walk up to the counter and start your pizza they way you would a sandwich at subway. The guys working are really nice, make a good pie and not hard to look at either :D
2 topping original crust with the usual sauce plus a side of broccolini was $24. Not bad. The broccolini was spicy which is good but they were very heavy handed with the garlic.

I'm a local and I'll definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"The Pizza was really nice. I had a pollo pizza with truffle bread, the staff were really friendly, the layout of the restaurant was nice and they used lovely fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"This review is about the 800 Degrees in the SLS hotel on the strip.  I like the concept a whole lot, the speed is great and the pie was very good.  I chose the pesto pizza and added sun dried tomatoes and bacon.  Good choice of additional add on's.  I really liked the mozzarella cheese they tore up to put on the pie, I think that is really the only cheese to use on a pie, unlike the \"pizza cheese\" a lot of places use.  After building, the pie is cooked in a wood burning oven and is typlcally ready in a minute or two after going in the oven so overall, once you start the building the process the pie should be in available more or less by the time you pay.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Excellent...love it all...the taste, the concept, the service and most importantly the quality of FRESH ingredients...cooked to order this is truly Fast Food at its best...don't skip this joint...it's toooo good to past up...and being g from Jersey and knowing pizza...this is great stuff....will I be back??? Absolutely.....oh I forgot....most importantly...IT'S SPOTLESS!!!!! BIG A+++ in my book."}
{"text":"This place isn't too bad. Their pizzas are good and the environment is both family friendly and its cool if you wanted to stop by alone. Prices are reasonable I'd definitely come again if I was in the mood for pizza."}
{"text":"Their pesto pizza was the best gluten free pizza I have ever had.  Keeping their oven at about 800 degrees allow them to cook their pizzas in about two minutes.  They are an easy choice if you're staying at the Monte Carlo."}
{"text":"This place is great! It's not a sit down type restaurant- but they have plenty of tables inside and out and a great atmosphere. The pizza line moves fast, and it's worth the short wait to get a fresh pizza made right in front of you. I was really impressed at how fast that girl was throwing balls of dough in the air and making perfect circular pies.. Anyway- price is low depending on what you get. I spent about $8 on a fresh margarita pie! Took minutes to come out of the open fire and i ate every bit. They also serve alcohol- beer and wine- and have those really cool drink machines with the touch screens. Loved this place, wish I had one near me in jersey!"}
{"text":"Not at all worth it. Probably the worst version of restaurant of this style. The attempt at \"fancy\" makes for the quality of the product to suffer. Probably much more expensive than it needs to be. Staff was not to very friendly,  and our first pie had to be returned because it was burnt. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Fair prices... For someone who comes from an area with mainly big chains no hole in wall pizza places this might a littler different for you. What would be equivalent to a plan cheese pizza would be a margherita pizza. Family of 5 adults orders 3 pizza and a lg salad and was just the right amount. Most of the people in my party were not used to this type menu but all loved the pizza. Worth coming!"}
{"text":"Bustling restaurant in a great location. Despite being busy, service was fast and friendly. The prices are great, especially on the strip. Somewhere around $15/person, give or take. If you're gluten free, the GF pizza was fantastic!"}
{"text":"La migliore Pizza in Las Vegas.
The best  Italian pizza in Las Vegas
Wwwwwooooooooowwwwwwwwww"}
{"text":"Service and staff were very good. Topping selections were plentiful. Pizza tasted great. Would have given 5stars but my daughter asked for pepperoni pizza and was told they were out of pepperoni and as we got our pizza and set down I wathed them open a new bag or pepperoni."}
{"text":"This restaurant seemed pretty busy and offered friendly service. There was a bit of a line when we arrived, but the vast restaurant space with high ceilings and excellent detail made the wait enjoyable. Also, provided us time to figure out what to order. 

800 degrees offers individual pizzas which are made to order. They feature both traditional and some modern takes on pizza. They are all very reasonably priced for a 13\" hand stretched pizza. 

We ordered the piccante and zucca both were good. The piccante was very spicy due to the Calabrian chilies which were put on it. However, ours had more of the oil and less of the peppers than I would have liked. This made the crust a little soggy. 

The zucca was very good, but I felt that it was a little light on the toppings, I would have liked to see a little more quash on it and onions. 

I felt that the oven was a little hot and therefore the bottom of the pizza didn't get golden brown. But I guess it is called 800 degrees. 

We also ordered a couple of their beers on tap and they paired perfectly. Overall good experience, although my card got rung up incorrectly and a $15 tip was placed on a $40 order. 

Advice: great place to grab a pie but it is a sit down place, china and classes provided not a grab and go like Pin-up Pizza at PH.  I will be back though to try the other pizzas."}
{"text":"Best pizza by far. Great prices, especially for being on the Las Vegas strip! Definitely a must go!"}
{"text":"For brick style pizza, there are better tastier places that put more toppings. This is the worst pizza if you care about taste and temperature. Will prob go out of business in a year or two. Your better off getting pizza from Paris hotel where its hot and tasty and busy. Or in the front of planet hollywood where pizza is better than here and customer service much better. This pizza place is as dull and slow like mid day. Never bringing or recommending to anyone. My son after a bite said, this pizza sucks! About 15 bucks a personal pan, not even worth it. Targets personal pan pizza hut way better"}
{"text":"800 degrees is authentic Neapolitan pizza cooked in wood fired ovens.  You can select from their list of pizzas or create your own.  They also offer salads, appetizers, desert and alcohol.  I can't comment on anything but the pizza but the two times I visited, the crust we perfectly cooked and came out quickly.

This is not a sit down service establishment.  It is very good fast pizza in a very casual atmosphere.  The pizzas are slightly larger than a personal pizza but not enough for two.  Prices start at about $14.00.  On my next I will be sure stop by and venture into the Burrata and tomato salad appetizer."}
{"text":"Neopolatin pizza with new twists and the classics. Burrata mozzarella is nice and creamy fresh! You can tell how high quality all the ingredients are and the dough is top notch. Yet another restaurant that proves Vegas is a pizza town!"}
{"text":"I was staying at the Monte Carlo and wanted something quick and easy after walking back from the convention center.

Tried the pesto pizza the first day and added capers and artichoke hearts. I don't expect them to be piled high and deep, but I'd like to be able to see a few of each on the pie. Pesto was mediocre.

Tried again a few days later when I got the Margherita. Could have used more sauce -Â though the pizza was very watery from the fresh mozzarella.

Overall, not great. The crust is good, but I don't think anyone there really knows much about pizza."}
{"text":"Very good tasting pizzas but too soggy. Impossible to pick up a piece without the help of s fork."}
{"text":"800 Degrees is part of the newly updated front for Monte Carlo.  Decided to check out 800 Degrees since I've heard many good things about it in LA.  They actually claim to be the best pizza in LA!

I went for the Sausage & Peppers, which is their thin crust pizza topped with Italian sausage, peppadews, and caramelized onions.  I also added artichoke as an additional topping and I gotta say, I was quite impressed.  All the toppings' quality is tops and that sausage was straight up addicting.  I sorta wanted to give them a bad review just cause I wish there was more.  Usually I don't like crust but couldn't get enough of the thin crust here!  Mozza and sauce was great as well.
 
Since it is the Strip location, it is much pricier.  Pizzas are a few bucks more and for each topping added, it is $1.50.  Oh well.

Tried two salad here: Caesar and the Gorgonzola.  Definitely go for the Gorgonzola if a salad is a must.  The candied walnuts did it for me.  The Caesar was just way too bland.  But really, just get more pizza instead of salad.

Burrata options on the menu.  Will definitely try that some other time.

They also have some craft beers on draft, and at the time, Goose Island!

Overall, I dig the simple decor.  Pizza's tasty, salads can be ignored.  Funny how I had to go to Vegas to try 800 Degrees haha."}
{"text":"This place rocks.  We ordered 2 pizzas, a small salad, and 2 beers and devoured them like we were never going to eat again.

The customer service was friendly and efficient.  The pizzas were legit and tasted just like a Neapolitano pizza should taste.

The ambiance was nice and it was a gorgeous day so they had the doors to the patio open which was awesome.  

We really enjoyed this place and will go back next time we are in Vegas again.  Plus, it only took like 10 minutes from start to finish to get everything ordered, paid for, and food in front of us.  I guess that's what an 800-degree oven'll do!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say that I'm completely satisfied with the food and service here. My husband and I have eaten here twice in the last two days. They offer decent prices, quality food with lots of variety and fresh ingredients and fast, friendly service. The pizzas can be eaten individually or shared amongst two people like my husband and I did. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Yummy! The place makes your pizza in seconds in front of you! 800 degrees. Reasonable pricing. Soda is expensive but they have the cola machines that let you choose your own flavor (2) of them. Sometimes the lines get very long though. Overall, would come again if the line isn't too bad. A nice place to stop by!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. Family of three and we ordered the Tartufo pizza and a large Caesar with 3 waters for $30. Each of us had a huge serving of Caesar salad (there was left over, we could have probably chosen the smaller for $4 less) and 2 normal sized slices (think standard medium pizza from a delivery place) and it was great. The pizza was a delicious mix of olive oil, mushrooms, truffle cheese and arugula. The salad was made in front of you and with plenty of dressing. Overall, a great place for an affordable lunch on the strip."}
{"text":"How cool is that?  Walk down the line, order the crust, pick out the toppings, maybe order a salad or a small plate, and a drink and by the time you get to the cashier, your pizza is popping out of the pizza oven cooked perfectly and ready to devour! YUM! Clean modern decor, great service, convenient location and good eats...who could ask for anything more!"}
{"text":"Solid solid idea. Make your own pizza! 

So they do have a list of pizzas if you're super indecisive or not sure what you want, ranging from about $11 - $15. 

If you make your own pizza you choose your sauce - Marinara, Bianca (white pizza), Pesto, or Margherita

Then you can choose as many proteins, cheese, vegetables as you like! All toppings are $1.50 except for special ones like truffle oil, shrimp those are $3  , and $6 for buffalo cheese. 

I went back there twice during my stay in Vegas , very yummy and fast and honestly prices aren't terrible considering you're in Vegas. 

The employees are also really friendly, help you decide, give you suggestions. My bf couldn't decide day 1, so the guy gave him really good tips on choosing a pizza, also.. chile sauce is FREE topping ;)  

My pizza was bianca with truffled cheese and prosciutto. The second time I got a pesto pizza with mushrooms, garlic, chicken and feta!"}
{"text":"Love it every time I come to Vegas have to come back for this great pizza Great  prices and have a great deal right now! Pizza and a draw for under $10"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Instead of their traditional Neapolitan crust, Had the cracker thin crust basic margarita pizza. Very fresh, tasty, good quality. Don't expect a sturdy crust that isn't limp when you hold it up. That isn't how it is meant to be. However, it is very light and tasty.Meatballs as a side were good but tiny."}
{"text":"I had to apologize to my entire family for suggesting this place.  The staff (while nice) is lethargic, confused and slow.  Deathly slow.  We ordered 2 margherita pizzas, 2 small salads and a large greek.  The price is absolutely RIDICULOUS compared to the quality.  The pizza sauce has no flavor.  The artichokes have no flavor.  The damn peppadews has no flavor.  The onions have no flavor.  The red/green peppers have no flavor.  News flash...  their cheese HAS NO FLAVOR!  It takes a very bad experience for me to score this low and I can honestly say that now, in this store is the WORST food I've ever eaten and i feel cheated.  Do not go here.  It is just plain robbery.  Our food was about 20% eaten....$70 dollars later."}
{"text":"Love the pizza; it's almost as good as the original 800 Degrees. However, I couldn't stand the level of attitude from the workers. I came to get pizza when no one else was around so it wasn't like they were swamped, it was like they just didn't want to work. I stood around waiting for someone to help start my pizza while they all stood around talking to each other. Way to go, guys."}
{"text":"Busy spot on the strip. Line ordering, pay, and self-serve drinks / seating. Nice place to hang with a big group. One margarita pizza and one Filletti (pesto). Fun watching the oven cook. Margarita flavor good. The oil and toppings on the Filletti made it very soggy very quickly so I would not order it again unless they put it on something to keep the crust crispy... The white china serving plate looked nice but helped make it soggy.  Staff cleaning up were attentive as they walked around the seating area."}
{"text":"Fun casual restaurant with great pizza and salads. Our 9 year old daughter liked it so much we had to eat there twice. Great helpful friendly staff."}
{"text":"The place is awesome! It's like a cafeteria line but service is fast. Pizza is great and prices are very good. A go again eatery!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. We give it a five star rating and will definitely return and recommend to friends and family. It is fast, with great and friendly service. The atmosphere is lively and happening. You can get in and out quickly with lots of variety on the menu. We were impressed and will return."}
{"text":"Imagine a Subway style for pizzas, that's what 800 degrees is. You select it all, pay & minutes later it is out. The pizza is SUPER tasty & it's fresh. You don't have tons of grease so if you're looking for grease you may want to ask for it or go somewhere else. Also if you follow them on Instragram they show their pizza of the day. If you request it you have to do it order it exactly as shown on their picture. The benefit of this is not only do you get a unique pizza not, BUT you get it for $5. You're welcome! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Margarita.  The worst. Crust tastes raw. Not crispy, soggy and chewy. Barely melts cheese."}
{"text":"The pizza is fresh, the people are nice, the view from the deck was great and best part... only $$ great buy for food on the stip and would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"A decent enough option if you don't want food court food, but don't want to invest the time and/or money into a cafe or full service restaurant.

The Italian sausage topping on my Margherita base pizza was perfectly cooked, and tasty.  They definitely skimp on the cheese, and the ordering process can be very confusing to new customers and/or those not used to the fast casual \"Chipotle\" setup.

The environment inside had some surprisingly classy wood decor on the walls, and was a good step above what many fast casual restaurants have.

Minus stars: Parts of the upper outer crust were too charred, while the bottom middle portion of the crust was still soggy.  One pizza took MUCH longer to arrive."}
{"text":"Took the family their last night and liked it very much. We had 2 traditional pizzas and a crispy pizza. Also ordered the meatballs. A little over priced but expected for Vegas."}
{"text":"Five stars well deserved! This place is close to NYC and is so worth the ticket. The options are unique and fresh. While they were topping our options I wondered if it wasn't a bit skimpy... it wasn't.

 We got the spicy cheese sticks and boy they are spicy! Even hubby who loves his head felt the kickback from these. Worth every breath of fire.
We decided to order personal pizzas so we could have leftovers for breakfast before leaving Vegas the next morning (great heated in the oven as well)
The chicken pesto was amazing, very fresh well made pesto and hubby's pepperoni pizza was also excellent 
Job well done kitchen crew!"}
{"text":"800 Degrees has been my favorite pizza place for the past 2 years! I would eat there every single day if I could! My favorite is the Verde (basil pesto) base. Every single topping they have is delicious! I especially love the mushrooms, tomatoes, shredded chicken, soppresata, artichokes, broccolini, and calabrian chile sauce (this stuff is just enough salty & spicy)! I love the location of the restaurant and that it offers patio seating as well as indoor. I wish there was one closer to my house!"}
{"text":"I visited this pizzeria with a friend whom was allergic to gluten. The staff was well prepared for this and even went as far as to change gloves prior to preparing her food. They were quick, kind and understanding. As for the food; delicious. The pizza was awesome, though pricey... But it's the strip, so you can expect that anywhere. Great place to eat."}
{"text":"I am already a fan of 800 degrees in LA so when I looked for a late night eatery in Vegas and saw this one I thought yesss, let's do it ! The staff was so awesome and gave us really good suggestions since we were hell bent on making our own pizzas! Mine was all veggie and my new addiction is adding artichoke! It was soooo yummy! Plus you can't end the pizza experience without gelato. All of their flavors are so good! I definitely recommend this spot! We were there late and they did not push us out. We tried to be mindful about them closing so we hurried before they started stacking chairs!"}
{"text":"Good deal for a fresh hot pizza on the strip in front of Monte Carlo. Definitely better quality than grabbing a slice someplace. The pizzas are thin and for most an individual size, but you could split if you get a salad or want to save room for their gelato. You order your base pizza and then add your favorite toppings to customize to your liking. Or they have some classic choices to choose from. I prefer to make my own. I liked this pizza better than Blaze which has a similar concept, but the mozz and crust were better here."}
{"text":"2nd time here in a week, have recommended to others at same convention. Speaking as a first generation Sicilian - Canadian, Very authentic, right from the dough to the sauce, and all ingredients. Friendly service and very fast. Wood burning pizza is the best! Good job 800 degrees!"}
{"text":"Customer service is great here and the food is amazing. I had re margarita pizza and the crust melts in your mouth and has a little crisp burntness to it which tastes pretty good. I also had their small Greek salad and oh my was it big and the top was full of tasty veggies and also arugula. The rest of the salad was iceberg lettuce. The atmosphere is nice. The wait is long for the pizza but they make it infront of your which is nice. If you are getting just a salad or a \"small bite\" there is a separate line for you which is nice."}
{"text":"800 degrees does a wonderful job of crafting their pizzas with excellent ingredients and  simple yet sophisticated presentation.  My wife and I had 2 great pizzas with a baby kale salad.  All delicious and reasonably priced.  The Margherita pizza was my favorite.  Charring from the wood fired was perfect on the crust, crushed tomatoes and fresh mozzarella...fresh basil.  Well done all around!"}
{"text":"I promise I wasn't intoxicated when my sister and I went here! This place is delicious. We thoroughly enjoyed this pizzeria and how fresh all the ingredients are. 

Honestly, this place reminded me of a Chipotle. You start with a base and build your pizza based on fresh ingredients and you watch it come together before your very eyes.

I was most impressed with how quickly the pizza cooked. This place prepares all of its pizzas in an 800 degree brick oven, hence the name 800 Degrees! Cue aha moment! 

My only criticism is that the crust is very very thin and made it challenging to keep all the toppings on top of the pizza. Next time I visit I am going to have the mozzarella melted on top of the toppings in hopes of keeping them in place on the crust.

In terms of cost and value it is one of the better deals you can get in Vegas. My sister and I split a 12-inch round pizza (three slices apiece) and spent $20. I was pleased."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza if stick to basics. Each extra ingredient is 1.50. If you don't like how chintzy the toppings are, ask for more!"}
{"text":"My wife and kids ate here three or four times during our recent trip to Vegas.  They say 5 stars.  Nice clean restaurant, fresh ingredients, good pizza."}
{"text":"Great overall and authentic east coast Italian feel. The pizza is fire cooked and is outstanding. The yooge salads are also great and reasonable. Soda machine is state of the art and staff is helpful with building your pizza. 

I would highly recommend this place, especially for the cost on the strip. 

I'd definitely be careful of a la carte add ins with pizza--can add up.  

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I was definitely needing pizza on my vacation. 800 Degrees is in a great location and has great prices (compared to all the other locations on the strip)! We were 2 girls that split the Carni Pizza and the Truffle Cheese Bread - this was plenty of food for us - and it was delicious!

The Truffle Cheese Bread is served like a calzone that just oozes delicious cheese. The Carni Pizza was awesome - perfect amount of cheese and meat. (Which to me is a little extra of each)

I wish I lived in Vegas or LA to frequent this amazing Pizzeria!"}
{"text":"The pizza was slightly burnt and nothing too special for a $22.00 pizza. I didn't know that this pizza joint was more for the convenience of late night dinning hours. Also, I didn't know that it was pay per topping and I had automatically assumed it was a one fee like other pizza places- Pieology & Blaze Pizza. 

It's normal gourmet pizza at a premium. It will curve your pizza craving but is it really worth $22.00? Probably not...."}
{"text":"Our pizza was delicious. Great sauce, tasty cheese and toppings. I thought the crust was really good. The line moves a little slow because you pick your specifics and toppings as you go, but the pizza cooks quickly so all in all the wait wasn't too bad. The only negative was the lack of red pepper and Parmesan shakers ( I know they are tacky but still, I need them for pizza) and the fact that some of their advertising around town is for 800Â° Degrees. Redundant and lame. Like HIV virus or ATM machine.
But, I forgive them, because their pizza made me happy."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good but the service could be A LOT better.

Came here for takeout on a Monday night.  When I got in line, there was only one other couple in front of me.   I ordered a simple margherita pizza with mushrooms.  Overall the crust was good but burnt even for a neopolitan style pizza.  The sauce is good but overwhelmingly garlicky (and I love garlic).  The cheese melted well but soon came tough and rubbery.  The basil was nonexistent.  I was most disappointed by the first bite, mainly because everything slid right off.  

As for the salad, also underwhelming.  I got the burrata with artichoke tapanade and olives.  There was almost no arugula.  The olives were extremely salty.  Also of note, nobody bothered to make the salad while my pizza was cooking despite there being almost no wait.  I had to wait first for the salad, then for the bread to be toasted.  So maybe that's why by the time I ate my pizza it was a rubbery,  soggy mess.

Overall, pretty pricey for mediocre food.  Don't think I'll be returning if i can help it!"}
{"text":"Pizzas were good, appetizers -not so much. Appetizers were small and over priced. I wld enjoy this joint more if it were more like pieology where you can load your pizza up with as many toppings as you want for a flat fee. Instead, 800 degrees charges you $1.50 per topping unless you go with their specialty pizzas. And they are not generous with their toppings."}
{"text":"So much better than Pieology. And the garlic cheesy truffle bread?!? I was in cheese bread heaven. It's a cool atmosphere and I love the quotes and pictures all around. Tons of eating indoors and outdoors, but no TV's outside (we were there to watch football). Next time I'm in Vegas I'm going back for that truffle cheese bread."}
{"text":"Sometimes when you are in Vegas you just need to sit down and eat some, and this was one of those times. This is not your typical american pizza. and I will not claim that it is a classic Neapolitan pizza either, but what I will claim is that it was well prepared and tasty. And for a fair prize too. 

So a pizza will run you $10-$15, a bottle of water $4. But the I had a spicy, sweet type of tomato sauced pizza, and the other was a pesto and mozzarella pizza version. Both very tasty. 

The negative is the line that you travel as you order, and follow your pizza as it is being made down to the oven where you finally pay and wait. But I have nothing negative to say about this really. It is what it is, and Vegas is alot about functionality. I found the ingredients fresh and the makers honest in this Subway fashion of pizza creation. 

All in all, this place will be a staple for me when I need something to eat - and not desire a fancy meal."}
{"text":"We stumbled in on a Friday night around 1am and we were beyond pleased when a security guard directed us over. There were a couple of people in front of us, though with the set up, we were all moved through quite quickly.

We opted to create our own as I don't eat pork. The meatballs are all beef and so we went for meatballs and ricotta. Nice and easy. Everything was made right in front of our hazy eyes and cooked quickly. I believe it was ~$15 and was more than enough for the two of us to share. I liked the chili oil/sauce that was provided as it gave it a nice kick. The middle of the pie was a bit saggy but nothing to be concerned about. We just folded our slices and were good to go.

Prices are right and this is a good, quick option. Another excellent restaurant visit at the SLS!"}
{"text":"Pizza is ok. They do not take phone orders wh oh is really bad!! Wolf Gang at MGM is way better and they do take phone orders And the same price!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, super friendly staff. This is the last stop of our Vegas trip before we headed back home, my husband was saying that this should be the first stop in our next trip, so that we can go here more than once before we head home. 

We ordered a margarita pizza with prosciutto, it is unbelievable good. They put extra virgin olive oil on top of the pizza, it enhances the flavor. We were debating should we order the meatballs, glad that we decided to give it a try. It is one of the best meatball we had ever have.

Glad to know that they have 2 more stores in LA. The staff was telling us they are going to open one more store on the Strip."}
{"text":"My update is I have come here the last 3 nights and am loving the crispy crust margarita pizza. Choosing different toppings to try/experiment every night. Tom is the bomb he is the pizza cooker and has an impeccable sense for the timing of the pizza. They are open late with seating outside right on the strip!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the concept at 800 Degrees. You walk in and pick a \"base\" for your pizza... typically that consists of a sauce or oil, cheese, and base herbs/spices. After that you mosey on over to the topping selections and pick what you want on your pie. It's like the Chipotle of Pizza. Once you've decided on your toppings, your pie is whisked away to the oven to cook at 800 degrees. Pretty simple, quick and delicious!

I have typically gone with the Margherita base on the traditional crust and have yet to be disappointed. All of the ingredients are fresh and packed with plenty of flavor. Even the parmesan cheese is grated fresh for you and they make their own red pepper flake sauce to use as an alternative to crushed red peppers. Just enough extra kick to take your 'za to the next level! The Caesar Salad is pretty delicious as well! 

Everything moves pretty quickly here and the atmosphere is very open and bright - a really fantastic lunch spot if you find yourself on the south end of the strip."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!

3 pizzas, 3 toppings each, 3 drinks, 1 salad - small, 1 order of (it's not labeled as spicy and you LITERALLY ONLY GET 2) meatballs =$80!!!

The pizzas tasted ok, not $80 spectacular.

We're they fast? Yes.
We're they 90 seconds fast? NO!

The 2 meatballs cut in half went in at the same time as the pizza. They were ready 10 minutes after we got the pizza!

The \"vinaigrette\" for the salad tasted like pure vinegar.

I will never eat here again and will tell everyone I know to avoid this gimmicky robbery.

My husband is what stopped me from telling people in line to leave! I've eaten all kinds of pizza. Gourmet and chain - this place is lousy.

Find a Mod Pizza! Order online to skip line and UNLIMITED TOPPINGS!!"}
{"text":"Okay folks, the Tarfufo is the way to go! I ordered mine with no cheese and it was simple and delicious.  I love roasted garlic and cartelized onion and this was the pizza for me. It was priced reasonably and convenient to my hotel.  I would visit again when in town."}
{"text":"OMG so good!!!! One of us loves the truffle bread and the other one of us loves the carni pizza. Just what he doctor ordered. 

Get one pizza per person they are not big enough to share."}
{"text":"Run.... the people working there hate there jobs and they don't care if you like it or not, the pizza isn't wroth it, every topping is like $4.00 or something crazy like that... if their busy be prepared to wait... smh"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed , just keep on walking to New York New York, and get a better pizza. It was a waste of time, I wish I can have that back."}
{"text":"Wow, I did not know you could eat an amazing meal on the strip for under $15. 
My brother recommended we eat here after he tried it, we ordered a tropicali and split it ( this was enough food for two grown men to have lunch). With 2 sodas and the \"specialty\" pizza it was $20. But you can get say a cheese or margarita pizza and hack about 7-10 bucks off that price. TouchÃ©! 
The pizza was good, the cook time was more impressive. But, why I gave it three stars ( I am almost giving one because this is wrong) the guy that cuts the calzones and the pizza blows on them with his mouth to get the excess crumbs off. I'm sorry but please do not blow on my food dude. And the service was not the best. The employees walked about unhappy like they were forced to be there. The young guy that cleaned off our table was pretty friendly though, he was concerned with how the food, and service were. Kudos to him. I will return and maybe update the review. Pizza gets a 5. Service gets a 2. Environment 3, food safety 2. Total of 3 out of 5."}
{"text":"All of the salads are great nice and fresh!! Same with the pizza too! Thin crust wholesome and fresh! Extremely difficult to resists ! Mmmmn..."}
{"text":"Awesome pizzas, great location just outside of Monte Carlo, and good pricing"}
{"text":"5 Stars for the service and hard work of the staff/ chef. I don't blame them for my dissatisfaction... it's the flavor OR LACK THERE OF with the food that disappoints me.
Seriously, spent $40 on food that \"Blaze Pizza\" could do better. Hell, little Caesars is better tasting."}
{"text":"Seriously so good!! Like amazing!I love that you can make your own or go with a classic. And there's some amazing pepper hot sauce they have on the side that is a must , only problem is I wish I lived closer to it!"}
{"text":"Just a heads up: it's NEAPOLITAN pizza.
It's \"soggy\" in the middle, the toppings are applied sparingly, and each pizza is about the size of a Frisbee- ON PURPOSE. You will likely need to use a fork to consume your pie. Go ahead and Google \"NEAPOLITAN pizza\" if you don't believe me, I'll wait.

Now that you know what to expect, you can disregard all of the reviews posted by those who didn't. The walk-up ordering counter leaves something to be desired in terms of service. Their featured pies should be better, considering they're featured. Don't waste time on the salads or \"small bites\", but take note of the burrata options: beet, artichoke/olive, tomato/pesto, and prosciutto/melon. Unexpectedly well executed.

Unless you want a Margherita pizza, most other styles here will not have sauce- I personally prefer the Verde style with pesto, add mushrooms and/or truffle cheese and/or prosciutto if you like. If you're feeling especially adventurous, try the BLT, with bacon jam, arugula, and cherry tomatoes. It's a very confusing party for your mouth."}
{"text":"Quick, late night eat, and right next to Life night club(GENIUS!)

Must eat fresh! Pizza gets soggy real fast!

We wanted to get extra sauce but were warned not to since the pizza gets soggy. Even though we didn't get extra sauce, pizza still came out soggy. Had to fold it in half just to eat it. Get their sausages (Best gourmet sausages I've ever had in my life)."}
{"text":"We went there twice in 3 days, that is how much we loved this place. We had the margherita pizza and the green sauce based pesto pizza both times. Let me tell you this, they make the bestest pizzas. My son who is a picky toddler ended up eating 3 slices each time, that is a big win to me and a true testimony of the fact that the pizzas here send you on a pizza nirvana. I am taking away one star as when we went the second time the place was packed, we had to find a table that was not yet cleaned and had a pile of dirty dishes on it. The waiter kept asking us if it was our table, I insisted at least thrice that it was not our table and we were waiting to get that cleaned. Finally he cleaned it, so all is forgiven."}
{"text":"It like Pizza studio and blaze pizza where you choose the type of pizza you want. chipotle style ordering. it doesn't tasted as good as Blaze pizza and it's a little bit more expensive. The pizza pretty bland but the way they cook it pretty cool. it takes about a 3 minutes to cook in a open wooden fire."}
{"text":"My food rating is a 5 STAR 

CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A 3.

My husband and I travel to Vegas frequently and love every minute. We have seen 800 degrees several times but always in between meals or when we weren't hungry or had dinner plans. Just this past week when we walked past it was lunch time. We love that you can build your own pizza and salad. Our salad and pizza were DELICIOUS!!! 
We will 100% go back next time we are there. The girl at the cashier counter had zero personality and she rang me out and I wanted to split payments and she seemed so confused so instead of getting help or communicating ANYTHING with me she just screwed it up and never said sorry. When it finally got fixed the manager said he would give us free gelato which was kind. I just thought she was a bit rude however we will 100% go back for the food and hopefully the customer service will be better !!"}
{"text":"This is really an interesting concept. The idea of creating your pizza and getting it cooked (baked?) in 90 seconds is really amusing. 

I am a vegetarian and this turned out to be a great option as you have a couple of non meat options to choose from. You can control the amount of cheese so that you can enjoy a pizza with the taste of toppings and not have a cheese rush. 

They have nice toppings to choose from. The only thing missing is a selection of bell peppers. But there are many others to choose from. 

For the extra cautious vegetarian, they even have separate pizza cutters for vegetarian and non vegetarian pizzas. 

The downside is the lack of beverage options. They boast that they have over 150 coke products, but people are trying to avoid them now a days. So some other options will be appreciated. 

The salad bar lacked some ingredients and dressing choices as well IMO. 

Overall, a nice and quick option on the strip."}
{"text":"Good pizza and they have big water cups which is key because the desert is is trying to kill you and it is nearly impossible to drink enough. Downside is that all extras are $1.50 each. Even for a few pepperoncinis. I had the Verde which was good."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! We ate there everyday for lunch. Everyone that worked there while we were there were super nice and helpful.

The food was great!--we discovered on Instagram that they have a secret \"Pie of the Day\". The guy told us that they have a machine that randomly spits out ingredients, and that's the pie of the day...best part: It's HALF OFF!! Sure, we ate a pizza with corn on it, but come on...half off!:)

Ingredients were fresh, it was fast, and they have a great outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"Pizzas were perfect.  The service was quick.  Enough said.  Would suggest the specialty pizzas they are creative twists in traditional."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, though the thin crust got soggy quickly.  The thick crust might be the way to go, if you can handle all that dough.

We had the quattro formagio on thin crust, and it was one of the best 4 cheese pizzas i've eaten.  Sauce was good, cheese was great quality.  Only quibble is about that crust - i like my cracker thin and crispy!

Service was reasonably quick and polite, maybe a bit better than we experienced other places in a tourist oriented town.  One pizza fed 2 of us quite satisfactorily."}
{"text":"Loved the food at 800 Degrees!  So many choices of yummy food.  The atmosphere was great, plenty of seating for all the customers.  I highly recommend 800 Degrees."}
{"text":"My other love besides breakfast is pizza. 

So, we had this as a light lunch because the boo and I split the pizza after a day out by the pool. It was very tastey. If you're staying at the monte carlo, having a pizza place just down stairs is a very nice convenience. I did not go down with the S.O. to buy it but he came back within 20-30 minutes with a Margherita pizza and he added ham to it. 

Some people may not like the softness of the bread because it was thin and could have been toastier but I still found it to be delicous. You could taste how fresh it is with each bite. I could have easily eaten the whole thing by myself."}
{"text":"Meatballs were bland. Asked for our pizza to be crispy (shouldn't it always be, if it's thin crust?) but it came out as a soggy mess."}
{"text":"If you're looking for pizza, this is not the spot. Too expensive for the ass tasting food. No nutrition and very not macro friendly. This place is shit."}
{"text":"Just finished eating a delicious pizza at 800 degrees. It's just as good as the Los Angeles location, but with a Vegas flavor to it. The margarita pizza is scrumptious and if you love tomatoes try the margarita doc pizza . By far my favorite Bianca pizza.  It will not disappoint ."}
{"text":"Decent pizza, fresh ingredients, great for when you have been all day at a conference and all you want to do is grab something to go."}
{"text":"My first thoughts whenever I go somewhere is food. I think \"mmm Las Vegas what should I eat?\" Once I got there I decided why eat something like seafood in the middle of the desert when I live in the most amazing State and area there is for seafood. So the hunt was on for something tasty and inexpensive.
I like the concept of this restaurant. It's almost cafeteria like or Panda Express'ish. It turned out to be a little expensive for my taste as it was a dollar fifty for a small handful of a topping & I'm talking mushroom & onion a dollar fifty each. The salad that I chose is a chopped salad with chunks of meat: salami, pepperoni, ham & such, along with a little cheese & chopped peppercinis and a really good oregano vinaigrette. All in all it was a nice meal the total came to $29 and that included a small pizza the one chopped salad which was enough for two people & 1 soda that cost $4.00!
As they left the place I thought; I could open one of these in Ventura County after I retire.

I originally did my check-in at the wrong location. This review is for the one I actually went to. I'm sure they're all very similar anyway!"}
{"text":"I've been to the one in Santa Monica, and this one in Vegas met my expectations. Fast and courteous people who seem pretty passionate about pizza. Ingredients are superb and the location is prime with the amount of drunkies walking around the strip.  I'd come here again"}
{"text":"I'd give this place 3.5/5 stars actually. Wasn't amazed, but it wasn't terrible. Salads are really good though! Got the sausage and peppers pizza- toppings were awesome, just not a fan of the sauce. Not too bad on pricing either. I like the concept of building your own pizza, and how quick it is!"}
{"text":"What can I say. Pizza and a salad. They do a great job with it. I have tried it before in Westwood once and it was just as good as I remember."}
{"text":"I wouldn't call myself your standard pizza fan so take my content how you will...

Thick gooey cheesy gobby pizza with tons of tomato sauce and thick crust is just not my thing.. I'm into a more light crunch, delectable, high end type of pizza. Maybe pizza regulars don't like that, but I do. And this hit a home run on my spot

I custom ordered my pizza with pepperoni, arugula, anchovies and mozzarella. They tend to skimp on all the ingredients, including the crust being thin... But the quality, damn, the quality is real. The flavor is masterful and the oil brushed on top is intensely pure. Don't forget the dash of salt that is savory

I loved this pizza and will be back again"}
{"text":"This place is a must stop when ever we are in Las Vegas. Great food, great service, great prices! Fresh ingredients, helpful staff, the bomb.com! We never go to Las Vegas without stopping here. The choices are endless. The crust is thin and crispy, The toppings are top shelf. If you're looking for great pizza at a great price there is nothing better than 800Â°."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool concept pizza joint, albeit not incredibly original. When my wife and I arrived, the man shaping the dough greeted us and had some small talk. The ordering process was smooth and fairly uneventful. The menu is simple and that's suiting to a place like this. You don't want to over complicate a place like this because of the way orders are placed. 

We ended up going with the Verde (pesto) base with extra garlic, oregano, smoked gouda, pepperoni, and chicken. The process was speedy and we had paid and got our drinks pretty quickly. By the time we got to our seat, our pizza was done. Nice and quick. 

My first impression was that, due to such high temperatures, the crust can get a little too done in spots. However, that didn't really bother me. The crust was good and the toppings were pretty good, too. The pesto base was about right, but the pizza overall was a bit heavy on the olive oil. The reason for this is because pesto is made with olive oil and then they also put more olive oil on the pizza after all toppings are on. I think they do this with all pizzas, but for a pizza with a pesto base, this is unnecessary. 

That all being said, my wife and I still enjoyed the pizza and would not hesitate to go back. The speed of service is excellent and the price is one of the better deals on the strip, in my opinion. Next time I'll just ask them to hold the extra oil."}
{"text":"Amazing, we decided to order something we would never try at home, got a pizza made with anchovies, capers and shrimp, no cheese... yum yum yum, will eat there again!"}
{"text":"Delicious Pizza!  Freshly made right there in front of you and they have beer!  You can sit outside and enjoy the sun on the strip while eating.  We got the pineapple and ham pizza and it had GREAT flavor!"}
{"text":"Horrible service- dirty tables- i had to clean my own table- ordered pizza- charged me for extra sauce when I noticed it wasnt enough- NO OLIVES - Whats a pizza joint with no olives-Ordered  broccolini it was tasteless-they put a ton of spicy  flakes and it was under cooked-chopped salad was terrible- never will eat there again."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! Since a few of our other favorite pizza places closed, this is now our favorite go-to pizza joint. Even though its on the strip, its not that expensive and the pizza is just so incredibly tasty! Also their salads are great - a small portion is still enough to share between two. Wish their were more branches of this place in town."}
{"text":"Don't see how anyone can give this anything less than 5 stars. Its amazing pizza, cooked quickly and with a great price. Its nice to sit and people watch as the restaurant looks out over the casino. Such fresh tasting ingredients, and open 24 hours also which is great for 'life' nightclub visitors."}
{"text":"First timer at this pizzeria and I enjoyed it! Food was quick and delicious and although no one really helped me with how things work as far as ordering goes at the place but  when I did ask a lot of questions the staff members were all attentive. I got myself a Magherita Pizza and added half with anchoives and the other half with roasted garlic and prosciutto and topped it with arugula all over. They were quick with baking the pie and the portion size was very generous. No doubt that I will go back to grub again."}
{"text":"I am surprised that the rating isn't higher for this place. I thought the pizza was really good... it's made to order and comes out within minutes. It seemed very efficient to me and it served its purpose. Given it's based on speed, I don't expect it to be the most amazing atmosphere but it's nice and clean and that's all I could ask for."}
{"text":"Yuck. I had a pepperoni pizza that was soggy and wet.  My whole pizza literally fell apart because the crust was so wet. The flavor was so-so. They were very stingy with the amount of pepperonis. I would say there were about six on the entire pizza."}
{"text":"Great for sharing a pizza and salad for a good price. We ate lunch here twice when visiting Vegas. Delicious pizza!"}
{"text":"Chipotle meets pizza!
Fresh ingredients, outstanding service, and great tasting pizza!
If you're looking for a great meal on the Las Vegas strip that won't leave a dent in your wallet, try 800 Degrees!

Btw, It sits directly on the Las Vegas Blvd!"}
{"text":"We came for the wood fired pizza and because they offered a gluten free crust for my wife, who suffers from celiac. It's a build your own pizza place- lots of toppings to choose from along with real mozzarella cheese. Once you order your pizza is ready in 5-6 minutes. We were very pleased- so much so that we are here twice in the week we were in town. I'd definitely recommend it for an evening when you're looking for a less fancy but good meal."}
{"text":"I came here to have lunch with my boyfriend. We ordered cheese pizza with sausage and a Caesar salad. I'm not really a fan of Margherita pizza  and the mozzarella didn't cover all of the sauce, so I asked for some more graded cheese. I don't know if the graded cheese was the cause, but our entire pizza fell apart. The crust was edible and delicious, and this place has potential to be the new custom built, considering it's closing, but ALL of the cheese fell off, and the crust under the cheese seemed half cooked. It was very greasy and soggy other than the crust :("}
{"text":"I ate there with my girlfriend. She got a red sauce pizza, and I got a truffle something-or-other. We were both very pleased with the experience and the flavors. Fast and friendly with great options. The price wasn't bad either for being where it is."}
{"text":"Pizza is great. Server Catherine also made the experience extra fun, was very concerned about my concerns on how to optimize my customized pizza. Much thanks!"}
{"text":"Quick.. edible.. and i am sure I would try it again.. endless combinations."}
{"text":"That wasn't too exciting. This was for sure the soggiest pizza I ever had in my life. I can say for sure that the pizza I make at home is far superior to this thing. The service was also quite chaotic and you felt a bit lost as a customer. I had such high hopes for this place. *sigh*"}
{"text":"So I found 800 Degree online and read other Yelp reviews and wanted to try it out..For the quality and the price...It's hard to find affordable food on the Strip..Everything is marked up a few bucks! I liked that you can make your own pizza from scratch...You are able to pick the crust and sauce and then load up on a variety of ingredients but..If you're trying to save money...I would suggest to just pick a couple...I went with a family member and bought one pizza for starters thinking it could be enough! Wrong!! If you are not hungry maybe! It cost about $15 with one drink..I recommend you sit outside if you love the buzz of the city and to people watch...They have one of the best locations to be amongst all the action Las Vegas has to offer...( They have tables inside as well ) The pizza was delicious..I love that it is ready in just a few minutes and comes out the brick oven super hot! Umm! #Yummy The crust was extremely thin..So won't fill you up right away...This is why we bought a second...I will definitely go back again and try other varieties of their pizza and update my review...Update: I did go back and loved them more the second time around...Loved that they have very friendly workers..I really appreciate it...When people love their job and loved that my pizza was ready in record time and super hot and delish!! I will visit again real soon!!*"}
{"text":"More like three and a half but my lack of enthusiasm for the pizza may have just meant it needed another ingredient?   The salad was fresh and good though.   Would like to see salt and cheese ON the table..."}
{"text":"Everything on the strip cost a lot more than anywhere else in Vegas, the rent must be sky high. For a quick fix to the munchies and when you need it fast, this is a great place to go to. Order exactly what you want and how much you want and within 15 minutes your special pizza is done, yum just the way I like it."}
{"text":"Best pizza place ever.

You walk through an assembly line where they throw your pizza together from a buffet of ingredient.  They all looked fresh and super weird.  You want oregano, they're shaking a bush on your pizza.

Once you get to the front of the line, they throw your pizza in a 800 degree brick oven pizza for 90 seconds.  It is amazing how quickly they move the line through, but even more amazing how great the pizza is when you get it."}
{"text":"I've never had a pizza that falls apart from the center as you pick up a slice. The quality of the veggies and outer crust was good, but the heart and soul of the pizza (the center with the yummy toppings) was a disaster that couldn't be eaten unless you like to spoon your pizza off the box. Gross!!

They get 2 stars for making the pizza look/smell good, having good service and a decent salad.

No I won't be giving them a second try."}
{"text":"Pizza was on point but be ready to pay the high end price. The verde was delightful and gently eased my tastebuds into ecstasy. The accoutrements were bacon, chicken and sun dried tomatoes and they further pushed the buds into an orgasmic state when combined. The street parking is not good and the toilet is suited for a middle class mid evil lord."}
{"text":"The new crispy crust (the hand-tossed thick is still available) completely solves the issues with the soggy middle.

Finally, a slice that can be held in your hand from the first bite!

Combined with the fresh ingredients and the toppings added while you wait, 800 Degrees is now as close to a perfect pizza experience as you can get while sitting on the strip.

And the staff here continues to be friendly and knowledgeable about their pizzas.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"So after walking the strip we were hungry, walked in and almost walked out. The bad about this place is that it's not cheap and there are a few things they didn't have that I really wanted like a BBQ chicken pizza. The good about this place is that everything we did order was Yummy? I custom made a pesto pizza that I think was the best ever. My kids god a sausage pizza and then we got a salad and some drinks. Everything is custom made and it's very fresh. I highly recommend this pmace?"}
{"text":"Expensive and low quality pizza. Would not recommend this place. My kids thought it tasted like the pizza they get at their school cafeteria.  We shared 3 pizzas for 2 adults and 3 kids for $50 and left hungry.  An adult male can easily eat a whole pie. Sodas are $4 each which we bypassed.  Expensive toppings that are frugally allocated. Not a good buy for your money."}
{"text":"This place is great when you want really good pizza that doesn't weigh you down. The salad is also fantastic."}

{"text":"Best pizza ever! Was really excited they have vegan options.. The dough is perfect, lots of add on's price is fair.. I only wish they were open at 4am after the party is over!!"}
{"text":"The single worst pizza I've ever had in my life!  (See photos).  It was impossible to eat, and I can't believe a restaurant would serve what they did.  Seriously, when this place is closed soon, I will not be surprised.

The first warning sign:  There were only 4 customers in the entire restaurant when we walked in.  There were 11 people behind the counter working.  It was weird... they were all kind of just standing around, and a few of them were just watching others work.  Restaurants that aren't busy (and are empty) are usually like that for a reason.  We soon learned why.

The pizza I ordered was a pepperoni, olive & pineapple.  The woman making it was nice, but I have to admit the pizza didn't even look all that great when it was being made.  She used very few ingredients, it seemed.  For roughly $15 for a personal size pizza, it seemed average at best while it was being made.

I got to the cash register to pay, and a new cashier was being trained that day.  It took quite a bit longer than I expected.  As I looked around, I'm thinking now that maybe even the cooks and prep people were being trained as well.  There were what appeared to be a few managers just standing around watching them like a hawk.  It was odd.  Three months into a new restaurant, I would've expected things to be running smoother.

The pizza arrived.  The edges were black on the crust and I like them that way.  However, a closer glance revealed that the entire interior of the pizza was either undercooked or uncooked.  Picking up the first slice, it was clear that the thing was a complete mess.  The entire pizza toppings slid off, including cheese and everything.  I was left holding a wet piece of literally uncooked dough with some tomato sauce.  It was a rubbery mess and the entire middle of the pizza was drowned in wetness and was more of a soup than a pizza!  The whole thing was gooey, wet and runny.  The crust was so thin and undone that it was a drooping disaster.  Each slice was like that:  watery, dripping, and unable to even stand up like a normal pizza slice.  

It was inedible.  Before I left, I scooped some of the soup-like toppings on a fork, and it didn't even taste good.  The crust had no flavor at all.  I will never be back, and would implore anyone reading this to think twice about ever stepping foot in this place.  There's a reason it ended up on one of the lower-end Vegas properties like Monte Carlo rather than someplace like the Cosmopolitan, Aria or Caesar's Palace.

Eat at this place at your own peril.  I'd give it zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"Out of all the Chipotle style pizza places, 800 degrees is probably my favorite. They have way better gourmet toppings than Blaze Pizza and Pieology. I ordered the sausage & peppers pizza here. I loved the flavor of the peppadew peppers, sweet and tangy. It paired nicely with the sausage and caramelized onions. My only gripe was that the center of the pizza was a bit soggy, as other yelpers have mentioned. Other than that, it was a good quick bite."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST pizza I've ever eaten. We visited Vegas for Christmas and NYE and I think we ate there about 4 times over our 3 weeks! The crust is incredible...the toppings so fresh and the cheese!!   Sooooo good!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"In a casino... and not open 24/7?!?! Drunk humans LOVE pizza!!! Why don't you at least extend the hours?"}
{"text":"Just average. There are a lot of great toppings to choose from and the workers are attentive and nice. The one downside...the crust. The crust is a bit like cardboard or a store bought Bobali crust. While the pizza comes out quick, and I enjoyed the plethora of toppings, I couldn't get over the crust. I'll come back when I'm too drunk to walk farther for better pizza, but I wouldn't eat here if I wasn't heavily intoxicated and in dire need of food to soak it up. I appreciate the toppings, though. 5 stars for toppings, 1 star for crust. Too bad for 800 Degrees I love the crust."}
{"text":"Not easy finding great pizza these days...so much mediocrity!!  Not at 800 Degrees. All the right ingredients...top notch crust...cooked perfectly. If you're on the strip and want to experience great pizza...this is it!!"}
{"text":"PEET-SUH!!

Situated along Las Vegas Blvd right at the front of Monte Carlo Casino, this is a great pit stop for quick lunch/dinner while strolling  around the area.

I like how you get to customize any pizza as the staff whips it up.  I say start off with Margherita and pile it up with desired toppings.  Being a NYC pizza fan, I prefer picking up and folding my pizzas in half.  Unfortunately, this is not the case for Neopolitan pizza as they're quite thin and soggy; we were even adviced to use silverware instead of picking it up.  Nonetheless, the crust was tasty and ingredients were fresh.

Due to its location, a pint of beer costs $9 which I succumbed to since theres really nothing better than washing down amazing pizza with a cold glass of Moretti.

Overall, 800 Degrees Pizza has delicious pizzas and superb customer service.  As a local, I probably won't come back as often especially since Settebello is just right around my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Make your own pizza or order one!! You can make your own pizza and add any toppings on it. Pizza is pretty good and very light. I would definitely come back here!!!"}
{"text":"Since I'm staying here at SLS, it's 4:30 why drive the strip for Grimaldi's or Giordanos!!!! So we sauntered into the pizza place, waited for ten minutes with all the employees just doing things but not asking us to order, weird! Ordered totofu, lots of white cheese, with oily garlic, an assortment of mushrooms, and arugula. Beautiful, But didn't tastes delicious. Was super fresh and oven baked. Beautiful ambiance, like soda pop fountain!! The cashier said he'd bring it out to us, but the other guy just yelled out our number!!! He must have been too busy!! They even have fresh gelato!! I was alittle sticker shocked when the bill was $39 for two pizzas!!"}
{"text":"I thought this was a good spot for a pizza hit, and the DIY ordering means it satisfies the fussiest of eaters and allergies!
You can watch them make the dough fresh for you which just seemed to make it taste that little bit better somehow, and I liked that it wasn't too heavy. They have a number of suggested pizza classics or you can go off piste and create your own entirely - which my sister and I ended up doing as the list of ingredients was just too inviting.
We split a pizza and a salad half each - and were impressed at how huge the salad portion was. We also liked being able to add things like pepper and chilli flakes ourselves at the condiments counter - ok clearly we got carried away by the novelty factor given we don't have anything like this in the UK!
I thought the prices might've been a little cheaper given you're not paying for service, but I guess it's in a prime strip location and still a solid choice for a chilled group eat (and beer)."}
{"text":"This pizza was actually good, the problem is with the service. We got a margarita pizza and I watched this guy put spoiled basil leaves on my pizza while making it. I called him out and he changed them out. He also forgot the Parmesan. I called him out and he added it. No apology either time. The lady at the table next to us got the kale salad to which she realized was summer mix. She went to talk to them and they told her they ran out of Kale. They hadn't t bothered to tell her and still charged her the higher price. We got the pizza and beer special for $10.95 but our total was $14. I think that is because they gave us an option of beers and we must have picked a more expensive one and they upcharged is without informing us. Good pizza, crappy staff. And it was three different staff members, different ones for each of the issues, so it is a while team problem, not just one rogue bad apple."}
{"text":"Went in for our last meal before the flight home. I was surprised they do a subway style build your pizza, I didn't think something fresh and yummy could be done so quickly. The service was fast and everyone was friendly. My favorite thing was probably the wads of mozzarella they put on the pizza, extremely good and I would say worth the price. I would recommend this as a quick bite to eat with a casual dress code."}
{"text":"Pizza was very soggy and seemed like it was undercooked. I'm sure that's the taste they're going for since all 4 pizzas came out like that. I asked the others in our group and they said they would not come back and I agree. 

Aside from the wet toppings sliding off your pizza everything else was good. The toppings were cooked and tasted great. The pizza line staff was friendly.  

Bottom line:  find another pizza joint unless you like the wet soupy pizza taste."}
{"text":"muy first time and the last one... we  were walking at night and we were looking for food, when we saw this restaurant where you can created you own pizza... I was ordering my  pizza and they didn't have the ingredients which they have in the menu, the service was bad, the pizza wasn't crispy,  it was soggy,  didn't like the flavor, and the last part, we were sitting outside and they closed the doors without saying anything! oh!!... and it was expensive!!!!!.. $42 for 2 mini pizzas and 1 soda!!!!..."}
{"text":"Probably the best restaurant in SLS but just can't get over how expensive this place is. Definitely $20+ for a personal-sized pizza and drink. Don't make a special trip but if you're at SLS and need something to eat, head here."}
{"text":"Great little pizza place in front of the monte Carlo. It's quick and easy. Pizzas range from $7-$15"}
{"text":"Local Las Vegas resident. My gal and I thought we'd stop by and see what this place was like. Upon entering it looks and feels like a Subway or cafeteria, but without the clarity. you order a base pizza, which I got the Verde (pesto). Dough looked good and ingredients looks fresh. Staff was ok, but not inviting or helpful. You have to remember that EVERYTHING you put on this pizza will cost you 1.50 each, which adds up quick. I don't mean just meats or cheeses, but even veggies of any sort. Puts them below Subway in my eyes at this point.
Anyways, it was expensive. They put the pizza in the oven and you wait. Took a while, but not agonizingly long. Pizza was oily, greasy, paper thin crust, which I like, but only if it can hold itself up. It's limp and everything just slips right off and your left with a limp piece of dough and eating your toppings with a fork. Pizza wasn't cut thoroughly either. My gal's pizza was given to someone else and had to wait to get another, and it was even worse than mine.
Anyways, 2 stars for having good ingredients, but everything pretty well is below standard."}
{"text":"I'm not a pizza snob, but this pizza was one of the best I've ever had! You get to choose something traditional or you can create your own. 

I was really surprised at the size and taste because it was inexpensive. 

You see the guy rolling the dough when you order and you see it go into the brick oven. It didn't even take long to cook, and it was delicious. 

If I lived in Vegas, I'd become a regular there."}
{"text":"I had good Neapolitan pizza here. The Verde with extra mushrooms came out great. You can build your own or select from their menu on the wall. The concept is simple but it works in the end. I enjoyed my pizza here."}
{"text":"The Skinny: fall apart pies with soggy middles and really odd tasting Caesar salad(2) service: counter service...make sure they give you a ticket after you order your pizza and salad. They missed our salad so we had to wait to get it. (2), value: although the ingredients are good, the crust just doesn't hold up. Throw in a horrible Caesar, I'd pass on this place. (2)

FYI- they serve Pepsi products here in a sleek, small digital soda machine.

This joint tries to make thin crust Settobello-type pizza in a counter service environment. You line up at the pizza making line, design your masterpiece or choose a specialty pie, order your salad/appetizers. After that, they print you a ticket which you give to the register. At the register, you order your drinks and wait for your order to be fired. They call your number when the pizza is ready. 

They have water cups, small plates, utensils, napkins and small boxes for leftovers on a side counter where you help yourself.

This is the type of pizza that doesn't hold up well so be aware and eat it at the restaurant and do not get it to go.

The hubs wanted to create his own pizza and I warned him not to go overboard with ingredients. Like 2 toppings is probably the maximum you want to get. He insisted on the marinara (all sauce with garlic and oregano) with ricotta, sausage and mushroom. As the pizza maker loaded the pizza with 2 large scoops of sauce, this was a disaster in the making. The pizza was horribly soggy in the middle while the garlic was not evenly distributed in the pizza so you ended up with mouthful of garlic. The sausage and mushrooms were bland too. Textural violation number 1 of the night.

Okay, shame on us for making a bad pizza. 

But for the Tartufo, I expected them to make a quality product as it is their specialty pie. Again, terribly soggy pizza, greasy as hell from the excess amount of olive oil - literally dripping down my hand as I am trying to eat it. There are too much toppings for such a thin crust and it totally does not hold up. Ugh! Textural violation number 2 of the night. Flavorwise, this one was okay but nothing special. The truffle was a bit understated while eating the pizza.

There are 2 problems because the pizzas were fired correctly (anymore, the crust would be burnt). Either the crust is the issue or it is too much toppings. My vote goes to the amount of toppings because the edge of the crust was fine.

The Caesar was horrible. Probably the worst Caesar I've had in a long time. There was a very weird fruity aroma that permeated throughout the salad. I think maybe it is the type of cheese they used. Or maybe some other elements from another salad got mixed in. Whatever it was, it was very off putting. I didn't taste any garlic or anchovies in the dressing at all. The red leaf lettuce they threw in became limp quickly from the acidity of the dressing and having too much dressing. Textural violation number 3 -it's a hat trick!

End of the story, I am glad we got to try it as a half priced local deal. Full price I would have been mad. Skip this joint. You can get better quality pizza and salad elsewhere for a better value. (2 starred review)"}
{"text":"Really the worst pizza I ever had. A flat limp mushy pizza. They did not have 3 toppings that I wanted , and then wanted to charge $3.00 for a little goat cheese. Never again. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Super quick place to grab some pizza at SLS.  We ordered the Carni (I think that's the name of the meat pizza) and it was enough for two to share for lunch.  Depending on your appetite, you may want to get your own.  The pizza was made in a couple of minutes and the free gelato with a Yelp checkin was a great ending!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE AND THIS PIZZA!  I always create my own of the Pesto Sauce, Sausage, Pine Nuts (Extra Pine Nuts), with Fresh Mozzarella Cheese and Parmesan Cheese.  The only problem I have is there is not one across the street from where I live!  Priced well for the quality of food you receive and there is always extra to take home, but truthfully I have to make the effort not to eat the entire pie in one sitting!

Tell them Chef Sandra sent you"}
{"text":"So this place was recommended to us by a lot of ppl that were staying at the hotel. Apparently it was called 800 degree because they literally cook the pizza for 60 seconds at 800 degree. We order two pizza from their one that was all veggies and the other one was pepperoni and sausage. Seem like the pizza should have been cooking a little longer since the cheese was not completely melted and the meat pizza had so much oil. The only good thing about this place was because it was located inside the hotel the convenient of getting food was great."}
{"text":"Started out really great. I asked for a very well done pizza I made sure to tell more than one person so my order was correct.  Once I finally got my pizza it game out very underdone and extremely soggy. I could see this from just taking one look at my pizza. When I asked if they could cook my pizza more I was told \"we don't do well done pizzas\". Also they were very rude when I asked to talk to the manager about the situation. All together this was a terrible experience for me and I will NOT return... very disappointed."}
{"text":"Quick personal pizza made from quality ingredients.  The toppings are a minimum of $1.50 each, which is pretty high for a few slice of fresh jalapeno or a sprinkling of onions.  

Small selection of wines and beers.  I got a small glass of Pinot Noir that accompanied the pizza perfectly.  

Very nice place to stop for a bite."}
{"text":"Wow I did not think it could be that bad but it is. I got a margarita and the pizza has not taste despite supposedly having fresh mozzarella, basil, tomatoes sauce on it. I taste bread and salt. The sauce is watered down and runny. The cheese is lunpy and inconsistent additional toppings are a 1.50. I am glad I got none. Well I guess I will keep the pizza for my am
Hangover. 

It has two stars for the staff and free gelato."}
{"text":"This is my first time at an 800 Degrees and I was impressed. The concept of completely custom fast casual Neapolitan pizza is really great. We enjoyed our selection along with the baked goat cheese side. 

I read some reviews before we came and noticed some complaints about the employees speed and I did notice this with the person placing toppings on the pizzas. However, as a skilled home cook I would say that I would rather someone take their time placing ingredients on a smaller pizza rather than quickly throwing them around. 

I took off a star because when we went at 4:00pm they were not busy at all and almost all tables had crumbs and many had not been bused, nor had the messy condiment counter been cleaned up in a while."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has a poor rating cause it is super good and authentic tasting. The simplicity of their recipes and the options to add toppings is simple and desirable. Plus you can't beat the local discount! Half off til December 23rd with local ID and players card! 

My boyfriend order the margarita pizza and loved it! I ordered the Porchetta with additional mushrooms  and it was delicious. The setup and order process was very easy, chipotle style ordering. 

The environment is pretty chill and casual. Your usual pizza spot vibe. They even have gelato for dessert to order if u like! I can't tell you enough the dough they used is freaking amazing. That's if u like the soft crust pizza. They aren't greedy with their toppings either. 

The service is pretty fast too. I would say one pizza is good for one person. It's nice to share too when your boyfriend orders a different one too! Haha definitely reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The stars are for the taste of the pizza, it was absolutely delirious! Make sure to ask for more cheese though because they don't put a lot on their own. I would have given it 5 stars but the prices are pretty crazy. It's like $10 for a cheese pizza and then $1.50 for every topping after that! 

Other than the prices , pizza is delicious! 12\" pizza with 6 slices!"}
{"text":"Place is pizza heaven and very customizable it  can have you flustered with the variety of toppings you can get. All good quality. Stayed in Vegas for a week and have been here twice."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever. I love how the guys took care of me they did an awesome job. Had the Carni with Calabrian chiles as the base best tasting pie I've ever had"}
{"text":"Not sure what the bad reviews are about.  Maybe bad timing.  All dishes were awesome.  Even amongst the rush.  Doppio Pepperoni, BLT, meatballs and spicy feta garlic bread...all excellent."}
{"text":"It is a cool experience but the pizza... I have had better. Much better. The pizza is very soggy with a puddle of fluid at the base. We retuned one and asked for it to get crispy and we got it back burned."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm a pizza snob or this pizza is just underwhelming. Sauce is thin and a little tangy, the dough is burnt and the soda machine had no ice. 

Horrible service, yes, I know it's fast casual but the line order cooks are short and rude the tables are dirty.

Eat somewhere else, $4.00 small sodas was the straw on the camels back."}
{"text":"Seemed a little disorganized....had 3 people ask me what I wanted until someone actually placed my order. Pizza is pretty good for Vegas...but in NY they would be about average...tomatoes seemed to lack some flavor but still good."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, nothing fancy or anything but amazing-tasting pizza.
We got the spicy one - be warned! 

4 stars only because it's a bit expensive for the catering-style service you're getting"}
{"text":"800 Degrees Pizza is a \"gourmet\" version of places like Blaze Pizza where you are able to choose a basic foundation of your pizza then mix and match toppings all you want!  The ingredients are higher quality than a blaze - I chose the margarita base and added pepperoni.  They also have a Blanca base mad a pesto base.   If you prefer, there is a selection of preset pies and also salads.  The one thing to keep in mind, it gets expensive fast.  Each topping is an extra charge, which is different than blaze and some toppings (buffalo mozzarella) are even more!  

This isn't a 5 star joint because of the cost and also the location and very limited hours.   Service was OK, but they seem incredibly understaffed and a bit slow."}
{"text":"This is a build your own pizza place located inside SLS Hotel. It's a bit upscale, so prices are a bit higher than most casual pizza joints.

They make personal pizzas based on your order. Instead of pizza, I opted for a salad and breadsticks. Their standard breadsticks are covered in cheese and I asked if they could be made  without them. The chef asked what I wanted and made it right there. He was friendly and willing to work with me."}
{"text":"Tartufo on the specialty pizza menu is definitely the way to go! The crust is a little bland, but overall the pizza is still pretty good."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! Excellent gluten free crust available for a small extra fee. 

Got a pizza to go, and it was awesome.

Friendly staff, good quality ingredients, and a good size to share. This will be on my list of late night places to visit for a snack on future visits."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick bite and was pleasantly surprised by not only how delicious the pizza was but also how wonderful the crew was! In particular, Niko was friendly and patient and and funny and all around fantastic. Absolutely made our day!"}
{"text":"I will preface this review with service can certainly make a difference, but alas in the end can not save a meal. However, with what I review I feel I am fair and I leave it up to the yelper reading this to decide whether 800 degrees deserves a shot or if it should be essentially passed up..With that said \"eat up\" the following

Upon walking to 800 degrees (located on the right as you walk out of Monte Carlo towards the strip side) I pieced together that it does really have a subway feel to it and it's almost borderline cafeteria style preparation of the pizza which is nice because you won't get the \"chef special\"..=OP

The journey began with a gentleman who prepares and flips the dough..Onwards to the topping area where I do admit the ingredients for being \"out\" did seem to keep their freshness from an observational stand point at least..I had my heart sold on the tropicale (roasted pineapple, ham, and jalapenos), but I was the one left saying aloha in the end!

I took the pizza back to my hotel room and portion wise it is possible to share it amongst 2 people so there's a plus at least..Upon opening the pizza box I did find the crust to be paper thin and didn't seem to adjust well to being picked up as the toppings and sauce slipped right down and I was left with essentially a soggy piece of dough. It did look a bit heavy on the grease at the bottom of the box which attributed I'm sure to that. There was a sign by the register upon paying which did say they are willing to remake it if it falls short of your expectations so had I been closer I would have requested a re-fire of the meal so I can't knock them for that. In fact I do respect that they are willing to go that extra mile for the overall satisfaction of the customer if their product falls short of expectations.

I do have to comment on the staff as they were quite inviting and weren't pushy during the preparation. I think taste wise the experience would have been much different in house vs. my hotel room so I am open to giving it another shot and if it disappoints me in round 2 I will make the trek to project pie who at least for now blows them out of the water!"}
{"text":"Ordered a custom margarita style pizza with ground beef and butternut squash toppings. Two  unusual combination of toppings, but I wanted ground beef and my girlfriend wanted butternut squash so we got both.

The pizza was made fresh in the oven in front of us. The cheese and all the other ingredients were so fresh. Even tho it was a thin crust pizza, I could taste the thickness of he cheese (which I love). I really enjoyed the pizza, and it wasn't too expensive for hotel prices."}
{"text":"What's the fuss about? Soggy...dripping in oil...nothing crispy about the Pizza dough, massive line...I would never return to this particular location. I will consider trying the Pasadena one just to give this place a second chance :/"}
{"text":"They advertise gluten free pizza but dont actually keep it stocked. We came at 3pm one day and were turned away because they had no GF dough. That would be expected during rush hour perhaps but not in the middle of the day. We are disappointed by that this restaurant could not deliver on what it advertised. It resulted in us intending to come back."}
{"text":"800 degrees is in the new SLS hotel.

we checked in and were starving. we ordered two pizzas (pesto and meat lovers) and a salad to carry out and eat at the pool. the food was quick (considering they make it in a wood fired oven), delicious, and piping hot. a little on the pricier side for pizza but none of the food in the SLS is cheap. they packed it up really nicely with utensils and cups of parmesean and hot pepper sauce."}
{"text":"Expensive and not worth it. Crust is super soggy, and flavoring is bland. If you have to eat and have no other options sure, but I won't be coming back if I can help it."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced meal on the strip!
Pizza is made fresh to order. Self-serve beverages. You can build your own or select one of the chef's favorites. Done unique combos here. We had the doppio pepperoni and the zucca plus a Caesar salad. Salad was a little limp and skippable. The pizzas were a solid 4 stars! Yummy crusts and toppings were fresh. The doppio is a nice pepperoni pizza. For the zucca, my only complaint is the rosemary oil was a heavy so it felt too oily and the rosemary was quite strong. Loved the unique combo of bacon, butternut squash and caramelized onions though!"}
{"text":"Was not impressed.... pizza dough soggy, too much oregano, ended up being bitter, crust burnt on edges, 1.50 for extra toppings..."}
{"text":"Great pizza and salads and outstanding customer service (my wife has several food allergies and they really took great care of her - special thanks to Kat).  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had. Loved being able to customize my pie.  Took the left overs to the airport and would have been totally devastated if security took it away...lucky for me, they didn't."}
{"text":"All i wanted was a Margherita pizza.
This is the description: 
Crushed tomato, fresh mozzarella, parmigiano reggiano, olive oil, basil.
I got my pizza and opened it and NO basil! Isn't that like a third of the pizza??? I brought it back to the counter and asked them about it. Oh. They were OUT OF BASIL. Perhaps something they could have mentioned when I ORDERED! 
Plus the middle of the pizza was SO soggy you couldn't even hold the slice. 
Pathetic excuse for pizza!"}
{"text":"Pizza is one of my favorite foods. Amazing experience. It was so much fun to choose my own toppings, flavors, etc. The pesto sauce is delish. Like subway but with pizza. Excellent service, and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"So we loved loved loved this place.. but when we went back in August .. I cannot believe I spent 60 dollars on three pizzas when the whole staff were jerks and charged me for every little thing .. then get it back to our room and it's raw .. it's chewy it's gross omg they literally put my pizzas in for like 30 seconds and pulled them out .. I cannot even believe how awful we were treated and how lazy the employees were.. I'd rather order from a fast food chain than blow money here again .. unbelievable"}
{"text":"Came to this location twice in a 3 day Vegas bender. By bender I really mean a nice quiet stay on the strip, with my husband, to escape the Minnesota cold. We pick a different hotel every year. This time we stayed at Vdara Hotel and Spa, a quick monorail ride and some escalators later we found ourselves at Monte Carlo, home of 800 Degrees. Where the magic happens. 

When I think of my favorite pizza, I think of Punch Neapolitan Pizza in Minneapolis. Well let's just say, as I was eating, I feared that I had to move Punch down to the Number 2 spot. 800 Degrees has every single aspect of the perfect pizza, for me. Fresh ingredients that you can see and choose from, cooked in an alarmingly hot fire for about 2 minutes until it's done, put on a plate, sliced in front of you and handed over with a smile from one of the nice staff members. Quick, efficient, cheesy, and a fire burnt crust. 

The fact of the matter is my Margherita with pepperoni and gorgonzola was so damn good on our first visit that it made me come back on our last day for another pizza. This time I got the Margherita with feta cheese, kalamata olives and pepperoni. For some completely strange reason, I couldn't finish it, which almost never happens. I swear. The first pizza I almost inhaled and nearly got started on the plate. I attribute that to a long flight, and nothing to eat for 8 hours, a raging cold and sore throat, made me one cranky ravenous traveler. So on the last visit, I got a box to go, and had it for a late night snack high up in my Corner Suite on the 51st floor, where it had been resting in the fridge and waiting for the microwave. Yes, the Vdara is that awesome - all the rooms come with a full kitchen. 

Maybe next time we should stay at the Monte Carlo so I can be close to my pizza. I am infatuated with that damn pizza. But I still love you, Punch!"}
{"text":"Discusting lying place.  Was looking forward to their gluten free pizza, but guess what??? Their pizza is NOT gluten free.   They use same gloves and same oven AND the cheese is not gluten free and the tomato sauce is not gluten free. Customer service was horrible!!! They were not sorry or anything. The women who work here were laughing at my frustration!! I am calling corporation about this place.  I could of gotten very sick.  I decided to ask if specific things are gluten free and they we're all a no.  Take gluten free off the menu please, because it's a complete lie.  How inconsiderate of them to lie to the public."}
{"text":"I don't know how much I can say about this place.  It was your average good Neapolitan style pizza.  Cooked in an oven for about 7-8 minutes and served hot and fresh.

I got the Pollo which was Chicken, Carmelized Onion and Gorgonzola.  I added red sauce because it comes with nothing normally.  I recommend it!"}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza spot in vegas. Was quick, delicious and made up of fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple times (but wasn't able to check-in because I was out of data LOL). I've tried a lot of items on the menu including the Margherita Pizza, Marinara Pizza,Sausage & Peppers Pizza, and Spicy Meatball Pizza.

Of those I have to say that the Spicy Meatball and Sausage & Peppers pizzas are my favorite. I love spicy and they both provide the perfect amount :) I also really enjoy the option of the Marinara Pizza because it has no cheese and I'm lactose intolerant (sometimes I like to live dangerously, people), and it's a nice break from the stomach cramps LOL. I've also had the Gorgonzola and Caesar salads and they are AMAZING.

The prices aren't too bad. All pizzas come in the same size (gluten-free dough is available) and are about $12. They can feed two people about 3 slices each (big slices). 

The only down side is that the sauce makes the dough really soggy so when you pick up a slice it falls apart because the ingredients are also heavy. Other than that I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Okay so let's start with one thing. This is real pizza. They use real ingredients and not fake cheese like Pizza Hut. 

The cheese is stretches like a cheese is supposed to :)).

They use italian ingredients, the crust is amazing and they bake the pizza on 800 degrees in a woodfired owen. Basically the pizza is done in about a minute.

They make the pizza in front of you and you can even customize it. 
Additional toppings are $1.50 each.

The prices are decent and they have beer on tap and also bottled beer.

They do salads here and they make the best salad I have ever had!!

Definitely recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"It was definitely an experience... Some unusual toppings and interesting flavors, but we got 3 pizzas, and each one was an interesting mix of undercooked and burnt. For about $13 for a 10\" pizza, I'd rather eat at a Pizza Hut or similar chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Yes! This pizza was pretty good, and priced right for where we were. They make the pies fresh and use a really high quality sauce. Ordered the one that had a few different meats on it, and was surprised it was absolutely delicious. They give you a spicy chili sauce to add on top, as well as Parmesan cheese. The spicy sauce is very spicy, so try a little before you dump it on your pie. The service from the guy making the pizza was terrible, he was pretty rude and made it known we were the customers who were standing between him and his lunch break. The service at the register was great though. Also, they have one of those freestyle coke machines which is a plus. Would certainly come back."}
{"text":"Stopped in here as we had been walking past it all weekend. Exterior of building leads many to believe it is more of a \"sit-down\" type pizzeria. While there is seating, the concept is centered around fresh brick oven, create your own pizza. 

Ordered the base margarita pizza and truffle cheese bread. The staff was friendly and it was cool to see the pizza dough chucked into the air spinning. It did take about 20 minutes standing in line and other patrons were getting frustrated as it seemed like they were not operating like a well-oiled machine. 

Food reviews- Good thin pizza. Nothing mind blowing. Truffle cheese bread was more like a calzone stuffed with cheese and plenty of grease. Ordered for two people but cheese bread could easily serve 4-6. 

Worth a stop if you want pizza but better pizza for sure exists in Vegas."}
{"text":"Their pizza and salads are fast and delicious! I never have any complaints with their service."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place since they opened. Subway style ordering. One size crust. Traditional, cracker or gluten free. Usual sauces. We did traditional crust spicy meatball. It's ok. Nothing great. Sweet sauce. Not enough toppings. 800 degrees I'd expect it crisper. Also had prosciutto and melon burrata. Burrata very fresh and creamy. Nice portion of prosciutto but melon balls? Tasted pre done from a frozen bag. Lousy beer and wine selection. Cafeteria style seating. Not bad place just not for the price. You want good pricey pie hit five 50 at Aria. That's a pizza pie."}
{"text":"Items I tried:
- Sausage and peppers pizza
- Baby Kale salad 

800 degrees is located right off Las Vegas Blvd in front of the revamped entrance to the Monte Carlo Casino. 

I wanted a casual and quick place to have dinner while in town for business. Pizza looked good and I dropped in for a quick bite. 

The layout and large dining room make 800 degrees really inviting. Ordering is similar to Blaze Pizza where you either pick a pizza from their menu or build your own. Build your own comes with a base you select and each addition topping was $1.50. 

I went for the Sausage and Peppers for $14.95. Yes you read it right. That's quite expensive for a personal pizza with six slices, but this is Vegas mind you. 

The pizza was ok, it lacked sauce in my opinion. While the dough was nice and chewy I was expecting a nicer crunch on the bottom of the pizza that just wasn't there. I was let down to say the least. 

I also went with their Baby Kale salad for some greens in my diet. The salad was tossed in balsamic vinaigrette and topped with pine nuts, dried figs, and goat cheese. All this for $8 for the small size which was actually pretty big. 

I enjoyed the salad far more than the pizza honestly. However there were a few not so pleasing looking pieces of leafy greens that should have been picked out. 

800 degrees is a good spot if you must grab a quick bite and don't want to deal with a wait. But their are better options in terms of food quality and taste."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved 800 degrees!  I loved that their ingredients were fresh and you could customize your own pizza. My husband and I wish we had shared a pizza because they are quite large for one person after sharing a salad. The place is great for all types of groups including families, singles and date night. The only drawback is that we had wished our crust was a little crispier. When we ordered we had asked for the crispy thin crust and the guy making the dough said \"it's all thin crust.\"  He was wrong. Maybe he has never had crispy, thin crust pizza?"}
{"text":"I've been here on two separate trips to Vegas. The pizza is alright. Not great, but not bad either. The crust is thin so it can be cooked quickly. A bit pricey for a mediocre meal but compare to other places on the Strip, not too shabby. Good for quick bite."}
{"text":"This place is good!! Hard to beat; we got 2 pizzas with 3 toppings, and a large Greek salad for $30! The place is clean, right on the strip and finally there's a place to eat at that's not over priced!"}
{"text":"Good pizza. Fun atmosphere. We all liked the different signature pizzas. Didn't impress me where I would make it a high priority to go back but everything was good."}
{"text":"Really good thin chewy delicious crust. Excellent fresh ingredients. Really fast, pizza is ready seconds after you pay and get a drink. Plus, it's really inexpensive. Not inexpensive for the Strip, inexpensive for anywhere."}
{"text":"Another Social Sunday stop.  Popped in and got a couple pizzas to go.  There was a line that moved quickly.  We both opted for making our own pizza.  I got pesto, pepperoni, mushrooms and olives.  Hubbs got marinara, pepperoni and sausage.  Both pizzas were good and not soggy, even after the long ride home.  Mine was salty but it was my own fault.  I wasn't thinking.  The mushrooms were marinated, that plus the kalamata olives really put it over the top salty.  It was still good just a little much.  800 degrees is a good deal even without the discount."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular. Friendly service but mediocre pizza. Generally without much taste. Main ingredient is the dough as the extras you chose is so sparsely tossed you won't taste them. Quite a disappointment."}
{"text":"We were in vegas for the weekend and craved pizza. 800 degrees had a great menu and they were fantastic at accommodating one picky eater and two gluten free eaters. Amazing value for money, especially in vegas, and lots of great extras, like truffle salts hot pepper sauce. They also have wine and gelato so there is nothing wrong with that. Had a great time and will return."}
{"text":"Insanely good! 

Sausage and peppers pie. Added pepperoni  and whole garlic. Seriously fresh and one of the best pizzas I have ever had! 

They close at midnight, so make sure you get in before it's too late!

If you sit in the restaurant you can people watch like crazy! The Gogo dancers were jamming and you can see everyone going in and out of the Sayers club. As I'm typing this, some group just let out the loudest longest cheer at a game table. Gotta love Vegas and the crazy variety you get in food, people, and entertainment!

Definitely worth a stop I and if you are in the mood for something sweet, try the pistachio gelato. Awesomeness!"}
{"text":"I got the Doppio Pepperoni pizza and a small Greek Salad.  It was Great. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love 800 Degrees! We also have one in Santa Monica (my hometown) so I was excited to see there was one at the SLS hotel during my stay for a business trip. 

They're open late (4am) and serve beer & wine until 2am. The Yelp check-in includes free ice cream if you get a pizza! They have a variety of awesome flavors - I recommend the tiramisu. Their specialty pizzas are pretty good but I usually end up getting a standard margarita pizza. 

This is also the only late night place that serves dessert unless you want to go to another hotel. 

Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the world!!!! First thing you need to know... It's neopolitan pizza people! Don't listen to some of these other reviewers who clearly don't know what neopolitan means. The price is extremely fair. Margherita pizza for $7.95 and it was amazing!!! Add ons are $1.50 which is kinda steep. It's a build your own pizza bar pretty much. The interior is extraordinarily clean and the staff is exceptional. My bf and I stayed in Vegas for 4 days and ate here twice. I definitely recommend this joint!!! A little advice??? The pizza comes out a little thin do don't add on more than 3 items otherwise the dough will be overwhelmed."}
{"text":"great pizza with very fresh ingredients.  The wait is kind of long depending on when you go but worth it.  I went there 2 times on the short trip"}
{"text":"I loved their reasonably priced custom made thin crust pizzas. The burrata appetizer was also great. I'll definitely come back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I ordered the Bianca with pepperoni and it was amazing!!!  Prices were reasonable and service was very extremely friendly!  Especially once they realized it was my first visit. I will definitely recommend and will return soon!"}
{"text":"I'm a local, and live not far from SLS. The pizza and salad I enjoyed was really very good in quality. The experience was just taken down several notches by the disorganized staff and simply lengthy process getting the food. 

It's not all that obvious what you should do when you walk in. There's a couple of people making pizzas that logically looks like you might need to order there. The first register is apparently where you're supposed to order but you'd never know that until you're told. There was no staff member at the second register for a good 5 minutes and the beer I wanted was out.

Update Aug '16: I've been back. They've fixed most of the service issues. The pizza is still good."}
{"text":"Pros: employees are really nice and the pizza is done quick
Nice view of the strip 
Cool environment 

Cons: the pizza comes out burnt. I thought it was just my pizza but I could see everyone who picked up their slice, had black underneath the pizza. 
The drinks are insanely over priced, almost $5 for a regular drink! Have to pay for each topping

Overall it's ok pizza, nothing special but not worth the price and I don't like my pizza burnt."}
{"text":"Vegas is not really vegan friendly, so I was happy to read this place had vegan cheese option. Unfortunately they \"were out\". I opted for a margherita, no cheese with broccolini and roasted peppers. The dough and sauce were tasteless, the broccolini were boiled, with no oil or spices. \"Best Neapolitan pizza in US\"? Don't think so! If you want vegan, try the Indian place down the street!"}
{"text":"This place is the WORST! OMG. We ordered a thin crust pie and it came out soggy. It was impossible to even hold it up with one hand. The sauce is watery and overall the whole thing was just really disappointing. If you're in town and craving pizza this is not the spot. Hop on the monorail and get off at Harrahs/The Linq Station. Theres a pizza spot in the promenade that would be well worth the trek."}
{"text":"Looking for the best south of the strip? 800 degrees is probably what you're looking for. While it is not my personal favorite pizza, it is indeed actually good. It's different, and people love it.  

I did just get a basic pizza to try it out. It was a little more expensive than you would want it to be. You are paying for the quality tho because the dough is quite fresh, sauce good, and cheese good. I was most impressed by the crust actually, which is actually something that I am super picky about as someone who prefers thick crust pizza. 

It's exciting to see the 800 degrees brand expand from SoCal to multiple locations on the strip now. If you're in the SLS I promise it's a great option for a quick and easy eat!

My major problem is that I did have an 800 gift card, which the business could not process and therefore I had to pay with the little bit of gambling cash I had left. Really hope they fix their gift card system!"}
{"text":"Love their gluten free pizza! If you are allergic to wheat, you can feast on their delicious gluten free pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza is fabulous and the whole idea behind the restaurant is genius. It's like Subway meets gourmet pizza. You select the base for your pizza, then select all of the fresh toppings and then have it baked to perfection. Yummmm"}
{"text":"Meh.  Ok pizza. Similar to Sammy's or Yard House in  my opinion. I really want to love the SLS, but inconsistencies throughout drive me bonkers. One night excellent, next not so much. Base pizza is $7.65. Each topping was $1.50 per half (or i got ripped off). Ask questions before you order!"}
{"text":"Pricey. Employee in the bathroom for 15 min while 5 customers waited. Charged for 2 beers vs 1 I got. Food was cold before I resolved all that. Otherwise might be good. $100 for 4 pizzas and a salad. 2 beers 3 fountain drinks."}
{"text":"This place has the most awesome pizza ever. I come here at least twice a week. Sometimes twice in one night. I actually prefer their dough over any that I've had in Naples or anywhere else. Chewy and crispy at the same time. It's also great that you can get any pizza you want for a reasonable price. This place is straight out of eat, prey, love except the chicks at the sls are hot."}
{"text":"When you've been up for far too long and probably had one too many, what's better than a little carb-loading on pizza?  When that pizzeria is actually in your hotel - that's what.

Thing is - I think that quality suffers due to the extreme volume that these guys go through.  The assembly-line \"choose your ingredients\" was nice, but the finished pizza really should be left in the heavily-touted 800-degree wood-fired oven for a few minutes longer.  A droopy pizza just looks sad, and really took away from the experience.  On the other hand, the burrata and beets balsamic salad is a far fresher and better choice.

Expect this place to get packed, and enjoy it for the people-watching opportunity as well.  Just be sure to ask for your pie to be well-done."}
{"text":"I came to Vegas and the pizza was so damn good that this is the only place i ate at over the 3 days i was there. 2 of your employees were super awesome and definitely deserve some recognition. Jeremy made the dough for the pizza (which came out perfectly thin) and Evan had excellent customer service which made me laugh as i waited to be helped. These 2 guys are legendary and when i come back to Vegas i would definitely want them to help me again. the rest of the crew was good as well. pizza was insanely fresh tasting and for 10 dollars its the best price for good food on the strip. Thanks for multiple good experiences MATES!! 

From your Boy,

EZ"}
{"text":"I have so many problems with this restaurant. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WHATS EVEN WORSE IS THAT THEY ARE WAY OVER PRICED. UMMMM since when does 800 degree pizza charge $1.50 FOR EACH TOPPING ?!?!? The 800 degree pizza in California doesn't. Two personal pizzas came out to $40.00. You're better off ordering dominos. Also no one knew what the gluten free crust was made of. The person at the front who takes care of the crust left for a good 10 minutes to see where the gluten free crust was. Then the chick who took care of the second part of the station came back with the crust with the biggest attitude ever. I said I wanted onions and pointed to the caramelized ones and she threw raw onions on top. I corrected her and she started flicking the raw onions off and tossing them into the area where all the toppings were. The raw onions were landing in other toppings. God forbid someone has an allergy to onions. Moving on we get to the third section and the guy starts counting each toppings up. I was literally in shock and was like what the f***! I walked to the front of the line where nowhere in sight does it say each topping is $1.50 each. Seriously do not come here."}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere but the pizza is what pizza should be. The crust is perfectly charred, crispy yet chewy. The sauce is light but flavorful.  I'm in pizza heaven.

 Expect to pay about $20 for a pizza and a drink but it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"Very unorganized. Workers should just focus on one customer until moving onto the next. 

Ordered a margherita pizza with some extra toppings $1.50 extra each and it was ok, really nothing special."}
{"text":"I gave this place 4 stars because of the people. The pizza is just \"ok\" but the workers are sooo friendly and nice and made it worth it. I asked everyone about the pizza they said it was alright but their great friendly personalities made it a great experience for my weekend in Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious! Thin crust, fire oven build your own pizza style. I had a gluten free veggie pizza with goat cheese. It was amazing! Best gluten free pizza I've had in a long time. Super thin but great texture and flavor. My husband has the classic pepperoni with basil and he loved it! Great topping selection, can't go wrong. We will be back for sure! Right in front of the Monte Carlo on the strip."}
{"text":"Holy balls! This place is the Best pizza place I've eaten at in a long time! Everything is so fresh and so delicious I went here on vacation and I really wish there was one in my hometown! 10 out of 10 would recommend you will enjoy this place for sure!"}
{"text":"Good American pizza not true Italian but good enough for Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Burnt! My pizza was way too burnt both on the top and bottom. All I could taste was the burnt crust. They need to better train their staff to properly cook a pizza without burning it."}
{"text":"Their \"create your own pizza\" is pretty bs. You chose a pizza option and you are held hostage to the option even if you want to take ingredients off or if you're allergic to certain options. Very poor restaurant idea. Service is quite poor. Pizza is average."}
{"text":"It is like a more high class version of project pie in terms of restaurant structure. The pizza crust is very thin and the toppings slide off easily so you may need a fork and knife. It does taste very delicious and the service is very friendly. A slight bit over priced though."}
{"text":"Very tasty! Freshly made pizza and the oven actually IS 800 degrees lol. Had the Neapolitan crust with pesto, fresh mozz, parmesan, prosciutto, bacon and pepperoni. The entire crew there was also very friendly and happy to answer any questions we had. Set up like a Qdoba for pizza, all of the ingredients on display to pick or you can choose some preselected combinations. Right on the strip so fun to people watch while you eat outside."}
{"text":"I don't know why there are so many mixed reviews for this place -- I thought the pizza was absolutely delicious.  There are a lot of these \"chipotle style\" pizza places popping up, and I frequent a couple of them back home.  I have to say 800 degrees pizza was much better than the others I've had, mainly because the crust was doughier, while still being a thin crust, if that makes sense.  I chose the pesto pizza and added spinach an mushrooms on top.  I only chose two toppings mainly because they toppings are so expensive -- at most similar eateries, they don't charge for each individual topping.  Here, it's $1.50 for each topping, which is excessive.  Yes, it's vegas, but $1.50 for a handful of spinach is close to highway robbery.  However, the pizza was perfect with just a couple ingredients, so I can't complain too much.  This was my first time trying a pesto pizza and it was absolutely delicious! I think I'm addicted now. I liked it so much I made sure to go back a second time before leaving town."}
{"text":"This is how Neapolitan pizza is supposed to be. Great choice of toppings. Reasonable prices especially for Vegas. The burrata is awesome too."}
{"text":"This was the first place I ate in Vegas.
You can walk to it, it's close to NY, NY.
First, it was hot outside so... they had the door open...
Then you had to wait in line and choose a make your own pizza or speciality Pizza. I chose the Zucca with squash, rosemary, onion and bacon.
Everything was made well and it had fresh ingredients but this pizza really didn't have much flavor it was salty, greasy and tasted like rosemary.
I don't know what the other stuff tasted like but I would like to try pizza at other places."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!! But, the salad with lemon and oil had waaaay too much lemon, so it wasn't good."}
{"text":"As a fan of Neopolitan pizza, I was excited to have this option inside my host hotel (SLS).  I also needed something to give me a full stomach before going out for a night of old lady debauchery (which is more exciting than you think!).  As with most places, you can make your own pizza or select a specialty pizza. 

If I'd been feeling more experimental, I'd have tried the Verde base which is pesto sauce with mozzarella and parmigiano reggiano , but I went for the traditional margherita base with crushed tomatoes, mozzarella, olive oil and basil.  (There is also a white base and a no-cheese marinara base.)  From there, you select your toppings, and there are plenty to choose from.  I went with salami (they were out of soppressata *wail*) and peppadews (yum!)  The pizza cooks in seconds because of the thinness of the crust, and it came out hot and delicious!  It was a great portion size - about 10 inches, and I inhaled it.  It was just what I needed. 

Service was fast and friendly, and as a price point, it's Vegas and in a hotel, so it was $55 for three people to have their own pizza and a soda. 

Yelp 100 #14"}
{"text":"I love their pizza and to be specific I love the Margerita pizza! 
The dough the wooden oven with the fresh veggies makes it fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great place to get a pie!  

Because they cooks so fast, the line moves in a hurry.  The staff is knowledgeable and friendly - seems like a great combo!

Jump in line and choose your pie.  It's made up in front of you where you can add or subtract whatever topping you may want.  Speaking of which, the mozzarella is fresh, the toppings are locally sourced and it takes only a minute to make. 

We got two pies to go - we could have gotten one and shared - plenty of food for the price.  The toppings are good, but the crust is just okay.  I'll be back next time I stay nearby, but I wont long for it."}
{"text":"This pizza is awesome, definitely recommend if you are looking for something quick to sit down and eat. The pizza is a great price (for Vegas) and you could split it between 2 people as long as your not starving."}
{"text":"Soggy wet pizza. That's two 800 degree joints now that I have been to on the strip that have disappointed me. The other location being the franchise at SLS.

Service is friendly though. If you find yourself craving pizza at an late hour, come next door to Monte Carlo for some mediocre inexpensive pizza."}
{"text":"I have heard good stuff about the 800 Degrees franchise, but unfortunately my experience at this SLS 800 Degrees Neapolitian Pizzeria was sub par. 

I ordered the Hawaiian pizza from the man behind the counter. Fresh out of the oven, the pizza was wet and soggy. The crust was not crispy at all. I might give 800 Degrees another chance next time I am in Vegas, but as of now I am not impressed."}
{"text":"The only reason this place is worthy of one star is because they refunded our money. This pizza place is designed like a subway where you go down the line and chose your toppings. My boyfriend was first and the girl making his pizza was obviously new because she was going very slow, which was fine. So he made sure to patiently say exactly how he wanted his pizza and she was nice about accommodating. She just finished putting together his pizza when another employee took his pizza and said that he needed to give that pizza to another customer because theirs got ruined in the oven. My boyfriend specifically said no because she spent a long time making that pizza the way he wanted. They didn't care and still gave it to the other customer. We were very annoyed to say the least. After finally getting our pizza I lifted one piece and everything fell off, it wouldn't even stay up. I took a bite and it literally tasted like dough. It was slimy and not cooked all the way. I was extremely disappointed, but then it got worse. I noticed a large black hair cooked in my pizza! I almost vomited it was disgusting.  At that point I was completely grossed out and asked for my money back which they kindly did. Do not waste your money at this place. Go to 550 in Aria, a billion times better!"}
{"text":"Found ourselves in the SLS again and wanted to try something new. We missed the Ku Noodle special by 10 minutes so we decided to just grab a pie at 800 Degrees.

Prices are fair, considering location ($8.95-$9.95) for your pie, with each additional topping running extra($1.00-$1.50). 

We each grabbed a Neapolitan pizza with one additional topping each. I opted for the chicken, while my friend chose the Italian sausage. The service was adequate, but certainly nothing special. I encountered 3 employees here and did not see a single smile. 

Going through the line was fairly quick, but the cashier was a bit slow. I guess they serve alcoholic beverages as well, but we just chose to grab a couple of fountain drinks. When we got our pies we were handed a receipt that indicated $24 in charges. I can live with that, I'm thinking. At the register, I added 2, 20 ounce sodas. The new total was $33! Holy crap! $4.50 for a fucking soda?!? Seriously, I get that I am in a casino on the strip. I get it. But almost $5 for a 20 ounce soda is excessive even for that!

The pies were actually good. The chicken on my pie was tasty and I really enjoyed it. My friend was equally satisfied with his meal.

If i didn't get raped on the sodas, this would have been a 4 star review. But, in all honesty, I am one and done with this place. I like to enjoy a soda with my pizza and that price is a straight up joke.

Not only that, a big pet peeve of mine is when I tip and receive no acknowledgement. Even after getting violated on the sodas, I still left a few bucks for the employees(after all, they don't set the prices, right?). No \"thanks\", no anything. I don't expect you to kiss my ass, but sheesh...say something. I work for tips and every time someone leaves me something I always make it a point to say \"thank you, I appreciate that\". I guess they must be rolling in it over there.

Anyways, I was less than impressed and won't be back. Too bad, the pies were actually good for the price, but all that other mess assures I won't be back.

2 stars."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and the environment was pretty chill - not to mention a gelato case - but this pizza place just didn't cut it with the Neapolitan pizza genre.  I've been seeking out Vera Pizza Napoletana (VPN) for a while and found Settebello to be more on par with what real Neapolitan pizza is supposed to be.  Sorry, 800.  We were hoping to have a VPN place closer to the Strip, but maybe not this time.

Overall, it lacks what should be a better drink selection with the pizza and the quality of the cheese should not make the pie \"soupy\".  You can taste the difference in the ingredients and this can't be VPN.  In any case, the staff gets points, but the quality of the product doesn't."}
{"text":"Great concept with the choose your own assembly line, but my pizza came out terrible. soggy and falling apart. Maybe i came on a bad night, but I was horribly disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty damn expensive!! Every topping is an add on and honestly the topping choices are nothing to rave about. Seemed like they didn't have typical toppings (regular tomatoes, regular olives). 

Most customizable pizza places have better selection at a better price. (Pieology, Mod, Blaze...Pizza Rev...I can keep going LOL)

With that being said...its pizza and it's hard to mess up a personally customized pizza."}
{"text":"Cutest little spot ever. They make the pizza right in front of you. You get to pick every detail from the crust to the base. They have a pretty good toppings variety and very friendly staff... They give 50% off the pizza of the day  if you follow them on Instagram. The reason for the 4 stars and not five is because the pizza is way too thin.. BROWNIE POINTS FOR SPEED they're very quick at what they do and your pizza will be ready in just minutes. That's probably why the make them so thin, so they can cook faster. Also it does get pretty packed so be ready to waiit in line :) (I will post a video of the line)

Enjoy !!"}
{"text":"My first time here and the customer service is superb and very helpful. The margherita pizza was cooked to perfection I believe - nice thing crust, just enough sauce and just the right amount of basil and fresh mozzarella.  I also had a small Greek salad without olives.  For a small size, the portion was good for two, possibly three people.  
One of the ladies behind the counter actually brought the pizza and salad to the table which I thought was very helpful since I was carrying a lot of bags and had my son getting the napkins, utensils, etc."}
{"text":"Stayed at the SLS and this is a restaurant within the building.  Great little place!  You can pick your exact type of pizza and they make it for you while you walk through.  I would recommend this place!  Yummmm!!"}
{"text":"Really love the build your own style pizza. Great taste and was really quick. I'm assuming when It gets busy and might slow down a bit but we had out pizza in five minutes. A definite come back again place. A better version of Blaze, and for the record I love Blaze."}
{"text":"Staff at 4/3 4:15pm was amazing. Very friendly and polite. Food was decent.  Great option if you need a quick bite."}
{"text":"Calebrain chillies. These chiles were the biggest surprise of a recent Vegas trip, which should mean something because I saw all sorts of godless things happen that weekend. 

I am giving 5 stars for a wonderful combination of speed, price, and quality. I am also giving 5 stars because Yelp is being way too harsh on this place and I get very sad when I see the current review average.  The standard Margherita with chillies is just damn fantastic. This place is way better than Secret Pizza, which you only judge through some incredibly thick beer goggles. One pie ought to fill up an average adult's appetite."}
{"text":"I'm picky about my pizza and this was among the best I've had. EXCELLENT classic caprese."}
{"text":"Aside from being one of the only reasonably priced places to eat in Las Vegas, it's amazing. Create your own pizza from a ton of choices and they prepare it fresh in front of you. It will satisfy meat eaters, vegetarians, and vegans alike. Prompt, courteous, and delicious. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Toppings are high quality, dough is solid, flavors blend very well.  Burrata is a must try.  Very helpful staff, which many will need as this concept is still taking off."}
{"text":"Let me start by warning all potential visitors of the prices. I paid $4 for a 22oz fountain drink. The pizza was priced more reasonably at $14.95 for a 12 inch pie and additional $1.50 for toppings. Overall the pizza was extremely bland. I have had better frozen pizza from the grocery store. I ate a slice and dumped the rest. There are lots of options around the same area of the strip - you're better off going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very new place, I stopped by on their first day of business but didn't order anything because they were closing up. I convinced my brother that this was the place we needed to go for our final meal. I didn't have high expectations because the restaurant was less than 24 hours old but everything about the place was professional. 

The staff was amazing, friendly had no errors or fumbles with orders so that's a huge plus. I didn't see a single person there that didn't smile or have a friendly demeanor. 

Now for the pizza, there are so many options but we went with spinach, feta and chicken over their pesto. We were completely blown away. This is real pizza, not some Pizza Hut deal, the cheese is in chunks and they cooked it over in a fire stone oven, as it should be. My brother wasn't sure if he would like the pizza but when he finished his first slice he exclaimed \"this is the best pizza I have ever had\" and went in for more. We had originally planned to take the pizza with us to the airport but it didn't make it past five minutes. 

I had never been to an 800Â° pizzeria before but as a college student who has had many pies before I can say without a doubt that this is the best pizza I have ever had and I will be coming back for more, at this place or one of their other three locations. 

I have no negatives to say at all. I highly recommend this place, even if you aren't a pizza person!!"}
{"text":"I'm local and come to the SLS just for pizza. The food is great, a bit pricey, but that is what you get when you come to the strip. To me this place has the best brick oven pizza. I'm giving this place a 4/5 due to inconsistency with pricing when using your players card."}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza Ive had in Vegas and outside of NYC. Crust, cheese and sauce were all perfect. The pizza its self can get a little runny however, I used the pizza crust to mop up the excess. You can order from a pre fixed pizza menu or design your own. I choose the neapolitan crust and margherita base topped with roasted garlic and shrimp. The possibilities are endless at this place and since the pizza is cooked in an 800 degree wood burning oven, the pizza is done in minutes and ready to eat."}
{"text":"On my second visit to 800 degrees I was not as impressed with the food. However, the service was still friendly and helpful.

This time I chose the blt pizza and the Caesar salad. I watched the guy make the pizza and observed him putting olive oil, garlic, and Parmesan on the bottom of the pizza. I asked him if he was going to put any salt and he said yes we put some on top. 

After having my first slice of pizza I could tell that it was under seasoned and I did not taste any salt on top of the pizza. The Caesar salad came with big pieces of uncut lettuce and stale croutons. I did not like the Caesar dressing either because the anchovy flavor was too bold. 

I ended up having a few slices of pizza and left the salad on the table for my friend to pick at. I will be back but next time I will make my own pizza."}
{"text":"I like the Monte Carlo location better, the pizza was executed better. 

I ordered a white pie with arugula, cherry tomatoes, and caramelized onions. Like others have said, the pizza toppings slide off once you pick up a slice. The pizza was too flimsy and not properly executed. They season the white pie with minced garlic, olive oil, and salt. When I bit into the pizza all I tasted was olive oil and no seasoning. 

This pizza has the potential to be really good but the person making it needs to know the ratio of ingredients that work in order to give the pizza flavor and make the crust hold up better."}
{"text":"Solid pizza!! Very fresh dough and ingredients. Not much atmosphere but who cares... it's a great place  for a quick (and delicious) pizza in Vegas"}
{"text":"I originally ate at one down in LA, and decided to try this one to see how it compares. In the meantime, I have eaten at Pieology and Mod Pizza, and thought that neither of them could compete with 800's crust. My suggestions: order the original crust, not the crispy. If you're ordering salad, ask for the dressing on the side, or ask for light on the dressing. I would love to try their broccolini as a side dish. I had it as a topping and really liked it. Also if you're ordering a side or salad, you might consider splitting one pizza for two people, unless you're really hungry. I wish they would open one of these back home!!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza. A little better than Blaze Pizza which we're more familiar with. Smoke smell in the casino made enjoying the food a little difficult. Also wish they served Coke products rather than Pepsi."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews and the article in the magazine I expected to have great tasting pizza. I loved that it was thin crust but when I got it, it was soggy and not crispy at all. The pizza was cut and I use that word loosely because we had to get a knife and recut it in order to pull the slices apart. Toppings was good and not skimpy. The pizza was ok not the best. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Celiac and Gluten intolerant BEWARE. This is NOT a GF establishment. My husband and I went because of the reviews and GF option for me. They do not have a dedicated prep area. The sauce is spread by the same ladle as the regular pizza (directly from the regular to GF and back again). The flour flies everywhere and got on the so called GF crust / pan. I had to cancel my order. The staff was great about it. The pizza my husband got was really good and he enjoyed it. Great staff and pizza. Oh and for celiacs, beware of the flour in the air. My eyes and lips are still burning."}
{"text":"My boyfriend really wanted to try this place, so we went. The restaurant itself is nice and clean, I liked the atmosphere. The food was good, but overpriced for what you get. A 20 oz drink is $4.50 which is ridiculous but hey, it's Vegas. The service was also subpar. The girls working didn't smile at us at all while they were making our order, and seemed more focused on getting us out of there so that they could go back to gossiping with eachother. 
All in all, it was okay, but I won't be returning. I could've spent that $25 somewhere else and gotten twice the amount of food."}
{"text":"Great pizza! I'm celiac and I was so impressed how they prepared the area to avoid cross contamination when they made my gluten free pizza. They wiped down everything, the preparation area, the oven, changed gloves etc They take celiac and food allergies seriously."}
{"text":"I love simple pizzas with fresh ingredients. The pizza we ate was crispy with a nice chew. You can see you pick a dough, sauce, then your toppings. They have a beautiful selection of cured meats. 

Can I say I love the soda machine options as much as the pizza? Lol I mean they have strawberry diet Pepsi! Lol. 

The only reason I took off one star is the day I ate here the girls were verbally arguing with the bus boy/cashier for the world to see and hear. I mean come on guys keep it behind closed doors where customers can't hear you."}
{"text":"We wanted a low key dinner for our last night in Vegas, we were staying at NYNY so we had been eyeing this place all week. I am so glad we decided to try it! 

It is like a Subway for Pizzas! You pick your crust, sauce, toppings etc. Or they have some \"favorites\" that are predesigned. I ordered the Margarita pizza and added bacon! Holy yum. The chunks of cheese were so delicious and you get to watch them make your pizza right in front of your eyes. They pop it in the oven for 60 seconds, then out comes your pizza! 

My husband and I were so excited to try out different kinds, we each ordered a pizza (there is only one size available to order) but knowing now, we could def. have shared one! They are a perfect size for two people. We each ordered a half salad (available in half or full size). I had the gorgonzola (YUM) and he loved his Caesar. Even the \"half\" size was almost too much for me to finish! Their portions are great. They had beer and wine to order, but we went with soft drinks. 

We got out of here with 2 pizzas, 2 salads and 2 drinks for $50! We sat on their patio enjoyed the misters, and did some awesome people watching! Oooooh they also had $3 Gelato! Bonus!"}
{"text":"Margarita with ham, Italian sausage and sun dried tomatoes.  Washed down with New Castle on tap."}
{"text":"We ate at the walk-up pizza counter twice...great late night drunk food and pretty good pizza too!  This is just inside the Aria, so it convenient for all city center hotel patrons.  They had four varieties both times....three meaty types and one veggie.  I enjoyed the interesting toppings (peppers and purple potatoes) and the regular pepperoni.  Between my husband and myself, we tried each type.  The line moves along pretty quickly.  They are belly bars to eat your pizza.  Grab a beer or soda with your pizza, or sit at the nearby bar, order a cocktail and eat your pizza.

Again, I ate in the pizza by-the-slice area both times, so not a review for the sit-down restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good imitation of a Neapolitan Margarita pizza. Soft chewy crust, good quality olive oil, flavorful crushed & cherry tomatoes,  a bit of garlic and bufala mozzarella. Conscientious helpful staff. On the strip in front of Monte Carlo, so a bit pricey, but hey it's Vegas baby. $30 for the pizza and a glass of decent chianti. Sort of a chipotle for pies. A $3 shot of Gelato finished things off nicely.  If you can manage to walk by the Shake Shack 300' away, give it try."}
{"text":"Don't let the three stars fool you - I really liked this place.  We stopped in before seeing Blue Man Group on a Tuesday night to share a pizza and two salads.  The Greek salad is fantastic - absolutely perfect.  The pizza was a bit burned around the edges for my taste but good nonethless.  The staff were helpful but it was difficult to get past the music that was about three shades too loud."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza !!! Very quick service I had two of them during my stay at SLS the Bianca and margarita both very good !"}
{"text":"Fast food pizza made fresh to order before your eyes - truly amazing! I couldn't believe that our pizza was ready before we finished getting our drinks. I guess that's what happens when you use 800 degrees... The pizza crust was perfect and so delicious. I highly recommend this - they're open late, too, so it's the perfect late night snack."}
{"text":"I went there because they do a gf crust. The staff were knowledgeable and helpful. The pizza was delicious and cheesy. The edges of the cuts were a little burnt, but I guess that is due to the 800 degree oven. Good atmosphere. I would go again. Only four stars due to crust edges."}
{"text":"We were on vacation looking for a quick bite on the strip, saw this place and decided to give it a try. 

My husband is a self-proclaimed expert on eating pizza. The pizza was fantastic. Excellent sauce, crispy crust, fresh mozzarella and veggie toppings. 

The pizza was prepared in two minutes flat. Very enjoyable experience and nice atmosphere at a reasonable price. Please open one in my hometown in DC!! The only drawback is that the pizza only comes in one size."}
{"text":"Real Italian pizza - pizza like I had in Vencia - right on the strip.  My Gorgonzola salad was delicious too.  Basic pizza is $9.95 with toppings at $1.50 each."}
{"text":"I've been to 800 Degrees over in LA and I was pretty impressed.  This time around, I came because my friends and I were looking for food before our race and because we got 10% off for running the Rock and Roll Half Marathon.  The restaurant is located to the left if you are coming in through the front doors.  The place was pretty empty but then again we came around 2pm on a Sunday.  i saw the words arugula and truffle and immediately knew I wanted the Tartufo.  I asked for half roasted garlic and half minced garlic.  The pizza was decent.  Nothing too special. I liked the garlic flavor with the whole cloves of garlic but it was still pretty plain.  The other pie we got was the Zucca because I saw the words butternut squash.  Unfortunately, they ran out of squash so the server allowed us to substitute corn.  Not a one for one substitution but it was pretty good.  The pizza was sweet and savory with the corn and bacon.  I say it was better than the Tartufo because of the combination of flavors.

The place is good for a quick meal but nothing too impressive.  The pizzas are also pretty expensive when you think of the other fast food, build your own pizza places that are off the strip. Also, you have to pay for extra toppings.  800 Degrees is more high class than the other pizza shops but I don't the $1.50 per additional topping justifies the cost. Would be back but I might just head over to Umami instead..."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The pizza is about $10 for a perfect size to split. Which is a gem in the strip! The service is very quick, it only took 5 minutes to get our pizza. We highly recommend."}
{"text":"Absolutely Amazing Pizza!!!   The Naples-style pizza was so fresh and delicious,  complemented by excellent customer service!!
The choice offerings were so-mouthwatering good, I visited twice in 1 day. 

-Andre"}
{"text":"Very different style. Choices are endless when customizing your own pizza at 800 Degrees located inside the beautiful SLS Hotel! 

Oven hot & fresh! I would recommend it as a quick lunch meal! 

Pricey but can be split with 2 people and worth it!

Only thing I wish they had was different choices of cheese! 

Give it a shot"}
{"text":"The SLS hotel only got 1thing right...this pizza place! Great food and service.. The hotel on the other hand horrible!"}
{"text":"If only there was one of these off the strip! The dough was cooked to absolute perfection and i was impressed with the amount of in house ingredients and locally sourced dairy and produce. Even being on the strip you'll be hard pressed to find dining this good at these prices. While specialty pies top out at $15 you can still go for a Margherita at a shade under $8. Also while the beer list is not long or cheap they feature two taps from Goose Island in addition to fairly standard offerings. I found the staff to be pleasant as well. All of that combined with the proximity to other good eateries equals five stars for me."}
{"text":"OMG Yummy!!!! 5 stars if they had had the wine on the menu that I ordered. One of the best pizzas ever!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas , it taste just like your in Italy they have the fresh mozzarella and hot enough wood fired oven to get that char taste on your crust!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Try the spicy meatball specialty pizza. Really fresh ingredients plus a helpful and friendly staff. And reasonably priced for my Vegas budget! Couldn't ask for anything more. 

P.S. Yes people...I had a Vegas budget"}
{"text":"Loved the pizza here very original never tasted a pizza so good !!!! Baked in a brick oven so delicious salads are amazing as well definitely need to come eat here if visiting Vegas .."}
{"text":"Having grown familiar with 800 Degrees Pizza in LA, I was intrigued to try the location in the SLS. Granted I visited right after the SLS first opened, so some of my comments might be a little outdated.

The seating is far more cafeteria style than the LA locations, and I could see how things could get a bit tight if there's a crowd. It's also totally open to the gambling floor, which depending on who you are can be a good or a bad thing.

I have to say that the pizza was made perfectly, the employees were friendly, the entire place was spotless, and the biggest improvement from the LA location was a lack of rushing. This location really allows you to enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"It is on the pricey side. I enjoyed the food that I almost finished the whole personal plate I got!!! BF enjoyed his as well. I ordered my version of Breakfast Pizza."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the pizza very much, very creative process and the quality was actually worth the wait. Didn't think we would wait as long as we did, but in the end, glad we stuck around to enjoy it. Definitely eating here again."}
{"text":"So my friend and I tried this place having noticed the high reviews and this place is so highly rated also in Los Angeles. I was not impressed...

This a make your own pizza place. You can start out with certain pizzas - no sauce, red sauce, red sauce no cheese, or pesto. The basic pies are between $7-8, which is not bad... but when toppings are $1.50 each and special toppings $3 each, it can add up really fast! I ordered a red sauce pizza with 2 toppings and my pizza was already $11 for an individual pie.  You can also order their specialty pies that come with predetermined toppings for average of $14.  ... I tried many other pizza places that are WAY cheaper! For example, places like Pieology and Project Pie are much cheaper with just one price and unlimited toppings. I have not tried Project Pie (there is one inside MGM for $12 a pizza), but I love Pielogy as it's only $8 for a pizza with unlimited toppings. Frankly, I think Pielogy tastes better for much less. 

I'm guessing the prices are higher because 800 Degrees is a \"higher\" end pizza place... but the pizza was not all that tasty to me. The dough was good, but it was soggy in the middle of the pizza! I think pizza crust should be crispy! 

The location in Los Angeles has cheaper prices than this location in Vegas. I don't mind paying $11 for a pizza, but I do want it to taste good. Now that I've tried it, I don't have to wonder anymore as it is not good enough to make me want to come back. Next time I'll try the Project Pie inside MGM. I always see more people there anyways."}
{"text":"Perfect pizza after stumbling around the strip all day. Everyone on staff is fun and friendly and dancing as they make the pizza! It's in a big open room to, so the air is flowing and you definitely don't feel cramped at all. 

The pizza is super delish and reasonably priced. If I remember correctly I believe it's about 10 a pizza which can easily be split between two people. I recommend the zucca pizza which had bacon, caramelized onions, butternut squash! All with some fresh rosemary oil."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this restaurant. It's AMAZING. We were at the location at the SLS hotel but there is also a location at the Monte Carlo in Vegas as well as several in LA. . The prices are amazing. Our pizza with extra toppings was only $13 and was enough for two. You get to pick your crust, your base, your toppings and then they cook it in the wood fired oven right away. We got the thick crust with margarita base and added tri color cherry tomatoes, spinach, and  broccolini. The mozzarella is fresh and tasty. Everything about it is delicious. We also got the beet salad which had cheese to die for on it, a big huge piece of toasted fresh bread, crisp delicious yellow and red beets with wonderful balsamic dressing. They have gelato here too but I didn't get to try it. Seriously run to this restaurant. The staff is nice, the food is inexpensive and amazing, the restaurant is fun and casual with black and white paparazzi pictures on the ceiling and fun lights and dÃ©cor. There is nothing not to like and everything to love here so run run run."}
{"text":"Birthday lunch here, shared the anti pasta salad, olives, and sampler plate. Sat outside. Nice ambience. Food delicious and well prepared. Only fault on 5/8 was unable to hear when food is ready. Loved it so much came back next day for spicy garlic bread and small salad. The couple in line before me ordered their food and moved on through process.  I ordered my spicy garlic bread I love you can watch them prepare, the ingredients are right in front for viewing.  Was moving along to order my salad when the couple in front of me saw the garlic bread, they ordered some too. They gave the couple mine and would make mine over. I felt humiliated that they would just give my food to someone else, they can argue this review but it happened and complaining to Yelp isn't going to change that your staff is bringing  your business down
No one likes to feel unimportant when there are so many places to choose."}
{"text":"I thought their pizza was pretty delicious! And the prices are very reasonable too considering their location. Honestly the pizza was well flavored and not too heavy.. Their staff is extremely pleasant too I loved it there!"}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious and done well. Baby Kale salad, Greek and Ceasar were great, sweet spot on the strip. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!  They could not figure out how to make a salad and passed me off 4 times, all while keeping to their own personal conversations.  I watched my salad sit ready at the counter as 2 employees had a full on conversation---I finally interrupted with \"is that my salad\".  Got it home and it was missing multiple toppings.  Called back and explained and the manager, Flavio, was rude and didn't say sorry once.  I live right next store at Veer and you have lost mine and my husbands regular business."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. The staff was so friendly but unfortunately the food was terrible. everything about it was horrible: flavor, texture, presentation, etc. The salad was good enough that we ate it after we threw out the pizza."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food quality, 2 stars for the customer service, 2 stars for the cleanliness. Flies were flying around us whole time we were there and cashier girl didn't make us feel welcomed at all. With so many options available around the strip, I would not come back to this place again. Would definitely share my experiences with my family and friends."}
{"text":"Located inside SLS, 800 Degrees Neapolitan Pizzeria is putting out a legitimate Neapolitan pie. They often have a pizza of the day that's half off the regular price and promote it on their social media accounts. I noticed they were having a promotion where locals with ID got 50% off their whole bill, so hubby and I got in on that action. When I let the cashier know about the promotion and showed my ID, she accepted it with no problem and was courteous. The pizzas are baked for 60 seconds in an 800 degree oven. I did find the pizzas here comparable with those served at Settebello as far as taste, texture and overall expertise in knowing how to make a true Neapolitan pizza. If 800 Degrees Neapolitan Pizzeria had an off Strip location like Settebello, they too could have a large local following. A lot of us don't want to mess with going to the Strip, so while I loved my pizza, I can't see regularly stopping by here given the location. 

Fountain Drinks ($4.00) - What a rip! I know a lot of places mark up the beverages, but come on, $4 each is totally ridiculous! 2 fountain drinks shouldn't cost as much as one pizza. Should I ever come back again I'll just stop at a corner store first and grab a fountain drink which is something hubby and I do often since we are getting the food either to-go, or we eat it in the food court of a casino, so it's not odd to see people with different beverages. 

Margherita Pizza ($9.95) - Crushed tomatoes, Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Basil and Olive Oil. These are personal size pizzas. I really liked the flavor of the crushed tomatoes and the crust was on point being soft and chewy with the right amount of blistering around the edge of the crust. Definitely a worthy margherita. 

Sausage and Peppers Pizza ($14.95) - Italian Sausage, Peppadews and caramelized onions. This one might seem pricey, but with the quality of ingredients used it's priced just right. The toppings had good flavors and all complimented each other well.  

Gluten-Free Crust is available for an extra $1.50 and imported mozzarella can be substituted if your wallet feels like paying an extra $6. You can choose from the \"Chef's Favorites\" part of the menu like I did, or customize your own pizza. They also have salads, hot and cold appetizers as well beer and wine on the menu."}
{"text":"Very good service, the food was very fresh, very neat setting.  1 pizza was plenty for the wife and I for lunch."}
{"text":"Wow, there are plenty of good reviews about this place but I can't believe it. Our margarita pizza was soooo disappointing. The maranara sauce on the pizza tasted like it was tomato soup from a can. We will not come back to this place.i can't give it less than one star or I would."}
{"text":"If you want to see a unique pizza place, this is it.  If you want good pizza, go someplace else!"}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect, low expectations. I was completely satisfied with the service as well as the quality of food. 

I received extra quality service from Emmanuel, he went above and beyond to ensure we had a quality experience. 

I would absolutely recommend eating at this establishment. The food is amazing, the quality of food is exceptional, and the service they provide is well beyond expectations. 

Also, I'm vegan and they have plenty of vegan options to choose from. Vegan cheese, vegan meatballs, etc. 

Great place. Great environment. Great service. Great food."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided it was time to try this place out after we have gotten a recommendation from one of our friends.

We came here on a Friday night at around 1115pm. The place had about 3 people online. I asked for recommendations to the employee and she was very attentive and gave me a variety of options . 
Will definitely be coming back here soon! The pizza was perfect."}
{"text":"Fresh and quality ingredients! Staff genuinely friendly and nice. Delicious pizza and great soda variety, Coca Cola products. Many choices to make a pie of your liking, just keep in mind each topping is extra. Very clean and airy environment."}
{"text":"Delicious Pizza! The guys were busy but managed to clean the tables as soon as I asked. Great service. I highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza you will find in all of Las Vegas. Trust me, no other pizza in this town is even half as good. The Angry Bee is my go to here, and if you love sweet and savory like I do, definitely give it a try! Anytime I'm down on the strip this is what I want to eat. 

This is the perfect place for entertaining guests on the strip because of the perfect location right on Las Vegas Blvd., the quick service (this one is usually busier than the one at SLS, though) and the absolutely delicious pizza. This one gets a bump over the one at SLS because the food was slightly better, and this location serves Coke unlike the one at SLS which serves Pepsi... I know, not a huge deal but I like Coke better. 

So if you don't mind wading through the drunk 20-somethings on the strip to have the best pizza in all of Vegas, then definitely visit 800 degrees."}
{"text":"For you So Cal yelpers, this is similar to Project Pie or Pieology, but kicked up a notch so we can now call pizza \"classy\".  While this place is edgy and modern, like much of SLS, they make for a really good stop.  Customized orders with quality ingredients, at a great price, and ready in record time seals the deal. 

One pie per person is probably best, but trade slices!"}
{"text":"AMAZING PIZZA!!!!! Love this place!!!!!!

I LOVE the 800 Degrees in LA, so I was super excited to find this restaurant on the strip!

All the pizza options are awesome....I especially loved the verde one, cause I'm a sucker for green sauce. 

The toppings are yummy and fresh.....love the capers and kalamata olives. If you like spicy pizza, DEFINITELY get the chili sauce topping! It's to die for!  I even bought a bottle of the chili sauce on my 3rd visit here. 

EXTRA plus......it's walking distance from Aria.....so you can get great drinks and then head to 800 Degrees for a satisfying dinner :)"}
{"text":"We were really excited  to try this place out , but it was nothing special. Pretty much  a really expensive  and nit as good version of pieology. Each topping was 1.50.  I totally get that food is more expensive on the strip but it was not worth it. Not to mention they opened 15 minutes late and were not even apologetic to the line of people waiting."}
{"text":"Very classy pizza joint. You can not order by the slice... just personal pies... you get to pick your dough, sauce, cheese and toppings... DELICIOUS!!!!!!! I had this multiple times when i stayed at the SLS hotel. So freaking good! I am actually craving it right now."}
{"text":"Awesome crust! Balanced, flavorful but not too salty.  Slightly overpriced topping but justified by the large selection and freshness.  We've been here for late lunch two days in a role and were welcomed by two different staff faces.  The first day was friendly and nice, today it was a little aggressive, especially the topping girl. Perhaps people get tired after long shift.

My experience concludes that it's a good pizza joint.  I will come back for sure, but at a different time to avoid the topping girl.  FYI she's short and wears glasses"}
{"text":"These design-your-own pizza places are popping up everywhere. Even with all the options available, 800 Degrees stands head and shoulders above any other place I've visited.

This location is really nice, with high ceilings and clean decor, but the most beautiful feature of the restaurant is all of the pizza toppings! A twenty-foot-long buffet of them, I think...perfect cubes of butternut squash, fresh mozzarella, bunches of thyme, sweet roasted garlic, slices of eggplant, a variety of different hot peppers, caramelized onions, artichoke hearts, rosemary oil, on and on. 

You can choose from the list of pre-designed pizzas on the wall, or customize your own. Plus, there non-pizza options as well--salads, and burrata with your choice of accompaniments (beets and balsamic, prosciutto and melon, etc.), meatballs, broccolini.

The pizzas are perfect, though, with crisp edges and soft middles. If you like spicy, request some of their chili pepper nonsense on the side. Spicy and incredibly flavorful, almost a buffalo sauce type of thing going on. Perfect for dipping bites of crust. I love the Tartufo, with truffle cheese, mushrooms, roasted garlic, and arugula.

This is pizza to enjoy when you're on your game, not the stuff you get to soak up the excess amounts of alcohol sloshing around in your stomach."}
{"text":"This hand crafted pizza place has some of the freshest ingredients. The pizza is flash cooked at 800Â° for 90 seconds in the huge wood-fire oven. You walk-in choose your toppings, they flip the dough in the air and cover it with some of the finest cheese and perfect amount of veggies. It's always baked to perfection."}
{"text":"pizza studio or pieology style.  each topping $1.5 extra.  got the angry bee but they were a bit skimpy on the soppressata meat.  spicy from the calabrian chile oil (maybe a bit too much), they top with generous honey -- added arugula which helped for more balance. dough could be in slightly longer but overall pretty good especially for the speed.  gelato coupon. 
another option is to get a margherita and add sausage"}
{"text":"great food every time I go I enjoy a great pizza like to try new stuff every time and I also enjoy the staff members always trying there best with positive energy"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and customer service! The atmosphere there is amazing and the food is even better. 10/10 recommend. You build your own pizza from scratch and it's ready in minutes afterward. They also serve drinks here too and you can add all the parmesan cheese you want after it's made."}
{"text":"The sausage was so gross on the pizza.  They burnt the crust.  However, it was priced well for a casino place....so that was a plus."}
{"text":"The pizza here was awesome. Made our own with the Margarita sauce. You can taste the freshness in the sauce and toppings. Also ordered a salad. It was plenty for my wife and I. The prices aren't bad either. Lots of food for what you pay and cheaper than other places in the strip. Will definitely be checking this place out again the next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Solid \"make your own by selections\" pizza joint, which was clean, quick and friendly.  The mozzarella cheese is torn by hand from a large chunk, and not shredded, so it's not evenly distributed.  While this looks cool and fun, I prefer the uniformity of shredded mozzarella placed evenly throughout the pie.  The freestyle coke machine is awesome, and we enjoyed mixing flavors to make the perfect combo.  Pizza is delicious, with the caveat already noted, and the dough cooked just right.  Overall, this is a great place for pizza lovers to grab a quick snack with plenty of seating space."}
{"text":"One of the cheapest and fastest pizza options on the Strip. Yes, I was positively surprised with the high quality of food and service. The only thing it took forever to serve them our wine and beer. That was weird."}
{"text":"This place is AWFUL!! We ordered maybe $100 worth of food and the cashier made a mistake no problem,   manager arrives and couldn't perform the simple task of splitting the bills in half, causing her to charge one of my friends $28 3 times on his credit card...the remaining 28 were paid with a 100, was given the wrong change and it took over 20 mins 2 managers and various over charges on a card to get simple change ..we got NO apology, and ATTITUDE when confronted with the problem. The \"manager\" then proceeds to lean on to her elbows heavily sigh and look at the computer..all the while I'm thinking what is this chicks problem? We didn't make the mistake?

ON TOP of that, some of our food came out cold all the while half the party is at the register for 30 minutes dealing with an employee who can't admit she fucked up.

Don't go here, save your money.
These people were completely unprofessional. 
If I can give 0 zero stars I would."}
{"text":"This is some good pizza! Everything made to order fresh right in front of you. If you're looking to grab a quick casual bite this is the place. It's cafeteria style, with seat yourself benches and outdoor dining. If you want a restaurant intimate experience this is not the place. It's not crazy overpriced either. You get a good sized fresh specialty pizza for the same price as a local pizza place back home. The only drawback is waiting in line. It's usually very busy and lined up out the door."}
{"text":"They should probably call it 650 degrees...running the oven low temp caused a pasty white crust compared to a well cooked, charred Neapolitan pizza. Good atmosphere and friendly staff. The burrata salads were a real disappointment. A bite sized burrata for $12."}
{"text":"I came here the night AFTER hitting up Secret Pizza. After the RNRLV 5K, it just seemed easier to eat here in the SLS. After a long wait, we ordered. Two pizzas and a beer for my friend came to almost $40. It was decent, but honestly, 2 pieces at Secret Pizza would have been tastier and less expensive. But sometimes you pay for convenience, and that's what we did."}
{"text":"Cool concept with nice, personalized pizzas. It won't be the best pizza you've ever had, but it's good and makes for a nice late night snack on the strip of an easy lunch."}
{"text":"The pizza was good, but I wish there were more vegetable options. I liked that they have vegan Daiya cheese as an option. We also felt a little rushed for picking our options since it was a little busy."}
{"text":"I went to 800 degrees because it was 50% off for locals this past Sunday and I've been meaning to take advantage of this promotion and this Sunday was the first time I actually remembered to do it. 

I would eat here anytime it is 50% off but otherwise I wouldn't make this my first choice for pizza. I ordered the white pizza and added nothing else but the spicy salami. My boyfriend ordered a margarita and added shredded provolone and pepperoni. I liked his pizza better than mine, mine could have been good if there was more cheese so at least for next time I know. 

The flavor of the pizzas were ok but just as everyone else said---these were the flimsiest pizzas ever, very soggy and greasy in the middle. The crust was fine. 

I like the concept and I will return but only on Sunday for the locals promotion."}
{"text":"Pizza Chipotle style- YES PLEASE! 

If you are craving pizza, 800 Degrees is the place to go and is right on the strip for easy access! All the ingredients are 100% Fresh and right in front of you for you to pick and choose what you want on your very own WOOD Fire pizza!  Not only are their pizza's to die for, so are their Salads! 

Bonus- they have the fun Coca Cola machines!!  

Please come to the East Coast!"}
{"text":"Sehr gute hausgemachte Pizza aus dem steinofen. Nach der Basis kann man die zutaten nach eigenen wÃ¼nschen ergÃ¤nzen.

Direkt im Casino also fÃ¼r den schnellen Hunger zwischen dem Spielen perfekt geeignet.

Leckere kleine Vorspeisen die fÃ¼r die Menge leider etwas teuer sind aber frisch und gut. Die Pizza ist mit 10 USD sehr gÃ¼nstig."}
{"text":"Amazing. The pizza is so good and rustic. I'm thinking about it a few days later. Wish it was here in San Diego! The chopped salad was really good too. You could tell it was quality food product. We were very hungry and the food was fast! Also they have clean single bathrooms!"}
{"text":"Worth it! Don't you get tired of spending a boatload of cash while you're on the Strip, on mediocre food served by apathetic employees? This place is terrific. The prices are quite reasonable and the pizza is delicious. You can customize them, but don't load thin crust pizza up with too many ingredients. Best of all, the staff is friendly, efficient, and quick to clean the dining room. Go! You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza I've had in Vegas. They use fresh natural ingredients. SLS is also a great location. Prices are really good on the pies but they catch up on the beverages."}
{"text":"Right outside the Monte Carlo. Great pizza. Fresh ingredients. They have pizzas to order or create your own. Super fast and the service is always great! It is a relaxed restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. We have stopped here for a snack or a meal and are never disappointed. Great prices."}
{"text":"My friend and I were walking the strip like some hungry ass wolves.  We'd just flew into Vegas and hadn't eaten any breakfast.  I had eaten at the first 800* in Los Angeles and had nostalgic feelings and wanted to try it again.  Pizza was for sure a hit, but the salad was a meh!  Felt the dressing was practically making me want to cough.  We had balsamic with olive oil.  Our grand total for a cheese pizza and one large salad was just a little over $20 for 2 people.  

If I do go back here I'll just stick to the pizza and avoid the salad."}
{"text":"Literally just had the best Gorgonzola butter lettuce salad of my life. No joke! 
Is it weird that I am eating a salad at 2am on a weekend night in Vega$?!
Don't fret...I ordered a piping hot pizza too, which is apparently what they are famous for. A chef creates a personalized pizza as you watch. You can chose from many fresh premium ingredients that are lined up so you can see them behind the counter. And then...the magic happens. The pizza cooks to perfection in 60 seconds in their 800 degree oven, hence the name ;-)
Bonus points for them being open late night too. Located right outside the new megaclub 'LIFE'"}
{"text":"Didn't think this place would be good as a quick bite on the strip but I was definitely proven wrong! The best/fanciest/bang for your buck pizza joint. They are not necessarily personal size pizzas, so share w/a friend. The deets: $13pizza of 3-4toppings for two...quality! Ready in minutes. Nice sit down. Beer & wine options"}
{"text":"Not so delicious. Capresse pizza didn't even come with tomato. Paid a $1.50 extra for a few tomatoes."}
{"text":"Good fast thin pizza, got to sit outside. Only 15.00 nothing great but no compliant either"}
{"text":"My husband and I are arguing right now over this rating, I say 3 and he is arguing for 2. He said, and I quote \" the center of the pizza was like a limp di*k it was so soggy. I like my pizza to be erect when I put it in my mouth.\" Yes, it's a little disconcerting for me to hear him talking about putting erect things in his mouth, but that's not the point of this review, so I'll move on.

I actually didn't think it was that bad, I got the spicy meatball one and it was very spicy indeed. I picked off most of the jalapenos. My husband got the one with honey on it...something about a bee and he hated it. He said mine was marginally better. It was really spicy too, I don't think he was expecting that.

However, we both agreed that the truffle cheese bread we got was very good, albeit expensive. That was another one of my husband's issues he thought it was way too expensive for pizza. I will admit the price of almost $60 for 2 small pizzas, a cheese bread and 2 beers does seem rather high, but let's face it, nobody goes to Vegas to save money.

Would I go back? No probably not as it did not thrill me with sparkles and rainbows, but I'm not harboring a grudge against it like my husband is...I'll save that for the 3 card poker table that stole $100 from me in three hands! Bastard!"}
{"text":"Not all that hype people give it pizza is ok 1.50 for extra toppings location is nice but customer service is not that great, pizza prep girl was rude..."}
{"text":"800 Degrees was delicious. Very non-traditional pizzas. I had the Angry Bee, which was soppressata, garlic, honey and Calabrian chiles. No complaints: it was sweet and spicy and amazing. My only issues are that they run a little pricey (though they have a special discounted pizza everyday on their IG account). Also, I was a little overwhelmed by the menu and options, which is probably more about me and my poor decision making skills, lol. I'd go back again."}
{"text":"The best pizza spot on the strip. Great prices and super fast. Perfect for a quick lunch between meetings, or if you have a little extra time sitting outside to people watch is always a good time. Luv the fact that you can start from a classic base & build your own new favorite pizza. Def make sure to add jalapeÃ±os to anything you make adds just the right amount of kick. If you're more into the healthy side you can always choose a salad option they have several to choose from, the gorgonzola salad is a must. And nothing would be complete here if you don't make a trip or two to the fancy coke machine where you can mix a match to make your favorite beverage. The high-C raspberry is my fav among many options. I've yet to go wrong with the selections I've made here, which is a win in my book."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza place with a wonderful decor and seating, both inside and out.  Right on the Vegas strip.  We loved the fresh salad and an excellent cheese pizza.  We will definitely return when we are back in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is easily my new go to pizza spot in Vegas because it's steps away from my place at Veer and they also happen to have gluten free crust and a ton of quinquennial veggie options to choose from. I came in here a few nights ago and ordered a margarita pizza on gluten free dough. The dough was brought in from the back and the employee kindly removed his gloves, wiped down his outfit and arms and put new gloves on. It really makes my day that he took that extra step to avoid cross contamination. As I went down the line I added mushrooms, pine nuts and rosemary. Since they charge you a flat rate based on your sauce plus $1.50 this stopped me from going crazy on the toppings. I also ordered a Zuppa pizza which comes with rosemary olive oil, mozzarella, butternut squash, caramelized onions and bacon (we ordered it without the bacon) and opted to add pine nuts as well to add back in the saltiness. As I get to the cashier I was greeted by Rashonda (sp?) who had the most amazing energy to her, I wish I could describe it but her energy told me that she loves her job and genuinely was happy to be at work (hard to find). Thomas was also a hoot as he was energetic and friendly as I stood there waiting as he spun my pizza in the oven making sure it was perfectly cooked. Overall I would rate this as a five star experience. The only drawback is the fact they charge $1.50 per topping when not much is given. I understand charging that for meat, but it's kinda a bummer when you pay for half a handful of pine nuts or squash. 

I look forward to coming back in again soon to try more delicious combinations or even talk them into letting me make a gluten free Nutella pizza since they have the Nutella calzone!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat on the Las Vegas Strip. Fast service with great pizza, but I usually get the large chop salad. The salad costs about $13, but is huge! 

Located right on Las Vegas Blvd and by the Monte Carlo. Lots of seating and good service. I highly recommend these guys when you're visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"Pizza was hng. 
Good recommendations and thorough gluten free prep consideration. Pizza with truffle, garlic and arugula was on point. Kilt it"}
{"text":"I was a guest at the hotel so it was quite convenient, because I was craving pizza. My Bf and I are on a diet but we had a long flight, and wanted comfort food. Pizza is the best comfort food, in my opinion. 

This pizza was awful. I had the pepperoni and my Bf had something else, don't remember the name of it (one of their specialty pizzas). This pizza was not good at all. It pretty much feel apart as you were eating it. In my opinion, the sauce and cheese, mainly the sauce determines the taste of the pizza. This was so bland, tasted like they had sauce and tried stretching the sauce with lots of water. I was all excited as they made the pizza in front of you, but I would rather have gone to the store and bought frozen pizza. FYI, the staff were really nice and were very helpful.

So back to my diet, you know when you are on a diet and you chose to cheat, and eat something good. I honestly wasted my calories space on this. It was late so we got through as much as we could to get to a satisfying state (not taste specific) and left the rest. We were so traumatized, I did not want to eat anything else on the Strip. There was a McDonald across the street, we contemplated eating there the rest of the trip lol. 

Overall, the atmosphere is ok, but this pizza was TASTELESS. We did decide to eat from other places, which were so much better and we did not leave Vegas thinking their food sucks."}
{"text":"I've never had such a soggy pizza! The Bianca wasn't as soggy but the marinara--dear god please send help from Blaze or Pieology. Just because you're located in Vegas does NOT mean you can skimp out on the amount of each topping you give. $1.50 for each topping??? Ridiculous. So dissatisfied!"}
{"text":"Wandering down the Strip, looking for something quick and tasty. My friends and I stopped when we saw 800 Degrees and it looked like it fit the bill.

It's fun to walk through the line, picking your type of pizza and toppings (like Subway for your pizza!). It's also super quick - I think it was less than 10 minutes from ordering to having it ready. I got a basic margherita - nice chewy crust, tasty sauce, light garlic taste, but needed a bit more mozzarella for my total happiness. Overall, though, everyone was happy with their food. Not a bad choice!"}
{"text":"Literally the best gf pizza I've ever had in my life. So good in fact, that I had dinner there the 2 nights I was at the SLS for a work conference. They were very cognizant about gf, they wore gloves, cleaned the prep area, cleaned the wood oven, and used separate utensils. This was the first place, outside my kitchen, where I didn't think I was going to die because my intestines were getting ripped apart from gluten."}
{"text":"Great concept and good tasting pizza. Walking in we didn't know what to expect but seeing the dough in the air and the atmosphere was truly special. You can tell the pizza was good because everyone was smiling. 

The specialty pizza's were a good combination. We had a Tropicalli and the BLT. We asked to have the pizza's cooked extra crispy and that was a great choice. The cheese was good, the sauce was tasty. 

Overall it was 800 is a great casual place to take friends who are visiting. The pricing was amazing. Just FYI the hours on Yelp are wrong they close at 10pm Sunday."}
{"text":"It's been a little over a week since I moved to Vegas from LA. One of the things I thought I would miss the most was the 800 Degrees in Westwood. So, I was ecstatic when I found out that there was an 800 Degrees franchise on the Strip!

The Monte Carlo did a nice job of renovating their facade with some of these new restaurants. The pizza here is relatively the same as the one in LA. The main difference is the slightly higher cost for toppings and soda. Each additional topping was $1.50 instead of $1 and the soda was $1 more as well. Other than that, the margherita pizza was fantastic as usual. The manager even walked around to check on all of his customers. 

Cheap, good pizza is truly hard to beat."}
{"text":"It's a great place for Neapolitan pizza! The staff is friendly and it's reasonably priced :) is definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Place is tha bomb! So good and reasonably priced. Check it out"}
{"text":"Friendly staff... Very efficient in getting my order going and everyone greeted me with a warm smile! Pizza was superb. This is a great pitstop for anyone hungry while touring the Vegas strip!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has a nice appeal with everything presented in front of you to build your own pizza. The topping options are fun and the service is fast. The pizza is cooked at such a quick pace  it's shocking how fast you are served. You order and pay at the counter and then you pick your food up once it is called. The pizza is good but not great. The crust is bland and I think would be better if it were a little more crispy. The red sauce is bland so I didn't feel like our pizza had much flavor. I am spoiled by pizza in the northeast so I'm sure it varies by an individuals palate preference. We also had a large Caesar salad which was perfect for sharing. The dressing was light with a lemon flavor and We enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This place is really good! This pizza place is not your ordinary Pizza Hut. So much toppings to choose from. It's definitely Italian pizza. So delicious!"}
{"text":"Whenever I go to a new pizza place, I always try a basic sausage pizza.  I ordered sausage with onions, and could not believe how quickly my pizza was ready.  Now you can not go and eat this right away when they bring it out.  The cheese was bubbling and the steam coming off of this indicated that it might be a little hotter than 800 degrees.  Ok, no worries.  After it cooled down to where I could pick up a slice, one bite of this pizza put me in pizza heaven. I think it may have taken me 10 minutes to down this pizza after the first bite.  It is that good.  It is a bit pricey, but it is worth every single penny.  The service is top notch, and they had some really good music playing in the restaurant when I was there."}
{"text":"The pizza was ok but a little pricey. There is a place in the DC area called &pizza that does the exact same thing, more topping options, less expensive. The soda machine needs to be cleaned or the filtration system changed."}
{"text":"Yummy taste and fresh ingredients! You can watch them roll out the dough and make it in their wood fire oven. Great prices for what you get!

They also have an options of beer and wine. If you want something sweet they have gelato...which I would love to try next time. Good option for those close to the Monte Carlo!"}
{"text":"Ok this review might be a bit biased since I was kind of hammered but I had others in my party sober so my review does hold water. 

Ok I was craving pizza and since vegas does stay open later than in SoCal I was happy. First pizza I got was a the classic Margherita pizza which was the cheapest at 7 and change. got a beer for less than 16 bucks. It was a great pizza thin crust nice and a bit charred on the edges. Since I was drunk and my party took my pizza i decided to go with the verdi pizza which is pesto and cheese. That was even better than the first one. 

The service is awesome nice people chatting away and the service is quick. My pizza was cooked not raw like some of these reviews. Guess what the pizza will be charged since they are using charcoal ovens. overall great place if your are hungry and need a break from the strip."}
{"text":"Omg I'm so f*ckn pissed at this place! I paid for $25 of meatless pizza and 2 bottles of water! All I can taste in my pizza was anchovies and a few pieces of prosciutto/sopresatta that I paid extra for! They should've given me more meat!!! The crust was soggy, too much sauce and barely had any basil. I wish I could've taken a pic but I forgot. I was so annoyed at how stingy these toppings were, I don't understand because some of the pics actually looked good and more generous...argh I'm so fckn angry!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Maybe it's because we had not eaten all day and were hung over lol but I'm pretty sure this place was amazing ! We scarfed down our pizza and cheese bread. It was really good and next time I'm in town I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Man I love their pizza.  If you're in the SLS this is a no brainer.  I wasn't terribly excited at first because I eat at 800 Degrees frequently in LA, but one day I was hungry and impatient.  Their food always delivers.  Pizza is thin crust, light, and makes you less guilty for eating carbs. Toppings are a plenty - I always like the broccoli, garlic, white pizza. The truffle cheese bread is a little too thick and bready and much for me - but the flavor is spot on.

The service was outstanding - the guys working there were incredibly friendly.  Pizzas are ready in 90 seconds."}
{"text":"Zero stars. After waiting in the ridiculously long line, I was then informed that they were out of gluten free crust (that they charge almost $2 extra for). We are attending a convention and had limited time to eat, so we were forced to find something else and barely had time to a scarf it down. Was anxious to try it but won't be back."}
{"text":"Love it. Came here first time and had good experience. Very clean and very nice. Introduce how can we order the pizza with many options. Love the atomosphere here. It's very tasty and the salad is good."}
{"text":"This is a nice, convenient relatively cheap (per Vegas standards) place to grab quick bite to eat.  Pizza was good- not great.  Service was painfully slow, they spent more time joking around and talking to each other than helping customers."}
{"text":"Came here a while back and later gushed to my friend how 800 Degrees has better and fresher ingredients compared to Pieology and it's also cheaper than Project Pie! So I convinced her to come along with me and give it a try. They have the same concept, which is basically a Chipotle for pizza. You pick your crust (crispy, Neapolitan, or gluten-free), your base (margherita, bianca, marinara, or verde), and then add your toppings!

Food-wise, we both got what we expected. I ordered a gluten-free crust Bianca with roasted tomatoes, pineapples, and chicken while she got an original Neapolitan crust with margherita meatball and corn. Quality of our toppings was great! I love love loved the roasted tomatoes while she loved the roasted corn. Our crust turned out just right, we were slightly worried that it would be covered in charcoal as experienced at other places but we were pleased to see it baked to perfection.

What surprised me about my visit was the service. I understand that people don't typically order the gluten-free crust but I guess I should apologize to the servers for the inconvenience I brought upon them by asking for it. The first server I was talking to asked if it was just a preference or if it was for an allergic reason. Would there have been a difference if I was allergic rather than it just being my preferred type of crust? Would they have acted more urgently? But that did not leave a negative impression on me until what had happened after. I stood off to the side of the line since I was waiting for my crust as the server was fetching it from the back kitchen for a couple seconds. However, I was approached by another server who told me that since I did not have my pizza, I should stand farther away because I'm blocking the other customers (that had no problem moving right along the line). I had already stood off to the side and here he was asking me to stand behind the line where I basically lost my place. The original server came back and tried looking for me and obviously could not find me since I was directed by the second server to wait basically out of the line. After all the confusion, I found my way back to the first server and who assisted me with my pizza. Why did it have to be so complicated?! Oh well!"}
{"text":"I tried another location of this restaurant and loved it.  Unfortunately this location needs work.  I went there on a crowded weekend at about 10pm.  The environment was horrible.  There is no separation between the casino and the restaurant.  On a Saturday night there are clubbers all lined up surrounding the place making getting in or out almost impossible.  I suppose if that's your thing then go for it, but I came here to just eat.  The volume level in the entire place made it almost impossible to order or eat.  So I yelled that I wanted a Margarita base with some toppings.   I was really surprised that they charged $1.50 each for each of the six toppings we chose.   The toppings were good, but really sparse.  When you do the math, the pizza cost $7.65 plus another $9 for toppings.  Incredible.  None of this was noted on the menu wall nor was it mentioned to us.  There was no communication from the employees at all.    They need a walls.   There is no wall at all in the front.  On the side there is a low wall, but it was surrounded by dozens of people standing around talking loudly waiting to get into some club.  There is a great deal of smoke visible outside even in the dim lighting.

We also ordered a Caesar salad.  Next we paid and went to get our drinks and a table.  While we were getting drinks they were over there yelling our number over and over again.  Now I understand that due to the volume level there is a need to yell, but there was simply not enough time to sit before they were yelling for us to come get our food.  When I finally put my drink down and came back to get the pizza there was nobody there.  I was really disappointed that they did not do like their Santa Monica location and give people a number for the table and bring the food out.   Service really was horrible, too.  Nobody came to our table to ask us anything except if they could remove an empty plate.  Which was disappointing because I had issues with the food.  The salad was really plain with almost no flavor or dressing.  Just a little shredded cheese and a few croutons.  No tomatoes or anything else.  I've had better salads at fast food restaurants.   I looked around the place and there were no condiments anywhere.  No vinegar and oil.  No Parmesan cheese.  No peppers.  No salt.  No pepper. This food needed something.

Now on to the whole reason you go do a pizza restaurant.  The Pizza.  It had good crust around the edges, but it was incredibly soggy everywhere else.  Our pizza had more than the average amount of toppings.  You need to allow for this when cooking.  The toppings were almost raw and the dough did not cook.  I want to give this place one more chance.   Next time I will try it for lunch and hopefully they will improve.   I want to like this.    

If I had to sum this place up in two words they would be Loud and Soggy."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and helpful.  As for the pizza itself, meh. Saw a review stating they were too thin in the middle and my husband and I both agree about that opinion. We both chose the margherita base, minus the basil for my hubby, he needn't have bothered as mine had all of 2 leaves. Where the dough was thicker it was really good, however the middle is so soggy I gave up after 3 slices. My hubby ate a couple of mine but the crust was so burnt that's really all I tasted. It's too bad, I really wanted to love this place. At $36 for our whole  meal, 2 pies, a soda, tap water and a glass of tap wine it's not a bad deal. Just really wanted my lunch to taste better. Our pies were cooked together and my husbands crust wasn't  burnt."}
{"text":"I love this place.

 No where in Las Vegas can you get a pizza with quality ingredients for 5 dollars, except hear. A whole pizza of the day is 5 dollars. I can eat 3/4 of a pizza or a 1 and 1/2 either way I'll be full and satisfied.

I'm on the strip 2 week days out of the week I check to see what the pizza of the day is everyday on Instagram. 

I like the Bianca's, and the red sauce pizzas. I've had a few verde too and I like them all as well. I usually will order a chopped salad with it. I like the meats that are in the sale and it's cheap for a decent sized portion."}
{"text":"I love pizza! I've tried pizza in many countries, including Italy! I can say that this was one of the top top pizzas I've tried ... This should be treated as one of the must try attractions while in LV."}
{"text":"Food was great.  I got the pesto pizza base with grilled onions and gorgonzola cheese.  I could eat that every day.  Knock it down one star because the menu was a little confusing at first and when you pick up your order the plates are extremely hot to the touch."}
{"text":"I thought this place was a nice surprise on the strip, especially since some of the other food experiences in Vegas have been hit or miss (mostly miss). It is essentially a Pizza Fast-Food joint, but with quality fresh ingredients (sort of like MOD Pizza). The pizza's are cooked in a traditional wood fired pizza oven. 

The prices were typical for the strip. My girlfriend and I picked up a couple of pies to-go and brought them back to our Spa Suite at the Monte Carlo. 

Here is my reason for 4 Stars instead of 5 Stars (obviously I still thought the food was good). We ordered our pizzas, which is the part that takes the longest, especially if you have a family ordering all custom pizzas instead of picking pre-configured pizzas from the menu. They cook them in order or preparation. So my girlfriend's pizza was done and then my pizza was burnt or something. I saw them chuck it into the trash. 

So my pizza, after being remade and cooked again, finished about 15 minutes after my girlfriend's pizza, so needless to say, her pizza was cold in comparison by the time we got back to the room. 

Anyway... Great flavors. Great pizza. However, I highly recommend that you eat the food right there. Wood fired thin crust pizzas tend to get really soggy (and cold) when placed in a box for a short period of time."}
{"text":"Boom. Great pizza. Fair price. Awesome team of workers!"}
{"text":"Love the home made pizza not your regular pizza places everything was fresh just a little marinara sauce,real mosrella cheese and fresh herbs went in and order to go two 12\" pizza made in front of my face and 8 min I was out"}
{"text":"This place was sadly disappointing.

There is a lot you can do wrong with pizza toppings, so I usually choose on of the menu, when going to a new pizza place. They usually know what tehy are doing.

Starting simple, I decided on a Pepperoni on a crispy crust.. which wasn't the best idea.

The crispy crust was pretty soft on the first look. Lifting the first piece half of the slice bend down and the topings fell onto my plate. There was nothing crispy about this pizza at all.

At the end there were more topping leftovers on my plate than in my stomach. The pizza was overall wet and soggy. Probably due to too much tomato-sauce and fat from the mozzarella and salami."}
{"text":"I came here very excited to try the pizza. We each ordered our own pizza and the bill came out to a little under $50. For 2 people. This price would've been fine if the pizza was even a little good. 
Nope. It was very gross. 
It was wet which was disgusting and very hard to eat. I understand that this pizza requires forks and knives but there's no dough. We were only eating our toppings. I wish we could've gotten our money back because that was not worth it. We left still hungry. 
I tell everyone not to come here. And the casino itself JUST opened and it's filthy. This whole place needs to get it together. 
We won't be back even to gamble."}
{"text":"Fantastic,  I used to live in Naples Italy and I was amazed to see Napoli ovens and mozzarella di buffala pizza.  Very authentic but you must like neopolitan pizza.  This is not American or NY pizza.  So if you go there know that you are eating the original pizza."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great atmosphere and fresh ingredients. The food was delicious and at good prices!! Customer service is on point!! Everything is made to order. You literally watch them put your pizza together and tell them what toppings you want. This place is great, defiantly a place to check out and return too! Good job!!"}
{"text":"Slow service and messed up my order. No management in sight. The inmates are running the asylum. Pretty disappointed in the poor execution. Much different than the locations located in California."}
{"text":"I grew up in NYC, so when it comes to pizza, it better be good......so the wife and I ordered the Margarita and Bianca with no extra toppings plus the Greek salad. I have nothing negative to say about it...the crust had good flavor especially when its cooked towards the well side with fresh ingredients........to sum it up,  that's two (2) pizzas, two (2) large greek salads with zero (0) leftovers!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love pizza & this place delivered. Price wise is accessible unlike some restos in Vegas.  I liked the idea of watching your pizza being prepared in front of you. Staff is friendly & the vibe is cool. The ingredients are quality & loved the wood oven taste.  If you're passing on the strip do go in & try it."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time to eat at 800 Degrees and certainly not the last. I had the Neopolitan crust and the Quattro Fromaggi toppings. 

The pizza was served very hot,  straight from the oven and the flavor was fantastic. Unfortunately,  I could not eat the whole pie. 

I highly recommend this place to any pizza lover who finds them self here in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I was hungry and wanted pizza. I thought this place looked good. First of I wanted the thin crispy crust. Apparently it's on the menu but they do not have it. I then orders the Tartufo pizza. Its they one with truffle oil mushrooms roasted garlic and Arugula. They barely put any mushrooms on and when I asked for more it was a 1.50 more. I got the pizza and the bread sauce and cheese had no taste. I had the sbarro in Monte Carlo earlier and it was a 1000 times better. So after paying $16 for a pizza I was very disappointed . Save money and go somewhere else. By the way the staff seemed very apathetic and looked like they hated being here!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: service and restaurant as a whole get 5 stars, but the food gets 4. 

Premium ingredients, clean restaurant, comfortable environment, and exceptional and speedy service. First time here and we loved it. Custom pizza and truffle cheese bread was pretty average. The gelato was really good and not overwhelmingly sweet. Will recommend chocolate and dolce de leche - most popular ones. 

Ranch lovers beware: they ain't got no ranch."}
{"text":"It boggles my mind how some people can go to an establishment with moderately high ratings and whine that the food \"has no flavor.\" 

Whatchu been smokin?!?!? 

I'm a food snob through and through. If the food tastes like cardboard I'll let you know. If the food lacks originality and/or flavor I will tell it like it is. 

This place. Is. Delicious!!! 

I ordered a margherita tonight. Cool guy with tats explained how the operation works. Very friendly! My food was out in about 5 min or less (at around 9pm on a Friday). Pizza was cooked perfectly. Just the right amount of char. Sauce was flavorful!! Perfect Neapolitan pizza!! Americanized a bit, for obviously, but worth the stop of the Vegas strip! 

Can't beat a delicious pizza for around $10! Knocks the more popular chains out of the water!!"}
{"text":"This place was not that great...project pie puts this place to shame. The guy putting the toppings on our pizzas kept messing up and we were all getting pretty frustrated but whatever he made a mistake. But then the pizza was so incredibly soggy and the second you pick it up everything fell off. The toppings tasted good but I was getting so annoyed with everything falling off that I just gave up and threw it away. Don't think I'll get pizza from here ever again"}
{"text":"This place is great if u like watery pizza and pizza that when u pick it up all the toppings slide off! Taste and seasoning is kinda bland. Not sure why this place is so busy. Probably location and price in comparison to other options. 

Just ordered a standard pepperoni pizza and it was ok but mostly because we were hungry and it was close. I've been to many places similar to this create your own pizza and this was the worst of them. They don't give crushed peppers and only a little bit parmesan cheese. 

The only pro was pizza was thin and light which is what I was looking for."}
{"text":"The Carni pizza Greek salad were delicious. My complaint is with the workers. They seem very slow/distracted. It took a few minutes for one worker to go in the back and grab toppings that were out. Then we stood at the ice cream bar for a few minutes without being acknowledged. Finally we walked over to the guy cutting pizza/yelling out order numbers and asked for help. He was the best worker here. Very friendly and helpful. After he scooped our ice cream, it took a couple minutes just to be rung out for the ice cream by the cashier. There was only one person paying before us."}
{"text":"Been looking forward to trying this place for a year now since we moved here. We finally tried it tonight after going to a show at Park Theater at Monte Carlo. It was okay. Nothing that I'm going to be having a hankering for ever. The pluses are that the crust is made fresh and tasted good. The meatballs were decent but lacked flavor. The homemade red sauce also lacked seasoning and flavor. Our first pizza still had the dough a little raw in the center. So they said they would remake it and bring it out to us. The second one still wasn't completely done in the center and this time she put about 1/2 the amount of toppings on it than the last guy, so we mainly just had bread, which was frustrating being that our total was almost $30 for one small pizza and 4 meatballs and 2 small pieces of bread. We had water to drink. Definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great place and definitely cheaper than other places on the strip. The pizza was excellent! I only gave them 4 starts because the ladies at the cadh registers were bitter and did not provide good service."}
{"text":"During a recent trip to Vegas we stopped here going by only a quick glance of their catchy sign. It was meant to be a late night snack and after one bite we realized this was one of the best pizzas we've ever eaten.  The entire trip, my boyfriend kept asking to go back every chance we got... We did go back one more time and it was even better than the first.  If you love fresh ingredients this is your place... Oh and it's ready in about 2mins so what's better than that?!?"}
{"text":"Last night after Blue man Group. We wanted to try 800 degrees.  We ordered 3 pizzas, each one was a menu item pizza with one ingredient added on. Not too hard to mess that up. It was not busy only three group in front of us. Took way too long, 15 minutes until they called our number.  Then the add on ingredients were not no the pizzas. They remade them and they  came out wrong again. So they made them for the third time. Came out right.  Now the pizzas crust was cooked perfect but the customer under the center was raw. Too much water on top of the pizza. Bad customer service.  Not coming back."}
{"text":"Really good pizza.  As far as the new pizza shops that have popped up all over the country that allow you to pick your toppings and watch them make it, this is the best I've had.  Plenty of toppings to choose from and everything very fresh.  A little pricy for a pie but its expected right on the strip.  Would definitely go back next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"pizza cooked at 800 degrees in 2 minutes. great service, atmosphere. reasonable prices but the flavor of my margarita  pizza was just Ok. kind of bland ."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Slow. Rude and not worth the wait. I'm so disappointed in this place."}
{"text":"Chipotle-like preparation of Italian pizza. Fast (done in about 90 seconds) and delicious! You choose a base pizza (margherita, blanco, pesto, etc) and then add toppings to your desire. They also have a gluten-free option for an extra $1.50. Truly customizable pizzas, or you can go with one of their specialties which already have ingredient combinations. Also note, the center is supposed to be moist or even soggy. That's the way the Italians do!

Sometimes they'll have a special pizza of the day for half off, which ends up being $6 for a full pizza! The pizzas are big enough for two to share or one really big meal.  Quite affordable, so it's great for an on-the-go meal while exploring the Strip or for a quick lunch break during the workday."}
{"text":"Went here last night with my family for dinner. Thought it would be a fairly quick and inexpensive meal for a family of 4. 

In actuality, it took longer than expected for the pizza designers to build each individual pizza. Everything costs extra money. I ordered a meatball pizza and he crumbled two small quarter size meatballs on the pizza. I asked for extra and he said he would have to charge an extra $1.50. Ridiculous!  My bill with no alcohol for a 4 pizzas was over $60. 

I guess what upset me the most was paying that much for pizza that tasted bad. None of our pizzas were cooked all the way thru. I asked customers in the table next to us and they also said their pizzas were soggy in the middle. Yuck!
Not coming back, ever!"}
{"text":"Finally, I got to try it here! I always walk by this place and finally craved a pizza during our stay in Vegas. I saw that they make their own dough and uses the freshest ingredients. Price for Vegas is about right but I wish it was a little cheaper! How it works is an assembly line from what kind of sauce on your pizza to pick your topping's. They do have select specialty pizzas. 

I chose their specialty 'Tartufd' pizza which was a white sauce base with lots of garlic, mushrooms and truffled cheese with arugula leaves as garnish. We also added pepperoni. The pepperoni made the pizza a little greasy though. All pizzas are the same size and can fit 2-3 people depending on your appetite. The thin crust was very good and really cooks in 90 seconds! Unbelievable? it came out quick! They do have special salads. We had their 'Gorgonzola' salad which had dried cranberries, Gorgonzola cheese, candied walnuts on butter lettuce with a light dressing. That was very good! Beer was good and served cold. 

I like that they sell beer here and open late! Beer and pizza are the best combos! Restaurant is spacious with modern decor; good for big groups, too. To find this place, it's right off the strip next to Monte Carlo hotel. You won't miss it walking the strip! I will most likely come back if craving a thin crusted pizza and cheese! Yummy in my tummy!  [37/100]"}
{"text":"I really hate writing bad reviews, but some things just have to be said. The pizza I had ordered was the Margherita with mushrooms and spinach. The pizza was really oily and soggy. The bread was also burnt. The extra one star is for the good customer service."}
{"text":"Well...

It took about 25 minutes to get my pizza because, even though I paid for it, no one ever made it. The manager apologized and offered free dessert. 

The pizza itself...is close but not great. The product was very wet and all the ingredients slipped off the dough. 

For the price, once they get out the kinks and make the product, this place will be decent. However, they're nowhere near there."}
{"text":"I came here tonight with a group of friends because this place advertises GLUTEN FREE PIZZA which if you look on their menu, is in BIG, FAT, BLACK LETTERS.  However, once we got there and asked the worker about the gluten free pizza, we were told that there's \"cross contamination\" with \"flour flying around\" and their gluten free pizza really isn't gluten free after all,  so if you're someone who has a true gluten allergy or Celiac disease, well, you're pretty much SOL!  The manager himself was pretty useless and not very helpful, telling us that since the pizza is cooked at 800 degrees the gluten is \"killed\"---absolute RUBBISH and just shows his ignorance in the matter."}
{"text":"Pizza was okay , but they were very unorganized and it took a long time for the food to be served."}
{"text":"I really did not like 800 degrees pizza. 
The first person that took out order was nice but the second person that continued with adding ingredients was rude. She did not want to add a second cheese even though we understood it would cost more. I get that the pizza cooks at 800 degrees but they leave it in the over for such a short amount of time that the crust gets burnt but the ingredients don't cook as well. The slices are really soggy and everything keeps falling from the pizza. It came out to about $16 for an individual pizza. For that price I could have bought 2 pizzas at pieology which is down the street in which you can include unlimited toppings and not be charged 1.50 for each. 
Seriously crappy pizza."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place as I was told it was like a more gourmet version of Pieology.  I was starving but my wife ate more recently so we shared a pizza.  First complaint here is the per topping cost.  That is one of the biggest pluses of the build your own pizza joints... being able to go crazy on the toppings choices without having to worry about being charged $2 to add a few leaves of fresh basil on your pizza.
So a quick bout of drunken math concluded we might as well try one of their available specialty pies.  Forgot the one we picked but it had rosemary and ham.  
The pizza was good but didnt live up to my expectations of being worth the price premium over Pieology.  Also I ate this while starving and plenty of whiskey flowing through my veins... a cardboard box should have tasted really good at this point."}
{"text":"Biggest tip trust the pizza makers! Cesar and Jeromy gave some great recommendations on Pizzas tropicale and BLT. Tropicale is a traditional Hawaiian Style pizza but the BLT was awesome and Lauren recommended adding a oil with crush pepper to really added to it. We also had the Carni which was a nice spin on the classic pepperoni."}
{"text":"We found this pizza shop while exploring the nearby hotels. They have gluten free pizza, which can be topped with any of their vegetables, sauce and cheese. We also chose a baby kale salad. Loved every bite! What a pleasant surprise, in the midst of so many mediocre chain food restaurants."}
{"text":"Staff hasn't been trained well.  Person in Salad Bar section had gloves on, but put her hair up in a bun with the gloves on (TWICE), and then didn't change her gloves before making the next salad.  Gross.  

This place has so much potential.  Just be sure that they handle food in a hygenic way!"}
{"text":"Pretty pricey for pizza. Each topping is like $1.50. I got their pizza for the day and it was pretty decent. I saw some pizza that had really burnt crust on them and I was scared mine was gonna turn out the same since I don't like mine burnt but mine turned out fine. Might give this place another try but wasn't that impressed."}
{"text":"Had stopped by after a night out..great that they were open! Pizza was great service was awesome! I got the tropical pizza really great flavor. My wife did a add the toppings and hers was also really good! Will come back soon!"}
{"text":"Great pizza fast and efficient service we will be back!!!

We got the margarita pizza and pizza zucca

Loved it all"}
{"text":"we recently stayed at the SLS...needed lunch and the restaurant I wanted to go to was dinner only.

we ordered a pizza to share plus a beet/buratta salad oh yes...and meatballs on the side =) 
crust was good...
all the food was quite yummy
price was fair...
service was slow....
all counter service...order/pay/pickup at counter 

i would eat here again if i stayed at the hotel"}
{"text":"Located just outside Monte Carlo, it has a nice location, nice atmosphere. Price is very reasonable for Vegas and most other places. I had a pizza, made to order. Staff was friendly, clearly explained their custom options. Pizza was hot and tasty. My only negative comment is they used too much olive oil - my pizza wilted from all the oil.
I did find the taste and price better than \"secret pizza\" at Cosmopolitan.

I recommend this, and will go back on my future visit."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a few times. Never disappoints. Customized pizza before your eyes. Tasty, fresh looking toppings. Ever gone to one of those chain 5 minute joints? This place blows them away. I only hope this place survives the rebranding of the Monte Carlo. The greatest improvement came when they changed from a few dollops of mozzarella to smaller chunks. Makes for better coverage of the cheese. This last time, mine could have used another 30 seconds in the oven - a few chunks of cheese didn't quite melt, but otherwise tasty. Don't forget the staff - I was engaged by 5-6 employees each one was pleasant, friendly and helpful. I recommend you give it a shot."}
{"text":"A little pricier than we thought it would be ($40 for 2 gluten free pizzas and 2 tap waters) but since each ingredient is priced and the gluten free was $1.50 extra it wasn't too bad. That said, this was probably the best gluten free pizza I've had. Got the Margherita base and added broccoli, roasted garlic, and 3 shredded cheeses. Awesome."}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza. It's a do-it-yourself place where you build your own toppings. Soooo many helpful staff there and the pizza itself was awesome! I'd just warn you to stay away from the garlic! Ha-ha."}
{"text":"We came here as part of the Nosh Las Vegas food tour. We had been to the location at Monte Carlo and enjoyed it, but coming as part of a tour forced us to try things that we wouldn't normally order. That's a good thing! We tried the sausage and peppers pizza (sausage, peppers and onions with red sauce) and the tartufo (truffle cheese, arugula and mushrooms). Both were really tasty. Each pizza would probably be good split between two people with a salad to share as well. You can't beat how fast the pizza cooks and that the wait is very short."}
{"text":"Maybe 3.5 stars. I was torn between the truffle and the Angry Bee. I asked for a recommendation and they said angry bee. I wasn't disappointed with the flavor. Excellent. I just wish the crust was crisper. I had to fold the small slices to eat them.

Great flavor just needed to be less soggy.  Maybe it was a Friday night.  I'll try it again"}
{"text":"The good is you can make your own choices for what you want on the small sized pizza. The ingredients are fresh and tasty. 
The pizza is wood fired. There are some other limited options to choose from if you do not want pizza. 
My son created a pizza with bacon, smoked Parmesan and mozzarella cheese that we shared. It amounted to 3 small pieces, which if you thought about it was probably equivalent to one piece of normal sized pizza. 
They deliver the food to the table you select.
The bad, it is super over priced for what you get. I would not recommend it on that fact alone. The price point is way high in their favor. You would think they would have you rather spend the cash on gambling, nope."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with a personal pizza. Located inside of SLS and couldn't be happier since I stayed here. Various selections of items that will not disappoint anyone. They have gluten free dough available for those who need gluten free."}
{"text":"This was my fourth visit to this place. And will for sure be my last. I came in tonight for the resorts social Sundays promotion where locals get 50% off the bill. My pizza was passed off to another customer on the assembly line. Ordered 2 salads and the ticket got lost. Ordered a side of broccolini and it was stone cold and WAY too spicy. I like heat but it wasn't edible. The best part of the meal was the complimentary ice water and when I walked out. This is the only venue on the property that doesn't seem to be able to get their act together. The entire team seems lost and definitely not a sign of management to be seen. A huge turn off and will most definitely be letting friends and family know about the poor service here."}
{"text":"I wondered about this place since there are couple locations in Los Angeles. This place is casual by ordering your pizza at counter and pay for it and pick up pizza at counter. It's nice ambiance with nice staff and self serve soda (high tech). My meal was around $15 with salad, classic pizza, soda. They accept MLife card for points."}
{"text":"Great original hand-made and fired pizzas, Carni was great.
Good size pizzas to share as a snack. 
Had a salad as well, was really good and made to order.
Friendly staff and they keep the place clean.
Outside seating is great for people watching on nice days."}
{"text":"Great priced pizza, especially for Vegas. There is usually always a line, but don't be intimidated, it moves rather quickly.

The ambience is very cool and chill. There is a lot of seating inside and some seating outside as well. You can either pick to make your own or choose one from the menu. If you choose to make your own, you have to pick a base and type of dough, then toppings which are $1.50 each. They have drinks, salad, and gelato besides pizza. 

Everything we ordered was delicious. I wish my pizza was a little bit more burnt so it would have a crispier crust, but it was nonetheless still good. You could taste the quality and freshness of their ingredients. Their Caesar salad was also delicious. Their gelato had interesting flavors and shoutout to the employee who was patient enough to let me try a little bit of every flavor because I was indecisive! I ended up getting two orders because I couldn't make up my mind.  Try it if you have space after the pizza!"}
{"text":"This pizza was the closest to being in Italy itself I have ever tried.  They take the raw pizza dough and prepare your pizza right in front of you, with fresh ingredients, and then cook it while you pay.  They offer create your own pizzas but in recommend their signature pizzas, they are to die for.  The truffle pizza was amazing!  Highly recommend.  I also tried the spicy pizza, and it was VERY spicy."}
{"text":"Ordered the Margherita pizza and chopped salad.  The pizza could have been cooked a little longer so the crust can be more crispy. 
The small chopped salad was good and the portion was filling. 
Tried this place out because it was a runners perk of the LV RnR Marathon."}
{"text":"Fresh dough containing only flour, salt, water and wild yeast, rolled to order right in front of your eyes, house-made toppings, proprietary fresh mozzarella, and cooked in 60-90 seconds an 800 degree almond-wood burning oven.  Authentic Neapolitan pizza.  Say no more.  Yummmmmm....."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner last night, and it was pretty good.  Chose 800 Degrees for 2 reasons: 1. My husband wanted pizza and since we were staying at the SLS Las Vegas anyway, why not.  2. We had a $25.00 food and beverage credit with our reservation.  So ya, 2 birds, 1 stone.  So let me say our pizza(s) were good.  Ordered 2, but we could have gotten away with 1 and then a salad.  My husband ate the rest of his after our night out though...lol!  800 Degrees is kind of pricey since all toppings that aren't on their limited menu of \"pre-designed\" pizzas are $1.50 per item.  Good pizza, but nothing that I'm dying to have again."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!! Their gluten free pizza crust was the best I've had since finding out I'm Celiac. They were very accommodating and took time to explain how the ordering process worked. The salads were made fresh and were top quality and ridiculously good! My husband and I ordered the tartufo (gluten free) pizza and I literally have not been able to stop thinking about it! I even pondered whether we had enough time to run down to grab a pizza to go to the airport! Great, not-too-expensive but insanely delicious place on the strip!"}
{"text":"Just like everything else in the SLS the service is crap. 
HOWEVER, 4because the pizza was tits. 
Build your own pie, bam, only regret was sharing it with my wife."}
{"text":"First things first.  This place is different.  It's like, build your own pizza pie. 
Second thing, the staff were all awesome and helpful.  Now for the pie: Choose your crust.  Then your sauce.  Follow your pizza down the line and add your toppings. 
By the time you order drinks, maybe a salad, your pizza is coming out of the oven hot and fresh."}
{"text":"This place is pretty Awesum
1. Customized pizza 
2. Variety of toppings
3.  Fast service 
4. Baked on wood fire"}
{"text":"800 Degree's just opened, so have to give them some time to get into the groove.  The service while friendly is very disorganized.  Ordered salads and pizza, and the pizza was done first.  This is in spite of having 8 staff literally standing around (there were only 6 people in the place).  The Pizza was nothing like the Westwood, CA main location. Sauce concentrated in center, so overly wet and could not lift up the pizza and eat easily, and could not keep toppings on pizza.  The Burrata was also a bit runny compared to the usual quality from the original.

Management and expeditors need to work on staff training if they want to preserve the unique and fabulous experience that keeps the CA original with lines out the door."}
{"text":"Very disappointing pre-marathon meal.  Pesto sauce tasted off, crust was soggy on both pizzas we got.  Think they were rushing through.  Meatballs were absurdly tiny portion for price -1 meatball cut in 4 pieces and very salty."}
{"text":"I've been to an 800 before. Chose this because the burger place at the SLS wasn't open. I was hungry after travel and didn't feel like walking anywhere.

The staff was super friendly. The chef was as well (they sort need to be since they're practically on top of the clientele). Super good pizza, cooked quickly and perfectly.

Good beer and pizza price point, too. Which was a good surprise."}
{"text":"Great pizza! I started with a Verde and added toppings down the line. Nice, crisp and cooked to perfection. I didn't have a salad but after seeing other people ordering them I wished I had. My husband also loved his specialty pizza with pepperoni and salami. Will definitely be back to this place again."}
{"text":"Horrible place.  I'd give it zero stars if I could.

Upon entering you see few options.  But it's a trick.  At the very bottom they say each topping above what they list as a basic option is an extra $1.50.

Not seeing this I added toppings as I like just like at Blaze or Pieology.  But those places don't charge extra for each topping.  You can load as much as you want of each for free.  The same pizza at Blaze or Pieology is about $8 before tax but with more toppings. 

Anyone who knows me knows I'll pay ANY price for food.  I don't bat an eye at $200 pp dinner bills.  But i expect value for anything I pay.  This personal sized pizza came out to be $21.45.  And while the price is daunting I wouldn't mind it if it tasted great.  

Needless to say it didn't.   It came out very oily and sour.   Like spoiled.  And yes it did result in severe stomach pain and several rounds of discomfort in the bathroom.   I will not detail further. 

Now I did ask how it came to be so much while I was in line and before I paid.  They pointed out the fine print at the very bottom of one of their massive signs AFTER the pizza was made. And I'm not the kind of douchebag to complain and have a new pizza made because I didn't know how something worked.

But it's just not clear how it works and is incredibly deceptive, especially with the proliferation of Chipotle style pizza places everywhere else.

Yes Vegas Strip eateries are expensive.  This I am well versed in frequenting places like Delmonico Cut STK Mastros Ocean Club Picasso Aureole Kabuto Raku Carnevino Gordon Ramsay etc.  But at least their menus are clear and the food isn't rancid, especially for a quick bite place like 800 degrees.

Don't go.  You've been warned.  Get a cheap bite at the cafe or somewhere else if you have to.  Anywhere else for the sake of your own intestines."}
{"text":"Super good Clay oven pizza, right around the corner from my hotel very convenient! I will definitely come back here when I visit  Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Have eaten here a few times. Like the selection of toppings, employees in the location have always been amazing ... not sure why the bottom of my crust is always soggy."}
{"text":"Chopped salads are yummmmmy. Perfectly dressed (not overbearing like most places) and the large is literally enough to feed 4. The pizza is super crispy and fresh."}
{"text":"I had been dying to try 800 degrees at the SLS and finally had a free day to get there.  I was not disappointed.  the Pizza was perfect,  the salad was yummy and the service was fast and courteous and friendly.  

My friend had a pre-assorted mushroom truffle pizza.  And although truffle oil is not my favorite, her and other of my friends who like truffle, rave about it.  

I made my own, with the Bianca white base (I requested no garlic as I don't care for it).  The Bianca is olive oil, mozzarella, oregano and garlic normally.  Then I added, a raw egg, grilled chicken and fresh basil.  OMG it was out of this world!  Cooked perfectly with my egg just right with a little runny yolk to dip in, but no runny whites.  The crust was perfect blend of slightly crispy but soft, not burnt. 

I've eaten at Novacento several times and this 800 Degrees crust is 1000 times better.  its more fluffy and light and easy to bite.  The toppings also seemed fresher and lighter and they have more base sauce options.  

We shared the small $5.00 Gorgonzola salad.  Its quite large for a $5 salad and the butter lettuce and toppings of cranberries, feta, and walnuts were great.  The dressing was light and fresh and one of the best I've had.  

There was easily accessible nice glass plates and real silverware (not plastic), and pre-made to go boxes for left overs.  They thought of everything, for a quick, affordable nice experience.

My only tiny complaint is,  clean the empty tables faster so you don't have to select an open table based on what is clean,   and level the table feet on any tables that are wobbly.

When we were done, the pizza chef made a point to confirm if we were happy and everything tasted good.  

If you're a vegas local, one sunday a month is 50% off for locals.  A must do!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and had a great experience each time. It's set up similar to Subway, where you go down a line and tell them what you want on your pizza. Different choices of crusts (including a gluten-free crust), sauces, and toppings. Lots of options you don't often find.

Service is quick. Each time I've been here, by the time I've paid, my pizza is ready."}
{"text":"This place is great!! Thank you ivan for helping me choose a pizza, he was very friendly and I can tell he is one of the best of the staff there, he baked my pizza to perfection"}
{"text":"Pizza with a view! I'm definitely one for people watching and the Las Vegas strip has to be some of the best people watching in the world. This place was perfect because it was a nice big patio right in front of the Monte Carlo to sit and watch while also enjoying your meal.

Food wise it's pretty good too. It's got that make your own pizza feel very similar to pieology. We went with the Bianca base on traditional crust with mushrooms, garlic, sausage, and half roasted tomatoes. One pizza was definitely enough for us to share. We also had the prosciutto and mozzarella starter. The pizza turned out very well and was perfectly crisp. I recommended adding their fresh red peppers on pretty much anything. My favorite through was the starter. All the ingredients were super fresh and delicious. I just wish they had some vinegar and oil to top it off with. 

The only downside to this place is that it gets super busy and the line can get pretty long to order. It also was a little confusing since they hand you a separate receipt just for your pizza that you then take to the middle register to check out, kinda weird but guess that's their process.

I would recommend this place to pizza lovers who also enjoy a nice view of the strip!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently stopped here for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised. The concept is very similar to Pieology but with more exquisite ingredients such as truffle oil and fresh mozzarella.

We decided to go with a pre set pizza, the Trafunto (?) I think it was called. Turned out to be very good but I wish we would have put some type of meat on it like chicken or bacon. We also had the meatballs as a side. They were good but I a little bit dry for my liking.

Overall I thought this place was good, a little bit pricey but worth it for the ingredients used."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to trying this place and was sorta let down. Ordered the Bianca and a pepperoni. The pizza flopped over when we folded it and and the crust was so thin it got a hole through it. Pizza had good flavor though. Salad I had the dressing was really strong. Nothing I would run back to"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza I've ever had. The ingredients were so fresh they looked like they had just arrived. The staff was extremely friendly and made the food so fast I barely had time to enjoy the beautiful decor. I did not expect to be blown away from a place I went to for a quick bite. Definitely one of the reasons to stay at SLS."}
{"text":"I'll go with a 3.5 rating rather than a 4, but because the flavors were so outstanding I'll bump them up to the flat 4.  Service was confusing, not in a bad way, in a \"everything looks and sounds like I want to cram all of it in my mouth right now\" way.  Too bad they have the entire fixins laid out in front of you which propelled me to add sausage to the quattro formaggi.  That much cheese...this kid needs some meat to make the magic work and I anticipated saltiness which some sweet sausage might help balance but more on that to come!

We ordered 2 apps and 3 pizzas.  The first to arrive were the Quattro Formaggi and the Zucca.  The Zucca was the one my dining partner heard about and it was \"a must.\"  It looked gorgeous and I decided to nosh that one first.  Well played and well ordered.  Fresh mozz, butternut squash, caramelized onion, bacon...SCORE!!!  If I remember correctly neither of us even knew there was bacon on it, but if you say bacon I put on facepaint and a loin cloth and dance around an open fire gratefully praying to pagan gods.  True story.  No it's not, but close.  

The flavors were fantastic.  FAN-TASTIC.  So much so I completely ignored the fact it was fairly oily, and incredibly limp.  Limp as in pick it up and it droops down like grandpas brown polyester pants.  My grandpa doesn't wear those but I heard yours does!  Heeey-oooh!  All said and done this pie was tops, disregarding my very recent nitpicking and douchebaggery.

Next I put on my water wings and dove into the quattro formaggi WITH sausage.  If salt had a fist I just got punched by it.  I am not down, by any means, with this consistent socially acceptable wave of,\"Salt, salt, salt, salt\" BUT.....this was saltiness from mucho cheese and I mucho like mucho cheese.  If it was the plain pie as is, I'm not sure if I would've enjoyed it as much.  We had the sausage which helped plenty, but, I think, to send it over the top, possibly some pepperoni and/or chili flakes to add some heat or pepper to counteract that wonderful cheese and make a harmonious balance of divinity would've been the best choice. As the previous pie, oily and limp.  But taste made up for it.

The meatballs and the Margherita came out.  Meatballs....maaaaaaan...the meatballs came out in a little silver whatchamadoodle, like straight out of the oven.  Gorgeous bright red marinara (the sauce, btw, killer) and the tops of the balls were burnt, not brown, but black, and that black....ooooh boy, I'm telling you.  Sent dem balls to the stratosphere...as in the sky, not the hotel/casino.  Meatballs are outrageous and a must order.  MUST ORDER!!!  The Margherita had enormous bits of tomato.  Multi colored and quartered.  This one, also, unfortunately, limp and soggy, but like the others, flavor stood out more.

And now the sad part of our story.  I made the mistake of trying the burrata last.  After I ate enough to lose some interest in food.  In this was a great folly.  The burrata was something I would've enjoyed leaps and bounds more if I ate it first as I was supposed to.  Luckily, I'm still alive and can do things properly on my next go.  

I loved the hotel and this is a great place for grab n go dinner or lunch.  Texture fails but taste dons body armor with shield and sword and wins out.  Definitely on the cheaper side as well.  3.5 to a 4.  Can't argue with the place."}
{"text":"Came here to try some real Neapolitan pizza and I wasn't disappointed! The pizza is made right in front of you and the staff even helps recommend items.  Very friendly staff and knowledgeable. Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Nice find and tasty Pizza , we all enjoyed and it was cooked quickly. Friendly staff . I like the various options of base(sauce) , ingredients and dough. Recommend a visit if in the area."}
{"text":"Very overpriced! The pizza was good, but everything was \"an add-on\". They did not have the crispy crust listed on the menu. They forgot to give us the prosciutto on our pizza and the artichokes on the salad after paying extra for them. This was all at dinner time. Lastly, when you pay that much for pizza, they should at least deliver it to your table."}
{"text":"On the BLVD plaza outside, in front of the Monte Carlo, snag a satisfying pizza made to order and cooked blasingly fast in their signature high-temperature oven.

Zucca pie was light and tasty:  butternut squash, bacon, caramelised onion mozzarella on bianca (white) sauce.  It's a good sweet and savoury option at 800 Degrees.  They have a plethora of other combos too and great ingredients.

Fountain soft drinks cost a few buckeroos, but it is all you can drink.  An integrated beverage machine features a myriad of mix-and-match brands and flavours.  I always love the option of putting a touch of vanilla or peach or strawberry etc. in cola and ginger ale.

800 Degrees also offers a deal that's tough to beat.  Check their ig to see what \"Pizza of the Day\" it is, and mention it to get your order for half off.  Quite the bargain for high quality pizza in Vegas, L.A., Japan or even Dubai."}
{"text":"Great disappointment. We used to go to the other strip location  but unfortunately they closed down so we decided to come here. The pizza was too thin and overcooked definitely not Naples style. The prosciutto on my husband's pizza was sliced too thick he did not enjoy his pizza at all. Definitely not worth the $30 for two pizzas and 3 toppings"}
{"text":"Clearly not the same pizza place as the other 800 degree pizza locations we ve  tried. Their pizza tasted better in Westwood and at the Monte Carlo hotel. We ordered the pizza of the day and we were totally disappointed. To put more details- pizza was not cook properly and came out a little soggy. Potd was Margherita pizza with pepperoni and sun fired onions. The place wasn't even busy for a weekday at the SLS hotel."}
{"text":"What can I say?? Average pizza, very soggy but juicy. This is a great location for a fast pizza for lunch or when you are hungover, but other than that there are so many other places out there! The price range is between $12-$15 dollars. We ordered the Cappriosa and they had run out of ham!! Whaaat?? How is it possible? A pizzeria running out of one of the major toppings! I was definitely disappointed about it. We also got the Chopped salad which was just ok. 
The atmosphere is really nice. The decor is fresh and attractive. They play top music hits making the place even more fun. Their concept is an assembly pizza line. You pick your crust, your topics, your sauce and your pizza will be ready in 90 sec! The concept is good, efficient and fast. I just wish I could say more about their food."}
{"text":"Pizza was not cooked enough, crust was completely soggy and mushy in the middle. Took forever to make my friends salad. At least it was a cute atmosphere and they had a decent beer selection."}
{"text":"Love love love ..... pizza and meatballs !!! Truffle pizza AMAZING!!!! U must try it!!!! The meatballs super moist"}
{"text":"My visit took place on Jan 03, 2015. I visited the location on Las Vegas Boulevard, adjacent to the Monte Carlo Resort. (I understand that there is another separate location at the SLS Hotel & Casino.)

So let's start with the positives:

It has a great location facing the Las Vegas Strip. It has indoor and outdoor seating. The interior is well decorated. And I feel that the pricing is very reasonable, when you consider the other eating options on The Strip. Also note that one of the features of this chain is that you can \"customize\" you own pizza.

But with regards to the food.... Personally I can only give \"an average\" rating based on my one meal.  I ordered the sausage with caramelized onions, and did not ask for any special customization. I wanted to see what their interpretation was. The pizza was beautiful to look at. But I prefer a dryer, crispier crust. The rim of my pizza's crust was crispy--but the bottom (flat area) of the crust was \"wet\". 

Maybe this is what a traditional Neapolitan pizza is supposed to be like, and I am used to \"American style\" pizza (?). The European tourist seemed to enjoy their meals."}
{"text":"I'm already a fan of the franchise, having eaten at the SLS location here in Las Vegas, as well as the Santa Monica and Westwood locations in L.A.

The idea of $11 QSR pizza from a wood fired oven is fabulous. In practice, it makes for a mouth watering, shareable, thin crust pie from heaven!

My secret off-menu pie is a \"Bianca add Marinara and Basil\" which ends up tasting like a cross between a Garlic-herb-EVOO and a Margherita.  My eight year old swears by the crushed meatballs on her Margherita. 

Bottom line: our family makes it here once-per-month and is rarely disappointed."}
{"text":"Good fast, food.  Portions are small.  Ingredient quality is high for a fast, casual restaurant.  Should be open later.  It's Vegas, after all."}
{"text":"Would give zero case they suck ass i mean come on what fuckin pizza place runs out of ranch fuckin amatures.   . I dont fuck with places like this ...  i give zero stars ... management  get on top of your shit idiots ..."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this conveniently located pizzeria inside SLS Las Vegas Hotel. Let's just start by saying, I'm from Chicago, so I'm not easily impressed when it comes to other pizzerias when I'm away from home...but I digress. I ran into four women, varies ages, but strolling together through the casino, carrying individual pizza boxes from 800. I stopped one of the ladies to ask her about the pizza and she went into a hallelujah chorus about it...and the other three joined the choir. I didn't know them, but based on their enthusiasm alone, I decided to give it a try. The ordering process was easy enough. There are pre-selected topping choices, or you can create you own. You start with the crust, select a sauce, proteins and topping/fixings. I ordered the sausage and caramelized onion pizza. They restaurant has a wood-fired brick oven, so the waiting time was less than 10 mins tops. When I got to my room, my mouth was watering with anticipation, so I opened the box and dove right in. I'm not sure what all the hype was about, but this was the most tasteless, seasonless pizza I had ever eaten. Although my pie contained fresh mozzarella, it wasn't melted uniformly. The sausage was ok, but did not adhere to the cheese, so most of the meat just rolled right off. The crust...and this is how I judge all pizzas..was disappointing.  Although it wasn't thin to my personal liking, it was thin enough, but soggy, perhaps due to the thin sauce. This experience really disappointed me, not only because I was really hungry, but I felt this property should be able to offer award-winning Neapolitan-style pizza.  It hurts me to say, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Very good pizza at very good (for the strip) prices. 

We decided on 800 degrees on a whim, we were heading to a hockey game (go Knights) and thus couldn't spend too much time on food beforehand, and the place we were originally planning on going to was closed. The smell of fresh pizza led us to 800 degrees and I'm very glad it did.

You enter the restaurant and begin your pizza journey by choosing a signature pizza or a base to create your own. They roll out the dough for your pizza and add sauce (if any) and fresh mozzarella then add toppings. There was about 15-20 choices for toppings, so there is definitely something to please everyone. After your pizza is put together it gets put in line to go into the oven and you pay for the pizza and you can add on an appetizer, salad, or dessert at the register. Once your pizza is in the oven it only takes about 1 to 1 1/2 minutes to be cooked to perfection. Our pizza was done before we were finished paying for it. 

We added on an anti pasti plate, which was a good choice, and something I'd recommend if you enjoy salami and cheese. 

Our pizza only cost about $13 and for the two of us to eat here it was about $30 which is pretty reasonable for the strip and makes this a place I'm going to come back to."}
{"text":"We had the Quatro Formaggi in the Bianca style. It was delicious. Totally worth stopping in and getting a pizza. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is a kids dreams! Few things are better than a make your own pizza joint after stumbling around in Vegas. 

Prices are about $20 for a customized pizza, of course it depends on toppings. They have a ton of options and I was quite pleased (and conflicted) on my selections. 

Service was great, pizza was great, and they have gelato!"}
{"text":"Great flavors and they have gluten free.  This is our first time here and the raves we heard about are all true.  My son is picky with pizza but with this place he loves the taste. They have one location by our house so we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"As slow as they were last night, you would have thought they would have been more excited to take our order. Finally, someone decided we might want to order and came over. 
Once we ordered, the process went pretty fast for our to go order. We like the pizza and the truffle cheese bread was really good.
Located inside of SLS, it is very convenient to where we live. I'm sure we will be back... maybe for eat in next time."}
{"text":"I love the Westwood location in LA. It's fast, clean, and efficient. This location is none of the above. I went 2 times during my stay at the SLS and each time the food was decent but they never had enough workers. One worker kept putting on gloves to make the pizzas, when wearing the gloves while ringing orders into the computer system. She also used a dirty rag to wipe down the preparation area - all while wearing gloves. What's the point of the gloves?!?!"}
{"text":"Pizza has good flavor, but the fresh Mozzarella needs some of the moisture squeezed out. It makes the pizza soggy in places.  Had margarita pizza with mushrooms, caramelized onion, and pepperoni and Antipasti. Add glass of wine and a beer and it was $45. Concept would work better as a sit down restaurant. The stand in line and order idea doesn't work. Lots of bottle necks in the line."}
{"text":"Super tasty pizza and salads!  We had a MyVegas deal for credit here and wow, it allowed us to really order a LOT and to get a sense of flavors.

The food!!!
Tartufo pizza = yumms!  
My friend had a create your own which she liked
she also ordered the truffle appetizer bread but she said it left something to be desired.  I didn't try it, so I cannot comment on it.
We also had two salads; I didn't mean to get a \"create-your-own,\" but when I asked them about the topics, the lady started putting them in a bowl and then it became a created salad. I liked it, though. She didn't skimp on the toppings, which I appreciated.

The service:
They're all very nice but some employees started having random conversations with customers and sometimes it held up the line.  I get it, though.  It gets kinda rough to just make the pizzas and stand there, but I felt bad for those behind me because we were talked to and before us, ther was another customer they were talking to.

I would return, though.  Nice take on upscale make-your-own pizza concoction.  Ingredients are bourgie, which I appreciate :)  I must have eaten something truffle at every place I went to on my trip to Vegas and I can definitely say I love how this place continues the truffle craze with the truffle bread (if that's your cup of tea) and the tartufo pizza."}
{"text":"I discovered 800 Degrees after a few stays at SLS (it is tucked away, far from the entrance) and now it is my \"go to\" restaurant whenever I'm in Vegas. The crust is divine and all the ingredients are fresh and tasty. Try the Margherita with yummy basil. 

Oh, and unlike the $70 pizza rumored to be sold at Rock in Rio USA, this place right across the street is around $10 - $15, depending on your toppings. WELL WORTH THE SHORT WALK! 

Best of all, the staff is super kind and interactive with the customers."}
{"text":"I wanted some pizza and I was in the downtown Vegas area. We found this spot and we LOvED it! I highly recommend this location. I was very satisfied."}
{"text":"Great fresh ingredients in tasty pies made to order right in front of you in just a few short minutes. 800 Degrees is a perfect place to stop for a delicious pizza that's not greasy at all and won't make you feel like you have a ton of bricks in your gut. The prices are completely reasonable, which is a nice break from the usual gouging you get on the strip. Really nice place to stop in for a bite."}
{"text":"I had some friends from Jersey visiting Las Vegas and they text me that they were at this place and I have never even heard of it when I walked in and saw the set up it looks kind of like a Chipotle restaurant where they put together your pizza and you can read off the menu and then there's the sitting area inside and outside basically they stick the pizza in an 800Â° oven so it comes out fairly quickly Peters are about $10 a good size

I don't have the employs there with the nicest part they were all smiling and very attentive and I noticed that they cleaned up the tables really quickly I had a really nice time when I was there and I never would've heard of it had my friends my picked it out"}
{"text":"I think this place is super cool it's kind of like a chipotle but with pizza. 
You can sit out on the patio on the strip stairs or eat inside. 
It's a bit fast food. 
But the staff behind the counters are very nice. 
This is a cool place if you are on a budget in Las Vegas. 
I've only eaten there once"}
{"text":"Was a little tentative due to the fact that each topping is $1.50, but my feelings were quelled after realizing how amazing the ingredients were.  I had a simple verde pizza with 1 add-on of chicken sausage.  It was around 10$ and so much better than Sbarro or any other fast food pizza.  The restaurant is also beautiful with sturdy chairs, nice clean tables, real silverware, and ceramic plates.  It's fast, easy, affordable, and super nice!  Was happily surprised.  More expensive, but better quality than Pieology for sure."}
{"text":"I had the Bianca (white pizza) and my husband had the Carni (meat pizza). They were everything you can expect in Neapolitan pizza. The crust was soft and chewy. The sauces were light and airy. Both pizzas were ready in less than 20 minutes. One pizza is enough to share but we wanted to try more than one kind on our trip here because the toppings looked so great. Definitely worth trying on your trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. Possibly the best I've ever had. Had the Tartufo with extra cheese and add chicken. WOW!!!  Def come back here!!!"}
{"text":"Build your own pizza in a fancy Vegas kind of set up. We have a better chain in CA. The pricing is confusing and also the options for toppings were limited. It's different from most pizza places so worth a try but no more..."}
{"text":"We were having a staycation at the sls, the bf was on an anything with truffle oil mood (I know it's all chemicals but I didn't have the heart to tell him).  We ordered the Tartufo pizza which had truffle oil,  roasted garlic, mozzarella, mushrooms and arugula. The pizza is made Subway style with the guy putting the toppings in front.  It really did only a few minutes to cook.  The pizza crust was crispy and a little soggy in the middle which is ok since Napolitano pizza is not that bready.  The overall toppings blended well. Definitely a winner. ..  :p"}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas you will ever try! Everytime i decide to brin gsomeone here that is visiting from out of town, i like to describe it as the Subway of pizzas. Meaning when you get there you choose whether you want their original crust or the thin crust, i would go with original crust because the thin crust is almost as thin as a tortilla. Then you can tell them if u want one of their specialty pizzas on the menu, or you can start with the base of a Margherita, which includes sauce, mozzarella, olive oil and basil, and then you can add any other toppings you want, and just like subway, they are laid out so you can see them. And it's a lot of topping choices. 

The best part of all, they serve beer! and gelato! But the pizza really is amazing, i would reccomend sharing one pizza between two. It hits the spot but doesn't leave u too full. But if you are a really hungry man, then maybe you should get your own."}

{"text":"I got the verde pizza and it was very unappetizing all around- it was too oily, the dough was extremely soggy but the crust was all burnt- if I wasn't tasting oil, I was tasting charcoal. Was expecting a lot better and left very disappointed."}
{"text":"Very thin crust pizza. I ordered the margarita base with two toppings. With all the oils they add loaded the pizza down and you couldn't eat the pizza by hand or the toppings and cheese slides off. Very messy, I went through about 30 napkins. If I come here again I will ask for very light sauce, no extra olive oil, and cook it well done. On the plus side it was quick to come out and tasty. I would probably pick another pizza place over this one."}
{"text":"This is the worst place ever on the face of the earth. Horrible food and worst customer service. Joe was one pathetic guy who was unwilling to do anything about burned and tasteless watery pizza. Don't waste your money here. You will regret it."}
{"text":"This location is very dirty. I was able to write my name on top of the Ice Tea maker. There is dust everywhere. I watched as employees where checking there phone and then starting to make pizza. I was just amazed as everyone stood around on a slow day and was not cleaning."}
{"text":"Alex was great helped me multiple times same for Jose both great food was just perfect
management runs tight ship my family thoroughly enjoyed!"}
{"text":"I came here with high expectations. I found the staff very friendly and helpful. I was quickly greeted by a nice girl with pigtail braids who took my food order. I ordered both the Margarita pizza and the Sausage & Pepper pizza. I found the pizzas reasonably priced for Vegas, although the soda being almost $5 seemed a little high. 

The Very low quality of pizza is what gives this place only ONE-Star. I found the pizza to be soggy in the middle. The sauce was not to my liking either. It reminded me of the stuff in the spaghetti-o can.  Overall, I found the pizza absolutely nasty. I tossed out most of it. I wont be checking this place out again."}
{"text":"This place is an over priced Piology.  The pizza was ok, but not $42 worth. Ordered 2 pizzas with 3 toppings. Way over priced. Suggest going to fast food plaza across street."}
{"text":"This was an unsuspecting treat. The wood burning pizza oven and chef were right on point."}
{"text":"Pizza was amazing
Service at counter sucked
When it gets close to closing time, these Mexicans want to leave ......the whole ordering system and receipt is quite sketchy"}
{"text":"Prices are really nice for Vegas: about 10 USD for a pizza assembled right in front of you. We tried the Pizza Bianca and topped it up with ricotta to try to reproduce the white pie at Secret Pizza. The pizza was garlicky and the crust was quite good, but the ricotta tasted more like mascarpone (on the sweet side), so it wasn't close to the heavenly ricotta bites from Secret Pizza. But it's quite decent and worth trying out and trying other combinations and toppings.

The pizza cooks super fast at 800 degrees, you can count 20 secs and it'll be ready."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had so far! Make your own or order what they have on the board. I love the cheese they put on there and the sauce. It's a light and healthy pizza. If you think secret pizza at cosmo is great, must try this place out!"}
{"text":"Really good crust. Without a doubt the best part of the pizza. They went s little heavy on the sauce for my liking.  I enjoyed and will return."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE! Save your money for the slots! One pizza for a man goes for $20 which is outrageous compared to what you get! I would rather eat a little Caesars $5 pizza and you would get way more! Don't get me wrong I ate the whole pizza, only because it was edible. Everything that was on the pizza had no flavor at all! I bought 2 small/medium pizzas a soda and a beer which was $42.07 which was stupid. This place needs to go out of business."}
{"text":"My friend and I were staying at the SLS, and after walking along the strip with most restaurants closed, we just decided to go back to the hotel to eat. This one's located right next to 2 clubs in the SLS so it was super convenient and open late. We got there at about 1 AM.
We wanted to try the burrata but they had sold out. We couldn't finish a whole pizza so we decided to order the truffle cheese bread and the antipasto plate. They were huge for the price. i really enjoyed the cheeses and meats on the antipasto although it was kind of weird that the cheese was shredded. 
The truffle bread was amazing and super cheesy. 
I've heard some of the pizzas were really amazing so next time I would like to try one. I wish they could make smaller pizzas though because I'm not really a pizza person to begin with. 
When we went there weren't that many customers so the workers were really nice and even brought our food to our table."}
{"text":"DIY pizza, who can pass that up?? 

My sister is obsessed with this place so when we came to Vegas last year and found out there was an 800 degrees that recently opened, we had to go! And during our most recent trip, it was definitely a stop we had to make yet again. 

There are a couple of bases to choose from for your pizza but I went with the margherita. Each topping is priced at a little over a dollar so keep that in mind when you're choosing what to pile on top of your pizza. Their toppings bar is extensive, and there's just so much quality items you can pick from. Plenty of veggies, cheeses, and meats along with many more for your liking. Just make sure your pizza won't be too heavy when choosing your toppings or else you'll be eating your pizza with a fork and knife, which is usually the way to go at these types of pizza establishments. I tend to go overboard with what I put on my pizzas. 

The pizzas are wood fired which gives it the perfect smokey flavor and slight crunch to the toppings. The crust stays fluffy, and your entire pizza creation just comes together so nicely in the end. Love this spot, and we'll definitely be coming back when we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick bite after walking aimlessly down the Las Vegas strip. Was hungry and didn't want to search everywhere for a meal so looked to my right and saw this joint. Wandered in, and was greeted by the pizza dude. I selected the create your own pizza option , and got the basil pesto sauce and added several toppings ($$$). Paid the hefty price of ~$20 for a personal pizza and was hollered for a few moments after sitting down. I grabbed my pie and immediately smiled; it looked gorgeous. I took a bite and boy it was good. Only thing is the price, man. $1.50/ topping - perhaps a pre-made pie would've been a better idea."}
{"text":"Great pizza order it crispy don't go crazy with the toppings and you can't go wrong friendly staff shout to Marcus awesome service all the time"}
{"text":"My favorite Pizza  Place on the Vegas Strip. Will visit again. The service is friendly,fast and great quality food. Lots of options"}
{"text":"Visited this location tonight for our last evening in town. We chose it because every time we would pass by it smelled amazing and it definitely didn't disappoint. I ordered the Bianca (white pizza base) with chicken and artichoke hearts. Holy hell, y'all. It was amazing. Like the warmth you get in your stomach when you take that first bite of your favorite comfort food. 

Service was excellent and it's pretty much exactly like other posters have said; it's a chipotle for pizza. Definitely will return next time in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We thought the pizza was very good but so expensive.  We're from New Jersey and Blaze Pizza has just hit our state.  When I saw that this place has the same concept we decided to try it.  Appreciate the vegan and gluten free options.  The reason I gave 3 stars is the fact that any extra toppings, be it a little bit of onion or some meat, is $1.50 per topping.  At Blaze back in NJ there is no charge.  So lunch for 4 with 4 fountain drinks cost almost $80.  At Blaze in NJ it usually costs around $45.  So I would basically say this place is pretty much a rip-off."}
{"text":"Okkaaayyyyy pizza....

With that said if you have no choice this is the place for you.
I am not a fan of the pizzaiolo who made my pizza last night, didn't took off her wedding ring and continued to make it.

THIS PART OF THE REVIEW IS FOR PRINCESSES ONLY.........
They have the shittiest silverware, I know that you're supposed to eat with your hands, except for this girl!  I don't think their knife is a knife, I always have a hard time cutting my pizza but of course that's none of their business.

If there is one thing I like that is they give decent amount on their salads!"}
{"text":"Seriously have some very good pizza for a very reasonable price. Came here twice in a day because it was so damn good. The margharita, and verde pizza both amazing - can't go wrong with either ."}
{"text":"Made to order brick oven pizza is great!  Staff is cool and fun!  Great location"}
{"text":"These guys deserve more than five stars. In this restaurant everything is really creative. Name(800 degrees) comes from oven and it's really fast. You pick everything for your pizza however you want and they cook it in 30 mins. Staff is polite and helpful. If you go there, i'll give you a tip for you pozzt's base. You should get their classic napolitan one. It's legendary."}
{"text":"The Verde pizza with corn and ham is awesome! My second time here. Good crust and ingredients!"}
{"text":"Ehhhhh. The pizza was in fact mushy and felt under cooked. I had Pieology (Another pick your own pizza business) expectations... 

Another thing to note was that the staff kept up conversation with each other only pausing for a second to ask me what toppings I wanted.... 

Seven employees standing around talking to one another? I wonder if their boss knows about this. 

Also they were out of soda lids... Alrighty then."}
{"text":"We stopped and ate here while staying at the Monte Carlo. I'm from Boston, I'm not a big fan of the \"DVD\" style of pizza. This stuff was GREAT!!! Fresh dough and ingredients, you pick 'em. Fair prices and 2 MINUTES to cook the pizza. This good easily be your best stop on the strip!!! Highly recommended, Two Thumbs Up!!!!"}
{"text":"I truly believe that in today's world of social media, it is vital for a place of business, that is susceptible to reviews that the entire world can see and can determine whether or not that business is successful, to be very responsive to it's clientele's concerns.

My initial review for 800 Degrees was just a so-so food experience.  Great place, average pizza.  But as I love pizza, I am always willing to give a place another try if I think there is great potential.  This place definitely has great potential. Fantastic location and great personnel.
Management has invited me to return in hopes of improving my dining experience with some recommendations and I truly am impressed with their due diligence to satisify their customers, thus the 5 stars.
I will be returning to 800 soon and will follow-up with a dining review.  Looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Love! Fast. Fresh. Garlic.  Fire Oven. Amazing Ingredients. Kind staff.  Outdoor seating. I can imagine my vegetarian friends would pleased with selections of toppings to choose from.  Im coming back to 800 degrees"}
{"text":"I happened to try this at their location at Coachella in the craft beer garden.  This was probably one of the top 3 things I've had to eat at the festival.  So I was very happy to see that we have a location back home here in Vegas.  Will definitely be coming soon to fulfill my Mushroom Tartufo craving.  Soooo much YES with all the flavors in that pizza.  from the truffle cheese, roasted garlic, wild mushrooms, and arugula.  I wish I had that pizza in my hands right now. (^_^).  Can't wait to try their truffle cheese bread and other things from their menu."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza in all of Las Vegas. You can't beat these pizzas made right in front of you. You can see them stretch your dough to order and they use fresh mozzarella. It's a Neapolitan pizza and people assume it's like blaze or pieology, it's not. The dough is really thin and the workers let you know you shouldn't add more than 3 toppings or put extra sauce because it will get very soggy. They do have a crispy crust if you wanted to pile high on your toppings which cost $1.50 each. Anyway, I love the white pizza! It doesn't have the red sauce so it's really not soggy. If I get the margherita pizza, I ask for very light sauce. The toppings here are great, the spicy salami is the best. They have a pizza called the angry bee and it has the spicy salami, chills, and honey! It's the perfect combo of sweet and spicy. I like the Neapolitan crust. It's nice and chewy and has great flavor. The crispy crust is ok if you like the cracker like crust."}
{"text":"The most horrible service on the planet... wanted to order food at 10 pm this evening, was a short gentleman with greasy hair at the register, completely ignored me didn't acknowledge me... nothing!.. and they weren't even busy, three customers sitting down at the most.  if you don't like working in the service industry, than don't! I'm currently a guest in this hotel and the food choices with limited room service is already an inconvenience. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Who knew you could get a delicious meal on the strip for such a great price.   Not tucked far back in a casino, but litterally steps from the Strip.   You order and then seat yourself, but you get real dishes and silverware (classy).  The food comes out fast, and tastes good (almost the best pizza that I have had from these gourmet pizza places popping up everywhere).  What's not to like?  Once word gets out, perhaps there will not be enough seating?"}
{"text":"I and my eldest sister are looking for this restaurant, and yeah, we have found it. We tried it for the first time at LAX, and we could not find one near Orange County. Hah-hah-hah... We have to grab a bite of our favorite pizza although we are so full after our dinner. Of course, the taste is pretty good. I like the fresh baked dough and its delicious topping. Unforgettable!"}
{"text":"A great spot to refuel while exploring the Strip. The location is convenient--and fun: right on the plaza in front of the Monte Carlo, looking out onto Las Vegas Blvd.

The indoor dining area is bright and airy, with lots of natural light. There are outdoor tables as well.

Our pizza was good and very reasonably priced for the Strip--$11.50 for a small one-topping pie. It was made to order yet still ready fast. We also tried one of the \"small bites\" meatballs, which was yummy and came with plenty of red sauce.

I was impressed by the friendly, attentive manager. He seemed truly interested in seeing that his customers had a good experience.

I also appreciated being able to pay, easily and quickly, with my MLife Express Comps."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this joint wanting a quick fix for lunch...and what a tasty surprise we had.  Pizza produced right in front of your eyes with fresh ingredients and fire baked in a stone oven.  Their crusts brought back memories of new york, while their sauce was definitely on-point.  And a beer on the side goes a long way.  They also offer fresh salad as well as some other specials.  Stop by when on the strip, pizza at 800 degrees is delish!"}
{"text":"Ate here twice during my stay at SLS.  The amount of food was a decent value, especially compared to the price for slices on the strip.  Pizzas were good and filling.  Workers were friendly.  Sitting area was a nice place to relax while still having the casino atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is the Worlds Best Pizza! Very authentic to Italy.  You must try:).  I was about to give the restaurant thumbs down.  The portions or toppings are small in size compared to other restaurants.   However, the night manager offered to redo the pizza.  I must share with you that it was exquisite.  Thumbs up!  During your stay in LV, be sure to include a stop to 800 Degrees Pizza Restaurant.    You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed their pizza and Caesar salad! Ordered the crispy thin crust. The whole thing was a thin pizza- not a lot of toppings or cheese. It was very flavorful! Went there twice in 5 days. Good prices for food. Drinks were pricey tho. Food was @$20..two beers and a soda were another 20.  Awesome service too!"}
{"text":"Its Las Vegas, so keep it in context. To me, this means that you'll likely be surrounded by folks there to party, not relax over a pleasant dinner. The food however, was wonderful. You can make whatever pizza you prefer, and the list of ingredients was outstanding. Salads were great, sides looked amazing, staff was friendly and helpful. If you're looking for a casual place for a pizza and beer/wine, maybe some people watching on the patio, then this is a very good option."}
{"text":"Overall this place is a good place to go if  your looking for some italian style pizza. Lots of drink options and a nice atmosphere to sit to enjoy your meal. I think 3 stars more so indicates that this is not my style of pizza, im more of a simple new york pizza kind of guy. Nothing was wrong with the pizza at all, all the ingredients looked fresh and tasted good. Would stop by again if im in Vegas."}
{"text":"Split a pizza and still had a slice left over.  We got a plain Margarita pizza for $10.  They have a military discount.  They also have a Coke machine with 100+ flavors.  But they offer free water which is perfect on a hot day."}
{"text":"Freshly made fire oven pizza.  All ingredients are fresh and in front of you to choose.  Quick to bake at such high temperatures too so wait time is minimal.  Only negative comment is the crust underneath can get soggy from the moisture of the toppings depending what you select."}
{"text":"I only came here to say - their Tartufo. Holy fuck. Best white pizza I've ever had. 

Comes out piping hot with the aroma of garlic and truffles. 

That's all that needs to be said."}
{"text":"Good pizza no talk about it. It became one of my favorite pizza places to go. You make your own pizza which is cool. Personal size pizza which is  more than enough for one person. Prices are a little high. Service is very good and workers are helpful. They have seats outside right on the Strip so you can enjoy the scenery."}
{"text":"So yummy, Im even craving it right now. I love the options for toppings. excellent"}
{"text":"Located inside the SLS hotel in Vegas, this place is their best on site restaurant option. Really, all of their restaurants are good, but 800 Degrees is one that I would say makes the stay at SLS much more enjoyable. I was staying there for almost a week and ate at 800D every-single-day! Their pizzas are perfectly crafted Naples style creations and their specialty pizzas were ALL fantastic to the last bite! They also serve wonderful salads and side dishes that are equally delicious. My favorite pizza was the Angry Bee, followed by the Zucca, the Margarita (w/ Calabrian chilis added), and the Pollo. Mmmm, I miss it!"}
{"text":"The pizza may cook fast, but don't be in a hurry. The first person asks what you want, then he gets snotty about what the ordering procedure is. The pizza was okay, nothing to leave you wanting more. I tried the gelato, after someone waited on me, I had to try to break into the pizza line to pay. I gave up and got back into the pizza line to pay. I could have just left, and no one would have noticed. Walk on by is my recommendation."}
{"text":"Not bad!  Pizza a little soggy and fell apart.  I did like the Greek salad.  I would try again sometime."}
{"text":"I love this place! The staff is super friendly and helpful. They have an assortment of fresh toppings and an assortment of different cheeses that you choose from to build your pizza. Then they cook it in a 800 degree oven in less than 60 seconds! They have a wonderful selection of gelato. I would eat here for breakfast lunch and dinner if I could. You absolutely can't go wrong with their pizza.  The general manager just came out and saw that I was trying to take a photo of the oven and offered to do it for me.  Really nice guy.   5 stars everytime I go."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 pizzas, burrata and beet salad and drinks.  Pizza's we good,  the burrata and beet salad took 10 minutes longer than pizza's it did not come with the balsamic or the warmed bread.  Another trip to request the missing parts of this order.  5 minutes later someone comes to our table with a half slice of dry toast on a plate.  Another trip to request the balsamic and bread, we were giving a small plastic cup with balsamic vinegar.... not reduced, not good quality.  A few minutes later another piece of bread was brought out, this was at least warm and had olive oil.  It became laughable by that time, I am certain that somewhere in Vegas they can pull this ultra complex dish off.... just not here."}
{"text":"Neapolitan pizza on the strip! The pizza is baked in a wood fired oven. The SAN Marzano tomatoes are fresh, sweet and flavorful. The dough is relatively soft but In the category of Neapolitan it is rather tough. The pizzas are constructed in a cafeteria line similar to Pie 5 or Project Pie, but the product is slightly superior. Definitely worth stopping, I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The pizza tasted delicious but the only bad thing was it was soggy in the middle.. They even had gluten free pizza crust. Which was awesome!"}
{"text":"My first and last time there. I definitely was expecting more. The employee was very nice and helpful. Also the place was clean and much larger than I thought. 
The reason for one star is just the pizza wasn't that great at all. They are super skimpy with the toppings. They do have a large variety of toppings and each coast $ 1.50 (but be ready to get just few pieces on the pie). The crust was tasteless and soggy in the middle. It even didn't hold my five half olive pieces. The sauce was not good either.  Overall, I found the pizza absolutely nasty and with no taste. The price seemed too high for what I got. The stuff gets point, but the quality of the product doesn't . I won't be checking this place out again."}
{"text":"Why so many haters? This place was awesome!

Cool concept! Fresh ingredients and tasted GREAT!

We got the tartufo pizza with chicken. Everything was done so perfectly. Came out hot and crispy (not soggy like others have mentioned)

Cheese was gooey and tasty. 

Chicken was moist 

I'm coming back! a few times !"}
{"text":"Fresh made pizza, only thing is the added topping extra $1.50 ea and if you add any meat the pizza get greasy and then it falls apart in the middle.. I found the staff helpful and never had an issue.. Compare to the other restaurants in the SLS casino this is reasonable to eat, one small could feed 2 people unless you are super big eater and/ or very hungry.."}
{"text":"The toppings on the pizza were good but the crust was super soggy which I disliked alot.. the meatballs were blah the sauce was too acidity in my opinion my son didnt even eat it... there a place by where I live (in Long Beach, California) called Pieology(so thats what im comparing it to).. that place is perfection every time thin and crispy.. tho whole pizza. Not just the crust... I dont think I would eat there again"}
{"text":"Quattro Formaggi w/ Pesto.

Good pizza.

But to me, what sets this pizza place apart from the others in Vegas is ONE THING... 
Their Calabrian Chili Oil!! 
Love those little chopped peppers you can drizzle all over your pizza.
It isn't very spicy, but it adds a nice little kick.

Great place for a late night snack.
But that chili oil is the main reason I would return. :)"}
{"text":"If I had to rate this place on only their food then it would have been 4/5 stars. I ordered 2 Greek salads and we customized a pizza. The food was excellent!!! My one problem was ordering. We ordered our pizza and salads but they forgot to charge us for our salads so we had to go back in line. Then they gave our pizza to the wrong customer; they also forgot the feta cheese on one of the salads and when they tried to remake our pizza they forgot 3 toppings. 

Maybe we just went on a bad day, but I doubt I'll  be going back."}
{"text":"Really cool pizza concept. I had never been to a place that could serve quality pizza in under 10 minutes because of the temperature the pizza is cooked with, so this place was a first! 

800 Degrees is conveniently located on the strip, within walking distance of Aria, Bellagio, and Monte Carlo. In fact, it is directly to the left of Monte Carlo. My friends  and I chose this place because of its near proximity and we were all starving. 

Unlike Project Pie, you can either choose a pre-made pie OR you can create your own pie and then pay for the additional toppings and what-not. The pie is New York style, so the crust will be extremely thin - be prepared for this! If you're not into thin crust... then this place may not be for you. However, the flavors are great."}
{"text":"I liked 800 Degrees. The staff were wonderful and helpful. One of the waiters noticed that the chair I was about to sit on had pizza sauce on it. He immediately got down on his knees and cleaned the sauce off my chair, I appreciated him doing that for me. The pizza cooks very quickly. I particularily liked looking out over their patio on the Las Vegas Boulevard S. They have a great selection of pizzas from the basics to the creative. Their cheesy bread is excellent. I wish they had a marinara dipping sauce for their cheesy bread."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the quattro formaggi and tartufo pizzas after watching the Blue Man Group. Both pizzas were made with delicious bianci sauce.This is a great option for vegetarians. Good quality. Casual and laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"I decided to try 800 degrees because I spotted the huge Nutella dessert poster posted on the wall. As delicious as it appeared is as delicious as it was! I ordered the Nutella calzone which comes with strawberries berries and of course NUTELLA. So delicious definetly not for one person or two or maybe even 3 unless u want to be border line diabetic but so worth it!"}
{"text":"Items Selected:
Burrata + Beets + Balsamic - Grilled Ciabatta
Meatballs - Wood-oven baked with tomato, oregano and Parmigiano Reggiano.
Quattro Formaggi with Sausage - fresh mozzarella, garlic, oregano, olive oil with Smoked Provolone, Parmigiano Reggiano, Gorgonzola, Fontina
Zucca - fresh mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, garlic, oregano, olive oil, butternut squash, caramelized onions, bacon, rosemary oil
Margherita DOC - Mozzarella di Bufala, Cherry Tomatoes, Basil

Located in the SLS, with a second local found outside The Monte Carlo at the other end of The Strip, it was largely an effect of travel and an ever expanding local 'to-do' list that had prevented me from visiting 800 Degrees until Saturday but armed with a $30 off $60 coupon provided by The Code for my birthday it was with a friend I sat down within the languishing casino, our 6:30 arrival seeing more than half the table games without a dealer and nearby restaurants Katsuya and Cleo less than 1/8 full.

Conceptualized by Adam Fleischman, the man behind Umami Burger and a growing empire of restaurants rolling out in the Golden State as well as parts East, the heart of 800 Degrees is the wood burning oven and capable of turning out a Neapolitan Pie in less than two minutes with any number of artisan toppings for under $15 it was only after careful deliberation that our selections were made, the $60 tab proving far tougher to target with just two diners than one would imagine but three pies and two sides achieving the goal with a glass of wine and iced tea to boot.

Exemplifying the 'quick casual' counterside ordering concept overtaking much of America's mid-range dining culture these days, but left to collect items from the cashier when a number is called out, it was perhaps an unfortunate aspect of the size of our order and a few parties following us that the pacing of our meal was marred by having to stand up from the table thrice to gather the goods, but once everything was finally obtained one would be hard pressed to find fault in the quality of any of the cuisine served - a first bite of creamy burrata and beets tinged in balsamic speaking of high quality sourcing soon to be found in each of the oven-singed plates.

Obviously focused on the pizzas, but happy to partake in charred balls of meat slightly smaller than a Titleist or Ping, suffice it to say that the four tender orbs were amongst the city's best for the price and with plenty of brightly acidic sauce left-over for dipping of crust it was onward to the Margherita DOC that our tasting progressed, each cherry tomato bursting with flavor beneath a bit of salt while milky mozzarella bubbled atop the smoky, pliable crust.

Said by some to be too 'wet,' but in reality a near-textbook rendition of the traditional Neapolitan pie, it was next in two 'Bianca' style discs that we sank our teeth and topping the Quattro Formaggi with a bit of crumbled sausage the smoke and savory composition sang, a similar bit of praise to be levied on the oft-praised 'Zucca' that matched tender butternut squash to briny bacon with caramelized onions and topnotes or rosemary tickling the palate in each and every bite.

No more expensive than Settebello, despite its Las Vegas Boulevard locale, and featuring far better ingredients than most 'artisan' pizzerias located throughout the 702 those looking for a top quality Neapolitan pie at a fair price would be well advised to check out 800 Degrees - one of those rare 'chains' doing things right, a rarity to say the least."}
{"text":"Great pizza at a good price. 

This was one of our most reasonably priced meals on the Strip. 

Located at the front of the Monte Carlo, it's hard to miss.  It's self service here; you place your order, pay and they cook. They have wine and beer available. Their website and menus go into detail about the type of pizza (neapolitan) they make.  It tends to be sauced and have a softer center.  We enjoyed the pizza here.  And the salad as well.  As mentioned, the prices are good for the strip strip.  Most likely because of the self service setup.  

We really enjoyed it here and will be back next time."}
{"text":"My fourth time here, and I must say the pizza is good. Not NY pizza, but good.  Yes, born and raised NYer, half Italian (my Mom) ha! ;)
The best is that everything ingredient is FRESH and extremely good ingredients. They don't carry fresh crushed red pepper, but they have an oil chili which has a wonderful kick! 
Now, the broccoli rabe AMAZING it's sautÃ©ed in the chili oil. By the way 800, White Castle and other places provide a local discount..."}
{"text":"The experience is not as described on the website.  Firstly, I ordered two margherita pizzas one with the Neapolitan crust and the other with the crispy \"cracker thin crust.\"  There is no cracker thin crust at this location, the young lady making my pizza informed me to simply tell the cook I wanted one pizza well done.  How is taking a traditional Neapolitan and cooking it longer going to make it thinner?  Secondly, I asked for one pizza to have extra basil and extra cheese (which I paid for).    When I picked up the pizzas one was not cooked longer nor was it \"cracker thin\" and it no longer had any basil.  When I told the clerk she asked the cooks if they had an extra cheese and extra basil pizza and right in front of me they were flippant, curt and unknowing.  I asked if the pizza was crispy and the cook replied, \"That's as done as I can make it.\" The clerk said she'd remake the pizza and deliver it to our table. When the new pizza arrived it did not have extra basil or extra cheese (which I paid for) nor was it cracker thin or crispy.  Additionally I had to eat before my wife. I suggest not offering the \"Crispy\" option on the menu at this location because they don't have it nor can they make it. The cooks are not well trained and have no finesse."}
{"text":"My family and I stayed at the Monte Carlo for the weekend and had $50 credit for each room to use on any of their selected Las Vegas Blvd restaurants. Since it was a Sunday, most of the restaurants and kitchens closed at 11pm and our only option was 800 Degrees. The employees are extremely friendly and patient with nine of us telling them what we wanted on our pizzas, which was great. If you've ever been to Pieology or Blaze, the concept of 800 Degrees is pretty much the same with the freedom of picking any and every topping. If you don't want to customize your pizza, you can opt for one of their specialty pizzas!

My family and I ordered a chicken and pesto pizza, a pepperoni pizza, and one of their specialty pizzas, which was sausage and peppers. Immediately I noticed that they don't have grated mozzarella and simply just distribute a ball of mozzarella on their pizza. Other than the cheese, they're not skimpy on the toppings! Our pizzas arrived less than 5 minutes after I placed the orders and each of us had 2-3 small slices. Honestly, for the price ($9-$15 a pizza) I would have rather saved the credit and use it the next day at a different establishment. The pizzas, except for the chicken and pesto, were bland and the crust was extremely thin. I also want to mention that there was some sort of bubble on the pizza on the specialty pizza and the employee remade it and checked on us to see if we were satisfied with our food. Great service!

If I didn't have the $50 credit from Monte Carlo, I probably wouldn't choose 800 Degrees. I am, however, impressed with the exceptional customer service practiced at this establishment!"}
{"text":"Fresh made pizza in 90 seconds is a dream come true!!!

I LOVE the concept of this place, pick your fresh made dough, sauce, & all the toppings your little heart could desire... Cooked fresh in 90 seconds!!!

Service is lacking but it is a \"fast food\" atmosphere. Prices are typical ridiculous Vegas prices for drinks & things, but the pizza itself was only $8 & some change."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Came here on a whim. I know this place is opening in pasadena, CA, and have been wanting to try it. Their toppings are great, as well as their variety of specialty pizzas."}
{"text":"It's just ok. 

I love that the ingredients are fresh, and that you can choose what goes on. However, BE SELECTIVE. The more ingredients you add, the heavier it is, and the more soggy the crust gets. But not only soggy in the center, but burnt on the crust. Seriously burnt where we peeled off pieces. We weren't the only ones with overcooked crust. However, the people that ordered only 3-ish toppings, their pizza crust was good. 

The chopped salad is good also!"}
{"text":"Overly expensive Blaze / Pizza Rev style pizza spot. Decent options...  it at $1.50 PER topping you are forced to eat one of their \"specialities pies\". So I usually eat vegan... but at $1.50 I was forced to eat a boring, not my type of pizza for $15. It's pizza. JUT pizza."}
{"text":"Super tasty pizza's!
We tried the Tartufo and the Sausage and Peppers, both were flavorful and delicious. Both had plenty of toppings. They worn us that the middle may seem wet because of the cheese but I didn't notice it being overly wet.
The staff was pleasant and helpful.
There's a gelato bar, ask for a sample before you leave!
Their pizza of the day is 50% off, makes it a great deal.
I wouldn't mind going back and trying some of their other pizza's."}
{"text":"I have been to quite a few 800Â° pizza establishments and unfortunately this one has to be ranked the lowest of all.
It was 25 minutes before the pizza even made it into the oven and it was only one person ahead of me. The make line was mortifying. The register staff just as bad. 
The pizza was burnt on the bottom and soggy in the middle. Someone (a great employee) saw me turning the pizza over and taking a picture so they made another one - unfortunately it was almost the same... undercooked on top overcooked on bottom... soggy in the middle with cheese turning into rubbery clumps as the pizza got past room temperature heading to cold. 

With all of these amazing ingredients at your fingertips and a wonderful Neapolitan concept... how could you go wrong?

The oven may need some temperature calibration?

How could they get this amazing pizza concept so wrong? 
Yes, but yet they do!

Fascinating."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of soggy pizza crust. That is what I got. I liked the taste of a fire cooked dough however, it can not be soggy. I had the Margherita with Italian sausage. They were out of pepperoni. The cheese, sauce, pesto, onions and sausage tasted good. The ingredients looked fresh behind the glass from what I saw. There was ample seating and the pics posted show a nice sized area to eat. Dishes to eat off are by the soda machine. I would try it once again, because I love pizza. If you follow them on Instagram you can get the pizza of the day for 50% currently."}
{"text":"A \"we can bake your custom created pizza in less than 60 seconds\" pizza place, 800 Degrees was an interesting restaurant to try. I came during lunch hours with a group of friends and each waited about 20 minutes before being able to create our own pizza. Once you enter the line, you have the opportunity to choose the pizza base and add toppings. Or you can choose one of their created pizza types. 

I decided to choose the classic Margherita pizza base and added pepperoni (each additional topping is $1.50). The employees were very professional and as advertised, the pizza was cooked very quickly, maybe too quickly. 

My pizza was soggy and oily as were many of the pizzas that my friends ordered. It was messy to eat. 

Three stars because of the neat concept and nice restaurant ambiance (there is no TV by the way), but I probably would not come here again."}
{"text":"This is the worst pizza place ever. 

I have eaten pizza in Africa that was better. The pizza was served raw in the middle and they tried to explain that this is the way it was supposed to be, RAW! We sent them back and the manager made knew ones; the wrong pizzas which were again served ; RAW.! 

And this is not cheap pizza; 6 pizzas and 4 beer/1 coke and it was $200.00

So RAW pizza with bad sauce; Raw Pizza/bad sauce and wrong toppings and it was left on the table uneaten. We did not get our money back because the manager says raw in the centre is how we make it.

WORST PIZZA EVER!"}
{"text":"Ordered a sausage and pepperoni pizza and it was tremendous. It wasn't all oily like I expected. Of course I was completely drunk when i ordered it and took it back to the room. I had just got out of Life nightclub, just in case you were wondering. It was $15 cocktail night at Life LOL I was almost broke from buying all those drinks at the club so it was nice to find some value at SLS at 800 degrees. I spent $11 for my pie and took it back to the room to my half naked lady friend. I had to eat before we got it in. Can't bone on an empty stomach or near half dead from binge drinking. Of course the pizza was her idea. she was faded and if she wants pizza before the act of committing adultery than cool. Right? LOL this really was the case. Anyhow, I was happy I ate the pizza naked with her and I will definitely be back with clothes on. Holla."}
{"text":"This is THE place for a quick and cheap meal in SLS. The Bianca white pizza was cooked perfectly without being soggy in the middle and if you aren't starving two can share a pizza. They cook these things fast (at I'm assuming 800 degrees) so you'll be back losing money in the casino here in no time. They also give you water cups so no need to pay for overpriced bottled water."}
{"text":"When I think of 800Â°, the name of this place, I believe,  after trying their pizza, stands for hell because that's how hot it must be in hell! The pizza here is just terrible! My friends and I were shocked at just how bad it is. We stayed at the Monte Carlo Hotel, currently under renovation, and this was the only place that was opened after 11 PM. We thought... Pizza?... It has to be easy. The line was impressively long, likely because this is the only restaurant open after 11 PM at this hotel. It is slow service so we waited in line quite a bit, which is likely why the line is so long. I ordered a margarita pizza and I also ordered a Filetti pizza ( pesto, tomatoes, and basil). There was an option to upgrade to a better quality mozzarella and we chose to do that. It was an up charge of six dollars per pizza.
The pizzas might as well have been 'dunked' in water. They were too watery with a watery and soft crust that was just disgusting. The cheese came right off the crust so you practically almost ate it separate from the crust/bread. The margarita pizza was OK except for the fact that it was too watery and soft. The other pizza was just disgusting, laden with garlic that was overkill in those tomatoes, but that is nowhere explained in the menu. 
So why one star only? Simple... Because of the exorbitant price for such poor quality. The total for these two pizzas that were small size pizzas with two diet Pepsi's was almost $50! Just no!
Next time, if we have to stay at this hotel, we will either order out or go elsewhere. We would never try this place again. Some of the worst pizza I have ever had. I would not waste my money here."}
{"text":"There was so much hype concerning this place when it first opened at SLS. It is also offered for in room service. Regardless, we ordered the margarita pizza which is always a classic and any true pizzeria that is part of the elite should be able to nail it. The margarita pizza here was grossly disappointing. There was absolutely nothing impressive about it and I would not have paid more than five dollars for the whole thing. This is not a pizzeria we plan on coming back to and are very disappointed by the poor quality of the pizza. It had some cheese and some tomato sauce and barely any basil. It had a thin crust but the crust was soggy. Extremely disappointing and would not recommend this to anyone. Getting one star because for the price of the pizza with the poor quality, just not worth it."}
{"text":"Decent prices and very quick! We order a crispy crust Tropicale, and a gluten free Zucca pizza. The gluten free crust was great, very thin which i like, however the crispy got a bit burnt. They actually had to re-make the crispy pizza because the first was totally burnt on the bottom, the second one was still a little burnt but whatever. They have a great variety of interesting toppings to choose from and the specialty pizza options are pretty good. The Tropicale pizza was amazing, the pineapple was fresh and not from a can, which I appreciated. The Zucca pizza had too much olive oil though, it was dripping all down my arm. Over all a good experience!"}
{"text":"Came with a group of friends and ordered so many different pizzas. We loved it! Love the fun, buzzy atmosphere and fun sayings on the wall. Highly recommended the spicy feta bread. Yum!"}
{"text":"My lady found this place while looking for places to eat while I was at a conference. We decided to check it out since pizza is one of my diet staples. 

We were greeted by some of the most customer focused, sincere, and menu knowledgeable restaurant staff I have ever encountered. 

The pizza, amazing. We ordered the margherita pizza and a Gorgonzola salad, two beers, and water. All this for about $30. In Vegas? What?! 

The staff was attentive while we ate, making sure all of our needs were met. 

What a perfect way to have our final dinner in Vegas. We will be back, and you all have to try this place. 

Whatever they do to train their staff, however they make their food, and the ingredients they use to make such delicious food is a trio of perfection. 

Well done! See you next time!"}
{"text":"Get the Tartufo pizza!!  It is sooo good!  It's truffle cheese, mushrooms, roasted garlic, and arugula.  A lot of people were ordering a pizza for each person in their party, but one pizza was more than enough for two of us girls.  (It's comparable to a personal size pizza at Grimaldi's, which is smaller than a small.)  The Caesar salad was good too and the small was enough for the both of us.  They've got gelato too but you can pass on the gelato.  What does it take to get some good dessert at SLS? :p

For those who have never been here before, the ordering system is like that of Subway.  You stand in line and place your pizza order, and as you walk down, before you pay at the register, you can place an order for salad/appetizers.  For those with a sweet tooth there is a separate counter/register where you can order gelato.  There is a drinks/condiments/silverware area, and you pick you seat, and leave your plates for the workers to bus.  Be prepared for the food line to move slowly and the pizza to take a little bit of time to cook.  While you're waiting, look up at the ceiling - you'll see some interesting scenes :)  

I wasn't planning on eating here, but the rainy weather prompted us to stay and eat at the hotel.  I'm glad we ended up at 800 Degrees - the food turned out to be delicious!"}
{"text":"We had an enjoyable dinner of pizza and salad on a Monday night. It took us at least 5 minutes to decide what we wanted because everything looked appetizing. But we made the right decision and were happy with our choices.

You can order one of their specialty pies or custom make your own by choosing your crust, base, and then toppings. They then assemble the pizza in front of you and fire it in the wood burning oven. We ordered the spicy meatball ($12.15): beef meatballs, ricotta, jalapenos, and calabrian chiles; and the gorgonzola salad ($8.00): buttered lettuce, candied walnuts, and dried cranberries. We love this kind of salad because of the nice balance of flavors. If you like spicy, the spicy meatball is for you. It had great combinations with calabrians forcing me to break a little sweat.

The service was very good as they run out the food to your table and they'll bring any plates or silverware that you need. They have plenty of toppings and I'll probably choose to build my pizza on the next visit."}
{"text":"The pizza was so good I got just the Margarita pizza it was light the crust was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside the cheese was good and stringy the sauce wasn't over powering perfect meal for 1 or 2 people or a great snack for 3 service was fast. The Margarita pizza is 9.95 as a base then I think it's 1.50 they had a bunch of toppings. They also had beer soda and Gelato.

When you get it to go they add chili oil and fresh parm the oil is good and just adds to the pizza."}
{"text":"The food isn't terrible, but the service is. I ordered the same basic margherita pizza as the girl in front of me. Her pizza was topped with a normal amount of toppings as it moved down the line with her server. Mine was topped with less than half the amount of topping by my server, right behind the other pizza. I finally said, hey, let's put a little product on the bread as I pointed to the nice looking pizza sitting right beside mine. The server looked confused and the server that was properly preparing the other pizza backed up and added the correct amount of toppings to mine. These little personal pizzas aren't cheap. Mine was 12 bucks and the proper amount of toppings is still skimpy. And the dude pouring my beer was pathetic. I was going to mention the 1/3 glass of head, but he'd already tried a half dozen times and I was hungry. I'm not cheap, I just don't like working harder at preparing my food than my server does."}
{"text":"Really on-point interior, fun ordering process, friendly employees and super delicious pizza. Would be a 4.5 if I could!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a pizza. Affordable, 2 pies are more than enough for 3 adults. Service is great and the pizzas are always served under 5 min of placing your order. In other words it's cheap, fast, easy and delicious."}
{"text":"Pull out that credit card and get ready. 

Was the pizza good? Yes. 
Would it have been better if I could rationalize spending $1.50 per topping, on a personal size pizza? Yes. 

You choose your base, which contains the sauce and cheese. I chose the Bianca which was olive oil sauce and mozzarella cheese. 

Then you get to choose your toppings! For 1.50 a piece. What?! I've been to a number of similar places back home (Chicago) and have never had to pay by the topping. I ended up with sausage and tomatoes. 

Don't get me wrong, it was actually a pretty good pizza. I was just ticked it ended up costing so much for two people when we were hoping for a more low-cost dinner. But hey, it's Vegas, I guess."}
{"text":"We were hungry. On the south end of Las Vegas Blvd. And in the mood for pizza. Cue 800 Degrees, a spot I've seen many a time but haven't been curious enough to step into until recently. 

I didn't realize it was a build-your-own-pizza kind of place before studying the outdoor menu. Though that novelty has passed for me, I'm still up for it every now and then. 

The pizza was all right. The service was where the visit went south. With the exception of the dough master who greeted us at the beginning, the staff was pretty much inattentive and inefficient. One practically fell asleep while putting toppings on (literally snoozing in between ingredients), one grouped our order in with another customer's and lost sight of it before we got to the register, and when it came time to finally pay, one failed to swipe my M Life card after I placed it in their hands. Give these people some proper coffee breaks!

Premium pricing. We got the Margherita with Pepperoni, which turned out to be about double the price of your average BYO pizza joint. I suppose it's the \"Strip value.\" Prime location, big indoor and outdoor dining areas. But lousy experience. Can't say I would return."}
{"text":"So this is not pizza hut or dominos. I'm throwing that out there for those people who aren't familiar with 'gourmet' pizza. I wouldn't want anyone to be disappointed. This restaurant is inside of my hotel (please go read my review of the SLS Las Vegas) and we ordered this pizza via room service. It was a little on the pricey side, but we didn't feel like going far that night. I found that my crust was a little on the charred side. We got the basic Neapolitan. My only complaint is that it didn't have enough cheese on it for my liking."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!  We ordered the Quattro formaggi (4 cheese) pizza and a large Greek salad.

The pizza was super cheesy and good!  The crust was a little soft towards the center though... (Wish it was a bit crispier). It was enough for 2-3 people to share if you order a salad too.

The Greek salad was pretty big and had a lot of nice vegetables and toppings.  

They had lots of drink options - beer on tap, wine, and coca cola make your own flavor soda machines. 

Price was very reasonable, especially for Vegas.

The seating area is quite large, and they have indoor and outdoor seating.  Definitely a good place for groups to come.

The only tricky part was finding the place!  There isn't a door from inside the casino.  Lots of signs for 800 degrees but it doesn't say \"outside!\".  Once you exit the casino to the street you will see it though!"}
{"text":"Looking forward to some Neapolitan crust style pizza. Fresh made dough, quality ingredients. Could of cooked it a bit longer though, the center crust sogged up too quick. By the last slice it was a soggy mess. Had it been cooked a little better I'm sure it would of been awesome. 

Oh and add more beers."}
{"text":"800 Degrees gets bonus points for being a very reasonably priced place surrounded by nearly universal price gougers. Nearly went 5 stars because of this.The center Strip area is generally comparable to Manhattan when it comes to prices, but it's actually cheaper than comparable pizza places in my hometown of Atlanta (which is not an expensive city). 
Service was excellent. Don't be afraid of the lines - they move folks through quickly (this is a \"make your pizza as you go\" type place). 
Tried 3 of pizzas:  
1. Spicy Meatball - absolutely outstanding. Great flavors - beware that it truly is spicy. Too spicy for 2 of the 4 members of our group. 
2. Carni, add Smoked Provolone - this one needed another 15-20 seconds in the oven (crust was very soggy) but the flavors were excellent. Thoroughly enjoyed it even with the soggy crust.
3. Zucca - if butternut squash on a pizza sounds good to you, give it a shot, but it's not really my thing. I'd probably never go for butternut squash on a pizza, and the rosemary was particularly over-powering here. Not a bad pie, but didn't work for me, although the crust was perfect on this one. 

Salads looked excellent, but I didn't try one. Service was extremely friendly. Probably would have gone multiple times if we'd tried it earlier in our trip."}
{"text":"Pretty good customer service however the pizza almost seemed to fall apart once I picked it up... However it did taste really good! The crust was perfect and it was prepared very well and fast! Over all not a bad place to eat."}
{"text":"Was not expecting much since it was located in the casino but this was one of the best pizzas I have had in awhile. The pizza had a lot of taste and worth trying if you are near."}
{"text":"Pretty okay pizza, surprisingly. We got the mushroom one and the margherite. Both were good. Service was very nice."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this restaurant. I was extremely disappointed!! The pizza was soggy from the middle, the pizza was burnt from the bottom. Every bite tasted burnt. I ate at the SLS location. The employees working tonight weren't very friendly either. I wouldn't come back. The most expensive bad tasting pizza I've had! $34 for 2 basic pepperoni pizzas with mozzarella and 2 drinks."}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing! I work across the street at showcase and I've seen this place but never tried it. I'm vegan so it's hard to find food on the strip and I was craving pizza for lunch. Only have a 30 min lunch at work so I was excited that the pizza is done in 90 seconds. The best vegan pizza ever. Catherine helped me out she looked like the head chef or a manager.she knew her menu items and ingredients. I did an order to pick up. Took me less than a minute to have my pizza. I will be back thanks Catherine. See you next time."}
{"text":"Great flavor on the ham and pineapple pizza, but the crust was barely crust at all. Most of the pizza resembled soup. A very soft, wet dough. The edges were crispy, but nothing else. Next time I'll ask for well done..?"}
{"text":"Very good pizza. They have a price that starts around $7 and toppings are $1.50 or more each. We walked in and was out in 4 minutes it was very fast."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience.  This cafeteria style pizzeria has you walk through a line.  No one seemed to know what they were doing and several times the person on the other side of the counter referred me to someone down the way.  You order your pizza at the first stop, sides etc at the next and then you get rung up.  They don't have a large selection of toppings and they don't seem to use premium ingredients.  Further, the antipasta salad was mostly lettuce and you couldn't even taste any flavor to the little bit of meat which was there.  The pizza had a burnt taste to it, more so than expected."}
{"text":"The value and quality are good at 800 Degrees.  It's not fancy, but you get a well made meal with good ingredients in a hurry, and at a good price.

I am picky about pizza, and for how much pizza these folks crank out, they do a very respectable job.  The Neapolitan crust is well made.  All of the toppings are great and there is a huge assortment to choose from.  The wood oven and the pizza chefs turn out well cooked pizzas.

The ambiance of the place is a little strange, cafeteria-like.  Not the cleanest dining area I have experiences.  But ok, I get it.

I would recommend getting a few more good beers in there.  I really could have used a Victory Prima Pils with my pizza."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the pizza here. They make it right in front of you with your ingredients of choice. They  cook the pizza in just a few minutes. The pizza has a nice crust that isn't too doughy. I had a traditional pizza with bacon and olives."}
{"text":"This was totally a last minute decision and I'm glad we made it! The SLS Hotel was walking distance from the Westgate, which we were staying at. Perfect 5 to 10 min walk. Pretty much like a Blaze Pizza or Pieology but this place came off a little more high end. You get to see the dough process turning from ball to crust and adding all the toppings thereafter. We ordered the Carni which had bacon, pepperoni, and ham. Best choice ever! All the meat toppings were spectacular! With your check in you also get a sample of their gelato. The service wasn't as great as the pizza,unfortunately, but if you're in the area and don't wanna go far for some good pizza Id say give em a try!"}
{"text":"I stayed at the SLS for four nights, and I can't get enough of this place! The ingredients are fresh and the service is outstanding and very accommodating. All three bases are very refreshing and tasty, and the truffle cheese bread was definitely worth the price. And you gotta get their gelato for a bit of dessert. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"This pizza was aweful. VERY BASIC! No flavor at all. If you like flavorless pizza this is the place! Came here because of a buzz feed review"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly, helpful and polite. We Loved the Nutella calzone! But then again who wouldn't love this delicious creation with Nutella and fresh berries wrapped in a perfectly baked crust!?! This canzone is enough to feel 2 adults as a full meal (also comes with ice cream).

My boyfriend loves the pizza and comes back every time he's in town. He loves the very thin crust and the truffle cheese option. I however did not like the crust ( I am a carb-aholic ) and really didn't like that we had to lift the pizza and place about 10 napkins under it to keep from having pizza soup. The truffle cheese is a fancy option, but I didn't really taste truffle amongst the other ingredients. 

I think this place is fine as a fast meal for people or families that aren't very health conscious. But if you are looking for a place to relax for longer than it takes to eat your food or for something that doesn't make you double think you're bathing suit options, this is not your place."}
{"text":"I love 800 degrees! 
This is real pizza. Neoplitana. Only the freshest ingredients are used.
Lmao people need to know how to eat and appreciate this pizza the right way. 
The crust is awesome and towards the middle a little chew makes for a good texture contrast.

My favs 
Margherita.
Vongole.
Piccante. 
As is no extra toppings maybeeee some prosciutto."}
{"text":"I stopped here on my way to the airport yesterday and chose the Zucca pizza. It was delicious with butternut squash, bacon, and onions. It cooks real fast and reasonably priced for the strip. Only reason they don't get 5 stars is for the service. They were nice but the guy rolling the dough wasn't getting my sense of urgency. He would make a whole in the dough and try again after I insisted I didn't care and if its not even round it's ok just got to go. Kept trying to perfect it. Finally told him to just leave it and put the toppings on please. Lol the employees were also yelling across the restaurant to each other just to say what's up or make a joke. Guess it's not a formal place so it's ok but I just wanted my pizza and to leave :) other than that great pizza and location."}
{"text":"This place was interesting. The pizza was great, but I had to specifically ask to have cheese on my pizza. Well... ok. 

The crust was decent, the cheese was tasty, toppings seemed really fresh. And? It was cooked SO FREAKING FAST. It's kind of like a Chipotle style place, but for pizza. You get in line, pick your base, pick your toppings, and then they pop the pizza in a super hot oven to cook. They do have a gluten free option, which is cool if you're doing that. They also have speciality pizzas that you can choose from. 

The service was really great. The lady talked us through our ordering (and did mention that there wasn't any cheese on the pizza I selected, though apparently not loud enough for my boyfriend to hear). 

Price was really good for Vegas. Two of us ate for around $25 including soft drinks."}
{"text":"This place is great for fresh pizza without a long wait.  Super convenient if you're staying at the SLS hotel/casino or just sightseeing.  One of my favorite pizzas and go to selection is the Carni which includes pepperoni, bacon and ham.  Includes fresh mozzarella cheese and basil I believe which adds to the flavor.  The portions are decent but I have been able to finish an entire pizza myself because of the thin nature of the pizza.  The salads are made fresh as well as the pizzas which makes me coming back to this spot over and over.  Open late till 2 am I believe makes it a great late night spot to dine with friends or solo for a quick bite. The option to create your own pizza is a plus but their selection of pizzas all sound amazing.  Make sure to try the different combinations of pizzas, definitely a place to check out at the SLS!"}
{"text":"Great pizza at a great price. 800 degrees was one of only a couple truly spontaneous dining experiences my wife and I had during our visit to Vegas. Our pizzas were very cheap when compared to pretty much everything we ate on the strip. It was great pizza with a thin crust, very fresh sauce and toppings, and a fair bit of char on the crust."}
{"text":"I ordered the sausage & peppers pizza and then added shrimp and goat cheese. The pizza was delicious at 1 o' clock in the morning. However, hubby created his own thin crust pizza and he was not impressed. Hopefully, they will bring one on the east coast as I enjoyed my selection."}
{"text":"Just came back and Sean was so great! He was so nice and genuine. I would come back just for him to help me again! Thank you, Sean :)"}
{"text":"Good place for a late night dinner. I like their pizza - tasty, original and affordable price. If you are looking something for quick dinner at night, you should choose this place."}
{"text":"My buddy and I stopped here for a small pizza to share at 2 am after a long night of drinking. It was a perfect amount of food before heading back to the hotel. 

The was prepared perfectly and in just a matter of minutes too!!! It was delicious and the crust had good flavor as well. I would go back there again."}
{"text":"It was neat to see them make the pizza in front of you as well as place it in the wood burning oven. Only takes a few minutes to cook. The size is comparable to other pizza places small size. $9-$11 for the base (sauce/no sauce and cheese) then you add $1.50 for each topping."}
{"text":"First timer this weekend and I have to say. I really enjoyed it. Even better my husband who is a pizza snob.. LOVED IT. We started with the marguerite and added yummy toppings, kids just added extra cheese and it was great. Service is GREAT. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. A guy even put 2 tables together for me so we could sit outside. I ordered the brocolini and just a heads up it is SPICEY!!! Not for me, but if you like spicey its really good...We will definitely return. We always stay at Monte Carlo and Im so happy they have added this to their choices."}
{"text":"Staying at SLS we had only a couple of restaurant, and having this place open so late is the best thing!! I had their pizza twice during my 3 day stay. First time I had the margarita pizza with pepperoni and mushroom. The second time I had the verde (pesto) with gorgonzola cheese and chicken. They were both amazing but I kinda liked the pesto one a little more. 

The concept is very unique. You go down the line and chose your \"base\" which is the sauce. Then you can choose from their specialty menus which has toppings pre-selected of you can just pick your own. The open up a ball of dough right in front of you, and they dont use pre-shredded mozzarella. They use fresh mozzarella balls and tear it up and put it on the pizza right then and there. It takes some time to bake of course but its really good pizza and hits the spot!!! You can easlly get a pizza for less than 10 bucks. Its a personal pizza and i polished mine off in one sitting but for the light eater, 2 people can easily share 1 pizza.

Very good!"}
{"text":"800 Degrees is a popular pizza shop along the Vegas strip just outside the Monte Carlo hotel.  I recommend arriving off peak hours (so it's not that busy).

I ordered the Margarita pizza with pepperoni, and sausages.  The pizza was picked up at the pick up window smelling delicious. (The food was delicious as well)

We didn't have a bad experience. Our friends complained that their salads lacked dressing.  If you sit outside you'll enjoy two different genres of music of neighboring bars."}
{"text":"Was driving around the strip and happened to spot this place and decided we need to stop by and check this place out.

Let's just say this place was packing, the atmosphere was different but nice. I liked how you can either sit inside or outside.

There's a variety of choices of pizza to choose from, only downside to it that it's very thin and it can serve 2 people with about 3 slices each.

The wait time is about less than 2 mins and comes out pretty hot, taste wise is alright but not the best. For the price I paid, I might as well get me 2 boxes of dominos and call it a night."}
{"text":"Hammer Konzept, nette Bedienung, kein Plastikgeschirr. 
immer, immer wieder!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We were at SLS one night and decided instead of going to the Cafe to try something different.
This was the first time we have ever heard of or tried this pizza place out.
It is amazing! We loved it!
When you walk in most the time there is a line but it goes pretty fast!
You tell the guy what kind of dough you want and then the toppings.... move a long the way and once you have ordered everything they will charge you, almost by the time your done paying the pizza is almost done!
I am serious we no sooner paid and got our drink went to find a table they were calling our number!
The flavors depend on what you want to put on the pizza. I did the fresh Mozzarella and fresh mushrooms and I think he had Fresh Mozzerella, pineapple and jalapenos on his.
They were both very flavorful and cooked just right,
I know he keeps asking when we will go there again cause he is craving their pizza.
I have to say I am not big on pizza and this one was VERY good. I mean it really was so fresh tasting.
I would say we will for sure go back! No doubt!! 
And there is plenty of pizza I usually bring home 2 pieces he eats all of his,, Nice size you order one per person unless you order other stuff you can share.

If your at SLS make this one of your stops! You will really enjoy it too! Plus everything was nice and clean!"}
{"text":"The employees at 800 Degrees Neapolitan Pizzeria in Vegas were quite friendly. I forgot to pick up my greens salad because I was preoccupied with my pizza. An employee chased me down the casino to give it to me. There was something comforting coming to a pizzeria that I am familiar with in the LA vicinity.

The concept is simple. It is a thin pizza served with any type of topping you desire. They have several different types of pizzas to choose from if you are indecisive, but I prefer to choose my own base and toppings such as spinach, mushrooms, peppadews, etc. It is a great place to visit at least once if you are staying at the SLS. Honestly, if I really tried, I could have eaten the whole entire pizza, but half of my pizza was plenty to tame my hunger. I'd recommend the burrata dishes. It is so delicious! Stay away from the greens salad as I was overwhelmed by the lemon dressing."}
{"text":"Before you dine make sure you understand exactly what \"Neapolitan\" pizza is & make sure you like it. Neapolitan style pizza is also referred to as \"wet\" pizza it's truly authentic to Italian style pizza and is not what Americans are used to. 

The pizza will need to be folded or the toppings will slide off . For being on the LV strip the price is honestly rather cheap . Being a local I understand strip pricing is typically hiked up 20-25% for you fabulous tourists ....

I'm ok with the pie here, my complaint is the salad. I ordered the Pear Gorgonzola salad & the dressing was so intense! It's like somebody dumped a straight bottle of vinegar on my salad. My friend could smell the vinegar from across the table . Stay away this salad dressing literally singed my taste buds it was so intense. 

- The Ambiance is great! 
- The pizza is good IF you like Neapolitan style. 
- Price is affordable for being on the strip. 
-Caesar salad is yummy
- Gorgonzola salad is not recommended 
-  * Cheese lovers order the Burrata with pesto is delish!

Overall I definitely recommend!!! :)"}
{"text":"Went there on 08/10/2017 around 8:00pm. There a few people in line, but the staff was taking their sweet time making the pies.  I guess their conversation was more important than customer service. After about 5 minutes of watching the sloths at work I walked away."}
{"text":"The pizza I didn't think was very tasty. I ordered a Margherita pizza, it was heavy on sauce and not particularly good sauce at that and light on cheese. However, the hours of operation are convenient, it is clean, the staff was friendly, and the pizza was served quickly."}
{"text":"This place absolutely rocks, I really like to come here and order a fully loaded Margherita pizza

extra red sauce, extra fresh mozzarella, grilled onions, prosciutto, spinach, and then when they put it in the oven I asked him to make it a little longer so the blisters grow and our little extra dark this makes the pie so crispy and delicious.

 The staff here is amazing they are very well trained the food comes out extremely fast you will not be disappointed by the quality of this amazing artisan pizza...


Pro Tip: Try the Meatballs with caramelized onions,, they are mind blowing."}
{"text":"This place was cool, I just had higher hopes and expected it to be better than it was. We decided to eat here during a stay-cation  for my birthday at SLS Hotel and Casino.

We decided on the sausage & peppers pizza, Italian sausage, peppadews, carmelized onions. $12.15

My friend had eaten here previously and mentioned the only thing is that the pizza is often soft and not as cooked towards the center.

My friend was correct, the pizza was much more crispy towards the crust and a bit limp and soggy in the center. The pizza was good however, I feel they skimped out on the sauce, cheese and toppings. I am sure you can asked for extra or double for an extra charge but why should I have to?

I tasted mostly sauce and dough in most bites, the cheese was skimpy.

Anyhow, it was cool, I tried it and may visit on a 50% off locals Sunday night. I also enjoy that the SLS has one selected restaurant each Sunday that is 50% off for local diners.

I did enjoy how you can see your pizza pie being made fresh in front of you."}
{"text":"The pizza was \"ok\"- it was nice to have a gluten-free option. Toppings are 1.50 each so it is a little pricier. The best thing about this place was the staff. Very friendly and willing to make your experience a pleasant one!"}
{"text":"Pizza was ok but the confusion with the staff was horrible. Pizzas we're going into the over in the wrong order and coming out. The topping each cost an average of 1.50 so your 10 dollar pizza could easily end up a 20 dollar pizza. But this is the strip and prices are usually like this, I expected more from an establishment that's been open for some time."}
{"text":"CHOSE YOUR OWN TOPPINGS!! Quick and convenient.  800 is located in front of Monte Carlo. This place is new with friendly staff and easy going ambiance. Definitely  need to eat with a fork and knife because of the soggy thin crust but it's tasty and I was starving. Haha but a nice quick bite if that's what you are looking for. Good luck and good eats!"}
{"text":"YET ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL BAEGAAAAS TRIP!

staying inside the SLS, the newest hotel along the strip. One of my biggest problems whenever hitting sin city isn't the gambling, partying, or accommodations but always the FOOOOOD!!

there's only Mcdonalds, chipotle, Panda Express, or earls sandwiches for those easy meals!

NOT ANYMORE!!

Over the course of our four day stay I had seven pizzas from this place.

Usually the margherita pizza. A bit soggy due to the runny sauce, the fresh mozzarella cheese and basil picked it up enough to hit the spot.

Unfortunately during their longer lines around 4AM-ish they tended to burn the bottoms of my pizza a few times /:

For $8 a pop what do you expect?!

The Capriccosa was a meat-lovers dream *insert heart eyes emoji*

Delicious. Best way to end those late nights with some italian pies and some comfy SLS sheets. 

DISCLAIMER, after party in ROOMS 27015 and 27018!! Everyone is invited!"}
{"text":"This place is the best! From Westwood to Vegas. Best value around. And the pie of the day is my favorite thing to try so I can get adventurous for 50% off!! Definitely the best place to get thin pizza, nice salads & tasty sides. My favorite"}
{"text":"Very cool experience.  Classy establishment.  Quality ingredients.  Mouth Watering.
Those should pretty much wrap together the experience here.  I think everyone should try a couple of these fast-fire pizzas places at some point.  It's a very fast-food-esque way to enjoy an amazing class of food.

My thoughts on this place... For starters, it's pricey! Each add-on ingredient is pretty expensive, which really limits the kind of pizza I would have liked to build.  The pizza is pretty much meant to be enjoyed right away.  It is a thin-crust pizza with not a lot of weight to it, so it doesn't stay hot for long and will get soggy quickly if you don't eat it.  One of the downsides to a 800-deg oven is that some (not a lot) of the crust will get burned.  I really don't care much for eating blackened crust pieces, and I'm too lazy to pick them all off.  

Very cool to try once.  Now that I've been to this chain here and in LA a couple times... I'm over it.  I've had better fast-fire pizzas places that also maintain very high quality ingredients for a better overall pizza at a lower overall price."}
{"text":"FÃ¼r den schnellen Hunger ideal! Die Pizzen werden frisch gemacht und kÃ¶nnen individuell belegt werden... DÃ¼nner Boden, gute Zutaten - schmecken herrlich!!!
Preislich sehr moderat! Freundlich!
Wir waren im SLS-Hotel - 800 degrees gibts Ã¶fter in Vegas..."}
{"text":"800 Degrees has a very special place in my heart because I frequented its other location in LA so often (probably 4-5 times a month I wish I was kidding) being that it was in my alma mater's neighborhood (UCLA/Westwood - GO BRUINS). This is comfort food. It brings back college nostalgia. Also it's really high quality pizza. It's almost like a fast food joint, but it's too fancy to be one? 

800 Degrees is not like the other make-your-own customizable pizza places like Blaze or Mod or Pieology, because I think the toppings and bases are a lot more gourmet. I don't think this place is comparable because the quality is higher!

I always get the margherita base, so I did the same for this location. On top, I added butternut squash, mushrooms (there are literally 5 types of mushrooms in their blend like are you kidding me), pine nuts, soppressata, broccolini, corn, and arugula. Yes - my pizza is aggressive, but it's so good. After you customize your pizza, it is wood fired for a short time and your food is ready. 

**Note: You can have your pizza cooked a little longer to make it crispy because the toppings tend to slide off pretty easily since the pie is very thin. I always eat my pizza with a fork and knife to get all the toppings in one bite. 

Other bases are marinara, verde (pine nut pesto), and bianca (white with no sauce). There are a ton of meats to put on top of your pizza, and the cheese selection is also great - I have added fontina on top of my pizza before. 

Also, I can eat an entire pizza by myself in one sitting, but I am pretty stuffed by the end and thinking of names for my food baby, so be warned that you will be very full.

The only reason I'm giving this location 4 stars instead of 5 like the LA locations is because Vegas is a little more expensive. Makes sense given the tourist location, but still sad."}
{"text":"Time for my review of this place as I feel it deserves my review since becoming a regular here. My first time here I was hungry for just a slice or two of pizza and ordered the margarita pizza thinking the menu price was per slice. To much of my pleasant surprise it was for a whole individual personal pie!! I love how you get to choose a great array of top ingredients such as truffles. I'm a huge fan of truffles. Whenever I come here (average 3 times a week now) I always order the pizza with truffle oil truffle salt and truffle cheese. The aroma from the oil when added to the food just brings out the flavors. One choice i always get is their truffle cheese bread. A huge portion big enough to satisfy a foodie like me who loves leaving a restaurant full and happy. The staff here from the pizza makers to cashiers and managers have all been very friendly and accommodating especially once they've gotten to know me and see me come by many times. Plus one of the girl pizza makers is hot and cute . It was also very nice of Kenny (I believe he was a manager) to have bought me a pistachio gelato, thanks Kenny. This place is so good I encouraged all my local and visiting friends to come try out their food and the response from them were all positive all of them said they enjoyed it so much they came back for another 2 or more times. One friend of mine who I kept insisting they try their food kept hesitating so I bought her several pizzas and a truffle cheese bread for her and she is now a regular like me. That's how much I believe in their menu items that I was more than happy and willing to just pay for it all. Now on a separate note I was there last night and tried the side of meatballs with my main order and was a bit disappointed in that selection. Felt that it was not worth the $7 for a few tiny bites but no worries I just won't order it again the pros of their food makes me still come here regularly. To all the staff here reading this thank you for everything and keep up the great work. I want to see you guys stick around for years and years. And to the cute woman pizza maker ...... \"Hey there ..... \""}
{"text":"I ordered the margherita pizza with pineapples and bacon. It was disappointing! The lady who helped me was so stingy with the toppings. She only put 10 pineapples. It was really soggy. I really don't know why it's soggy. She barely put any cheese and sauce. It was so plain. Pieology is WAY better than this place."}
{"text":"Don't know what happened to this place. We went there yesterday afternoon and the place was filthy. There were only maybe five or six other customers there and there was not one clean table. There was a guy walking around with a bar towel spreading the filth around on each table. They were as dirty when he finished as before he started. Finally had to grab a bunch of napkins and clean our own spot as best we could. Silverware was dirty looking, covered with spots. And to top it off the pizza was not very good. 
I highly recommend you check for a clean table before placing your order. I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this place out and what a disappointment.  This place is similar to Pieology, you select crust, sauce and add toppings except while at Pieology it's a flat rate this place you better be ready to shell out some cash for anything other than cheese.  So while staring at the toppings it would have been nice if they were labeled.  I just picked out the obvious ones that I wanted because I didn't feel like sitting there for 10 minutes asking the guy \"whats that...and that...and how about that?\".  Maybe I just don't know my high society toppings but it would have been nice to know what everything was.

So after picking out everything our pizza's go down the assembly line and into the \"800 degree\" oven (gasp).  From there they bring out the pizza and cut it and call out people's number to come pick it up.  What a let down this pizza was.  Some parts of my cheese didn't get melted all the way.  Crust was soggy.  Everything was blah.  Considering that this was basically a $17 pie it was a total bomb.  If I was going to rank this among other pizza places I've tried it would be right below Little Caesars.  So save yourself the disappointment and go to Secret Pizza at the Cosmopolitan or even Five50 pizza at the Aria...if you're still bent on getting disappointment pizza go to CVS and get a microwaveable one.  At least it wouldn't be a total rip off."}
{"text":"So good! The best pizza I've had for as long as I can remember (not exaggerating)! Crust is perfect, not too thick or thin and full of flavor, sauce and toppings are fresh and delicious. I got a salad too, it was very filling and had top-quality lettuce and toppings, very delicious salad that I'd eat often if I could as it has the same fresh healthy toppings as the pizza. Perfect place if you're starving in vegas, worth every penny!

I hope they expand their locations!"}
{"text":"800 degrees of disappointment. Probably one of the worst build your own sports I've ever been too. They are light handed with everything down to the sauce. Add ons are 1.50 per topping and they still sit there and count out your pepperoni. Pizza was done quick but lacked in the taste department. For $15 + dollars your money can be better spent. Only thing good about this place was it's close proximity to the Strip and to MGM."}
{"text":"Great pizza and salads.  The pizza is thin crusted just the way I like it.  The greek salad is also tasty."}
{"text":"We came here thrice during our two-night stay in Vegas. Was it really that good? I've had marvelous pizzas before! But something about the choose-it-yourself, 10-minutes away from wood-fired to golden delicious pizza cheesy heaven...

No is just not an option. So thankful there's a location in Westwood!

The ingredients here are vast, fresh, and eclectic. They have anything from your basic mozzarella, feta, olives, marinara, and mushrooms to pesto, basil, jalapeÃ±os, red chili peppers, and asparagus. 

They even have killer salads. Basic Caesar is just done right here--has the perfect amount of lightly tossed Romano Caesar dressing brushed with freshly grated Parmesan. 

And they have just-for-you portions. As a small, slender girl, I was able to polish off my own pizza A-ok, no problemo."}
{"text":"Good concept however this location cannot execute properly.  First of all I ordered the \"cracker thin crust,\" at this location there is no such option although it's listed on the menu.  The novices making the pizza are just that, novices.  It seems this is their first foray into the food industry and they seem apathetic and overwhelmed.  There is no quality control and the dough is too soggy.  With better training, better staff and a tweaking of the assembly line this place could be good.  I think the overwhelmed, poorly trained staff cannot handle the volume.  Don't be fooled by the video on the website, that is not the experience or pizza you will have."}
{"text":"So being from LA we have the same version of make your own pizza .. aka pieology. Anyways going in i was impressed with the selections that you have to add to your pizza. What i wasn't impressed with is the $1.50 for every additional topping.Your $8 pizza can turn into 15 quick.... Anyways from being okay pizza the service sucks !!! So you must order at least 3 times with three different people before you can pay and hope by the third time they don't mess up your order which they did. I have never experienced someone go to your table and take your food from you to give you a smaller portion. All i have to say is i feel bad for the person that had to touch the salad after me. The worse part is the guy argued with me about what i ordered. Keep moving on people there are plenty of other restaurants that are over priced that you probably will enjoy."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Monte Carlo and we decided to try this place it's AMAZING! We had the Bianca pizza and added bacon and basil with a Caesar salad. It was fresh, flavorful and delicious! But it is 1.50 for added toppings a little pricey but it's delish."}
{"text":"The wife and I love wood fired pizza, but the staff manning the ovens do not seem to really know what they are doing.  The pizza was not in the over long enough, so it lacked some char, the cheese was still solid, and what char it did have was limited to one side, since no one ever turned it in the oven.  We were starving, and the pizza tasted ok, but nothing to write home about or want to eat again, or give a rave review about....."}
{"text":"Great fresh made pizza! I just returned from my fourth trip to Italy and haven't eaten pizza in the states since returning. 

Quick service - interactive - and yummy!! The have Birra Moretti which also makes me happy! 

Come you will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"This place is similar to Blaze and Pieology, if you have even been to those places. It's like subway for pizza. The prices are kind of ridiculous thought. it's $1.50 for every topping you want. Also they don't have as many topping options as Blaze and Pieology, but they do use fresh mozzarella cheese. The service is just normal. I would eat here again because I love pizza, buts it's not one of those places you absolutely have to try when you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"if you're a fan of thin crust, this is your place. The pizzas are pretty reasonably priced and you can definitely split one between two people with smaller appetites. Amazing crust and fresh toppings. 

I see that others have complained about the toppings sliding off. This is a good thing to me because this means that there are a lot of toppings on the pizza. True thin crust doesn't hold the toppings as well as say Dominos Pizza, so you have to fold the pizza over to keep it all in. 

Service was great and everyone was super friendly!

Will definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"The pizza dough is really good, it is a bit pricey for a pizza but it does come out fresh. I have been to other spots where it is cheaper and about the same in flavor. The crust is crispy and soft in the middle with the cheese and toppings. The service was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered the veggie pizza and cranberry salad, it was AMAAAZING! One of the best pizzas I've had in a long time!!!! Not to mention the employees were so friendly, happy and helpful!"}
{"text":"The pizza was just ok. If you build your own they charge you $1.50/topping. I chose a margherita base, but the mozzarella they use is in chunks rather than shredded so the cheese is not evenly  distributed. 

They have good ice creams! 

I gave them an extra star 3 for the employees because they are all so nice and accommodating. Shout out to Thomas for making our pizzas!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype of this place is. 

This is the subway of pizza.  You pick a crust, I chose the thin which had no taste.  

Then you pick a sauce.  Not sure why the call crushed tomato sauce that when it's a liquified catsup. 

They put a hint of cheese and the toppings.  They treat the topping as if they are going broke. Scarcely putting any toppings on this tasteless, bland \"pizza\".  

And for $15.....this is one place I'll never visit again. 

And to compliment this tasteless product the 9 people behind the counter act like they are working on a chain gang. No smiling or interactions with customers or each other.  They all look pissed off for being there. 

And a bad attitude pairs will with lousy food."}
{"text":"Best pizza on the strip.  Great prices and wine and beer choices.  The ingredients are so fresh and there is a huge variety of topping options.  The carni is a must for meat lovers and loved the zucca!"}
{"text":"Huge portion, delish made to order pizza. Perfect crust and salad was fresh. The romain was a bit wilted in the heat, but not their fault, it a billion degrees in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The pizzas are quite big.  My husband and I split a large salad and pizza and we left really full. Not even room for dessert. Fresh food mated to order. Delicious!
The front of the restaurant is open to the street and it was quite hot in parts of the restaurant. If you sit near the back,  near the spot where the air condition meets the heat, it's ideal"}
