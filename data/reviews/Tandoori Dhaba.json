{"text":"I had chicken biryani lunch special. It was $5 lunch special which came with a yogurt side to add to the rice. Very flavourful and a very large portion. The chicken cuts in the rice was large. The yogurt that came with it I did not personally like it. I found the rice spicy and had a great kick to it! I feel they should offer one of the sauces with the rice as it was dry and my preference would have been for something alternate to the yogurt that came with it! They do have a lunch special; it is a tray with five slots to put from their hot food counter. I will go back and try this option as I found the rice filling yet too much for just being rice. They also have 3 samosa for $1. I tried to order but she said they were sold out. Overall an ok experience, the staff was very friendly and it is very hot in the restaurant. There are a few stools and two tables to sit at but this is more of a takeout venue than sit in and dine. Next time, I'll try the lunch option from the hot counter."}
{"text":"This restaurant is primarily a take out place. There is one table where you could possibly eat at. Food is ordered in cafeteria style where there are a few dishes on steamer trays behind a glass screen.  I ordered a non veg thali for $7 ($8 including tax) which included 2 meat dishes, 1 veg dish, 1 dessert, 2 pieces of nan made to order, rice, salad and yogurt. The price is pretty good compared to other places charging $9-$10 plus tax. There were 3 choices of meat dishes (goat curry, butter chicken and tandoori chicken with green peppers). The vegetarian selection had more variety; 6-7 dishes (dal makhani, aloo gobi, channa masala, saag paneer, shahi paneer, etc). The visible dishes did not seem to reflect the entire menu. I wonder what would happen if someone ordered something not displayed.  I just chose from what was available. I wasnt too sure on what to get. The lady explained what the dishes were. I got goat curry, butter chicken, channa masala (chickpeas) and gulab jamun for dessert (sugar soaked bread). I got the meal to go and it came in a plastic container with segented sections. The lid was secure and did a good job to keep each section separated. Unfortunately the food was really hot and the containers were difficult to hold because of that. The entire meal was very filling. And took me about an hour to finish. The rice was on the dry side but fine with sauce. Each meat dish had a few chunks of meat. I thought the butter chicken was really good. I have found most times i have ordered butter chicken from other places, it had a very strong tomato flavor. This one was more creamy which i liked. I was able to finish up the sauces with the rice and nan. The only thing i did not eat a lot of was the yogurt. The gulab jamun was really sweet and moist which is i think was typical of that dessert."}
{"text":"This was a random skip the dishes order and I was so happy that we tried it. We ordered one chicken briyani, one butter chicken and 10 samosas. It was not too spicy, with the right amount of kick. The samosas were exceptional and the spicy yet sweet red sauce that accompanied it added to the overall flavor. This will be a repeat order, as food is of exceptional quality for a very reasonable price. The chicken briyani is a huge serving for $7, with boneless chicken. The butter chicken was $10, and was enough for 4 meals. The samosas were really the biggest hit, they were 2 for $1 and quite good."}
