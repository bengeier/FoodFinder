{"text":"TP's is no joke about the amount of food they serve!!! Now don't get me wrong I can put it down, but I still went with the half Rueben. Can say the the flavor was delicious, but I have been to Carnegie Deli... and although it was good it didn'tblow my mind."}
{"text":"This is the spot we hit before the Rattler's games. We've been here 3 times now. There are two Men that are always there. I'm assuming they are the owners or managers. They are always very friendly and making sure everyone has what they need. I've tried something different every time and it has always been good. The serving sizes are pretty large too. Great place!"}
{"text":"Outstanding pre-game meal before the Suns game!  Dad loved the Pastrami Reuben.  And we all enjoyed the complimentary game night bread pudding.  Don and Lenny took great care of us.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love that they are downtown, amazing eats and great service.  I stopped in before the game and grabbed a sandwich and drink loved both of them.  Would strongly recommend a stop in before game also beer was priced to move!!! $2.00 beers"}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a quick bite to eat before going to the Sun's game and we just happened to stumble across this AMAZING place!!  As we were standing outside deciding between Tommy Pastrami's and Fired Pie next door, a gentlemen walking past us told us their location, Tommy Pastrami, had just opened and the food was great and we should come in a try it.....so we figured, why not!!!  The location is a tad small, very clean and welcoming.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  You order at the counter and the menu is on the wall above the register.  As we were looking at the menu, one of the staff members explained the menu to us, a little bit of history of the company, and then added that their breads are homemade!!  Ummmm...YES PLEASE!!  The menu isn't too large either, making it easy to decide on your grub of choice....I like that! I ordered the 1/2 reuben with pastrami (you have a choice of pastrami or corned beef) and I made it into a combo with some potato salad (also HOMEMADE) and a bottle of water.  My husband had the \"halfer\" sandwich choosing pastrami as the his meat of choice and adding swiss and a bottle of water, just as we were making our order, I notice a refrigerated case off to the side containing waters, juices and.....CHEESECAKE (also HOMEMADE).  Well of course I just HAD to add a slice of cheesecake to the order.    Our bill was around $30.00, a little pricey, but well worth it!!  We grabbed our bottles of water and the cheesecake and grabbed a seat, our food was brought over to us.  My sandwich was amazing!! The pastrami just melted in my mouth, sooo good!  The swiss cheese was melted and stringy, the sauerkraut was crisp and the bread was fresh.  The whole sandwich was full of flavor and delicious.  The potato salad was honestly some of the best potato salad I have ever had! The meal also came with a pickle, which was tasty as well. My husband said his sandwich was also very good.  His was pastrami and swiss with some mustard (by the way, they keep large squeeze containers of mustard on the table).  Now for the grand finale......(drum roll please...) the cheesecake was absolutely SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALIDOCIOUS!!!!!! It was by far the best cheesecake that my husband and myself have EVER had, hands down!!!!!  It was so light and airy and still very rich.  It was the perfect ending to an amazing sandwich!  As a matter of fact, we asked how much it would be to buy a whole cheesecake and if that would even be possible!! One of the employees said he wasn't sure and shortly after, a gentlemen came up, handed us his business card and said we could contact him if we would like to order a whole cheesecake and he would be more than happy to accommodate us and get us the price info!  Well Mr. Len Combs, President, you will more than likely be hearing from us!!   If you are downtown, in the area, and looking for some good grub with a welcoming and friendly staff....I HIGHLY recommend stopping by Tommy Pastrami's and hooking yourself up with a tasty sandwich and a piece of divine cheesecake!!! I can tell you, we will be back FOR SURE!!!!!  WELL DONE TOMMY PASTRAMI'S!!!  :)"}
{"text":"If you're lookin' for an authentic gigantic fresh deli sandwich,  this is the place!!!    The pastrami sandwich is perfect from the 1st to the last bite.   Amazing meat, fresh baked Rye and deli mustard with a kick to bring it all together.   Not to mention the pickling spice blend on the pickle!!!  Good stuff.  Staff is just as good, professional, friendly and my lunch was ready within just a few minutes.   This place is a keeper,  I'd eat here everyday if I could.  8)"}
{"text":"New York Jewish food in the desert!  Dr. Browns, matzoh ball soup, knish!  Anytime we are downtown at the convention center this is the place to eat.  It's great."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwich. Original pastrami on home made rye. They are very proud of their food and place. The steak Fries and bread pudding is excellent and home made!"}
{"text":"Back one year later for the same convention, thought I'd give them a second chance.  Still after one year of attempting to serve lunch to convention goers, the owner chose not learn from past experience, check the calendars for the surrounding convention spaces to see what crowds crowds to expect, and staff his restaurant accordingly.  There is zero excuse for only one of the two cash registers being staffed when the line is going out the door.  One star off my original rating for a relatively bland pastrami, one star off for not learning from lessons of the past."}
{"text":"Best Reuben sandwich I've had. A little NY flavor in Arizona. Awesome staff and very good food!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I got the corned beef sandwich with a side salad. The meat was sliced so thinly and was very tender."}
{"text":"Excellent food and even better service, the manager was very friendly and even when it was busy he was able to make it around to each table and have a small conversation with the customers. If you are looking for a good place to go before an event at US airways arena or somewhere to grab lunch this is definately the place for you!"}
{"text":"This place is great the service is awesome. Worked for NBC in the Verizon Super Bowl Central compound and we catered our lunches and breakfast thru them several times. They were very helpful and always had our food ready to roll at the time we needed it. I recommend them for sure!"}
{"text":"5+ Great food and great service from start to finish. Great food good price nice atmosphere and they also sell beer soda root beer floats and much more."}
{"text":"Best cheesiest grilled cheese sandwich on rye bread ~ delicious!! This sandwich never disappoints!!  Sampled the bread pudding a la mode ~ yummy!  Friendly staff too!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Just finished half Rachel pastrami (cole slaw instead of sauerkraut) - fresh & hot with superb flavor! Add fries only if you're starving my friends. Perfect spot for lunch near convention center...easy walk on a glorious, sunny day."}
{"text":"As I was in line the cashier (who is nice) had issues with the register. She asked for help and was told by manager she couldn't cause she was on her cell. Another manager is always outside on his cell. I left as it didn't look like they would bother ringing me up on next register. Fries are good, the reason I go."}
{"text":"Really good food and really nice people...definitely a do over! They have real new York style food without the new Yorker attitude. My wife and i loved everything we ordered."}
{"text":"The kids meal food was just okay, and my salad was a bit wilted, but the Reuben was amazing! The fries were delicious, too, and the customer service was out of this world. This is absolutely one of the most family-FRIENDLY places around. From punching holes in lids to accommodate straws in kid-sized cups to not only providing free ice cream for all our kids (including the baby) but offering me said ice cream with unmatchable stealth and then personally applying the chocolate syrup tableside, I've never felt so appreciated dining with my kids."}
{"text":"Wonderful service!! The staff is super friendly and even gave us a free dessert! It was warm applecrisp served with vanilla icecream and tasted delicious. We are defintely coming back!"}
{"text":"excellent pastrami!    I tried going for dinner twice but the hours are pretty much business lunch only.  When i finally got down there they were only open later because of a ball game.  Limited hours aside, the food is top notch and they do catering which is great if you work downtown.  The pastrami is fresh and flavorful.  Pricing is moderate but not too bad.    The owner and his staff were super friendly and conversational."}
{"text":"Great food  and amazing service.  My pastrami on rye was perfect.  The meat was sliced just right and the bread is made 2 blocks away , you really can't beat it.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Good deli for AZ.  Not as good as I've had in other areas of the country, but best I've had in AZ!  I think the two owners were working as they were almost over the top in trying to take care of us customer service wise.  The intention was good, but too much IMHO.  I'll go again."}
{"text":"Amazing food. The pastrami sandwich was the best I've ever had and huge. Never had a knish before but I couldn't stop... It was unbelievable. I thought I was stuffed but then they brought the bread pudding... Again unbelievably good. We ate the whole thing. Great , friendly staff. An absolute gem by US Airways Center and Chase Field. A just try!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, but the potato salad was not. Staff was friendly and I'll be back. Can't wait to try new sandwiches."}
{"text":"New York style deli- take out, dine in, catering. When people complain about the prices here, I'm guessing they haven't been to New York lately!!!  Carnegies charges $20+ sandwich that even 2 people can't finish.  The modest 8oz overstuffed Ruben is where it's at for $11.  This has kraut, dressing, melted Swiss, and your choice of corned beef or pastrami.  I of course choose the pastrami! Isn't that what Tommy would want?  Delicious homemade bread toasted with butter is filled with juicy thin pastrami.  Delicious dill potato salad is my side of choice and I want more... really solid ratios of ingredients keeping the sandwich not too messy to eat in front of respectable adults.  Steak fries are nice n' crispy too!  Turns out the owners are super friendly guys who took the time to personally make us feel at home.  They brought our order to the patio, rearranged umbrellas to give us the perfect amount of shade, and brought out to-go boxes.  Len shared stories of the real Tommy being super authentic half Jewish and half Italian guy.  Apparently Tommy flew out 4 times to taste the Phoenix bread to make sure the flavor was just right.  They serve complimentary coffee that's from a local roaster benefiting an autism charity."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible pastrami! Haven't had anything like it outside NYC. Oh and the sercive? Top notch. Very friendly staff who made me feel at home. Highly recommended if you're in the downtown area. Perfect before a game!"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!!!  We went here for a small dinner during the College Championship Festival downtown.  The restaurant is small, but they were equipped to handle larger crowds from the event by having a beverage girl out front and helpful staff throughout.  I'm pretty sure half the Phoenix Police Department was eating there, too, so we figured it had to be good.  We had potato knishes that were DELICIOUS with brown gravy, and chicken noodle soup.   As we were finishing up our dinner, the manager/owner? came out and offered the kids a complimentary bowl of ice cream and chatted with us for awhile. Nicest guy you'd ever meet!  Looking forward to returning to try out a classic Reuban!"}
{"text":"worst sandwich i ever had/ pastrami was made in a bag, not fresh, brisket dry bland not smoked. old soggy. made me small sandwich and charged me 15.45 for large, 1.00 for a pickle slice. called and told them they made wrong sandwich/ no apology/ no offer to make it right/ these guys are crooks. stay as far away from this place as you can. if they had a zero rating this place deserves it/ worstsandwich ever"}
{"text":"Great food, quick service, large portions, and terrific customer service - what more can you ask for!?!?"}
{"text":"NY Ruben  was amazing first time here  recommend this place to everyone. grilled cheese sandwich is really good too. great friendly staff most of all great food. get your self some.."}
{"text":"Food is AWESOME. Prices are ridiculous.  $12 for a half sandwich and a bag of chips?  Srsly?  Granted, the half sandwich was packed with deliciousness, but still way overpriced.  If you're rich and cruising your Ferrari downtown for entertainment, go for it.  If you're a working stiff with limited reasonable downtown lunch options like me, it wasn't a fair trade off for almost an hour's worth of my hard earned cash."}
{"text":"Great customer service and good food! Great prices before the Suns game. Wish I had taken pics, ate it too fast. Had Reuben with pastrami, chili fries and grilled cheese for my kids. Yes they have kids meals!"}
{"text":"The food was very good love the cornbeef and brisket I had the skyscraper sandwich and the sloppy T, which was my favorite. The price seemed a bit high but it was also delivery. I would defiantly check it out again, I'm curious to try the bread pudding."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this from a place because my favorite sandwich in the world might just be pastrami for a ribeye sandwich it's a toss-up but with pastrami in your name of your business it should be the greatest on Earth or not it was good meat was a little cold it was around 1 end of the lunch rush so may have been sitting around for awhile slavery was good just a little cold don't like the bread tasted a little older still not sure just very friendly staff and for a pastrami sandwich it was on the cheap side The Pickled tasted expired had a spit that out overall it was just ok might go back back to try again at least they don't microwave their stuff like everyone it is in the steamer"}
{"text":"They do pile the pastrami high, however the meat is shaved very thin so it got a but dry.  I had pastrami on rye with deli mustard so I felt that the dryness of the meat took away much of the flavor.  My buddies got the Ruben - toasted bread with cheese and 1000 island and left more satisfied, but you don't need more than mustard and good bread and meat to enjoy amazingly cooked pastrami.  3 stars."}
{"text":"I've been there three times now, and most likely won't be going back.  The food is decent but overpriced (IMHO), and the service is slow, which is okay if you're just killing time before a Suns game, but not so much when you're on a work lunch break.    I first got a turkey & cheese sandwich.  Well, I should say I paid for turkey and cheese, but they forgot the cheese (which they charge extra for).  The sandwich was literally bread and turkey, period.  The turkey itself was good, but overall the sandwich was incredibly plain (and $9 bucks for the half sandwich after tax).  And the wait was about 10 minutes.  The next time I went to check out their breakfast.  I was the only person in the restaurant, so you'd think it would be quick.  Nope.  It must have taken 3-4 minutes before the cook even came out.  Then another 8-10 minutes to cook two eggs, a slice of ham, and hash browns, and another couple of minutes to get someone else to wrap it all up and hand it to me.    The last time I got a bowl of chili and a hot dog.  Over $9 bucks, and another ridiculously long wait, made more aggravating by the fact that there were 2-3 employees just standing around.   When I got back to my office and opened up the bag, realized they didn't give me (or offer to give me) ketchup, mustard, or anything else for the hot dog.    It's too bad.  I really wanted to like this place.  I predict it won't last very long, but hopefully I'm wrong."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Not only is the food good but the staff here are really nice. Just the other day, I ate dinner here (a corned beef Sloppy T and amazing matzoh ball soup) then needed to place an order for a friend. I didn't realize that they had already closed down for the day. The guys at the counter and staff in the back let me order my turkey sandwich anyway which saved the day back at the office for my very hungry co-worker. Thank you all for your kindness and delicious comfort  food!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I went here with my girlfriend and one of her friends, and we all loved the food. I am a huge fan of corned beef and pastrami, so I got the sliders with steak fries. Not only was it the best pastrami I've ever had, but the corned beef was amazing and the steak fries were incredible. I felt very welcomed and the service was great. They will gladly explain the menu to new customers and the prices were not bad at all. Overall I would recommend it to anyone who loves sandwiches."}
{"text":"Incredible staff, very friendly and helpful! Wonderful food for the sandwich lover! I had brisket and my wife had sliders with pastrami and corned beef, both were delicious! The cost was great and the food came out quick and hot! It was such a nice place! Again the staff was awesome!"}
{"text":"The tuna sandwich is tasty and the tuna is nice and cold, as if it has been in a refrigerator rather than sitting out on an ice bath like most samdwich shops. The service was outstanding and I was checked on by both the cashier and sandwich maker to see if I was enjoying my lunch. Great spot and great food! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Such amazing service!!! Love the food!! First time but not my last time!!! Ugh heaven on a plate!!!"}
{"text":"Working a show at the convention center and this place came highly recommended!!! I wasn't disappointed it was amazing and fulled my belly !! I got the original pastrami!!!"}
{"text":"Super turkey sandwich!! Even just the half sandwich is filling.  Great and fast service."}
{"text":"As a 15 year resident of the NYC suburbs, I became a huge admirer of the pastrami sandwich at Katz's Deli, and also 2nd Avenue. Tommy Pastrami isn't like those, the pastrami isn't kept whole and hot in a steam cabinet, sliced by hand with a knife to order. They slice it cold, then put it on a griddle. Not ideal, when you watch them do it. But I have to admit, the result is a very tasty, satisfying hot pastrami sandwich.   Katz's was always inconveniently located for my usual routine, so I didn't go as much as I wanted. If Tommy Pastrami had been in my neighborhood, I might not have bothered with Katz's at all. Meat is very good, rye bread is just right, nice deli mustard, even the pickle is good. Free coffee all day is a nice bonus."}
{"text":"Going to have to try this place out again because of the reviews. I ordered the Philly cheesesteak with chili, and it actually tastes like a meatball sub. I do not like meatball subs. Not the Philly I was hoping for. I wasn't for the chili cheese fries either."}
{"text":"They seemed totally overwhelmed by the amount of people (which wasn't that many in my opinion) and the wait was WAY too long!!! It took so long, my meal partners had a chance to order pizza (next door) eat it completely before I got my simple corned beef sandwich. Not sure why slapping some meat and cheese on a French roll should take the immense time it did??? I won't be coming back and unless you have LOTS of extra time, which I didn't that day, I wouldn't recommend that you eat here. I was very disappointed, as I was looking forward to a good corn beef sandwich. The sandwich was okay, but nothing special. Good cole slaw, though."}
{"text":"Experience was good enough for me to create a YELP account. We had hot pastrami sandwiches. Hubby got Swiss on top. We got steak fries, potato salad and onion rings. The owner took our order and struck up a conversation. The food was wonderful, the employees were attentive and anticipated what we needed. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place not only has GREAT food, but the people and customer service is outstanding.  Highly recommended!!! -Stacy C"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service; will be back on next trip to Phoenix.  Had bee looking for a deli in Phoenix and thought I'd give this a try, it did not disappoint.."}
{"text":"Reasonable for how much you get.  Very tasty.  Mustard is very good little kick but Yummmmmmmm."}
{"text":"Food and staff were great!! I had the lite turkey with steak fries and was stuffed. Check this place out!!"}
{"text":"This place is the best I asked the owner if he could sell me some corn beef and bread to take to my step father who is Jewish, he sold me a pound for $14.99 very reasonable we got so many sandwiches and a pound of bread.  My Dad loved it said it was the best he has had in a long time.  I will be going back to this place often and I live in Apache Junction...kind of far to travel but worth it"}
{"text":"This place is great! Thank you for the great food loved the matzo soup and pastrami made me feel like I was back home. Thank you Len you are great!"}
{"text":"Pastrami pastrami how I love you!!!!!! Tommy Pastrami you rock my world! This place is so good!!!!!!!! I can't get enough. Fast, cheap good eats!"}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars! I had a to go order, which was made rather promptly. Chili soup was allright ... it was lacking taste. However,  the pastrami wrap was so delicious. The coleslaw was creamy and added a great kick to the overall taste. I also had a chicken soup with matzo ball- yum!"}
{"text":"A New York style deli based in Orange County, California with a Downtown Phoenix location.  Mmmkay.  For me, a true New York style deli is an old school place like Katz.  A cafeteria style deli where you grab a spot in line and choose your foods for your tray as you make your way to the register.  I've been to a number of delis here in the valley, but thusfar the only deli I've been to that can legitimately claim to operate the way Katz does is Miracle Mile Deli.  Tommy's by contrast is not cafeteria style, but nevertheless makes a conscious effort to serve many of the classics.  Pastrami, Corned Beef, Turkey, Tuna, Brisket, and even Beef Brisket are on the menu here.  Heck they've even got potato knishes.  Authenticity certainly isn't a strict requirement to earn my praise (though it could be for some).  For me, its all about the food.  In an effort to avoid the lunch crowds, I came here for an early dinner on a Thursday afternoon.  Tommy's is set on the bottom floor of the Collier Center, located on 2nd Street midway between Washington and Jefferson.  The interior has seating a little over 30 and shares a ton of outdoor patio seating with some adjoining restaurants.  Here you simply order up front, pick a seat, they call your number and you grab your food.  Since this is Tommy \"Pastrami\" I figured my first go around here would have to include the restaurant's namesake.  So an Original sized Pastrami sandwich it was.  Also went with their traditional Rye bread (truth be told I prefer Kaiser, but sadly that's not an option here).  Decided to make it a combo this time with a medium fountain drink and a side of their steak fries with gravy and a pickle.  Total cost for the combo meal plus tax came to about $17.  Let me first say that the Original sized sandwich is actually their largest size (referred to as overstuffed).  It was definitely stuffed, but I gotta say I've had overstuffed versions of pastrami at Miracle Mile and Chompie's here in town and their versions definitely have more meat.  Maybe a small issue, but just throwing it out there.  What meat this sandwich did have didn't disappoint.  Still wish I could've gone with kaiser bread instead but the pastrami itself was definitely solid.  The fries were fine but I'm honestly not sure what to make of the gravy.  The gravy was served on the side instead of on the fries (which I appreciated, actually).  But the flavor of the gravy was a little off to me.  I'm not sure as to the ingredients that go in this thing, but this gravy almost had a briny taste that I didn't expect.  It wasn't bad, just...well, weird.  All things considered the meal was fine.  It didn't blow me away by any means and parts of it were unexpected, but it was fine.  The restaurant itself was well kept and the staff were friendly.  But compared to other delis I've been to here in town and elsewhere, I just didn't feel like it measured up.  Perhaps my experience will be better the next go around, and maybe the next time will be to give their breakfast menu a try.  In the meantime, they could start winning me over by adding kaiser to their bread selection."}
{"text":"Put Tommy Pastrami on your list...I met the owners, who are THRILLED to be in downtown Phoenix. My choice of their HUGE Pastrami and Cole Slaw was a good one...  PERFECTLY grilled, with FRESHLY made slaw, plus the Kosher Dill Pickle added just the right touch. They deliver in the downtown area and are PROUD of their enterprise.   Check 'em out before or after a ballgame, concert or other event...if you love a Grilled Pastrami on Rye, Tommy Pastrami saves you the time, lodging and travel expenses to NYC. A TASTY addition to the PHX metro dining scene."}
{"text":"Amazing food, and great services! The Reuben was amazing! We stopped here for a quick bite and fell in love! I will for sure be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Had the hot pastrami and it made me 10 yrs younger. The Matzo soup is like Viagra"}
{"text":"Although flavorful, the rye bread was soaked.  We were really looking forward to a \"hot\" pastrami but the meat was hardly lukewarm bordering on room temperature.  We have no problem spending $30 on two sandwiches on a drink if it was worth it but these were not...will not return."}
{"text":"Myself and two of my students ate here while visiting Phoenix for a conference. The pastrami was excellently prepared; it was moist and flavorful. They even gave us a complimentary dessert of bread pudding with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! Talk about making a customer happy! Although you order at the counter, and the server brings you your food, it still has the customer service of a restaurant in that they check on you while you're eating and make sure everything is to your liking. The prices are great, and you get plenty of food for the price. I highly recommend Tommy's Pastrami!"}
{"text":"Literally the worst grilled cheese I have had. Looks like they put two slices of cheap American cheese on bread and burnt it under a salamander. Waited forever for this meal and I'm super disappointed that I paid to not eat this."}
{"text":"The food at Tommy's was DELISH had a pastrami sandwich, chicken soup,snd knish. What a tasty place, anything you order you won't be sorry!!! Can't wait to come back! Love Love Tommy's"}
{"text":"Had an excellent breakfast burrito w/salsa.  Reasonably priced as well. Completely unexpected find in downtown.  This plus coffee made for an excellent morning.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Taste is ok to good.   Getting food out in a reasonable time is not good.   At 12noon, took 15mins to order.  30mins to bring out a take out order of chicken soup and potato salad.  Both are precooked and should be done in no time.  Saw the same thing occurred to about half of the customer while waiting for food.  So if you have limited time for lunch, don't come in here."}
{"text":"Save your money! Go to your neighborhood supermarket and buy a pound of the best pastrami meat  and a \"real\" French roll and make yourself and then some a huge pastrami sandwiches! Way too expensive and you don't even get what you paid for. Total rip off! Im afraid to say that I only read a couple of the reviews and decided to try this place out. The young girl at the pick up counter was not pleasant at all, whereas the young fella who took my order was willing to answer my questions. Never coming back again"}
{"text":"Nice joint.  Ordered the full rueben with half pastrami and half corned beef.  Good amount of meat.  Bread was nice and kraut/sauce was good."}
{"text":"Oh my!   I can't believe I didn't know about this place until yesterday when I was heading to a Diamondbacks game.  This is by far the best deli in Phoenix. I had the Lite pastrami sandwich and it was excellent.  The fries were great steak fries and the service was excellent.    Just got info on their catering options and it is now on the rotation!  Can't wait to head back."}
{"text":"Awesome pastrami sandwich.  New York w Swiss and dressing. Left off sauerkraut. My brother and I shared. Plenty big. Best sandwich ever. Manager came over and talked with us. We were in our SF Giants gear. He welcomed us. He also treated us to a macaroon chocolate dipped cookie. Great customer service and food. Would definitely eat here again if in Phoenix. If you are a local I recommend it."}
{"text":"The food was very good. The prices however, are INSANE! $18 for an 8oz sandwich with nothing on it at all, but cheese and meat, 10 steak fries, and a drink. Go next door to Fired Pie. MUCH better deals."}
{"text":"My friend and I do Foodie Fridays and Tommy Pastrami was the place today. I had such high expectations. Thought I'd get an amazing pastrami sandwich because of the name Tommy Pastrami NY Deli but it was just ok. Potato salad was bland and I wanted a kinish but they were on back order. Back order? Why are they not making them in house? The pickle that came with the sandwich was awful. I think it was old. Not a very memorable experience."}
{"text":"The sandwich was great had a Ruben and my fried had the pastrami sandwich. .I think the Ruben could have used a bit more pastrami. .or I guess the next time I'll order the bigger whole sandwich.   Lol. .my friends half pastrami was stacked..little pricey with the Ala cart menu..definitely not a place to eat every day or you'll break the bank. ."}
{"text":"Fast. Food is very good. Good customer service. Serving pretty big. Glad I stopped at this place:)"}
{"text":"Great food SUPER amazing customer Service great deals on drinks in game day and super friendly"}
{"text":"Great place, terrific service! 1 buck domestic and 2 dollar import! Awesome pastrami.. a little hidden but worth the search."}
{"text":"Fantastic addition to downtown!  Love the fact that I can grab a HUGE delicious NY deli sandwich before the game and a beer for much less than concession prices.  No frills, no filler, just fresh baked bread and a TON of meat of your choice...THANK YOU for being here!!!  Don't forget the insane desserts as well!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a full Reuben. This is supposedly a NY Giant (\"Buy One Feed Two\"). I call BS. I should've taken a photo, but this was no \"giant\" sandwich. It was only a standard sandwich (about an inch thick) and definitely would not feed 2 people. This was ridiculous considering I paid over $17 for a sandwich and a drink! The sandwich was good, but I definitely won't be going back!"}
{"text":"I have very little to add thanks to my fellow Yelpers. I had the Pastrami on rye. It was the Original which also comes Lite and as a half. The meat was plenty for $11 and the seeded rye was homemade and good. Service was very friendly. I lived in NYC for a few years and this would have certainly made the cut in a Manhattan deli."}
{"text":"This place is a gem of a New York  sandwich shop only blocks from all the major downtown venues. While the food will never rival  Katz's or the Second Avenue Deli in NY the quality and taste are still really good. We had the corned beef and pastrami sandwiches The CB was tender and tasty if a bit salty. The texture of the pastrami was perfect. Not to lean or fatty but it had a mild middle of the road taste, The knishes were sub par. Try making your own. Not that hard to do. Add onion and pepper. After the meal, we ordered 2 dawgs for the stadium. Sabrett. Haven't seen that since back home. They were prepared with gobs of deli mustard and sauerkraut.   The franks were a mess to eat but man were they good. The owner and his son were really nice and they comped us desert. This place will be our go to place when we come in for concerts or games."}
{"text":"We were at comic con and discovered them by accident....they were not busy so of course I was leary....however I dressed like a nerd for the second time in my life, so why not try this empty restaurant ?  I loved this place. The food was spot on and our experience was one to share. If you like deli food we had the pastrami sandwich its big enough to share. Please come by the wait staff is friendly too. Thank you"}
{"text":"Holy Tommy Pastrami! Not only was the service extremely helpful but the food was phenomenal! The guy that was at the front was very bubbly & helpful (he was wearing a hat and had gauges) but what he told me to order was the best sandwich I think I've ever had! Next time I'm in I plan on bringing my dad and know he will become a regular. Good job guys, I'm so impressed!"}
{"text":"Food was good, huge portions though. I ordered the \"lite\" version and it was way too much to eat. Peach tea was really good too."}
{"text":"Try finding another place that isn't trying to serve you a fancy omelette at 7:30 in the morning in downtown Phoenix. This place had a great chili dog and the service as phenomenal. I spent an hour trying to find a place that was even open that served non-breakfast food and this place fit the bill perfectly."}
{"text":"This is just OK.  For the price of 10.95 for sandwich only.  8oz of pastrami and bread i would hope for a much more flavorful sandwich."}
{"text":"Can we rate it 6 out of 5?  300th review, and like many long time reviewers, I save the special numbers, for special places.  Tommy Pastrami is of of the great finds.   My wife LOVES pastrami and she's says it's as good as the NY leaders.  Not better but as good, that says alot coming from her.   I am a corned beef fan, and  the corned beef was juicy and flavorful, on great fresh rye bread. We both ordered 8 oz large sandwiches to take home half for the long flight home.  Excellent chicken noodle soup too! Of course, I had one of their knishes (imported from ny).   Surprise was their special bread pudding al la mode which they usually save for game nights. I am a bread pudding fan, and this was moist and sweet . With vanilla ice cream to balance  The owners were super nice on Friday before closing , not rushing, talking with us about the restaurant and about the beautiful State of Arizona. Very very friendly.  Ps coffee in shop is free. Buy their Coffee Beans whose proceeds go to a local program for adults with autism ."}
{"text":"I dont even know where to start.  just eat here dont think maybe just do it.  fing bomb"}
{"text":"Polite people but pastrami was lacking and they could have warned me that the chilli cheese fries were spicy seeing that it was obviously for my daughter"}
{"text":"Visit this hole in the wall restaurant when in Phoenix Sports venue area. The Pastrami is great ! And, they have excellent Deli Mustard at every table. Nice people too !"}
{"text":"I love love love their sandwiches, but today I had the mushroom barley beef soup and it is out of this world AMAZING!!  It is hearty and perfect for a cold day!"}
{"text":"Omg good!  Just what I needed after a long week I had the original corn beef w sour krout  on rye.. melt in your mouth. . Just like back home. . And partner had the original w pastrami on rye the steak fries were hot and great. . Also law enforcement and  fire gets a 10% discount. . Thank you guys we really appreciate it. See you tomorrow definitely  if you're visiting phx or from the Midwest to east coast and miss a real deli this is the spot. Enjoy!   Oh and the level of customer service is great. . You don't find that in AZ very often. ."}
{"text":"Really good pastrami.  I was a little concerned when I walked in, as they have lots of signs out but it was not that busy.  It should have been much busier judging by how good the sandwich, fries, and pickle were.  Reminded me of some delis I went to as a kid up in the North east."}
{"text":"The Reuben was delicious! Especially the rye bread- fresh! The thousand island was mmm-mmm good!"}
{"text":"Over priced for what you get.  They don't even put cheese on their pastrami sandwiches.  The meat was tasty though.  I'll pass on returning."}
{"text":"I was looking for a sandwich place after attending an event at US Airways Center.  I saw the signs outside for this place and decided to try.  So glad I decided to stop in.  The cashier recommended I get the slider combo and it was perfect.  I had one turkey slider and one brisket slider with homemade potato salad.  Amazing and loaded with meat and so tender.  I will definitely be coming back to try more!"}
{"text":"Great food good price nice atmosphere and they also sell beer soda root beer floats and much more."}
{"text":"If the actual finished product was anywhere near the same as the pictures on the menu, I'd rate this much higher, but the \"overstuffed\" Original Hot Corned Beef was at least an inch away from the pictures in actual substance. Thought I was getting a Carnegie Deli type sandwich for $11. Instead, more of an average sandwich. Not bad, but nothing to go back for, especially for $11."}
{"text":"My mouth waters for this place just writing this review!  Being from Hawaii I've only had an Authentic NY Pastrami sandwich once in my life.  Finding one to match that is tough experience being so far from the east coast.  Then I stumble into this place with a bunch of friends.  Tommy Pastrami maybe in downtown Phoenix, but has NY flavor!  I got the Halfer on Rye with a Potato Kinish with gravy.  Talk about YUM!  The manager offered that I try it with their strong horseradish mustard to go with it, and it was just the best!  I love that burn!  This is the first time I've had a Potato Kinish, the manger said they serve it with gravy, it's not traditional, but the locals love it, and so did I!  I still am not sure was a Kinish is but it's crispy and tasty.  Not to mention I wanted to drink their gravy.  Even the Halfer was to much and I had to take half of it home, they really pile on the meat.  We talked with the Manager as we ate, he was just such a great guy!  Telling us about the franchise, and at the end he said we had to end the meal with some NY cheesecake!  He gave us a free slice to share, and it was delightful!  I really can't wait to come back, just know they are closed on Sundays!  I made that mistake and was quite sad!"}
{"text":"Decided I would order from here since they participate in UberEats. I ordered the Grilled cheese Combo. It came with Grilled cheese and a side I chose to pair it with the tomato soup along with a drink all for 7.50. The Grilled cheese was amazing yet the soup lacked. It was way to chunky for my liking and salty. Hope to try the pastrami next."}
{"text":"Just a normal sandwich place.. smelled a lot like BO. I got the turkey sandwich (smallest size) and it was very expensive for a half of sandwich, i think around $7 for a HALF. Would not recommend but also not terrible."}
{"text":"New York has come to Arizona!  Hot Pastrami on homemade rye,so good thought I was at Katz's! Friendly staff and great food! The free dessert,OMG sooooooo good! Go there.. You won't regret it! You will just go back for more!"}
{"text":"Excellent pastrami!! The real thing! Good food and good prices, i come all the way from easy valley to come here, well worth it!!"}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing! Just thinking about it makes my mouth water! My husband and I split the pastrami rueben and I must say it was the best we have ever had! We live in Gilbert and drive to Phoenix just to eat there! The owner is very attentive and friendly! He takes pride in this establishment and it shows in the way he treats the customers as well as waits on them. I actually thought the prices were great for the quality of food! This is by far Phoenix's best kept secret!"}
{"text":"AMAZING customer service.  I called because ordering online was trying to charge me $4 service fee.  The manager took my order, waved the minimum AND delivered my food to my hotel himself!   The food was really good as well.  I had a pastrami slider and a corned beef slider.  I plan to eat there again next time I'm in the area for another conference or game."}
{"text":"If you want Pastrami on rye...  This is the place. I don't give 5 star ratings unless I'm WOWed. First, if you want a NY deli sandwich outside of Manhattan, good luck! Except I just had an amazing experience. Double baked caraway rye. Served steamed. Perfectly sliced, perfectly prepared pastrami. Forget the perfect garlic dill pickle slice, that's the cherry on top.  My first bite squishes into the steamed rye, the dark deli mustard coats my tongue in preparation for the grand prize...the pastrami from heaven.  I live 37 miles from this place. Just try to keep me away!"}
{"text":"This place is awsome,the folks here are friendly and service was phenomenal,clean establishment and it has a down home feeling like,you don't want to leave,they ask your name and make it personal,I definitely feel apart of the family,will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Closest thing to authentic deli I've had in Phoenix. Nice pastrami on the good rye with delicious mustard. Can't be beat! I've also tried the matzo ball soup. Soup itself is very tasty and the chicken is fresh. Matzo balls could use a bit more salt but the consistency was good. Nothing is ever going to compare to my bubbe's, so it's not even worth comparing and I'm certainly not going to deduct any stars for it. Prices are pretty good for the amount of food you get (portions are huge) and the service is excellent. I usually go for weekday lunch but I brought my family on a Saturday afternoon before a DBacks game and they gave the kids each a scoop of free ice cream with chocolate sauce. What a nice treat! My kids very much also enjoyed the delicious steak fries."}
{"text":"We had the NY Ruben sandwich and it was the best pastrami we had since our trip to New York. If you are downtown Phoenix, stop and eat here. You won't regret it. This will become our go to place from now on. The staff was friendly and made you feel at home."}
{"text":"Ordered pastrami sandwich. Average taste. Nothing special.  Pickle tasted bit weird. Hard to describe way it taste.   But this will be my first and last visit to this place."}
{"text":"Very helpful staff and the food is really good. They deliver to my home & work. They are fast & delivery is free. Thank you guys."}
{"text":"We were very impressed with the corned beef Reuben and hot pastrami. Meats were thinly sliced and tender! Portions are big but you can get 1/2 sandwich."}
{"text":"First time ever eating at Tommy's. Really great food...the sandwiches are to die for!  Service was excellent.....I would make it a point to come here again the next time I'm downtown!"}
{"text":"Not sure what to say. It's a very expensive sandwich that has nothing special to offer. Nor the bread or the spread is anything original or different from a Subway or other chain. IT's perfect if you are hungry and in the area, but I wouldn't go out of way"}
{"text":"This place is really a nice small establishment. Seemed family owned, great food, a tad pricey but still good. I tried the rueben sandwhich and it was very delicious. Place is kinda hidden in a building in the heart o downtown phoenix, n id say its worth checkn out n tryn it."}
{"text":"I eat here every time I'm downtown. The pastrami is excellent and the service is very efficient.  If you have a time crunch for lunch you can order out. I definitely recommend the Reuben and as a side try the potato salad it's really good. The manager and a the cashier's are very friendly and enthusiastic and very welcoming.  This place is centrally located for sporting event and theater."}
{"text":"Good sandwich, stale bread!  Looking so forward to trying this place.  Very disappointed.  Ended up just eating the meat out of the sandwich.  The pastrami was very good"}
{"text":"Owner is awesome and very excited about his food. Pastrami was excellent as was the tuna. Event nite - $2 beers. Can't believe we haven't been here before"}
{"text":"Hmmmm.  Today was either a really really bad day for this place, or it is the eighth wonder of the world how they are still in business   We arrived about 11:30 am.  The restaurant might have had 8 people in it...but they had already ordered and were seated.  Therefore, we immediately went to the counter and ordered.     35 minutes later most of our table got our food.   One person in our party was completely skipped.  But we had already wasted most of our lunch hour.   And by the time our buddy notified the staff that they skipped him, the line was out the door.   I feel bad for those people...and how long does it take to slice meat?    So I won't be going back.  Ever.  I got a turkey sandwich which was extremely average.  I got the \"lite\" version which was a fair amount of food.  The other guys I was with (the ones who were served), got the \"overstuffed\" version.   Which wasn't any more food than what I got...it just cost more."}
{"text":"Oops! We walked in right at 5 (when they're closing up? Says online they close at 5) but we had no idea from the all around great service. We are here now just really happy with the service and prices and food. Thank you to the staff and owners :) Sorry for keeping you open :("}
{"text":"Visiting the Science museum as we are only visiting AZ and were starving. Found this place on Yelp and so we walked over. The photos seemed mouth watering.. AND this place did NOT dissappoint! I had the Reuben and it was amazing! The onion rings were just enough batter and cooked to perfection. DO NOT SKIP THE CHEESECAKE! It was by far the best we have ever had... I will drive out of my way if ever back in AZ!!"}
{"text":"Had a pretty great Ruben. Management was very nice and even gave us a little sample of the bread pudding, which was delicious. Chicken soup with matzo ball was very good but the matzo ball was very solid, though I know that's how a lot of people like them. I tend to prefer mine a bit fluffier. It was a bit expensive but you get what you pay for. I'll be trying them again"}
{"text":"Not being a pastrami fan - but looking for something quick - my husband and daughter and I went here. I wasn't sure what to expect - but upon entering the owner came up and asked us if we had been there before - after saying no, he took the time to explain the menu and break down what each item was.  I ended up getting a brisket sandwich with au jus and my husband got the bbq brisket. We were super surprised just how delicious everything was. It was cooked perfectly and had plenty of flavor!   My daughter had gotten a kids meal which I don't remember being anything special (which lets face it is probably perfect for kids) and at the end she was able to get an ice cream for free.  We really enjoyed this place and its cozy atmosphere.  If we find ourselves in the same area again, we will definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today with co-workers for lunch.  First time eating here.  Prompt service, great sandwiches, reasonable prices, BIG pickles (I brought several home for the weekend!).  Seating is a little tight for groups bigger than 6-8.  I will definitely return the next time we want big good sandwiches."}
{"text":"Best Sandwich I've had in a while. The employees are so nice, too bad we're just staying in AZ for the weekend. A+++!!"}
{"text":"Nice interiors. Varied menu. Ordered the sliders combo, it was very good. The chili was awasome (consistency, flavor...) While visiting Phoenix Convention Center area, should be on the list to visit for lunch."}
{"text":"Great place tucked away across from the Tilted Kilt. I recommend the Hot Pastrami on Rye Bread! Food portions and owner (or Manager) was very friendly and conversed with his customers."}
{"text":"So delicious! I love NY delis. This place was such a great find. Stumbled upon it on my way to the Suns and it's instantly a new favorite spot. The Rueben was incredible. Get the steak fries with gravy! So so good. And the bread pudding is the perfect end to the meal. Definitely definitely would recommend and return as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Came in here for lunch before going back to work. The pictures on yelp looked great and I usually eat with my eyes anyways. I ordered the medium (i guess you can call it that) pastrami sandwich on rye bread. The food itself was about 3 stars. It cam with potato salad and a drink. I'm not a fan of New York style potato salad but I'm not holding that against them.I just wasn't impressed with the food itself. The pickle was pretty good. I gave it 5 stars because the staff is nice and i liked the service. Would I go back again...? Maybe, but the cost was pretty on par with the portion sizes."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to stop in before a Suns game.. they stay open on game night until the game starts .. so come early!!  It was my first visit, my bf loves the Ruben sandwich.. he comes here before sporting events.  I had the half pastrami on rye bread.. really good homemade rye bread.. it had plenty of flavorful meat with a squirt of spicy mustard .. the pickle and steak fries were great on the side.  Friendly staff .. checked on us and gave us a bread pudding ala mode for dessert on the house (loved it) just like someone's mom would make ..  They had a basket of rye bread end pieces at the end of the counter with a free sign.. took a piece home for a sandwich tomorrow..  Thanks for a great experience.. will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nothing really to rave about this establishment as far as pastrami. Their pastrami was on the dry side, typical pastrami deli joint in my opinion. I've had better pastrami that were more juicy perhaps adding ah jus would've been delightful."}
{"text":"If you like pastrami this place will meet your needs. Nothing fancy, just a good sandwich.  It's all really basic. Good food and decent prices.  I did really enjoy the homemade cole slaw."}
{"text":"Besides the food being extremely delicious the service is some of the best service in town. They are super nice and always making sure you have everything you need to enjoy your food. I would go back just for the service. However the food is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal!  I've had pastrami all over the country, in NY city many times, this was the best pastrami I've ever had!  Hot, juicy, tender, perfect. Price was very reasonable, potato salad was great and a delicious root beer float to top it off.  Highly recommend if you're looking for a great eat downtown.  They are mainly lunch, they close at 5. But they did say they stay open til 7 on game days."}
{"text":"I just tried the grilled cheese and tomato soup today. I've never had their tomato soup before and it was SOOOOO GOOD! It's not regular plain tomato soup, it's creamy, flavorful, and there are chunks of tomato and onions in it. The employees are always so nice too, they are friendly and joke around and are fun to interact with."}
{"text":"This place is right by my office so I've been walking past it for months.  One Friday night I decided to pick up a pastrami on rye sandwich to take home for dinner.  The meat was amazingly flavorful, the bread was fresh and it was enough for two of us to fill up.  The proprietor was so friendly and made sure I had everything I needed.  Definitely adding this place to my regular rotation of dining options!"}
{"text":"Watta deal! Game day bottle of beer for two bucks! Not so great deals are the other prices with an Original 8 oz. Pastrami on Rye for $10.95 with a pickle slice, and a knish for $3.75 and a Dr. Brown Cel-Ray soda for $2.50. If the sandwich would've been like the ones I'm used to in NYC, I wouldn't have minded the price as much, for those sandwiches were loaded with so much meat that you'd have to unhinge your jaw or do what I always did, take 2/3 of the meat home for another sandwich and have some with a fried egg for breakfast. That was the type of sandwich pictured on the walls, but not the kind that arrived on my plate. However, the meat was mighty good--flavorful and not at all like what Arby's and most others call pastrami where it seems the meat was extruded rather than sliced from a real hunk of meat.  The not-warm-enough and not plump enough knish's coating was separating from the potato filling and had a more rubbery texture than a really fresh knish would have, or maybe it was just reheated in a microwave rather than an oven. Flavor was authentic though. How delightful to have a place to grab a Dr. Brown's Cel-Ray soda; honestly, I don't know why more people outside of NY don't drink this refreshing drink that goes so well with salty foods just as beer does. Enjoyable to look around and view the NY memorabilia and be chatted to by friendly and eager-to-please staff. Sad that I was the only soul around dining, but it's not on the main sidewalk so that doesn't help with impulsive foot traffic."}
{"text":"Since moving away from NYC more than a decade ago, I I miss the pastrami. So of course when I saw this restaurant bc we were in the neighbors of Hard Rock Cafe , Scottsdale, I HAD to go in.  We ordered an original pastrami sandwich on rye.  Boy was it good. The only thing I wish was that the slices were sliced thicker but other than that it was delicious. The rye bread was made on premise and it was just perfect soft and you can smell and taste the rye.  The pastrami had the right balance of fat and meat on the slices which made it not too dry.  The dill pickle that accompanied it was just perfect, a little salty for me but nevertheless good. A staff came over and asked was everything was and said thank you and good when we left.  What else can you ask for Great customer service , and delicious foods! You need to go! Seriously folks."}
{"text":"We came here before a Diamondbacks game and it was fast, delicious and the service was spectacular!"}
{"text":"Fries were good. Sandwich was okay even though I found a hair in my corned beef sandwich! Pretty gross. This was my first time here, but after this incident I probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Had lunch a week ago with a colleague at Tommy Pastrami and it was DEE-LICIOUS! I had the pastrami sandwich with coleslaw, she had the split sandwich which is 2 different kinds of sandwiches, each on a slider bun. She, too, LOVED, her sandwiches: pastrami and the brisket dipped in au ju. The deli is REAL close to NY style.  (I'm an east coast girl. )It's clean, deli atmosphere and relatively quiet for taking.  There's outdoor seating too! Service is on point! My colleague asked about the catering service and the catering manager came out and introduced himself and gave us more information. Because I love in the neighborhood, I will be a regular!"}
{"text":"Called the Heath department after our visit. We watched the cashier handle money and wipe his nose and then touch our food without washing hand/using gloves. As it was they were slow and overpriced. Can't speak to how the food tasted because we left without eating after the sanitation issue."}
{"text":"The food was great and the staff was beyond friendly.  I had the ruben and it was better then I could have hoped.  The rye bread was very fresh and they used great quality meat.  The staff were all very friendly and you could tell they loved their product and jobs.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great.  Awesome food, owners are extremely nice and accommodating.  We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Is the phrase mouthgasm a word? That's exactly how I felt taking not only the first bite but the last bite of my Reuben sandwich. The pastrami melts in your mouth and bread tasted so fresh. The sauerkraut was amazing. First off the sandwich was packed full and well worth every penny spent.  When I went there was a large line and the people kept coming. Even with all these people the customer service was phenomenal and the orders were made and delivered at a great pace. I thought the quality of the food was great for rush that arrived.  The staff was so friendly and even took the time to explain the menu questions I had without making me feel rushed despite the growing amount of customers.  The restaurant was clean and felt cozy while you waited for your food. I instantly fell in love with this place and recommend it to everyone who ventures downtown. They have a nice patio to eat on if you prefer."}
{"text":"I give this place a solid four stars! The Ruben was delicious including the spectacular onion rings! The employee's there are very thoughtful and friendly, I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Just drove 40minutes to get my fix of pastrami. They are clearly open but refuse to take my order due to a large catering order.   Quick fix- get more hands in the kitchen.  Extremely frustrated and won't return any time soon.  So much for driving around, paying for parking and leaving pastrami-less"}
{"text":"Hard to find a decent deli in Phoenix. Tommy P is a winner.  These folks make a good sandwich. They have a big variety and the sandwiches are packed with meat."}
{"text":"**UPDATE** The owner was the guy at the pick up counter and reached out to me fairly quickly. I believe an hour after my post. He apologized and explained that they turn off all Yelp orders on convention days and he's not sure how my order got through. He invited me to come back so they can make it right. I wasn't able to get back but just the fact that he offered and apologized meant a great deal. Most places and most people won't do that so thank you Len.  PS The food was really good.  I ordered through Yelp at 12:42 pm. I had to reorder at 1:04 pm because I went to ask if they were working on my order and they said \"We're too busy so we cancelled your order. We were going to call you right now.\" They never apologized. In fact, the girl helping me asked an older lady about the order and she kind of shrugged with a \"too bad\" attitude and said they're too busy. Terrible customer service. I haven't gotten my food and honestly I'm not really sure if I even want it anymore because now I just have a bad taste in my mouth. If my husband and I weren't on a time restriction for a conference I'd probably ask for my money back. The guy at the pick up counter was nice so I guess there's one star for that."}
{"text":"Delicious pastrami sandwich. Their homemade rye bread was absolutely out of this world. I would recommend requesting the pastrami on toasted rye bread for that added crunch. Service was fantastic. Friendly staff. Would certainly come back time and again. Very affordable for downtown Eatery."}
{"text":"This was our first time coming here. They were super helpful with explaining the menu and had awesome recommendations! We decided on sharing a Ruben which was absolutely delicious!! The staff were all super friendly and fast!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. My girlfriend gets the grilled cheese and tomato soup. The grilled cheese is average and good, they let you choose the cheese which is cool. I get the pastrami sandwich no mustard with au ju, which is very good. The reason for my three stars is that they're never open. Like, their store hours are already super restricted. But we'll drive over there during store hours and it will randomly be closed; No sign on the door. Your food can be bomb as **** but if you're never open then?? Frustrating. Worth the visit though. Call before you make the drive (and bring coins for the parking meter)."}
{"text":"This place has been on my must visit list for a while as I love a good Reuben Sandwich. When I arrived the cashier was rude and advised they no longer offer a Reuben. Let me get this straight, a NY style pastrami sandwich shop which doesn't offer a Reuben? And your going to be rude to me on my first visit? With that I walked out and took my business to Miracle Mile who makes the best Reuben in the valley. Sorry Tommy, you let me down big time!"}
{"text":"I felt a cold coming on and my go to remedy is the homemade Chicken Soup from Tommy Pastrami!  It has shredded chicken, carrots, onions and celery with bow tie pasta!! Besides their amazing sandwiches, that I love, this soup is just a delicious comfort food!! They also have split pea soup on Mondays! Pastrami lovers buy a bottle of their tasty mustard that's flown in from New York!! The staff is wonderful and friendly!! Thank you Tommy Pastrami for making me feel much better"}
{"text":"Phenomenal Reuben! Great find in downtown Phoenix. The pastrami is tender and full of flavor, great rye & I loved the thousand island dressing."}
{"text":"Decent place for a pastrami sandwich, large and very filling. We shared one on an early afternoon to hold us over to dinner. The steak fries were very good. Very friendly staff, both at time of ordering and as we were seated inside when they checked on us. Would return and try more if we lived here."}
{"text":"I drive a truck for a living,  so I have been to many restaurants to grab a bite to eat. I can honestly say that Tommy Pastrami has the best breakfast burritos in town.  I was left very satisfied with the quality and the size of their meal."}
{"text":"Far and away, the best Pastrami and Corned Beef in the valley. Most like New York City delis."}
{"text":"Great sandwhiches hands down awesome pastrami... Cant wait to come back and try the skyscraper..."}
{"text":"Absolutely delish!!! We have gone there the past two years when we go to a conference in phx.  My sandwich was so amazing and at least 7 people asked me what I ordered as I was eating my meal. Can't wait to go back in a few months."}
{"text":"I had the reuben, it was excellent.  My co-worker had the pastrmi, also excellent.  I would rate the reuben in my top 3 lifetime reuben sandwiches."}
{"text":"First..201 Washington. Actually its on 3rd, mid block between Washington and Jefferson.  Once we found it, (from Tucson area) the food is excellent.  Pastrami sandwich is pilled high and my wife had the turkey (Butterball).  Very good. The rye bread is fresh each day.  Len, the manager was most friendly and told us of the many new things coming to downtown Phoenix.  Will most certainly go back on our next trip up that way."}
{"text":"Definitely the most authentic Pastrami & Corned Beef Sandwhiches in AZ. After visiting Tommy Pastrami, I kick myself for wasting my time and money at all the other so-called \"authentic\" delis in the valley area!   If you want my opinion, get the Reuben; it's unbelievable. If you're old school: go the corned-beef-on-rye route. The Sandwhiches are piled high and will leave you in heaven!   Also, the Sandwhiches are priced right(They import all of their meats. Hey, those import fees aren't cheap!).  The owners are hard working and are there all day every day. Staff seems to be friendly, upbeat, and engaged. The owners must be doing something right!  Check these guys out, they're the best!!!"}
{"text":"I went here with work colleagues for a casual lunch.  I am very picky about my sandwiches and I will say the Pastrami is very good, the Reuben sandwich wasn't.  Perfecting the Reuben is an art form, but, with such great ingredients I expected better.  The bread was soggy immediately and the sandwich completely fell apart as I tried to eat it  so I finished it with a fork.  Again the Pastrami was great.  The pickle served with the sandwich was mediocre but edible.  My colleagues both had turkey(one on wheat the other on rye) and they really enjoyed their sandwiches.  I tried the rye bread separately from my Reuben and it was excellent.  I will be back to try different sandwiches because the rye bread and Pastrami were really good and the staff was really friendly."}
{"text":"Great hot pastrami sandwich and ready when we got there on our lunch break!  I would recommend calling and placing your food order ahead of time if you are on a break.  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Finally a real knish in Phx!  They also have Sabrets in the natural casing. Best NY deli in Az by far!!"}
{"text":"Our office ate here for breakfast this morning, and we are all very satisfied! The breakfast sandwiches are grilled and stuffed with steaming hot eggs, cheese, and in my case, bacon. Honestly, some mighty fine bacon indeed.  I've been here a few times for lunch and have enjoyed every meal I've tried. My first time, I had the slider combo. The pastrami and corned beef were good, but not super filling. I can be a big eater, and even with the chips and orange soda, I could still have eaten more. My next time, I ordered the Sloppy T and two hot dawgs. Again, very good but I should have ordered more. So when I got around to ordering The Original, I was quite stoked. Would this be the gut buster that stuffed my belly? Almost. Again, sometimes I can be a binge eater.  As others have mentioned, this place isn't cheap. But we're downtown, and their prices are competitive. Service is friendly and attentive. If you're in a time crunch, I've suggest calling your order in ahead of time, though."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  At the end I have to give it a big meh.  Ordered the original pastrami and chili cheese fries.  If you have pastrami in your name, I set the bar a little higher expectations wise.  At best the pastrami was average...and I'm not sure it cleared that bar.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't special.    The chili cheese fries were a total miss.  First they use steak fries.  In my book steak fries are questionable at best.  Once again, they didn't clear the questionable bar.  They seemed to be soggy with not even a hint of crispness.  The chili was ok, but not special.  There didn't seem to be enough of anything (sauce, meat, beans) in the chili.  The cheese was ok (not a high bar to clear).  I happened to be downtown today.  Nothing happened here that would bring me back.  For what its worth...the staff seemed helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Loved the name of the restaurant Tommy Pastrami and looking forward something in of fast before the Suns game.  The 1/2 pound of Pastrami sounded pretty good but did not seem like a half pound of Pastrami.   Sandwich was good but expectations did not meet my hunger that day"}
{"text":"Being a native of NJ I have had the ultimate pastrami sandwiches in NYC. With that being said this place definitely delivers high quality and excellent tasting sandwiches. My husband and I are absolutely thrilled we tried this place. It was slightly difficult to locate. They are located in the Collier Building under the huge orange canopy. Staff here is amazing. The owner takes the time to greet every customer individually and came to our table to chat and see of we enjoyed everything. THUMBS UP  Highly recommended!"}
