{"text":"amazing view city lights menu is always different wich is plus for me i rather have something different every time its definitely and experience to remember staff is wonderful made sure everything was perfect"}
{"text":"My father asked to eat here for Father's Day. Compass Arizona is a very beautiful restaurant; clean and comfortable. The wait staff was all very polite and accommodating.  My only complaint is the price to food quality. Meal portions are small but expensive. Everything is prepared well but I've eaten just as good for a lot cheaper. I guess you pay to sit 24 stories up in a revolving restaurant.  Dad was happy, though, and thoroughly enjoyed himself."}
{"text":"I took my wife there for her birthday. The service was great and the food we ordered was delicious.  We also loved the wide variety of wine selection. She absolutely loved it and we will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Its funny how people give this place 4 stars and blame the price on the view. View of what? Construction and desert. Oh, it spins? Well that's cool, here's $50. Mediocre at very best. This place is what is wrong with this city. The food is boring and bland, the drinks are fair and overpriced, and the atmosphere is stuffy and overrated. I would suggest trying something new. Come on Phoenix, break the bubble I dare you."}
{"text":"Usually have a great time having dinner here. Steaks were cooked wrong. Food was just not right. Used to be a go to spot for us, not anymore."}
{"text":"Went to Compass last night to celebrate my birthday. All my friends were excited since none of us had been there. We went after school, 9 p.m.  As soon as we arrived the staff seemed to be annoyed by the size of our group, customer service very low at this point... should have turned around and gone somewhere else.   But we pushed on, they sit us 10 minutes later and our waiter Julian, comes to \"greet\" us. First thing that comes out of his mouth is something like... just to let you know is going to take 30-45 minutes to get your checks. I asked him why he was talking about the check if we've just arrived. He said, just letting you know in case anyone has to leave, and to make things simpler. Not sure what that really meant... we asked about the reverse happy hour and he quickly mumbled through the list. It was loud and was hard to hear. We asked him to repeat them again because we only caught about half of it. He seemed frustrated, we are all from different countries, Colombia, Bosnia, Serbia, Argentina, Bangkok and of course from all parts of the U.S... so it's not about the accent, is about good customer service.   He carded everyone, which is good, but one of my friends couldnt find her id. Understandably he couldn't serve her any alcohol. We are all adults, we understood. But he went on to give us a speech about it, like we were children needing some parenting time. We are all between 25-35... really? no need for that. Our behavior was appropiate, we were curtious and understood that he could not serve her alcohol. He came later to re-card my friends from Bangkok because he forgot which didn't have her id. Really? Is it because they are both asian, apparently Julian couldn't tell the difference between one asian and another asian... just plain rude.  I tried to get to change his mood by speaking to him in Spanish... he was short and dry. At this point I am willing to ignore him and move on.   The Specialty Drink sucked. No way to say it better... watered down and lacking taste... isn't it supposed to be special? Hence the name. About 10 minutes later he shows up asks us how we want the checks split. I said, why are we doing that, are we leaving already? He said, \"just making things easier\" and left. Five minutes later he arrived with our checks... I guess we are leaving! He didn't even asks us if we wanted another drink. Just because we inquired about happy hour doesn't mean that we are cheap or that we will only have one drink...We are all working professionals working on a graduate degree, and even if we were just students, even if we were on a thight budget, wouldn't you still want our business?   The view was great, and the ambiance was OK. Louder than I expected it.  Customer service: horrendous, below, below horrendous if that is even possible. I work downtown and because of my position I come accross many people in an every day basis. Compass will never be a place I recommend to anyone. I wish there was an option to leave 0 stars."}
{"text":"The views were spectacular, drinks were fantastic. Don't expect stellar service, however. We were told we couldn't wait in the lounge due to others waiting for those seats. By the time we were seated no one had sat in the lounge. At one point I was given a gesture by our server that felt like a \"wait your turn\" when I was trying to get her attention.  We were always flagging people down for things like the bill or salt. Yes salt-the Brussel sprouts and mushroom bolognese were underseasoned.   I would go back again for the amazing sunset, but that's about all."}
{"text":"The view and service were great. I ordered the steak medallions with mashed potatoes. They were good, I just wasn't a huge fan of the sweet sauce on it. overall, great experience."}
{"text":"We had reservations for four at this restaurant on a Friday evening. They try to seat you by the windows so you can 'slowly' take in all the 'AZ Views' of downtown. It's great at night because you see all the lights, but downtown AZ isn't all that great. The servers were nice, our server said she had been there for more than 20 years! Wow! They start you off with a really delicious corn bread and butter. We kept asking for more! Their lobster bisque soup was good too but I could not finish the entire bowl. Their scallops were recommended but were not that tasty. The salmon was probably my favorite dish that evening. The lighting is a bit dim inside so you can barely see your food. Haha. Nice, initmate dining experience. It was nice for our first time at a revolving restaurant. Be aware, it is pricey."}
{"text":"Really cool place. Staff was friendly. Food was really good. We ordered the ribeye steak and salmon. The steak was cooked perfectly and the salmon was not over cooked. I would go back. This is a great place to either take a date or someone new to Phoenix. You get a great view of the entire city."}
{"text":"Best meal I have had in a long, long time.  Bourbon filet was perfect and delicious accompaniments.  Service couldn't be better.  It really is as good as it gets accompanied by fabulous views of our beautiful Valley.  Make reservations and go!  You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"This Hyatt is a dicotomy.  Very nice people at the front desk. Valet was awesome. Bellhop was excellent.  But...  We went to our room and...there was someone in it. Luckily the fellow wasn't visible...that would have been bad for everyone. Especially...if...(shudder)...forget it  So we went back down and they gave us an unoccupied room (yay!!!)   As an apology, they gave us a card for a couple of drinks at the Compass, the rotating restaurant on the roof.  So we sat there for 22 minutes before we got our drinks. There was a problem and it took another 18 to get it solved,  So we decided that we couldn't eat there...we might die of hunger before we received our food. So we went downstairs to the sports bar. Networks (?) I think is the name. We were seated immediately and an excellent server named Drew took care of us very well.  Will we return to the Hyatt if we come back to Phoenix? Possibly...but there is no way that we will be back to the Compass, cool view notwithstanding."}
{"text":"The view is spectacular.  Had zero luck making  reservation online. Called the hotel directly only to get transferred 3x to the same voice recording. So basically  impossible  to make reservations prior to opening. No bass on the menu but online menu it is.  We both were looking forward to. Excellent German wine selection."}
{"text":"The views are beautiful. The entire restaurant rotates slowly to give you a great view of downtown Phoenix but the food is AWFUL! They served bread with butter that was hard..I really despise that move guys. The calamari tasted weird. The pot roast was in one word YUCK! The meat was fatty and served with a dark sauce that left a seriously bitter taste in your mouth. It came with half raw broccoli and bitter hard turnips. The place poses as a classy restaurant yet it was so obnouxiously loud it is comparable to a sportsbar during the superbowl game. So here it is: 2 thumbs down. Do not eat there. It is just not good at all."}
{"text":"Compass sits atop a tall building in downtown Phoenix providing a panoramic view of the city. Very beautiful. You get to enjoy different part of the city as the Compass slowly turn while you enjoy your meal. The food is ok not great. The presentation was nice but tastes need to be better. If the view is not there, I would give 3 stars for the food."}
{"text":"Great Views and good service. The food is nothing special but that's not why you come here.   We had the sausage flat bread for an appetizer which was probably the best part of our meal. We had a pear salad after that which was just OK and it was super tiny!  The steak was good but not great. Like a Black Angus quality.  Dessert was the worst part of the meal.  Don't get the cheesecake!  It was not good at all and really tiny. They also charged us 7.50 to split our meal. Which we share a meal at every restaurant we eat at and no one ever charges us ( even at fancier restaurants with better food).  So really if you're going here get the flat bread and a drink and enjoy the view. I would skip dinner."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been trying to get a reservation here for 3 years for Valentine's Day and were finally able to this year.  We arrived early & enjoyed a nice drink down in the lobby bar before taking the fast elevator up to the Restaurant.  We were still early, but they were able to get us right in and immediately the ambiance of the Restaurant and the view of the city were amazing.  They gave my wife a long stem rose and wished us both Happy Valentine's day which we both thought was very cool.  Our Waitress and her assistant were both very good and our drinks stayed full the entire meal.  The Food was amazing.  It's not food we have each day, so it was certainly a treat for us.  They even had 2 little surprises during the meal from the chef that was over and beyond what was expected.  Even though it was a holiday, our meal was never rushed.  Having the Restaurant revolve and being able to see the entire city during sunset made the meal & the experience even better.  Overall the food, ambiance, experience and service was outstanding and we will certainly be going back again soon."}
{"text":"This place is a fun experience.  To be clear, you don't go there for the food....you go for the experience.  The view is outstanding.  We've been going every year or two for many years to see the entire central city, sunsets, incoming airplanes, and lightning storms in the distance.  We watched both gigantic sports stadiums being built below us and have even caught a local haboob (giant dust storm)  boiling up from the south.  Little kids could go if they are really well-behaved (it's a quiet setting), and teens will think it's cool.  Grandparents and great-grandparents love it!  While slightly spendy, this experience is fun for all ages.  Life is short....find the silver linings....the Compass Room is a fun restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful views, friendly service, excellent meal."}
{"text":"Sad, this once elegant dining venue has totally fallen to pieces! Desserts and late night drinks were always a must, but no more. They have Absolutely nothing to choose from and when you do, it is inedible to say the least. Just skip this place totally. Elegance gone bad! Very sad. An icon that has lost her appeal. You know it's bad when the servers are blah about the food!"}
{"text":"Beautiful views....wonderful service...limited menu though....would have enjoyed more choices..."}
{"text":"The view and the service was amazing. I had steak, mac and cheese, salad, and fondue. The mac and cheese and fondue were great but my steak was under cooked. The price was a bit high as well. 4 people no alcohol $220 price tag."}
{"text":"Romantic restaurant with a beautiful view of Phoenix.   Amazing cornbread.   Ordered:   Caprese flatbread - delicious and large portion  Mixed Grill - they ran out of the lamb so they replaced it with the filet. not sure what the lamb tasted like. Everything on there was delicious though. good portion size   Creme Brulee Trio - the sugar on top covers up the flavors of the creme brulee. even without the sugar, i couldn't taste the green tea one. wouldnt recommend.   Only CON i have is that they did take a while to bring the food out. The restaurant was pretty empty so not sure why. It didnt bother me has much because of the fantastic view and friendly staff.   Highly recommend for a date just be prepared to pay a little more."}
{"text":"Our 1st time dining at Compass AZ Grill began with a phone call asking for directions and information. Brittany was very pleasant and helpful.  The atmosphere at the Grill was one of a kind. Jerry and the wait staff did all they could to make sure we had a good time. (and my water glass never ran out!)  We ordered 3 steaks to different \"doneness\" and they were all cooked to PERFECTION!!  We will definitely return! Thank you for providing a memorable evening for us!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great time here celebrating our anniversary. Great views of downtown, the service was good. However keep in mind it's not a fast paced kind of restaurant, but it's probably to give time to enjoy the views as the restaurant turns and gives you a 360 view of downtown Phoenix.  The waiter was great and we had a good time!"}
{"text":"Amazing view of the downtown Phoenix area, and it rotates! Gotta try dinner at sunset up there for a really great experience. Really quite and relaxing atmosphere, I can't think of anywhere else in Phoenix that you can get a view like this from."}
{"text":"Come for the view, stay for the bland and overcooked steak. Friendly service with awesome city views and uninspired food."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Went for dinner and the view was great. Saw the sun setting into the downtown skyline was very nice. The restaurant's slow spin was not intrusive at all.  Service: Made reservations in advance and was seated immediately. The wait staff was very quick. Food came out timely.  Food: Had one of the salads as an appetizer and it was good but not amazing. Same for the rib-eye. Did not really wow me with the flavor. Entrees were a la carte which was expected of these types of restaurants."}
{"text":"The place was really nice. I thought it was pretty cool how the place rotates in a circle. Great view of the city. The service was great as well. However, the food was just ok"}
{"text":"Great Experience!  My company had a party of 16 and I couldn't of been more pleased with the service.  All the food came out together seamlessly.  The beverages were quick and always full.  Not once did I ever turn around looking for staff.  Thank you for a great night!"}
{"text":"Great place to view Downtown Phoenix. Beautiful sunset. Simple, tasteful menu . Our entrees were cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"The Compass Grill is a great  way to start off the evening in downtown Phoenix, especially if you've never been to Phoenix (or a revolving restaurant). The panoramic, 360 degree view-in-an-hour is a unique  experience.  As a restaurant, I  felt  the menu was a bit pricey (I call it view tax) and limited so I didnt eat  here (I've been  twice). But as a bar, they had a reasonably priced  wine selection and of course the best  view in town. Great service too.  I give this spinny bar 5 stars."}
{"text":"We have lived here for 8 years but this was our first visit. We were celebrating our friends' anniversary. We all loved it. The ambience is elegant, the staff are attentive, the meal was tasty with nice presentation, the views were fantastic. We have been to other revolving restaurants elsewhere in the world where the view was the best part of the experience and the meal was average at best. And so we didn't have high expectations for the meal but wanted the experience/novelty of breathtaking views. Much to our pleasant surprise, the meal was great. Three of us had the Bistro Steak Medallions which was very tender with a delightful tasty sauce. Our other friend had the Free Range Chicken Breast....both entrees were excellent choices. We will definitely be back and try another menu choice. The next time our expectations will be for another fine meal."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of friends for a date night with our husbands. We had high expectations for the restaurant and unfortunately we were let down. Three of us ordered steaks. All of the steaks were lukewarm when we got our plates. I asked for my steak to be cooked medium. When I got it, it was tough, hard to cut through, and completely well done throughout. My friend ordered her steak medium rare and it was barely pink at all. We both sent our steaks back to have new ones properly cooked.  When we received the new steaks they both were lukewarm on the outside and cold on the inside. They must be microwaving the steaks. The macaroni and cheese that came with the sirloin steak was pretty tasty though. I'm glad I paid $39 for my plate to enjoy only the Mac and cheese and to take the steak home to my dogs. I'm sure they will enjoy it more than I did.  The dessert menu left much to be desired.  After reviewing the options, we chose to skip dessert since there was nothing appealing on the menu and we were all pretty frustrated with our meals.  As my husband said, you can get a better steak at Applebee's."}
{"text":"It was a good experienced,  but for the quality of the food I think is over priced. Like it not loving it. Tried it but not coming back. We also stayed at the hotel and definitely the hotel is a come back!   If you haven't visit this restaurant try it, give it a chance it's just not for me."}
{"text":"Wow, what great service I had! Angela Bullion and David really know how to treat you. They really made sure that I have everything I needed and then some. I had the scallops and would definitely recommend them. It was the perfect way to end my trip in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Went to the Compass Room for a Holiday dinner.  We don't mind paying more for outstanding food and service, but I felt  this restaurant delivered neither.  With the steep prices, it stung a little more that the experience was not excellent.  Service was relatively slow, and the main dishes were mediocre.  True, the view is spectacular, and the drinks are very good.  But the food and service were a disappointment.  I think there were not enough servers on staff that night, which could have accounted for the sluggish service, but I expect a restaurant of this caliber to always have adequate staff on hand!  I would not go back for dinner.  Maybe just drinks or dessert, and to enjoy the view,"}
{"text":"The view is second to none. Brittany,my cocktail waitress, is what any waitress should aspire to be. Friendly, well-informed, affable, generally a great person and server. The bar tender however is a disappointment. He (or she) has absolutely no idea how to make a White Russian, a cocktail that's been around for ages. First one was extremely weak, possibly lacking vodka. Second was essentially a glass of half and half that was walked past a bottle of Kahlua.  Hard to conceive a place as prestigious as the Hyatt having such an uninformed bartender."}
{"text":"Took my wife here for the first time and for our  anniversary. The view was excellent and the service was great. food was slightly over salted, but enjoyed it for the most part. the corn bread they bring out before the meal is pretty amazing. Salad portion sizes are smaller than expected but they were delicious."}
{"text":"My experience at The Compass Room was one I will never forget. My boyfriend surprised me and took me here for our anniversary.  The food was phenomonal, the veiw was spectacular,the staff was polite as could be and our waitress, Jerry was just amazing all around! She even had the chef write \"happy anniversary\" on our dessert!:)  Again, an experience I will never forget and will always hold dear to my heart."}
{"text":"GREAT VIEW More of an experience restaurant than a \"ooh gotta go there for the food\" restaurant Super upscale and classy. Food wak ok but NOT worth the price. Maybe go for dessert and enjoy the view!"}
{"text":"Went in for vday. No bar inside so you can either wait in the waiting room or go down stairs in the lobby / bar area. It's about 24 stories high so you get an great view from the inside. Food was great and so was the atmosphere. Staff was nice and friendly. Restaurant rotates so you get an 360 view of down town Phoenix."}
{"text":"I AM GIVING THIS 4 STARS PURELY FOR THE VIEW. The food, don't bother!! Go here and get a drink or two but don't eat the food. Or you can just get an appetizer or dessert. I love the view here and the fact that the room rotates, fun!! If you haven't been, you definitely should!! It is just very, very different for Phoenix. The best time to go is around sunset. I used to go on special occasions and would just get a drink and enjoy the view. But the view, it is really truly awesome and fun!!  Soo romantic & intimate.. now just to get my guy to actually want to go for the view (he's heard the food is bad)."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great dinner and better yet the views were incredible.   Our party selected pretty much half the menu which included the following:  For starters we really enjoyed the blue corn calamari.  This had just the right twist on an all time favorite.  The sweet blue corn was definitely a welcoming surprise.   Next our entrees included:  Bourbon Filet, Berkshire Pork chop, herb crusted skuna bay salmon (DELICIOUS), pan seared white sea bass and pan seared chicken all of which were very delicious selections.  The only complaint was on the filet...it was a tad dry for our taste however the cauliflower that was paired up with it was very pleasant.   Over all the service and the establishment itself was a great experience.   Great place for anniversary's, Birthdays or just a great date night out."}
{"text":"Certainly are paying for the views.  Food is marginal.  Service was good.  We were asked if there was a reason for our visit and we mentioned several times we were there for my daughter's 18th birthday.  I was a bit disappointed that not one thing was offered to make her feel special.  Maybe a scoop ice cream or a cookie would have been a nice gesture - like most restaurants offer.  Hummm....???"}
{"text":"Wow! What an amazing dining experience here at The Compass Arizona Grill at the Hyatt Downtown Phoenix! Everyone from the hostesses to the servers assistant to the server were phenomenal! Hostesses Miranda and Cari were so sweet (as always!), David was very polite and professional, and our server, Maria was an absolute joy and true expert in her profession. She was friendly but not intrusive, knowledgeable, and showed that she enjoys what she does. She offered wonderful selections for us, she gave me a sampling of different wines to choose from to accompany my perfect filet mignon. And the chefs...Bravo! Even though I was not particularly a fan of the Blue Corn Calamari (I wasn't exactly expecting what had come out), I did appreciate and enjoy their take on the popular dish as it was more like a southwestern salad with the Blue Corn Calamari, Arugula, corn, and dressing decorating the plate beneath. THE BRIE FONDUE.....I could nosh on that for days! Creamy, smooth, perfect taste with their Noble Bread. Sweet, salty, savory all in one. It's a must. The Filet Mignon was cooked to a perfect temperature. Silky, full flavor, and just...wow. We did order dessert to go and haven't had a chance to dig in, but we did order the Black & White Cake...and I can safely assume it will be just as delicious!  I almost forgot the pièce de résistance! You're on top of the city with 360° view of Downtown Phoenix. That's right folks, it's a ROTATING restaurant! One full rotation take roughly an hour (expect at least 1.5-2 hours for a full relaxing/enjoyable meal -yes they do validate for up to 2 hours!). Although we only had two full rotations, it felt as if we went around 4 times! If you get motion sickness, don't worry- you really don't feel the movement at all, and they do offer seating away from the window, but not too far that you don't get a beautiful view."}
{"text":"The view was great, food and service were not. I think because we had a party over 6 and 18% gratuity was already included our server really acted like he gave a rats ass about us. I mean completely ignored us on several occasions and seemed irritated one of the members of our party was late and then was pissy and acted like we were a waste of his time the rest of the meal. Took an excruciating long time to get our food. Pork belly tostadas were good because its bacon, but the bacon was overcooked and were more like bacon croutons on two itty bitty tacos. Our medium rare steaks  ended up being medium well and needed more seasoning. Brussel sprouts were not fully cooked but must have been put in the broiler as the inside was raw and the outside burned. Save your money and take a night hike for a nice view."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food, a little pricey but nice for a special occasion. We think they should pay for parking, that is an extra expense you shouldn't have to pay."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our experience here. Service was top notch, she was very attentive and personable with our group of 6.   The food was very good. Personally, I had the Shrimp Pesto Linguini and was not disappointed. The shrimp was cooked to perfection and the pesto was not overwhelming.   The atmosphere was excellent for the occasion. The 360 degree view is the reason for our visit and we were all pleased.   The food was a bit pricey, but overall it was worth it."}
{"text":"I went to this place on my girlfriend's birthday, and it was spectacular. I would have to say this was one of the best restaurant experiences I've ever had. Everything about it was great. Being able to see all of Downtown Phoenix at a glance perfectly complimented the stunning barrage of amazing food. Our server was exceptional as well, her name was Lindsey. The food was absolutely delicious, it was probably the greatest meal I've had in my life. The sirloin steak I order was cooked to perfection as were my green beans and macaroni. Each bite lead to ecstasy absorbed by my exuberant taste buds. I was in a state of awe. The desert was really good too, I got creme brule, and I only liked the chocolate one, but it was still really good. It was a bit on the expensive side but it was well worth the money. 5 stars no doubt."}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant the 3 stars mostly for the experience and the service. The food is good, but unless you are a big steak eater, the options are very limited. My daughter and I went there while staying at the Hyatt and being vegetarians, are options were extremely limited...and by that I mean we literally ate lettuce! Yes the grilled romaine was tasty, but hardly a meal. My daughter had a side of the risotto and  quite liked that. I would love to see places like this offer some great vegetarian options on par with their meat menu. It really is disappointing.   Bottom line; if you are staying at the Hyatt, order room service, which is great, and then go up to the Compass for drinks and the experience."}
{"text":"The views are certainly worth the trip, but I'm not sure the prices are warranted. The corn bread was delicious as was the appetizer, one of the flatbreads. I had the eggplant cannelloni for my entree. It was good, but actually was filled with too much goat cheese. I might come again for dessert, but I likely wouldn't spend the money for the full meal."}
{"text":"If you come here, I would probably suggest only coming if you plan on getting one of their more pricey items like a steak. Otherwise, go elsewhere for a burger. My girlfriend and I are simple foodies, but wanted to come more the experience itself. My burger smelled funny and didn't really hit the spot for $20. But like I said I'm more into just simple food. What breaks it for me was the service. Waitress came to the table and said nothing. And then couldn't politely answer my question about beverages because they are no where on the menu, and then came later to take our order and then went off on a seafood dish out of nowhere. Also, I made reservations a day before and got there and still had to wait. How does that make sense?"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice but to be honest, the waitress seemed pretty annoyed when I asked about the reverse happy hour special. Besides her, very relaxing and different."}
{"text":"Good restaurant. The highlight is the rotating dining area. Food was pretty good, service was alright. I had the fillet mignon and ended up getting violently ill a few hours later. These things happen, and of course it wasn't intentional, but getting food poisoning from a $150 meal isn't quite what I was looking to take away from our anniversary dinner."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews about poor food quality and a woman getting dizzy, my husband and I decided to take a chance and just go for the experience.  I am so glad we did!  We wanted a special place to celebrate our 21st wedding anniversary, and we found it!  We were first greeted by a very kind hostess and seated quickly- we had reservations, yet it seemed to be a slow night and it looked as though they were not needed.  We had a fantastic server Julian who saw to our every need and seemed to know how to come by at just the right moment without interrupting our conversation.  He patiently explained how the filet mignon was prepared- and it was delicious!  My husband had the flat iron steak that he thought was fantastic, however in all fairness the green beans were a tad bit undercooked.  There was a sweet lady that kept our glasses full!  The meal was brought to a perfect finish when Julian brought us a complimentary dessert with a cool chocolate sign that said \"Happy Anniversary!\"   As a side note: I have real issues with dizziness and I am happy to report that because the rotation is so slow I did not have any problems!  I am looking forward to coming back to this extraordinary place to celebrate more special occasions!"}
{"text":"The only thing this place has going for it is the view-which is great. However, food is subpar. Wine glasses are more expensive than Donovan's or Flemings. Service was S-L-O-W on all accounts."}
{"text":"If You have all the time in the world You should come here and see beautiful Phoenix, but apart from the view service is rude, we waited for appetizers for for 30min. And for soup one hour, on Tuesday evening. So we just had to skip entry because by the time they got here we where full of bread."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner. More variety on the menu wouldn't hurt though."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The food was excellent, the service was great, and the view was to die for. We got there about an hour before sunset; it takes about an hour to completely go around. It was very romantic ... perfect for my other half's birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"Staff was awesome. Karla and Brittney were attentive without being overbearing.   Atmosphere was top notch as always. The seating at the window is cozy and great for date night. It does appear that the dress code has been relaxed. I preferred it in years past when people dressed up to go to dinner here. Our last visit ad the place loaded with people in camouflage  hoodies and john deer hats.   Food was disappointing. The Calamari was awesome but the Sea Bass and Scallops were disappointing.  Something has changed because I use to really like the sea food here. The Sea Bass was tough,dry and over cooked. You should not have to use a knife to eat fish. I ended up pulling the skin off because it was so tough.   We've decided that in the future we would just sit in the lounge area and have drinks and appetizers instead of a full meal.   I did not realize the name had been changed but it appears that they are striving for Grill  style food instead of the fine dinning it use to be. Tell the chef to keep it simple."}
{"text":"Great ambience, great service and great view! The calamari was excellent but our steaks were over cooked and dry. I would go again for drinks and the view but not for a main course."}
{"text":"Remarkably exceptional customer service!!! Firstly, my boyfriend made Valentine's Day dinner reservations for us at 9:00, we arrived early at 8:35 and were ready to wait the 25 minutes to be seated but it didn't take any longer than 10 to get our table, which was very nice.   We sit down and get a menu with a preset 4 course meal for Valentine's Day that we weren't aware of before making the reservations, and at $80 a person for the 4 course meal when we only intended on each getting a $20-$30 entree, we both almost had a heart attack. We asked our waiter if it was possible to only order the entree, and he returned politely and apologetically saying since it was all preset we couldn't. We then asked to speak to the manager, and after explaining to him that we're just 18 years old and weren't expecting to order anything over $30 the manager replied saying that it was their fault, that they should have called us after making the reservation to tell us about the preset menu, then he told us not to worry about it, it was all on him. Both my boyfriend and I tried explaining to him that that wasn't necessary at all and we would be completely fine with just paying for an entree and the manager was exceptionally nice enough to tell us even though it's not necessary he wanted to take care of the entire 4 course meal for each of us, on the house.   I would have never in a million years expect such a high class restaurant to have employees and managers with so much respect for mere 18 year olds, I was absolutely blown away by the level of customer service at this establishment, it's unlike anywhere else. Our experience here at the Compass Grill was genuinely one I will never forget, it's absolutely amazing.   Besides the inspiring customer service, the food was great and the view is beautiful, they were able to accommodate my vegetarianism by turning each of the 4 courses vegetarian, which was very much appreciated and unexpected, and my boyfriend loved the meat dishes he got with smoked duck empanada and his main course filet.   We've been raving about this place to everyone ever since our Valentine's Day experience and we will definitely return, maybe for graduation dinner or an anniversary. I wish I could give this place 10 out of 5 stars, I'd recommend it to anyone. Thank you so much for your generosity, Compass Grill!"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoy this place..The view is incredible if you are staying downtown to catch a game stay at the Hyatt the restaurant is on top of the building btw it moves 360 so you can see all of Phoenix. I suggest you make a reservation for around 7pm so you can see the sun go down.  The food is good but don't order anything that is seafood it more of a steak restaurant..I did not enjoy any of the seafood..sorry just being honest I am a seafood lover and lived in places that serve fresh seafood but we are talking about AZ no Oceans...lol. However, the steak and desserts are fantastic. BTW for you Military members the hotel offers a Military discount on rooms which are very reasonable prices  since you are staying downtown. BTW lots of things to do downtown games, concerts, clubs, opera, and bars all in walking distance..reminds me of downtown Seattle..a little..."}
{"text":"Came for our 5th anniversary. This place is lovely! The staff is friendly and the service is great. The salmon was amazing!!! I would love to come here again. Dress up. This is not a jeans and t-shirt kind of place. Sunset is a beautiful time to come. The restaurant makes a full rotation in an hour so you get to see the whole view from the top of the building. What an amazing idea!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Service was great,  food was satisfying,  and the view was spectacular.  This place is definitely the place to be. I was so blown away by how the restaurant moves while u dine so that you can see the view of Phoenix while we eat. If you make a reservation at 5:30 be ware, the elevator doesn't take you up to the 24th floor until they actually open up which is at 5:30, so don't go early because you will be stuck waiting in a line just t go up. Other than that,  I highly recommend thid place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary dinner and the experience was terrible. We had reservations at 6:30 and it took us 10 minutes of standing around before someone brought us to our seats.  We sat down and was asked what we would like to drink. We answered and then looked at the menu for literally 30 seconds and the server comes and ask us if we're ready to order. We say no, but can you come back in a bit. He then comes back 20 MINUTES later and rudely ask \"what are you going to order\"  Not only was it that, but i ordered the pork loin and oh my wow. I have never in my life asked for another dish before. I did for this. It was so terrible. I know what Fine Dinning is, and trust me, this isnt. My boyfriend couldnt eat it either and then we both had beef medallion, which was ONLY acceptable, not worth 37 dollars.  Terrible food terrible service. I appreciated what my boyfriend tried to do, but if you're trying to take someone to a special dinner, this place isnt it. it IS NOT worth that much money to go to this place.  All in all, terrible service terriple food"}
{"text":"Recently had a dinner here and it was amazing!! We arrived 30 min early hoping to get a drink at the bar, however there was a private group going on. So we headed downstairs to the main hotel for a drink but as our elevator arrived the hostess found a table she could seat us at! That was perfect!!  There were a few hiccups that happened but they fixed it. We had brie fondue, pork belly tostada. filet with a side of charred Brussels sprouts veggie ratatouille  and strawberry shortcake with basil ice cream  everything was prepared how we asked for it. I was a bit nauseous at first in the restaurant but after 5 min i was fine. great dinner. casual for clothes."}
{"text":"We came here for a business dinner. The ambiance is fantastic as a rotating restaurant and you can see why it would be very popular for couples on dates etc. The service and recommendations are spot on but that's all the good things about this place The food was very averaged and over priced . You are paying for the view. We had the charcuterie platter, calamari lobster bisque as  starters . All bland and not above average. My entree was mixed grill platter with lamb, scallops and seasonal vegetables . It was over cooked and under-season . For the price range there are much better places downtown"}
{"text":"This restaurant is great with a magnificent view! The food was yummy & the wait staff was attentive without smothering. It's a cool place to bring family and friends who live in the area, and for those visiting from far away places. Give it a try. I think you'll love it!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I celebrated our anniversary here. The reviews are pretty spot on. You pay for the view. We ordered everything! Apps soup drinks and main entree. I was pretty shocked that they didn't offer a free dessert for it being our anniversary because the waitress was aware of that. Most places appreciate you celebrating a special occasion and Atleast have dessert be on the house. The service was slow at times. I got a steak with mashed potatoes. I can say that the steak was good but the mashed potatoes sucked. A few tips... Once there is no more sunlight outside the place gets soooo cold!! Definitely bring a jacket. I slightly got nausea from the restaurant constantly moving also. Try to sit with the motion not against it. It was great for a view. Food and service was nothing special."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre and is overpriced. They give out very small portions and the wait was very long. The fish is very dry and tasteless. The steaks had no flavor. The only reason to come here is the view, the food needs some improvement."}
{"text":"We went to Compass for my birthday dinner last night and will not be returning again.  My fiance told me after our disappointing dinner that he had called earlier in the day to confirm our reservation and notified them that it was my birthday.  He was told that they would greet me with a \"Happy Birthday\" at the door and then they would bring out a banner and candles with dessert. He told them that would be great because he knows I love surprises...  We showed up and gave the hostess the name on the reservation, but there was no birthday greeting.  That was fine with me because I wasn't expecting it.  Then, when we got to the table the hostess asked if we were celebrating anything, and we told her it was my birthday.  The waiter came by a moment later and also asked if we were celebrating anything, and once again we told him it was my birthday. Despite having asked about it, neither really acknowledged it.  It was like they were just reading from their script, but not listening to the answers.   The service was awkward from the very beginning - the waiter stood there waiting for our drink orders while we clearly were not ready (we were both trying to look at one wine list and passing it back and forth across the table), and then finally asked if we needed another moment.  We ended up ordering cocktails, and my pomegranate margarita was not good - it tasted heavily of sour mix.  I drank less than a third of it and decided it wasn't worth the calories.   I ordered the scallops for dinner and my fiance ordered the salmon.  Both were decent but unremarkable. The service remained awkward throughout dinner.  We were pretty full when it came time for dessert, so we decided to split the goat cheese cheesecake.  Once again, decent but unremarkable.  The disappointing part was that they didn't even put a candle in the dessert or decorate the plate or anything - so much for birthday pictures. And I didn't know to expect the banner, but my fiance was disappointed that they had told him about it but didn't follow through - he was really looking forward to surprising me.   This brings me to the worst part.  We spent over $100 on dinner - we had ordered salads, entrees, dessert, and drinks - and not only did they not really acknowledge that we were celebrating my birthday, they didn't even comp my dessert! This is the first restaurant I've ever been to that didn't do SOMETHING to acknowledge a birthday - whether it be a candle, special plate decoration, or at least free dessert.     Bottom line - the view was pretty, the food was mediocre, and the service was terrible.  So disappointing!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here for our six month dating anniversary! The views were amazing! And the food was very good! Our server, Jacob, was very attentive and took great care of us. Overall an amazing experience at Compass!"}
{"text":"Perhaps it was an off night for the kitchen. The cocktail, Phoenix Flirt, was weak/tasteless, the cornbread was cold and dry, butter for the cornbread was frozen. The presentation of the brie appetizer could have been a bit more than smeared sauce around the brie and a serrated knife would have worked much better than a bread knife. The wedge salad was good as was the mahi special. The dessert was complimentary due to the wait time for the food. The restaurant has good ratings so our experience was a bit of a surprise and disappointment."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this place in over 15 years and still  a great place to wine and dine a date, would definitely be going back. Their macaroni and cheese with bacon was very good. Love the fact that the place spins around while you eat very classy. Get ready to spend at least $100 for two, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Would have given them 5-stars (wonderful food and amazing views of the Valley) but we were seated next to a large and very loud group which didn't make for a very romantic experience. We explained to the hostess (and in our reservation) that my husband and I were there for our 1-year wedding anniversary. I thought that they could have placed us somewhere quieter, especially since they were barely half full upon arrival."}
{"text":"This was a GREAT PLACE to eat, fun  friendly and very entertaining with out tv, the city and food was really good. Everyone should try this place at least once for fun."}
{"text":"Being on the 24th floor on a cloudy rainy night only added to the wonderful ambience and the food was very tasty and the service cheerful and speedy."}
{"text":"Beautiful view - great service -- food was decent."}
{"text":"Beautiful view great service awesome food what more can I say."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars.  The service was excellent and the view of Pheonix at sunset was nice.  I ate the wedge salad (nothing special) and the chorizo mac and cheese (yummy).  The highlight for me was the pudding trio, the honey date flan was delicious but the portion was small...which led me to savor every bite.  The other people in my party were satisfied with their food and there were no complaints."}
{"text":"Just went for an early Valentines dinner, the place is amazing! The service was great, we had two servers so every request was met. The food is really good, but it's the only reason I didn't give 5 stars. The food is a bit pricy, but you're paying for the experience. The wine list is great, and reasonably priced. The best part, by far is being able to see the birds eye view of Phoenix, Awesome!"}
{"text":"Avoid!  This place has lost its verve.  It still has a great view!  However,  the service is sluggish.  The scallops and panchetta sounded good to me.  Big mistake!  Sauce was butter plus mccormick scallop seasoning.  Scallops were not fresh, although i did eat later in the evening.  Basically a big AVOID!"}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, amazing. The views are one of a kind, the food is delicious and the service is exceptional. Your wallet will feel it later, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Great food, great views, and a wonderful way to have a Valentines Day dinner! My wife and I will definitely go back.   The only minor issue was our waitress was on the uppity/condescending  side and not all that friendly. Her assistant was very good, however.  After the meal I realized WHY our waitress had an attitude.....a tip of 18% was automatically added to the bill!!    Based on her service, I was thinking more on the lines of 10%-12%. I considered raising this issue, but didn't want to ruin our Valentines Day evening....so I begrudgingly paid it. Hopefully we'll get a friendlier waitress/waiter next time, or better yet....they will change their policy to let the customer decide what the tip should be! I think the waitress/waiter attitude would be drastically different if it were a customer determined tip."}
{"text":"The experience was great! Dinner for two in a restaurant that provides more than the basics. The staff was excellent. The food very tasty and just enough to leave room for a delicious desert.  Pricing was good for the scenic and unconventional restaurant experience.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was great. View was great. We had a really nice experience here. It was worth the drive downtown."}
{"text":"My husband made reservations for The Compass AZ Grill for our Anniversary dinner.  He planned it so we were sitting just as the sun was going down and the city looked beautiful.  The staff was friendly and our server was top notch.  I had a cocktail called the Compass Pop which was deelish!  I had the Herb Crusted Salmon which was cooked to perfection and my husband enjoyed his Filet Mignon thoroughly.  Our server asked if there was a special occasion we were there for and bought our anniversary dessert for us which was an amazing brûlée banana cannoli dish.  It was a unique, lovely and romantic evening and a place I would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Great View! Over Priced! Over Rated! Don't waste your money! Food was blah! Try one of the MANY great places to eat at street level in downtown."}
{"text":"A very good resturant for romantic dinner, Food was not as good but It has very good view. Straff is very friendly. They messed up in my Food but they did consider that and took care my bill."}
{"text":"I can't usually afford to eat at fancy places like this, but my boyfriend was celebrating a milestone birthday and I wanted to treat him. We had been wanting to come here for a long time, mostly because we love the Simpsons and Springfield has a rotating restaurant. \"Food tastes better when it's revolving,\" as Seymour Skinner once said. Plus, when we first started dating, we went on a walk around the city that ended up with us taking the elevator to the Compass and the staff kindly let us admire the view even though we weren't paying customers.  Anyway, being treated kindly by the staff and the novelty of it made it an obvious choice for a special dinner. And we weren't disappointed! Another thing, we are vegetarians and my man is lactose intolerant, and they definitely went out of their way to accommodate our dietary needs. They gave him special dairy-free bread, specially prepared his entree without cheese, and even treated us to free lemon sorbet after the meal as there wasn't anything without dairy on the regular menu! They did a great job of making us feel at home.  While we don't usually pay $25 for an entree, this was definitely worth it as an indulgence and we would love to come back for other special occasions.  The only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars is that the decor could stand to be updated, and (this is not the restaurant's fault in the slightest) Phoenix's skyline is 3 stars at best, even at sunset. Be prepared to see a lot of dirty rooftops and air conditioners. It's still fun though."}
{"text":"This was quite the experience! We came at sunset and the view was incredible! The food was delicious. I could eat the green chili cornbread every day of my life! The wedge , filet and Mac and cheese are the way to go! Jerry was our server and she was wonderful. She was kind and helpful, and made the night truly amazing. People like her make you want to come back and enjoy another great dining experience at a restaurant. Thank you Jerry for making us feel special and taken care of, you're awesome!"}
{"text":"Honestly? Service was crap. Food was okay though we only had desserts. Drinks were a bit pricy for the quality but also good. They said they'd call our room when our table was ready and didn't. Then made excuses. Then gave us the slowest service ever.   But yes, the view was great."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Drove down from Las Vegas for a birthday celebration and the service we received while dining here was very disappointing. Our waitress was very slow, non approachable, and there were two other couples that complained about their service as well. We asked for our steak medium and it came out 40 minutes later and was medium well done. The atmosphere was the highlight of the evening as it revolves 360 around Phoenix. There is also a 15 Valet fee you have to pay. We paid 85 for a steak, vegetables, and mashed potatoes. My salad wasn't very tasty so skipped out on that."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Hyatt during a recent business trip and myself along with 6 others in our group decided we'd splurge one night and go to the 24th floor and eat at the Compass.  Big mistake IMHO!  Our server never smiled, and acted like he was doing our table a favor.  If that wasn't bad enough, I ordered the Truffled Mushroom Bolognese which was dry as a bone; while the mushrooms did have a nice flavor, the pasta itself was dry and flavorless. The views were very nice as we were there at 7pm which gave us a great sunset view.  When the view is all I can say was good... well, I won't eat here again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for our 23rd Anniversary.  I have always wanted to go and while the views were amazing, the service was not great and the food only good.  I expected exceptional food and service.  It was a Sunday night and the place wasn't packed by any means.  It took the waiter 10 minutes just to take a drink order which was when we placed our full order.  While the drinks and appetizer were promptly delivered, our meals took another 50 minutes to show up.  I had the fish, which was a stripped bass, but was served with some kind of cheese sauce, which I don't care for on my fish.  It was a great place to go for the experience, but I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Food was excellent!  Bacon Bleu Mac & Cheese was my favorite part of dinner.  It was a bit noisy but otherwise good atmosphere.  Wish it was open for lunch so you could see the sites in the daylight!"}
{"text":"A++++ GREAT experience. My expectations have been exceeded. Expected a touristy experience with low expectations for the food. All five of us were very pleased. Steak was my plan but based on the waiters I had the pork chop. Truly the best I have ever had. The Brussel sprouts were amazing and the view doesn't get any better.   HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"}
{"text":"The views were beautiful, the atmosphere nice; however, the food and drinks did not meet expectations."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go! Love the view, it's much, MUCH better than Orange Sky! Service rocks and every table has a view to die for... Unlike Orange Sky! We highly recommend The Compass Arizona Grill and will be back! The food was amazing! And lots of it!"}
{"text":"This is an unfortunate score I have to give and it has nothing to do with ambience or service.  In fact, those two things were fantastic and amazing and prevented me from leaving more disappointed than I would have left had the ambience and service been mediocre.  I was beyond disappointed in the cuisine.  Not only was a bulk of the food luke warm, but items such as the brusell sprouts lacked flavor and other items like the chicken were and risotto were overpowered by mismatched mole sauces and a salad with huge figs that were not at all appetizing.  It was probably the least successful sweet/savory pairing I have ever tasted.  When you go to a place like this and you are spending $25 at minimum a plate it's not about portion size, it's about taste.  If I can't even make it through the meal even when I'm starving, that is a problem.  I would suggest they go back to the drawing board with the food.  I have had better cuisine at my local Culinary Dropout...and they \"dropped out\" of culinary school."}
{"text":"They must sell this place for the view. Long wait to be seated. Shoddy service. The food was unbelievably poor. The view, however is really nice. And the wine was good."}
{"text":"I really like the Compass Grill. It is a great way to see the Valley and enjoy a good meal. I am never completely wowed by the food but it is solid and a we leave satisfied and happy. We all enjoyed the appetizers; a flatbread, charcuterie board and the fondue. My pork loin was slightly dry, but the S/O short rib was to die for. Auntie loved her salmon and thought it may have been the best she ever had. We thought the service was particularly excellent.  The Compass Grill is a great place to take visitors, it is romantic and definitely on our A tour. We like to go at sunset to take advantage of all the various lighting and views while we dine."}
{"text":"We celebrated our 40th anniversary here and the service was exceptional! The food was delicious and beautiful! Thanks for all the special attention!"}
{"text":"Yes, the food is expensive. But, portions are decent.  Good flavour. We ordered the chicken & the salmon. Service was very good. The View was awesome.  I Made a reservation to get a glimpse of the sun set.  So, that made it perfect.  Will surely go again."}
{"text":"Can't beat these views! The food was pricey but you pay for quality food and the atmosphere. Seemed like the clientele varied from people who are clearly accustomed to nicer dining establishments (well-dressed, quiet conversation, polite table manners) and people who don't know how to behave in classy dining establishments (drunken table near us seemed to think they were at a bar/club, and several other tables contained guests in athletic wear, shorts, and/or flip-flops). Waitstaff was professional and formal. Portions were larger than what you usually see at this level of dining."}
{"text":"the Compass has a unique experience. the rotating dining area lets you view Downtown like you've never seen it before and sometimes you didn't even notice you were moving. making reservations was very easy through their online website. the whole 24th floor was very clean and classy. the hostess and servers were very friendly and prompt.   the drinks and food were made perfectly. i ordered a cocktail and an 8oz steak, presentation and flavor were all there. i would definitely recommend anyone who wants to dine here to make reservations for around sun set. you'll be able to experience the view from daylight to night life."}
{"text":"Very disappointing for the price you pay. Service was very slow. Drinks took forever to come. Scallops were underwhelming at best. Mac and cheese was over cooked but had good flavor. Rest of the food was good.  Been there done that. Would not go back again. Much better out there for the same price!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my friend's birthday tonight at Compass! Everyone greeted us with big smiles and Happy Birthday wishes, a great start to an amazing dinner. YUM in every respect. Loved our server, Anthony, who took great care of us... seamless, effortless service.  Understated elegance! Incredible views of Phoenix. Downtown Phoenix just keeps getting better every year. Was fun to stroll around the downtown area after our dinner."}
{"text":"This is a rotating restaurant! We didn't order any food here, but just came for the late night happy hour. I got the whiskey ginger (one of the more popular drinks in grad school), and was actually surprised to hear that they had ginger beer. The views were great, the ambience of candles and city lights. It felt like a completely different atmosphere from our hotel room just a few floors below, stepping out of those elevator doors and feeling like Cinderella being escorted across the red carpet"}
{"text":"Exceptional view, excellent service, great quality and good value for the location."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of visiting the Compass Room for their Christmas Buffet this past holiday season. New in town and hungry for a good meal, I was eager to briefly forget (or at least stifle) the age old family traditions currently unavailable to me, and paid $60 for a ticket to their All You Can Eat. And boy did I.  The Compass Room is located in the Hyatt Regency in downtown Phoenix. There is parking in the large parking garage across the street, or you can pull up for valet, if your occasion calls for it. Upon entering the hotel, you are greeted by a huge foyer, ornately decorated with interesting sculptures and paintings. You walk straight toward the back of the foyer to the elevators, slightly rounding a corner to the right. A desk comes into view and the attendants will ask you where you're heading. Inform them that you are going to the Compass Room, they verify your reservations, and you enter the looming elevator. You are whisked away, many, many, many floors up to the looming space ship-shaped restaurant that overlooks much of phoenix. The restaurant is as expected, nicely decorated and fancy, if you're into that scene. The window views are exceptional, providing some of the best Phoenix city views available. And the restaurant spins around 360 degrees, which, let's admit, is really frickin' cool.   Our experience was unique, in that we were there for the Christmas buffet, or do they call it the Holiday buffet now? But I am assuming that the overall experience is quite similar no matter the time. Skipping ahead to what we all want to hear about... the food. Now, I am a chef, no stranger to good food. But I'll tell ya, they got it right for buffet. After selecting a few good wines, my companion and I lurched from our seats (ok, we did it slowly... maybe too slow, to compensate for how fast we actually WANTED to move) and walked over to the first station of food. I loaded my first plate with the following items: A delicious mushroom risotto, freshly baked bread and an assortment of fancy cheeses (perhaps 7 different kinds), the ever-amazing combination of fresh mozzarella, tomatoes and basil. The next plate got to the heart of the issue, which was a healthy portion of rosemary crusted beef tenderloin and a nice side of gravy and some excellent mashed potatoes. I took a smaller portion of ham, but admittedly was not as impressive as I had hoped. The tenderloin however, as well as the entire first plate, were simply fantastic. Fantastic enough for me to leave my seat, belt loosened, tie aside and collect a second portion of each. For dessert, they had carrot cake which was delicious, as I am a big carrot cake fan as well as a large assortment of other items. The chocolate cake was excellent as well.  The bottom line for my visit to the Compass Room, is that it was near perfect in almost every way. I will remember some of the dishes I had there for many, many years to come and I will definitely be back, if not even for the food, but the great panoramic city view."}
{"text":"Awesome place, especially for a romantic occasion! My boyfriend and I went there last night for our anniversary and loved it, we were there when the sun was setting and also when it went down and it was absolutely breathtaking! We wanted an order of the scallops but they didn't have them, so we will try it next time! We did get the bacon burger as well as beef and it was awesome! We loved our server Jerry, she made it even better! We will be back soon! It's awesome!"}
{"text":"This was one of the coolest restaurants I have been to. The service was good, very friendly, and super clean. The wait time for the food was the perfect timing, not too long and not right away, good cocktail drinks. Amazing view of Phoenix with a 360 spin!! It's a bit pricey but worth the money!"}
{"text":"We recently had dinner at the Compass Grill and was extremely disappointed. The views were beautiful, but the service we received from our waiter was very disappointing . He took about 15 mins to greet us. On top of that the meal we ordered for dinner was cold and not tasteful at all. I will say the young \"secondary\" waiter was extremely attentive constantly filling our waters and cleaning our plates. Over all, a very disappointing experience and won't be returning."}
{"text":"My husband and I have come here a few times for dinner and sometimes just for drinks and a desert. When coming for dinner, we always make reservations on open table.com. We get seated within a couple of minutes. The view is absolutely amazing, we try to get there just as the sun is setting and it's beautiful everytime. The service is great, the waiters are knowledgable, friendly and very attentive. When ordering appetizers, you're paying for quality not quantity. They're delicious, but they're small portions, a great starter dish but not enough to share. If you want to start off with something, I highly suggest the compass bisque. It is packed with flavor and the most delicious bisque we've ever had. Another highlight of the Compass is the chili cornbread. I can eat that as a meal by itself, it is so good. It is also served with the honey butter and makes a perfect pair.  My husband typically order the filet mignon and he can't stop talking about how tender and delicious the meat is. He is incredibly picky about meat, but the Compass serves up a high quality peice of meat. I typically get the fish of the day, and as always it's flavorful and very fresh. I like it now how you are able to choose the sides you want. Everything from the mac n' cheese, to the garlic mash is just delicious. When there's still room, you can't leave the Compass without trying one of their desserts. We've tried the strawberry shortcake which was incredibly moist and rich, the creme brulee was to die for, and the southwest tiramisu was heavenly. They have a satisfactory wine list, it provides a variety for both the red and white drinkers.  When choosing the Compass, keep in mind both things. You're paying for the quality of food and the amazing view. This is considered by us to be a special occassion kind of place. Don't expect to walk out with a $50 bill. Everything about this place is awesome, whether you're going for dinner or simply drinks and a view. Also, if you're considering drinks and apps, try going during a monsoon, it's unbelievable!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant's manager, Marcie, asked our client's daughter to leave because she took a tiny sip of her mother's wine and Marcie did it in an extremely rude, unprofessional manner that was 100% uncalled for and unnecessary. I would never recommend this restaurant if you or your clients want to actually be treated with respect. Marcie was extremely threatening and should NOT be working in the hospitality industry. She also told our client that her daughter had better not go into the other hotel venues and they would be watching her. This is unacceptable behavior. Our waitresses (Lindsey and one other woman) were very nice however. Yay on the food and waitresses but screw the management. And this is a party of 15 they treated like this; they must not want business."}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday dinner on a Friday night.  You can be placed in two possible locations:  1.  Right at the window, where you have a great view of the entire city 2.  Just inside of that first row, where you're staring at the people by the window  Of course, you hope you land the row by the window, otherwise it defeats the point of coming to Compass.  Make sure to request a window table if you make a reservation in advance.  The steak was excellent.  The salmon was so-so.    Definitely a cool place to go once for a birthday, anniversary, etc.  But now somewhere you would go on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I came with my significant other for a special evening and great food (especially considering the price). What we got was mediocre service and underwhelming meals. While the view certainly is 5 stars, the same can't be said for the rest of the experience. We ordered the sea food pasta and a chicken sandwich. The seafood pasta was astringent tasting, and the chicken was bland and lifeless. The bread was the only redeeming quality.   Honestly, you'd be better off hiking up a mountain for comparable views and bringing a picnic with you than wasting your time and money at The Compass."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Great views of the city. Service was excellent. Food was very good and unrushed. I'll definitely be going back in the future. A wonderful place to bring friends or family that are in town to visit"}
{"text":"Good Experience.Food was good and ambience also very good.We are vegetarian and they have good vegetarian option also."}
{"text":"What it lacks in certain food items it quickly makes up in cocktails and a great wine list. It's obvious why some still enjoy this place..... The view never disappoints and it adds to the ambience. I wouldn't recommend it for a family but if the kids have to go they will be amazed at how cool the city looks. Best time to go is late happy hour to enjoy a beverage and the Phoenix city lights."}
{"text":"My husband and I try to come once or twice a year, since I'm always wanting to try new places. So often, we go here for my bday or his. This place is always good and the service is phenomenal. However, the last time we were there we had the lamb and my oh my, we were not a fan of how they made it. Either that or I may just not like lamb in general. I instantly had to spit the piece o had in my mouth out because the texture and the scent was too strong. Other foods have always been good but just not the lamb!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to hang out and have a classy evening. The food is decent albeit pricey but its wonderful to spin above the city and see all the sights... While sitting in fancy clothes sipping manhattans and Martinis."}
{"text":"We went here for their Easter brunch and enjoyed our meal, the view at this place is awesome and the staff are up to par for a hyatt. Wish I can say it's anything more, but the service and cost for the complimentary champagne  Is A-Okay"}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent. Great way to view the city and enjoy a nice meal. There is a slight jerkiness to the rotation of the restaurant. It's not perfectly smooth, which was a little dizzying at first, but you get used to it quickly and forget about it. Definitely would go back. Make a reservation for sunset. Beautiful."}
{"text":"Second time here and we had an outstanding evening. Food was wonderful and service was amazing. Anthony was a great waiter."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best.  Service we decent.  Views and experience made it all worth it."}
{"text":"Great dining experience and excellent table service. My fiancee and i loved the view!"}
{"text":"Seamless experience, had no problem getting a time and the staff received my reservation with no problems"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our one year anniversary. They bring you bread and cornbread with butter before your meal. It's good. Not the best ever, but good. The crust is hard on the bread, but the middle is warm and soft. Some people don't like the hard outside, but I thought it was okay. I ordered the chicken and my husband ordered the steak. Very, very small portions. He was still hungry so we ordered more bread AND I shared my chicken with him (which was also a very, very small portion) to help fill him up. He did say the streak was DELICIOUS and perfectly tender (his steak was prepared medium), but the portion was much smaller than the size of his fist. The \"sides\" that they come with are not big either so don't show up starving, unless you plan on getting lots of appetizers before dinner. Overall, decent, but there are lots of restaurants that have better food and bigger portions for much, much less money, but probably not the same view and ambiance."}
{"text":"So view wonderful, staff nice. I ordered a lemon drop martini and they made it with sierra mist, yes a soft drink, gag! The food was unremarkable and just OK, nothing that I can remember in fact. So many other good res. in Phoenix , skip this one."}
{"text":"Way overpriced for the food they have to offer.  Another fairly interesting location brought down by an over-priced, under-whelming menu.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Awesome view and great wine list. I had the duck and wasn't blown away but my wife's steak was very good. Overall I recommend the restaurant. After eating we took the bike cabs for a ride around town."}
{"text":"Amazing service and delicious dinner! View made it all the more delightful! Going back again soon!"}
{"text":"Our office (18 people) went for our Christmas dinner.  The service was great....which we found out was because they thought we had to \"get out fast to go see the Nutcracker\".  We never mentioned anything about the Nutcracker, but it got us good service.  We had to order more than a week in advance.  They put us at 2 tables back to back so we couldn't socialize.  There was a little sunken area next to us that was never used the entire time we were there.  They said it couldn't hold all of us but I call bull.  They could've rearranged the tables to make it work.  It was very loud and very pricey. The drinks especially, were really expensive.  My husband liked the lamb, but my salmon was overcooked and the sides were bizzare. We all agreed that it was not worth the price and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Hubby brought me for dinner and drinks sometime back.  This is a great experience for a romantic date and worth the splurge. We had great seats, service, and food.  Hubby ordered the duck and liked it.  We had dessert and drinks too.   All was great and the ambiance was comfortable and romantic!"}
{"text":"Nice waitstaff, small food portions. So so food. Kitchen took a long time even though it was quiet when we were there. Nice sports bar \"ish\" atmosphere. We sat at the bar, which usually means food comes fast,  but no in this case. They do have a little patio."}
{"text":"Beautiful views. Great place in a dated hotel. Steak medallions were excellent. Great for special occasions or some pricy cocktails to celebrate. The black and white dessert is excellent."}
{"text":"Great food and a wonderful atmosphere! I was truly amazed at the amount of gluten free options on the menu. My wife and I had the blue masa calamari which was wonderful. The main course was also a home run! I had the lamb shank and my wife had the pumpkin risotto. Both meals were excellent! My wife is gluten free so finding a restaurant that makes good food like this with that in mind was a truly good find."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try compass out and finally did. Picked a bad night -it was comicon weekend and the Hyatt was extremely crowded. Made my reservation same day for 8pm.  Was seated at a table away from the rotating Windows.  My boyfriend asked the server on two different occasions if we could get a window seat when the parties left and were told no both times.  Our seating just seemed awkward as we sat facing a couple who sat at the window. Had to look around them to enjoy the view.  Food - For appetizer we ordered the Brie fondue Tasted like velveta cheese and the same bread that you get when you first get seated is served with it. We split the filet it was tasty , portion was on the smaller side but was cooked perfect  Service was slow which would be good however the server hardly came around and when my cocktail drink was emptied she never asked if I wanted another.  Go for a drink or during the reverse happy hour (9-11pm)"}
{"text":"Went with my husband for our 16th wedding anniversary. We made mention that it was a special anniversary dinner when we made the reservation and were greeted at the host station and by our server with \"Happy Anniversary\" comments.   When we were seated our server stated that dessert was complimentary in celebration of our special occasion. The cheese and charcuterie board was good but the Caesar salad was a bit sub par, croutons were rock hard and there was too much lemon in the dressing. I had the zucchini corn chowder soup and it was delicious. My husband ordered the chicken sandwich and found it to be perfectly cooked and enjoyed the fact that it was free range and locally sourced.   The view was amazing, especially at night, and our server was fantastic! I'm deducting one star due to the salad, but specifically for the poor selection of IPA (only one and not local). Other than that, it was a wonderful anniversary dinner and definitely worth a trip to Compass Arizona Grill."}
{"text":"Scenary was breath taking but I expected more from the food especially for the price.... Very limited selection from the menu as well...."}
{"text":"The view ALONE bumps this to a 4 star.  I have lived in the Valley for over 10 years and I FINALLY visited the Compass Restaurant. A spectacular view of the city at sunset couldn't have been more perfect.  The food was really good, although I can't rave about it, because we have so many other great restaurants that I believe are much better for the price. However, I realize the view is really what you're paying for. There was a special eggplant bisque that was definitely worth mentioning though!!  A great place to take SPECIAL guests or a lucky date who might enjoy watching the sunset over the mountains and an endless sea of city lights."}
{"text":"The food was awesome.  The ambiance was great. The setting was romantic.  The service left much to be desired.   I made a reservation 24 hours prior to arriving with my date.  At time of reservation I let the restaurant know it was Heather's birthday and I asked if they could set the table with flowers.  At the time I was told it was no problem.  On the way to dinner, traffic was heavy so I called to inform the restaurant we'd be a few minutes behind.  I was told it was no problem and our table would still be there for us.  It was at that time I was told that they wouldn't be able to do flowers as they need to be purchased ahead of time.  (This could have been communicated to me when making the reservation).     We arrived 5 minutes after our reserved time and checked in.  We then waited 10 minutes or so before being seated (assuming our table had been given to others or not prepared yet).  Once seated we were in a section with several empty tables which left us confused as to why we waited in the lobby for these tables?   (I'd rather wait at an empty table with a view than the small lobby by the elevators, especially near sunset).     Upon checking in the hostess asked if there was a special occasion.   I told her it was Heather's birthday... which was actually written on the reservation card that I could see on the desk.  Someone else seated us and asked if it was a special occasion, I told her it was Heather's birthday.    Our first server came up to fill our waters and asked if it was a special occasion, and I told them it was Heather's birthday.  And finally our server arrived and asked if it was a special occasion... I again, for the fourth time told him it was Heather's birthday.   I don't recall any of those four to acknowledge it and wish Heather a Happy Birthday.  Our server came by twice before I asked him if we could order our drinks.   It felt like it took 10 minutes for the drinks to arrive and as the waiter was leaving I asked if we could order.  All employees were pleasant enough, but none seemed to know what was going on.  It felt as if all were on their first week on the job and first time in the service industry.  Food was great, atmosphere was awesome, views were amazing.  Service could  use some coaching and development."}
{"text":"Service by Jerry was awesome. Food was good, but not great on certain dishes. Great ambiance & atmosphere"}
{"text":"The view was beautiful & i enjoyed that, food was okay, but too much sauce on our appetizer & on our main course. I would recommend asking it for on the side. Drinks took awhile to get but food was quick. Service was not the best, but she got us what we needed."}
{"text":"Third time eating here, and I decided to step out of my meat and veggie comfort zone.  Whoa!  I was blown away by the eggplant bisque.  The taste was amazing, it was thick but too creamy and full of flavor!  I also had the pear salad.  Straight A+!    My wife had the Kobe steak, which had great seasoning but I was unimpressed by the Kobe!  Seems like overpriced skirt steak.    Last the service and hospitality was amazing.  Another positive experience.  Totally recommend going to check this out, but watch out for the parking - it sucks!!!"}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend for our 2 year anniversary. We hadn't heard many good reviews about the food but I figured it was worth a shot to try it out ourselves. The food was good, but not good enough to justify the expensive prices. However, that wasn't the problem.  We had ordered a $40 bottle of wine, which was a Robert Mondavi. We aren't very familiar with wine and didn't thoroughly review the wine list, so we weren't aware that there were multiple Mondavi wines on the list. When the waitress brought out the bottle, she explained it as the House wine, and we didn't see 'Mondavi' anywhere on the label.  When I asked if that was the Robert Mondavi, she responded, \"Oh, you want the M?\". When I asked if this was the Mondavi, she said yes so we had it brought out. The bottle said 'Mondavi' on it so when she asked if this was it, we assumed it was.  Turns out this was a $255 bottle of wine, a far cry from the $40 bottle we wanted. The waitress did NOT say that the original wine was in fact a Mondavi when I asked and instead brought out one of their most expensive bottles.  It really was just a huge miscommunication, but the manager was extremely rude and not only threatened to call the cops and have us arrested for theft, but then proceeded to talk poorly about us in the kitchen, which we could hear. We ended up getting a small discount from the check but in the end I was extremely unimpressed with our service and definitely would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Not worth the views."}
{"text":"Horribly shockingly overpriced. Decided against dinner after reading reviews, looking at the menu and settled on drinks and desert. 3 drinks and a $10 desert was $60 bill, parking was $15. I will never bother to go back."}
{"text":"This is the coolest, most romantic, delicious, amazing restaurant I've ever been to. I'm glad I could take my boyfriend:)"}
{"text":"I was here for my birthday last night and we had a good time. I don't understand the people complaining about the prices. It's a high end restaurant so of course it's going to be pricey, it's like complaining about the smell of fish at a sea food restaurant.   My girlfriend ordered the filet mignon cooked medium well and I had the flat iron steak medium rare. We both shared the meat and cheese appetizer as well as a bread basket. The meat and cheese platter was delicious and kept us busy while we waited for our main dishes. I especially enjoyed the pickled cauliflower and everything from the tangy cheese and sweet jam all went really well with each other when mixed together. We went to town on the bread basket that came with whipped butter, whipped honey butter and salt. The honey butter was the first to go and the cornbread that came in the bread basket was an unexpected but delicious surprise. The staff was awesome at keeping our water flowing and keeping our table clean in between courses. My flat iron steak was cooked exactly how I asked it to be and it was delicious, along with the asparagus and sauces that garnished my plate. I had some of the left over filet mignon from my girlfriend's plate and that too was nice and tender and seasoned well. My girl also really enjoyed her strawberry cooler that she got. At the end of our meal we got a complimentary birthday dessert. I went with the sweet potato pie parfait. It had a few pieces of caramelized bacon on top that complimented the rest of the dessert.  The view of course was something unique to Compass and that along with the good food and great service will have us coming back."}
{"text":"It was a very nice environment. The service was excellent! Definitely a beautiful view at night. While the room spun very slowly, my wife felt a little bit of dizziness at first. If you're prone to dizziness, you might want to avoid this restaurant.  The food was a mix. My wife loved the shrimp (3huge shrimp, $18). The lobster chowder was also great (though perhaps a bit too much corn). She also enjoy the calamari, though the sauce was a little too tarter sauce like. I had the crab cakes (spot on) and the chicken dinner. The chicken was flavorful, if not a bit too salty. The Brussels and quinoa were the best part of the dish.  I had the Hefenweizen ~:] It was a god local brew, yet my frugality only allowed me to order two, knowing I just paid the equivalent of a twelve pack...yep.  Most people are likely the same as us, come for the experience. If this is you, it's worth it at least once. Just make note, if you get dizzy easily, it may not be for you!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a reservation for dinner on a Monday night. We were walking around downtown for a while and couldn't wait to eat, so we grabbed a piece of pizza on the street below, but wanted to have a fancy desert. We got up the the Compass, were seated and told our server that we had dinner, but would like to see the desert menu. Our obviously annoyed server went directly to the manager and had a few words. After a minute she came by and asked us to leave, since we had dinner reservations, and weren't eating dinner we needed to leave.   I'd completely understand this if the restaurant were full, and we wouldn't have even wanted to be seated if people were waiting. There was literally 1 other table seated. We were surrounded by empty tables.   They refused to serve us on some stupid technicality. They just didn't want our money. We continued on our way and had ice cream at a place down on the street.    Get bent Compass, you exist in downtown Phoenix, get over yourself and serve your customers."}
{"text":"Went for anniversary dinner here. Was our first time. Made reservations a week in advance and they were prompt to answer and make the reservation. Dinner and service was awesome. Our server was Anthony and he was phenomenal.  He was attentive, helpful, and very kind to us. We had the filet mignon and flat iron steak which we loved. We also had the bruschetta for appetizer which was very tasty. We loved the view, environment was perfect, and was a fantastic way to celebrate. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here and what a wonderful experience. Had a reservation at 530 which is the sweet spot. You get to see the city while the sun is still up, sunset, and night time with a complete 360 view of downtown and beyond. Service was excellent and very attentive. Carla (maybe with a K?) was wonderful and made sure drinks were refilled and everything came out as ordered and explained some of the items to us. We had a party of 5 for a graduation and we started with the calamari which was a large plate full and more than enough for everybody. And the size of the calamari were big too. Not skimpy or just pure breaded. We ordered the salmon, seafood pasta, filet, and ribeye. It was al very delicious. For some items, you got an option of sauce to top it with, only recommendation I would make is maybe have a chefs recommendation next to the menu item with what sauce pairs best, but it is nice to have three different options to top with. The main items were all delicious and cooked to order. The sides were almost better than the main dishes themselves. The mashed potatoes were great and oh my god, the bacon-Brie macaroni was amazing. I'm a big mac and cheese fan, and this is definitely top 3. For dessert we got the black and white cake. It's very sweet and thick so a couple of bites and I was down for the count so it's best to split it. All in all in was a great experience and definitely something every native Arizonan or tourist should check out especially for the views of the 360 degree rotating restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here before for drinks but my boyfriend I decided to go there for dinner to celebrate our birthdays.  And I have to say, I would go back for drinks and the ambiance but definitely not to eat ever again.  I do not mind paying higher prices for special occasion dinners, but the food there is not worth HALF of what we paid.  We ordered the shrimp ceviche, the tortilla chips were stale and the shrimp tasted like it was frozen.  Our seafood entrees were also just ok, not worth $38 a plate.    Our server Julian and server assistant Gina (I think that was her name) were so unwelcoming and not what I would expect at a place like that.  They didn't smile and were not personable at all.  The receptionist asked us when we arrived if we were celebrating anything special and we told them both of our birthdays, and honestly I was expecting MAYBE a slice of cake, but nothing ever came.  Oh well :("}
{"text":"The Compass has the most amazing view of Phoenix!! The rotating restaurant has a very romantic feel-great for date night! Order the filet mignon with the mashed potatoes. Divine!"}
{"text":"There is just not a better place in Phoenix to take out of town guests to see the view.    My Mom and I brought our friends there who were visiting from New York....   The view(s) are breathtaking... especially if you make reservations just before sunset... you get to see the daytime and nighttime views.   It's a quiet elegant atmosphere and makes for a truly memorable evening...  But.... Then there's the food.    We ordered their appetizer special which was shredded veal in a pastry and sounded amazing, but the pastry was hard and crumbly.  The veal was flavorful, but the pastry was so hard that it seemed to soak up the moisture from the meat.    Their menu selection is a bit limited, there's not a lot to choose from.   I had the Pan Seared Scallops with the corn succotash.   My scallops did not have a nice carmelized sear on them which I was really hoping for, in fact, they were a bit under cooked in my opinion.  The corn succotash was pretty good.   I had a taste of my friend's jalapeno cheddar risotto cakes- and I was really quite embarrased that I brought them here and they had to eat that!   It was bland and sticky... not even a slight tinge of flavor.   They said they enjoyed their steaks, but I can't imagine anyone being thrilled with that side item.    I tried my Mom's Brown Sugar Cured Pork Chop and it was 'fine'.    This restaurant really has a market cornered on view and ambiance, but I don't think they take very good advantage of it.     I don't ever remember coming here when it was packed.  Why not?  It's the sign of a great restaurant, but this one is not that great because of the food.   I wish they'd step up their game and serve better food.  It would be a place I would go to on a regular basis instead of just when I had visitors."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was amazing! Food was delicious! Staff was delightful. I took students and they all four felt like princesses!"}
{"text":"the service was superb and the view is amazing but the food is very forgettable. I had the duck tostada, very salty, not much other flavor, waaay too big duck pieces,the meat-tortilla ratio was very off, there was hardly any avocado and salsa. not recommended. i also had the pork chops with brie polenta. once again, the pork was salty and no other flavors whatsoever, the brie polenta lacked the brie and the apple coleslaw hardly had any apples in it. the maple bbq sauce wasn't very special and the food is quite a bit overpriced. they have an impressive wine list, though. for this reason, plus service and the view the 3 star rating. go there for a glass of wine and an appetizer and enjoy the view."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! The only thing this place has going for it is the view. Food was mediocre at best. Over priced for what it is. If you want to experience the view, go to the bar and get a drink and go somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"I keep reading to go for the view and not the food. I am particular about food and I loved my meal! I ordered the sea bass ad it was a huge and super fresh portion! I will admit the pesto rice was not super flavorful but I still wouldn't turn it down. They came out with gluten free bread slices for me when they noticed I was not eating the bread.   Y husband got the steak and loved it!  Of course the view is fantastic. The ambiance was very romantic with the dim lighting at night. Service was great too. I will certainly be back"}
{"text":"This was a horrible experience . The food was of poor quality and appearance had a better dinner at Denny's . I had the hand cut pasta it had more onions in it than chicken or pasta I sent it back . The dinner my Husban had was changed without telling us and it was cold .  It is a really nice place with great atmosphere I suggest you only go there for drinks that was about the only thing that was good"}
{"text":"Love love love the views of downtown Phoenix!  Food was amazing, friendly service, and a great atmosphere! They made my daughters birthday dinner so memorable..."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for a while. The ambiance is beautiful. It spins faster than I anticipated. If you're fearful of heights stay away.  The food was good. We started with the pear salad. It was delicious, but small. My friend and I were concerned about the sizes of the entrees but we were in for a plesant surprise. I had the scallops and my other had the short rib canilloni. Both dishes were substantial and delicious. We ended with the cobbler and fried zucchini bread. The bread was wonderful. I would go back and recommend it. FYI - don't park in the Chase garage. They don't accept their validation."}
{"text":"I'm hesitant to even give 3 stars. The view and concept are spectacular! It takes an hour for the restaurant to rotate completely. Don't worry! You'll see the whole thing! We still hadn't received our entrees within the first rotation.... Our service was so so. Our servers \"assistant\" Angela was at our table more the our server and she was great!  Both my bf and myself ordered the 7oz filets. Very disappointed! We ordered them medium rare and they came out med well. While the steak was still decent, it was a little dry and when you pay $40.00 for a filet you should get it cooked exactly how you ordered it. Cocktails on the other hand were great! Not sure I'd go back for the food, but may stop in for a cocktail with a view!"}
{"text":"Of course the restaurant and view are amazing. Our poor waiter had a large table right along with us so service was slow at first. However, Robert saved the night  by helping him and being very attentive to us. He seriously saved the whole experience and appreciate him and his wonderful personality!!! The food: calamari - delicious. Crab cakes- decent. Soup- lobster chowder or something seemed like it sat too long as it would have been better if it were a little warmer. I had a salad w chicken...should have not asked for the nasty chicken. Salad was great though. He had some sandwich not worth mentioning. I asked for apple crown royal, but was serve crown royal with apple juice...which I found out about after the 2nd drink. I was wondering why it was so sweet. Tip: ask for Robert to be your server!!! And don't expect too much from the menu."}
{"text":"The scenery from this restaurant is fantastic I would definitely go there for the view they serve anything from hamburgers to fillet. The dinners we had were good pot roast excellent ,beef tips good and  as many restaurants serve the vegetables -raw - not really cooked.Dress code was for men from suits to shorts and females in gowns to shorts"}
{"text":"Pretty damn nice!  I made reservations for the Compass via OpenTable and upon arrival, i was greeted by first name.  We were seated promptly and thank God I didn't pre-drink too much because the restaurant spins at a pretty steady pace.  It's a great concept and for all the theatrics, the cost of the meals were very reasonable.    I had salmon and opted for polenta with my meal instead of mashed potatoes and I'm glad to see that both grits and polenta were mainstays on their list of sides.  The only miss for me was the chili cornbread which I didn't find to be that great, although my comrades seemed to like it.    Service was prompt and consistent and I must say I enjoyed my meal and the whole spinning experience."}
{"text":"We popped up here for a drink, the view was amazing, staff was pleasant. Price is obviously high - but you are paying for the view. Their choices of wine is limited. Their choice of appetizers is slim and not appetizing. Which was a bummer! Hopefully they can expand the options! We would have spent a bit of time and money there, but alas we simply enjoyed our wine and the view and left. Luckily they didn't care too much about dress code - we were allowed access in shorts! Great place for a date or romantic evening! Note: Elevator is open glass. And elevator will only go to that floor when the restaurant is open, and it doesn't open at 4pm! Check the signs. only certain elevators go up to the top!"}
{"text":"We have been here for dinner and it was for my husband's birthday. It was a surprise planned for him and he absolutely loved it. Even now I cant stop talking about the best view I have got of the entire city and revolving 360 degrees... JUST LOVE IT.  We both are vegeterians and this is always a problem when we dont find good vegeterian food(we end up having chesse pizza) But, this was totally totally a different experience for us. We had our stomach full by the time we left the restaurant and each and every dish was so tasty and delicious. More importantly I am so happy that my husband just loved it and we both were just looking at the whole view of the city, and enjoying our dinner. We also loved the fact that it revolves and I must say that this is the best restaurant we have been to in the last couple of years in Phoenix. Also, the price is way much lesser than what we have spent for food in some other restaurants which was not worth it.    Thank you so much compass arizona grill for your welcoming smiles, the best view and tasty food.. We will definitely visit this place again."}
{"text":"The view is amazing. Phoenix is not the best looking city but is nice. The food didnt blow me away but I would go again because the environment is nice and the strawberry daquiri was sooo good!! I had the fried calamari, the filet mignon sandwich and also the lobster bisque which was cold."}
{"text":"The view was great, food......not so great! Service, well when you go there for a birthday and they know about and don't bring a dessert, kind of messes up the night!!! We blame the waitress!!!!!"}
{"text":"The Compass room is a favorite of mine for a number of reasons.  Its central location is perfect for a night at the opera or finishing a night out.  Its menu has a fairly sophisticated selection and for the price it's a pretty good deal for a swanky hotel bar place in down town PHX. They have a fairly decent brunch on Sunday morning with generous helping of the mimosas (and they aint shy about pouring) Not an everyday place for sure but a place to take the folks while they visit from out of town and have them wow'ed at the pretty lights as they stand elevated looking at the valley, or to take that special date where you want a memorable quiet night to get to know each other. The service is what you would expect from a place of this caliber and the wine selection is not out of this world...but hey you must remember you are really on top of the Hyatt :P  All and all worth while experience."}
{"text":"Oh how I wish I had taken a picture of the very sad excuse for a $17 Meat and Cheese plate we were served last night in the bar area. One cheese (some dried out herbed Brie and very little of it). One meat (prosciutto). A huge stack of bread (4 thick olive oil slices and four thick brown nut bread) four huuuuge pickled onions (inedible really - a thinly shaved version would have paired better with the bread and meats), four dill pickle slices, and some admittedly delicious jam.   It was pretty awful. I was interested in seeing other pics of it and sure enough, there are other pics of overflowing platters of delicious meat and cheese filled boards which made it even more insulting.   I mean, if you put an order in for your customer and you find out the kitchen ran out of half the meat and cheese, be straight up. Right? Offer a different option or price it accordingly.   Nice view of the city. Nice enough bartender waited on us. Just too tired to raise the issue last night. I hope they glean something from my review and strive to improve late night food options. It's such a pretty view and nice central location."}
{"text":"I made my reservation for 6 pm and was running a little late due to rush hour traffic while picking up my friend I was treating to dinner. I called to let the hostess we were running a little late. We arrived and I valeted my car. Be aware that self parking is validated and valet parking receives a $2 off validation. I deal with parking all the time living and working downtown so I just splurged and went the valet way.   Upon arriving up on the 24th floor we were greeted by a friendly hostess along with a new employee being trained. We were promptly seated. Our server's name was Patty. She has worked at Compass for 29 years she said, and it showed in a very positive way. She was very sweet, and knew exactly how to do her job. I love a server who can converse and be down to earth while maintaining a certain level of professionalism. She was awesome.   We ordered their very popular Eggplant Bisque Soup. The portion seemed a little small at first but even Patty mentioned that the soup is fairly rich. She was right! The portion was just right for this soup which was delicious but would of been way to filling if the size had been any larger.   They gave us little cornbread muffins with a couple of different flavored butters with a side of sea salt. These were yummy, but nothing mind blowing. It brought back memories of the cornbread my parents made when I was a kid.   I ordered the scallops which came with a corn risotto. The scallops were huge and very flavorful. The risotto was very good but I have to admit I wasn't a huge fan of the way it looked. That's me being picky though, it was still very good.   For desert we decided to have the fried zucchini bread and it was really good.   The prices are pretty hefty, the food was good, but really my server Patty and the amazing view of Phoenix while the sun went down is what pulled me in with this place. I would be sure to recommend people to sit with Patty as she really was a pleasure having as our server. I must say too that the girl that refreshed our drinks and water was very sweet too. She talked with us about the Suns game going on the evening we dined, as I saw traffic picking up downtown which doesn't usually happen on a Wednesday evening.   Overall I say the food is a tad bit overpriced for the portions that are received, the decor could be changed up a little but it's a rotating restaurant after all. I enjoyed my meal, my friend enjoyed his meal, and I left happy. This would be a great place to take someone who hasn't seen Phoenix before as it makes you feel like you're in a big city and shows how far Phoenix goes with the views. Oh and ask for Patty, she's awesome! It probably would of been a three star review, but service goes a long way with me. I can handle just good food if I have amazing service."}
{"text":"Great food for as late as we came (10:30). The candied prosciutto flatbread was delicious and not skimpy on the toppings (Brie, pear, prosc.) and the charcuterie board was generous and well-curated. (Duck prosciutto, Brie, cheddar, smoked blue cheese [AMAZING], homemade pickles, bar nuts, salame, and prosciutto)   Crab cakes were a lil skimpy, but the excellent cocktail and wine made up for it.   Staff was forthcoming but we sensed some hostility about halfway through the night, we assume bc it was closing and we had ordered three plates :P   For a hotel revolving restaurant, definitely exceeded expectations."}
{"text":"Settled in on the 24th floor of the Hyatt Regency Hotel in downtown Phoenix Arizona, the Compass Grill is a rotating restaurant with an incredible view of the city. This was my second time dining here, and I had such great memories of the first time. If you can set your reservation for around 5:30-6:00 PM, I recommend that so you can experience it during the day and night and also watch the sun go down. It's typically doesn't open until 5 PM so it's strictly a dinner restaurant. It's definitely advised to make a reservation as it does get popular and packs in fast. I recognize it is very much a date night kind of restaurant. A lot of couples were there. The first time we went there I dined with my fiancé and his family. The second time, my fiancé hadn't gotten into town yet so it was only myself and my fiancé's parents. I ordered sn Italian Pinot Grigio, and my fiancé's dad ordered a bourbon. He ordered it near, he always orders it on the rocks so I asked him why. He said because the last time we dined there the restaurant charged him for a glass of rocks. FYI, the ice will cost you. They brought out jalapeño and chili cornbread and multi grain rolls with honey butter and regular, whipped butter. I ordered a beet and burrata salad with salmon. You can choose your protein on any of their salads and customize it to your liking. My fiancé's mother had the lobster bisque and wedge salad, and my fiancé's father order the filet with roasted, heirloom potatoes. Everyone seemed more than satisfied with your meal. The service was great as well. All of the items came out in great timing. We were never hungry or impatient, and we had a lot of time to converse in between each item was dropped. Altogether it only cost $132 which is not bad for a fine dining experience. I recommended this restaurant not only for its food, but for the unique atmosphere and breathtaking environment/view."}
{"text":"People always tell me to sit and spin! Here, on top on the Hyatt, did JUST THAT... and ate at the same time.  Its a multi-tasker's dream!!!!  This place is pretty amazing.  I have only been here for evening dinners and drinks, but I can tell you that it is a great venue for a special occasion.  I took my lovely lady here for a birthday and for an anniversary, so I pretty much played this out. However, you can still go!!!  If you are a fan of Prime Rib, you have GOT to try the Compass Room's version.  It is cooked in a Merlot which makes it taste uber-fancy and your significant other will want to strip you down right there and thank you properly. For desert, try the Tiramasu.  It has thick chocolate walls printed with the signature 'Compass Room' and will put everyone in the mood for a party!  The price is pretty high.  Like Amy said, about $80 per head. But definitely worth it.  For this, I believe the Compass Room's logo should be \"Sit, Spin, Go Home and Get Some\"  Do it. Do it."}
{"text":"I went to the Compass during restaurant week and absolutely loved it! Definitely a great place to bring a date. In my case I brought my family. The service was great and we enjoyed the food. The only issue I had is that I had a reservation for  a party of six. When we arrived the table was not pushed together in advance. My family and I actually had to push it together ourselves and for such an elegant restaurant I did have higher expectations."}
{"text":"My prom date brought me here 10 years ago. Hmm...I wonder what he was expecting at the end of the night. Although he thought that tanning until he was as red as a lobster was the new black this was one of his better judgment calls.    We had a window seat and I mesmerized him with fascinating facts about the city, which were on little plaques along the windows. It really took him until the end of dinner to figure it out. Anyway, I am sure the menu has changed, but the salad and shrimp with angel hair pasta I had that night were yummy. Cool view. I will have to come back sometime to see how the valley has changed from this view."}
{"text":"Here's the deal.  You want to take your in-town guests to a place with the ABSOLUTE best views in town?  Then this is the place.  If you want to take them to the place with the best food in town, this is NOT the place.  In fact, I think for the price, if you get the steaks, and even the salad, i think you will be a little disappointed, especially with the prices they charge.  And whatever you do, when they offer you the choice (which I often find to be a tacky maneuver) \"do you want tap water or bottled water\" makes sure you do the BOTTLED water.  The tap water tasted, well, like tap.    At any rate, because this is the best and most amazing view in town, i will be going back for the rotating 360 views.  I will also ask to sit in the \"party section\" (which is tables that look more fun than the other dining tables they have, and I am going to find SOMETHING on that menu that actually tastes good.  I agree with some other posts I have seen, you cannot go wrong with the CORNBREAD, but I need to find something else that's good (man cannot live on cornbread and butter alone).  Blue cheese salad was disappointing; mac and cheese so-so, fried asparagus so-so, pig tacos were not bad, and the tamale dish was so-so (yes, we sampled as this was our first time).  Honestly, they need to find a new meat vendor.  Just not very tasty (even for street tacos the next morning).  Anyway, I love the concept so i will go back and try again.  Will report back after next time in.    ATTORNEY STEVE TIP:  To have a fun time with your business guests, friends, out of state guests, etc., do a play at the Herberger Theater and then walk across the street to this place.  Can't beat it.  Have fun, and find your sizzle!  Attorney Steve, the business and real estate lawyer. http://www.attorneysteve.net"}
{"text":"This is a great date night dinner.  The food was good, the views are awesome especially at sunset! We went for my man's bday and they brought out a birthday cheesecake for him without me even asking which I thought was super cool. Cheesecake is his fav so that was super cool. The only downfall is that we waited  like 45 mins for the food to actually come out. But other than that we had a great dinner."}
{"text":"I'm only giving them two stars because of the concept/view. The food tasted like I was at Dennys after a night of drinking. My steak was mostly fat and had no taste to it. I understand the premium for food cost because of the experience but come onnnnnn, at least make the food good.   I will never come back here for dinner but would be a cool place for drinks."}
{"text":"Humiliated, disgusted, and amazed at the lack of professionalism! I have stayed at this hotel many times. I have always enjoyed the atmosphere and hospitality that I have received in the past. \"In The Past\" Hyatt has definitely seen a change in its customer satisfaction I had an unfortunate incident, and when I requested to speak with the General manager to resolve the issue of several specific charge disputes I was refused.  Only after my own research was I able to leave a message for the General Managers assistant.  I have yet to receive an explanation for charges, an accurate charge, or communication from anyone from this restaurant and Hyatt Hotel. The incident was that there was \"1\" bottle of wine that was misrepresented to myself and guest who unintentionally ordered a bottle of wine for the amount of $545.00  Now I can appreciate a good wine, but I was not prepared for this purchase nor was I expecting this charge. To my surprise when I received the bill for $595.00 I requested to speak to the manager. I requested from manager to review the menu with me and to discuss an option for payment as I did not have the immediate means to$595.00 on me at that moment and that I would gladly leave my card and drivers licence with home till morning when I would return with payment. He inexcusably humiliated my guest and I in front of other guest, staff, and each other by making us sit there for an hour and a half before calling the police to have me arrested for theft. I over and over again explained that I was able and willing to pay for the wine I just had to wait for bank to open or for credit card to release funds.  I showed the manager my checking account which had a balance of $547,563.21 and that I would gladly pay for the wine that I disputed purchasing in the first place to avoid getting incarcerated by the local police department. The police were very kind and compassionate to the situation while they escorted us from the Hotel. The next morning I reviewed my credit card charges only to find that the Hotel had charged me 14 times in the amount of $1200.00!!! Not one charge attempt for $545.00! When I called and emailed the manager with bank statements and requested his review and to give me a explanation for the charges... Did he respond  No!! I travel very frequently, as well as being a member and employee of AAA I would not recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. My boyfriend surprised me by taking us here for our anniversary and I was blown away. I almost feel bad for not immediately noticing that the whole place was spinning. The views were fantastic! Even saw a lightening storm in the distance. Being from out of town I didn't even know this place existed nor had I any predispositions. We enjoyed the lobster bisque & sandwiches, as well as our classy waitress. I would say that the chicken pesto club is pretty bland however. I was slightly disappointed that everyone congratulated us on our anniversary but we didn't get anything for it- no complimentary drinks, dessert anything. Even Black Angus gives you free dessert.."}
{"text":"The prefect beginning to a romantic date.  The Compass Room is atop the The Hyatt Regency in downtown Phoenix.  The restaurant rotates and if you go during sunset will give you one of the most breath taking views of the valley.  You end up paying for the view though, as the prices on the menu are rather high.  The food is good quality but be prepared around 80-90 dollars for two people (salad, dinner and desert) as well as drinks.  Fun place to go for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Nice environment, amazing view of Downtown Phoenix, and good food and drinks.  Walking inside, you instantly get that rush of movement because of the slow rotating restaurant; I recommend if you are prone to motion sickness to either take medication prior or not go. Plus if you combine the effects of alcohol you'll be spinning in all sorts of directions.  The food is good although a bit of an odd fusion of flavors. They serve a basket of bread and fresh butter. They give one dish with two palettes of butter. One is plain and the other has a sweet taste to it. The bread is fresh. They had a cornbread mixed with green chili peppers which had an excellent flavor.  We ordered drinks. My girlfriend ordered a pineapple martini. Me being a scotch/whiskey/stout guy decides to try a signature cocktail of theirs: White Peach Sangria. Didn't realize how feminine the drink would be served. Picture a wine glass with white sangria, a slice of lemon, orange and a maraschino cherry inside completed with two straws to sip out of. I didn't hear the end of it from the girlfriend...  For entrees, my girlfriend had the Market Fish which was a Halibut over Lobster Polenta and some citrus puree. I had a Pot Roast mixed with seasonal veggies (mine had red potatoes, squash, broccoli, carrots, and onion). The Pot Roast was good, however I have to say it's a lot saucier than anticipated. The sauce they marinate it in was quite sour, definitely too much vinegar; if it were sweeter I would've been happier. I managed to find a few slivers of beef not doused in sauce and it was tender, juicy, and beautifully flavored to the point I would've wanted a pot roast without sauce.  The Halibut was a little peculiar. Maybe it was our taste buds, but it wasn't very favorable between us. The polenta, from what I could understand, was cooked with lobster so you get a hint of sweet shellfish in the crumbly polenta; I could taste the subtleness but she couldn't. The halibut was cooked but was at an odd semi-warm temperature. The dish was served with a green puree that was a little too citrusy for our taste.  Overall we had a pleasant experience. I will have to say there were a few things that caught my attention. When arriving in the hotel, we were guided to the elevators and told to take the set with glass to the 24th floor where the restaurant is. Unfortunately the call button calls a set of elevators opposite of the restaurant ones as well, so it can be a while before one of the three restaurant elevators, also used for hotel guests, makes it to you.  The other thing is service can be slow but I feel it has to do with drinks being made on ground level and the servers having to redirect themselves to their tables because the restaurant rotates. It's a wonderful experience for locals and visitors to see the State Capitol at sunset. Definitely on the pricey side and I highly recommend reserving in advance."}
{"text":"If you've never been, go. It's such a great experience. I don't know of any other place like this. The service was excellent; food was good; but the experience is like no other. I made reservations for my son's 16th birthday dinner with family. We don't usually dress up and go out for dinner, but in business formal attire, we all went out and had a great time!! He loved it! There were 12 of us and we all loved it.  On a side note, I'm really scared of heights, but I have to admit, it's not too bad. I just closed my eyes during the elevator ride up. :-)"}
{"text":"Let's get the boring bad  stuff out of the way so I can talk about the fun part.  over-priced not delicious you have two people waiting on you, but it's always slow bad water- seriously, not even a lemon can mask the disgusting flavor of their water it's always cold  honestly, if this restaurant wasn't high up and spinning, i would never go here.  i took my nieces ice skating at city scape so i figured this would be a fun place to have an over priced dinner since we were right up the street. When in Rome....or something.  I ordered some curry chicken thing and my nieces had grilled cheese off the kids menu.  we also ordered a molten cake for dessert but there was no molten? whatever, no need to to hash it because i knew going in the food sorta sucks.   Our bill was $70 but we seriously had a blast. The whole dinner was filled with gasps and excitement and sheer thrill about how fun this restaurant was."}
{"text":"Excellent experience, will go back again. Beautiful view of the Phoenix sky line."}
{"text":"Here is my experience that happened yesterday. The rating is what it is for a reason and I am sorry I had to put it that low.  This was my first visit to the Compass Arizona Grill and I was very excited the days leading to the dinner. This was a special event for me and my girlfriend. It was our 3 year anniversary exactly on that day so I wanted to make it a memorable experience. To start off, I made the reservation about 4 days ahead of time and made two special requests; I wanted to have a window seat with my girlfriend and I requested a \"Happy Anniversary\" type of writing they could do on the dessert plate that we would have after dinner. The window seat request was accommodated so I was happy with that, but I really wanted to make sure the special dessert request was fulfilled.  Here were my attempts to make this happen: 1. When I made my online reservation, I made sure to type up my request for the dessert. There was a fill-in box available for these types of things. 2. I called the day before my reservation to confirm that my request was seen and could be done. I talked to a hostess I believe and she assured me that the \"Happy Anniversary.. \" could be put on a plate. 3. Day of my dinner - Me and my girlfriend are done with our dinner. The waitress at this point now offered us dessert. I said yes please. We get the dessert menu and I am thinking that I just want to go ahead and make sure that everyone is good to go. I smoothly excused myself from the table and went to the bathroom. After exiting the bathroom I talked to the hostess and confirmed with her my request. She pulled up my last name and said she will make sure the server takes care of it.   What happens when the dessert gets to our table.. it doesn't have the lettering.  It does have two candles lit on it and the server did say happy anniversary.  It was nice but I cannot figure out how it didn't get taken care of after making THREE heroic efforts to make it happen!!! lol.  If any of you look at the customer photos for this restaurant you will see that someone got exactly what I wanted! So I know its POSSIBLE!   In the end I didn't get what I tried reallllyyyyyyy hard for, the server dropped a glass cup that shattered right next to me and my girlfriend and the bread was not very warm.  No consistency really with all the food temperature and the steak was pretty chewy.  I will say that the views were great and the rotating restaurant concept was really cool so that is why I didn't give one star .. bottom line.  If they could really improve the service and food, this place could be a 5 star restaurant, because you won't find any other revolving restaurants anywhere in Arizona."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my 21st birthday last year and the steak was delicious! It is very pricy for a small portion but the steaks just have an amazing taste. Their grilled asparagus have a great flavor too. The mashed potatoes are so yummy too! The customer service could be better, the waiter didn't even say happy birthday to me even tho I had just told him it was my birthday and I wanted to try something really good. Also they didn't have a big variety of desserts, the ones that were listed didn't even sound appetizing so I didn't order any. Their drinks were pretty good tho I had an alcoholic beverage which was sweet and had the right amount of alcohol in it. Oh and don't drink too much because the restaurant rotates slowly you could barely tell it was moving at all but after awhile I got a bit dizzy. I would recommend this place to others and I would come again but of course on a special day."}
{"text":"I can't beleive this place doesn't have more reviews.  A group of us had gone for cocktails and wanted to do something a little different, so we decided to go to Compass.  I live in downtown Phoenix and I absolutely love it, but after seeing the gorgeous view from Compass, I love it even more.  The staff is professional and the drinks are very reasonably priced.  I will hope to be able to put 5 stars after I have dinner from here."}
{"text":"I have to give the Compass 5 stars because I made a reservation for a four top for Valentine's Day eve and had no problems. We arrived a little before on time and were seated within just a hand full of minutes. While we were there we experienced perfect service and delicious food. We were treated very well and the wait staff was outstanding.   I have a complaint or really a suggestion, however. Since we have never been to the Compass before we maybe don't know the way holidays, Eve's, weekends, or otherwise may be set up and though we went on line for a glimpse of the menu and seating, and made reservations, there was nothing that told us anywhere that there was going to be a special limited menu for 2/13. $85 dollars a person is a little steap (especially when signature drinks are not included). If you are expecting to spend $$$$ that is one thing. We could have gotten up and left but not only would that have been beyond embarrassing, we didn't want to. We were psyched about having the experience and looked forward to it for weeks. What was funny, and a little embarrassing, was watching the couples who were seated near us after us realizing the same thing and having the same debate with eachother that we had. \"Did you know it was a special menu tonight?\" \"Are you sure you want to spend $240?\" \"Should we leave?\" Honestly, we were glad we weren't alone.   At the end of the night we had a great time and will tell the story for years."}
{"text":"It seems to me that this restaurant is more of a novelty than a fine place to dine and take in the 360 degree view of Phoenix.  The decor is tired and the windows weren't really clean....which was a turn off as the sun went down.  The scallops I ordered were a bit tough and slightly fishy and the wheat berries were not quite al dente.  The coconut creme brûlée trio only offered one of the three as palatable...I couldn't eat the other two.  Fortunately, I had a good server who knows his stuff.  Noticing I didn't eat the other two brûlées, he offered to take it off the bill for me.  I left a generous tip just for that.  I guess it would be a fine place for a prom date, but found my $50 dinner bill a bit steep for my experience."}
{"text":"Great view. Food is not good at all. Disappointed.  We had the weird purple calamari appetizer and it tasted weird just the way it looked. The lobster chowder wasn't good either.   Will not be back. They tried hard with the food presentation but just not to par to any descent restaurant.service was good."}
{"text":"A wonderful dining experience as you revolve atop the Hyatt Regency Hotel in downtown Phoenix.    This restaurant, with its valet parking, and walking distance to most events makes for the perfect downtown dining experience.  Beside that, the food and service as great.    Here's our review, complete with video: http://www.theroamingboomers.com/?p=5211"}
{"text":"Last night my wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary at Compass Arizona Grill. The waitstaff was very courteous and attentive, as our glasses were never less than half full. We ordered the bruschetta as our appatizer. We both had lamb, hers well done and mine medium. These were cooked to perfection! My wife ordered the asparagus for a side and I ordered the heirloom popatoes and both were delicious. We were surprised with a small cheesecake a la mode for dessert. I looked up the sunset time prior to our reservation and the view did not disappoint. Our waiter,Julian, was great! Only deducting one star for the smaller portion lamb compared to other places we've had it. Other than that, it was a great anniversary dinner. Thanks to everyone at Compass Arizona Grill."}
{"text":"Great View! Went here for dessert  had several different things but the best was the strawberry short cake. This made it worth it all!  Didn't have dinner here so i gave it a 4 until next time."}
{"text":"I ate at the Compass two nights while staying at the Hyatt. Both meals were excellent.  The scallops, however, were out of this world. Amazing blend of flavors added a unique punch. The staff was friendly and inviting, much more so than at other upscale restaurants I've been. Seating was prompt. Very nice experience and of course you can't top the view."}
{"text":"Let me first start off by saying that this is an upscale restaurant, located in the heart of downtown Phoenix, inside a major hotel and . . .  are you ready for it??? . . .  it spins so that as you dine you get to enjoy a 360*, panoramic, constant changing view of Phoenix.  That alone should scream PRICEY!!   For anyone who has ever dined at a formal, upscale dining establishment such as this, you know that the price is high while the portions are small.  However, the food is worth it.  This is true of The Compass Arizona Grill.   My husband had the filet, while I enjoyed the seared scallops.  The filet was done med. rare, flavorful and melted in your mouth.  The scallops were tender and succulent with just the right amount of butter.  At the end of our meal we decided to share a dessert (the Chocolate Pot . . .) which was just the right amount of sweetness and rich decadence we were looking for.   Over all the ambiance and the food made this one of the nicest dining experiences.  If you can afford it and understand that pricey doesn't always mean a large portion but does mean excellent food, then I highly recommend The Compass Arizona Grill."}
{"text":"We had a great time at the compass grill. I had one of their specialty cocktails, wish I could remember the name but it was one of the bourbon drinks. It was superb! The small garden salad was terrific. I let the server know about my dairy and egg sensitivities, she helped me navigate the menu. I ended up with the salmon and brussel sprouts. The sprouts were the best I have ever had. Wish we had time to stay for dessert, but we were headed across the street to a concert. The only draw back was the time it took to get the food. The server mentioned we should order quickly since the restaurant was getting really busy. We did, but it still took a while. We got there at 5:45 and didn't get out until after 7. Can't wait to go back again one day, I'll add a little more buffer for time next time. The views are great. The sun can be intense but it moves along quickly enough that you aren't in it for too long. I recommend this!"}
{"text":"We wanted to check out the revolving restaurant here. Made dinner reservations for 7:30 PM and were seated promptly. The views are really pretty! We just missed the sunset, but the view was still very nice - filled with the skyline and lights. It was a bit chilly while eating there, so definitely bring something to cover up!   For drinks, we ordered the William Hill cab (I thoroughly enjoyed this) and the sparking raz. For an appetizer, we ordered the calamari, which was a little underwhelming as it wasn't served with the normal aioli or cocktail sauce and the portion. I would say pass on ordering this appetizer. For entrees, we ordered the shrimp capellini pasta and the ribeye off of the summer menu with the additions of creamed corn and the pork-braised greens. The ribeye was pretty disappointing - it was cooked medium rare but still tough. One thing I do know is that you must order the pork-braised greens. I think that was honestly the highlight of the food selections.   Overall, the service was very friendly but the food was a little disappointing especially for the price point. The rotating restaurant concept was pretty cool, but I'd definitely only come back for drinks and the view."}
{"text":"View as everyone suggests is very nice.  I had the greens salad with apple and goat cheese with a honey vinaigrette...very good.  Grouper was \"sustainable\" meal.  Rubbery texture.  Disappointing. Maybe for dessert or a drink but would not go back for dinner."}
{"text":"Went there for my daughter's birthday. The view was AMAZING the food was not! The fries that came with our hamburger and chicken sandwich looked and tasted like grocery store bought frozen fries. The chicken sandwich was bland with way too thick chicken breast! The waiter was MIA most of the night. Would go there again for view but maybe just order an appetizer"}
{"text":"taking the elevator up to the 24th floor of the hyatt regency phoenix to the compass restaurant was pretty amazing in itself! the view was spectacular.  the hostess took us to our seat, next to a window. wow!! what a view!! the floor was moving, taking us to see the different sites throughout the city. i thought it was pretty neat that whenever you'd see a plaque on the wall, you could read about what you were looking at and its history.   our server, john, was a very nice guy. he explained the menu as well as a special \"restaurant week\" menu they had.  my husband and i ordered from the restaurant week menu. it was a three course meal, appetizer, entree and dessert.   i had the grilled romaine salad with blue crab croutons and agave vinaigrette; it was soooooo delicious! who knew that lettuce would be so good grilled?  for our entree, we both had the petite new york with grilled shrimp and a garlic mash with peppercorn demi. the steak was cooked to perfection. i wish i could say the same for the shrimp. it was just a little undercooked.   for dessert, i ordered the signature compass fudge brownie and caramel flan. it was really, really good!! the husband ordered the sopaipillas with custard. he wasn't a big fan of the crust, but really liked the custard. john, our server, bought us the molten chocolate cake. it was just alight.   this restaurant was really nice, and i would recommend it if you're looking for something different and romantic!"}
{"text":"Brought my girlfriend here for an early Valentine's Day dinner. Ambiance is great with the restaurant on top of the hotel overseeing all of downtown Phoenix. The staff is very welcoming, however, a bit slow bringing drinks from the bar. It was a Friday night but wasn't super busy to the point I had to wait 1/2 hour for a beer. Food was really good, especially the green chili cornbread!!! Price was what you would expect for similar establishment. Would recommend in the future for a special occasion. Good overall experience."}
{"text":"I had some friends visiting from London. I wanted to show them a beautiful view of the sunset. This place did not disappoint! This place was awesome. We had appetizers and drinks for four and our bill was under $100.00 the Brie fondue was delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. good options for food but lack in drinks. I personally believe there must be more coctails otherwise everything else was just perfect. And the best part is sitting on 24th floor and viewing the downtown while having dinner with your loved ones. i personally liked the Bruschetta and rosemary potatoes. The portion size is just right. Also my veg ratatouille is so nice and warm. I enjoyed this place and would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"It was a perfect experience! The view from the restaurant is incredible. My boyfriend and I experienced a beautiful Arizona sunset. I loved the warm and class ambiance as soon as you walk out from the elevator, which by the way is a colorful ride up.  The host greeted us right away and a waitress led us to a beautiful seat with a view of course. She was polite and not intrusive.  I had the herb crusted salmon with mash potatoes. Everything on the plate was perfectly seasoned. My boyfriend had the filet mignon on a hot skillet, which was the popular dish. The entire evening was so romantic. The prices were reasonably for the cuisine and experience. I will definitely come back for a special occasion dinner."}
{"text":"Was a beautiful experience, good view of the city and a great staff. The food of the worst, I recommend do not eat there. The food was Dry, no taste and very expensive. But if you want to spend a relaxing time next to your partner, the place is perfect and share your evening with some good drinks."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Hyatt for work and it was about 120 degrees out so I figured this place was close so I came here without a reservation around 7 on a Wednesday night and was seated immediately. The view is pretty and the rotating part is nice although it feels weird every so often, like it's shaking back and forth ever so slightly to regain its balance but you get used to it. It was a nice touch that they asked my name at the hostess stand and the waitress spoke to me by first name. She was polite but she was gone for 10+ minutes while I sat there with questions about the menu. I finally asked the hostess to get her. She came, was knowledgeable about the menu and the rest of the service was without a hitch. Food took only 13 min and it was delicious. The salmon was cooked to order, amazingly flavorful, not dry, and had a gorgeous crispy skin on it. Bravo. The risotto was cooked perfectly as well and although I didn't care much for the peach sauce or top salad, the salmon really was the star for me here."}
{"text":"Food was great service was very good also. Very beautiful view from the restaurant very pretty at sun set."}
{"text":"I'm modifying my original 2-star review because I just went back to the Compass and had what my wife and I consider to be the meal of our lifetime. I'm not kidding . . . it was as good as good gets. It makes me think that my original experience, where we were very disappointed by a 45 minute wait past our reservation hour, must have been a fluke. As long as you remember to use the Regency Garage and not the hotel valet, you'll have a great night. They will validate you for two hours at the Garage, but at the valet in front they will only give you a $2 discount.  My wife and I both ordered the \"Filet Oscar,\" which was the best piece of meat we've ever had in any restaurant. It was cooked to perfection, with a generous helping of crab meat on top of the steak. The large, generous portion of asparagus the steak was served atop (nearly 1/2 inch thick stalks) was steamed just right.   The side dishes are a value at $5 and were healthy portions. My wife loved the corn bread, which is a special recipe, and the waitress (a very special gal named Patty) came back to us with a copy of the recipe.  The wine selection by the glass is excellent and Patty recommended a wonderful Argentinian malbec that was just great with the steak. Wines by the glass here are available in two sizes -- they are expensive, but it looks like they are upgraded bottles than most restaurants serve by the glass.  The food is pricey here also but you'd expect to be paying for the view. Speaking of the view, WOW. There's Phoenix laid out in front of you for your inspection, making for wonderful dinner table conversation. it would be a great place for couples and special evenings, or because of the view, a great place to bring a business acquaintance where you want to impress them with some wonderful views of the Valley of the Sun.  The ride up the elevator is great, too. As I said in the beginning, however, don't use the valet unless you want to fork over some serious change to park. The Compass needs to work out a deal with valet parking in my opinion -- that's the only hitch. I hope your night is as special as ours was."}
{"text":"It makes me sad to give the Compass only 3 stars, but frankly, it's really the best I can do after this recent visit.   Don't get me wrong, the view, amazing. The service was very professional and well done. I just am very disappointed in the menu changes the Compass has made since my visit there last year with respect to the menu.   The menu is all about the grill. I guess this is fine, but it doesn't really go with the air of elegance that the Compass tries to convey. The Compass used to be about fine dining which went along with the sophistication of the room. This current menu is limited and doesn't really showcase the talents of the chef. One of the problems with the Compass is that it's so freaking dark in there, you don't really get to actually see the food. I understand why they keep it dark; so you can enjoy the lights of the city...but dammit, I do want to at least see what I'm eating. Fine dining is about all 5 senses....and some chefs really miss the mark on this. The Compass is no exception, unfortunately.   We started out with the warm brie appetizer which was a medium size hunk of brie wrapped in a crispy crust placed on top of an arugula salad. Basically, it was an overinflated cheese stick. There was more crust than brie although the arugula had a nice viniagrette on it. The tastes were fine, but I just didn't feel like they went together very well.   We shared an iceberg wedge salad. You can't really miss with a wedge and this one was good. The Maytag Bleu Cheese dressing was lovely and they added some olives and grape size tomatoes. I just wish that restaurants would make bacon a standard issue item on the iceberg wedge. It's just better with bacon.   Prior to our meals coming out, the server came to us with a display of 4 different steak knives that we could choose from to use to cut our meat. I am still kind of baffled by this and why this should be necessary for us to select our weapon of choice for the meal, but we selected a sturdy wooden handled sabre and it was adequate for our needs...I hope. LOL.   My son had the NY Steak with a huckleberry sauce. The sauce was a nice addition to the steak which on it's own was unseasoned and blah. Fine for a 9 year old, but for $33 bucks, I expect a little more. The Yukon mashed potatoes were delicious; creamy and very flavorful.   I had the prime rib with a side of chipotle macaroni and cheese. The mac and cheese was just ok. The creamy horseradish sauce that was on the side for the prime rib was good--not too horsey like some places tend to do, but just enough to add some bite to the meal. But the prime rib itself lacked flavor and charm. Disappointing considering the price and the location.  The company was great, the service was very well done, and the atmosphere was nice, but I'm afraid that this time, it was the food that was subpar and that's a shame. It's likely that the next time we are downtown for an evening at the ballet, we'll be picking another restaurant to visit.   I am also sad to say the Compass no longer serves Sunday Brunch. I used to enjoy their brunch a great deal but with the change of chef, comes a change of direction for the restaurant. Hopefully they will bring back the brunch because it was a very nice place to take out-of-towners as well as just to relax on Sunday."}
{"text":"Came again because let's face it we love the place.  Today the mister had a chicken entree that he massacred and i had the market fish selection which was a delicious Red snapper. For side i had Mac and cheese minus the bacon Brie. It taste rich idk how to explain it. It was still good. I cleaned my plate. The dessert menu didn't look impressive so we skipped desert. Our waiter as always was magnificent. And so was the Green Chili cornbread"}
{"text":"I had an absolutely terrible experience here. My fiancé and I made reservations to celebrate our engagement. They asked us what we were celebrating over the phone, and when we got there the hostess asked us as well. Our waiter on the other hand, did not care about us or ask us if we were celebrating anything. The check-in was frustrating as 3 people asked us our last name and reservation time, but then just left and had someone else deal with us. When we were sat down, we were told we could move to a different table. 20 minutes later, after sitting in silence and having nobody come up to us, our waitress came to give us water. When we asked to move, we had to wait about 10 more minutes and we're told to carry our water with us while she grabbed the menus! In a classy place I do not want to carry my own water to a different table. Absolutely not. Our blonde older waitress was extremely rude and we believe she stereotyped us based off of our young age. After our appetizer, we had to ask 2 times for the complimentary bread, and then she forgot and we had to ask again. 45 minutes after being seated we got our bread. Ridiculous. One bite into our bread and our food arrives. $27 for a plate of cold, unseasoned chicken. When I began to tell the waitress the issue, she stopped me mid sentence and yelled \" Comped!!\" (Not sure the correct spelling on that one). None of the other food looked appetizing. So we looked at the dessert menu, and nothing. Had to pay for our appetizer, and will be celebrating our ENGAGEMENT somewhere where the staff cares, is friendly, and has a decent meal."}
{"text":"fourth time coming here. most romantic reasturant i've ever been too, great lighting, great music, AMAZING food. you'll never be disappointed here."}
{"text":"I took my husband here.  The food was subpar, for the price, we expected better. The waiter was not intrusive... infact, where did our waiter go? it took forever to get service.  The view was nice, and that is the only thing worth going here for."}
{"text":"First of all I would like to start with the warm smiles and genuine greeting from all the staff . The servers were very  tentative. They took the time to print out Cinderella pictures for my daughter to color. Also recognizing it was my fiancé's birthday . They uniquely set up a table so romantic and catering to the specific occasion. The general manager of the compass Marcy set aside time To give her best wishes to my fiancé. I couldn't be more grateful FOR the amount of service my family and I received. The positive energy was so magnetic. Amazing food Amazing people breathtaking view for any occasion."}
{"text":"I was looking for either steak or seafood and as I'm staying in the hyatt I gave it a shot, despite some of the less than complimentary reviews. Well, I'm glad I did. I was undecided between steak or the sea bass and my server suggested the sea bass. What an excellent choice! It was wonderful. Cooked perfectly with excellent flavor. I accompanied this with a Michael Mondavi chardonnay which complimented the meal well. Why 4 and not 5? Wine list and spirit offerings could be a lot better. Very limited to basic spirits and the wines could vary a bit more. Otherwise this restaurant is excellent."}
{"text":"If you go, try their reverse happy hour!  It is a bargain that they charge only $5 for well drink and dessert at the rotating restaurant on the 24th floor. Although the Phoenix skyline isn't all that exciting, the restaurant still offers a nice view of the city.  If you are a tea drinker, the Compass offers Numi tea (my favourite) as well as Tazo. The peach upside down cake was generously portioned, but every component (cake/ice cream/tres leches sauce) on the plate was too sweet skyrocketing my blood sugar. I would have liked more peach slices on the cake...  Our server made a mistake of overcharging me (looking at the receipt, I noticed just right now...), but he was friendly and courteous. Next time, I'll double-check the bill before I sign and I should order a bread pudding or cheesecake!"}
{"text":"I ordered the steak medallions with mashed potatoes a little pricey but good and tender. I enjoyed it. Also had the raspberry lemon drop-delicious! The best thing about the meal."}
{"text":"A large group of about 20 of us went here last night with a reservation. When I got there, there was only a handful of people in the party that had arrived but as more people started showing up, it was clear there wasn't enough room. In the middle of trying to work with the staff to try and make space, the waiter seemed annoyed and decided he wasn't going to take any drink or food requests until everyone had settled in. Once we did order, the wait time extended past the kitchen close time so we're eating around 1030pm. We ordered the ceviche since it was late and we just wanted to get out of there- it was only chunks of scallops in some sort of acid-sweet juice. The chips served with it tasted like the oil they were fried in was old (they tasted burnt, even though they didn't look burnt). The view was nice but the staff seemed unprepared, annoyed and slow. Pretty disappointing for such a pricey restaurant."}
{"text":"The view is spectacular,  the grill is clean and comfortable with some elegant touches. The food is so-so and although it's overpriced, the price is acceptable because of the experience. The staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Our dinner reservation was for 6pm. We showed up at 5:30pm to see if we could be seated early. The hostess stated \"We will seat you at 6pm\". I asked if we could order an alcoholic beverage from the bar, she stated No, If you want a drink you need go back to the first floor & order something from the restaurant. So back down we went. We bought 2 drinks (Bloody Mary & vodkas tonic) our price was $23. We had to wait in line to get back on the elevator. We arrived promptly at 6pm. I again checked in with the hostess station. We were not seated until 6:18pm. There was zero explanation as to why we were seated so late and there were many other couples waiting to be seated for 6pm. The hostesses write your name on a small sticky note and they line them up and seat you by that. Finally, we were seated with many open tables and they were not busy.  Couldn't figure out what the delay was? We had 7:30pm ballet tickets at the Convention center and I knew we'd be late. The view from the restaurant was impeccable & the waitress provided top notch service. We mentioned to her we would be late due to being seated late, I couldn't finish my entree (due to time) so we had to pay and leave quickly to make it before curtain. The food was excellent but we felt rushed. Wished we could have stayed longer. When we left, there were around 10 couples waiting to be seated. The manager gave us a huge credit to our bill. We were very grateful. The hostesses need to figure out the seating situation - once you get seated the other staff takes over and provides excellent service!!! I would go back - but not on a night in which I had another event to attend."}
{"text":"The two stars was for the view which was amazing, the food however was not even diner level. 1 (literally 1) crab cake that was decent not bad and $20 , I ordered a bees knees drink and im pretty sure it was lemon juice and gin. Service was pretty bad and  I would expect it way better when we had two servers  If you want to go for maybe a glass of wine and not to eat but only look at the view would recommend"}
{"text":"It was a great experience for celebrating my birthday.  Everything was excellent,the view was amazing, and so was the staff. The food was delicious, however, my husband had the Compass Mixed Grill everything was delicious except when he came to the Cowboy Bean Stew. That just set the taste buds in a bad way. They were terrible. Everything else on the plate, The Lamb Chops, Day Boat Scallops, Confit Chicken Leg were superb. The Cowboy Bean Stew has gotta go. Such a classy looking plate until you came to the beans, it was very disappointing, the waitress had to take those beans away and bring him some mashed potatoes that were delicious  but other that. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"The last time I was in the Compass Room was 30 years ago, for my 8th grade graduation dinner. The décor was the same as well as the Wonderful food and ambiance. Very old school and delicious. Our waitress Sheryl, was so professional, knowledgeable, and kind. We always order calamari wherever we go and use it as a barometer. It was delicious, tender and lightly crispy. YUM! They brought us moist and warm cornbread. I ordered the lobster chowder and sea bass. Wow! It looks like small portions but, no. We were stuffed! My husband ordered the wedge salad and top sirloin. I'm telling you, GO there!  Prices are high but worth every penny in quality, service, ambiance, and city views. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for an anniversary. We were congratulated several times, and our request to be sat by the window was granted.     Service was great for the most part. Never had an empty water, never left waiting for long.   The only complaint on service was pre-bussing. I don't want to stare at my bread and butter plates until dessert, and I want my empty cocktail glass gone. (All were pushed to the edge of the table, too)    Also, the food was somewhat dissapointing. We both ordered the filet mignon. Nice size, cooked well. However, it was absolutely horrifying. Crusted in cappucino? No, just no. I figured it would be subtle, but I felt like I took a piece of steak and rolled it in a coffee filter full of ground coffee. I did my best to scrape it off, but it was completely penetrated. We both ate them, not wanting to cause a scene. I suggest you request the filet without the cappuccino crust. You'll thank me later.     Dessert was great, we ordered the banana cannoli. This was the best part of the meal. It successfully got the awful taste of dinner out of our mouths.    You are essentially paying for the atmosphere here"}
{"text":"It was my daughter's birthday and this is where she wanted to share her birthday with family and friends.  For some reason, even though my daughter(s) are very successful in their careers and make significant incomes; I still always pay. My wife has trained me and my daughters very well.  Julian, our host was incredible. The food was outstanding. The views were exquisite. And her friend was impressed. All in all, we all had a great evening.  And just a few moments ago, I got this text from the birthday girl to sum the evening up...  \"Thank you for a super yummy dinner, thoughtful gifts, and overall wonderful evening. I feel so loved and lucky to have such sweet and caring parents. Love you both!! Hope you have an amazing time in La Jolla!!  Enough said."}
{"text":"The view from the Compass is unbeatable in Phoenix!  I hosted a kickoff cocktail reception for my group meeting a few weeks ago and we had a great time!  The service was impeccable and the drinks were great!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and so was the service. I was going to a basketball game went there for dinner will be back"}
{"text":"The Good:  My boyfriend had the scallops and loved them. Although there were only 4 in his entree.   The jalapeno corn bread was delicious. Berry Cobbler = Yummy! Great wine selection.   The Bad (and why I won't be back):  I had the eggplant and was far from impressed.   There were three breaded eggplant patties layered between mozzarella cheese, yellow tomatoes and basil. The first layer was OK but the second two left a lot to be desired. The eggplant was too thick and was very slimy. I couldn't choke it down despite a couple attempts.  I was happy I had ordered a side salad and had the bread, if not I would have left starving. Due to the very limited selection of vegetarian dishes I do not foresee coming back. I would never order the eggplant again and polenta dusted tofu doesn't sound appealing.   Maybe doing an assortment of sauteed veggies over rice, or a grilled portabella mushroom, or frankly just about anything else that doesn't involve tofu or deep frying the vegetables. Not all vegetarians eat their meals with grease and processed tofu."}
{"text":"This place makes Christmas wonderful!!! Time spent with family over an  excellent meal. Never rushed by the super friendly staff!   This is the second year we have done this and it seems we have a new family tradition!"}
{"text":"They haven't mom a blanket when she was cold!Everything was pure bliss! Maria was great!"}
{"text":"Not impressed in the least. The best part of the Caprese flat bread were the tomatoes. Caesar salad dressing was bottled and did not like the cheese choice,  but the crouton was delicious. The filet mignon was well cooked, but flavorless, mashed potatoes were subpar, the asparagus was wrinkly, but the pepper sauce was delicious. Scallops were fishy tasting and had no crunch from the sear. The corn succotash was good as well as the cauliflower puree. There was only a small section of beautiful views due to big buildings blocking. Also looking at the roofs of the nearby small buildings was not pretty either. I would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"While not quite, \"all show and no go,\" the sum total of my five visits to Compass Grill pretty much follow that saying.  Yesterday was the least impressive dinner of all.  Unimpressive to the point where we are planning to cancel our wedding reception dinner in November.  Yeah, the view's really cool, no doubt about it.  A good setting for those celebrating a special occasion, or entertaining people who are visiting Phoenix for the first time.   Drinks were considered good all-around, and the service was attentive and friendly.  Pacing tends towards the slower end of the spectrum, which is just what I am looking for at dinner.  Folks appreciating a brisker pace between courses will want to look elsewhere.  Generally looking at 90 minutes to two hours for a full dinner.  The Zucchini-Corn Chowder ($9) was thought to be over-seasoned and not something to consider ordering again.  Not bad, not great...just meh.  The Lobster Bisque ($11) was tasty, and had a \"lobster\" wonton in the middle, which was a unique touch. I do not believe there was any lobster meat (perhaps imitation crab meat) in the wonton.  One other note - I did not see any pieces of lobster in the bisque...at all.   Our entrees were a mixed bag.    I ordered a salad ($10), with a portion of their Bistro Steak ($20) and a portion of their scallops ($15) to add protein to the salad.  The steak came prepared medium as requested and was seasoned well.  I'd estimate the steak portion at about six ounces.  The two scallops were frozen not fresh, but tasted OK.  At $7.50 per scallop, they've got to do better than that.    My fiancee went with the Free Range Chicken Breast ($27).  She regretted her choice rather quickly.  The chicken was maybe on par with the quality you'd find at the rotisserie section of your local grocery store - heavy use of rosemary for spices, to otherwise try to compensate for the dryness.  Compounding the problem was that it was bone-in, which at this price, I find inexcusable.  Finally, the \"breast\" wasn't all breast.  There was part of a leg and/or thigh to the entree, and not much breast at all.  The accompanying risotto was hard in some areas and overcooked in others, as though it'd been prepared some time ago.  It certainly wasn't made to order for our entree.   Overall, even at $15, this would have been a real overpay.  To the credit of the server and restaurant, the chicken was taken off the bill when we expressed our disappointment.  We did not prompt Lindsey to do so, so that was appreciated.  At this point, we no longer had an appetite for dessert, so we cut the meal short.  This was really disappointing, and has left us in somewhat of a quandary.  We'd like to have the reception dinner as planned, because of the views and setting.  I realize that \"paying for the view\" isn't a concept indigenous to the Compass Grill, but feel that the food lags too far behind the setting to justify the expense.  In this environment, it doesn't have to be great food, in my opinion, but it should at least be decent across the board.    Thank you for reading!"}
{"text":"We had received a gift card, so we decided to get appetizers and drinks before hitting a movie. It was really neat and we quite enjoyed ourselves.  We only had to wait about five minutes for a table and we got to enjoy the view as we waited. It is on the 24th floor of the Hyatt and rotates slowly, giving you an excellent view of the entire Phoenix metropolitan area. Their prices were not as bad as we were expecting, it averaged what any other bar is in the downtown area. Their Prickly Pear Margarita was quite delicious. Their calamari was not very flavorful, and I was not a big fan of the cheescake, but for cocktails, this is a great spot!"}
{"text":"The staff gets 5 stars but the food for being a Hyatt Hotel was lacking the lobster bisque was lacked flavor I make a great one but could not tell if theirs had sherry or cognac in it they also lacked variety would love to see small plates as well full entrees over all I think we where paying for the view not the quality of food we where celebrating two belated Birthdays no free deserts for either of them"}
{"text":"Amazing place! The wife, made reservations, and we ate last night. The location is breath taking. The food was amazing and prepared well. The appetizer we had was the papas bravos and let me tell you, such an amazing dish! The cocktails were nice and strong and the entrees were spot on. My wife did the filet with green chili bread pudding and I did the flatiron entree with mashed potatoes and green beans. The steaks were cooked to perfection and dessert was even better! We split the creme brûlée trio which included 3 different flavors of perfection. Traditional vanilla, Apple cinnamon, and Nutella. We also stayed the the hotel for the night which was a good call after dinner! Hands down, great overall experience."}
{"text":"Wonderful way to end my daughters' birthday celebration day! We ordered cappuccinos, charcuterie, and the flourless chocolate cake. All were delicious, service was great, and the views wonderful. They wrote out Happy Birthday beautifully on the cake's plate, and comp'd the dessert. We waited around to see the fireworks from chase field, yet they didnt do them by 10, so we left. We always enjoy coming to the compass room on special occasions."}
{"text":"It was busy but that was to be expected for the weekend after Valentine's Day. Food was ok. The steak was over cooked and the portions were extremely small. The creme brûlée was warm and the flavors were unusual.  The problem is that I received food poisoning after eating. I know it was from this restaurant because I had not eaten that entire day.  I was staying in the hotel and didn't not get to sleep the entire night as I was too busy stuck in the bathroom."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the revolving view and excellent food. Hubby had a steak and I had AZ Surf and Turf burger. Mac and cheese was tasty. Wine good too! Would recommend for romance or out of town guests."}
{"text":"Went to the compass room after the symphony, for dessert. Dessert was pretty good we had the custard trio- chocolate, honey, and vanilla. We had a drink each, service was great, and the view was nice. Dessert was $6, drinks ranged from $8-12."}
{"text":"Romantic!!!! Fabulous service! Great cocktails! Dreamy Ambiance!  Awesome food!"}
{"text":"Beautiful sky restaurant with mediocre food.   On the 24th floor of the Hyatt, Compass is the perfect restaurant for date night. The dining area rotates - one full rotation takes one hour - giving you a 360 view of Downtown Phoenix.   Between two, we shared the roasted beet caprese, house spring salad, pork belly tostada, lobster bisque, and the red snapper special. The flavors of everything, except the pork belly were a little off.   Burrata sat at the center of the plate, topped with arugula, roasted beets, and with what I think was supposed to be an olive oil drizzle, but was more of a pool. Beet caprese was an oily, mushy, glob of confusion. The lobster bisque was a bowl of extra watery fishyness. And for the red snapper special, it was literally a piece of flavorless grilled fish.   I gotta say though, the pork belly was pretty good. Pork belly was braised, cooked well, and had a nice bold, spiced onion taste.   If you're looking for a romantic date night with the views, this is the spot, but don't expect anything from the food."}
{"text":"Rotating resturants always pull me in and I hope that the food will be spectular and amazing. But it's not. I need to accept the only reason to go to a rotating resturant is for the mere fact that the place is rotating and there is a view of the skyline of whatever xyz city I am in.  I came here late night only to get a glass of wine and dessert. The wine list was actually quite decent, but the basic house wines were just-ok California large labels =(  And the dessert wasn't good. They used dried raspberries... Bleh, and during berry season. No excuse for that... even if it was the '$7 special'.  The view is great, but for wine and dessert, even in comparison to other rotating resturants, they could do much, much better."}
{"text":"The views and food are great! Service and desert could be better though. Nothing was bad about the service but we were never offered a wine list or asked for a drink order. This seems like a huge miss on the restaurants part. The black and white cake was dry with no flavor so we took one bite and left. This is rare for us not to finish anything sweet. We were the only people in the place since it opened early for the final four. Could not reserve on open table but did on yelp and it would only let us do 5:30 even though a hotel manager told us it would open at 5. I went to the hotel concierge to update our time but was told I would have to call once they opened because the concierge can not make reservations at the restaurant in the hotel. He also was not aware it was opening early. If I was a concierge I would call myself or use yelp myself for the customer if the hotel did not empower me to help a guest. Mind you he was not at valet or doing anything else. the elevator also did not work at 5pm so we had to get engineering to help us get up to the restaurant. seems like the hotel does not have good communication or customer service so just keep that in mind if you want to check this place out."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks fancy. The view was good. But the food was just so so. I had a scallop dish but I think the scallop is too salty and the corn rice with it was too rich and creamy. You can only eat them together. My BF's steak is only OK. The parking cost us 13 dollars for valet. It's not even count for valet cause they just parked the car in front of the hotel on the street. Usually these fancy restaurant should waive the parking fee even for valet. The meal were too rich that I did not want for desert."}
{"text":"Food was nasty to me but the experience was beautiful. I'll never go back again. Staff was excellent."}
{"text":"Great overall experience, service was good, food was good, view and atmosphere was perfect. The waiter said we were getting dessert on the house because we were celebrating our anniversary, however we got charged for dessert. Other than that it was great"}
{"text":"2 stars and that's only for the view. Maybe go here for a drink only to enjoy the view.  The food was really not good and very overpriced .... The bacon wrapped pear appetizer tasted old and freezer burned. The Chilean sea bass wasn't bad honestly   The wine list leaves a lot to be desired. The service was very good I must say and again the view was great but won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place is a great place to have a nice fancy dinner close to the Convention Center. It's at the top of the Hyatt and the entire restaurant slowly rotates so you can see the view of the city as you spin around. Unfortunately it was dark when we came, and raining, so the view was not optimal. This would be awesome at sunset for a romantic date!  The food was delicious. Everything we tried, we liked. The fondue was a wonderful way to start out our meal. The wedge salad was also fabulous. It comes with dates and apples and bacon - really a nice combination. I ordered the pasta - Truffled Bolognese. It was also delicious.... A nice earthy pasta with a hint of unexpected sweetness at the end. The portion was large - I did not finish it all. I would get that again. For dessert we had the black and white chocolate cake. Between two of us we could not finish it - SOOOOOO RICH! Wow, just one bite was enough!!   The hostess at the front desk was very nice and pleasant. She was great at managing lots of people. Our waitress was weird!! She did not make our experience enjoyable at all. She was like a robot. Plunking things down, picking things up. No smile or joy in her. She even sort of chewed out one of the other workers in front of us. It made our dinner sort of wonky, and the only reason my review is not five stars. When you go out to eat somewhere pricey, it's an entire experience, and she definitely was a buzz kill.   It's easy to walk here from all the major Convention Center hotels so that's a plus. We did not have a car on this trip."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends to have a nice dinner before our senior prom. We had a reservation at 8 and they made us wait about 15 min for the table which we reserved in advance.   The appetizers came out immediately but we had to wait A LOOOONG time for the entrees (30+ min). The food was really good though. The waitress seemed to have too many tables or something because she spent like half a second at each table before booking it. I would be mid sentence and she would just say okay and bolt???? Super weird and we had to call her back several times to finish a thought.   The view was amazing and definitely worth it, especially at night.   Overall, I really enjoyed the experience, the atmosphere, and the food. However the service was glacial. We were at the restaurant for two hours and we didn't even order dessert!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience. Went there for our 9 year anniversary. The food was great as was the service. The alcoholic beverages were very strong, which was nice considering an average cocktail was $12. But overall no complaints here. We have always loved the Compass Room."}
{"text":"The view, as well as the food, is amazing at this place. Everyone is really polite and they even gave my girlfriend a free dessert since it was her birthday. The only small problem is the wait. We had reservations at 7, arrived about 5 minutes early, and we were seated right away, but getting our drinks, food, dessert, and check took a long time. We ended up leaving at almost 9:30 but we would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to give this place a try because I've never been to a rotating restaurant before! And it is worth checking out for the views because the valley is stunning. We didn't get our drink orders and bread until approx. 25 minutes in since we sat down. We ordered our entrees as soon as our waiter came back and we didn't manage to get our food until 40 minutes later. During this time our waiter didn't stop by once. Our water was refilled by other servers as ours ghosted us. We asked for our checks and because it took him so long we made a complaint. He comes over and complains about how he's working as fast as he can and that he had a new system he needed to learn how to use and that we needed to be patient. No apology at all. He comes back over a solid 15 minutes later and SLAMS the checks on the table before handing them out. We were a table of 5 which according to the menu did not require the mandatory 18% tip which he added anyways. It's upsetting that our table of 5 where the average check was $70-$80 was forced to tip this man who didn't do his job at all let alone do it well. The manager ended up comping the drinks for us but only because we requested because the whole experience was ubsurd. Now onto the food. The crab cake appetizer was actually very good. From the flavor to the texture of the crab to the purée it was fabulous. The filet mignon with a side of pork belly braised greens is not worth your money. It wasn't medium rare as I requested and the greens were the incredibly bitter. So bitter in fact that I took one bite, spit it out, and didn't eat another. I left a good portion of my steak untouched as well. I would not recommend this place. I will not be returning. The bill was more than $80 and I got an appetizer and an entree with no drink and terrible service. I'm sure you could do better anywhere else. Restaurants like this think because of their specialty (the view) they can make people pay a ton of money for terrible food. Don't let that happen to you, unless the view and experience is worth it for you I guess."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate our anniversary. Beautiful views 360 of the city. Nice comfortable seating. We had the lobster bisque and the Brie to start and both were delicious. Then I had the fillet with mash potatoes which was cooked to a perfect medium, although it was garnished with some lettuce which was kind of wilted and sad looking would have been a nicer presentation without it. my boyfriend had the scallops which the scallops and risotto were great but the beets and goat cheese on the plate were not quite as great.  Our server Maria was very attentive and friendly.  We had the creme brûlée trio for dessert. ( hot coco, cranberry orange and maple pecan)  Overall a great night out"}
{"text":"Service is great, especially Jerry, she is fantastic and we have ended up with her each time. This place is great, you just pay more for the view, then you do the food.  I have never seen the place super busy, except for holidays like the 4th or valentines.  The food is good, but a bit overpriced for the quality.  The filet mignon is good, but not fantastic.  It is tender though. Like I said, you pay more for the view.  The Pork Tenderloin was amazing last night, the sauce and everything was super good, but the apple cabbage salad was awful.  Substitute it.  It is so peppered and there is hardly any apple.  I expected Sweet and started coughing and needed water.  I scrapped it off and just enjoyed the Brie Polenta and Meat.  We also got the truffle Mac n Cheese and that was fabulous too. Small fancy portions, good presentation.  Its just your typical fancy food, meat and potatoes place with a great view.  It can get a little warm with the glass and the sun hitting you just right.  It takes a full 45 minutes to go all the way around.   The service was great, the food was good, the wait for the food was a bit too long.  I think they assume from the view that you don't mind.  But it did take way too long for 3 medium rare meats. The lobster chowder is fantastic."}
{"text":"This revolving 360 degree restaurant is located on the 24th flr. of the Hyatt Regency Hotel.  We went for reverse happy hour and had the chocolate four-less cake with cocktails. If you like fudge, order the flour-less cake. Be warned, it is small. The restaurant has a romantic feel with a beautiful view.  For a Tuesday night, service was very slow. The name doesn't fit the restaurant...they might wan to consider renaming it."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first about an elegant/nice steak house being in the same conversation as hotel food, but dang! I am not a steak expert, but I am a steak lover and I had the best steak of my life here (the filet mignon). If you are visiting Phoenix, this is a MUST! The high-rise revolving restaurant gives you a 360 view of the city and beyond (pictures attached, but they don't do it justice at all). The corn bread and honey butter is mouth watering. All around fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lovely dinner at Compass Arizona Grill from a table next to the window.   Kim, the hostess, gave us a great table that we watched the sun set from while eating delicious dinners of salmon and chicken.   We like to go here for special occasions as the views, food and service are always fabulous!   We were celebrating a birthday and were delighted with the surprise dessert cake with candle!  Validating parking in the Hyatt garage is a bonus!    Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I went for my birthday dinner last night.  It was a beautiful restaurant with a great view.  Our server Karla was very friendly and on point.  Our appetizers, main course and desserts were amazing.  I haven't had this great dining experience in a long time.  We will be back again and I am telling friends about this place."}
{"text":"A little on the expensive side, but the view and the service is well worth it. My drink  was strong . Smoked pork belly tostada was great and the mixed sea food pasta was enough for two! And not to forget the delicious bread  with two different flavors of butter ."}
{"text":"Had a lovely anniversary dinner here in September in spite of Restaurant Week.  I say \"in spite of\" because I'm not really a fan of that week.  My few experiences have been at overcrowded restaurants with mediocre service at best.  But we bit the bullet and made a reservation anyway.  First off, let me highly recommend you try to secure a reservation on an evening when a dust storm is blowing in.  Assuming it clears out, all the residual filth in the air will make for a gorgeous sunset.  And like it or not, you're going to pay for that view.  Luckily, I liked it.  I started with a wine trio.  Honestly, I don't remember which one, but anytime someone puts three glasses of wine in front of me at the same time, we're off to a good start.  Then on to the Southwest Caesar.  I love a good Caesar, but the twist with the ancho caesar dressing and shaved manchego was a nice change.  For my entree, a scallop dish with a chipotle sauce.  I forget the name of the sauce, but it's a very sweet sauce, almost syrup-like.  Unfortunately, the chipotle did not come through to balance the sweetness, but the scallops were cooked perfectly.   I finished with my own dessert (I don't share on special occasions), the peach upside down cake.  I LOVE upside down cake, but this one did not live up to my expectations.  The components were all there, but there was no caramelization to the peaches.  And without the golden brown, crusty, sugary top, what's the point of the upside down?   So food was closer to 3.5 stars, but with the great view and fantastic service, a much deserved bump to 4 stars."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst dining experiences I have had in Phoenix so far. Let me break down:  The service was terrible. The ingredients in the salad weren't fully explained and when it came out I realized I hate multiple items on it.. I tried to find the server, but she never came back. My date had to awkwardly half eat, half wait for me. By the time she came back - she just wanted to clear the plates. She did bring out a different salad - but I was charged for both.  Our entrees were mediocre at best. Steaks that were over-cooked and under marinated.   We were given a birthday dessert that was nicely decorated, but then we were charged for that as well. This isn't actually a big deal, but I've never had to pay for celebration dessert at any restaurant before. The Olive Garden gives you a free cake for crying out loud.  That being said, the place has a cool concept. The spinning room in downtown is really cool. If you really must check it out - just grab a drink. The food is expensive, terrible, and will be served to you in an un-timely and unfriendly manner."}
{"text":"Ambience and Experience was really good,but food was average ,they need to improve the menu and taste of food"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed this restaurant since coming here as a child. Occasionally they will do a champaign Sunday brunch, that is definitely the way to go."}
{"text":"Had a dinner reservation to see the sunset at 7pm. Arrived at 6:45 to wait until 7:40 for a table. Many other parties crowding the waiting area for the same reason. No communication from managers nor hostess (whom was very overwhelmed and doing her best). When finally seated after sunset, must have seen 25 open tables. Very frustrating! Only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is due to our server. She was very professional, conversational, and accommodating.  I hadn't been to the compass room in nearly 12 years, and I wont be heading back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have a fantastic time, great experience here. The food was delicious , beautiful decoration & reasonably for the price. The view is amazing , super relaxing & silent atmosphere. Special birthday cake dessert was offer , customer services is above 5 stars. Super friendly & professional. Definitely coming back ."}
{"text":"The view was awesome and I can't believe this place turns while you sit there. The food is just ok. Mine was decent, the wifey said her chicken sandwich was nasty. You'll find much better food elsewhere for half the price but probably won't find as nice of a view of Phoenix anywhere else. Hope they revamp their menu and step their food game up in the future."}
{"text":"You pay for the view here. Not the food. The view is absolutely amazing and although a little freaked out at first, the revolving platform is pretty cool. The problem, though, is the service and the food. We were a larger party of about 10; however, it took forever to get drinks and bread although the butter had been sitting on the table for a good 45 mins before the bread arrived. I got the crab cake and mash and it was def not worth the price. I also overheard others in my group state that their food was just \"ok\". Again, you pay for the view here. Not the quality of food. A cool experience based on ambiance, but somewhat disappointed due to lack of prompt service and blah food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located on top of Hyatt Regency.  It is a revolving restaurant with an amazing view.  I was staying at the Hyatt and I had opted for to go.  I ordered the Salmon, which was delicious and the Creme Brulee Trio - Vanilla Bean, Green Tea and Pomegrante, it is to die for!!  Next time, I will have to have a sit down dinner to experience the true revolving feel."}
{"text":"Made reservations, arrived on time and was seated 5 min later. Ordered an appetizer, drinks, & three entrees including the salmon, chicken and a chicken salad. After waiting 50 min for the food to be served, I asked the server how much longer we would have to wait for our food. Ten minutes later, the food arrived. Clearly, our order had been lost. No apology or explanation was given. The Chicken on the Salad was very dry and there was no dressing on the salad. The other entrees were moderately acceptable but a poor representation of what should be served at these prices. As the room rotated it also became increasingly colder. Other fine dining restaurants offer much better food and great views in the Valley. First time to try this place after living here for many decades. Very disappointing overall. Sadly, I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"This restaurant is obviously breathtaking and such a cool experience. But it was very cold in there, which made the experience less pleasant. If I go back there, I would definitely like it to be warmer so that I can enjoy my time there more. The Brie fondue was wonderful, but it should be served with different bread. That nut bread is gross. My boyfriend and I both ordered the chicken sandwich. That should also be served on a different bread because the bread was too thin for that thick of a chicken. The waitress wasn't very friendly, and the lady who kept coming to refill our water glasses came around like every 5 minutes, even when our water wasn't that low, so it got to be annoying. We just decided to stop drinking it so we wouldn't keep being interrupted."}
{"text":"The view alone deserves an excellent review. This restaurant is located inside the Hyatt Regency hotel... a circular shaped building that spins (yes, spins) to give you a rotating view of the entire city. It's absolutely beautiful and the ambiance is incredibly romantic.   I ordered the Double Cut Lamb Rack and he ordered the Angus Ribeye. The meat was cooked exactly the way we requested... we both prefer medium and the chef figured out the perfect balance of not to bring it out bloody - but not overcooked either. We finished off with the Creme Brulee Cheesecake, some fancy chocolate cake and a red wine our server recommended. I definitely LOVED the dessert more... SO much so that he had to remind me how many hours we would be in the gym tomorrow. Talk about a sugar buzz kill...  The wait staff are friendly and consistently check on you. We didn't have to wait for water refills or the bill to come out. I was definitely impressed.  It is, however, a pricey restaurant (prepare to spend about $150 for two people) but I think it was well worth it."}
{"text":"The view was the best thing, the food was nothing to be excited for and nothing to rave about. i will not return. We came for our Anniversary dinner and were very disappointed"}
{"text":"As one reviewer put it - don't go there for the food.  Well, since it is a restaurant we DID go there for the food - and will never do it again.  The food was highly overpriced and tasteless.  My $39.00 entree was so skimpy I was in absolute disbelief, and aside from the tiny portion of lamb, the rest of it was mediocre at best.  None of my dinner guests thought the food was worth the cost - so despite the views -none of us will return.  Our server was boring, and somewhat rude.  Our drinks took forever to get to us - and we were there at 5:30 when the place was nearly empty - and when I ordered my last drink - she never served it!  Our dinner took at least 30 minutes to get to the table.  By the end of the evening -with 6 people - 3 who were not drinking anything but water - the bill without tip was over $300.00!  I do not recommend this place unless you want to get a view and a drink and then go elsewhere to get your dinner."}
{"text":"Overpriced food. Limited menu. The beauty of this place is the revolving views across the valley."}
{"text":"This is a high end restaurant that you should definitely make a reservation for so you aren't stuck waiting with a hungry stomach. The experience is really nice if you get to the restaurant as the sun is setting ~ very romantic. The food to me wasn't anything special that you can't get the same or better at a local BJ's which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. I also think the food is way to overpriced for what you get, I was satisfied, but not full, especially for a meal close to $50 a person. Because I only went in a party of 2, the experience was lovely, although for some parties greater than 2, I noticed their experience wasn't as nice. Their tables aren't large to begin with so if you come in a party greater than 4, you'll most likely have to be split up, which isn't what you want especially if you're gathering together to celebrate something. It was a nice experience to have, but I think this is one of those restaurants where you're fine with just trying once or twice!"}
{"text":"Beautiful views and atmosphere. The restaurant revolves to see all of Phoenix. I hade the pork chop with Brussels sprouts and a glass of Argyle Pinot noir. Hubbie had the filet mignon with mashed potatoes. Both are extraordinary!"}
{"text":"I would say i had the best time in Arizona in terms of the quality of time that i had spent with my wife. It was her birth day and we almost spent like close to 2 hours and enjoying the delicious food. Service was good.. We were greeted in the starting also my wife was happy as she got wish from the host for the birthday wishes. Overall i would say must go place."}
{"text":"The food (ribeye) was good, the service was excellent, and the views great. So why 3 stars?  Price. The steak was decent - about the same as an Outback Steakhouse. If you want a great view, then go. If you want good food, there are alternatives and you'll save a lot."}
{"text":"Great view and food! I visit once every couple of months. Food is a little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"For the bar only: sub par wine, but nice view. 2.5 stars  Cost to worth it rating: 2 ($18 for a wine flight; overpriced to supplement the view)  Highlights: - View: high level where you can look down upon the buildings of downtown Phoenix - Rotation effect: trippy but fun. After 55 minutes, you'll make the full 360 trip around. - Signs: every so often, at a spot on the wall they'd have a marker indicating what you were looking at from that particular view  Lowlights: - Wines: liked that they had flights (called trios), but oh dear were the wines bad. Between the hub and I, we sampled 6 wines and did not care for any of them.  Go for the view and order a cocktail. If we feel like peering over building lights, we'll be back. If not, we'll go for an evening drink elsewhere."}
{"text":"i loved the corned bread. the rest of the food was good and the service was great. since the food is expensive and it did not move me, i rated it ok."}
{"text":"Romantic with astonashing views of the city from a top of the Hyatt.  Food is top notch and a generous wine list.   What we ordered:  Flat Iron Steak Rissotto Cake Robert Mondavi Pinot Noir Creme Brule Trio  Our server was attentive and on point. Didn't get her name, but kudos for the service.  Note: the floor rotates and you'll able to have a 360 view of PHX. So, if you easily get deasy, consider this option twice.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's was a great experience the food, the service, the view.. Good times!"}
{"text":"We went here for our anniversary and it was perfect.  The view, the service, and the food was spot on.  We couldn't have asked for a more romantic spot or better place to celebrate 1 year of marriage."}
{"text":"Spinning and eating are not normally things I do together... Nor do I ever want to do it again. The only time I spin is after a heavy night of drinking ... And we all know how fun that is.  So the shtick of this place is this: it's a restaurant on a relatively tall building in downtown Phoenix that spins, thus giving you a 360 degree view of the area around the hotel.   But it spins just a tad too fast. You can hear and feel the gears of the place going, oftentimes creaking in certain areas. The central wall is painted one boring color of baby-crap brown and there's nothing on it but a hand rail (really?!) that looks like a relic from the 70s.  And it was freezing! Uncomfortable so.   The food was good. I had the salmon entree and it was delicious. Wonderfully cooked and a large portion. The appetizer was a pain in the ass. It was a pizza with cheese and mushrooms and truffle and so tasty, but the crust was too flimsy to hold the toppings, but cutting it was awkward and the share plates were too small. And there ain't no way I'm dropping oily mushrooms on this dress I'm wearing. I gave it up after the first slice.   Overall, a weird experience. The place was practically empty on a Friday night and because the room is curved you can hear mystery voices of people you can't see... Can they hear me?!  Even though I liked the dinner... I won't be back. Spinning around twice was enough for me.  FYI- one rotation is almost exactly an hour long. And Arizona is damn boring more than once."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The salmon was perfectly grilled. The rosemary heirloom potatoes were deliciously seasoned and just lightly drizzled with olive oil. I ordered the white peach sangria- loved it. We finished up with the black and white chocolate mouse cake!  Not too sweet but so silky rich! Delish!  The view was amazing!  Beautiful high rises, valley views and mountains views!  Great way to see downtown Phoenix. Very romantic setting. Best time to make reservations: Just a few minutes before sunset. The whole 24th floor rotates a full circle 45 minutes from your starting point!  Put this place in your list when visiting Phoenix"}
{"text":"You are paying for the spinning mechanism. Lovely view. Lovely atmosphere. Average small portion food for a high price.  I mean seriously, that really sums it all up. Come here for special occasion with a flare only."}
{"text":"The staff was great, they always made sure we were doing okay with out being too pushy like most places. Lindsey our server was fantastic. When I wasn't sure what I wanted she gave great recommendations. I go to a lot of restaurants and this was by far one of the best ones I've been to, and Lindsey was one of the sweetest, most attentive waitress I have experienced. I would definitely come back not only for the 360 view but for the service and food and drinks. You will not be disappointed in coming to experience this restaurant."}
{"text":"21st Birthday. I've only been to the Compass a few times before but I decided I was going to give them a try for starting my night. I ordered a glass of the Meiomi and my friend ordered a Phoenix Flirt. We also ordered the Cheesecake. That's all we ordered because college students over here. Let me tell you, the wine was amazing, the mix drink was great, and the cheesecake was just right. Right as we were finishing our meal our server came up to us and told us that they took care of the bill and to have happy 21st! The bill should have come to about $36 ish dollars according to their price but this is one restaurant I would recommend to my friends and family. The staff feels happy to be there like someone is taking care of them which combined with the food gives me much respect for the management. The view is amazing, go for sunsets and evening dinners (10/10). The entire place just has a great atmosphere about it. I will be coming back both while I'm in college (with limited money) and after I graduate later this year!! Thank you the Compass Family"}
{"text":"The service as far as hostess, server, food runner, was very nice and no complaints there at all. However, the restaurant itself, I was not impressed with. The windows were very dirty and had bird poop. And the food was too expensive for what it is. I went there for a special occassion and I am used to spending money for fine dining but the value of the meals at this restaurant was not good enough for their prices. Example, one appetizer with 4 shrimp pieces and some sauce was $18! I only had 1 piece as I did not like it. Second the lamb chops I got were not cooked as I wanted. I wanted medium cooked and they were rare. I have those boxed up so I will cook them more at home today. And third the cocktail I got I did not like, I am so not picky on cocktails but this one was not good. The name was raspberry raz or something. Bottom line, I've been to many fine dining places and this one I would not call one of them. The only cool thing is that it was rotating. So if the owners decided, they could use its full potential and make it a great place. I recommend to go somewhere else in the mean time."}
{"text":"We went here for drinks and appetizers.  Great view, the spinning floors took a bit to get use to.  Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Had dinner before the opera at Compass, made reservations through open table. Neither open table or the restaurant website mention that they validate hotel parking--so dont park anywhere but the hotel.   We were greeted three times at the host station before we were seated, which wasn't bad just weird. The table setting and dining room ambiance is strictly hotel standard--don't expect to wow anyone with that. Tired maroon cloth napkins. Horrible lacquer table tops. The average age in the place was definitely high sixties. The view however was awesome. And the rotation was slow enough to be peaceful and fast enough to keep it exciting.  The service was extremely awkward. It was like a symphony of the socially inept. It felt like the wait staff at Denny's somehow got their big break and had a five minute crash course in \"fine dining\" and ran with it. There were no specials, which was a red flag for me. And the first round of drinks came in glasses that were so water spotted and gross, I was embarrassed for the server. The martinis were watery and tiny. The food was acceptable but entirely unremarkable and overpriced. Pass on the NY steak if you are expecting anything thick.  This is definitely a second stop, beer/wine only place. Skip the food, skip the cocktails. Pre drink someplace else, show up here, sip beer or a bottle of wine [I would not trust a by the glass here] while you spin and get your parking validation."}
{"text":"Don't  waste your time with a full meal. Maybe go for just a drink and dessert to experience the cool revolving restaurant (however don't bring your own drink - this is a serious faux pax & they will threaten to call the cops on you) . Otherwise the food is not great and the service is horrible. Very bad experience. :("}
{"text":"I decided to come here for my birthday this past weekend. The reservation was at 7, we didn't get our table till 7:30 and our waitress was terrible! She was in a bad mood and was rushing us the whole time. I am so disappointed in the experience."}
{"text":"Come for the view, not the food.   I mean, the food is not terrible. It is just not $100 a person. The decor can use some updating, it is terrible.   The service is good.   It is a nice one time stop."}
{"text":"If you've never been to the Compass Room, treat yourself and go. If that seems too indulgent, invite someone from somewhere else as your excuse to visit one of Phoenix's premiere dining landmarks.  The Compass Room makes one full circle high over the city atop the Hyatt Regency downtown. The dcor is black-and-white minimalist with floor-to-ceiling windows. Of course, window seating is preferred and in demand. The food can be very-good or average-good, and the menu changes frequently.   But frankly, you don't really come here for the food. It's the VIEW. And living in a boom town like Phoenix, there's always something new to see. From 1995-98, we watched the BOB going up. In 2004-05, the entire block below was buzzing with little ant-sized workmen and a giant crane for major expansion and refurbishment. What will the view be in 2007?"}
{"text":"Had heard great things about the place but we where really let down. I took my wife for her birthday the wait time was not bad they even took us in early, we where asked what the ocasión was we said birthday. The place is nice the view is great the let down was our waitress she was very rude with us she did not offer us a starting plate or appetizer we had to ask her once we placed our order the tables next to us where offered. Also I heard a couple happy birthday cheers and a song we where not offered that nor where we offered a deserts menu I wanted to get her a small slice of cake or something for her bday what a let down. Paid over $100 for this bad service. On a side note the guy serving the water and cleaning the tables was very kind and nice to us always with a smile! Unlike the waitress who would not even speak to us at times when serving the food and stuff. The food was good!"}
{"text":"Don't go during a special event. Couldn't park at the hotels parking garage unless you actually had a hotel room.  Which is a block south if the entrance. Had to park at the Chase garage for a higher fee.   Arrived at 635. Had reservations at 7pm and hostess made sure we didn't get seated till exatcly 7 even though there were tables open.    The views were pretty. Table clean however the windows were dirty and you can see food particles on the window sill.   The bread given before main course was cornbread and a wheat role. Both very dry and tasteless.  Disappointed.   We ordered the chicken and fillet. Both entrees were good. The chocolate cake was also good as well.  Made up for the horrible bread."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Phoenix with a view that I've ever dined in.  And they do a reverse HH at 9pm! Date night is perfect here."}
{"text":"My husband took me to Compass in '09 for my birthday. It was a wonderful surprise because he had been telling me about this resturant since we moved to Arizona.   The only bad part of the experience that I had was the elevator. The way you get quickly taken to the top and quickly dropped to the bottom floor of the hotel caused my ears to pop on both our arrival and our depature from the resturant but other then that the food was great and we enjoyed the view of Arizona. We also had a very friendly waiter who made the experience wonderful too.   If your looking for something romantic and don't mind heights this is a great date night activity."}
{"text":"Nice views, great service! Food was disappointing. Steak was on the chewy side and the sides were over seasoned."}
{"text":"Amazing night. I took my girlfriend here to enjoy the evening and the food and service was beyond excellent. What stood out the most was the exceptional service from our waiter, Robert. He was super kind, funny, and even paid for a dessert for us. He was the best waiter I've ever received from any restaurant. Other then that, the filet migion was amazing. It was cooked to perfection and very tender. I loved it! Definetly a great experience with an amazing view as well."}
{"text":"4/4/13: 5pm Thursday night dinner, made reservations but the restaurant wasn't full. Restaurant rotates once around every hour, a little kitschy at first and queezy for anyone with motion sickness, I liked the overall experience! I ordered a pulled beef short rib cannoli covered with a mushroom cream sauce. A bit salty, I didn't finish all three pieces -sauce is very rich! Beautiful sunset from here!"}
{"text":"Days latter and I am still feeling frustrated about our experience.  I was part of a large group celebrating my friends bridal party.  The maid of honor worked so hard on planning and putting together an amazing night, and I hated seeing her taken advantage of, this place is terrible.  They originally told her $35 per person, app entree and dessert, then they told her $45, then they removed dessert.  Poor girl had to keep updating us that we were paying more and getting less, lots of pressure on her.  Then we get there, the service was inattentive, and unenthusiastic.  The meal consisted of less than one cup of greens, a small wedge of cheese, a bad dressing and two grape tomatoes as the salad and only option for an appetizer.  The pork option I chose was the worst pork chop I have ever had, as tough as possible and bland.  The mashed potatoes were dry, but flavored well, the only thing on the plate that was, the vegetable was three sprigs of asparagus and the sauce was way too sweet.  The portion was tiny.  The gratuity was added, as it should be for such a large party, making the bill $58 for a tiny amount of crappy food.  I love fine dining, I understand small portions are the usual, but they are made to perfection and satisfy through quality.  Not here.  The thing that has nothing to do with me, but still makes me so angry is our reservation was set for a certain number of girls, and some were unable to make it and didn't tell the maid of honor until hours before our reservation, the restaurant still charged her for two of the three plates for people who were not even there.  They sent it with her in a doggy bag, so she got food for the charge, but 14 girls were there, 14 $58 paying people, they profited HUGELY from our group, those two bills did not need to be charged."}
{"text":"I am giving this review 4 stars because the service was not top notch. The restaurant itself was beautiful, food was outstanding, however our server could've been a little more happy with life in general. She just seemed like we were a bother and was not happy to be at work AT ALL. Other than that, our dinner was outstanding and just being at the top of Phoenix overcame whatever bad service we were given. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to dinner the week of Valentine's day and made a reservation two days in advance. The restaurant definitely delivered with its beautiful scenery and a good ambiance and all though they messed up my boyfriend's meal, they quickly fixed it and were very kind about it. We absolutely loved it here and can't wait to come back in the future!"}
{"text":"We went to the Compass Arizona Grill for Thanksgiving. No complaints about the wait staff but then it was a buffet, how bad could it be. The restaurant charges a hefty fee for eating TG with them our tab was $ 190 WITHOUT liquor. ( for two ) The food was good but not ,memorable. Since the restaurant is upping the ante on price and food it seems like everything should be kicked up a notch. The waitstaff looked good in black shirts and pants but the host staff looked just above picnic attire. The view is stellar"}
{"text":"If first impressions could kill...   Glenn and Bri D. accompanied a friend and I to Compass Restaurant. After stepping off the fun (and I mean fun!) elevator ride up to the restaurant I instantly felt dizzy - everyone got a laugh when I instinctively asked 'why do I feel weird' - Um, the room is moving. The unease got better when we moved from the core (non-moving) of the building to the seating (the actual rotating floor).   The service was SO good. Our waitress was super nice and attentive to a level I'm not really used too, but I could get used to it! We ordered the prime rib and she came back so apologetic that she even let us order it, that she gave us two filet mignon dishes - which were really good. I got the mac n' cheese as my side dish, which had a sweetness to it - a unique taste, but not appealing to me.   The dessert was disappointing. Strawberry shortcake seems like an easy-to-please/hard-to-mess-up kind of dish...I guess I was wrong. The shortcake was dry and had no flavor, the tiny shot of whip cream was the best thing about it, but it was only the size of a silver dollar...sad day.   I have definitely experienced better food for less. The service was outstanding, but didn't make up for the lackluster in the food and ambiance.  By the way, I got even sicker on the way out and that stuck with me all night, making it hard to go to sleep :( No bueno..."}
{"text":"We were downtown to see Bon Jovi and to celebrate my wife's birthday.  Seeing the sunset with 360 views made an awesome night even better.  The staff was warm and inviting.  Our waiter Jacob was professional and on point.  The salmon and beef medallions were on point though you are paying more for the experience.  Dessert of the bread pudding was the only negative as it was over cooked, meaning burnt inside.  Jacob took care of us right away and so glad we came.  Thanks for helping us make new memories!"}
{"text":"The Compass Grill; don't get me wrong, this place has an incredible view and a cute cozy date night vibe. However, the food is sub par and the service is comparable.   The last time I went out server was impatient and rude. It seemed like she wanted to get us out as soon as possible to fill the table again. She rushed us in ordering, coming to our table five different times to ask us if we were ready to order, while we were enjoying the view and our bottle of wine.   The food isn't great. Overpriced and just not with it. I had the roasted chicken and it was tasteless and boring.   Probably won't be coming back. This place is a one time stop; go for the view but save your money."}
{"text":"In a snapshot on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being high and good: (a) Food rates a 7; (b) Service rates an 8; (c) Speed of service rates a 10; (d) View is a fabulous 10+++++; (e) Seating in the main Restaurant rates a 7, while seating in the Lounge rates no more than a 4; (f) Temperature FREEZING rates less than a 1 and is the main reason for the overall score above of 4 stars and not 5 stars.  Reasons for scores: (a) Food is a 7, salad fresh, shrimp pasta my friend ordered very tasty and generous portion; be sure to ask for the free cheesy corn bread appetizers and garlic bread sticks. (b) Service 8, server was attentive, smiling, friendly; (c) Speed of service; 10 very good, food and beverage order taken within about 5 minutes after being seated, food arrived within 10 minutes; (d) View, the best, 10 10 10, it's all about the 360 view of the city and surrounding area from the 24th floor, during daylight you can see the entire region, during the evening, the city lights are beautiful; go even if just for the view, although the only way to see the view is to be seated in the restaurant, so you will need to order food or appetizers at least; (e) Seating in the restaurant booths comfortable on a scale of 7, slightly padded chairs, but no high-backs in the booths, and most tables just use chairs; seating in the \"lounge\" earns a score of 4, it has the taller tables for standing or sitting at bar height, not as comfortable as the restaurant, lounge tables hard wood with no backing or arm rests on the chairs, more like a sports bar amenities; apparently they don't want you to get too comfortable; We sat in the lounge on my last visit there and I couldn't wait to leave; I rushed the waiter to bring the to-go-boxes and check. (f) Temperature was freezing cold; this was my 4th visit to this restaurant within 2 years and it has ALWAYS been freezing cold, as in shivering during the entire meal; I called the manager the day after the 1st visit and let them know my complaint and they said there was a problem with the air conditioning and they were working on, but I don't believe that because it was the same each visit. Next time I go (remember, the view is unbelievably beautiful, especially for visiting friends from out-of-town), I will wear winter socks and closed-toe shoes or ankle boots and a winter-weight blazer or sweater, a lightweight silk neck-scarf, possibly even fingerless gloves. The reason I gave a total score of 4 stars above is mostly because of the temperature and the management's apparent lack of concern about it or inability or unwillingness to fix it. I looked through other reviews and read other people also commenting about it, so it wasn't just me having a hot flash (never had one) all 4 times I've been there; it's the coldest restaurant I have EVER been in; I'm thinking maybe 65 degrees."}
{"text":"Goregeous view in the boneventure like rotating restaurant.  Drinks were excellent...food not so much.  Go for drinks...skip food."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our time at the compass room - food was delicious - crab cakes were good yet overpriced - you only get 1 crab cake for 17$ - the views were wonderful - there was a storm coming in and it was pretty neat to see - service was great"}
{"text":"A restaurant with an awesome view of Phoenix. A revolving restaurant. The food was also good. Celebrated my anniversary dinner there and got a complimentary dessert. I loved it."}
{"text":"We were in downtown Phoenix. I had purchased tickets for a nearby show and we decided to try the Compass Arizona Grill for our evening meal. The Compass was located on top of the Hyatt Regency and provided a 360 degree view of the Valley .... in what I understand to be the only revolving roof-top restaurant in Arizona.   Our visit to the Compass was on a Friday night about 6:00 pm, just after the Thursday Thanksgiving holiday. The place was not that busy but it was early and most folks were probably full & at home (& not ready to go out for dinner) after the big meal many had the day before.  After getting off the elevator, we were quickly shown to our table that was next to a window ...... that provided a specular view of the city. We did not know much about this place when making reservations. It took us a few minutes to notice that the view outside was changing due to the slow rotation. What a great visual perspective this venue provides. We later learn that it takes just over 1 hour to complete one revolution letting you enjoy so much of the Phoenix area during that period.   The wait staff was very good - professional and efficient. I appreciated the way the various servers covered for one another to help ensure every tables' needs were met quickly.    We started with wine and sparkling water. I chose a B.R.Cohn Cabernet from Kenwood, CA and my best friend ordered a Franciscan Napa Chardonnay. Our salads choices were the same - the Southwest Caesar with Heirloom Tomato, Manchego and Noble Cumin Croutons. Very nice variation on the traditional Caesar - I liked it a lot. The small (versus large) portion salad was most generous.    For the main meal, my wife ordered the Braised Lamb Shank which she liked .... Even the corn polenta and she is typically not a polenta fan. My salmon was disappointing. It was very much over cooked, consequently dry and the crust fell off the fish as it was served. We did not have time to return it to the kitchen (but I should have at least complained). Anyway, I would not recommend the fish --- based on this one experience.  We opted for expresso and brandy ... for dessert. A triple shot kept me going for the evening."}
{"text":"Beautiful views. Service was polite and attentive. We had two different servers at different points in the meal which created a little confusion. Two drink orders were requested and didn't arrive, but otherwise a great meal in a lovely setting. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner on the 24th floor at The Hyatt Regency Phoenix. Tthe rotating restaurant takes about 1 hour to fully rotate. The food was just ok. The desert was delicious.My husband had the banana cream pie which comes in a small mason jar I had the gelato vanilla which tastes like vanilla bean ice cream. my husband had the salmon plate. It was a small portion of food but he really enjoyed it and a green salad. I had the mixed greens salad and a Burger which was ok. the wait staff was extremely friendly ( shout out to Anthony our waiter).   the two dinners plus three cocktails totaled $103 all in all it was a nice evening if I were to return with out-of-town guests I would just take them for drinks and desert. Cozy tables for two and also there are couch style booths all of which overlook  phoenix  definitely a beautiful view. I'm sure since it's  located directly across from the convention center, there is parking but we were very lucky and found metered parking in front of the Hyatt Regency hotel entrance. We paid for 2 hours worth of parking which was just enough time to eat and get a photo opt to remember our date night."}
{"text":"Decided to go here for our 5th anniversary as I had always wanted to try this place and I decided this was a good opportunity. This restuarant touts itself as an upscale dining experience and the prices definitly reflect that. I immediatly noticed how dead it was on a Friday night at 7pm and that the decor was early 80's and a bit run down., it needs a major facelift., there was no line and the we were immediatly seated which was  good.  For our starter we were served 2 pieces of corn bread...it was good don't get me wrong but corn bread for starter at a restuarant that serves $45 dollar plates of food? We each ordered an entree and salad and a glass of wine.  When the salad came it was tiny as in literally a couple pieces of lettuce with some dressing on it. I was a bit disappointed for the price what I got  but I held on. My wife ordered the salmon and I ordered the pan seared chicken stated came with green beans, tomatoes and potatoes.  The chicken was cooked pretty good, but the Dijon mustard sauce was wayyyyy too mustardy and the chicken was tiny. The \" potatoes and green beans\" were about 4 green beans and about the same on slices of potatoes. For 30 bucks I woulda figured at least 5 of each. My wif'es salmon, a $35 dollar plate consisted of a small helping of rice pilaf and a very small filet.  She did say it was cooked well, but wasn't worth the price and the it was a bit run down and needed a facelift. My wife and are are not large people either and we ended up stopping on the way home for food after spending 150 on dinner, should have never happened. The food was ok, but not great. Go for the experience if u want, but eat first."}
{"text":"3 stars for the experience that was about it. Food is so subpar it's ridiculous. Calamari was limp, lobster bisque was bland, the scallop risotto was so smoky and definitely not cooked enough.   Service was good though!"}
{"text":"As anValley native I was very intrigued to try out the famous rotating restaurant. High end and delicious, the Compass Grill definitely compliments the guests celebrations and offers an amazing view."}
{"text":"Beautiful view of downtown Phoenix ...the service was very good...the food and price was great"}
{"text":"I was there for a private event, so this review may or may not be representative of non-private events, food, etc.  The view is definitely impressive. Many cities have a revolving restaurant/bar like this, and the reason is simple: They are unique and offer views that non-revolving restaurants don't and can't.  I would love to give this place five stars except:  1) It's not as tall as many other revolving restaurants. If I recall, it's only around 25 floors high. 2) The food was kind of meh, but it could be what our event planner ordered."}
{"text":"The view is spectacular and the food was very good. The filet was wonderful and the rack of lamb was outstanding. Service was marginal. From having to wait 30 minutes after my reservation time to get seated, to a waitress that was not as attentive as you would think at a restaurant of this caliber."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went out on a dinner date on Valetines night and everything was amazing! The food was SO delicious it was unbelievable. Our server, Jacob, did a fantastic job and made sure everything went perfectly smooth. It was very busy and it looked as if they were short staffed, but he was still able to give great service to us, as well as all of his other tables. Thanks Jacob, and all of the Compass Grill staff for the perfect Valentine's evening!"}
{"text":"The good: the view is good, allowing you to see 360 degrees view of downtown phoenix. Customer service is not bad either. Server was able to accommodate our request to split an order without paying additional fees.  The bad: I have tasted better food especially with their prices. Not to mention, their servings are also small. While view might also be good, the place constantly moving can be dizzying especially on your first time."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to the Compass in years. My husband and I had tickets for a concert at Phoenix Symphony Hall and thought it would be convenient to have a nice dinner and walk over for the show. We had a lovely dinner, the service was excellent and the view was spectacular. The restaurant was quite busy for a Thursday at 5pm. We are watching our carbs and there was no problem substituting extra veggies for the starch. It was an excellent choice."}
{"text":"Best views of Phoenix as the restaurant slowly rotates. with 360° view of the city. Be sure to make reservations plenty of time in advance.   The rotation happens slowly, it took about an hour to get back to the place we started. We didn't get that seasickness feeling at all. A must go spot for everyone who lives here.   The food was surprisingly good, much better than it had been on my previous trips. And they had vegan and gluten-free options to satisfy everyone. .  We went to celebrate a birthday. Everyone went home with boxes, as we could not finish what was provided. We had no room to order dessert which looked fantastic, we'll have to come back just for dessert!"}
{"text":"3/5 spins  the spot is okay. the promotional best drink ever is something you can pass on..the salt ends up in the drink and it's just seawater from there.  do get the brownie-brule dessert. it had a great tap, nice custard, and well the brownie goodness at the bottom. others at the table were sippin on disaronno, overall classy night. oh and in case you are looking to score over a bet, it takes about 55-60 minutes for a full room rotation, and i guesstimate around 60 window panels."}
{"text":"Bugs garner 1 star. That is dirty and careless. The rib eye was tough and the chocolate cake was spongy. The views are amazing. The server only said sorry about the bug and brought out more creamer. Not acceptable."}
{"text":"The Compass at Hyatt Regency has a lot to offer.  This is a revolving restaurant that gives you a 360 degree view of the city of Phoenix.  I suggest you ask for a wall seat for the best views.  The information cards were very nice to let you know what you were looking at from above.  I think this is something that the Indianapolis Eagle's nest should offer.  The food is good, it is on the expensive side.  The service is great.  Overall, I was impressed."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our dinner at Compass Grill thoroughly. The atmosphere of the restaurant is top notch, we were seated for our 6:30 reservation immediately, and our server was excellent. The presentation of the food was very pretty, and we really enjoyed the meal- our favorite item was actually the green chili cornbread served with the meal... and maybe the free birthday dessert my hubby got (the black and white cake- so good). The views were spectacular. If you're deciding on when to go, July- August during monsoon season makes for really amazing sunsets, and an evening watching that skyline is worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Came for cocktails tonight...the views are worth the extra cost..all seats are at the windows, so everyone gets a view. My raspberry lemon drop was amazing!"}
{"text":"We had a great time here. The staff was very personable and made the experience that much better. The views were great as we got there right around sunset. Little plaques on the wall as it was turning was a nice touch. The food was great and we definitely want to come back. It's higher in price but it's definitely a good place for date night."}
{"text":"WOW oh WOW ... talk about sevice and a view. So speacle occasion this is the place to go.  It's like everyone in the resturant knew us specipicly.  The Food was great a little pricey but I did enjoy it all. oh my the lava cke at the end was a great finish for two"}
{"text":"So, I  guess if it's a view you are looking for, then this is definitely the place, however, if it's great food you want, then I can guarantee that this is NOT the place.  My lobster bisque had hardened on top so that when you put your spoon in, the top layer actually wrinkled into the soup. My friend's shrimp was overcooked and chewy/tough. We had reservations and still had to wait 20 minutes to be seated. Overall, I can think of other restaurants that can give you great food & dining experience together. My suggestion is if you want both, then skip this place entirely."}
{"text":"Service wad very good. Food is good but not great, especially for the price. You are really paying for the view, which is great. Best to come just before sunset. Then you can watch the sunset as the restaurant rotates and then see the city at night."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there to celebrate our 33rd wedding anniversary. Very nice atmosphere and great place for special occasions. Really nice that you get to see all views of Downtown Phoenix and other parts of the valley as the restaurant rotates while yout eating dinner. Food is really flavorful and delicious. If you like greens I highly recommend their greens with pork belly. They were very spicy and full of flavor. Service was great too!"}
{"text":"Every 4th of July you'll find us here, it has become a tradition that we plan to continue for a long time. Watching the fireworks going off all over the city with a glass of wine and a good meal is a pretty wonderful experience. July 4th aside though, the Compass is a bit overpriced, the food is always good, but not quite as amazing as the price would make you think. You're really paying for an incredible (seriously incredible) view and a very romantic atmosphere. The menu changes frequently, so it's hard to make recommendations, but if the lobster bisque is available, get it. With consistently good service, three star food, an incredible wine list and a view that can't be beat, four stars seems totally fair to me. I can't think of a more romantic restaurant in the Valley, and even though it's a little overpriced it's still a place we love to go to make memories."}
{"text":"The view was spectacular!  We had tip to get a table on the outside even though the restaurant was not full. The food was fair. My niece and I had the filet. My husband the tips and my nephew the rib eye. My filet was very thin and over cooked. No salad was included. One side was. Mashed we're ok. Mac and blu was crunchy. The dessert was the best part. Gelato and the chocolate flourless cake. We requested a candle ( we were celebrating a big birthday), regrettably they did not accommodate. The bill for 4 and 2 glasses of prosecco was over 3 bills. Would not recommend for dinner. Too expensive for quality of food. Have just a drink instead."}
{"text":"The view is very nice.  That said, this is our second visit and we had truly hoped the food had improved or we just had an off night.  No such luck.  We all ordered something different and the only thing we all liked were the salads.  Wait staff was very nice.  If you want a beautiful, romantic place for dinner, it has that.  But for the prices they charge, the food was unacceptable.  I never mind paying top dollar for food....that is as good as it's price."}
{"text":"Yeah well. . . . I was reluctant to host a business dinner at a rotating restaurant (is that like inviting a girl up for a drink if your pad looks like Austin Powers'?), but I did it anyway.  Why?  Because my fellow yelpers seemed to think it a good idea. It was alright.  I don't think anyone aside from me really looked out the window and the food was okay.  They ended up hating my \"affordably priced\" $50 bottles of wine and sent them back for something more extravagent.  Typical.  The steak was delish.  And, here's something.  I'm not much for creme brulee.  It's a'ight, but my favorite part is always the crispy sugar top.  Well, with our fixed price menu, we got a trio of brulees; vanilla, chocoloate and caramel (or dulce de leche if you're feeling fancy).  Holy crispy sugar Batman.  I ate the hell out of those things.  Maybe their crust:custard ratio was high enough for me to enjoy them, or maybe they were really good, but; they were really good. I ordered a sidecar to start however and I ended up with a snifter of Courvoisier and triple sec and a small glass with ice.  Um.  Almost. Probably not worth the price if you don't care about the view."}
{"text":"Very disappointing meal. Steak was overcooked and dry. Mac and cheese was bland.  Service was slow. Seems to me they are charging for the view, and the quality of the food is secondary."}
{"text":"The view is great and that is what you're paying for. The food is decent the service is passable. You got to see the view at least once."}
{"text":"Amazing beautiful place everyone should definitely come here for peaceful very romantic place these yelp pictures don't do justice I promise you me and my husband spent our anniversary here today and everything from the 360 view of sunset to the waitress was so pleasant love love love this place me and my husband will be here again!!!"}
{"text":"So my aunt is visiting from small town Ohio and its restaurant week and I wanted to take her somewhere really cool that would knock her socks off. I hadn't been to the Compass Grill since it was the Compass Room like 10 years ago. But its a rotating restaurant and they sure as hell dont have those in Ohio!   I made reservations through Opentable and requested a window table for our party of 4, which was honored. When we arrived we valet parked because really where do you park in downtown Phoenix? At that point it sure would have been rad if they would have told us it was going to cost $11 to valet! I have valeted my car at numerous restaurants around the valley and its always been complimentary if you were eating at their establishment....Clearly the Hyatt nor the Compass AZ Grill believe in this. (Minus 1 star right there, its like charging a cover to step foot through the doors)   Service was generally pretty slow, and there were hardly any tables there, I am going to say that there were MAYBE 15 other tables. The food was decent but far from mind blowing. It was really pretty average and I am glad we went during restaurant week so we didn't have to pay the higher normal prices, because I would have been pretty upset over the meal.   We put our dessert orders in when we placed our whole meal order (You get 3 courses during RW) After our dinner plates were cleared it took over 20-30 minutes to bring out dessert, kinda crazy. BUT they were very tasty, I will give them that.   All in all it was an OK experience. I didn't have a terrible time but I will probably never go back either. Its cool to take out of towners to because the place rotates and you can see the whole city (Go just before sunset, its wicked!) Also as you rotate there are little plaques posted telling you about the buildings and scenery."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service and beautiful view. My wife Diana and I celebrated our 20th Anniversary and we loved everything about this experience. We highly recommend Compass Arizona Grill.       :)"}
{"text":"3 stars for the view alone. It's the best in Phoenix. The service was great as well. Wifey went with their Pork Chop and she felt it was a little dry. I had the Sea Bass and it was just ok. A really great restaurant with a spectacular view, but the food for us was meh. Not bad, but nothing to bring us back either."}
{"text":"I first went here for their Thanksgiving brunch. It was delicious. They had all of your basic Thanksgiving food with a fine dining twist. On my hubby and my two year anniversary, we decided to go back since we loved it so much. They did not disappoint! We started out with the braised bacon as an appetizer. It was delicious, and the maple grits it sat on top of were the best part. Then we had the compass bisque. It is a roasted eggplant puree that has lump crab meat in it. It is a must try, even if you don't like eggplant. They had had it during the Thanksgiving brunch, sans the crab meat, but still good all the same. For my entree I had the diver scallops, and they were perfectly cooked and delicious. Then for dessert, we ordered the custard trio. It had creme brulee, a honey date flan, and some sort of chocolate custard. The waitress brought it over with a little chocolate piece that said Happy Anniversary and she even put in a candle in it an sang Happy Anniversary to the tune of Happy Birthday. The fact that you get to rotate and see the entire city while you're dining is an added bonus! I recommend it for any special occasion or whenever you don't mind spending a lot on dinner, since the place is a bit pricy (but worth it!) I would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"The overall experience was great.  Staff was friendly, food was excellent, and the atmosphere was also good."}
{"text":"Food was good but appetizers salad and desert beat the entrees (filet mignon was cold, didn't like the sauce and the salmon which was recommended was mediocre). Service and views were amazing though!"}
{"text":"I don't mind spending money on good food. I love food, but here you are paying for the atmosphere and sub par service. The food was OK, but most chain restaurants can cook a sirloin as well as they did.  The view and appeal is understandable, but I wouldn't bother making the trip again (even for happy hour)."}
{"text":"Food and service was great. Awesome view over phoenix. Everyone must do this atleast once."}
{"text":"Best view, takes about 1 hour to see the ENTIRE city!  The menu changes seasonally and has something for everyone!  Want a burger, order one!  Soup, Salad, Vegetarian options, check.  Food is always great!  The servers, managers and staff are phenomenol!  This is an experience you should not miss if you live in the valley!"}
{"text":"I made reservations at the Compass Grill for my parents 20th anniversary - it was a surprise as I had invited a few others to join us. Overall, we had a great experience with the atmosphere and the staff was very accommodating. My only complaint was the food and drink. The beer was served warm a few times to our friends that were there celebrating with us, the mushroom pasta was incredibly bland, the vegetables were not cooked thoroughly, and the mixed drinks were also warm. I'm not sure if maybe the glasses had just come out of the dishwasher or what - but we had to keep taking ice from the water and put it in the drinks. Lastly, the staff at the host stand/answering phones were not very friendly and kind of rude in seating us and answering our questions like we were bothering them. I don't know if I'll be back, but my parents enjoyed their time - and that's all the matters."}
{"text":"I would say this place was just okay. The slow spinning of the restaurant is an awesome idea. And it's a very cool experience to be able to see all of Phoenix. The food is eh... the burger was the best thing we have had there with the bacon jelly on it. The mac and cheese was weird though with a onion ball type thing in it. Going once for the experience and views is awesome. But after that I don't really see a need to ever go back."}
{"text":"Overall, 4 stars because it was a good experience and a pleasant way to spend my last evening in Arizona.   It's pricey here, and the food and quantity that you get is mediocre. However, the views and the ambience is definitely a 5 star. I wanted to see the sunset in Arizona, but wanted to relax instead of  hiking during my last day to see the sunset in Arizona . Go during sunset and grab a drink, the restaurant rotates 360 you get a view of the whole city. Make a reservation via Yelp, it was super easy and convenient."}
{"text":"5 star all the way.  Totally recommended. Service was top notch.  Food was superb. We started with the fondue and that was great.  Lamb and steak for entrees which were prefect.  And desserts both to die for.  So highly recommend to everybody. Beautiful views as well."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is awesome! But I'm not sure the food justifies the price! We went there of our Anniversary and it was a good place for that but not sure I will return."}
{"text":"A tale of 2 Phoenix AZ stories:  Prior to Dec. 2010:  'hey heather, have you ever been to phoenix before?'  yeah i have long ago...all i remember was being in a motel with my dad scared to death while he watched pet cemetery. i was under the covers with my ears plugged and yet he continued watching it (wth dad?). i was probably 7 or 8.  'but what else did you do?'  no clue..thats the only memory ive retained O_o  (this has been my answer for years)  ---  After Dec. 2010:  'hey heather, have you ever been to phoenix before?'  yep! had a lovely time being shown around by my awesome guy...he took me up to the Compass Room where I got a panoramic view of the entire city during a full yellow moon.  It was really special :) And though more gushy a story than (previously) comical...I'm happy I now have this answer to share  ---  As a visitor to Phoenix, places like the Compass Room really shine to me. Beautiful, classy, iconic...this is a place to go for special occasions. Where *every* table is a good table to have a fantastic view of the entire city skyline while you slowly rotate around with good company. There are little plaques telling you what you are viewing throughout the time, which is neat.  We came around 9pm on week night during the holidays so it was fairly quiet and slightly atypical in social atmosphere, I imagine. Just for a glass of wine and a shared dessert - Bread Pudding (delicious). We were well taken care of by our professional and friendly server and had a lovely time."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience for our anniversary. Everything was perfect, service was awesome the food was cooked to perfection. Stunning views of downtown Phoenix at sunset are awesome. They even took the desert  off our bill, would strongly recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the view is amazing and totally worth it, but the food is great too! We loved the scallops and the steak. They mix it up with different menu items pretty frequently. Definitely will go back soon."}
{"text":"Great unique evening. Sunset was amazing. The wait staff was very professional and accommodating. Great evening, great food!"}
{"text":"Made reservations week in advance for a Wednesday a party of 3, asked for a window cause it was a birthday celebration.We arrived and no window seats were available  so we sat across the aisle. Luckly, the W i n d o w Table across from us was never used, cause they said they were\"busy\" and so our view wasn't obstructed. Our server was nice but not engaged due to all the tables she had to wait on. Food was not worth the prices they charge. I had the steak medallion's $35 for three pieces and some grilled potatoes $13. Easily I could have enjoyed a huge ribeye anywhere else. Bare minimum service, no follow up, just the bill.  The only hook is the views you get, and plan for sundown, cause anytime before you'll get blinded for 30 mins. If you're a tourist, it's worth the one and done...."}
{"text":"Had some relatives in from Chicago, I wanted to show them the best. Not quite the way it turned out.  Very disappointed with the food. I ordered  scallops,  there were four of them, somewhat warm, not much flavor. The first coffee we were brought was  warm not hot, we were told they were going to make more. About 30 minutes later another cup arrived.    A friend ordered the quinoa salad, very small portion, the quinoa was tough! Unlike any experienced before.     When paying high prices for food, I have come to experience the best. This was far from it."}
{"text":"Was looking for a restaurant in Phoenix, with a view. Found this place on Yelp. Met up with some friends to catch up recently and was very impressed with the restaurant. Ordered Hennessy on the rocks, and man they fill that bad boy up, only needed that one drink for the evening. That's PLUS! Ordered the Ribeye, with Brussel sprouts, wow! Ribeye was cooked perfect. Medium rare. Brussel sprouts weren't over cooked or burnt, just right, with caramelized onions. My favorite part is that you don't even realize the restaurant is spinning, that you get a 360 degree view of the city. Highly recommend to check out. It's a bit pricey, next time I'll just order the Hennessy on the rocks, with a burger for a cheap night, with a great view."}
{"text":"4 start for the view and ambience but 2.5 start for the food. The service was great but I was expect much better food.  Over all it's worth the visit if you are in town for the first time. It's very romantic at sunset."}
{"text":"As an Arizona native I had much anticipated this iconic location! A group of us gathered for a sentimental celebration at this staple and couldn't wait for the experience. We arrived early and to our surprise we were able to be sat early while awaiting our final guest. Sat about 15 minutes early to our reservation, we ordered a round of drinks to get the evening started.   Nearly 25 minutes later our drinks had not arrived as our final guest joined us. Not exactly sure where the bar is located, however I could have gone home for a glass of wine and been back in the time it took for our first round to arrive. Once ready to start with some appetizers, we decided to share two starters which looked great when they arrived. The lobster bisque was cold for our guest which was sent back and replaced with a temperature accurate dish. We're now over an hour in, and just finished a salad. This is where we should have ended the night.  For our next course we decided to order a bottle of wine, and a beer while that wine came. Another 15 minutes pass, no beer, no wine - and the wine we selected was unavailable. With no additional recommendation by the server, we had to request the wine list to make another selection. Still no beer delivered at this point, we chose another wine and I arrived shortly after the beer.   We were excited to try the Cedar River meat selection as one of our guests lived in Colorado and was highly anticipating a delicious meal. The group split two entrees when the ribeye was recommended by a servers assistant which we requested sliced to share. Once our meals arrived the steaks weren't sliced to share, and one guests side of potatoes was cold.   Beyond frustrated at this point with the timing of all of the delays and excuses (what turned into a 3 hour ordeal) we kept our mouths shut and continued on. We received the best service by a gal who wasn't even our server, great personality, informative and engaging. Our server did not have a professional appearance or demeanor, and we felt our party was an inconvenience to her evening.   The view and ambiance is not worth the price; the horrifically glacial pace of every course, the bread coming out after our salads, 30 minutes for a basic round of drinks, and no manager present to speak with on the concerns of our evening have us taking business elsewhere in the future. $300 gets you a lot in this town, there was not one portion of the evening that left us enticed to return. Having to ask for spoons for soup, fresh silverware, salt and pepper for a salad, sweetener for iced tea-this is basic stuff that I shouldn't have to request. This is by far the worst experience we have encountered to date."}
{"text":"I go here for drinks and to enjoy the views. I've looked at the food menu and it seemed expensive and because I don't have a bajillion dollars, I can't go here frequently, but when I'm feeling frisky, I put on a nice shirt and go to the Compass Restaurant. It can get crowded and busy, especially around the time of year when all the schools have prom. I think there is a two drink minimum if you're not eating. But whatever, I go to enjoy the views from the top."}
{"text":"Fantastic view of the city. Great service and really good food. Great place for a date"}
{"text":"The view is amazing. I went with a party of 5 and we were seated within 5 minutes of our reservation time. The restaurant spins at a slow rate but it was enough for me to feel a little lightheaded. The drinks were good and about $10 -$15 each. Our party split the calamari, watermelon brushetta, and burrata caprese. The calamari tasted fishy to me but the other two apps were delicious. Service was good but they did forget my salad. My main course was the filet with herb potatoes. The filet was slightly overcooked and the potatoes heavily salted.  The lobster from my cousin's plate was chewy. I recommend the corn. As other reviewers have stated, you pay for the view not the food."}
{"text":"What a romantic place to eat. I was taken here for a birthday dinner and was amazed by the view as we went in a full 360 loop around and saw all of Phoenix. Takes about an hour to go around one full circle and you don't even realize it because you are so mesmerized by the view. Highly recommend if you want to impress someone. The food was amazing and our server bought me dessert for my birthday! What a beautiful night."}
{"text":"View is spectacular, service great. Expected more from the food. The place needs a facelift and a good cleaning,"}
{"text":"Great views with very good food. The steaks are amazing cuts, however, they need to be seasoned correctly. The Manager, Billy, was great ... he stopped by our table a couple of times to ask how everything was going and to ask if we needed anything.  The server assistant, David, was also very good and friendly.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We made reservations for a party of 10 which quickly grew to a party of 15. The reservations staff was super easy to work with. This place was great, from the staff to the food everything went very well. If you're looking for a place to splurge on a party or date night, do it here. The staff was prompt, courteous, friendly and on top of everything. Yes there is proce tag to eat here. However I think its worth it. Between the staff, quality of the food and the views the whole evening was great.  The views from the rotating restaurant were amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. Im only giving four stars because the cocktail was a bit weak and the server went missing a little too long in between. But other than that this place is so beautiful. Photos do not do the view any justice and the menu is delicious. I had the salmon and my partner had the filet mignon. I would highly recommend this place to anyone celebrating a birthday or anniversary! Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant with no real expectations other than a place that 'rotated' and had a 'nice view.' To my surprise it was a fine dining restaurant, with a SPECTACULAR VIEW, and service was great/enjoyable (Patty was so upbeat and a great server in general). The atmosphere set it apart from any place I had been to before. Perfect for a romantic night with my girlfriend or a place to celebrate a special occasion with friends. Beyond the atmosphere and great view, the food was delicious. I had the NY strip and it was cooked just right. Everything from our appetizer to dessert was so good. Even the bread, which was a jalapeño cornbread, was great. Although it is pretty pricey, it's definitely worth the money."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this place 3 stars is because I love the concept of the restaurant. It has AMAZING views of Phoenix, is a nice relax/romantic setting and its got the spinning element which is different from any other restaurant in the sky that I have been to. This place has so much potential, but I feel lacks important things like delicious food. Nothing on their menu is to rave about and you think it would be when looking at the prices. I dont mind spending a pretty penny on a good night, but those nigths I usually leave the resturant thinking I ate pieces of heaven haha. Unfortuantly eating here I left unsatisfied. 2 stars for the food/lack of service and an extra star for the view and ambiance."}
{"text":"Took the family here for Thanksgiving.  What the food lacks, the location and view make up for.  The food and thanksgiving buffet were good, not stunning, but, good.    I feel the price was a bit high, but, overall acceptable.  Now would I choose this restaurant to go for the food, no.  But, to take someone and showcase the city, have a great social time... absolutely."}
{"text":"I thought I'd give this place a second try, due to some friends who were visiting and absolutely love dining there. The view is breathtaking, however, the food is not as amazing. I had the salmon with kale. It was quite bland for my taste. I've had the steak before and it was a much better choice. I'd recommend this restaurant  for a special occasion and if you've never been there before. We went on a Friday night, it's low key and a \"tame\"environment. Definitely not for those who are looking for a more vivacious atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great for dinner on clear nights...great views of downtown from the rotating dining room.  Dinner was excellent--pork loin w/ asparagus.   Good menu, solid wine list. Recommended."}
{"text":"If you're ever in Phoenix and want to impress someone or pop \"the question\"!  The Compass Restaurant with it's impressive views, atmosphere, service and food should satisfy anyone and everyone!    Recommendations: Filet Mignon"}
{"text":"Very poor service, food quality was below expectations.  View was great."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time for our 1st Wedding Anniversary dinner and I wish we hadn't. I chose the place for the view, which is beautiful. Our food was mediocre, I had the chicken and the risotto was a little hard and flavorless. From the time I made the reservation over the phone to the time I was seated I was asked about 4-5x whether we were celebrating and I told them our 1st wedding anniversary. I thought they would send a dessert or something, why else would they ask and keep asking? But nothing.  Our server was great and so was the lobster bisque, view, and tidbits of history on the wall."}
{"text":"Exceptional experience at The Compass!  I made reservations here for my boyfriend's 24th birthday. We were greeted with warm smiles as soon as we met the hostess. Our server was amazing! She was super accommodating and provided great suggestions when asked. I only wished I had remember her name to give her recognition, however the entire staff that helped us were wonderful. I had the salmon while my boyfriend had the pork chops. Both in which were cooked to perfection. The spectacular rotating view of Phoenix was just an added bonus ;) Our server also gave my boyfriend and I complimentary desserts in celebration of his birthday, which was very appreciated."}
{"text":"I debated between 3 and 4 stars but settled on 4. The reason I was hesitant is because it's a little overpriced for the food quality and selection but in the end you are paying a bit for the view and the experience.   The food was good, but nothing was great, and the portions are small.  I shared a calamari appetizer, had the salmon, and we shared a dessert and I still wasn't full when we left. I even had a few of their amazing cornbread concoctions.   Good but not great, I would recommend going once for a special occasion to see if you like it. We made a reservation about 30 min before sunset so the views were great and we got to watch the sunset. Once the sun goes down, the views aren't nearly as worth it."}
{"text":"First off, I'd like to say this restaurant was the most Romantic and unique restaurant that I've tried so far!   First time here. I was staying at the hotel which is the Hyatt  regency, and asked the concierge for a really good nice classy restaurant within the area. He recommended Compass and said that it was well known for being a\"revolving restaurant \" hence the name Compass. I said cool,  I've never been to a revolving restaurant before so i made a reservation for a party of  3 on a Friday night.  I went up to the 24th for where it was located and my oh my, boy was it stunning!  Literally when you come out the elevator,  you see the hostess on the left and the magnificent view. It reminded me a little bit of a new York view. That view at night with tall lighted buildings. The were a couple of sofas while you wait. It was packed though omg. I said thank God i called for a reservation hours ahead of time!  So we stepped into the restaurant itself and just when i thought i couldn't be more impressed,  i was. The place was incredibly charming and cozy. We were seated at a very comfortable booth. Our waiter was so wonderful and polite.   For starters , we  were served these  little amazing cornbreads! Soo so good. They tasted like ikea ones but Better and gourmet. the waiter recommended some surf and turf combo which sounded delicious till we almost choked when we asked for the price. We ended up ordering for entrées two of the pan seared chicken with smoked cheddar grits and roast vegetables and seared sablefish with sweet potato mash and maple balsamic syrup.  Food was presented beautifully and it tasted amazing. My sablefish was so soft. It tasted light and healthy. I took a taste of the chicken with grits and it was gooooood. We didn't order any desserts because we were stuffed from eating so much cornbread.  Overall, it was awesome. The whole experience definitely felt special, it really was. The ambiance, the service, the food, the rotating view! Everything. The price was definitely worth paying for. Especially great for anniversary and stuff.   I will most definitely be coming back and recommend! Awesome restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing view and original concept!!! Now that that is out of the way we can focus on the important stuff Food and Drinks. I am a foodie so when I go to a place I don't really mind the price as long as the quality of the food  justifies it. I ordered the salmon and risotto dish. Salmon was cooked to perfection, won't say it wasn't, but I was not seasoned. Risotto was gluggy and the chayote was not fully cooked. For dessert I had the queso fresco and churro cheesecake, it was ok but we all agreed the best part of it was the tiny churro ring it had on top.  My cousins were not impressed by the food either."}
{"text":"The slow rotating view of Phoenix are gorgeous. The food is tasty...although  pricy. Be prepared to spend a minimum  $100 for 2 with drinks."}
{"text":"I loved my experience here. The view is phenomenal and the service was excellent. I ordered the seared pacific ahi and my food was delicious. Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"Menu is well thought out - good variety.   The service was perfect: not hovering, but attentive.   And of course, the whole reason for dining there: the view - incomparable.    I had the lamb.  When it came out I was wondering where the rest of the meal was, but as I ate, I realized the rest was deeper in the dish.  Not a flat plate but more like a large bowl with a super wide rim.  And it was really good (bit on the fatty side if you're watching your cholesterol).  House cab was respectable, too."}
{"text":"Our family, a group of 8 had Christmas Eve dinner at Compass. The setting was beautiful and our reservation time was honored. The reason for only issuing 2 starts: our wait staff belonged in a much less expensive eatery, took drink order, came back 15 min later and took appetizers order, still no drinks. Drinks and appetizers came out but we still had not ordered dinner and had to eat our appetizers with the large bulky menu in our laps. Lobster bisque was good. Salads were very small. I ordered the Brie fondue and it was good except the pomegranates were bad, FERMENTED. Dinner was ok nothing great!  Not worth the $500 tab!"}
{"text":"Dined tonight, 11-14-17, which is a Tuesday. To start with I'd give the flexibility of the server 5 stars, but this experience left much to be desired. Me and my coworkers are staying at the Hyatt, and wanted to have a nice meal together while we are here on training and away from our multi state homes. We chose this restaurant as it's in the hotel, it's 24th floor in downtown Phoenix and I think over 1 hour you can see the whole city.   The pricing is up there, and looks wise it's nice looking, but it's not super fancy either. Being a large group and all needing separate checks, the server was flexible about this, so again 5 stars. It's also in his best interest because it's automatic 18% gratuity if you are a party of 6 or more, and with the price being higher, our table alone was almost $100 in tips, so I can't add stars to this experience, plus it was a Tuesday and not super busy either.   Tonight some of coworkers didn't arrive by 6:45PM, so we decided to go ahead and get our orders in, as we were all hungry. I ordered a 1LB Rib Eye which comes with 1 side ($9 ea - ala carte) for $50.  Our food took a VERY LONG TIME to come out, they were 8 of us, I ordered mine rare it came out a perfect rare. 2 other people ordered steaks and both of there's was overcooked. The flavor of the steak was okay, besides being cooked a perfect rare, nothing exciting about the taste.   Where the big failure for me was the brussel sprouts. He asked if I like them charred, which I said I did. There were charred but with a super sweet demi glaze sauce, they were so coated and gross, I couldn't only get down a couple. If you like brussel this is like a kid version that might appeal to child's taste buds, but not if your an adult who actually likes them! As Gordon Ramsay would say, \"I would not feed them to my DOG!\" They were cooked terribly too, boiled, and charred sweet saucy black messes. Overall, for these kind of prices, this food was a TOTAL  it's a total fail, I would give 1 star if the server wasn't flexible and nice.    So this restaurant rotates, and I quickly got seasick, it's sound really cool, but I hated dining there. I was dizzy and just uncomfortable often watching everything move just enough that you had to trick your brain to not see it, then you would again, I even put my back to the view within 1 minute of looking out, which obviously didn't help. If you want a view, just get a room on the top floor of the Hyatt, order to go, and dine in the room!   Getting checked out was a long process and I do give credit to the flexibility of the server, but it was 1-2 checks at time, just not great process. I was dizzy and just wanted to leave. I left about 8:45PM so this was a 2 hour dining experience from ordering. I would never dine here again. The only good news is our company will reimburse the meal + 18% gratuity, THANKFULLY!"}
{"text":"Very Disappointed. Took my wife and daughter to a belated Mother's Day dinner because we were traveling last week. I wanted to take them somewhere special for I decided on Compass Grill so we could enjoy the view as we ate.   We get there and we are seated a 15 feet from the window in an awkward one-sided bench table that made conversation difficult. With the reflections from the room and the distance from the glass I could not appreciate the view that we drove 35 miles to see. I asked the server if we could be moved before the food was even ordered. He responded that he would ask the host. He can back a minute later and said that it was not possible because there were no tables available.   During the entire dinner, I noticed 2 tables to the right of us that were unoccupied even as we departed. I also noticed a couple that sat up by the window and became uncomfortable with the spinning room and their server moved them to another table without asking anyone.  Never in my life have I felt I had to stiff a server but this is a well-deserved life lesson. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Compass Grill is always a treat. You can't beat the views, they are all part of the experience you pay for. The food is top notch and not outrageously priced. It's not an every nigh meal, more like a once a year meal. The food is ok, nothing really special, especially for the price, you're paying for the experience."}
{"text":"This was a great experience. The food was good, the service was even better.  The view was amazing, although I think I would have enjoyed it better during the day. Also, they were very accommodating by changing sides or putting sauces on the side and ."}
{"text":"Cold food, slow service.  Nice service and great view. But for the price, not worth the food.  OK, so we are in the desert, and I ordered scallops. But RUBBER scallops are NEVER ok. EVER. And all dishes came out cold.  The potato croquettes were fantastic for starters.  Go for drinks and apps and for the sunset view. Then leave and walk to the many great restaurants in the area!"}
{"text":"***Do not go to this restaurant***.    I got food poisoned from eating on this restaurant and nearly go to the ER. I was sick for 1 week and missed work for a few days.  We dine first in July 2014 for my birthday dinner with friends.  They did not serve the food until after 2 hours.  My boyfriend complained to the manager of the restaurant and Hyatt and they sent us 2 complimentary dinner.  On October 4, 2014, Saturday we made reservation and used the complimentary dinner.  I had scallops, lobster soup and ice cream.  The lobster soup what made me sick  because that is the only meal my boyfriend did not tried.  After 3 hours I went to bed and my stomach start growling, I just ignore it until 2AM I start going  to the restroom from that time until Monday night I keep throwing up and having runs.  Monday morning I cannot get up from bed anymore.  I had called the nurse line of my insurance company and told them what happened, they told me to try to drink pedialite and keep eating soft foods.  The bad thing pedialite has a very high sodium and after drinking 1 bottle it gives me high blood pressure.  After what happened to me I will never eat to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"One disappointment after another. Best part about this meal is the good, but expensive cocktails. The layout of the restaurant is bad. We had a group of 6 and we were split between two tables with a gap between them, which made it weird for a business setting. The waitress was extremely slow and didn't offer to explain the menu, the sides, or offer any suggestions at all. She wasn't very personable either.   I ordered the braised lamb and it was fall of the bone, but had a distinctive gamey lamb flavor. I ordered the side of roasted brussel sprouts and I was extremely dissatisfied. The end stem of the sprouts wasn't cut off giving it a tough texture. They were also burnt, passed what I would consider roasted. Nothing about this experience would make me want to come back."}
{"text":"The view was incredible. The fact that it spun 360° was spectacular. Unfortunately, the food was no where near as good as the view. The steak was mediocre at best and the service was average. We did have a great bottle of wine and really enjoyed the experience. When you pay over $200 for a meal you'd expect much better. The steak was no where near as good as Flemings or even a different point of view but with a similar price. If your going for the view and atmosphere just grab some drinks and skip the food. If your going for the food you should probably read a few more reviews first."}
{"text":"Brought my wife here for her birthday dinner on a Sunday evening.  THE FOOD  Our started was Bison Crudo, rather nice, certainly met my expectations. For the main course, I had a pork chop which was a bit dry but otherwise nicely done. I wouldn't refuse it if asked again. To top off the evening, I a Peach Upside Down Cake which was considerably larger than I expected and quite tasty.  SETTING  24th floor rotating restaurant in an area with barely any high rises... so yes, awesome. You get to see the valley in a way you can't see it anywhere else.  The sitting is nicely done in several separate compartments making it feel cozier. The rotational mechanism is a bit on the loud side, but not offensive.  SERVICE  Pleasant, quick and unobtrusive.  OTHER  Parking for a car higher than 6'5\" can be an issue in the parking structure near by, so if you have a tall truck, you'll have to find something on the street."}
{"text":"As a frequent traveler and a new Yelper there are thee categories I rate a restaurant on and they are the price point, how good the food is, and the ambiance (including views). Many times I find that a restaurant with great views usually is also expensive, but lacking in the food category. I can definitely say that the food was average at the Compass Arizona Grill while the views were nice. The restaurant is more of a classic ambiance than a modern innovative hip spot. I am a fan of Brie, so we had the Brie Fondue and unfortunately it wasn't as great as I would expect, but it was definitely average. For dinner I had the Jidori Chicken Breast, again the food was very average. Great presentation and naming as with most hotel restaurants, but the actual taste and love of the dish wasn't there for me. Again the food isn't bad and if you are going for the views it's a great place. The price point to me was on point for what you get (which is carried by the views, not the food)."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for our anniversary,  we had a great time the food was delicious only thing wish they had a bigger selection of food overall great experience"}
{"text":"To be honest, I was a little worried - being in a convention center hotel and was hoping that the place was more than just an amenity. I was pleasantly surprised at the food quality. The lobster bisque was great, the wedge salad was awesome and my filet was cooked perfectly (could have used more seasoning - but that is just preference). Oh - BTW - I tried from other dishes, so I didn't order 100lbs of food. The toasted, carmelized brussels were one of the best and they had a decent wine menu. As a cherry on top, you've got a great view, with a 360 degree rotation (about 45 minutes), to see the entire city. I recommend it, for sure."}
{"text":"When looking into this restaurant on yelp I was really iffy about going to spend my 5 year anniversary here because of the reviews, but I decided to give this place a chance and make a reservation.  Walking into this restaurant is a little scary because it's constantly rotating. The views are amazing as it slowly rotates for you to see the entire city. The inside of the Compass Grill is very nice and well kept. I got lost a few times going to the restroom because it's in constant rotation.  As my fiance and I looked over the menu I decided to order the steak medallions and my fiance ordered the lamb shank. I ordered my steak with a side of macaroni and cheese. For an appetizer, we ordered the pork belly tostadas. As our food came out the presentation was great, but I wish I could say the same for the food. The steak was cooked medium well as requested, but it was warm, the same with the macaroni and cheese. I was pretty disappointed my food did not come out hot. Same for my fiance's food it was warm. Despite the warm food we continued to eat and enjoyed the views. Shortly after eating and heading to my car I begin to not feel well, I'm sure if the macaroni I ordered had something to do with my upset stomach but it ruined the night.  I really wanted to like this restaurant but the food is just not up there. I would have rather went to Orange sky, or Donovans considering the price we paid for our meal. If you are a first timer trying this place just have the pork belly tostadas or a drink, the food is not worth the price."}
{"text":"I have been to the Compass Grill four times before this visit and on all occasions the staff was professional and the food was phenomenal. I expected the fifth visit to be just the same, however, that did not play out in my favor. The atmosphere was just as great as it was in the times prior and the food was not bad at all. The problem, which ruined our night, was our waitress. Note, I have always experienced professional service when I come here, (exactly what should be expected at a high end restaurant). She was absolutely rude, unprofessional, and unaccommodating to any of our requests. I asked for a side of mashed potatoes and when they arrived at our table they were cold and dry. I politely apologized for the inconvenience and asked for them to be taken away. She responded by saying, \"So, you just want me to take them back?\" I looked at her with complete confusion. She checked on our table ONCE throughout the whole dinner which was a few hours. When we received our check, the mashed potatoes were still on the check and I let her be aware of that and she got super frustrated and didn't even apologize, her response was, \"OMG, I forgot\". THAT WAS IT. That was the end of our night, she never came back to apologize nor wish us a great rest of our evening, nor said thank you. Absolutely nothing. She came back and put the fixed check on our table and stormed off. I will definitely not be returning to the Compass Grill for a while after this disappointing service."}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary dinner, mainly because we heard about the view of Phoenix and how the restaurant rotates slowly so you are able to see all of Phoenix while you eat... we ordered the pot roast, rib eye with blue cheese Mac and Cheese, calamari with a complimentary dessert of black and white cake(for our anniversary).. we really enjoyed the rib eye and I did like the Mac and cheese... the calamari was just okay nothing out of the ordinary, wished they had more calamari then fillers.. the pot roast was good along with the dessert.. i also ordered a drink here which was good but pretty strong.. so it was nice getting a stronger drink with the amount we were paying for a cocktail ... I wouldn't mind coming back here maybe when it's not as cloudy so we can see the sunset.. maybe try another dish.. overall I will give this place 3.5 out of 5.."}
{"text":"Believe the hype! Scallops as big as hockey pucks, the starters actually fill you up. My fish was done perfectly and seasoned to perfection. Even the jalapeno corn bread with sea salt was divine. The lady suggested a mascato for fish. So this place needs some training in the servers when making suggestions. A dry white wine would have been great. Desert wine for dinner? What is it with this generation? Anyways the place made me queesy rotating around. I'd go back on an anniversary. Place is expensive."}
{"text":"VIEWS.  This place was so majestic! If you are looking for a place to have a nice, quiet and romantic dinner, look no further !  The slow spinning restaurant atop the hotel was perfect to see the city of Phoenix. I came here around sunset time so it was a lot hotter that I liked it to be but it was well worth it. Also, got a bottle of wine-14 Hands Moscato, it was the perfect sweet wine for my friends and I. We celebrated her 24th Birthday here and had just a great experience! Thank you so much!  Also, word of caution that things can add up and get really expensive! But nice things aren't cheap :("}
{"text":"As a kid, I always thought this place spun super fast like an amusement park ride. As a grown-up, I was disappointed to find out it doesn't, but happy to find out there are some great happy hour deals here.  Happy hour is kind of at a weird time (9pm to 11pm), bu it's still one of my favorites. Happy hour features $5 desserts, $5 Canvas Wine (5oz of Chardonnay, Merlot, or Cabernet), $5 Wells, and $7 Featured Signature Cocktails.  I'm not a big fan of dessert, but I have yet to have a dessert here that I didn't like. The Strawberry Shortcake tasted exactly like a Strawberry Good Humor Bar... in other words it was amazing! The Chocolate Tort and Dulce de Leche were also delicious.   Obviously, the view is amazing. It's great to go at sunset, even though there's no happy hour prices. The best part of the amazing view... it distracts from the terribly outdated interior decor. You definitely notice that you're eating in a hotel restaurant.   I've also had some hit/miss experiences with the service. On my first visit, the waiter was nice, but awkward, and brought us the check as soon as he brought us our drinks. If I'm paying over $10 a drink (it wasn't HH yet), at least let me enjoy it before you shove the bill in my face. On another visit, someone in our party told the hostess we just wanted to sit in the bar, and she quickly snapped, \"Um, the bar is downstairs. We don't have a bar. Unless you want to sit in the lounge.\" The \"lounge\" looked exactly like the rest of the place except with an uglier tables and chairs. If you're going to be snooty, you better have something to be snooty about.  Still, for an amazing view, $5 wines, and $5 desserts, there's no place better than the Compass Room."}
{"text":"Views are spectacular!  The restaurant experience including the elevator, cleanliness, and ambience is all first class.   Service was good, not outstanding.  The bone in ribeye and scallops were delicious! The pricing is high for the food quality and menu choices but added with the view makes it more tolerable."}
{"text":"I have been to the Compass Grill several times before...the views are amazing and the food in the past has been just ok.  However, this time I had the salmon and a wedge salad and both were prepared very well.  I am a realtor who deals with lots of out of town buyers and always recommending places to eat to clients.  Originally had tried to get in on Saturday night but they were booked till 8:00 so agreed to do Sunday.  When we arrived hostess tried to sit us in table and not in booth as we requested when I said I would wait they seamed a little put off by this...even though there were numerous booths available she said she would have to clean it and it would be about 10 minutes...I agreed this was OK and just thought it was not like they were packed and should be more accommodating when there were more seats available.  Might want to rethink your seating on slower nights as they tried to get another couple after us to sit right next to us and they declined as well wanting a more desirable table."}
{"text":"I'm sure tons of people have already posted this before, you come here for the view and not the food! We ordered the Brussels sprouts and ceviche to start. Brussels sprouts were good... But not $9 good. Ceviche was odd, huge chunks of shrimp that were tough and the acid was a bit fishy. The bread basket with cornbread was probably the best part, as I typically don't like cornbread- this was awesome! For main course, I ordered the seafood pasta. Sadly it looked better than it tasted. The sauce was very plain, and it tasted like the noodles were boiled in the same water as all the seafood, some what fishy and like sea water :( the bread was probably the best part of the dish again. Just visit this place once for the view and it'll be sufficient!"}
{"text":"Good service, impressive food, incredible views. I was a bit annoyed that they didn't open until 5:30 pm. I had hoped to stop by right after working downtown, but had to go elsewhere first (and ended up missing the sunset). It's a bit pricey, but the strawberry and goat cheese salad as well as the flatbread I had were definitely worth it."}
{"text":"This was a great experience as part of our Spring Training trip to Arizona. We heard about the Super Moon and though there would be no better place to view it than from high above Phoenix.  We were lucky to get a reservation hours before.   The staff at Compass was terrific.  The hostesses at the front were extremely friendly and enjoyed viewing the Super Moon also. We were quickly seated and served a chili corn bread that is fantastic. They do give you the recipe upon request. Our dinner,, we both had steak, was very good, but also very pricey.  Yes you do pay for the view.  I must say this was a great experience.  This is a great restaurants for special occasions."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant! Great food & amaZing views!! Takes a little time to get used to the rotating but highly recommend this place! Tip: they give the best wine pours!!! Try the Riesling!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here for my birthday. He was taking me to the Chris Rock show so he made sure to find a restaurant close to the venue.  The Compass Grill is located in the Hyatt hotel. We got to the hotel and saw so many high school students. It was their Prom night. Brought back so many old memories. There is a elevator that takes you to the 24th Floor where the restaurant is located. We got there and was greeted by the hostess who saw that my boyfriend requested a seat by a window. She told us it would be about a 10- 15 minute wait since those tables are first come first serve. About ten minutes later she walks us to a beautiful table right next to the window. We went at a perfect time because we got to see the sunset. A older woman came by and filled up our water glasses, she was so pleasant and friendly. Our waiter  was precise and wonderful. We both had the mole chicken with mashed potatoes and mole sauce on the side. We also shared the crab cakes which was definitely our favorite! As for drinks I had a American Mule and my boyfriend had a mojito. The icing on the cake was they gave me a complimentary birthday dessert which was delicious!   The restaurant itself revolves and it takes an hour to do a full circle. It is definitely a fun experience to check out on special occasions or if you're from out of town. We do wish there were more food options, but overall it was a great dinner."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic time a few days ago thanks to the great employees at Compass Arizona Grill! The food and drinks were great, but the staff definitely made the experience for me and my boyfriend. We had one employee (I wish I could remember his name, but he had curly dark hair and glasses) who made a couple recommendations on drinks and then made some of the best mixed drinks I've ever had. He was very friendly and helped my BF and I out the whole night. It's awesome when you can get top notch customer service like that at a restaurant!"}
{"text":"I read a few unfavorable reviews, and I can't say I see where they were coming from. We went for my wife's birthday. This is the second time I've eaten here, but the last was about 3 years ago. First off, the views were magnificent to say the least. The staff was extremely attentive and polite. The food was delicious. We had the blue maza calamari for an appetizer. I had the lobster bisque soup. This would be my only gripe as I didn't find any lobster meat in the soup; however, the flavor was rich, creamy, and tasty. I had the braised lamb shank and my wife had the mixed seafood pasta. The lamb was fall-off-bone tender. My wife said the seafood pasta was excellent. I can honestly say that I would pay these prices for the food without the views."}
{"text":"Good food, great view, fantastic service. The revolving view is reason enough to go. An awesome place especially for out towners."}
{"text":"My husband took me here the night before he proposed, so we often return here to celebrate our special events together. In July, there's a good chance of catching a monsoon roll in with a 360* view and that is truly amazing to watch along with a famous Arizona sunset. The menu has changed over the years, so I don't ever get too attached to a certain dish, but I've always enjoyed the options I have to choose from. The staff makes special occasions feel special by raising the bar of service. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went with my husband for our first year wedding anniversary. We were very much looking forward to the dinner and he made it a point to mention that it was a special anniversary dinner when we made the reservation. When we were seated the server asked if we were \"celebrating any special occasion?\" and I excitedly mentioned the anniversary. The red sangria was good but the food was sub par. We were slightly disappointed that they didn't bring out any celebratory champagne or dessert. Usually nicer restaurants make it a point to celebrate with you.  The view was nice, The server was kind, but I would't recommend to any friends.  We ended up having drinks and dessert elsewhere and had a lovely evening after dinner.  P.S.  We had a 7:15 dinner and it was pretty slow for a Saturday night. Maybe other people are catching on that its only perk is the view?"}
{"text":"BAD and SLOW service! Food was ok, we expected food to be good due to the cost. The only thing good about this restaurant is the view. We got there at 7:30 pm and was out at 9:45 pm.   Salty corn bread, no wine cork service, calamari was fake and chewy, steak was ok."}
{"text":"just went there with my wife for our 2nd wedding anniversary. got a window seat. we had a great time,great views, great food too. (a little small on the portions) for the price you pay. but it was a very romantic dinner and the service was great too"}
{"text":"We timed it perfect. Sun going down, great drinks and appetizers, amazing filet and rib eye, then topping it off with the cheesecake and black/white chocolate cake. It was an amazing dining experience."}
{"text":"The worst fine dining I've ever experienced.  It's not fine dining and I despised having to pay for this meal.  Food awful. Service awful.  Waitress gave me a tiny wine glass for my $30/glass of Pinot noir.  I had to request the correct glass and then was refused a new clean glass for my second.  :( Very sad."}
{"text":"The view is decent, but I would say the food is subpar....I've had better at restaurants in Scottsdale. Went on a date night with my girlfriend to celebrate our anniversary and as a foodie the food was not as good as I thought it would be. Appetizer - veggie caprese was \"meh\" didn't feel like it excited my taste buds in the right way. I also ordered a beef stroganoff and although they said it was supposed to be \"hand made\" pasta, the texture of it felt weird because it was somewhat dried/fried on the outside and dough-y on the inside.   Service was good though as the manager there offered to take off the beef stroganoff because it wasn't good. We went to another restaurant after spending a short time there."}
{"text":"This is a one time kind of place.  It's a rotating restaurant at the top of the Hyatt in downtown Phoenix.  I've seen better views but its still kind of nice.  I liked that it has little signs on the wall with facts on them that you can read as you spin around.  It doesn't spin real fast but I get sick easily.  I did feel a little nauseous at times.  It takes an hour to do one full rotation.  My husband and I came here for our 1 year anniversary.  It was a Monday night and the place was packed and very loud.  The design of the restaurant enhances noise and makes it even louder.  My husband and I could barely hear each other and our waitress had trouble hearing us too.  She was very friendly though.  The restaurant had done one complete rotation (1hr) before our food came out.  I had the chicken cooked two ways.  It was ok, but it was not worth the $30.  Every entree is $30+. Drink prices are outrages.  My husband had a simple drink (don't remember the name) and it was $13. The Compass will validate your parking but it was unclear where we were supposed to park and we ended up parking in the wrong place and had to pay $7."}
{"text":"We recently learned of this restaurant and eagerly made reservations for 6pm.  As is our usual style, we arrived early but were seated promptly.  The view was absolutely incredible.  After receiving our cocktails, we savored the view only to be thrilled with the service and of course, our entrees.  We had 4 in our party and hoped to be able to enjoy the cuisine (and did we mention the incredible view) for as long as possible.  And we did!!  We didn't  really want (or need) dessert, but we ordered it anyway.  Again dessert did not disappoint.  All in all, we spent almost three hours at our new find.    Looking forward to another experience at the Compass Arizona Grill...soon!"}
{"text":"The view and everything is very nice, as well as the ambience, food was excellent, but my girlfriend woke up at 4AM with horrible food poisoning. We split the calamari, and she had the grilled chicken sandwich, which I even took a few bites of but did not get sick. Be careful of what you order."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful time here with my fiance! The food was perfectly cooked and very flavorful. The waiters were very patient and nice. I honestly was very iffy about this place due to many reviews, but this time I say otherwise."}
{"text":"First time here for our anniversary. It was amazing!! The rotating views were constantly changing and great! Service was very attentive. But the food was crazy good...the filet mignon was so tender and flavorful. We will definitely be back:-)"}
{"text":"The view was amazing as was the whole \"rotating\" room experience. That was the main reason I made the reservation in the first place. The food menu was secondary but based upon the menu listed I expected a higher quality of food. My whole table ordered at least 2 appetizers, 3 salads, 5 different main dishes, and 3 different desserts.  We all agreed the chef tried to hard with to many ingredients. The flavor profiles just did not work. It felt like if he had left just one of the ingredients off it would of been a good dish. Surprisingly my husband ordered the bacon cheeseburger which was amazing! I would go back just to order this dish again, he agreed! I had the filet and it tastes almost microwaved, was hard to cut (it was medium rare), and the taste was off. One of our other members raved about the pasta dish. For dessert, as a family, we love the creme brûlée. Once again they tried to use to many different ingredients and instead of making a \"classical brûlée\" they did 3 small different ones. Two were okay and the other was not what I would consider brûlée but they did have a sugar coating on top of it.   Overall the food presentation was beautiful, the taste not so much. For a table of 7 and a bill over 400 I expected much much more."}
{"text":"My fiancé took me for my birthday on 3.8.17. It was both of our first time at this restaurant. Our reservation was for 6:30pm I wanted to make sure we would be there in time for the sunset which did not disappoint! The view is great and even better when it is dark out and you can see the twinkling lights from the cars below.   Our waitress, Jerry, was very sweet! Extremely helpful, talkative and great service overall. We had help from another gentleman who would occasionally pass by and fill our water glass. Let me tell you our water glass was never empty it was his mission to fill them!   The food was good. It took around 30-45 minutes to get our food after we ordered it. It was a busy night but there were tables open. Luckily we ordered an appetizer that kept us going until our food arrived.  Our food was good. I ordered the Steak Medallion which came out very rare and I had asked for medium/well but there was no way I was going to wait another 30 minutes for my food if I sent it back so I ate it without complaint. My fiancé ordered the chicken sandwich and blue cheese mac & cheese. We aren't a fan of blue cheese but it wasn't actually bad.  We spent 2 hours there and the only reason we know that is because we went in two full circles (at 55 minutes a complete 360 degrees)   *************PARKING *********************** Downtown Phoenix can be tricky with its \"one way\" only, narrow streets. It can cause some anxiety if you are not used to it. We didn't really know what we were doing with parking so we parked in the Chase Tower parking garage which is north of the Hyatt. 2 hours came out to $12. However, if you park in the Regency Parking garage which is just south of the Hyatt the restaurant can validate 2 hours of parking where as they cannot do that for the Chase Tower Parking Garage."}
{"text":"The views are amazing but the food was a little too fancy for me and a bit overpriced.  Food quality was ok. I wouldn't say spectacular but decent. If you're a \"foodie\" you may really enjoy.  Staff was really friendly and they made our anniversary dinner special."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a romantic dinner or to celebrate something special. The views are amazing and the waitstaff is great. The menu changes every few months, which I really like. I would give this place five stars, but I wish they had more vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Truly outstanding. I felt like I had to try the revolving rooftop restaurant since I was staying at the Hyatt anyway. It exceeded my expectations. The service was top notch. My server, Sheryl, was very knowledgeable about the menu. Gluten free items were marked on the regular menu, which is convenient. She suggested the berries with whipped cream for dessert and it was perfect! I had a prickly pear margarita- delicious! Couldn't be happier with my experience."}
{"text":"The view is the only reason to go. Food was nothing special nor were the drinks. Our server was only at our table to take our order then never saw her again, however the lady who filled our waters and boxed up leftovers, was sweet and on the ball. I almost asked for the tip to go solely to her. Speaking of the tip, I wrote \"cash\" on the tip portion of my credit card receipt and left her a $20 on a $90 check. When I got home afterwards on that Saturday night, I noticed my card was charged an extra 20%. I thought maybe it was their procedure that the charge would drop off (even though there was only 2 of us). It's now Monday and the 20% never dropped off and the charge has completely posted. I've called twice with no returned call as of yet. There's no way she's getting a $40 tip on a $90 bill when my original tip of $20 was waaayyy generous for the service/subpar food. I'll update once resolved."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and service good. Great place to go at sundown and enjoy the view. Surprised I haven't been here before but would definitely return."}
{"text":"1.  Steak quality was poor.  Tastes like it was frozen.  Avoid it. 2.  Flavor of side items were bland, and over cooked. 3.  Corn bread was good. 4.  Service was par. 5.  Spinning nearly made us sick--the food didn't help. 6.  Not worth the money. 7.  Charcuterie was decent, but how can you mess up packaged cheese and meats?  2 people, no alcohol, 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, 2 sodas = $93 including"}
{"text":"We had the best anniversary at The Compass Grill. The food was amazing, the waitress was super sweet. And they even took care of our dessert which had Happy Anniversary written in chocolate."}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary, with a reservation. Not sure we needed one as there were a number of open tables, at sunset, on a Friday night. It's an experience and a good place to celebrate something. We were seated immediately and our waitress Karla was on top of things. As others have stated, your water glass is refilled almost as you are drinking. We had the pesto bruschetta, chicken sandwich and mixed green salad. We liked it all although it wasn't like the greatest thing we've ever eaten. Portions are decent. Her white peach sangria was way strong and we diluted multiple times. Luckily there was water. Wait, you need more? Here's more.  The whole thing is kind of pricey for what it is but it's not ridiculous. We saw the sunset at just the right time where we were seated, so that worked well.  We waited some for our check as it had gotten busier. I had put down anniversary on our reservation and Karla brought a berry cheesecake slice out, which was nice...we didn't remind her or anything.  Parking is a hassle. The garage was \"closed\" cause it was \"full\" so we ended up just using the valet, which parked at...the garage. You might be able to get your garage ticket validated at the restaurant for free parking but all our valet validation got us was $2 off the valet price, so that kind of sucked. There was no surface metered parking available right around there when we were there. The valet kid was nice but we felt a little taken advantage of.  Overall an experience and decent food, paying to watch the sun go down in a high air conditioned room in the middle of summertime in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I've wanted to go here since I was young and we finally made reservations and went.    The view was great except the windows were pretty dirty.  The service was nice and when we first got there it was early enough it was still pretty empty.  Our first issue was that the item we wanted to order that we had seen on the web site menu wasn't available.  My girlfriend ordered one of the only other vegetarian items and it ended up being nothing as described.  It's first ingredient was eggplant but it only had a very paper thin layer of eggplant on the top.    The food was OK at the time, but both my girlfriend and I were pretty sick within an hour or two of eating there.  We would have given two stars but the endless bread was good and they got an extra star for that."}
{"text":"The view is absolutely amazing, get there at sunset it is breathtaking. The eggplant bisque was beyond delicious and they even gave me the recipe. The seared scallops with squash succotash and peas was to die for. It was definitely a return venue for me."}
{"text":"Well the view is obvious.  I mean - it is decently high up and gives you a good view of downtown but, I don't know - the view from the Arizona Club is better.    We went here after watching a show at the Herberger and I was expecting some high class expensive dining that that is exactly what I got.  The service matched the price tag which was nice to see but the restaurant itself was disappointing.  Not only did they not have Coke or dark rum but they let poor Ashley A order a prime rib and then told her they were all out.    I had the drunken shrimp and they were pretty excellent.  The sauce around them was really good and they were resting on a piece of toast disguised as a crostini.  I also had a few bites of the lava cake but since it was buried under a pound of powered sugar, I couldn't eat any more.  I guess I just agree with Beth S's review...I'm just not seeing what justifies the price.  The District in the Sheraton next door is a restaurant in a hotel that has amazing food that is priced better than this.  Plus, the view there isn't half bad."}
{"text":"I have been taking people here for 25 years. From celebrating a special occasion to taking my sons teachers there to wish them well on their retirement to taking our out of town visitors out for a Sunday brunch they will never forget- this is the place. You can't beat the view day or night."}
{"text":"Turned out to be an amazing dinner date. The place was perfect, the view was just amazing. This restaurant is just a gem in the middle of the desert. Icing on the cake is the service. JACOB our waiter was amazing at his service n many a times he went a step ahead to serve n make us happy. 10 on 10. Coming to the menu n food. Little pricey so watch out but worth paying for all the things ur getting. We had wine, lamb chops n sandwich. Chops just blew my mind. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"To summarize: Beautiful view Fair food with skimpy portions  Poor service Way overpriced Maybe OK for a one time stop but definitely not a revisit  My wife and I had never been there so we thought we would give it a try as we had tickets to Symphony Hall for a 7:30 show. We were seated a few minutes after six. We ordered from the theater menu to save some time as the staff recommended. Needless to say, our cocktails were watered down too much, the appetizers were well under portioned and the Salmon took over one hour to prepare and it was thrown over some cauliflower; not exactly a wonderful presentation !  We originally ordered from the pre fixe menu which included a desert but since time became a significant factor, we cancelled it.  My wife and I had to eat quickly, pay as we were eating and get over to Symphony Hall ; we were able to get to the venue at 7:20 because thankfully it was across the street.  Needless to say, the show made the night, not the restaurant."}
{"text":"It was a great experience from outset. We had considered going there previously but the price when coupled with the totality of reviews left us with some anxiety. Christmas seemed to be the day to cast the concerns to the wind and go anyway and i am glad we did.   The experience was awesome and the service and food were consistent with the best of prior reviews we had read. The view and atmosphere only enhanced the food. I particularly enjoyed the grilled beets and crab/oyster selection. There were 4 people in our party (each with different food tastes and interests) but there seemed to be a favorite for everyone.  It was still expensive but as a once a year trip, well worth it."}
{"text":"I recently went to dinner with a date at Compass and the experience was amazing. The food was delicious and the views were fantastic. There was even an Arizona Diamondbacks game that had just ended and there were fireworks to end the night. It made the night even more romantic. Our server Lindsey was even better than the views. She was so sweet and answered all of our questions. She even told us about some fun places to go after dinner for some drinks. She also went out of her way to make sure that our experience was memorable. If you are looking for a place to take a date, this is it. If you get Lindsey as your server, then you are guaranteed to have an unforgettable experience. Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Part of my mediocre experience may be due to the fact that everyone raves about this place and I didn't think it was a must-see. I'll admit that the concept of a revolving 24th floor to see the entire Downtown Phoenix is pretty cool. I also enjoyed the random fact placards that were on the walls as the floor rotated.  We came here for drinks in the afternoon. The drink menu wasn't very extensive and made with non-top shelf liquor. We also ordered the pear arugula pancetta flatbread to share, which was actually pretty good. As far as prices go, pretty steep at $12 per drink and for the flatbread, but no big.  Definitely a place of novelty, but again, could have survived my trip without having to visit this place."}
{"text":"Basically the waiter ruined the experience. First steaks could not be ordered as we wanted.  All of them came out well done! For a filet! I would never return it is not worth it."}
{"text":"good seats. plenty tv. not many healthy food options but salads. Staff cool.  was packed 6-8pm then died hard"}
{"text":"Surprising Good food by a restuarant one would expect to highlight view and little else.  Great Veal Chop and Excellent Service."}
{"text":"The view was awesome! The waiters were really nice and helpful. The food was ok, my had salmon and I had the filet."}
{"text":"I should have listened to the poor reviews on here. It is a cool concept so for the views I imagine bring the crowds.. plus maybe gets the hotel bring a steady flow?   My filet mignon was ordered medium but came well done- had to send it back but still wasn't medium. The cocktail was wayy too sweet. The service was bad- server wasn't friendly, had to wait along time to get checked up on. Another waiter that wrapped up my left overs placed the box on the floor beside me saying 'I'll just leave this right here for you' - who puts food on the floor ?? They need to train better.   Bottom line- if you come here for views- chose maybe an easy desert that they can't mess up plus wine ."}
{"text":"Beautiful scenery of Phoenix. The food was delicious but a little pricey. Overall my beautiful wife and I enjoyed our date night here."}
{"text":"Food.  Awesome.  Service.  Awesome (Patty).  Ambience.  Awesome. Temperature.  SUCKED!  I froze through half my meal.  When I mentioned it to Patty, she said it happens at that part of the rotation.  For $80 a head (at least!)  you'd think they could take care of that!"}
{"text":"This place has a special spot in my heart because I'm sure like many yelpers or guest that visit the compass grill, they've shared a special moment here. My first time visiting the compass grill, my boyfriend surprised me with a nice dinner with my promotion at work, absolutely fell in love with the food and ambiance, enjoyed scallops and red snapper with pork belly and risotto, what a treat. We promised each other we would go back for 4th of July and watch the fireworks. We called and made reservations but they were booked, well the day of the 4th, they called and had a spot for us, yay!! Well looking over the fireworks and enjoying crab cakes and some wine, My boyfriend got down on one knee and proposed and it was very intimate and special. The staff were so accommodating with complimentary champagne and dessert. This is our go to special place. :-)"}
{"text":"We had a bit of challenge in getting a reservation on a Saturday night. When I called, I was told there were no available tables. Then I tried making an on-line reservation: Success!   The Compass Arizona Grill, like the Hyatt, is somewhat retro. Do they even build revolving restaurants anymore? It really seems like something from the 60s or 70s.   Not sure it is something I would want to do every Saturday night. But it was a good way to relax after a day of traveling. We had more than a full revolution and had a good view of downtown Phoenix -- plus the sunset.  We began our meal with a bottle of cabernet sauvignon and a bread basket which featured two seeded buns and three mini loaves of cornbread. Butter and honey butter were good complements. DH thoroughly enjoyed his entree: three small beef medallions with a side of roasted brussels sprouts. I ordered one of the specials: a Moroccan dish with couscous and peppers, topped with mahi mahi. Sounded intriguing. The portion of fish was quite large -- I had to push myself to finish it. For me, chicken or lamb would have been a better choice than the fish. The couscous was a bit on the cool side and didn't have much of a \"zip\" to it -- needed more spices.  We ended our meal with a delicious cherry tart served with vanilla ice cream. It was quite lovely ... not too tart, not too sweet. The generous portion was perfect for sharing.  Jacob was our server ... helpful, yet not overly intrusive. All in all Compass Arizona Grill was a good option. Worth trying at least once when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"When working downtown, this was a great \"impress out of town clients\" kind of place for lunch.  The food was always quite nice, but only because I wasn't paying.  For the price, and if impressing snooty clients wasn't involved, I would have most likely gone elsewhere.    IMHO, the best times to go are 1) Dessert and 2) Brunch.  Desert here is quite yummy, and you don't mind so much paying a bit more for a cake and coffee when you get the impeccable service, the upscale look and the ever so amazing city lights.  Brunch here is my favorite place to take folks who are visiting Phoenix.  I get teased a bit by family and friends that I'm the un-official Phoenix historical society because of how much I love pointing out Phoenix landmarks and telling everyone tidbits from their cool history.  Everyone has fun pointing out where their house is, where they went last night and were they are going on their sight seeing mission later that day.  It's also a great place to see how big Phoenix really is.  (Best spot - South Mountain) One full rotation takes about an hour, and there are plaques up around the place to tell you what building or mountain range is right in front of you.    Oh yea, the food.  It's good.  I know food shouldn't be secondary, but here it really is.  They always have a nice selection of cold seafood, pot stickers & sushi, bagels & muffins, fruit, omelets and waffles, and of course a nice selection of desserts. Of course Juice and Champagne are always included.  It's good, and you'll leave full, but the final impression will be in the view, not in the food.  And here, I think that's really as it should be."}
{"text":"We had an amazing anniversary experience! The reservation was smooth and simple. Everyone was kind and the food was delicious. We loved the revolving views."}
{"text":"The view is breathtaking from this place.  We attended a business dinner here, and it offers a great view of Phoenix.  Plus the restaurant rotates so you can see the entire city without having to leave your seat.  The food was very good as well.  Great spot for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Over rated. I'm gluten free for medical reasons. Those reasons being I get food poisoning like symptoms when I consume too much gluten.   I ordered the Fondue appetizer and asked for veggies to go with it as a substitution. I don't think my waitress understood this. Which caused me to have to remind her AGAIN when the appetizer came out.   There were only a handful of meal options, so I went with a salad which had delicious candied almonds. It is sad when that is the highlight of a meal.   The service was horrible. We had an appetizer, two well drinks, two salads and our bill was almost $70.   The worst part of the experience is that I have been sick for 12 hours after leaving there. If you have a gluten issue I would highly recommend not going to this place."}
{"text":"I haven't written a review before, so I'm not sure how to organize this. Let's go with the traditional:  Pros: - The view. You will probably do just more than a full rotation during one dinner. - The servers were kind and attentive.  Cons: - Overpriced. - Food was brought out very slowly. - If you don't want steak, there isn't much variety on the menu. - The food was poor (and in my case, severely undercooked).   The location is great, but as soon as I saw the prices, I was ready for them to be justified. To say that the prices were NOT justified is to put it mildly. The food consisted of pretentious ideas or simple cuts of meat that were executed at or below an Applebee's level. I had the salmon, and there was absolutely nothing notable about the dish or plating except for an unnecessarily huge glob of butter sitting on the fish, which turned out to be almost completely uncooked. It was uncooked fish, some butter, and some average-tasting pilaf. Comments around the table made it apparent that the other dishes were of similar quality.  Overall: there isn't much of a point to this place. The view is the view, if that's your thing, then wander up and buy a drink, I guess. Do not eat here, it is an egregious, almost inexcusable waste of money. I would have been kinder if the prices did not imply that we should expect utter brilliance."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Pricey, but you should go at least once, at night. The moving dining room is cool. The food was great. Large dishes, small portions, as to be expected. This upcoming visit I'll be using a groupon. :)"}
{"text":"We were celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary at the Compass Arizona Grill.  It was an amazing night; the food was A+, the staff A+ and the views through the evening were spectacular.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My first choice in the entire city of Phoenix!  This place always provides a stellar experience for all of my senses.  The view is spectacular, and I (a weather buff) recommend going during monsoon season to enjoy the fantastic electrical storms flashing off in the distance.  The food is excellent (I also recommend the filet).  The service is second to none in the Phoenix area.  It is expensive, but this is the type of place that is meant to be savored only once in a while.  They recently instituted a ($14-ish? can't recall exactly) minimum per person, as many people like to simply enjoy a drink and the view after a downtown event.  The minimum is easy to meet with a drink and dessert - and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Fancy restaurant, with a novel idea. I enjoyed seeing the sunset with my friends during a birthday party. The prickly pear margarita was delicious, but I wouldn't have been able to afford more than one or two! I got the chicken flatbread appetizer as an entree and it was much bigger than any of my friends' entrees. I thorougly enjoyed it: large chunks of cheese and chicken, very flavorful, and enough for two full meals. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"The views are beautiful, the food is delicious, and the service is fantastic. It's the perfect place for an anniversary or to take an out of town guest for a memorable evening."}
{"text":"This is the rotating restaurant on the 24th floor of the Hyatt Regency Hotel in downtown Phoenix. All the tables are on the outside and everyone can see the view. We were told it takes about 50 minutes to do a complete rotation.  The restaurant menu has a good selection with some high end selections as well as some more moderately priced options. I went with the Truffled mushroom bolognese and a small Southwest Caesar salad. The salad was tiny and what made it look even smaller was the large plate it was on. And the salad wasn't anything special except for being a little spicy. The pasta dish was good but not big on flavors.   Service was decent. Our waiter was a little too excitable and it got to be somewhat annoying at times but he was friendly and helpful with dinner selections.  But the best thing about this is the view so my suggestion is go for the view. I'm sure there's better food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This establishment is just ok. Nice facility but the service was subpar. I came here for a business trip at the recommendation of some colleagues. The hostess informed me that there were no reservations until 8pm and refused to seat us although there were open tables. We just decided to look online and check for reservations. Reservations were available beginning at 6:30pm and every half hour so we booked one. We go back to the hostess table and tell her we booked a reservation and she greeted us by rolling her eyes and telling another hostess that they needed to turn off the online reservations. Since we were there, we asked if we could be seated early (it was 6:10pm) she made us wait another 20 minutes although several tables were empty (and remained so). Once seated, tables did not become full until well after 8pm, so in my opinion, this establishment just wanted to maintain an air of \"exclusivity\" or they didn't want to seat my group (a group of professionally dressed women). Our waitress wasn't especially friendly either.  Another server, Jackie who brought us water was exceptionally sweet though. I don't think she was assigned to any specific table but she constantly checked on us to make sure we were ok. The food was ok, nothing that really stood out. The major piece of this location is definitely the views of the city which were beautiful. My recommendation...if you can get beyond the snobbery, save your money and just visit to take pictures."}
{"text":"Great food, almost the best possible for a buffet, and great service made for a very nice Mother's Day Brunch. A little pricier than I would expect for the quality (a buffet can only be SO good...) but all in all, I would recommend to others."}
{"text":"This is by far the nicest restaurant in downtown Phoenix so if you are planning a special occasion or romantic dinner, it is a great option.  The prices are steep but the food is excellent and the portion sizes are ample.  I did think that the ambiance was a bit stuffy.  I think there are much better places in Scottsdale for a fancy dinner but unfortunately not much else in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"We had dinner a few weeks ago at the Restaurant.  1st want to say that the view is spectacular.  I would recommend the lounge to get drinks and have dinner elsewhere.  We started with a fondue that came with the hardest piece of bread on earth.  If you want great fondue, Arrogant Butcher has a great one with warm soft pretzel bread.  I ordered the Sea Bass and my buddy ordered a steak.  Let just say that I have eaten better fish at a Sizzler.  I do not know what happen, but the fish was almost as hard as my bread.  Definitely cooked well well well done and dry.  My buddy's steak was ordered medium rare and you probably already guessed how it came out, well done.  I worked at a restaurant and did not send mine back, but my buddy is from Canada and he sent his steak back.  Well guess what the second one came out the same, well done.  So he just ate it.  There are a lot more places in downtown to choose from for a great dinner.....but not the Compass Grill at the Hyatt.  Thx!"}
{"text":"This is probably more like 3.5-4 stars. Views-great, staff-friendly, food...meh. The biggest problem I had was a few days before the reservation I called to ask if they had a decent vegetarian options or if it was just like one item. She assured me over the phone that they had an \"extensive selection\" and to go online to their menu to see. They did have several options which was great to meet certain diets. When we arrived a lot of the menu was different, the waiter said that they recently changed the menu and he didn't know why some of the options we asked them if they still had were even showing on the menu. Guess what, there was now only one vegetarian option! It was really disappointing, this was a special occasion, and wanted to make sure my partner enjoyed themselves too but unfortunately set a lackluster mood. We would have gone elsewhere if I had known there was only one thing to choose from and the side of seasonal vegetables we paid to add on was about the size of my fist. The food really is kinda subpar which is a shame for how romantic and elegant the atmosphere is.  The Pumpkin risotto did not taste of pumpkin at all, it was more \"flowery\" tasting. The Chicken breast was good but small, the \"creamed Leeks\" weren't really edible, left me hungry for more literally. The views pushed it over the 3 star mark and the staff really were very friendly and on top of their game, drinks were quickly refilled, plates cleared and no question was too small or a hassle.  They did do a great job of making the anniversary itself feel special by congratulating us several times, it was nice. We were able to choose our deserts and comped us for our anniversary which was really really nice of them. Better than some places that just give you some small generic thing. I don't think the food was worth the price, the views are and I'd definitely love to return."}
{"text":"This is THE best place for late night dessert in Phoenix. $7 desserts with one featured every night for $5. Desserts are plated so each one comes with little extras. They are open till 11pm seven nights a week. Couple that with the view and it is a great time. The variety of the menu items is also great: bread pudding, chocolate cake, tiramisu, pineapple upside down cake and creme brulee. I want and will try them all!!!  Service is a little slow, but when you are up there, who cares. More time to look at the changing view."}
{"text":"First time there with friends last night. Have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the experience. All the seats have fantastic views so there is no need to request view seating as I did. We were seated immediately even though we were early. Service was very good and our drinks and bread were delivered promptly. We sat for a while before ordering dinner and were not rushed. Our food order came promptly and was excellent. Had a starter wedge salad and lobster bisque. Both were very good. Main dishes were lobster cavatappi (pasta) in a creme sauce, a filet mignon  a chicken dish. Everything was excellent.   Prices are reasonable and as is typical, if you hold back on the drinks, the total cost is very reasonable as the entree prices are very fair.   The views here are unbeatable as the restaurant makes a complete rotation every hour or so. We'll definitely be back, a fun place."}
{"text":"Wow, so surprised by the other reviews. Went last night, finally! One of the best dining experiences of my life. OUTSTANDING SERVICE! Hi Patti.The food was wonderful. Mango, Tomato, Gazpacho, Chicken and Palenta YUMMY!!!!!!! They did say they just changed their menu a few months ago. ( I am still dreaming about those cheesecake Taquitos and dipping sauces.SIGH) I do agree with the other reviews that the place is shockingly expensive.  You need to save up your pennies. The view is heaven! And the turning part.???? Well it revolves. YES it does. It is what the place is famous for. I never got sick from a revolving restaurant before so not sure about the bad review about that feature  but I guess seasick easily people might want to skip it here and heed the other reviewers warnings. No 5 stars though because I can't afford to eat here on a teachers budget. It probably is a once in a lifetime, or very long in between times, experience for me."}
{"text":"Hmph... I had always wanted to try this spot, and living within walking distance for the past 3 years hasn't done much to change that, until now.  After catching a show at the Herberger, Ashley A. suggested we go here for drinks/food.  I wasn't really feeling it because I was scared of what I expected in terms of premium pricing, but we went anyway.  The elevator ride up was fun and it made my ears pop.  Once we got off the elevator though, things kind of stopped being fun and I felt like I just stepped into a closet.  It was so dark!  I will give the Compass one thing, their service is fantastic.  Unfortunately, service does not make up for the lack of quality in food or the overwhelmingly inflated prices.  They didn't have Coke, which really irritated me, so I just had a water.  We ended up getting the Drunken Shrimp app since we weren't entirely hungry and then the Lava Cake for dessert.  The sauce with the shrimp was startlingly salty.  Even for me, and I oversalt everything.  The shrimp were okay, and there were only three.  Seriously?  20 bucks for 3 shrimp and a piece of bread.  Sheesh!  At least the desserts were priced fairly.  The lava cake was okay, but it doesn't even come close to my beloved Domino's Lava Crunch Cake.    After checking out the rather uninspired menu and it's awe inspiring prices, I won't be back.  Besides, the view from the top of the Chase Tower is much more impressive, so the view alone will not get me to come back."}
{"text":"First things first, bring a flippin jacket!!! It's sooooo cold when the restaurant spins to that one particular spot.   The food overall was ok. I mean $7 for a Caesar salad is a bit much especially when it's not that huge of a portion. I got the chicken and it was good. Nothing to write home about. The service was good I just wasn't super super impressed. I'm not sure if it's because I worked out about an hour prior to coming to this place but I was still hungry.  I think for the price you pay you should get a big portion but that's just me."}
{"text":"I have been to revolving restaurants in the past, and this one is no different. You pay for the revolution, and the dining experience suffers.  My girlfriend and I patiently waited through slow service for mediocre food. I had the pork tenderloin, and the greens were the only delicious aspect. My lady had the tuna and it was equally bleh.   The food provided was $15-18 dollar quality at $25-35 prices. I do not recommend."}
{"text":"The ambiance and view were better than the food or service.  Little pricey but very convenient as we were staying at the hotel.  Worth a trip here for the view but that's really the best part about it."}
