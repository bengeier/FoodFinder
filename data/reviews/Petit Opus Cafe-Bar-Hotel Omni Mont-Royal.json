{"text":"Very nice, tastefully arrayed breakfast buffet. Potatoes and veggie quiche were excellent. Expensive, but if you take a lake breakfast and make it more of a brunch (open till 11) you can fuel yourself for day long exploring of downtown."}
{"text":"Small cafe in the Omni hotel. Breakfast is good and the setting pleasant and bright. Menu is focused but covers a number of dishes. I did not see gluten free - but did not ask, the kitchen was accommodating so they may have options. Fruit was in abundance and of course baked goods.

The eggs where cooked very runny for sunny side - I like this you might mention your taste if a bit more heat is needed. I think possibly a salmon dish was ahead of mine the eggs had a faint fish taste - not bad but subtle.

Bacon was perfect, potatoes a bit dry home style. I went with French toast - was very good.

Pro tip - order off the menu, Buffet is just ok and cost is higher.

Being from Texas I asked for Ice Tea unsweet - Montreal does not usually offer this it has to be made. Opus made it up fresh and it was spot on.

Was an enjoyable breakfast."}
{"text":"Great food. Don't pass up the opportunity to dine here. Had a wonderful beef tenderloin and my wife had the flank steak. Cooked perfectly medium and served with fresh asparagus, yellow carrot, Brussels sprouts, haricot vert, and roasted tomatoes. The fresh baked baguette was a nice touch. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"On our 2nd night in Montreal we were rained in so we decided to have dinner downstairs in the hotel lobby.  The food here was surprisingly good for hotel dining...not to mention great service too!  The waiter was very attentive.  Their fried potatoes are REALLY good - it's lightly battered and saute so it still had a crunch to it."}
{"text":"For three days in a row I was literally fed in this restaurant as part of all day training sessions. It is a pity the resto is located in a hotel and in general it will be ignored by the population of Montreal. Food was really nice. Fresh salads, deliciously looking french fries that made me jealous as I didn't pick a dish including them, huge portion of very well prepared pasta with sausage and shrimp. The pizza I had the last day was relatively good for a non pizza place, but huge. We left so much food behind that I still feel guilty. Service was friendly and very well organized. The room is designed in french bistro style and it is bright, and inviting. It is not cheap if you are there on your own, still a nice option for a good meal in the area."}
{"text":"I woke up at 3am to fly into Montreal...  I arrived tired and the hotel took perfect care of me including pointing me to this restaurant for a bite.  All I can say is wow.  The food here is beyond belief.  The onion soup was made fresh for the individual serving, the wine recommendations were spot on and the lunch lobster role was magnificent.  Not much else to say!"}
