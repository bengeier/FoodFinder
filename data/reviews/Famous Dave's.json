{"text":"Great location fast service   Every time I go to Daves the food is consistent, hot and beer is cold. Basically all you want from bbq joint. Yes some reviews say good is salty and salads aren't that great. I wouldn't know ....I don't go to bbq place for the lettuce but the barnyard animals taste yummy!!!  Oh and buy a jar of pickles when you leave!!!"}
{"text":"Good BBQ. OK but not great. Staff is friendly and fun. Atmosphere is always good. The food is real BBQ not the normal boiled and oven cooked fare. I always can go to a Famous Dave's and know I will get good BBQ at fair prices and sides are always good. I have had 5 star BBQ around the county but when a chain tries to make great BBQ they always seem to fall just short. You will get your moneys worth and have a great meal."}
{"text":"I generally hate bbq but if I am going to eat it with my family this is the place I go. Love the trash lid to share. I also am thankful for the choices of bbq for different pallets or moods."}
{"text":"The absolute best BBQ we've had in Arizona!  Servers are awesome and the food is out of this world!!!  This has become our instant favorite and I highly recommend it to anyone who lives for BBQ!"}
{"text":"Great first time here at Famous Dave's!

The food was amazing. Every bite was super delicious! I'm truly in love with the corn muffins. I was spoiled to a bit of honey to drizzle over the top! Yum! Our party of 6 ordered the feast for 4-6 people. I enjoyed everything! I normally like my corn on the cob a bit more crunchy, but I overlooked that because the corn was very sweet. 

Our server was great and even gave us an introduction to all the sauces while drawing the infamous 'pig' face on a platter with the sauces. She was attentive and engaging! So great to have such a friendly server. Everything came out quick and looked, smelled, and tasted amazing.

The atmosphere was fun, upbeat, and seemed to center around family. Just a great vibe.

We had a blast and loved every bite of food!

Thank you to everyone there who made this experience worth while!"}
{"text":"It's all good here.  Great comfort food and enough for a second meal at home. The thick tater chips are great with the different sauces."}
{"text":"Brenda our server was awesome she made the meal wonderful. She gets an A+. Brisket was excellent!"}
{"text":"We were having a \"girl's night\" and one of group had never been to Famous Dave's and it looks like it's a place that she will be going back to.  Everyone had a wonderful time.  The drinks weren't watered down, the appetizer (smoked salmon spread -- I highly recommend it) was gone in no time.  I had a half rack of baby back ribs with coleslaw and fries.  The slaw wasn't overpowering and I used a couple of BBQ sauces for the fries.  The ribs were perfect with the meat just falling off the bone.  None of us had room for desert so we got it to go.  The bread pudding is wonderful! 

The service was wonderful.  The waitress for our table was attentive without being intrusive and was very patient with the newby to Dave's.

I highly recommend Famous Dave's."}
{"text":"Think twice about eating at this restaurant. If you are not dressed in Friday Casual you will be treated like RIFF RAFF and stuck in the bar with screaming bartenders and wait staff. This is exactly what happened to me and my party, we were seated  in the bar even though the dining room was half empty and all because 2 people in my party were dressed in T-shirts and jeans. The host was going to seat us in the main dining room until he looked past me and decided that we did not fit their profile of the customer they want to have seen in their restaurant. 
After spending years in the hospitality industry I was horrified by the blatant discrimination exhibited by the host and manager of this store/restaurant; apparently they are categorizing people who wear jeans as undesirable. 
ON A SIDE NOTE: the service was so bad, no one in my party had the correct order served to them, they got everything wrong and the food was very disappointing, dried out and burned. So it's my feeling that's one can add sabotage to the discrimination as they want to make sure anyone who fits into this profile does not come back.  I will never be back and it's on to Lucille's!!'"}
{"text":"Family loves this place.
My personal Fav is the Salmon Dip app.
The ribs are great.
Love the different dips....."}
{"text":"I love this place!  They are always friendly and always great service.  Last time got food to go for father's day and everyone loved it.  Hands down best bbq food!"}
{"text":"Every Wednesday for a few weeks now my friend and I meet up at the bar for some Wings and Drinks. We're typically greeted in a very welcoming and friendly fashion by the same bartender, who keeps us well supplied with whatever food or drink we call for. Not only that, he's exceptionally friendly without being annoying, which is a difficult balance to achieve! Definitely recommend a trip to the the bar area!"}
{"text":"Used to be great fast service but not today. Less than 7 tables filled but waiting 10+ minutes for initial drinks and now 20 with no food or server in sight. Now I know why the Thirsty lion is more busy."}
{"text":"I love Famous Daves.  We went two days ago and were very disapponted.  I got rib tips.  They tasted like they had been baked, no smoke flavor what so ever.  They seem to think that if they make the food spicier that will cover up the fact that they are not smoking it properly"}
{"text":"Man their sauce is good. We just had the riblets because we are on a diet and dont eat carbs and boy oh boy they were sooo good.  Happy hour drinks vodka tonic were outstanding and only 5 bucks. We will eat here again when we are in the neigborhood."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's serves up the best barbeque in town, without a doubt. The staff are friendly, the ribs are to die for, and the desserts (if you make it that far) are simply awesome. The feasts on the clean trashcan lid are good value if you have a large number of people in your party and offer you a sampling of some of the best items on the menu. If in doubt, though, try the St. Louis ribs. I've had them often and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Not a huge meat eater but had to come in and try the catfish filet. Wasn't expecting anything too fantastic as we are in the desert BUT I was pleasantly surprised when dinner arrived. Decent presentation and sides were \"okay\" but the star was the fish. The way it was prepared was perfect. Light batter, lightly salted, flaky, great taste and texture. MMMmmm just thinking about it makes me hungry ;)
They do have vegetable options such as corn, broccoli, salad and beans so that's what we got with it and I'd call it a success. Price was VERY reasonable at about $12 so if you are a catfish fan, you must try. They also have strips as an app as well as the filet."}
{"text":"Had the Georgia Chopped Pork platter for lunch yesterday; very good. Meat was moist and flavorful. The baked beans had a nice smoky flavor. Service was attentive."}
{"text":"It is hard to find a good bbq spot in AZ. Famous Dave's make you wanna go back.
I love all the different sauces they have. 
My favorite is the Devils spit. 
The baby back ribs are awesome, smoked to perfection and nice and tender.
Service is always friendly and efficient here."}
{"text":"i agree with jon on this one. famous dave's does have great BBQ. and the setting is perfect for it. big tables for big parties. it's ideal for sharing, conversing, you name it. get your hands dirty and dig in. famous dave's is yummy."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I ordered from Famous Dave's. I must say I was very happy with the service.  I ordered food to go.  The employee I spoke to over the phone was extremely friendly and patient while taking my order and giving me directions to the restaurant.  Once I got there I was greeted with a smile and was immediately helped.  I ended up making a last minute change to my order and was accomodated with no problem.  While I waited there for my order to be ready about 4 or 5 waiters and waitresses who walked by asked me if I had been helped.  This hardly happens at other places where they just walk by and ignore you.  I was very satisfied with the level of service, the food was great!!! I will be going back and hope to dine in next time."}
{"text":"Got seated around 11:30 am, only 3 other people in the bar area, took the bartender almost 15 minutes to drift over to take drink orders, got served drinks, another 15 minutes before asking us what we'd like to order.  The food was so SALTY it was virtually inedible; the meat entrees were cold, and the mac 'n cheese was congealed.  One of the WORST meals ever....."}
{"text":"This place is ok.  I always get the St. Louis style ribs, which are tasty unless you get a crummy batch.  I once sent two back because they were basically burnt with no meat and got back two gorgeous looking huge tasty ribs :)  The cornbread muffins, sweet apples & corn are all good - but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy, yummy barbecued pork ribs! I always get the Regular Ribs - 1/3 Slab Platter with a baked potato instead of the sides (which are blah). The corn on the cob and corn bread muffin that come with the Platter are delicious as well. My husband enjoys the Texas Beef Brisket.

So far, I haven't found another BBQ restaurant in the Valley that's better!

UPDATE: I still really like the BBQ here, but we prefer the Mesa Riverview location as it's less busy. Hmm, I'm downgrading from a previous 5-star. That was probably a bit crazy anyway. : )"}
{"text":"Baby back ribs were awful, so tough we couldn't cut through them and we struggled to pull them apart. Couldn't believe it. Sides were good and service ok, so some of their staff must have it together. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Great BBQ - Friendly staff, super atmosphere and reasonable prices - what else can you ask for? 
Ribs and BBQ Chicken are my favorite.  Try the Devils spit sauce if you dare."}
{"text":"What can I say besides, \"I love this place!\"  The food is excellent, the decor is nice and the service is great!  Plus, it's always nice getting a free meal on your birthday when buying another meal!  Try the ribs - they are yummy!"}
{"text":"Get the famous sampler for 2. It has chicken,  ribs, beef brisket. All were cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"Gabi the server was inattentive and no where to be found. Food was cold. Never received chips. I like famous Dave foods but, I like it served hot not cold."}
{"text":"Love this place. Service is great and on point every time. The food is excellent every visit without fail and I love seeing familiar faces when I drop by with the family. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"All the food was great. They love new guest and want you keep on coming back so let them know its your first time there."}
{"text":"Omg I love famous daves!! Their food is amazing, the service is above average and I always get my food right away. I would eat there every day."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's has some great sauces to choose from.  I am a fan of the Fire Pit.  The food is great and filling.  You get a lot of food for a decent price.  We had excellent service as well.  But, then again, it was a Monday late afternoon.  The place was pretty empty."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch, if you get there before 5 they have a special which is well worth the 10.00 price, two meats and two sides.  Had the ribs and the chicken.  Enjoyed both.  Loved the atmosphere, all the waiters were very friendly.  Would definitly go back."}
{"text":"big portion. ribs r really good. i'm a pork fan and i luv it."}
{"text":"Took our friends here at the husband's request - it was his birthday. First time for my husband and me. While we usually don't go out for BBQ much, I have to say, the flavor was very good compared to a handful of other popular BBQ restaurants that we've been to. As another reviewer stated, there are about 5 different BBQ sauces available, on your table in a condiment caddy. Our friend talked up the place, as he has been a few times. There was a plate on the table. He told us the waiter will give us homemade BBQ chips, and then squeeze out the different sauces and explain how each one differs from the others as we dip our chips into them. We thought that would be cool. Waiter was nice enough, at least he smiled as he took our drink and food orders. Aside from that, the service was subpar. There were 4 of us. 2 waters, 1 Pepsi, 1 Mr. Pibb. He forgot who had the waters - he had to ask. Okay, I'll give him that one. He arrived with the homemade chips. Then he left. Our friend said, \"Hey, he didn't show us the sauces.\" So our friend does his own little demonstration for us. The sauces all had good flavor and the chips were very tasty. Hubby and I order a Feast for One to share. Waiter says he will bring an extra plate. Our friends are half-way through their meals until he comes back and asks if we're okay. We ask for our plate. \"Oh yeah, I completely forgot\" he says. He does not notice we need a refill on the sodas. We ask for refills, telling him what we originally had. He comes back and tells us he doesn't know which is which, so \"you'll just have to taste them and see.\"  Our friend had a birthday coupon which he presented prior to ordering. Waiter said, \"Hey, Happy Birthday, man.\" That was the last comment made about his birthday. At most restaurants I've been to, they at least acknowledge the birthday somehow, even if it's to thank the person for spending their birthday at their establishment. Can you tell I value good service? You bet! Alright, here's the review of what hubby and I ordered, the Feast for One:

Good
Portions. We were both full, and I still brought home something for the dog.
Chopped pork was excellent! Very tender, very good flavor.
Wilbur beans yummy
Coleslaw good, sweet
Corn on the cob tender, sweet, not overcooked 
Famous fries very good
Corn muffin was a treat, very sweet and dense

Disappointing
St. Louis spareribs. I went to separate the bones with my fork, but couldn't get my fork into it. Good flavor if I just wanted to lick it. Hubby gnawed on it a little for the flavor. I'm sure our dog will love it.
BBQ chicken. Can you say DRRRRYYYYY? I will debone that and give it to the dog as well.

Quick, someone hand me my water, or was it a Pepsi? or a Mr. Pibb? Would I ever go back? Probably, for the chopped pork and corn muffin, and hope we get a better server."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm not from the South, I'm not a BBQ connoisseur BUT I've eaten enough good BBQ to know what a beef brisket sandwich is supposed to taste like.  What I had at Famous Dave's earlier this afternoon was NOT BBQ.  It was thawed meat that tasted like Little League hot dogs and with absolutely no BBQ sauce.  Honestly, the best part of my meal was the bread.  Yeah, that's what I came for...the bread.  Do yourself a favor and skip Famous Dave's. Skip the crap chain restaurants are dishing out and go for a mom and pop BBQ place."}
{"text":"My family and I enjoyed a great dinner with excellent service.  Famous Landon was an exceptional server.  It was our first time at Famous Dave's and we didn't know what to expect.  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"This was the first time that I ate here and I too am glad that it opened up near me. I have not heard of this place but saw it while visiting San Tan Mall. I ate here for lunch and I tried the Texas Beef Brisket Sandwich and fries with baked beans. The Sandwich was great, the fries were cooked well, and the bean were flavorful. The beer was really cold and so was the glass and that was very important for me. The prices for lunch were great and the people were all very nice. 

Oh and another important thing is the bathrooms were clean! I don't have one reason not to give them anything but 5 stars. Yay."}
{"text":"This is my second review for Famous Daves at San Tan Village. My first review (only 2 stars) was definitely geared toward the service on the visit; however, Famous ETHAN redeemed my faith in the service at this establishment. Not only was Ethan friendly and helpful, he was an excellent server who went the extra mile to ensure that our experience was first class! From the very beginning of the ordering process, he was thorough and made suggestions. Ethan also explained the sauces in a way that no one else ever has. He took his time with our table, yet I noted he was attentive to all of his other tables as well. (He can definitely multi task and balance his priorities.) Our food came out promptly and fresh. I could tell that he did not allow it to sit under warmers. Drinks were plentiful as he refilled prior to any request by us. Additionally, this young man seems genuinely sincere. If you go to this Famous Daves location, I highly suggest you request to be seated in Ethan's section. I know we will!"}
{"text":"I returned after about 8 months tonight and discovered they got rid of the awesome chips they served before your meal. I loved those because you could try all their sauces. I loved that they were freshly made too. I ordered an Ultimate Burger, which tasted amazing as always. I just thought the portion size of fries was smaller than normal."}
{"text":"Just visited this place? Lousy service!!!  I would not recommend to anyone. Had to go to register to get check and both the waiter and mgr thought it funny!
DO NOT GO!!!"}
{"text":"This is the 3rd they messed up my order
Came in on a dinner break and order a pulled pork sandwich with a side of mash potatoes
Well get to work and to my surprise I have a pull chicken sandwich with mash potatoes
Last time I went in order a full slab or St Louis ribs and drive home and have baby back ribs instead
How difficult is it for a cashier to put in the right order especially when everything is generated by a computer
My feeling is this people really don't know how to read and it's only going to get worse as more and more of our young people try to make it in this world.... God help us!

{"text":"Fantastic Happy Hour here. I like the various sauces they have available for your meats.

Not a BBQ expert but this is definately one of the best in town."}
{"text":"This place was alright, I'm not a big fan of BBQ but I can hang with this place. I like that there is a selection of sauces on your table so every bite can be a new experience. I was especially impressed with the service! The wait staff were constantly checking on us and the manager came to us and gave us coupons and a free bottle of sauce because I was just so cute, just kidding hahaha, really because it was our first time. Good promo!
I'll be back whether I like BBQ or not!"}
{"text":"I've heard pretty good things about this place, that just weren't lived up to. We came in after class on a thrisday, and even though it was pretty dead, the hostess didn't seat us for a good five minutes. Another waitress had to seat us. Our wait or was very prompt however and the food was fairly fast coming out. To bad the quality was so poor. Just the over all flavors were bland and liquid smoke was really the only over all flavor. Very disappointed, but the staff was alright."}
{"text":"Went to Famous Dave's thinking I was going to get some good tender ribs and they were so tough, I had to put them back on the grill and cook them for another hour to get them to be tender.  The taste was not the best as I had asked for no sauce.  I enjoy the meat with a mild rub on it but mine was filled with sauce.  I didn't think to check my order before leaving otherwise I would have taken them back."}
{"text":"Great service. Eddie made our experience most remarkable. Food was good. Potato n bacon soup a little salty. Everything else was good. Defenetly coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Was a great experience
Went in around 6 server was kind friendly and very helpful. Food was good, my side of fries was huge and the steal and cheeseburger where very large and cooked well."}
{"text":"best bbq !!! Their staff is friendly.. down side is there isn't raspberry tea :( the location of the place is good :)"}
{"text":"We had the platter. The brisket, ribs and chicken tasted like they had been refrigerated for the last 5 days, reheated and served with fresh potato wedges. Tasted very dry, not like fresh sliced meat or BBQ chicken. Not impressed."}
{"text":"I'll tell you the maitre d was was not as accommodating as the waitress but once we got to the waitress and the food everything was a-ok!

She was more then happy to accommodate requests.  Hot hellfire pickles!  Good food, what you'd expect from a plane like this. Good BBQ ."}
{"text":"was at Spring Training a few weeks ago....the food was amazing, the beer was COLD, and the waitress was fabulous....we were lucky and hit the place before 5pm, and the prices were so so lowwwwwwwwwwwwwww  see you again in 2 yrs!"}
{"text":"ordered beef brisket cheese burger and two fresh lemonade for me and 6 yr old son. brisket was pretty good.  table was sticky like someone barely wiped the table.  the two fresh lemonades was 3.99 each and I never got a refill so I drank both my son's too.  asked a take out cup but the lid didn't fit.  they still didn't refill so all I had was ice.  didn't even taste like fresh lemonade.  wasn't happy getting charged $8 for a lemonade for just me while my son had 1 gulp.  still I left $4 tip on $22 bill."}
{"text":"From the huge portions to the variety of sauces and decent beer selection this is my favorite BBQ joint in the area...since Hoggy's closed down.  Sure there are other places that do individual components better, but there's really none in the area that hit all the right points on such a consistent basis."}
{"text":"Our first experience at Famous Dave's was one of our best so far since moving to Gilbert over four months ago. Our server Eddie was very friendly and made excellent recommendations.  We had a chance to meet Wilbur and also had an opportunity to meet Cheryl, the manager who brought us our food.  Cheryl took time to speak with us like we were family who had come to her house for dinner.  All of our food was excellent and delivered in a very timely manner.  When we asked for our check, it was delivered by Cheryl who also brought us a free desert welcoming us to Gilbert.  We will be back and we plan to tell others about our great experience."}
{"text":"I can describe Famous Dave's in one word.....  Indescribable, unbelievable, and undeniably incredible.  This is no joke, but one time I was swimming in the Pacific Ocean and I thought I saw a shark and got completely freaked out because a good friend told me that there was a fence built under the water to keep them away, which I guess sounds silly now, but she was very confident and it certainly kept my fears at bay.  Anyways, I died for a few minutes, and when I got into Heaven it was actually a Famous Dave's run by all four Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and a dog we had growing up that ran away called Licorice...  Actually that is not a true story but it's the only way to adequately describe my feelings for this place.  
I know it sounds like I'm just talking a lot of S word, but they give you a lot of reasons to have loving feelings.  I always like at Mexican Food restaurants when they bring out Chips and Salsa, and FD's sets itself apart by being a Barbecue Joint that gives you in the beginning a bowl of these weird, delicious chips that you can dip in all the different barbecue sauces to try them out.  It's pretty awesome.  They also have Pepsi, which overjoys me to no end.  Like that old Fairy Tale says, \"Girls are sexy, made out of Pepsi.\"  And that's 99% true.
And don't even get me started on the food...  Okay, I'm going to start anyways.  It's consistently amazing, and always super quick and hot and outrageously delicious.  Just close your eyes and point at something and get that, it will be perfect.  I don't know if it's conceited to make recommendations, but I have very strong feelings for the Country Roasted Chicken, it's got just a hint of a lemony flavor that is very enjoyable.  And the Corn Muffins are borderline to die for.  The people there are also very wonderful.  They have always been so personable and welcoming and super accommodating.  My only complaint is that it's like eight miles away, which isn't really a complaint at all.  
So that is that, this review has gone on for far too long, but if you are reading this and are on the fence on where to go to get a bite to eat, just stop looking, and go to Famous David's, which is what my friends call it sometimes, no big deal.  On a semi related note, I probably should have prefaced this whole thing by saying I've been there like fifty times, maybe more.  I don't know what I'm talking about pretty much all the time, but I do know that these words are all completely true.  Thank you for reading, and stay excellent."}
{"text":"FAMOUS DAVE'S! Upon first arrival, the place is packed on a Saturday night. Hostess seems aggrivated, probably because it's busy. Sass level is 7 out of 10 aha. Wait Time isn't too bad when packed. About 30-35 minutes. At this point I've had no food, but I'm even hungrier! The smells are intoxicating! 

The good- decent service and greeting, nothing extraordinary, just ordinary.  Helped is with the sauces,  which are a wide variety and amazing! I loved the cornbread muffin, and the RIBS! Who goes to a BBQ and doesn't try the ribs? My wife loved em!

The bad- the ribs however weren't the best, the we're great don't get me wrong but I've had cheaper ribs at cheddars and those tasted better. Like another review I saw, the sides were bland, very bland. And the chicken!  Almost forgot!  It was terrible chicken.  Tasted super low quality,  which would have been acceptable had the plate been 10 bucks,  but it was 20.
Overall, I would only reccomend this to serious BBQ fanatics or those craving it once in a blue moon. Not your go to place. Please adjust staff for friendliness! Waitress was ok."}
{"text":"Love the ribs here. Unfortunately, cash is tight so when I stopped by yesterday I figured I'd grab a quick pork sandwich. Easier on the wallet, but still a tasty BBQ option. I was greeted by a nice young lady who  asked if I was interested in happy hour. The bar was looking pretty quiet and there were a bunch of nice TVs up so I figured why not. The bar girl was nice and got me going quickly (I was her only guest for a few minutes). I ordered my pork sandwich and she asked me if I wanted wings or nachos or happy hour grub. I asked what was on special. She said this and that and then she said RIBS. I said, \"ribs?\" She said yes, they had changed their happy hour menu and they had 3 ribs and some fries for $5. I said ,\"Oh, so it's a different rib than the ones on the regular menu that are about $15.\" She said no, they were the same famous ribs. I cancelled my pork sandwich right there and got the ribs. 

AMAZING!!!
These ribs are so good.  Smoky, saucy, meaty hunks of heaven. I can't believe they serve the same awesome ribs on happy hour now. Mine were perfect and they even came with some fries. This is my happy hour spot at least once a week now. The best ribs and you can't beat $5."}
{"text":"Decided to try Dave's again and was really disappointed. We each got a baby back rib combo, one with roast chicken and one with brisket. The brisket was very good, the chicken was good but the baby backs were terrible. Not only were they tough, just about burnt and over done, they had their spicy hot sauce on them. $47 dollars later and most likely our last time ordering from Dave's!!!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. Everyone is really nice and I like how they take the time to explain each sauce. I'm not a die hard bbq fan but I was impressed by the food. I have only had Famous Dave's from a catered lunch at work but never actually went to a restaurant. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the corn in the mac n cheese. It was still good though. Other than that minor thing everything was really good!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered for my son and I but when it was time to leave everyone was so nice. Then I get home and our order was switched or something because the only person who got any 'Famous Dave's' was my husband. Maybe do yourselves a favor and check your food before you send it out."}
{"text":"I walked in here for lunch today and I was like \"whoa\". And my co-worker was all \"wha?\" And then some random lady was all \"foo-ie\" and we were like \"say what?\" And then this old school dude was all \"yo, 'fo shizzle\" so we were all \"table for 7, bra!!\" And the host guy was all \"you got it\". So then I was all \"don't be such a barney\". I'm pretty sure he didn't get the reference but that's okay. 

The food was good. Sampler platter, grubalicous. I went with the 2 meat combo and did the bbq pulled pork and beef brisket even though I'm 110% vegan. If leaves tasted that good, then I probably wouldn't have to stray so often. Love their mac 'n cheese too. I would bathe in it if I could."}
{"text":"We eat here all the time. Great service and the most amazing burgers. YUM!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time and was not impressed. My order was forgotten amongst my party of five. The side of fries was never ordered either. When my order was brought out it had the wrong beans. The brisket I had was very fatty and the green beans were soggy and filled with water. My wife's Georgia pork was not moist or pulled, it wast dry and  chunky. The garlic mashed was unremarkable and the serving size looked like it was like a serving sized with small  of ice cream scoop. I will not go back, I've been to far better in the Valley."}
{"text":"Got a pickup order from this location a few days ago. Typically we dine in,  the food and service have been adequate. This time the food was terrible. I normally get the rib tips with coleslaw and Beans.  Most of the the ribs were hard and dry. The coleslaw tasted like it had some sort of chemical on it, and the beans were canned pork n beans.  
We called the restaurant and spoke to the manager. He  apologized and said he would replace the meal. He was very nice and accommodating. 
I don't blame the manager,he can't see every order that comes out of the kitchen. I do blame the cooks. I would never serve food like that to anyone. I don't know what's going on at this location, but the food has gone way down."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite BBQ Restaurants that my friend and I frequent for a good meal and Moonshine beverages. We head straight to the bar which I've found has quick service, all the headlining (sports) games on multiple screens and delicious mixed drinks. Your choice of Bar top seating, booths or outside seating. We order and share the Feast for 1, which is plenty of food for 2 ladies and even leftovers. The cornbread muffins are a sin and should be there own food group. Be sure to grab a couple bottles of their BBQ Sauce to take home."}
{"text":"We worked on the 4th of July and weren't able to go to any celebrations. Came home and fell asleep until 9:30 pm and woke up hungry. Decided that we at least had to have BBQ in honor of the day. Famous Daves is nearby and we decided to try them out and see why they are so \"Famous\". After trying their All American Platter @ $50 ... we are still wondering......"}
{"text":"I've worked near FDs for years, and I always wanted to stop in, but I never did.  Now I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.

I had a BBQ sandwich, and it was really good.  Fries were a little on the salty side - only negative."}
{"text":"Leaving the airport, we headed straight for Famous Dave's to try out their pork sampler and long list  of sweet and tangy sauces.  Boy! I can see why my brother raves about this place. 

I had their barbq chicken salad (very yummy).   Although the orders were huge, we were able to save room for the delectable Dave's Famous Bread Pudding.  That alone will bring me back time and time again."}
{"text":"Ate here two times. Both times food was excellent. People are nice and service at bar was excellent.  Big screen tvs with games on at bar. All in all good food and good atmosphere. Will be eating here again."}
{"text":"In my quest to find the ultimate barbeque I tried Famous Dave's.  It's not the ultimate.  It's chain restaurant quality.  OK, but not great.  I hate the way they use so much sugar in all the side dishes and cornbread.  Way too sweet for me.  Dumping lots of sugar in food is a cheap and easy way to make food sell.

The meats were all good, if not great.  The five different sauces were OK.

If you want great babeque search for a barbeque book on Amazon and make it yourself at home."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's is a delicious restaurant located next to the North Olmsted Mall and is a great place for traditional American barbecue! My personal favorite is that they provide you with as many hefty brown paper towels \"As God will allow\" on your tables with a roll at each table. You even get a selection of six delicious sauces, but my favorite is the Texas pit because it features a sweet Cajun complement to your meat of choice (heh heh heh). Unfortunately, the mixed drinks taste very weak... But they kick you in the ass without realizing it until you stand up.

Now on to the food! I always order the feast for two because I think it is the best deal on the menu. Not only do you get ribs that are falling off the bone, a whole chicken, a bowl of baaaaaked beeeeeans, probably three potatoes worth of thick cut but surprisingly crispy fries, 2 cornbreads, 3 corn-on-the-cobs, another meat of choice like pulled pork or brisket or (something else I didn't order) and coleslaw which I always replace with mac and cheese that has a hint of spice and probably crack.

Overall, the service is excellent and you get a stupid amount of food for the price with guaranteed leftovers for even the heartiest of appetite. Hooraaay!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service. Definitely need to try the family play, it comes on a trash can lid!!! Also pickup some of Thor BBQ sauce 2 go, it goes great on all meats."}
{"text":"Just left Famous Daves..I ordered a burger with onion strings and cheese on top.
When the food arrived, the burger was huge!
First bite had me. Every bite was juicy, succulent and full of flavor. Got the Cole slaw as a side...it was cold, crunchy and outstanding as well.
I left with a very full stomach, and a smile on my face. Service was excellent and very fast.
The server told me that they mix a little pork in with the beef, to make that burger. All in all, a clear 5 star performance. Rarely moved enough to write a review on a burger, but this one clearly deserved it, hands down.
A rare treat today in a world of food, that seems to hover around average. I wasn't expecting to be blown away by my meal, but was moved enough to write this.
Amazed this place wasn't packed, but I did go in at 4pm, so probably beat the rush.
All in all, a real bright spot in my day."}
{"text":"Our family is originally from Georgia(we moved here 3 years ago) and we are used to great barbeque. My daughter and her husband happened upon Famous Dave's.When they got home all they could talk about was how much they loved the place.So, the whole family went and they really understated just how great this place is! The manager came over and asked how was everything and I told him that the staff was shear perfection!The food was the best barbeque we have ever had and the atmosphere of the restaurant was so fun! I love their products so much that I buy the 4 pack Famous Dave's sauces for Christmas gifts. I give gift cards for birthday and anniversary gifts. I hate shopping, so this makes my life so much easier. I believe my family really loves getting these items as gifts, because they ask me to please give them the same gifts again next year. We always end up with to-go containers, because the portions are HUGE! That is why we go for lunch,then we eat the food we brought home for dinner.Oh and I almost forgot to mention the corn muffins, WOW, they are amazing! We go to Famous Dave's approximately 2 times a month and have always been extremely satisfied! When I had my restaurant(I'm a chef )I had difficulty finding servers that met my expectations. Famous Dave's has hit the jackpot with their servers and their kitchen staff! Keep up the great work and we will see you soon."}
{"text":"Food was blah. Nothing exciting. The bbq sauce was a typical kind of sweet, sticky sauce--didn't capture my taste buds. The chicken was a bit dry even though I asked for dark meat. The ribs were sitting out for awhile or so it tasted and they were dry as well. 

Bobby Q still tops my list for Phoenix."}
{"text":"The ultimate i a must try. If you like it spicy definitely use the devil spit BBQ sauce. Side salad was cheap and a large portion"}
{"text":"Place was jumping today...outside and inside. Food was wonderful. Service was great. Price was awesome. I'll be back."}
{"text":"If you like barbeque you have to go here.   The food is awesome.  another plus is that the air conditioner works so well wear a sweater even in the summer!"}
{"text":"Located right next door to the sports complex, the service was acceptable, the place was clean, and the food was tasty. The prices are kind of high, but for a chain, it was okay, there are netter places to eat in Peoria, but the location here is hard to beat when your going to baseball."}
{"text":"I've been a frequent customer of this establishment for years. I think we go there at least once a month.  Yes its a chain and their t-shirts are hokey but their food is probably some of the best BBQ I have eaten.  My favorite entree is the catfish fingers (which they discontinued *boo*).  There is a selection for any picky eater.  I'm not a big red meat eater so its refreshing to have so many chicken and pork selections.  The side dishes are probably what seals the deal for me.  My favorites are the mac and cheese and wilbur beans.  

The only misgivings I have are:

#1) The manager needs to stay in the kitchen and not check with every diner how things are going..

#2) I try not to eat in the bar area, they tend to spend more time doing drink orders since it is the bar.

All in all it is probably in the top 5 of restaurants that I eat at regularly."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! We were very impressed! The food and service were both 5 star. Our waiter Evan was  fast and friendly. Also, the manager Cheryl was wonderful! Too much to explain, just an all around great experience. We will return upon our next visit to Phoenix (Chandler)."}
{"text":"Good  food, but.....There can't be 4 oz of meat on the Texas Manhandler for $9.00...The Great American meal looks must better in the picture than on the plate...The place is so noisy with all the help sliding chairs around and slamming tables together you have a headache by the time you leave..."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but after two tries I will not be back. One, very overpriced. Two, I could look past the price if the food was good. Tried the ribs the first time and was sad at the quality. The second time, tried some sandwiches and still disappointed in the quality and price. I've found that it is hard to find a good place to eat in Madison. Been here a few months and have found only a couple of good places."}
{"text":"What a great barbecue place. Great ribs, brisket and my favorite the burnt ends. Good cornbread, slaw and fries as sides. Eaten there about a dozen times and always had great service."}
{"text":"The bar menu is fabulous! Drinks are a great price. The staff is always friendly and awesome. Wilber's Revenge is my new favorite hot sauce. The catfish is tender, melting in your mouth. You can fill up on delicious bbq and beer for less then $10 a person here."}
{"text":"Lemonade was great. Sauces are good, flavorful. Cornbread was buttery and crisp. But the brisket was tough and gummy. The chicken was ok but wasn't much. Gone after a few pinches off the bone. I don't like thigh meat. I expected pulled bbqed breast meat. But it was whole chicken thighs so the meat was not flavorful. The beans were described beautifully but it was just plain ole beans with no flavor."}
{"text":"Love Famous Dave's!!!

The smoked brisket just melts in your mouth and the pulled pork is equally FAN-FREAKING-TASTIC!!! This is typically what I order when I go there for lunch on the weekends. Their lunch menu, which is available all the way to 5:00 PM, is a great deal. I usually get the two meat one (already mentioned which meats I prefer), with a side of slaw, green beans as a replacement for a corn cobette, and a corn muffin. Usually scaled down lunch portions are not as satisfying as their relative dinner portion. This lunch portion, however, is more than enough food to stuff your gord.

Will I go back to Famous Dave's, specifically the one at San Tan? You're darn right I will again-and-again-and-again."}
{"text":"Can you say \"Smoked Out\". Sweet Jesus, I thought someone  was having a BBQ. Famous Dave's- Chandler is the best y'er gonna get. Go Git'chu some. Great customer service, attentive wait staff, HELL'A good food."}
{"text":"We were taking my elderly father out for his birthday, he likes ribs and lives past Avon. 

I looked and this was the only highly regarded BBQ place on the west side. So we gave it a shot.

Because of his age I called and asked if there could be a special allowance on reservations - they usually only take them for 12+ people - so he wouldn't have to wait (tire). 

I hereby upgrade Famous Adam to 'SuperFantabulous Adam', he made everything work and it went perfectly. All the staff was great.

The food. When people think Cleveland 'Awesome Perogis' come more to mind than BBQ, but, this was really good stuff. I had the Feast for One and loved it. Excellent. I found 'Devils Spit' to be the perfect heat for me, but of course that's personal. I tasted most of the many sauces and they were all good.

Many had mentioned the beans as a standout. And the cornbread. They are. Queue \"Beans and Cornbread\" by Louis Jordan and the Tympany Five - crumple the cornbread into the beans. Perfection. I'd come back just for that, as if the meats weren't enough.

I'm not going to do a play by play of everyone's dinner. I did really like the ribs though, and my better half loved the burnt ends. 

Thanks again Famous Daves for help making an excellent time."}
{"text":"Let me just preface by saying that I don't like BBQ (not the flavor, nor the smell, etc...).  It was against my better judgement to visit this place and even consider eating here as I don't enjoy the taste at all...but, having said that - I was coerced into joining for lunch - so off I went.

First of all, I was very impressed with how extensive the menu was.  It had everything from citrus-y grilled salmon, to burgers and of course BBQ.  I had the iced tea along with the extremely hot boneless wings (Wilbur's Revenge).  I have to admit the chicken was very spicy (I could definitely handle hotter) - but I was impressed.  I had their fries, mac 'n' cheese and corn.  The food was very fresh and tasty.  The other party had the lemon roasted chicken - wow!  Very fresh and with the Wilbur's Revenge sauce and a little tabasco to kick it up, the meal was much more enjoyable than I had ever expected it to be.  I will be back to try the bleu cheese burger, the cod sandwich, and the...sweet tea, and the list goes on!"}
{"text":"Who honestly doesn't like BBQ?  Anyways, the BBQ chicken was excellent.  It felt like we got a lot of food for our money.  The side dish choices were good as well.  We got the buffalo wings as an appetizer and they were kind of mild (and I am not that great with spicy things so for me, saying something is mild is a lot!), but it still tasted good.  Our waiter was a nice guy.  He helped us out in showing us the tshirts for sale so my boyfriend could buy one.  We enjoyed ourselves immensely."}
{"text":"My brother and I were out in San Tan and while trolling around for restaurants, we found Famous Dave's.  I like Rudy's BBQ'd meats but don't really care for their beans or coleslaw..  The hostess was pleasant and seated us immediately. Our waitress was very attentive and never let our drinks go empty.  One unique thing that Dave's does is give you a basket of freshly cooked potato chips and the waitress uses the chips to taste all their varieties of BBQ sauce.  I had a brisket sandwich and found the meat to be tender, well flavored with just the right amount of smokiness.  My brother also enjoyed his meal.  I am looking forward to my next visit to Dave's so I can try more offerings from their menu."}
{"text":"At first we thought it was a good place to go for BBQ but each time we went we found something that just wasn't right.  We would mention the problem and made to feel like we didn't know what we were talking about.

When the last order had more fat than meat and again the management seem not interested in replacing our order with one with meat, we have never been back and never will go there again."}
{"text":"My family always orders the XXL rib platter and it never fails to fill us up properly. It comes with celery and carrot sticks, corn on the cob, a corn muffin, and your choice of two sides. For under thirty bucks, it's a pretty good deal. We always get sauce on the side and they are always generous with providing more than necessary. The meat itself is never tough. It is always tender with a nice smoky flavor to it."}
{"text":"Oh boy this finger licking BBQ serverd sweet with a smoking fire on the side of your mouth the drinks are amazing I ordered a Arnold Palmer sweet and sour to a Sweet tea and burgers are top notch up to the best I have ever had I give famous Dave's a 5 star rateing my eatting experience was very good workers on there game every thing was very smoking good"}
{"text":"Great food and a friendly and helpful staff!  This is our favorite moderately-priced place to go on a date night!  Try the baby back ribs and jalepeno mac 'n cheese!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"What used to be a favorite barbecue restaurant for me, for a chain establishment that is, has fallen under the influence of poor corporate policy. Dry meat, undercooked potatoes (in their potatoe salad), dwindling portions, VERY POOR service and increased pricing. They have of course kept up their overall packaging and food presentation, but that doesn't do anything for your tastebuds. As a matter of fact, I'd prefer to eat at a converted older residential property with the sawed in half 50 gallon drum cookers outside to a phony generic mall location. TOO BAD, I'LL NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN!"}
{"text":"We got a feast for 4 and wow soo much food ( took some home) it was so good our server was so nice and polite. We will be coming back. This is 3rd time being here and wow all over again."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Famous Jen needed help. Not sure if she was the only one or what, but she only checked on us once after we got our food. She didn't even stop to hear our answer . Never filled my water once. Never gave any of us at our table a refill. Tried to get her attention several times and she acted like she didn't see us. The only time she acted happy was when she took our money $$ and as we walked out so she could fill another table."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time last Tuesday night (3/3/15).  Had an absolutely wonderful experience.  Our waiter, James, was so friendly and accommodating.  Took time to explain the menu & even gave us a couple of samples of the sides & entrees.  The St. Louis ribs were done to perfection, and the brisket was moist and flavorful.  The portion sizes were plentiful.  Be sure to save room for their bread pudding - you will not be disappointed.  We will definitely be back....."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Nice, warm southwestern atmosphere. Better if you sit in one of the booths rather than the tables. 
Service: Not bad, but not special either. 
Food: Ranges from Good to very good. Quite consistent. The entrees are large enough, and come with a number of side dishes which is more than satisfactory."}
{"text":"Our server Josh was outstanding the food was great and the sauce is Devine. Great meal good price will be back!"}
{"text":"The only thing preventing this Famous Dave's from getting 5 stars is the acoustics. Like all Famous Dave's that we have gone to, the music is very loud... but, for some reason this particular site seems to have an extra 'tinny' din that makes casual conversation nearly impossible. I felt sorry for 'Famous Anthony' because I could tell he was struggling to understand our orders. If you have a chance to sit in Anthony's section, you will be delighted! He was attentive, humorous without being annoying, and made our large family gathering feel like it was 'no problem'. Inlaws, 5 children and my husband and I... 9 folks to keep satisfied, and he performed amazingly!"}
{"text":"Best Bar B Que in the state of Arizona and Texas....The pulled chicken is moist, juicy, tender, delicious. The ribs are seasoned, smoked and not boiled ala PAPAS BOIL B QUE IN TEXAS.  The smoked dip served with Pita is excellent try the stuffed potatoes and baked beans you'll be in love. Dickies and Papas in Texas take some advice go to Famous Daves and ask them to teach you how to cook."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 x & haven't had an issue until today. (A wednesdsy night around 6) We went there tonight, watched other people get sat ahead of us that came in after us. We had a 9 person party (4 adults & 5 kids) but told the hostess that we'd be ok splitting into 2 booths or sitting outside. We ordered appetizers as soon as we sat down. 30 min later we placed our order. After an hour of being there we got up & found our waitress to cancel the apps that never showed up. 10 min later we got up again & asked for chips to calm down the kids. Out of chips- they gave us soup crackers instead. At least it was something.  Our food eventually came in a few different trips over 10 minutes. I got my food before my kids & that really bothered me. By the time they got theirs, mine was cold. Kids meals.... shouldn't take longer than a feast to prepare. The waitress was nice & apologized, repeatedly blamed it on slow kitchen staff. The manager came out at the end & did comp us a large portion of our meal for the problems. She also blamed it on poor kitchen staffing. Even so, I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon if ever. For the cost, the food was just so so. Nothing special here."}
{"text":"All I can say is DELISIOSO!  I had the lunch special of St. Louis Style Ribs, Wilbur Beans, Corn on the Cob, and a Cornbread Muffin.  The ribs were definitely finger licking good as they melted in my mouth.  The beans were savory and the cornbread had a sweetness to top off the perfect lunch/dinner (would that be considered linner?)
Anyhow, if you like BBQ and have never ate at Famous Dave's, you do not know what you are missing!"}
{"text":"I really loved the brisket. Ribs were good. Chicken was good. We ordered the all American feast. Everything was good. Only problem was that they forgot the chili. We got it delivered through UberEATS. Get your life together famous Dave"}
{"text":"My family and friends have been going to this Famous Dave's location for about 10 years.  We absolutely love it!  Every time we go there it is a great experience time and time again.  We live far away so it is a treat to get out there but we always are up for a trip to Famous Dave's!  Highly recommend their ribs to anyone, I swear the sauce is addicting.  We have also gotten take out from here and it was great also.  Staying in house is much better though just because you need the whole experience.  Always ask for a sauce explanation because it is just too much fun.  It all started 10 years ago with Famous Mike as our waiter and we have gone back time and time again excited for more!  Famous Dave's is the best!"}
{"text":"Stopped in a few  a times, great service and food every time, always felt like they care. Burnt ends are amazing and would recommend them every time!"}
{"text":"The best barbeque deal in Pheonix, Great service and delicious food. On your birthday they give you the best ice cream Sunday."}
{"text":"We have been there a few time now and have always experience great food, friendly staff.  We went there on 4/25 and the food was amazing.  They really kicked up the smoky flavor of the food which made it even better than it had ever been in prior visits.   We have not had a bad experience here during our multiple visits. I would change my rating to a five stars if they can continue to infuse the food with that great extra-smoky flavor, just the way BBQ was intended."}
{"text":"Not the place to go if you are the least bit of an epicurean. I ordered the bbq chicken breast which came to me so dry I would have needed to eat it in the rain. c n cheese its ok if you are three years old. In fact the Kraft Mac n cheese in a box is a step above what I had.

The one good thing I can say is service was was very good, and prompt.

All in all I will giver it a second shot in the future, then review again."}
{"text":"Famous Daves is excellent!!! Their BBQ items and their side dishes taste every bit as authentic as what you get at a quality BBQ restaurant in the Sourh. The ribs and chopped pork are to die for, with excellent flavor and they are smoked to perfection. The country-roasted chicken was juicy and perfectly seasoned. I absolutly loved their cole slaw and baked beans, which were both super authentic and full of flavor. They are NOT your typical store-bought sides, they are truly something special. The french fries and the corn on the cob were very good as well. I also loved their selection of high quality BBQ sauces, and I actually bought a bottle of Georgia Mustard Sauce to take home. Overall, if you love traditional Southern BBQ but you're stuck in the North, this is definatly the place to go."}
{"text":"Food was just ok, been here before and had better service and food. Manager stopped by to tell us that she didn't know why but her kitchen fell apart."}
{"text":"awesome cocktails, awesome bbq, dangerously tasty food.  service was good both times as well.  would definitely return and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Ehhhh.... Food was ok, nothing great but also not terrible. The sides of mashed potatoes and mashed potatoes were really good although I wish they would have let me know the mac & cheese had corn and pepper? Chicken sandwich was good but not amazing, tasted basic. The servers though are in need of basic training,"}
{"text":"Came with a group and had a great lunch. Lots of food and I'm stuffed. I ordered the manhandler aka chopped pork and sausage. Good sandwich but in my mind I had something else planned I guess. Service was great and food was timely. I will come back but will try a different sandwich.  Ps change the name of the sandwich."}
{"text":"Hold on to your spare ribs because there is major competition for delicious BBQ in the Chandler/Ahwatukee region. Famous Dave's is one of three different chains which I rate quite highly around here. Great meat, great sauces, and great sides. So what's the difference? Famous Dave's is more of a sit-down place than most of the other options, which offer more of a cafeteria-style situation. This has its benefits, as the service is good, and the atmosphere is a step up, but you'll pay slightly more than you might at Rudy's or another BBQ joint. Still - 4 stars, and this is a great place to come for lunch specials."}
{"text":"Waited a loooong time for someone to greet us. Only reason why we did get seated was because we grabbed one of the 6 servers ignoring us. Had to wait even more time for the server to come to our table. 

Total time lapse from walking in and when we got our food was 34 minutes. Who the heck is the manager? We didn't see any person resembling a manager the whole time we were there. This place has gone down hill. No one seems to care."}
{"text":"Great food good service had no complain on my visit I will go again For shure parking right in front smells like ribs as soon as you walk in lol .. good stuff"}
{"text":"Excellent service on a take out order.  I called to place an order for 6 adults, and it was ready within 20 minutes.  When I went to pick it up, the order was neatly packed in nice containers, and the lady actually went through my entire order to ensure it was all there and correct.
They offer curb side pick up, but there is also parking right next to the building that is marked parking only for take out orders', and once inside there is a separate pick up counter!   

The food was great!  We ordered the Georgia Pork, and also the STL RIBS!  Don't forget the Corn muffins, they are delicious!"}
{"text":"What can I say? Famous Dave's is my favorite BBQ place in Az! My wife son and I where there the other day and we got the All-American BBQ Feast half size only like $33.00. It feed all 3 of us and we took home leftovers for the next day!  

Freaking sause... Their sause is so good! I was putting a bottle of the Sweet and Zesty in my wifes purse and got cought. The nice Waitress (Alicia) then reminded me that I could purchase a bottle for only $3.50 more!  Cha-ching and I dont have to go to jail for stealing BBQ sause. Although it would have been worth it! 

St. Louis-style spareribs, Chicken, Georgia chopped pork (or Texas beef brisket which you can add for a few $$$ more) , Corn Bread, Corn on the cob, Beans, coleslaw, and Sause!  What a day.... what a day!!!!"}
{"text":"It seems the quality of the food can't quite catch up to their rising prices.  Going to take a break and look for another take out restaurant in the area for a bit.  Maybe the time away will strengthen my desire...  or not we'll see!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great waiting staff, and the drink I ordered was very good and had the right amount of liquor. I will be coming back to this place for sure!"}
{"text":"We chose Famous Dave's to cater our out door wedding reception just a few weeks ago. It was great! The BBQ was excellent and the staff that served our guests were wonderful. We highly recommend them if you want great BBQ! Thanks again."}
{"text":"Really disappointing.  Awful service, marginal food. Not sure what the heck was going on. Had to ask for water, one party at the table got 4 glasses. Almost like a, sort of slap, for asking. Not much else to say."}
{"text":"Went there for the very first time last Monday, and let me say this, I was pretty amazed with their service, and their food itself as well.  I ordered their baby back ribs, and they had a great flavor, and a great smoky taste as well.  I also had their \"Wilbur\" beans, which tasted awesome as well, and even had a good amount of bacon in it, not like the kind of beans you buy in the store that has only one tiny piece of bacon in it.  Overall, I was totally impressed when I came here for the very first time.  You can bet I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Take out last night for the family. It was a hit!! A large variety, the feast served 8.5 of us with leftovers!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!
First of all the food was so damn good! Best BBQ I've ever had. And our server Dave was one of the best we've had in a long time. Ask for him if you ever go!"}
{"text":"I went to Famous Dave's 2 days ago for a dine in on my lunch break. When I placed my order, I also placed an order for a salad to go, assuming that was enough time to make one salad to hand to me as I paid for my order. The server took forever to come hand us the check, and as he handed us the check he said that my salad would be out shortly. The salad did not come out, about 10 minutes later another server said he would go check on it. 10-15 minutes later, I still did not have the salad. I asked the server if I could just get a refund because I had to go, I was on my lunch break. He told me that the salad was ready and that his manager was coming to talk to me. The manager came and apologized and informed me they \"goofed\". He gave me coupons and said he would like to have me come back. I placed a to-go order today and used my coupon for a free order of TWELVE wings, I got to work and checked the box of wings, and there was only FIVE wings in the box. Not to mention that the manager that came up to assist with getting the coupon applied to my order, was on his cell phone and did not acknowledge me for one second. I will never be going back there again."}
{"text":"(Bump)If you want great service and awesome BBQ you should head to Logan's Roadhouse down the street located at: San Tan Village, 2649 S Market St, Gilbert, AZ 85295. Now to Racist Dave's, if I could give this place a negative star I would. I came in with my wife and 8 year old daughter.  A female staff took our name down and told us there was a 20 minute wait.   Minutes passed and I noticed people that came in after us got seated before us. Went up to ask what the deal was and they didn't even take my name down. I guess they pretended to take my name down but they made sure all the white people that came in before and after me got seated.  I know now, that at this place unless you're white you won't be getting good service. What a bunch of racist, uncivilized human beings. This place almost ruined our night but luckily we remembered that Logan's Road was just down the street.  They totally saved the night with their great service and awesome BBQ.  Thank you very much Logan's Roadhouse employee's for living in the 21st Century and leaving the racism out the door and being family  oriented."}
{"text":"I simply love this place. I am someone who hates bar b que sauce. I know, I know.. wtf right? Thing is, if I am going to eat sweet anything on meat it better be Chinese food. But this place does it right - not too sweet, not too salty, just right. ALL of their sauces are on point. I usually order the St. Louis style ribs every time and I have never been disappointed. The pulled pork is excellent as well. The rotisserie chicken has come out a little dry every time I've ordered it but nothing a little bit of the Rich and Sassy or Devils Spit sauce couldn't cure. Love the corn bread muffins too. I always order an extra one :) 

If you're in the mood for ribs this is the place to go. I eat here about once every two weeks to get my rib fix.

*Also, they honor our veterans and active duty military guys and gals on veterans day with a free meal."}
{"text":"I've always heard good things about Famous Dave's, and even though I'm skeptical of chains, I was pleasantly surprised! The BBQ here is excellent; I had the brisket, which was tender and juicy. The real highlight for me were the different sauces. Each table has eight different sauces that you can add to your meat, and they really bring a whole new level of flavor out. My buddy got the full rack of ribs, and they were tasty a well. The meat comes right off the bone, and the sauces all compliment this dish as well. Minus one star for having weak drinks, but that is to be expected at a chain. A step above Lucille's BBQ at Tempe Marketplace. Check it out!"}
{"text":"We went to this location today. I have been there once before but my Husband had not. The service was amazing! Our waiter was super friendly and knew the menu really well. As any of the other staff walked by some checked in on us but almost all said hi to our 2 year old who was hamming it up for everyone. I had the pulled chicken barbecue sandwich which was so good. My husband had a combo plate which he also loved. He said the chicken was perfectly moist and seasoned. Our daughter had a burger and fries. The burger was a little on the burnt side but she still ate it, she is two. The only reason I didn't give this review 5 stars was the kids meal being over cooked and also I was slightly disappointed there weren't more kid friendly sides. Everything was too spicy for her, except the fries or mashed potatoes. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"When we are in Arizona we always look for a Famous Dave's since everyone in the family loves BBQ.  This time we were in the area and had a late lunch/early dinner.  We took a table in the bar to keep an eye on the basketball game.  Our bartender/server was excellent - he was great with the kids, always on top of refills and seemed to know what we needed at every turn - best service we've had a in a long time! The  4 of us had the BBQ wings, the grilled chicken sandwich, pulled pork sandwich and the brisket/georgia pork plate.  The kids LOVE the mac and cheese, it has a great kick to it.  The beans were also excellent.  I love the sweet BBQ sauce, each of us had our fave.  Can't wait for the next trip to Tempe to return."}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ places in East Valley, period. All entrees range from normal BBQ to the infamous, spicy \"Wilbur's Revenge\" sauce, which I highly recommend if you can take the heat.

The environment and decor is superb, added to the friendly staff, which gives you one of the best restaraunts to go to when you're visiting the San Tan Village."}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating at this place tender meat great BBQ over all everything you have  at Dave's was delicious, sauces many to choose from love their flavor and taste, they are so good that when I was in AZ I will buy some just to keep them in the house.

If you ever come across any of this places go you will not regret it.

Just by writing this I so want good BBQ right now. :)"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. The chips are awesome for flavor testing of all the sauces on the table. Went with the sampler plate as my dinner as I wanted a taste of it all. Monday night was very little crowd. Start and end with Famous Dave pickles next to the door."}
{"text":"I had a bbq craving and this was the closest thing around... We got the combo for 2... It hit the spot for being a chain.  The \"rich and sassy\" bbq sauce was preferred.

However, our corner booth faced nothing but the to go entrance counter. I had to watch the young blonde working repeatedly pull her hair out of her hair tie, shake out her hair then run her fingers through it... Then put together someone's to go order... Then apply lipgloss, then play with her hair, then dig a crumpled bag of Doritos out of the bottom of her purse for a snack... Then play with her hair while texting.

If this is what goes on in front of customers, what happens behind that wall?!

Gross."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the prices are great and so is the customer service. It's a very warm and welcoming establishment.  I would highly recommend the brisket and the ribs. I look forward to returning and exploring more on the menu."}
{"text":"Quick, friendly service & good food. We always have a good experience here. They have happy hour & will send periodic coupons if you sign up for their email club. They have expanded their menu in the last few years with more chicken & fish options as well."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's.....ordered their top combo/feast for two about a month or so ago. Enough food for 3 easy, if not 4. I'm not really a big meat eater.  However, this place will have you licking your fingers. love the chicken and beef briskets. cornbread muffins delish....the bread pudding.....love it!"}
{"text":"Love their BBQ!!
We go there once a month.
Only complain was the service.
They dropped the food off and never came back to check on us.
They only came back once to drop the bill off and insist on buying dessert.
All of the servers are like that...hmmm."}
{"text":"I was there with some friends on Friday for lunch and the food and service was fantastic. We had the chicken and rib plate and catfish. The entrees and the side dishes were all cooked just right. The waitress was attentive and cheerful. We had a great experience and will be back again."}
{"text":"Ordered out today. Very fast, very good. I do recommend for anyone looking for good barbecue."}
{"text":"awesome BBQ. food was amazing. service was good. good place for small or big groups"}
{"text":"Love it! Best BBQ going back soon the ribs chicken. And everything delicious make you lick you're fingers"}
{"text":"Love bbq. Their devil sauce is really good and spicy. Their ribs and brisket do not disappoint."}
{"text":"This has been my family's favorite spot for years! Great food, good atmosphere. I wish i remembered his name, our server last time (~a month ago) was fantastic. Usually when you go places and ask what beer/drinks they have, they give you the typical *sigh* and say \"umm we have the usual stuff like umm budlight..\" this guy went right into it, listed them all without a complaint. He stopped by often to check on us without interrupting, was on top of refills, and i didnt feel rushed what-so-ever.. Little things like that are appreciated. The host (young man around 17-20) was not uber friendly or welcoming, but hey, you cant win them all i guess."}
{"text":"I have no major complaints with the taste, but it always seems to be a little less food than I expected.  Not bad flavor, but not like Joe's Real.

Guys from work like to go there so I've been 6-8 times.

One especially bad experience was when I ordered some sort of sampler that had catfish and I got two little \"fish sticks\" that were smaller than my little finger.  When I asked about it they brought me 2 more little pieces.  

Also they have those stupid food baskets with the raised bottom so the basket you get looks like it's overflowing and then when you eat the food so see it was an illusion.  It's probably all the food I need, but I don't like feeling like I was tricked."}
{"text":"What the heck is going on at this location, I hope they figure it out soon. Over the past 3 months we have dined at this location 4 times. The first time I ordered a Dave's Sassy Barbeque Salad, it was awful. I can tell you exactly how it was made; they open a bag of lettuce chopped up some chicken threw in a bowl. The manager came over and asked how everything was. I said, since you asked I'm going to tell you. I did. He came back with some tomatoes, cucumbers and cheese and removed it from our check. He tried. Including today, the service stinks. The waitresses come over take your order. They come by and drop the the drinks off and the muffins you ordered, with no plates or butter and then they run off. They threw your food at you. We are not pigs, we are your customers we need napkins, plates, and silverware. Then you have to wave them down an ask for napkins, plates, silverware and butter they look at you like \"what is your problem\". Then someone else brings you your order and only bring 1/2 the order. Then you wait some more. Today, the food was not very good. The hamburger meat was not seasoned like it has been in the past. They service was awful. What I did notice today the people were not lined up waiting like they have been in the past. We will not be going back again for awhile. There waitresses need to learn to stop throwing the food at the customers and bring to food to the table with a smile and set it down in front of each person. Then ask if everyone has everything they need before they run away."}
{"text":"Authentic, perhaps not, yummy?- you bet!  

Famous Dave's is a little hokey, a little fakey, but still...the Dave's Ultimate Burger with bacon and chopped pork on top of an enormous burger is literally to die for!  My personal fave is the Georgia chopped pork- as a platter it's a whole pile of food for ten bucks.  the Mr. really loves the bread pudding on the rare occasion we order dessert!"}
{"text":"Eat lunch here a few times a month. Haven't had a bad meal yet. Always eat in the bar. Tom is awesome. Doesn't matter how busy it is, he always has a smile on his face and something great to say."}
{"text":"Just finished my $50 meal for 4 (could habe been advised the family pack was a better deal for me, but naaaah, why do that? ).....and of course the order was not correct...and it was mine, the one who ordered and picked up. I asked for my brisket to be sliced and it came chopped. It had HUGE chunks of gristle in it. I was rushed through my order as well. No wonder they like to chop it, they dont have to care if its all fat! EVERY BITE i took had huge gulps of gristle in them. So grossed out. Never going back. Thanks for taking care on my order! Also, there was nobody else in there when i walked in. Ine other family came in, why couldn't time be taken?. Don't waste your money. Go to smashburger next door."}
{"text":"Full... so... full!!

It was over 36 hours ago that I had Famous Dave's BBQ... and I'm STILL full!! I was frustrated with my so-called-friends of my so-called-LIFE! and I decided to seek a nice evening instead a drama-filled night of pulling  Chinese Fire Drills on the southside of town. So I hollared at the sis and consulted Yelp to see where a great BBQ place is... Dave's was at the top of the list.

After hours and hours of texting - we were set! We got there on a Friday evening at around 7pm or so and there were several parties ahead of us, naturally. We were told it was a 25 minute wait. So we went outside to play with my new camera. Not even 15 minutes later - we were called to out table. YAY!

We sat down and I immediately started the BBQ Sauce taste test! Pouring them onto what was apparently where our used bones go. (ew) We tasted each kind and chose our favorites. Their Sweet & Zesty and Rich & Sassy (is that right?) sauces were my faves. I couldn't hang with the Geogria Mustard sauce nor could I take the devil's spit. I looove hot food, but I wasn't feeling the sauce. The Texas Pit was CRAZY-AWESOME! but it just didn't mesh well with the flavor of the bbq. 

I was lobbying for The Feast the entire way there!! and YESSS... the sis and cousin agreed!! I had to ask the intertribal table battle cry... Are you HUNGRY... or are you STARVING?!?! the answer is ALWAYS starving!! haha!! 

While an ENTIRE chicken, a WHOLE slab of pork ribs and half a briskit  were being prepared along with our corn on the cob, cole slaw, beans, french fries & corn bread muffins... we dined on fried catfish. Seriously - I didn't dig it. I think it was the flavor of the fish itself but the sauce it came with tasted pretty rad especially when mixed with the Texas Pit sauce! :)

And then... The Feast arrived! Served on a trash can lid... that I'm PRAYING has atleast been hosed off before hitting our table! :P It was HUGE, it was beautiful! :D I'm sooo glad we ordered it! We each grabbed our tong (it came with three) and we just dug in! I had two plates of food and I was STUFFED! I was in hog heaven!! I had several ribs and the BEST briskit i ever HAD!! The meat was perfect - the biggest letdowns was in the side dishes.

The corn was obviously frozen at one time - but still good. The beans were oniony (i don't like onions) so I didn't dig 'em. the fries were VERY salty... but still good. I wish we could have had more cornbread muffins. But I MUST say - the cole slaw was probably the best I have EVER had! Crazy yummy!

At the end of the meal - we couldn't hang. There was a huge amount of chicken left and and a few ribs and a TON of fries and we didn't even touch the beans. We took home two to-go boxes and still left some food on the our trusty trash can lid. We got to the car, to-go boxes in hand and I just wanted to lower the seat and just SLEEP! It was so good!!

I will DEFINATLY be back! It was crazy yummy. There were serious smoke rings in their ribs! their sauces were tasty and had zing to spare! Their prices were a lil high. (nearly $60 for The Feast!) but it was worth EVERY penny!! I am such a fan, I cannot imagine ever venturing into Chandler Mall's food court again with Famous Dave's being just a few steps away!"}
{"text":"For a chain BBQ place, they seem to do just fine. I eat a lot of BBQ all over the country and this place is always good and consistent. It doesn't get the 5 stars like some of my favorites in KC but that's ok. I have probably eaten at Famous Dave's 30 times and never been disappointed with the food. Sometimes you get a server that can't do their job but that's to be expected with a chain. Nice to see they still make it happen after getting so large."}
{"text":"The food was great, and service was even better.  Place gets packed so there tends to be a line.  But well worth it"}
{"text":"Go for happy hour.  The rib tip platter is really good.  You dont get alot of meat but you get alot of flavor. I recommend the stillhouse sangria too.  Its a peach sangria that is really refreshing on a hot day."}
{"text":"We are always happy when we leave the Peoria location, this one was close to an event we were going to and I'd been here once before so I thought it'd be a good place to try. 

Both my burnt ends and her brisket were room temperature. We told the manager who was nice enough to offer replacements, (I'd already eaten half my food so it'd be a waste to get more for me) but my girlfriends brisket burger came much faster than when we had first ordered it. 

The brisket for her replacement looked terrible, like they quickly cooked some trimmings they'd originally planned to throw away, and tasted weird. She didn't eat more than half a bite. 

We had to go and didn't want to take up anymore time, they comped her meal (she didn't eat either burger) and with tip I paid over $20 for one room temperature plate of meat that was actually eaten with some fries. 

We'll stay with the Peoria locations from now on."}
{"text":"Love this place, the meat is great especially the St. Louis Ribs (is that right?) heaven, the corn bread is to die for. Didn't care for the corn on the cob either time I've tried to eat it. The green beans have a great taste (bacon!) but overcooked to my taste. But really who needs veggies and grains when you have smoked meat?"}
{"text":"Great place for Bar B Que, not like most chain restaurants. Famous Dave is soooo
 good, it a make'ya wanta slap your momma IT'S JUST THAT GOOD. 
Staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Everyone has been talking about this place ever since I moved here 10 years ago. I finally gave in and went to Famous Dave's for dinner! I have to say it was okay, nothing impressive. Don't understand why everyone swears it the best. If the price was a little more fair for what they serve, then I would say its a pretty decent joint. Overall, i left disappointed. Enough said."}
{"text":"We recently tried Famous Dave's in Chandler.  Normally, we try to go to mom and pops as opposed to chains, but Famous Dave's beats the mom and pop in the East Valley by a mile.  Unbelievable great bbq at reasonable prices.  We used to be able to say that about Honey Bears, but not lately.  Too bad as Honey Bears has been around a long time.  St. Louis ribs, baked potato, tasty slaw, Zesty and Tangy bbq sauce.  

Only one complaint, no white bread.  Not everybody likes corn bread believe me.  So, we supply our own white bread at home."}
{"text":"I've been to this Daves MANY times since my first review and tonight I had a rare bad experience with their brisket, it was either the first slice or the last from the whole and it had several really thick muscle like pieces that were inedible. I was really disappointed and if this happens again I'll be telling the manager to get me another servicing if he expects me to pay."}
{"text":"Everything about famous faves in chandler was amazing from the food to the customer Service we received from the employees. The manager was so attentive to the guest he even greeted us when we came in and he also seated us. I would recommend this particular famous daves to anyone."}
{"text":"Im typically not a fan of chain restaurants but i must say Im pleasantly surprised by this place. We started with the burnt ends which were really good. I recommend trying them. We also got the dinner for 2 which is a really good deal for the price."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch a couple of times and have been impressed by the food and the portion sizes.  I have tried the boneless wings with buffalo sauce and the Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad.

The wings were typical boneless wings, they had a good portion of breading to chicken and were nice and crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  I would definitely try them again.

The salad, a lunch portion, was perfect size for lunch.  The Caesar dressing was a bit watered down with a too 'lemony' flavor, but the anchovy flavor was good, not too strong, but provided the hint of taste it is supposed to. The lettuce - typical romaine, but fresh, clean and crisp. The chicken - served cut up and in a side bowl, which is good because it's still warm and this way it doesn't wilt the lettuce. It has good flavor, cooked perfectly, moist and juicy on the inside.

I have tried two of their bbq sauces - the Devil's Spit - it's spicy, gives a kick in the beginning and a little more burn after a few seconds, but if you're a hot sauce freak like me, this will probably not be hot enough.  The Rich and sassy - has a bit of a vinegary taste, but not overly strong, it was good. I liked both of the sauces, but think they could have been a little thicker."}
{"text":"My party was seated next to the most irritating screaming baby. Food was excellent, service was great. Manager did what he could to quiet baby, wait staff came out tried to assist in calming baby. It felt like someone was scratching at a chalkboard with bare nails. Bottom line the crying baby wasn't their fault and they did attempt to remedy the problem. I eat out every night but I will request a corner or at bare minimum look at my neighboring tables and scan for unruly kids."}
{"text":"They have Happy Hour on Sunday from 3-6 , the food items offered look good. I'm getting the chili and catfish tacos for a total of $5"}
{"text":"I've eaten Dave's in the past but this was my first time at this location. It's always a bit busy which is no issue, since they are pretty good BBQ place. There was a bit of an issue that day I came to this location though. I had \"reserved\" my place with the hostess up at the front and she informed me it would be a 30 minute wait. Ok, cool. That was fine with us. We waited out in the \"lobby\" area for about 5 minutes and we decided we would get some drinks at the bar while we waited for our name to be called. We had told the hostesses of our plans and they understood so we went got out drinks and waited some more. We noticed that people that were the same size of party as us that arrived later were being called back. So we went up to the front just to check on things. Apparently the hostesses got the idea to CROSS OUR NAMES OFF THE LIST because we to the bar area to wait. I didn't get that assumption because I was watching them come back to the bar area numerous times calling for people's parties before they went outside the building to see if they were out there. Other than that the food was good, as it always is."}
{"text":"My husband I have come here before for the awesome Happy Hour! But that will be no more.  The Happy Hour has been revamped - the wings were removed and the costs went up. The service itself is always great for us, but now my husband has banned Famous Dave's.  BYE BYE Famous Dave's it was fun while it lasted."}
{"text":"The bbq sauce presentation at the beginning was both entertaining and helpful.  The actual food is what you expect from a good quality controlled restraunt."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I leave extremely full and satisfied.

The decor is very fun with pigs and jokes everywhere. The service is friendly and efficient.

I tend to have the meat baskets, but this time I tried Dave's Favorite burger. It has bacon, jack cheese, Rich and Sassy sauce, and the regular burger toppings. I put a little Texas Pit sauce on top, and it was extraordinary!

They offer a lot of different meats, sides, and sauces, so there are tons of combinations that you can try. Portion size is generous.

I will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"I used to have fond memories of dining at Famous Dave's, perhaps it was before I got on the BBQ bandwagon, back to when I believed this was BBQ.

But over the years, the meat has gotten more fatty and portions have been significantly reduced. 

So today, to avoid having a side of meat with my bun, I went for the order of a pound of Georgia Chopped Pork $11.99, with a side of Wilbur Beans $2.29. 

This is the way to go if you're a meat lover and want a filling lunch. The heaping pile of pork was drizzled with tangy BBQ sauce, and for the price, I can do without the choice of two sides and a corn bread if I would've ordered the classic meal (and cheaper than the $12.99 they charge for the entree) - trust me this is a wayyyy better deal.

I still had more than 1/2 lb of meat left, enough portions to probably make two of their prepared sandwiches at $9.49 each.

The meat wasn't perfect, I did have to pick through the fat and skin. 

The staff are very nice and helpful, all of our to go orders were accurate and correctly labeled. They even included extra packets of sauce, wet naps, ketchup packets, and utensils."}
{"text":"Food was great and there delivery to your car was easy and a very cool option!!!! Great place to eat. Food was ready when were told and the Cheryl was very friendly when she brought the food out!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here a few times, had my in-laws the last time we are here on Monday, I like the manhandler sand which. Service is always good and the food is reasonably priced good tasting, only complaint is that it's always a little chilly in the restaurant in the fall/winter"}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ restaurant.  I was introduced to this Famous Dave's many years ago by some very good friends.  Now I come here often for the amazing ribs that are truly smoked, not just given lip service on a grill. The sides definitely make the meal here.  I always enjoy the delicious corn bread muffins, coleslaw, baked beans and Mac & cheese.  The service is excellent and the staff is very friendly and attentive. I'LL BE BACK!!"}
{"text":"Good consistent BBQ. The portions are hefty and the prices seem reasonable. I really like that they have so many sauces to choose from and that they have paper towels at the tables. Not much more to say, I mean, it's a chain but the food is pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town. The feast for two is amazing tons of good food. The pulled pork and ribs are moist and the devil spit sauce is super tasty. Even the corn muffins and beans are extra good. Kind of noisy inside but there is a. Ice patio. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great BBQ exists in Mesa, AZ because of Famous Dave's. The service was great, and the food was even greater. I ordered the St. Louis Ribs Combo with the Georgia chopped pork. Both were delicious! For the sides, I had the beans and the mac & cheese. No complaints here. Just come with an empty stomache, so that it can be made FULL!"}
{"text":"My friend and her daughter were in town from Japan and she was craving BBQ.  I thought about this place and now feel really bad.  We all ordered lunch combo's.  The service was slow and lackluster and the only good food on the plate were the corn muffins.  They were awesome however the ribs were not tender as all and the chicken was dry.  Very disappointing.  The chips they brought out with the drinks had no flavor at all.  I wouldn't go back there for the bbq but would order a dozen corn muffins in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I was starving that day, wanted to eat something different . My wifey is not a BBQ so I told her lets go for lunch. So we agree , well got the big platter corn, beans coleslaw salad, ribs , chicken , brisket I was holy cow I mean holy Pig.... that was a huge platter my girls loved it my wife was impressed , she love the Idea pouring your own BBQ sauce and flavors and so did I , that was my first time there Loved it and we are coming back for more ....... Yum !"}
{"text":"Last week, my mom and I ate at this Famous Dave's store.  The food was excellent.  We commented on how little fat was on the brisket.  We had such a good meal that we looked forward to going back.
     We returned for dinner today.  We had a very different experience.  The brisket was mostly fat.  It was terrible!  The manager replaced our brisket but it was no better than the first order.  Such a disappointment!  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Seated quickly next to family with a cute baby. Babies are messy, I get it. Food, napkins all over the floor where baby was sitting. Not appealing. Husband ordered tea, whisky lemonade for me. Did not care for my drink, added sweet and low to help the flavor. We got burnt ends for appetizer. Maybe got about 7 small pieces with 4 pickles, pickled onion, and fried onion strings for $11.99. Don't think we will order that again. Too expensive for what we got . Server took main order. Two families sat after us and got their food 30 minutes before us (we ordered the same as them so my husband said something) server apologized and assured us manager will bring. 10 minutes later, no food. I went to restroom, peeked in kitchen, no manager, no food. Thankfully food was there when I got back. Other families around us received free chips. We didn't. Server apologized but still never brought any. Food was ok, nothing to rave about. All in all, I don't think it was worth the $75 we dropped on the meal."}
{"text":"The food was excellent this was the second time i been to  Dave's the reason i gave it a 4 was the service..  It was my family first time there and the server .They have a lunch menu and regular menu the lunch menu.  Once the server realized that we were ordering from lunch menu getting her to help was pulling teeth.  they have 6 bbq sauces she was irked that i ask her tell my parents and gma sauces she wanted take order before showing the sauces.  Well gma was sensitive to spice.  After meal delivered getting her attention for refill and adjustment to meal we needed a flare gun get her attention.  It was a complete flip from when me and my husband went about month ago.   I would go  back and cross fingers that I would not get that server again."}
{"text":"Place is disgusting my Georgia pork tasted like soap the  chicken wings weren't cooked enough they were still slimy like I was really disappointed considering I go to the one in Illinois all the time and it's excellent but this place gives famous Dave's a horrible look now on the brighter side the corn bread and corn was really really good but overall I wouldn't waste my money never again"}
{"text":"Great place! It was so good we went two nights in a row. I liked the catfish, ribs & brisket. The Rich & Sassy sauce was the best. Had to get some for the grillin' friends back home. Glad to see they're in California, too!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best BBQ especially for a chain. I particularly love their st.louis ribs and the brisket. Although,I will admit the brisket is hit or miss and some days can be a little dry. They offer complimentary home cooked potato chips while your order arrives which is great since I'm always starving lol. I usually go for lunch. They have a great lunch special that include two meats, a side, and cornbread for 9.95. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent....service sub par. Long wait for our meals....had two different waitresses.... seemed confused...... but the brisket was melt in your mouth!!"}
{"text":"Well, I really like this place but it has fantastic days and ok days! Today was an ok day!  I had a dinner salad with romaine lettuce, which sometimes is green and delicious but today was all the stem ends-WHITE, which means practically no nutrition compared to the general and less appetizing! I also ordered the happy hour regular chicken wings with sweet and zesty sauce. The picture on the happy hour menu shows a basket with about 8-10 wings, but I got a plate with 4 1/2 wings, one was literally cut in half! The sauce was definitely pineapple rage, which I like so I ate them. The wings cost $4.00, so I don't consider that a happy hour deal and false advertising,  misleading menu. The bartender Chenin was great as always, she was a bright spot in a dismal day!"}
{"text":"I've dined in and it was ok. I also have taken home twice, not so good. Idk. Never cared for it."}
{"text":"I've been eating lunch at this location for 6 years.  In the last 2 months I've noticed a sudden \"portion control\" infesting the business.  Today the double meat platter had a dollop of Georgia pulled pork.  3 bites worth tops before it was gone.  This is maybe 1/8 the size it has been for decades.  2 months ago it was noticeably half sized from normal, but now it's ridiculous.  I'm not sure if there is a new manager who is trying to win brownie points with corporate by shortchanging the portions they give the paying customers, but his short sighted thinking will result in the closing of this location in the long run (probably 2018 at this rate).

The bartender, manager, and cook all seemed to be sniping at one another over everything from placement of a bar mat to what channel the tv should be on.  Each were complaining to the other that people were sitting on the patio (gee, it's finally under 90 in Phoenix for the first time in 8 months.  And, if you don't want people on your patio... DON'T HAVE A PATIO!)

I ate here once a week for years but today was the end.  RIP Dave's.  Wish I could say I'll be sad when this location closes but, you brought it upon yourselves."}
{"text":"So I was craving bbq a while ago and asked my lunch buddy to try this place with me. He looked at me funny and said \"YOU have never been there??\" So off we went. Famous Dave's has the regular decor you would expect at a BBQ joint; wooden furniture, country decor... very standard. We were greeted and seated quickly. A VERY flustered waitress came to our table nearly out of breath and asked \"Have you guys been helped yet??\" I sighed silently, bracing myself for poor service. To my relief a very polite waiter came over and said that he had taken our table and would be very happy to help us. GOOD call!
Our waiter could not have been more polite and fast. I just wish I could remember his name because he was awesome!

I was famished so I got the baby back and meat combo. For the meat I chose the hot link sausage. Our waiter explained each of the sauces that were on our table to us. He even told us our food would arrive in 5-10 minutes. DING! 8 minutes later, my food had arrived in front of me. With the meat, I got two sides which were macaroni and cheese, and green beans. Man was everything good! The ribs were nice and tender, the hot link was smoky, but not terribly spicy. It was so good! The macaroni and cheese is REAL macaroni and cheese. If you eat comfort food, you know what I mean. The green beans had potato and onion in them which is yet another southern touch! I loved everything and it was a lot of food. 

I don't know if I can make Famous Dave's a regular stop, but I would love to! I will return there again next time I'm craving good bbq!"}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for BBQ, this is my go to spot. The other BBQ spot down the street was not my cup of tea to say the least. I like their pulled pork, St. Louis style ribs, chicken wings, rib tips, cornbread, chicken salad, french fries and loaded mashed potatoes.

The service has always been very good, dining in or take out. Their meat is consistently good and that is so hard to find nowadays. If you are into BBQ and haven't tried them yet, I'd recommend them over any other BBQ place I have tried in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Wanted some good bbq and found this place on Yelp. This was my first time here.  The girl doing the to go was so polite and really had great customer service skills. She was so sweet. Ordered the feast for two, cost about $40.  When I got the food I was shocked. This was the most food I have ever seen in a portion! This thing must have weighed 10 pounds at least. OMG. The cornbread was AMAZING. I chose corn on the cobb, coleslaw, and baked beans as my sides. the meat consisted of chicken, ribs, and tri tip. I thought the tri tip was not good. very fatty.  The ribs were great. The chicken was okay.  The only thing that was disappointing was the bbq sauces. I tried two of them. One was so spicy I couldn't even eat it. The other was ok. Would I go back? Yes, definitely. There are more sauces you can choose from if you dine in. Overall I was impressed. Check it out."}
{"text":"Personally, I think this is the best BBQ in the valley. Unfortunately, they lost a star because the service is very hit and miss."}
{"text":"We always get great food and service,  even when it's crowded. We live coming here for BBQ, our favorite are their ribs and brisket. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I have a tendency to automatically think less of franchises when it comes to eating establishments. It's an unfair bias, for sure, but it is what it is.  With that said, I have frequented Famous Dave's on a number of occasions and have not once been disappointed in the food.  

Dave's has become my go-to BBQ joint when I need BBQ in a pinch.  Keep in mind, I grew up near Memphis, so I am pretty particular.  Sure, I can drive out of the way to a stand-alone BBQ and get more authentic Q, but sometimes you just want it quick, and you want it with six cornbread muffins.  

Dave's fits the bill. The ingredients are high quality, the helpings heaving.  Their meats, whether it's brisket, pulled pork, chicken, etc. are always tender and delicious."}
{"text":"This location seems to have poor customer service & the wait staff dies not seem to care for the customers. 
On this most recent visit, I ordered a drink & our server has ignored us for most of the time we have sat here.  The other patrons around us have his attention, but everytime I try to wave him down he ignores me.  I only saw the manager walk around once but hasn't seen him around since. 

I live near by, but with there customer service I would rather go to the Mesa Riverview location. They are more friendlier there & are always on top of things. 

Don't get me wrong, the food at Dave's is good, I'm just disappointed on the 3 different visits to this location have all been the same."}
{"text":"I really like Famous Dave's but I'm VERY disappointed that they stopped serving Catfish Fingers. My friend's granddaughter came here from CA and wanted to go there just because she loves them. We got they only to find they don't have them at all now. For some STRANGE reason they have been removed completely from the menu...and I didn't buy that it's a supply issue, catfish are farm raised and no other restaurants I know of stopped serving them.  We're going to a different restaurant today because of that."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food. Had a brisket salad and three people could have eaten from it. Every part of the evening was delightful."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed...
First they have no turkey?
I ordered a beef brisket sandwich but they have no whole wheat buns?
I ordered the green beans and they were tasteless and cold.
The sandwich was good.
The ice tea was terrible and came out of a machine for gods sake?"}
{"text":"I received an email with a promotion for free order of wings with any entree.  I called & ordered the Big Slap which is $25.93 including tax; however, they can't put in the order for the free wings unless I'm there physically to show them the email offer.  So, I came & showed them the email.  Got my order & paid.  But when I checked the wings, there were only 4 wings.  There is no where in the offer to specify only 4 wings.  No point of arguing with false advertisement from this place.   BEWARE of false advertisement.  I was going to return the order but it's not fair to employees.  I will definitely not be ordering any of their promotional offers."}
{"text":"I used to like Famous Dave's a lot more than I do now, but it's still an alright place. I think I am done ordering the burger here, because it is not very good. Their BBQ has been pretty decent though and their service is usually up to par, which makes a difference.

It's not a place that I am overly excited to keep coming back to, but I am sure I will be back someday to see if they can impress me yet."}
{"text":"Been to Famous Dave's all over the country and they're always dope. Went with the wife and kid for the rib tips and we shared a sample platter. Everything was hot and juicy and delicious. The sauces are bomb too. Staff was attentive and friendly. Famous Dave's is always a great place to go."}
{"text":"So, I've never eaten inside the restaurant here. I've only had food to go. Be advised, even if you call in your order, it'll still have a long wait. I called in an order at 4:40pm, for pick up at 6. I didn't have it until about 6:45pm. Parking was and is always atrocious. People are circling the parking lots like sharks going in for a kill. 

We like the food. It's usually pretty good. We get burnt ends and rib tips. This time the burnt ends were super fatty, and the portion was disappointingly small. Normally it's larger. The cornbread is pretty good. It tasted just like that \"jiffy cornbread\" mix though, so it's not amazing or anything. Their macaroni and cheese is pretty gross. It's disappointing. 

The different BBQ sauces are pretty good. The pickled onions and pickles are always good."}
{"text":"Went in tonite with wifey and family of four service was good and quick food was good but not great. Bark on the beef was salty smoke flavor tasted unclean a little too earthy almost dirty tasting.ribs were good probably far from the advertised best in america but good, spent about 80 bucks. Wont be doing the famous daves again for a while. Its surprising how packed it was. Guess i have to respect the game"}
{"text":"First time at a Famous Dave's. 
*Food*
I ordered the 1/2 rack of babyback ribs with fries and sweet corn. My husband ordered the two meat platter with brisket, and bbq chicken. His two sides were the Mac and cheese, and sweet corn. 
Babyback ribs- great flavor, a little tuff tho. 
Mac and cheese- amazing, was told would be spicy but it's not. 
Bbq chicken- perfect 
Brisket- tender overall amazing 
Sweet corn- great flavor but tastes frozen 
Fries(wedges)- great ! 

*Service*
Katie.. Amazing, always kept my glasses full. Very attentive. Recommend her 100%
Manager even gave us a 10$ gift card for our next visit ! We will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"EH.....Items on their menu are definitely hit or miss.  Burgers are great as are the ribs but I would stay away from the tri tip.  their spicy wings are really spicy and would be great with some ranch but the ranch they brought us tasted more like blue cheese, YUCK!"}
{"text":"So far, NOT so good.  Our waiter ignored us and we had to snag another who just happened to catch my eye and asked if he could help.  Hopefully the food will be worth the frustration.

Well they redeimed themselves.  The food was great and our new waiter was the best!  You gotta try the banana pudding.  It rocked."}
{"text":"I went to dinner there this evening. There wasn't a wait so we where able to go right in. We ordered and within 10mins. We received our food. I noticed how dried out the ribs where and the bottom of one of my pieces of chicken was charcoal black burnt. I notified the waitress and she did at least take them and bring me fresh ones... Just seems like the quality of the food has really gone down... At least the service was ok.."}
{"text":"Really good barbeque and a nice atmosphere sometimes the music can be a little to loud for conversation. We usually go with another couple and order the big tray of food it comes on a garbage can lid and the platter for 2 is big enough for 4 with food left over."}
{"text":"HUGE portions!  Food was very good as well!  One of the better BBQ places in town!"}
{"text":"The brisket is addicting! The smokey sweet flavor and meat melts in your mouth. Love the sweet & tangy sauce. Yumm."}
{"text":"Not real bbq...burnt ends were like cubes of spam smothered in bbq sauce.  Ribs had no meat.  Mac n cheese sub par. Beans tasted like they were out of a can.  Sorry....won't be coming back."}
{"text":"okay, so went there last night.  good crowd, great service, excellent portion size, in fact too much food.  tasty, and well worth the price.  I liked it, and would go again."}
{"text":"Went the other day because I read all the positive posts. I must say I was not impressed. I had the pulled pork and it was not tender at all. 

When I brought this to my waiters attention he seemed put out that I complained.  I've had way better BBQ....maybe I just had bad luck."}
{"text":"We were on the way to eat at Cracker Barrel when we ran into Famous Dave in the same shopping mall. We decided to do a turn around as the reviews about the Cracker Barrel weren't too enticing. We came about 3 PM on a Saturday and were surprised that the restaurant had quite a few diners in both the bar and restaurant area.

As soon as we sat down our waiter greeted us and gave us our menus. When I asked if they had smaller lunch special portions, I was pleasantly surprised to find out they did. So instead of usually ordering a $15.99 meal it went down to half that price for a two meat combo.

Having eaten at the Las Vegas Flamingo location for many years we were very familiar with the menu. I always ordered the 2 meat combo with the ribs and hot links and my husband the 2 meat combo with brisket and chicken.

When our food came out I was ready to dig in as I was famished but the food came out the way I don't like it and that was lukewarm. Food that isn't hot is a complete turn off.

Rather then complain and having to wait for them to reheat or make another order, I just picked at it and decided to take home most of the food to eat at another time. The taste of the food is consistent with the other locations we've eaten at, it is what it is. The only thing that needed major improvement was the coleslaw, it was so drippy and not at all fresh tasting. I took one fork full and immediately stopped eating it. 

This restaurant is very nicely maintained, the bathrooms spotless and we got good service. Now we know where this location is we'll try to return and hope our $30 plus lunch meal comes out hot next time."}
{"text":"1st time there the other day and it was great! Loved the baby back ribs and the baked apples and the beans were delicious"}
{"text":"Great food and service. We had plenty to eat and a birthday sundae. Our server Travis H was awesome. Always on point and we never had to ask twice about anything! Next time I'm in AZ I'm gonna have to come back and eat just cause of the great service I received"}
{"text":"As a first timer, I felt great in the presence of Famous Matt! He had killer recommendations, and amazing beer knowledge! I ended up trying the Sampler and a Famous Daves Lemonade! Definitely going to be my go-to lunch spot. Can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"I know I'm new to the Cleveland food scene, but I don't really understand the appeal of this place. Yes, the service was friendly and the price was fair. And the BBQ sauces were pretty good. But unfortunately I felt I had to drown the pulled pork in the sauce to give it any flavor. Oddly the meat was both dry and fatty...not something I've experienced before. And the sides of baked beans, mashed potatoes, and mac & cheese (which I sent back) were meh at best. I guess my quest for good barbecue will continue somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my bff, her hubby, my 15 month old daughter and myself. Daryl was our waiter who was excellent. Made great suggestions for food which we had the Georgia chopped pork and Texas brisket. Their coleslaw so delicious and I'm not a coleslaw person at all. Overall great food and great service thanks to our waiter Daryl"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed coming here for years. However my last nights dinner was horrible. We were seated in the bar and the waiter was very friendly at first but after taking our order and bringing us a salad I had to wait 20 minutes just to be able to eat my salad because he never came by for me to tell him that we never got silverware. We got The chopped pork and it was completely full of just skin and fat there was hardly any actual meat that was edible. When we finally were able to get the waiter back over to let him know he took it back and told us he was going to say we didn't like the pork we asked for it to be lien but when I came back it was the exact same way. We ended up hardly eating any of it and leaving pretty much everything on the plate. It was very unpleasant visit after many very good visit. To top it off we go home in the family has food poisoning. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Loaded bbq chips, devils spit burger, and a red rover Irish red beer goes hand in hand in hand customer service is always a key thing for me, and they were all over it."}
{"text":"really  good  ribs  love em there  a lil outa my way but  there worth it  they make the best Ribbs around  you gotta  try em prices are ok too"}
{"text":"This place is so good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I love BBQ and it is hard to find good BBQ.  This place has so of the best BBQ in town."}
{"text":"Hands down the best ribs out there.  Their variety of great sauces speak for themselves, trust me.  Oh, and I don't like mac and cheese or coleslaw at restaraunts, but upon visiting famous dave's, they recommended and even went so far as to bring out small bowls to allow me to try.  I can not believe that both of those what normally are terrible food choices, are actually really really good.  I have returned over and over again since and this is the kind of place that you can take anyone and they will walk out smiling."}
{"text":"This is a very hard review to write for one simple reason - When I moved to Arizona from northern Indiana I really didn't know what good BBQ was.  I didn't even know the difference between BBQ'ing and grilling.  My first visit to Dave's I thought, \"Wow, this IS real BBQ.\"  Over the years I have learned the difference, the different types and have done much research on the topic.  I have explored the difference between using sauce and dry rubs, different woods used, about everything you could imagine.  Now, several years later, I have my own smoke pit in my backyard, I know I prefer dry rubs over sauce, Texas over Carolina sauce and the list goes on.  After this last visit (only reason we went is because it was close to the BassPro Shop) I realized that Dave's is not what I thought it was in the beginning.  Don't get me wrong the bartender we had was awesome.  He was funny, sarcastic and super attentive.  I would give him alone 5 stars.  The food, I just like it the way I cook it and not the way it is done here.  I may have inadvertently turned into a BBQ snob....ooops!"}
{"text":"If you are lucky enough to get the new girl, Brigitte, you are in for a treat. She is the best waitress in the whole place, and probably any restaurant, anywhere.

The food doesn't need a review, everyone already knows its the best BBQ in Phoenix. Bring a few friends and split a garbage pail!"}
{"text":"Our server Cole was personable but not obtrusive!  BBQ delectable as always!   Side salad is plenty for two and the drunkin apples are  so tasty!"}
{"text":"I few days after I posted this review I was contacted by the manager who explained that my meat was cut incorrectly and that was not how they normally cut brisket. He invited me back to the restaurant and comp my brisket. It was great, truly the best in the area."}
{"text":"This was my second time going to a Famous Dave's. The first time it was in Manhattan, Kansas and the food was to die for and service was great!  So I decided to try  the Mesa,Az location.Well I had a problem with my food when it was brought out and I told the waitress. The manager came out and said he was sorry and a new plate will be made. It was and it was delicious! I'm not going to mention what was wrong with my food all I can say was they made it right. They took care of us and that's all that matters. Will I come again absolutely. Thank you LL and the manager. Kudos for you."}
{"text":"we just moved from california and wanted to eat bbq ribs and so glad to have found this stop.. delcious, clean and awesome customer service! thanks to jojo for making us feel welcomed!"}
{"text":"I think we have found our favorite barbecue restaurant.  

The ribs at Famous Dave's are fantastic!  I ordered the whole rack and I'm glad I did because I had plenty to bring home, which I vacuum sealed and ate later on.  They had just the right smokiness to them and the ribs were so meaty, moist and delicious that I really did stuff myself as best I could, quite frankly.  Then, just when you think things couldn't be much better, they had mac and cheese that was made with jalapenos and corn.  What a great idea!  I was in heaven!  The coleslaw was fresh and tasted great with the mac.  As soon as the server put the plate in front of me and I saw that coleslaw, I knew it was going to be a winner because the colors were vibrant and it didn't look like it sat in the fridge for a day or two, like some restaurants. 

I ordered a pecan pie for dessert and it was okay but not super great but it was warmed and had plenty of pecans.  It came with a nice little scoop of vanilla ice cream and a huge puff of whipped cream.  I made sure everyone had a spoon because I didn't want to be the only one eating it, that's for sure.  

I can't wait to go back.  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"This is decent BBQ. Basically, if you really want some BBQ, and you're in Madison, WI, this will be fine. I've just had a whole lot better.

The BBQ is average. The flavor is pretty good, the meat is iffy, and the food seems sloppily prepared. It's almost like they could earn another star if they only took the 3 extra minutes to properly prepare the food before it comes to the table - pick out some good slices of pickles, arrange the meat neatly on the bun so it isn't falling off onto the plate, etc. It feels lazy - and they can afford to be because there is little competition in town.

Other bad things - their pop is gross. I don't know if I just caught them on a bad day, but I hate flavorless pop like this. The service was okay. A whole 10 min passed between the time I was finished and the time I got the check, and it was not because they were busy. I did get my food pretty quick though.

Overall - average at best, and certainly unimpressive today."}
{"text":"Went there for an early dinner.  Place is clean and lots of staff.  Here's the problems:  server was wearing overpowering hand lotion; definite no-no in the industry.  Sat right next to host station and watched as the host blew his nose then promptly picked up menus and plates and sat a party.  Ribs were not exactly \"fall off the bone tender\", rather tough.  Burgers were over cooked and tasteless.  Server was attentive but nothing special.  Probably would not return because I just wasn't impressed enough."}
{"text":"Cole the Bartender  is one of the all time best , coldest beer good food.  Loved it here, he changed the TV to my game and all was good.fast service. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Worth breaking the diet for. Fub place, clean and nice staff. I used to think you had to to get BBQ from a hole in the wall \"joint\" but Dave changed that"}
{"text":"Visited 12/15/13.

Still very much a fan. I always seem to get a good meal when I need a fix for BBQ. 

One thing I did not on last meal...
Ordered Burnt Ends and Rib combo.  Unfortunately, these were not Burnt Ends. Too soft and a little fatty. It was still good, but not what I was expecting.  Really wanted that \"burnt\" end taste.

Otherwise, will continue to come back when in the area."}
{"text":"8/4/12

I still love this place!!  I have not had a bad experience.  Had St. Louis ribs, potato salad and green beans. Appetizer of Corn Fritters, great and large portion. Ribs were just a little tough, but edible. Love the sauce choices. One of the better chain BBQ places.  It is a great fall back."}
{"text":"Absolutely great bbq every time! The staff is very friendly. Never left there hungry."}
{"text":"For the past 3 years we have come for my kids birthdays to use their free meals, birthdays are close so we always got two emails with different codes. Tonight we ordered to go like always and they refused to use both codes. I know it's not a huge deal but when it's been honored for the last 3 years it's rather annoying."}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm a huge BBQ fan & this is the best BBQ that I've found in AZ (consistently great). I generally order the St. Louis Ribs, but I've tried just about everything on the menu... the only things that I didn't like aren't on the menu anymore (tri-tip & some citrus glazed ham). Occasionally, I stop by on my way home from work and get a pound of rib tips to go for $8.99. 

For those that haven't been here, Famous Dave's is a sit-down restaurant that's very accommodating for large parties/families. It can get busy, but the service is usually pretty great & they get the food out to you quickly. It's a very rustic place & most of the chairs are wooden. The walls are decorated with funny signs, memorabilia & awards. It's definitely a casual dressed place... the waiters & waitresses wear T-Shits with sayings on them like \"Make sure the fingers you're licking are your own\". The portions are very large for the combo meals & the 4-bone St Louis Ribs with 2 sides plus corn on the cob & cornbread for $12.99 is more than enough to fill me. 

If you're a vegetarian or vegan then this place isn't for you, but all you carnivores out there have found a place to call home."}
{"text":"This is not BBQ, it is slop on a plate!  We had not eaten at this location before, and haven't eaten at Famous Dave's since they first opened at Chandler Fashion Square.  We decided to try them again because we drove by our regular BBQ place and the line was literally out the door.  Famous Dave's always looks busy, so we figured maybe it had changed.  Although the waitress seemed very unhappy to be there and lacked any type of personality, I am not judging them on their waitstaff; food only.  She brought us some sweet potato chips to eat while we waited for our food.  They were actually pretty tasty (although very salty) and were the highlight of the meal.  My husband and I ordered the chopped pork sandwich and my son ordered kids ribs.  My sandwich was lukewarm, if that, and literally just dry, flavorless chunked up meat on a dried out bun.  You pick your BBQ sauce flavor from the selection off of your table.  Again, room temperature BBQ sauce being poured onto a warm sandwich doesn't really help anything.  I ended up taking the top bun off, because it really wasn't all that edible.  I think I may have gotten a side of beans, obviously they were not worth remembering.  I know my son mostly ate his french fries, and pretty much left the ribs un-eaten.  I cannot figure out why people are eating here.  There is nothing that would draw me back to try them again."}
{"text":"I used to love coming to this place, but their food this past couple of visits has been less than great. I have no idea if there is new staff or they are cutting cost buying cheaper meat or what, but you can tell, last night we bought the all american feast for our family and the ribs were just weird tasting, the brisket dry and the wings overcooked. This is the second time we get dry brisket. For the $$$ we spent, I wish it would have been a better dinner."}
{"text":"Great meal and especially great server named Zach. Family enjoyed everything we had (Ribs and Brisket, Pulled Pork and some to-die-for Mac and Cheese). Zach went out of his way to make sure our dinner was enjoyable and brought drink refills without needing to be asked. 

We don't live near this location but will drive the extra miles to support the good service."}
{"text":"We had a group lunch today here and I was quite impressed with their service.  Our party of 13 was quickly seated and our server gal was quick, friendly, and did an outstanding job of taking care of us.  Our food did take a while to come out, but I do believe that is expected when a party of 13 orders and backs up the kitchen.

The atmosphere is a typical BBQ lunch place; lotsa chotchkies on the wall;  I do like that they have a hand washing station stationed right smack in the dining area - I was able to quickly wash before and after my tasty BBQ meal (lotsa sticky fingers); they also are generous with big bottles of about 5 different BBQ sauces on the table as well s giant rolls of brown paper towels (smart!).

I ordered the two types of chikens they had on their lunch menu and for $9 I got a whole lotta chicken.  It was smoked and tasty and my side of broccoli was cooked well (not over steamed).  I am not a big fan of their BBQ sauces because they taste *really* sweet, but a little here and there was enjoyable.

I think it is a great spot for a group lunch - we were seated quickly, served appropriately, had a filling meal, it was a good value, and easy with separate checks."}
{"text":"Our first time visiting here. Service was fast and friendly. We weren't sure what to get at first, so we asked the waiter (who also happened to be the bartender) and he gave us his honest opinion and mentioned he wasn't a fan of one of the items, but let us know a lot of other people enjoyed them. I really appreciated the honesty! My fiancé ordered the Thursday special called \"weigh up\" which consisted of 1lb of rib tips and their potato wedges. I ordered Dave's Sampler platter, which was a little taste of everything. Needless to say, we were not disappointed! We left happy, full and didn't have to break our wallets. We'll be back for a second time, soon... And probably a third."}
{"text":"Consist, good service and food. I love the Georgia Chopped Pork plate. The portions are huge and I always get two meals out of it which is awesome for the money. I know it is childish but I love their jalepeno mac and cheese! I think it is my favorite part! My brother in law says the ribs are always great but I haven't tried them yet. 

Love the variety of sauces. Something for everyone."}
{"text":"I was really amazed by the BBQ here. 

I'm from the South Chicago. Therefore, I know what good BBQ is. Haha... I got to say this place is not bad at all. Sure you may second think it by being a chained restaurant-ish, but looks can sure be deceiving. 

Sadly, this place was very dead, but the service was well awake. For me, BBQ is really hard to describe in words. It's a type of food you just have try for your self. 

Even though most of the items on the menu are sort of pricey, you have to get, I guess the sampler, \"the feast for 2. 

It'll change your mind about overrated BBQ joints."}
{"text":"I have eaten here with my family more than a handful of times.

We are repeat customers mainly for the food.  When we come in a big group, a couple of \"All American Feasts\" usually does the trick.  They have an excellent  menu.  I usually order the Rib Tips or the BBQ Buddies, which is a plate that consists of four different BBQ sliders.  

I don't usually like coleslaw, but theirs is exceptional.  In fact, all of their sides are pretty damn good.  My favorite is the potato salad.

Sometimes, all my younger daughter wants to eat is Mac & Cheese, and thankfully, they have that on the kids menu.  

The different sauces brings your meal full circle.  I love having options like that.  Each one is delicious, but I'm especially drawn to the \"Texas Pit\" and \"Devil's Spit\" sauces.

A couple of years ago, there was a waitress there that we would almost always get, and it was pretty much guaranteed that she would bring us the wrong side dishes.  It was pretty cool, since she would bring us the correct sides and not take back the incorrect order.  I miss those days.

I really like that they have a hand-washing station right in the dining area.  It's only right that an eatery of this style provides such a convenient option.

The only reason I held back on giving this restaurant that one remaining star is because I'm a big fan of sweet tea, and I have noticed that theirs is pretty hit or miss.  If that was more consistent, I'd be inclined to giving them a perfect score."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill. gross chunks of fat in the pulled pork the visit before last. the last time we were there the ribs were tough as jerky and the sausage was gross and had a hair wrapped around it. our server was never around. it sucks because we loved this place at one time."}
{"text":"I have yet to find the perfect barbecue in Arizona. We tried Famous  Dave's thinking that it had a good reputation. A lot of the other reviews are raving about it. I don't get it! When we asked our waiter to tell us about the menu he just merely pointed out each section of the menu not recommending any particular foods, Granted she couldn't of been a day over 18 either and he was just doing as he was told. Our food was decent, our service was decent, the food tasted fine. It could've been hotter for sure (Temperature wise). I did like all the different kinds of barbecue sauce that were at the table and mixing a couple of them together made for a perfect blend. The sides all tasted good. The corn muffin that came with my meal was probably the highlight of it.... That being said next time i crave bbq i might throw a piece of chicken on the grill with sauce and call it a day. If you're ever in San Diego and want good barbecue that will knock your socks off go to Phil's BBQ! It has ruined me for life and no other barbecue compares... Sorry Famous Dave .... I really wanted to like you a lot ..."}
{"text":"Great family ambiance. Our server Rachel was very nice and helpful. Food was fantastic!

Definitely try the Texas Beef Brisket! Omgeee it was orgasmic! Super tender and juicy pieces of meat. 

The ultimate burger was delicious as well. The feast for one combo was huge.. My parents actually shared one and it was more than enough.

Four stars just for the brisket alone lol!"}
{"text":"Came here to eat after finding out therestaurant we wanted to eat at had a two hour wait forthe size of our party... And they had about a ten min wait here. We have tried the location 202 and Dobson and we were pleased with our experience there so I was pretty excited to try this place again.

If you look at my old reviews, I wrote one for the other location.

Anyways... I was blown away by the Texas Beef Brisket from the other location and I readily ordered it for dinner... But boy did I get an almost rude awakening.

I received a huge portion of meat which is good but oh man, the meat was dry :( it made me so sad... The one i had before was so tender that it melted in my mouth and made me sad to finish eating it... But at this location... I didn't even eathalf of it... Sad sad sad

The flavor was good butits really just the meat texture that was unsatisfactory... I wonder if its the location? Do they make their meat differently? Or wasit a fluke that we got dry pieces? My manand my sister both got the same thing from our previousexperience but were also both disappointed... Or was it fluke that we got a mouth watering dish at the other location... The world will never know...

Jk! I wanna go back to the Dobson one and give it another try... It was just too good

On the brightside, service was good. Garlic mashed potatoes are delish the coleslaw was also good. My parents split the Feast for One and it was more than enough!"}
{"text":"This time was a so so experience.  I will be back I will just have to express what I am looking for.  The chopped pork was mostly a piece of fat.  The chicken was a drumstick and thigh.  I asked for white meat for the chicken.  Maybe they do not have chicken breast.  I have to remember the BBQ places are different.  The food is good."}
{"text":"Best BBQ place in AZ. Five different sauces all on the table, yummy chips to try them all, awesome fries, mashed potatoes, and pork bbq sandwiches. Great service, always coupons or specials, sign up for the email list and you get coupons. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The food was good.  I enjoyed their sides and cornbread and thought the ribs were decent but not the best I ever had.  The staff was great and we even got a complimentary bottle of their famous sauce for being a firstime guest.  That was definitely very thoughtful and I would go again for the great service and food."}
{"text":"Family feast at Famous Dave's!  The Feast for 1,  The Feast for 2 and the All American for those with big hearty appetites!  An amazing assortment of BBQ sauce!   Rich & Sassy, Georgia's Mustard, Wiburs Revenge, Sweet and ZEsty, Texas Pit and Devils Spit! A delightful choice of BBQ from sweet to xxx Hot! Great for families.  Quick service!  I had catfish and macaroni.  The fish was sweet and sassy with a hint of hot!   Delicious!  The burgers were HUGE & Juicy!  Almost couldn't hold it in our hand!  The onion strings were great!

{"text":"It was my Father's 65th birthday so we went to Dave's. I asked the hostess to do an obnoxious birthday song. Normally they do not do those things but he said he will make it happen. Long story short, they pulled the whole crew together and made a custom song just because I asked. Great service, and the food was awesome. Thank you for everything, ya'll rock!!!"}
{"text":"Good bbq that is smoked with a nice but mild spice rub.  The ribs are fall off the bone tender.

Service is usually really good.  Unfortunately tonight was not one of the nights for good service.   I ended up having to call the restaurant to ask for me server to please come to the table."}
{"text":"Who cares if this is a chain, its a damn good chain!

Famous Dave's has never failed me when I craved some BBQ. Lots of fun family feasts take place here where we order these large platters that have EVERYTHING on it. Ribs, brisket, pulled pork, ribs, chicken, beans, slaw, corn, cornbread and piles of potato wedges. OMG... I'm about to go into a food coma just thinking about all the food. The portions are generous and fed everyone with leftovers. 

The smoked salmon spread is a must-try. I have to have it every time! Also great drink specials too. I think we had some fruity margs for $4 last time. Great fun, great food and great service too!"}
{"text":"The BBQ Brisket here is what has turned me back around to BBQ. There is a consistently good product served by wonderfully nice servers. Stopped in today for a quick pick up for lunch. The young woman at the \"Ta-Go\" counter was very sweet."}
{"text":"Famous Daves at San Tan is the bomb. Great staff. Friendly thoughtful and always with a great recommendation. Today we were blessed with \"Famous Jill\". She was prompt and sweet. Made the visit tres bien."}
{"text":"On the work lunch rotation for sure. Funny thing. You can name any of the OTHER places on our lunch rotation and if I'm in a MOOD, I might just say bugger off, I ain't going. Call yo momma if you wanna cry about it but I don't care. Mention Famous Dave's and it's like Ali Baba shouting out Open Sesame! All of a sudden my mood changes and I am so THERE! Mind you this is even if I'd just been here earlier in the week. I'm a sucker for BBQ. That ain't no lie. No go dickie die! So I've lost count how many times I've been here. Sure, count my check-ins but I forgot how many times I didn't even BOTHER checking in. So anyway, we always come in big numbers. Well, no less than 5 usually. We know the drill, corporate video trains the servers to make a stupid happy face on the little plate with the sauces for us to dip the potato chips in. One of us usually hides the plate to prevent that from happening. LOL. I usually get the St. Louis Spare Ribs. That's right. Pork ribs. I am male, hear me roar. Arrrrr!!!!!!! Beef ribs are for metrosexuals and grade schoolers. PORK. RIBS. The Jews and Muslims knew what they were doing keeping their folks away from the Devil's meat. PORK. RIBS. The Devil's fingers we call em'. Every bite gets us one step closer to artery clogging hell. But you gotta live sometime, right? So anyways, this is a great place to do it. A religious shrine to pork. If there's any BBQ chain that's doing it right it's Dave's. Right off that street that circles around Chandler Fashion Center - Dave's has its own lot with plenty of parking. As long as the spirit is willing and the pig flesh is tasty I'll be coming back here again and again."}
{"text":"There are not a lot of places to find good bar-b-que in Madison and this is my personal favorite. The Dave burger makes me gain weight just thinking about it and it is worth having to fit in another workout to enjoy it. The place is nothing fancy but something that serves huge slabs of meat should not be. The service is simple but good. If you want a fun atmosphere, great eats that will not empty your wallet I recommend Famous Daves."}
{"text":"You get good BBQ at pretty much any Famous Dave's (corn muffins are especially good), but I'm reviewing this place solely for customer service. The staff here is amazing! Always genuinely friendly and quick. The waiter gave me his honest opinion of favorite dishes instead of trying to up-sell, and they were attentive without being overbearing. We sat near the bar and the bartender came over and helped us out when our waiter was away, talk about above and beyond! Owners/managers, you've got a great crew here!! Be proud!!"}
{"text":"My family and I just ate dinner here. It was my second time (hardly remember my first time was in Vegas) for my family was their first food trip here.
Our appetizers were the Nachos & Onion Strings. And for the main course - We ordered the dinner for two. It had chicken, cole slaw, spare ribs, beans, corn bread, sauce and fries.

The waitress gave us chips to munch on while waiting for our appetizers. It was good!
The apps came 15 mins later (which we got full) because our main course meal came in 40 mins later. Everything was good, but waiting and getting full because of the apps, we could have gotten our food and not waiting on it. It was not that busy.

But the waitress gave me a refill of Dr. Pepper without me asking and she was really helpful coming back to ask how we were doing.

We had dessert, the brownie! It was a big portion, so shareable (if you'd share because my sisters didn't want to share lol). It was ok not that sweet (I like it sweet though)."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!! Such good BBQ and a fun atmosphere to enjoy a yummy meal!! I recently took my family, from out of state, and we got the big platter. It was around $60 and it fed all 5 of us, plus left overs. Delicious!! Everything I've tried there is good.  And they do free meals for teachers on teacher appreciation day!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service every time we visit! We're so impressed with the fact that we have such a great experience each time we go! Bravo!"}
{"text":"Just had the full rack of ribs, Louisiana style. Very tasty. Everything including the service is great here. If you love ribs, you gotta get down here!"}
{"text":"Our Famous Dave's is the BEST!! The food is always perfect. So delicious! and you cannot beat their prices. Especially lunch. For ONLY $8.29, you can order 1 meat, pick a side dish and get a cornmeal muffin. And, for just $9.29, you get a choice of 2 meats (we LOVE the cod and St Louis style Ribs-YUM)!!! Plus, the staff is awesome!! Jason, Sean, Joe, Kimi and everyone! they are ALL terrific!!"}
{"text":"We actually first came here 4 years ago and really enjoyed it, but I didn't have a Yelp
App.  So, does the place still stack up, after a 4-year wait?

Absolutely!

I'll write about what we got today.

The Kraft Mac & Cheese kid's meal with fries and lemonade fit a kid's tastes and was priced reasonably.

The Rib Tips were outstanding and a generous quantity was served. The dry rub was so good I was in serious conflict over whether to dip them in any sauce.  Of course, that's a dilemma too, because all 5 sauces are very good.

The sides were done well: creamy fresh coleslaw with a bit of zing, nice BBQ beans, warm cornbread muffin and BBQ potato chips. Lemonade was icy cold.

Host was very nice and the server efficient.

Nice job!!"}
{"text":"Oh, and, upon trying the leftover ribs (which I swore I would not) I found that their \"regular\" BBQ Sauce was --- OVER THE TOP SALTY --

I mean, STUPID SALTY.  And, kiddies, I LIKE SALT!

I din't notice the sauce at the restaurant because the free chips they give upon seating are also seriously stupid salty, and got me \"velocitized\" to the salt.

I will not be dragged back here again, screaming, if somebody is going to make me eat their tough as leather ribs, or their stupid salty BBQ sauce.

COME ON, Dave?

It ain't difficult to do this stuff right??

I'm a poor boy from Indiana, and I make MUCH BETTER, I mean SERIOUSLY MUCH BETTER sauce AND RIBS than 'yall.

Why does everbody think this place is so awesome?

I guess everbody don't know real BBQ, nor sauce.

Grrrrrrrrrr."}
{"text":"The meat is generally decent, but it doesn't have the smoke flavor of the Chandler Dave's.   I can never smell smoke in the place or outside.   

The people are nice and the place is always clean.  The Saturday all day happy hour is a bonus.    Ribs and brisket are usually tender but the tri-tip is over-cooked."}
{"text":"We went to this Famous Dave's Thursday 5/11/17 around 5:15 p.m. It was nice out so we decided to sit on the patio. Host seated us at a nice table. Tick tock tick tock. We waited at least 10 minutes. No one waited on us. We were the only party on the patio. They must have forgotten about us. WE LEFT! This location is now on my do not return list."}
{"text":"Always a first pick when it comes to BBQ the service is awesome the staff is friendly.  The food is delicious.  We always order the feast for two.  The also have fresh BBQ homemade chips yummy.  We sit in the bar area and the service from famous Evan & Ted was fun, informative and friendly.  Keep up the great work guys definitely receives a high  recommendation from us."}
{"text":"Took advantage of the Veteran's Day deal for a free meal.  Some items were off limits but so what.  I had a half slab of ribs with all the sides.  What a generous deal!!  The drink wasn't included, but I ordered iced tea and it tasted like tea--not watered down weak.  The ribs were great, though I forgot to add sauce.  I ordered the green beans and Wilber? Beans, but you also get cornbread muffins and a small ear of corn!  I needed a take out container of course.  The sides were even tasty.  

We weren't jumping up and down over our server as he didn't refill our drinks until we were leaving, then he asked, and forgot until he looked while walking past.  It's ok, not a biggie to me but I think the tip wasn't as good as it could've been (not my doing).  I felt bad about that.  Maybe he's new to waiting tables -- I do not hold that against him.  

KUDOS to Famous Dave's for recognizing Veterans and including even Vets like me, that served in peacetime.  THANK YOU  for the delicious meal DAVE!!!"}
{"text":"They got it right, it's that simple.

Food was amazing with an ambiance to match.  

To compliment just one of the staff would be unfair, they were all great from entry to exit.

Will be back."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some catfish there isn't a whole lot of options I know off close by home. So I looked on like at the Famous Daves menu it showed the lunch times are from 11-5. It wasn't 4:30 yet I went quickly hit there about 4:25. I waited at the stand to be seated it wasn't busy the lady at the bar made eye contact with me & a few servers walking around none bothered to speak. Just as I was about to go a lady came up to ask if we had been served yet. I replied no and she took us to a table. She wasn't very friendly, I really wanted catfish. I looked immediately for the lunch menu and the menu said lunch 11 to 4 and the price was $1 more than the website . I asked the hostess why there was a discrepancy in the times & price. She immediately went in the defence stating she was new and was told that these were new menus. I said well I came here based of what I saw on line and if that wasn't the case I would go else where. She huffed off to talk to someone who said they would allow me to order the lunch portion for today only with a snotty attitude and I suggested maybe you should update the site to match the menu then maybe people wouldn't be expecting things to be this way when they arrived. I am giving 2 starts for Dan who was my actual server he checked on us regularly he made snake take engaged with my son & he apologized for the error with out making it seem like I was at fault. Not sure who is to blame the company or the individual franchise but I hope the site matches the menus soon. My food was prepared correctly no other issues."}
{"text":"Ribs shouldn't be this good at a chain restaurant, but I keep eating them..."}
{"text":"Everything is awesome here!  I've never had bad service or food!  From the Texas brisket to the ribs to the bread pudding it rocks!  A must try!  And don't forget to wash all the great food down with a sweet tea!"}
{"text":"WOW AND WOW!!!! Go Here!! We called in as we were passing through town on our way to the desert. We've visited some good BBQ places in the past in Tennessee and Alabama but this place is amazing. Service was exceptional. We had 2 of the lunch specials with the rib tips, catfish and Texan Brisket. We also started with a bowl of Chilli to share. The chips were fantastic! The  atmosphere in this place was great. We will now check out where the nearest Dave's is whilst passing through California on our way back to the airport. PLEASE OPEN A DAVES IN THE UK!!! Amazing"}
{"text":"I love love love Famous Daves I took a friend here and when later for lunch everything was perfect"}
{"text":"went to one in MESA....POOR service....server took our order for water and ice tea,,,,we waited for 15 min and she did not come back...so we left...We asked for a quiet place and was seated in a small room filled with a LOUD table of 16....It took 3 persons just to give them their drinks..3 PEOPLE????? If 1 server cannot do it, they should be fired....

It was my MOTHER's Day lunch treat...and I will never go back...it was at 11:30....lots of empty tables...Servers walked around like SLUGS....This Manager should be fired and his whole staff with him/her....

I took care of a 100 person restaurant by myself....so do not say it cannot be done..."}
{"text":"We were very excited to try all the BBQ places when we moved to az, but after 7 years famous Dave's is still our favorite!  I love the atmosphere, the food and the sauces.  They also have really improved on their service the past 2 years.   One of our favorite  places to go!"}
{"text":"Just had the ultimate BBQ burger amazing great service all the staff very friendly"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong w/their BBQ. We always like to visit them when we want BBQ. Plenty items to choose from, different sauces on the table. Always nice, good, fresh place."}
{"text":"I was still a little pissed about the wings and the fish sandwich. I learned my lesson. Good place, good BBQ, good ribs, good sauce. Overall, pret-ay, pret-ay, pret-ay, pretty good."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Famous Daves for at least 12 years, the chain is consistent, the food has always been good, the service may be inconsistent from location to location, but ,out of the 10 or so that I have tried, I have NEVER had a bad plate of food.I am glad they are here in Arizona, as this was one of the few places I ate at  all the time in Minnesota, and I thought coming south would never happen. Thanks for filling my rib fix.....oh and the devil's pit sauce it to die for !"}
{"text":"I very much appreciate a quality BBQ joint on so many levels. Delicious food coupled with a half dozen spectacular sauces makes my mouth water just thinking about it... The sauces are so good, I wanted to pull a kleptomaniac move with all the visible bottles. 
 When the server delivered the food in a timely fashion, I was in seventh heaven. Rarely do I find ribs so tender they literally slide off of the bone yet posses a flavor like someone has not overcooked them. The sides were large enough and delicious that I have no complaints about the food what so ever. 
 My only gripe is the overall atmosphere seemed dark and dank. I hope they jazz it up a little and make this place into the BBQ Mecca that it should be."}
{"text":"We went here with relatives.   I have to say that the food was mediocre at best.   The brisket was not that great as the pulled pork.  Cole Slaw was fine as the muffins.    We ordered the big combo plate for the group as well as  salads.    Our local one in TX is much better.    A disappointment."}
{"text":"It was my first time ever to any Famous Dave's. I like the fun atmosphere and the decoration of the restaurant. We sat there for about good 15 mins before the a waiter acknowledged we were there when he walked pass by a few times to wait on the table right next to us. Brought us drink but forgot the straws said he will be right back with them but never did. The service was very slow. I don't know what happened but 3 of the tables that was there after we did got all their food before we had ours. Finally the manager brought us our food. We had no BBQ sauce on the table and waiter never come back to check on us. I have to admit I'll only come back to this place only for the food and not expecting so much out of the service.

Rib tips was really good and come in a  big portion. Raspberry Martini was yummy."}
{"text":"First time here. Have to say the food was great! Had the Burnt ends as an appetizer and St. Louis ribs. Our server was very knowledgeable as well. Will defiantly return."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out tonight,and it was horrible. Rib tips ended up being more ribs than tips. Food was thrown haphazardly in the box with the sides. Second meal of grilled chicken was passable. Time it took to get food was also unacceptable. Poorly run tonight."}
{"text":"This is always my go to for barbecue. We usually get the feast for two platter. This time we had a buy one get half off, so we got the Founder's platter for 1 person. It's so huge it's enough to feed 2. We had so much left over! In the platter, you get chicken, ribs, brisket, fries, 2 sides, corn on the cob, and a muffin. Delish!"}
{"text":"The service was very, very good, but the food was awful. If you're gonna do BBQ, just drive 15 minutes west to Rudys and get some great grub."}
{"text":"A quality BBQ spot. It is tough for me to give 5 stars (especially since its a wide spread chain) but this has the whole package.

-Great meats, haven't had one that is not good (especially the burnt ends, rib tips, ribs and brisket)

-Great sides (Fries are awesome, cornbread is great, beans and green beans are tasty)

-Yummy BBQ sauces (Devil spit is the best, Georgia mustard is also a must) and a wide variety of them. I buy them in the store as well.

-Decent pricing, especially if you share a feast

Kind of a outdoor picnic feel but don't have to share table with a bunch of other people, it more the traditional waiter type restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is great! Never had a problem with the staff and food quality! They staff always are on their \"A\" game!
Love the Georgia chopped pork!!!"}
{"text":"Famous Dave's is a solid go-to for bbq. If you're looking to find the Oh My God This is The Best BBQ I Have Ever Had restaurant, this isn't it. But it is a delicious, legit, extremely satisfying bbq award winner. You WILL taste the reasons why they are award winning bbq purveyors. I know I have and it was enough to warrant a return visit for more. Just try it, that's all I'm sayin'. It's a clean, well-run establishment, they deserve you."}
{"text":"We dined at Dave's this past Tuesday evening with a group of 8. Brennan was our server and we warned him when we sat down that we were giving this Dave's a last chance since our last Dave's experience at that location was subpar and it took us some time to get over it. Anyway, Brennan was gracious and proceeded to take great care of us with a happy attitude and quick response. There was one kitchen glitch but Tom the manager was quick to remedy this slight mistake and went above and beyond to make us happy.  Long story short - looks like Tom has a great team and we thank both Brennan and Tom for their efforts to making sure our dinner party was fabulous."}
{"text":"I had the St. Louis style ribs (full slab) with corn bread, beans, potato salad, and garlic red mashed potatoes and it was sooooo delicious.  If you like spicy bbq sauce, try the Devils spit!!!


I will be back every 1-2 months to satisfy my barbecue craving!"}
{"text":"I got the full slab of Louisiana Style Ribs and two sides. The food came out in about 7 minutes and they were busy. I hate everything off the plate the people sitting at the table next to me where just looking at me confused because of how fast and how much food i ate. The food was steaming hot and delicious every bite was heaven. I can say this place is fast delicious and very clean. The guy upfront who seats you down seemed a little sleepy and tired but that's the only complaint I have. Loved this place and I can't wait to go back and bring my friends. I wish I could give them a 6 star to be honest!"}
{"text":"We've been here a handful of times but we love it here! We decided to swing in for lunch today and hands down our best experience to date. Our waitress was friendly, informative, and fast! She kept our drinks filled and brought our food out quickly. We will definitely keep coming back to this awesome place!"}
{"text":"So my girlfriend and I went here on Saturday night 2/24 and arrived about 5:25 pm.  It was already unusually busy and we were told it would be around a twenty minute wait.  

It was hard not to notice a fairly large amount of empty tables including patio seating that could've been used had they been properly staffed.  After waiting around 20-25 minutes we were finally seated in a back room of the restaurant.  We waited perhaps ten minutes for a server to bring us something as mundane as water but not only did they not arrive, there wasn't any sign of anyone to even flag down.

A party of six arrived and was seated next to us and about five minutes later a pleasant server appeared for them ready to accommodate their every need.  At this point I began to wonder if we were invisible.  We left shortly after this fiasco but I did inform the hostess that an additional two seats had immediately opened up in the back.  She clearly heard me and seemed to pay no never mind to our dissatisfaction.

To be fair, the establishment was under siege from a multitude of Cubs fans from a recently completed spring training game, however, I'd rather be told it would be a forty-five minute wait than be played for a sucker.  Pity that the Cubs fans they so desire to attract in the short term will be long gone while the local folk will still be remembering their treatment here for years to come."}
{"text":"Yep its a chain. Yep its holding to the Midwest standards I had previously. Sat in the bar after lunch and ate. It was calm, peaceful.  The bartender was on the ball and everything good. The only chicken was good and the dill pickles were the bomb"}
{"text":"One star because 0 isn't an option and our pregnant waitress was nice.  First off we sat in a booth.  My father (170 pounds)  my lady (120 pounds).  Most uncomfortable seating imaginable.  Table pressed into everyone's belly.  Also table was too low in conjunction to seats.  Horribly uncomfortable.  Food came out quick and was clearly sitting around and reheated.  Ribs were tough and chewy.  I felt like a dog gnawing on the meat trying to get it off the bone.  The brisket was fatty.  The French fries were cold hard and sparse.  The corn muffin cold and dry.   All three of us were very disappointed in our choice for a Saturday night meal and sadly looked out the window at cheesecake factory next door wishing we would have not wanted bbq.  And that we should have driven a bit further and gone to Bobby Q.  I am not a complaint person and waitress was very sweet and I mentioned pregnant but I came as close as I ever have to asking to speak to a manager to say how awful everything was.  Famous Dave.... You are now famous for sucking.  I hope offers do not waste their dinner outing here."}
{"text":"Food is decent, not the tastiest, but it's good. Service is decent, can be a bit slow and unsorted if they're busy, but that's most places. I like sharing the assorted platter/picnic with my fiancé because we could have a little of everything. LOVE their corn muffins though."}
{"text":"My husband loves BBQ, & Famous Dave's is his happy place!  The staff are very polite, professional, but yet cool! They make you feel comfortable and are chatty.  The environment is both adult & family friendly, with very spacious seating indoor & out (yes, they have the water mist outside!).  I love the unique decor, with all the silly relics and even the plaid picnic table cover during lunch hours!  The food is amazing, extremely generous with proportions and tasty. I thought it was a great idea to have a slice of Texas toast under the BBQ! The sauces are also great, though I miss \"Brother Jimmy's BBQ\" in NYC, Famous Dave's is close enough!  

Attached are the pictures of our feasts, we've only been there 2x since moving to AZ in 6 weeks!  But as you may see in my pics, is a great variety with big portion for the price.  Plus, when the kitchen sent the wrong brisquet, the manager brought us the right one really fast and let us keep the other one!  The drinks are great, very yummy may I say.  My husband & I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"My family and My moms co-workers had a little party there and my mothers co-workers experience was horrible. Their fountain drinks tasted like dirty water and the food was horrible. I sat with my dad and our service was pretty good however, I ordered the chicken ceasar salad and it tasted like chemicals and it did not taste fresh. I would not recommend anyone to waste their money at this place."}
{"text":"Just went in for lunch with my wife and the food was fantastic!!! The waitress was very friendly and attentive and pointed out the separate lunch menu which we ordered from. The spare ribs and catfish fingers were awesome along with 5 or 6 barbecue sauces that were right on the table to try. My favorite was the Devils Spit!!!!"}
{"text":"A friend of mines talked and talked and talked about this place. So we decided to give it a try. 

We ordered Burnt Ends for appetizers and the Texas Beef Brisket & Country-Roasted chicken entrees. The burnt ends was pretty good, kinds on the small side. Our entrees was ok, was not great!  The biggest disappointment was the fact that our meals came out warm. 

The service, this is the reason for the low rating. Their service was HORRIBLE, completely atrocious!!!!   They ignored us for nearly 13 minutes before greeting us. Took another 10 mins to get our drinks. Our server showed no interest in wanted to serve us, barely spoke, offered zero suggestions. Once we got our food, that was the last we saw of here. The manager was around, but could care less about coming to the tables to ensure the customers was happy. They seemed more interactive with the other customers.

The price was decent. Not too priced on most of their items. 

The atmosphere and cleanliness of the restaurant was decent. The decor was very western Texas!  

The location wasn't that bad, very easy to find. The parking is free. 

Overall, I will NEVER EVER COME BACK TO THIS PLACE AGAIN!  Not even if it was free!  The food could not overcome the pitiful service they provided."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here 3 times and have not been disappointed. First time was a BBQ plate which was fine, but the second and third time was the catfish (it was that good!) I've also had their banana pudding and bread pudding... delicious."}
{"text":"Out for dinner with my boyfriend and had incredible service from our waitress Stacy! She went out of her way to make sure we ENJOYED our dinning experience. A special Thank You to the manger on duty!!"}
{"text":"I would like to start this review by saying that I WAS never a real big fan of sweet BBQ sauce. That is more of a cultural thing though. I was just never exposed to it. That said, I was not too excited when co-workers chose this place for dinner one night. 
Let me say that this place is sooo good I ended up BUYING BBQ sauce to take home with me. They come in different levels of HOT! My favorite is the Devil's Spit which seems to just get hotter the more you eat. 
I have come back here multiple time and I may have possibly tried everything on their menu. I LOVE their ribs... I am a fan of the corn bread and the mashed potatoes are good too. Other things that are good are the brisket and pulled pork. 

I wait-staff is attentive and they were really helpful in explaining each sauce. It gets crowded so don't plan on having a quiet evening if you come here."}
{"text":"Can't beat it!  Great food, great service, huge portions and great ambiance. Love their pickle chips."}
{"text":"Late night dinner with the hubby.  Ordered the 2 person feast and walking out with lunch for two.  This is just a ton of food. It was really good though. Love the choices of barbecue sauce!  Happy hour at 9 with 2-4-6 apps and drinks. Sat in the bar.. awesome service."}
{"text":"My Redneck radar went off when I entered Daves'. They were selling camouflage shirts with US flags on it saying \"Support the Troops.\" There were U.S. Flags everywhere but not in that patriotic sense but sorta in that obnoxious \"We want to remind you we love America more than you\" sense. Our waiter even said \"ya'll\" and sounded like he was from Texas. I was dying for an NRA card just to protect myself. Our waiter even knew we had never dined there before because when we looked accross the room, the entire restaurant was White and very \"Apache Junction\" if you know what I mean.

I had every reason to hate this place and I ended up debating whether I should give this place 5 stars. The food was great. I had the St. Louis pork ribs. It was 12.99 and came with two sides and I was stuffed when I left. I can't believe they had combos that had even more food than that.  Although our waiter was a good ole boy, he was polite, efficient and considerate. He also took his time to explain the menu and didn't give us the idea that he wanted to buzz off right away.  The only bad thing was he was also a bit salesy and tried to push selling their sauces but all the waiters are asked to do that there. Nonetheless, the service was an A+ and very non-Phoenix. Yes, this person was a middle aged person that didn't act like he was going to be a model or actress and act like he was too good for his job.

The food was really good but it was missing something. The waiter bragged that their St Louis ribs were huge and had a lot of meat on them but honestly, they were of average size. I can't imagine how small their spare ribs might have been then because the St. Louis ribs were \"much bigger\" ,  While I enjoyed their sauce, the meat was rather tasteless. No, the meat did not taste bad or anything but there was no flavor like you find at Honey Bears or the famous BBQ places in the country. Their sides were good but nothing special. The Cole Slaw tasted no different than Cole Slaw at KFC, honestly the Cole Slaw at Long John Silvers tastes better than here. The mac n cheese similarly was good but not uniqe. Their french fries were disappointing and tiny little potatoe wedges.  Their cornbread was really good and the only side dish that really set them apart.

I would recommend this place because there are many positives. The food came out quickly. The service was seriously perfect, you never had to worry where your waiter disappeared to because he would come by at least 3 times to make sure you were okay.  The food was extremely priced well. I paid $30 for a feast. $12.99 for a rib dinner is a steal.  Seriously, you can't even go to McDonalds and order that much food for $12.99.  And yes, I even liked the Redneck charm. It's a fun experience and you forget you are near the west coast and instead feel like you are in Texas or Mesa...take your pick. 

Nonetheless, don't expect the BBQ to blow your mind. It's truly very good BBQ and better than El Paso for sure but I would still say Honey Bears is better.  But overall, I think if you go here, you will leave happy and ultimately that's what is important."}
{"text":"Just got done eating here. When lived in Lincoln ne they just were getting going 12 years ago. Like so many other places they grew and the food went down hill. The ribs I got tonight were tough and not very meaty. The wait staff was great or waitress was very helpful and always smiled."}
{"text":"fyi . . .This review is for take-out meals.

We ordered three meals . . . not going to comment on the sides, as everyone liked the sides and they seemed to be fairly normal portions.

Georgia Chopped Pork Platter - very good flavor . . . VERY small portion
Firecracker Green Beans
Pineapple Steaks (which are NOT listed as a side on the 'order on line' feature, so I had to call them, to order.

County-Roasted Chicken Platter (half-chicken) - Good flavor, portion size is a little bigger than half a Cornish game hen.
Mashed Potatoes
Broccoli

St. Louis-Style Ribs (half slab) - these were excellent.  fall off the bone. and had good flavor; however, the description says \"...slathered with sauce and flame-kissed to seal in the flavor and caramelize the sauce for a touch of crispiness\"   . . . they had no sauce on them at all.
Famous Fries
Wilbur Beans

It cost around $47 for three people.

Would I order take out from them again?  Probably not.  Wouldn't mind the price, if the meat portions weren't so skimpy."}
{"text":"Since we didn't know what to expect from this place, we ordered feast for two.  The ribs and chicken turned out to be very yummy.  Brisket..well, it was ok.

*pork ribs = very yummy.  we will order full slab next time for sure!
*atmosphere = very interesting - casual.
*service = very friendly and nice"}
{"text":"I should start by saying I'm not a big fan of BBQ. The bar service was friendly & personable. The beers weren't great. But the food at Famous Dave's is just okay. It's not too bad & it's not too good. The corn fritters say there is heat in them, but there's not. The southern rib basket was pretty good - the meat was tender & we like the pickles & onions that come with it. The beans are okay. The boneless wings were good & we liked that they came w/blue cheese w/o even asking. Really nothing to write home about & probably won't be back unless there isn't another option available or we're really hungry & it smells good when we walk by. That's about it."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's BBQ is fantastico! I had the St. Louis Big Ribs and wowser! I will be full for the next 3 days! Delicious! I tried 3 of 5 sauces available - solid! My date is a Vegan and made the sacrifice out of love for me. She was going go get a salad but there wasn't a good vegetable variety - it was mostly lettuce. She ended up ordering 4 sides and that worked.

Our server was Mike and he was super attentive and fast. This place is clean and has a, \"down-home feel\" that is a most happy vibe!

A solid 5 stars - Happy Independence Day 'Merica!!!"}
{"text":"A couple of nights ago, we attended a Brisket Sampling at the P83 location.  Apparently, someone in the Wheel House is making changes for the better.

On a previous occasion, I had to return my plate of bone dry brisket.  Had the pulled pork instead.

After truly enjoying a slice of mouth watering, perfectly smoked brisket with a sampling of coleslaw and jalapeno mac & cheese,  we learned what's in store from here on out.

The meat:  Grass fed, Nebraska beef.  Doesn't get any better.

The rub:  They did away with the \"house seasoning\", and went with just salt and pepper, ala Franklin's BBQ, of YouTube Fame. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmTzdMHu5KU)
This produced excellent \"bark\" and moist, melt in your mouth, brisket.

The s-l-o-w and low smoke:  Ours was put on the smoker the evening before our tasting, and taken off when it was ready.  

When the tasting concluded, we went to the bar to partake of the happy hour samplings.
Ordered the \"happy hour ribs\".  4 thick smoked STL pork ribs, cost a buck apiece.  They are cooked with just enough tug to give you a good chew.  Those joints that sell fall of the bone ribs, aren't for me.  If I want pulled pork, I'll order it.  Happy Hour end's at 6pm.  Go early.

Chain or not,  this is the best real BBQ in the West Valley for my money.

{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this Famous Dave's location.  I come here often for lunch and I am always greeted with a smile and as though I am a part of the family.  The food is awesome and hasn't let me down once as of yet."}
{"text":"Famously overpriced Daves was our Bday dinner choice. Table shared lotsa apps.. Fries were not crispy enough & Burnt Ends were too dry. Onion straws were good but not really filled w/ onions. 
Got bbq chick dinner salad - $11 was a bit much but was very good tasting, sauce on it was pretty zesty. Corn bread was best I can remember! 
Wife's loaded baked potato was perfect but cheese sauce was too salty.  Many of the prices were hefty for average portions."}
{"text":"I love Famous Daves. I gain atleast 3 pounds after finishing a plate here. Mmmmmm."}
{"text":"This place is hard to find in the San Tan mecca of stores.  I had to call to get directed in.  Servers were nice.  The food portions were very small but tasty.  I wasn't overly impressed with the sauces.  They were decent but i have had better."}
{"text":"Although this store was noisy (it certainly cultivated a family-atmosphere), the food was DELICIOUS and hit the spot after a long day. When we walked into the store at 8:30pm and told our waitress that we were both tired and starving, she promptly took our order and rushed our food. We were greedily gobbling our dinner down within 20 minutes of arriving. Our waitress was extremely attentive to our needs and responded to our requests rapidly. A++ for service."}
{"text":"Louder than necessary. OK so here is a truthful review. Coleslaw 7 out of 10. Mac and Cheese 6 out of 10 Baby Backs and St. Louis  Ribs 4.5 out of 10. I had never been to a Famous Dave's before. I wasn't missing much. Just had higher expectations. Ribs were snappy rather than tender.  Service was EXTREMELY RUSHED...hurry up and leave I have to turn my tables to make money ya know ......Oh well I tried it and was disappointed."}
{"text":"Ok I have given this place 3 try's. And it doesn't matter if you eat in or curbside. It's hit or miss. Guess it just depends on who plates your order. I ordered rib tips  curbside. What I got were doggie treats. So tough they can't be called rib tips. I had complained before because I got a bunch of bones and  manager gave me a 10$ gift card. My meal was more than that. Only went back because on BBQ restaurant around but no more I'm done. And I'm going in today for a refund !"}
{"text":"Come during weekday lunch and the BBQ tastes a lot fresher than dinner. Feast for two can serve 3-4 adequately. Decent kids menu and they have milk as a drink option. You'll find slow service during weekdays. Adequate seating for large groups and they have high chairs and booster seats."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try here for a long time now, went today and had a very relaxing and excellent experience, my server was exceptional, he was very nice, attentive and made sure I was comfortable. I had the feast for one and everything on my platter was hot, fresh and yummy. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure where the hubby was taking me, bbq Is hard   One (well usually) 
I have to admit i wasn't excited about this place! However that changed quickly when the service was off the bat great, the bbq flavors were awesome! And when it came to the dishes I was stoked! 

We tried s few different things I have to say the brisket was my all time
Favorite Holy flavor and awesomeness! 
Kid got the mini corn dogs. I also enjoy a great margarita (better then the last Mexican joint we went to ..... strange huh?) 
Hubbs enjoyed a 20oz beer 

We left full happy and impressed!!"}
{"text":"Wow- what a choice.  We each selected the two meat lunch platter.  Between us we sampled Georgia chopped pork, pork spareribs, and roasted chicken.   The pork spareribs were our favorite.  Five sauces to choose from range from the original to Devil's Spit (hottest) to Georgia Mustard/Vinegar (my favorite)  Interesting items on dinner menu include platters for 2 for $19.95 and a slider platter featuring their various meats.  If you go, be sure to try the Georgia Mustard sauce.  It's a blend of vinegar and mustard and reminded me of my 2-week visit to Raleigh-Durham."}
{"text":"Ate here! There was a waiter who's name was actually Dave, he kept saying he was actually Famous Dave. He had great customer service. He was polite and well taken care of. Anything we ever needed we got, our first batch of brisket was dry, he went and grabbed us some more brisket and didn't charge us any extra. He always kept coming back and asked us if we needed anything, I never had an empty glass. I was really appreciative of this store, I do not regret eating there."}
{"text":"I took my husband to Famous Dave's a couple days ago for a quick dinner since I was in no mood to cook. We always like to sit at the bar instead of a table, mainly because its easy to watch a few sports events and get our order in fast. We quizzed each other on trivia questions from the Trivial Pursuit cards that are sittting on the bar. I took a look at the menu and even though I LOVE their brisket, I was in a ribs mood. I can never eat a half slab, so I got the 4 bone rib meal. Saw they have some new sides, so I decided to try the green beans with potatoes and spicy mac and cheese. My husband ordered the same sides as me and the half slab. Our food came out pretty quick and it was a nice surprise to see they gave me 5 ribs instead of 4 :). The mac and cheese is my absolute fave now. It had pieces of jalapeno in it and gave it a great kick, but not overly spicy. The cheesy mac was creamy and delish. I did like the green beans with red potatoes, though I kinda miss the regular firecracker green beans. Of course, the ribs were so good they fell off the bone. I enjoy the Devil's Spit BBQ sauce, though the ribs were pretty saucy by themselves. 
I always save the cornbread muffin for \"dessert\"...though next time I might try to save room for the always scrumptious Bread Pudding, which is to die for.
We had a nice meal and I was satisfied with my BBQ fix."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of BBQ, and I'm a very forgiving BBQ fan. As long as the meat is cooked right, and you offer me an assortment of sauces, I'm sold. 

Somehow I've lived under a rock, and never visited a Famous Daves before. I know they are a chain, so I had higher than usual expectations for the food being consistent. 

I ordered the Georgia Chopped Pork, and my father had the spare ribs. 
We ordered Baked Beans. Potato Salad, and mac and Cheese for sides and shared. 

The Pork was good. It was a little dry, but I drowned it in multiple sauces, and it tasted good. The potato salad was wonderful, just the right amount of flavor without being over powering. Same with the beans, There were sizable chunks of meat mixed in with the beans and it was De-lish. 

The Mac and Cheese was awful, and that's saying something because I hardly meet anything with cheese I haven't loved. No only was it \"spicy\" with Jalapenos (which I never felt like had a place in Mac and Cheese) but the flavor was missing something. Neither myself, nor my father could place WHAT it was missing, but we left it. 

The service was great, even with our server with a 12 top and 6 top (that we could see) in addition to us. Very friendly, made great recommendations, and kept our drinks topped off. 

I'm sure I will go back, since it's so close to him, but it is a bit generic for BBQ. I think I prefer Lucilles to Daves... and that is also quite close."}
{"text":"Can I just say woooooowwwww!!!!!!!!!!!!! First time at this location and it was beyond fantastic! JAY Was our server and he made the visit so awesome! So much personality, made us laugh and we would come back just to listen to him! My expectations are set for any other server I get going forward! Thank you JAY! The drink and food was perfect but you made the visit a real joy!"}
{"text":"I've been to Joe's & Bobby Q's but Dave's takes the BBQ on this one! We got Dave's family portions for one of our many tailgating experiences. We tried all of there dishes and the beef brisket was delicious as was the pulled pork. And don't forget the cornbread muffins. While this is a place you cannot go often or you will be the pig! Its worth the calories every now and then!!"}
{"text":"Food is okay but the service is always lacking in this place in Chandler.
We went on Friday last week about 6pm and waited for 25-30 minutes to be seated. I looked around and saw many empty tables so wondered why they would even make us wait but the lobby was full of waiting families.

Ordered the mac and cheese as a side to our family feast and did the waitress even mention it was spicy, NO! I have three kids under three and you dont mention that my side dish will burn their mouth and make them cry! I then brought it to her attention and she brought us a side of apples and said sorry about that.

Okay BBQ not AMAZING but okay!"}
{"text":"Well I would give them a 5 for the catfish fingers and Happy Hour prices. I am deeply saddened by their change in music genre. We used to love to come here for the Blues Music  now they are like every other BB-Q place and play country. So disappointed"}
{"text":"I used to be a big fan however  the meat tends to be on the dry side and food overcooked"}
{"text":"I didn't think myself as a BBQ person but this place converted me. We went on lunch during a monday and our wait time for our food was a little long but the good was delicious. I ordered a pulled BBQ chicken sandwich with pepperjack cheese off the lunch menu, delicious and a great price! I like my things spicy so mixing Devil's Spit and Texas Pit definitely gave me the kick I was looking for. Plus the little chips are good too!"}
{"text":"Last time I was here I would give this place a  4. This time a 3 because the service was HORRIBLE. The food was great. We walk in and seat ourselves in the bar area. No one was out front...  We didn't know we were supposed to be seated by someone. Anyways, my husband and I understand that the Giants and cardinals were on (NLCS) last inning yaddayaddayadda but you still have a job to do... We didn't get acknowledged for 10 minutes and it wasn't even busy. So finally, We get greeted and she takes our drink orders then walks away and she does that Every time... Meaning she asks us what we want and starts to walk away mid sentence. No smile, not much concern... Pretty much the \" I don't give a fuck about you coming in two hours before we close\" type of attitude. All in all the food was very good and the manager took care of us after we complained. We will be back but not on a Thursday night at 8pm."}
{"text":"I've only has famous daves once and it was for a friends wedding rehearsal dinner.  They did the family style type menu which was pretty cool.  They bring out a wide variety of their BBQ and sides on aluminum garbage can lids that act as platters.  I don't eat at a lot of BBQ restaurants so I don't have a ton to compare it to but I thought it was delicious.  They also have a variety of sauces to choose from set on the table which was nice.  I like spicey so I was easily able to add some spicey BBQ sauce to my food.  Ohhh and they have an awesome happy hour, great to take advantage of in the winter to slam Great Lakes Christmas Ales for cheap."}
{"text":"Here's a quick summation of the good, the bad, and the ugly:

The good:
- 5 BBQ sauce options - including the Georgia Mustard BBQ sauce.
- Cornbread - for the love of all that is holy there seems to be a fight for the cornbread everytime!
- St. Louis Style Rib - fall off the bone good.

The bad:
- Hot Links are not made fresh, and taste like something that can be bought at the market.
- The side dishes - the hot sides like mac 'n cheese, baked beans, and green beans never seem to come out of the kitchen hot, warn, or slightly above room temperature.
- 5 BBQ sauce options - there seems to be BBQ sauce residue all over the tables, booths, floor, and any other place that a kid would have chosen to wipe their hands instead of a napkin.

The Ugly:
- Brisket:  often times very dry and void of its own flavor.
- Texas toast - I just don't like it in any form, but there's is especially not good.
- Everytime I leave I almost wish that Chi-Chi's would reopen in this location."}
{"text":"came in here for a late lunch. oh my god! brisket and ribs were soooo good! bartender kept my coke glass full,  we were suuuuper happy! loved itt!! btw, bbq beans were soooo yummy"}
{"text":"Staff seated us (family of five) promptly, service was great and food was excellent."}
{"text":"Visited for Veterans Day  11/11/2014
Excellent yearly free meals for Veterans!!  
We waited about 5 minutes to be seated and received fast and friendly services. Considering that day was a busy night we received nothing but great quality meal and services. Our food was very authentic and loaded with flavors. Loved the spare ribs, endless cups of cold ice tea,corn bread, and tried out the chicken wings for the first time they were amazing. 

Looking forward to visiting again"}
{"text":"When I have any sort of BBQ craving, I always head to Famous Dave's. Their beef brisket is tender, juicy and moist and when paired with one of the many different BBQ sauces, it is a match made in meat heaven! The corn muffins are the best I have ever had, with the most amazing glaze on top and the sides are hearty and delicious. I have found that the service can be a bit spotty and this trend seems to carry over throughout the chain because I have also visited the Cedar Point location and had the same service experience there as well. I highly recommend the brisket, scalloped apples, mac and cheese and of course some sweet tea to wash it down!"}
{"text":"Got the Feast for 2. Very good! The hot link was awesome, the St. Louis ribs were also good! I would like to try more of the menu! Service was great, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Worst Service!! 

My name is Juan Quinones, the night of 6/17/17 at approximately 8:00pm I had the worst service provided. My brothers and family decided to take my dad to this restaurant to have a celebration for Fathers Day. The bad service started since we got our table. We asked for a drink menu that was never provided until 1/2 hour later. Some of the drinks (sodas and water) arrived and they were all mixed. The server offered some chips to one of the table (we had 2 tables) and told us that he was going to bring more for the other table, he never did. Finally we had ordered our food and some appetizers. The main dish showed up and appetizers never did until later, the manager apologized and informed us that he was going to take care of a couple desserts. We started eating and we requested extra plates to a different server, he brought 2 plates. We requested more to a different server and no one took care of us. At time We did not see our server for 20minutes. My wife had to walked to the kitchen to asked for plates! It's no over yet, finally our server showed up, we asked for a refilled on our drinks because he never offered, minutes later he brought the drinks mixed up again! Dessert time, we ordered 2 and some extra plates. The desserts showed up and no extra plates again! My mom had to cleaned up a couple plated so we can enjoy and don't get upset because the worst service ever. My brother called the manager and informed him about the bad service and he told us that he is going to talked to the server. When we got our bill we got charged for one dessert, I guess the manager forget what he mentioned earlier. By that time we got tired of dealing with the service and paid for the bill. 

I strongly not recommend this placed!"}
{"text":"Pretty  good food nice good  place to eat for not alot of money would go back again for the food and beer"}
{"text":"Last night, 1st they ran out of tri tip which we both ordered which delayed our food. Kerri(waitress) and John(mng.) both made sure we were happy with our food once we got our replacements choices and then covered our tab. Talk about great customer service."}
{"text":"Went here Saturday night with my hubby, nothing special about this place.  We were looking for a casual sit down place to have a late lunch/dinner.  We remember seeing this places BBQ sauce in stores, so thought they might have some tasty food.  We got there and we had to wait ten minutes to be seated in the bar.  They had some flat screen TVs to watch but the place was super noisy... we could hardly talk to each other even sitting in the same booth.  We both ordered different dishes... I ordered the catfish with some fries and a side of beans.  My husband got the two meat combo, which he got the brisket and something else, they kinda tasted the same though.  
We got our food and it was pretty bland, I guess that's why they have like 5 or 6 different BBQ sauces located on the table for you.  We tasted all of them and wasn't impressed.  The Devil's spit that was supposed to be the hottest one was mild, weird...   My fried catfish had a soggy crust on the outside, but the side of beans were pretty good.  

We probally won't come back, due to no flavor... it didn't work for me..."}
{"text":"Meats dry, French fries were dry... everything was just dry. Although to make up for the incredibly dry foods, their chili is some of the best chili I've ever had! The manager was super nice and friendly.

I really wanted to \"like\" the food here because it's popular, but I can't... I'm too huge of a BBQ fan to give this place 5 stars"}
{"text":"This is a good place... Just had the Cajun chicken sandwich which was excellent but the home run was the bread pudding...this is a MUST have.  I guarantee that you will be thanking me for this recommendation."}
{"text":"Omg first time ever with my family.....yes I said first time ever. We went for lunch and had the best service and awesome server named Tailan. She served us with the homemade bbq chips and introduced us to all the bbq sauces and was very sweet and on top of her job. The food we ordered was bomb and amazing.....the aroma and our taste buds were going CRAZY delicious!! We will be back. Such great service and food.....Thanks Dave & staff!"}
{"text":"This will be my last visit to Famous Dave's. I had the chopped pork and roasted chicken. Again both meats were over cooked and dry. I don't know what's happened to Famous Dave's, they used to have good food."}
{"text":"I eat at this Famous Dave's twice a year as I pass through the Cleveland area.  The ribs are great.  For dessert, you might want to try the sundae with praline sauce.  The sauce is great."}
{"text":"When my boyfriend and I were seated at this location, we waited 20 minutes before we decided to just get up and leave. Nobody got us drinks. Nobody apologized for the wait. We were just ignored and passed over. A couple was seated near us about 10 minutes into our wait and 10 minutes later someone came to serve them. The server walked away and still nobody came to us so we just got up and left. Again no apologies or anything. 
Could have possibly gotten more than just one star if we even got any food but unfortunately this is the only experience I have to base this rating off of. First and definitely last time visiting a Famous Daves. 
Would not recommend."}
{"text":"This was our first experience at famous daves and it was tremendous.  My daughter's basketball team stopped here after a game in north Olmsted and we had a great time.  We had call ahead seating for 40 people at 645 and they promptly seated us at around 630.  They were prepared with three servers and they were on top of their game!!  They did an awesome job serving that many people.  Not one order was wrong and they were all on time.  The beef brisket was moist and flavorful, my wife loved the chicken rice soup and their choice of sides was varied and terrific.  It all ended great when they handed out free appetizer coupons to everyone in attendance on our next visit.  We will be going back, no doubt."}
{"text":"My hubby buys the platter every time we eat here. Anything homemade is obviously going to be better, but this is the closest we can get to it when we're to lazy to cook. The only thing I like really is the corn bread and beans honestly. Ribs are pretty good too I can't lie.  always super fast service too since it's all ready to go!"}
{"text":"Very busy spring training evening. Minimal wait and our server was engaging and friendly. However, our order 'got lost' and we had to complain to get our food. No offer by management to rectify situation. Half of our order obviously sat under a heat lamp and was soggy by the time it was brought to the table. Even when the freshly prepared food arrived it was not very good. It is 'chain restaurant' prepared food, I expected that, but next time I will find a local BBQ'er when I want BBQ. The best part of Famous Daves is the homemade chips (at least that is what they call them) and the BBQ Sauce they serve as an appetizer while waiting for food. Little did I know that I would wait so long."}
{"text":"Loved Famous Dave's! Everything was amazing especially the ribs, brisket, chicken, and sweet corn bread! We will definitely be back. Our server Shawna was great!"}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ in phoenix right now period.  The St Louis ribs are what I usually get and have only been disappointed once out of 15 visits.  Also try their Bread Pudding for dessert it is awsome."}
{"text":"Famous Daves, I got nothin' against you.  Your food is good and I've had pleasant experiences at other locations.  Not that I need to visit this place all the time, but, you know, it's good.  Except this place.  

The particular night we came here was the result of a severe overcrowding at Concert on the Square.  So we gave up and arrived around 6:00PM to a fairly empty restaurant.  Our waitress took our drink orders and I promptly received my beer.  My wife, ordering the common Spotted Cow, was informed nearly 15 minutes later the keg was tapped.  So, she ordered a soda and we ordered our meal, and I ordered soup to get me started.

Fast forward 20 minutes, and my wife has killed her soda.  Our waitress is nowhere to be seen in a still-fairly-empty-for-dinnertime restaurant.  I walk up to the bar to get her a refill.  The bartender tells me he can't refill sodas.  

A few minutes later, a server shows up with my soup.  Literally with another server right behind him with our entrees.  

Now, the food was just about on par with what I've had at other Famous Daves.  But this one left me with a not so great impression.  I give it two stars for the food, but hold back the rest for the service."}
{"text":"Kind of a bummer of a meal taste-wise. The chicken wings were a little cold. The ribs and fries were overly salty. The chicken and the brisket were just okay. And the sides (corn, beans, and slaw were not appetizing at all). Overall it was just below average for me, hence the rating.

The place does have some decent seating for bigger groups and the food comes out fairly quick."}
{"text":"If you want barbecue this is the place to be! 

First time coming here. It smells delicious all the way from outside. They have a patio & bar area. They have tvs. Great place for groups. They have happy hour from 3-6 and 9-close daily. On Tuesday's kids eat free. 

I ordered the wings, 12 come in the wing basket. It taste different then regular buffalo wings. It was good. They give you kettle potato chips while waiting for the food. Definitely is salty and has lots of taste. I also ordered the feast for 2. When it arrived I was surprised how much food was on the platter. The feast for 2 can feed 4 people. It was just me, my brother & sister we could have finished it but we probably couldn't move after lol. The feast for 2 comes with 6 ribs, chicken & brisket, toast & corn bread. It also comes with 4 sides and you can choose your sides. We got 2 sides of fries, broccoli & mac & chs. The mac & chs was spicy I think there was corn & jalapeños in it but it was good. Everything was good on the platter! 

They have lots of barbecue sauces to try as well."}
{"text":"Our waitress Jeni  gave us the draft beer list from memory which had a wide variety of options including all the standards but then some nice microbrews. She then suggested the ultimate burger which was huge and ridiculously good. Lunch specials are excellent. All 5 BBQ sauces are already on the table. This is a kid friendly loud environment with concrete floors. Clean and yummy!  Service and food were excellent"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened...we came here several times and enjoyed our food and experience and then returned a couple more times and didn't really care for the food - even my two year old, who eats anything, wouldn't eat. We have had barbecue beef and pork, buffalo wings, ribs...all of which were just average. My husband enjoys the chicken and rice soup. The Mac and Cheese is a little weird and I can't put my finger on why, but it's off. The service is usually very good - friendly and efficient. Each sever has always taken time to talk to our kids and treats them well - this goes along way with us. We don't live in the area anymore, but would potentially return if the mood was the right."}
{"text":"My family and friends love going to Famous Dave's. I'm not the biggest barbecue fan,  but this place has won over my taste buds forever! 

The Brisket is absolutely delicious. Tender and flavorful.  The ribs,  Wilbur's Beans,  and the absolutely amazing, moist and fluffy cornbread muffins are the best I've ever had.  The touch of sweetness really puts them ahead of the game!

The hosts and servers are always very friendly, prompt, and knowledgeable. This place can get pretty busy, but service never lacks because of it.

Also, you have to sample all their BBQ Sauces. Devils Spit, Sweet and Zesty, Rich and Sassy! You just can't go wrong with any of them. 

You'll leave this place stuffed to the brim and wondering when you'll get to come back for more."}
{"text":"Where else in Madison can I get good old southern American barbecue meat? Famous Dave's is the answer.

I'm a huge fan of the rib tips here. I never fail to get them as they are juicy, mouthwatering, and delicious. If I get anything else, I usually do the half and half combo, where I can try something else for one half of my plate and still get my beloved rib tips. I'm also a fan of having the cornbread and a side dish come free with each order. It never hurts to eat more food at a very affordable price.

The best thing about this Famous Dave's location is their service. I feel like every time I've been here, I've come with a group of 10-15 people and the staff is so quick to put together tables and take our orders."}
{"text":"Just ok today, usually a little bit better. I think the 4th of July holiday rush might have taken them off-guard a bit. Service was a slower today than usual, onion-straw appetizer was very much on the greasy side, and food/drinks took some time to find to navigate the labyrinth from the bar/kitchen to the table.

Food - well that's what you come for, right? Food was spot on as usual. Can't go wrong with Dave's if this is your style of BBQ, they definitely have all kinds of variety to suit every BBQ taste.

Usually a great place to go, just a little off today."}
{"text":"Great sauce can go only so far... 

Madison's Famous Dave's is on par with 4/5 of the 'Famous' franchises that I have visited. Excellent prices, intriguing menu, entertaining atmosphere of shi*hole nostalgia and cheesy Dave photo manipulations. The main difference with this franchise is the lack of a wait.

S. Park Street's Famous franchise is in a lower-midlin stretch of town with little in terms of decent choices (spare me with Edo's diatribes). It has plenty of parking and open tables (yes, I know Madison is far from the BBQ mecca of the world, but ... AYE!?!?!). 

The main draw to Dave's is the sauce. There is not a BBQ experience like it ... the table feature at least five sauces (sadly missing chipotle) including the best ever ... Texas Pit (tangy/peppery drippings from BBQ heaven). Food costs are reasonable and the offerings can be madcap fun (IE. the HIGHLY recommended feasts served on aluminum trash lids). 

All these positives and only four stars ... what gives? It's meat quality! 
Wisconsin Dells location has the best grade of like meat available. Several times I have stopped over to their restaurant only to be floored by the seemingly more tender and less fat saturated ribs and beef brisket. Over here (like the other franchise), I've been less than impressed with fatty and inconsistent meat tenderness. 

Although this location is not perfect, it's still my 2ND favorite BBQ joint that I had the opportunity to slop in."}

{"text":"Being from MA we no longer have a Famous Dave's. My wife google Famous Dave's when we were in Scottsdale for a wedding. Even though we were 30 minutes away, definitely worth the drive. I had the St. Louis ribs & Burnt Ends. My wife the babybacks. I was in heaven eating from my number one favorite barbecue. I strongly recommend you go."}
{"text":"So i'll start off by saying its not the best BBQ in the world, but its definitely one of the better ones.  Especially for a large high volume chain.  

I'll start off by saying I don't like corn bread, but the way they do their's is awesome!!  They have two platters, I usually always get the large even with only two people for a TON of leftovers. It normally serves 4-6.  

Brisket is tender, ribs are fall off the bone, corn is sweet and never dry.  Even the pice of bread under the brisket is something to savor.  We even found ourselves buying their sauces (they have 6 if I recall) and the pickle chips.  Oh those pickle chips..  Buy the BIG jar at costco!!  

Can't say anything about the price as BBQ is always expensive, but this is at the lower end.  If you have BBQ in mind and your not from Texas or Oklahoma, then don't hesitate with this place.  If you are from Texas or OK, tell me what you find here.  

PS, i've been to other Famous Dave's and they are just as good, very consistent."}
{"text":"Since I was headed to Phoenix for Dodgers Spring Training, one of my supervisors recommended me to visit a couple places. One was a casino and the other was a BBQ joint. Right after Game 2 between the Dodgers vs Chicago White Sox at Camelback Ranch, I headed over to Famous Dave's in Peoria.

Well, I didn't know this Famous Dave's was located right across the San Diego Padres' and Seattle Mariners' Peoria Sports Complex. Before you walk in, the parking lot is filled with advertisement from the portable grills, trucks, and the piggish look of the exterior of the building. When I walked in, it was around 3:30 p.m. I was taken to the bar area since the crowd was very light and the game at the Peoria Sports Complex had not finished.

My waitress for the day was the beautiful, Victoria. I didn't tell her that because she had a ring on and I didn't want to get her in trouble. She might get in trouble now since I just posted this review. Sorry Victoria! Well, I was told to try the BBQ Pork, but I saw the Famous Dave's Daily Special, but before I ordered my meal, I saw the Spiked Berry Lemonade ($7.50). Go order one and try it out. Its a MUST!

It was time to order and on Friday's Famous Dave's Special, it was the Sweetwater Catfish Plate ($9.99). It comes with a corn muffin, and two choices of sides. I chose Famous Fries and Dave's Cheesy Mac and Cheese. While I waited, Victoria brought some complimentary Famous Dave's BBQ Chips. Oh my, this was different. It was DELICIOUS! I am not sure if the BBQ chips are house made or brought in, but it was very good. I wish I asked for seconds, but my main entree came on time.

I saw the deep-fried catfish tenders and I was ready to dip it in the sauce. Again, with me being hungry, I neglected the fact that it just came out of the fryer and I just put half of a tender in my mouth. Yeah, it burned! With the help of the Spiked Berry Lemonade, it cooled me down, but I had ran out and asked Victoria to give me a small Bud Light ($2). Glad it was cheap since I came in during Happy Hour. The catfish was delicious and pieces were quite big. Unfortunately, I used so much of the sauce, I didn't notice that there were 4-5 different BBQ sauces next to me.

Since, I did not order any meat, I tried the BBQ sauces and it truly complimented my meal. Whether it was for the catfish tenders, the french fries, and even the corn muffin. I tired the regular to sweet BBQ sauce. Oh yeah, the macaroni cheese! Now, there was something special about the macaroni cheese. Oh, there was some corn in it. I swear corn makes the meal delicious. Like I always mention, the saddest part of the meal is finishing it.

Victoria was great and drew some hearts on my check and receipt. I would have joked more with her, but the ring part was a strong part that I would not dare interfere. She is cool, but her service was great! Oh, I might have to send some Los Angeles Dodgers neon lights since the maintenance staff was putting up some San Diego Padres and Seattle Mariners signs. We'll have to change that next time I visit.

Do you think I write too much? Well, you can call me a Yelp-O-Holic!"}
{"text":"Good BBQ,  nice staff. Love the cornbread muffins. Brisket is my favorite. It is a chain restaurant, so not much more to say. They have always been consistent so that is a good thing."}
{"text":"We were disappointed in the soggy corn on the cob appetizer. The burnt ends weren't so burnt. The  sausage obviously had sat all day in a warmer of some sort, inedible. The beans were a no show with any flavor. Joe's Real BBQ blows this out of the water. Even better Lil' Miss BBQ near the airport. But if you like real BBQ, or even just good BBQ this ain't it. On a scale from 1 to 10, it's a 2."}
{"text":"The three of us ate at Famous Dave's last evening and had a really nice time! 

We stopped in around 5:30 or so and were seated at a booth in the bar area. It was still early, so there was plenty of seating throughout the restaurant. Our server came by a few moments after we were seated and asked about our drink order. Nice. 

If you have never been to a Famous Dave's, it's sort of like a Texas Roadhouse, which is a complement. I've had some really good BBQ over the years in local Roadhouses throughout the US, and clearly this chain has copied the model. 

We started with some onion strings and chicken tenders off the Happy Hour menu along with our drinks. Both were good, but ordinary. What made them good was Dave's sauce. At each table you have five or six choices, as well as the sauce that came from the kitchen. 

For dinner we order a Pulled-Pork sandwich with sides, a large BBQ Huli platter and some Texas steak tips grande nachos. Each was delicious and large enough that we couldn't finish. One observation on portions, they are large -- like two Styrofoam take home boxes large 

For dessert we order some $1.98 mini puddings and brownies. Just the right size for everyone after a large dinner. 

Fellow Yelper Scott D put it best in his 7/23/10 review: \"Famous Dave's consistently delivers no matter which location you go to\". Our party of three heartily agrees! 

The tab came to $69.49, including taxes but without tip. We thought that was fair given the serving size and the tastiness of the food. We will be back! 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"You know, this isn't the BEST bbq I have ever had, but it is consistently good, the prices are reasonable and I have always got good service when I have gone in. 
I have gone a few times for their happy hour, - which is fantastic, but only in the bar. Over the past year I have had their pulled pork, corn bread, coleslaw, potato wedges, wings and chicken tenders. i thought it was time to send a review their way.
I always think of chicken tenders as the safe, or little kid's choice- but I think they are some of the best hand breaded and fresh chicken tenders I've ever had. And I mean, I've tried chicken tenders everywhere!"}
{"text":"I ate at FD a lot when I lived in Oklahoma.  I now go to the one here on occasion.  You really need to make a point about wanting lean brisket or it will be fatty.  It think it is over priced for the amount you get.  The amount is fine but a few bucks less would seem to make sense."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am a little spoiled when it comes to BBQ. Born and raised in Texas and my parents are from Kansas City so good BBQ is what I was raised on. I recently moved to Cleveland for work and get those cravings for good BBQ. I looked up the best BBQ place around town and stumbled upon this place as having the best in town. I ordered the Texas brisket and it was absolutely the farthest thing from Texas brisket I've ever tasted. Terrible isn't even a good word to describe how awful it was. Dry and dry and dry is the best way to describe it. The sausage wasn't terrible, but I was so disappointed at his point I couldn't bring myself to enjoy it. Service was wonderful, but product was lacking especially after being described as the \"best\" BBQ in town."}
{"text":"My husband loves this place. Great BBQ. We come here often & they never fail to produce excellent service, food & drinks!! Happy hour is nice & half off appetizers make you want to stay all night!!"}
{"text":"Great chain BBQ.
I have been several times.
This location is clean and the staff friendly. 
The food came out hot and the drinks were kept full.
I had no complaints.
I feel their prices are not bad for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"The food was fine. The place was less than half full. The service was abysmal. Paying $17 per plate of BBQ should come with attentive, professional staff."}
{"text":"This place is okay. I have been here a few times with the family and ordered the family feast which is nicely portioned but lacks in taste. I came in today for lunch and ordered the one meat combo i picked sausage,  macaroni and cheese and then it came with a cornbread. The sausage is not good at all even with the dip they give you which is like a mild horseradish dip, the macaroni and cheese is more like cream of corn because it literally has corn in it, but their cornbread is always on point.  My husband ordered the brisket meal and he wasn't fond of it either."}
{"text":"Twice a month now, we either eat here, or Famous Dave's comes to us. I mean, a dozen or so Famous Dave's employees warm up their BBQ truck and come to our front door. It's my company's way of saying thanks. And boy, do we appreciate it. 

They assemble their Brisket, Chicken or Pulled Pork sandwiches, with sides of Baked Brisket Beans and a hundred and fifty of us go, wait for it: Hog Wild.  Trust me, there's no leftovers. 

When eating in at the restaurant, we normally sit in the bar area. It makes for a quick get away. But when they come to us, wow the line goes around our office building. 

There are luncheon specials, and if you tell them you are in a rush, the wait staff understands and makes it quick. Btw, I love their Brisket, but their Burgers are reasonably priced at $10.00 and have a nice BBQ taste. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Always reliable BBQ. I had the St. Louis rib and Brisket combo, next time i'll stick with the ribs. Brisket was a let down but the ribs made up for it. Sides are plentiful and delicious. My wife had the georgia pork which was great. 

We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner Monday evening 12/20 apparently right after a busy rush. Our server was Tisha and she was friendly but it seemed like she had some kind of back story excuse for everything. The cooks didn't have chips made, which is usually our favorite part with the different sauces on the table. Whatever, we order dinner and she comes back 5 minutes later to tell us the entire restaurant is out of chicken entirely. So the store is dirty from a rush, they don't have any chips ready, and they're out of chicken. So my husband and I hesitantly order something else, working in the restaurant industry I'm trying to be sympathetic right? Our food then takes forever, and when we finally get it Tisha tells us that was the last plate of the second item we had to order because they were out of the chicken. We eat and our Mac n cheese is cold, and his brisket was dry. There were only 6 other tables in the store and we didn't get our chips until half way through our meal. All that past us, she hands us the bill and I half expected some sort of a discount or something but no. We ordered food we didn't want, got the chips after our meal, with excuses from a server that should know better than to tell us all her problems and make excuses. Never going back after this experience! I recommend you don't either."}
{"text":"If your looking for bomb ribs then you found'em! Been to a lot of rib spots and this is the best for sure! Try the baby back ribs that's my fav! Everything I've tried on the menu has been pretty good so you can't really go wrong by stopping here for dinner!"}
{"text":"So...I don't eat pork, but I do chow down on chicken and beef and that's what I was in the mood for. Hit up Famous D for some saucy chicken and beef. Ordered the Two Meat Combo with Chicken Tenders and the Smoked Sirloin Tri Tip as well as the Dave's Sassy BBQ salad. The salad was actually soild. It came with honey bbq sauce which I asked for on the side. Glad I did because it tasted boo-boo. I'm glad I asked for the ranch because it made the salad so much better. As for the Two Meat Combo, they got the order wrong. They brought out a bunch of pork and chicken tenders. They eventually brought out the tri-tip but there was a scant amount of sauce that came with it. The sauce was actually super good, but it seemed like they were in a rush to get the order out and it came out lacking. The chicken tenders were soft and crispy and the best part of the meal. Service was pretty good and they had flat screens everywhere so you can watch playoff basketball. And last but not least, if you want to watch Gilbert's finest - this is a 5 star place to people watch."}
{"text":"For $120, the hot wings were sweet vs hot, the ribs had no flavor, the soup was gross, the fries lacked seasoning and were bland, dessert was prepackaged by another vendor, food wasnt ready to go when promised, etc. Haven't tried the chili or burger, but I don't expect to be impressed. Mac n cheese was average. What a waste on trying a new place. \"Famous\" Dave's huh? I'd LOVE to actually eat something worth being famous for."}
{"text":"For being a chain restaurant this place really does offer some damn good BBQ. Ribs here are excellent, smoked chicken is tender, baked beans are some of the best I have had, spicy mac and cheese is a must. What I also like about Famous Daves is the variety of sauces you have to choose from. Devils Spit is a must try if you like your sauce spicy! Overall great spot to check out when your not watching your calories and service is always spot on here."}
{"text":"I've discovered the secret of invisibility.....go to this Famous Dave's!

My wife an I went there last night before taking in a movie. We were seated quickly, no waiting for a table and the place was not that busy. We sat looking at the menus, deciding what we would try on this visit. We made our decisions and realized that nobody has even come by to ask for drink order.  We watched as waiters and waitresses came to the other tables. Never a glance in our direction. Another table got seated and a waiter showed up to take their drink order. We realized it had been over fifteen minutes since we were seated without anyone acknowledging us. So we decided to test the boundaries of our new found invisibility.  I brought the menus and silverware back to the person who seated us.  Let them know about our discovery of invisibility.  They didn't care enough to address the issue.  So out the door we went.  

I'm glad Dave is so famous that he can ignore his customers. 

 I hope on your visit the wait staff can see you."}
{"text":"We love coming here for Happy Hour, sitting in the bar chatting with Wes and Virginia!  Great food, great prices (rib tips for $5!) and $2 taps."}
{"text":"I've been going to famous daves for years. I think their food is decent and the price is right. The ribs and chicken leg fall off the bone. The brisket is tender but could have had a better bark. Their cole slaw is creamy and good. Beans have chunks of ham. Home made fries are good. Corn is soggy but good. Corn muffins are pretty good. They have several sauces to choose from but the meat has enough flavor you don't need it. 
The server was very nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"Decent BBQ at a decent price with decent portion sizes.  Probably some of the best in the immediate area.

I went here Friday night with a party of 6.  The place wasn't too crowded and we were seated right away.  We got there at about 8:30ish but didn't get our food until almost 9:30.  I have no idea why they were so slow.

Anyway, I love their sauces.  I also like that they put all 6 or so of them on every table.  I don't like having to ask for more or having to get up to get some like at some other places."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ

I first ate at Dave's when I lived in Nebraska.  When I found they had opened a restaurant in AZ I was there in a heartbeat.  Go with a large group, grab one of the \"feasts\" served on a trashcan lid (don't worry, I'm sure it has been wiped down!), and have a little bit of everything.  Brisket, Ribs, Chicken, Cornbread, Beans, you name it."}
{"text":"I would have given it 0, but the Web site wouldn't let me. Has anyone who has given it more than 1 star ever really eaten BBQ? This is the McDonald's of BBQ. Texture and flavor both questionable... Sysco? The fact they charge as much as they do only makes their pitiful joke that pretends to be real food that much more pathetic."}
{"text":"I went there a few time not back to back, but every time I have been there the food is ok and the service is horrible. The last time I was there they were not even busy and the server had to tables and thus mine was a small group we didn't get the service as the much larger group did. We had to wait 20 minutes for drinks and food.  Then our server was gone for like another 20 minutes we asked another server to get us something and they never came back. Finally our server came back and said sorry I had to use the bathroom is there anything else I can do for you and or get you at this time. I had not had much of my meal and after he told me that I didn't even want my food. The manager came over and ask how was everything and I told him. He did comp out meal and asked us to come back but I don't believe I will due to this is not my first time with bad service."}
{"text":"We come 4 or 5 times a year but also every year on Veterans Day.   Famous Dave's is one of the greatest supporters of the Military and Military vets and treat us outstanding.  We are very grateful to the community who supports Dave's throughout the year in order to provide a free meal to vets for their service."}
{"text":"Loved our food. Good sized portions and value. I got a BBQ baked potato with brisket and house smoked cheddar cheese, butter, sour cream. It was delicious. Perfectly baked potato. Brisket was excellent. Our waitress was friendly and helpful. She made our meal even better!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but I am always disappointed with Famous Dave's, primarily due to the low quality of the meats here.  I have to admit I have given up on them and no longer go here for that reason.  Gristle City!  I like the sauces and the servers are always friendly, but it is not a real BBQ place.  Nice bar maybe, but not a place to eat.  I am a big time barbecue fan and just can't recommend this place under any circumstances."}
{"text":"I've always loved famous Dave's, anywhere i go. The food is delicious, and this particular location the server was amazing. It was a little past lunch time and they still gave me the lunch portion since i wasn't very hungry. I can't complain about my visit"}
{"text":"Whoa whoa!!! Enjoying a night out with the family at Famous Daves!!   Brittany, our waitress was wonderful!!! She was playful with the younger kiddos.   Between the six of us we enjoyed the Feast for Two, a burger  and chicken tenders!   I think the feast alone could have easily fed all of us!   Brittany was a sweetheart to bring out a sundae to celebrate Robert's 12th birthday!   I always enjoy the pulled pork.  Marco and Darry fought over the ribs!  We had a great time!"}
{"text":"Famous Tanisha was a great waitress. We were seated quickly and served our drinks promptly. 

The food was pretty decent, just very salty. I ordered a BBQ chicken salad. Asked for extra tomatoes. Took 3 tries to get it right but hey, maybe I'm just picky. 

Great waitress service and pretty typical of what you'd expect from this type of restaurant."}
{"text":"I had a BBQ craving & Famous Dave's isn't too far so we decided to order take out.  I ordered a smoked chicken breast sandwich & my husband got pulled pork.  The sauce was GREAT but that's about it.  The meat was dry as could be & this was around 6:30pm so I'm not sure why it would be so dry, almost as if it was from lunch, yuck.  We were starving so I choked most of down, drowning it in the sauce.  I'm always on the hunt for good BBQ but this was just bad.  Maybe it was an off night, I'm not sure but for the prices, I'm not sure if we will be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"My family (including the kids!) enjoy this restaurant.  As a vegetarian there isn't much for me but I still enjoy a huge baked potatoe with a variety of different bbq sauces.  lol.  Everyone else sticks with ribs."}
{"text":"We have been going to this restaurant for years and normally love it but last time we ate there everyone ended up getting sick. We ordered one of their \"Famous Feasts\" and it was literally out to our table within 5 minutes. My guess is that it had been sitting around for awhile. I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"This was a tough one for me to write as overall I like Famous Dave's quite a bit but I have had a couple of \"not so good\" experiences as of late, and I thought I should let people know about them.

FIRST - Do not get take out from this location - I cannot comment about other locations but this one is just not good. It seems to me they save the best ribs for those dining in and give the old, dry, cold ones to the take out people.....BOOOOOOO. 

Secondly - the restaurant as a whole just seems to be in decline. We live very close to this location and I drive by it regularly and it just seems to always be very slow around the place. Not sure if it is the poor quality of food they are putting out or what but something should change. 

I absolutely love ribs and their sauces are the best but come on Famous Dave.....get your quality back up and maybe just maybe you will get people back in the door."}
{"text":"I should have written this sooner. We went there again about two or three months ago and the brisket was dry. We didn't finish our meal :( 
I don't know what happened...new cook? short cut on the brisket? Who knows :("}
{"text":"Staff was friendly. There was a small wIt but there was a couple events going on that day, along with it being date night. Restaurant was a little dirty but the gross thing was sliding into my booth and my saddled foot touched something wet. Table was a little sticky. Good took a while to come out. Fill over the mashed potatoes makes me wonder how long the food was sitting in the pass or how far in advance they make their sides. Either way it was just ok."}
{"text":"Dave's is always good!!!   Even better today cause it's free! Thank you again"}
{"text":"I went in tonight, a Friday, and they were super busy. I could tell they were overwhelmed, but not in a bad way. They had it under control. The service was no different than any other time I had been there,  the food didn't take long, and it tasted spectacular. If you're not much of a ribs person, order the salmon! Their Macaroni and Cheese is my favorite from any restaurant."}
{"text":"One of our near by regular placed for BBQ. This particular day they had a tasting for some dishes they wanted customer to critique and it was free! It was so so but the new smoked turkey wrap was pretty good and also the avocado/dill salad. Thanks for the tasting and good customer service."}
{"text":"Went here for a bday party. We had  party of 28 or so....superb service! They sat us out on the patio, the weather was perfect for it. The staff that waited on us were very professional and nice! Fast n super friendly. Thank you for ur hospitality and making Nana's 80th bday relaxing n pleasant!"}
{"text":"All I can say is wow!!!!!!!!! I unfortunately did not have the pleasure in dining in however, I thoroughly enjoyed the food i got to go!!!! I am so going back!!!! I order  the bbq as well as the fish... loved it. I ordered all there sides and it was amazing to say the least. Very excited to try more of the menu!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Famous Dave's. Good ribs, brisket, and burnt ends at a fair price."}
{"text":"Chain place?  Yep.  So?  The food is awesome.  A lot of variety, and the sauces are yummy.  Brisket, ribs, sandwiches....i've had em all and they are all good!"}
{"text":"I've been to Famous Dave's before, but only once at this location. We decided to split the full slab of ribs, which is a great option for two people (or an insanely massive portion for one). The ribs were a little on the well-done side, but had a pleasant char-grilled flavor at the same time. The ribs had plenty of meat and were tasty as-is or with the addition of extra sauce. For sides, we tried the green beans and fries. The fries are a great choice for sampling the sauces, although we also received a complementary bowl of BBQ potato chips when we arrived, which can serve the same purpose. The green beans were good, but a little bit plain, especially in contrast to the other items. I would probably go with the corn next time instead. As a sauce aficionado, I am very pleased that I can have free reign over five huge bottles of BBQ sauce at this restaurant. I like the spicier Devil's Spit best, followed closely by the sweeter Rich & Sassy. We had a friendly waiter who drew the pig mascot in every flavor of sauce as a way to introduce us to the options."}
{"text":"The food here is always awesome! Come in for half off appetizers from 3-6 at the bar & patio. Have the best fried catfish and ribs. Have to try their burgers out! The staff is okay, but the manager is what really keeps this place going. He is super friendly, and goes out of his place to make guests welcome."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????? ???????????????????????????"}
{"text":"The brisket was excellent. I ordered it with mac and cheese and fries which were both very good. Came with a delicious corn muffin. Waitress brought out chips to use to taste the sauces. The others in my party got catfish and chopped pork sandwich which were both great as well.

Edit: after being back a few times, brisket is hit or miss and they changed their fries to soggy and flavorless frozen fries"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick take out dinner while traveling Wings were very good."}
{"text":"Always love Famous Daves. Rib tips appatizer is awesome. & enough for a meal to take home some. Hubby gets the sampler platter. Again appetizer size is enough.  With leftovers. 

It's a real set down & order BBQ joint. Not one of those stand in line try & figure out what you want making the ppl behind you mad places. But a real restaurant."}
{"text":"Our experience here was not great. At first our server was very attentive and extremely energetic. Once our friends arrived and we ordered, our server almost disappeared. Our friend ordered a burger without a bun and the burger was like a hockey puck (although he ordered it medium). We flagged down the server, and then he got a replacement burger (no additional veggies on the side) once the rest of us were finished eating. The manager brought the burger out and told us to let him know if we needed anything else - no apology. And the burger was still on the ticket. Yikes!! My husband and I were splitting so we ordered an extra corn bread muffin and none of us at the table got our corn bread muffins, so after we saw that it was still on our ticket, we asked for them to go. It felt like we were pulling teeth. We paid for the burger, our other meals, the extra corn bread, and got the heck out of dodge."}
{"text":"Stopped by Famous Dave's around Happy Hour yester-evening, and was delighted to see some pretty cool offerings. Draft beers were $2-2.50 and select appetizers were only $4. I got the Catfish Fingers: a basket of tasty, cornmeal-breaded fried catfish. It was a delicious choice; and at half off I think I'll have to come back and get them again. They also have BBQ Pork sliders or side order of fries for $1. Really good deals."}
{"text":"Always a favorite! The best BBQ and the bestest corn bread! Order the family platter you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Service was great and the food was also great.

We had the St. Louis spare ribs, rib tips, beef brisket, and pulled pork which all were delicious."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Famous Dave's. I've had real Texas barbecue and this isn't quite there.  But the outstanding service made good barbecue a great experience.  The burnt ends were fantastic!   Our waitress was excellent!   The manager also visited our table and was very outgoing making us feel special.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"This review is for March 2, 2014, 5 PM.  When I approached the hostess desk, the hostess stood there looking down, doing something.  She didn't acknowledge me for a full minute and finally looked up and asked how many without any other conversation.  She finally asked my name.  I had to ask her about how long the wait would be.  She didn't have much of a personality for a hostess.
When we were seated, it was to a table that desperately needed wiping down.  I had to flag someone down and he quickly came back with a wet cloth.  Our waiter was friendly and helpful.  
The food was not up to par.  Three of us ordered ribs.  One order was dry and hard.  The other two orders were dry, but not hard.  The brisket was also dry.
I am very disappointed with this visit.  There are lots of other BBQ establishments to try and I think we will."}
{"text":"It's decorated really fun! They give you chips and BBQ sauce while you wait for you're food! The portions are massive. Everything tasted great. I felt like I was at a BBQ buffet cause I had so much variety on one plate. The brisket was my favorite!"}
{"text":"I was taken aback by how good I thought this place was.

The server was SUPER nice and friendly.
The food was DEEEEEEEELISH

I *loved* all the different bbq sauces right there on the table.  Seriously, it was my favorite part.  Because I love sauce.  Lots of different kinds of sauces.  All over my tender meats.  Delicious.

The best part... how flippin' cheap it was!  We went during lunch time (which is 7 days a week), and I think my two meat meal with a side item and cornbread was like $7.99?

AWESOME!
I'll return I'm sure."}
{"text":"I recently had the pleasure of using Famous Dave's catering for a memorial in my home. The food was excellent, as always, but the people in the catering department were so helpful since this was all new to me. Their advice for my event was spot on, and the actual gal who delivered our food was extremely professional. She set everything up in a manner that made sense in a very limited space and had us up and running in no time. Thanks to all the employees in the catering department and the Peoria, AZ location who helped make my day much easier."}
{"text":"I have always really liked Famous Dave's. Dave has always been good to me, he knows just how to make a pulled pork sandwich just the way I like it. His ribs are delcious, too. You're not going to find any earth shattering new way to get pork dishes, but man it's delicious. Great cheap, hearty food to make you feel better. The televisions everywhere are probably great for game days, but a little distracting when you're with friends. My buddy Marcus also brought to my attention to the pig motif carried through the entire restaurant with disturbing frequency. Try that with cows in a burger joint and see how that plays out..."}
{"text":"Always enjoy the food here especially the brisket, cornbread and Mac n cheese. Our servers were excellent from the minute we walked into the establishment to the time we headed out."}
{"text":"Great food as always, just wanted to extend a THANK YOU to  our server Famous Chelsey, and the manager, mario for their outstanding service yesterday."}
{"text":"Hmmmm.The service was effecient but I would'nt say very friendly. The food was average, can't say it was the worst I ever had but nothing I would go back for. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich and it was more chunks with hard pieces and fat then shredded pork. I picked at it afraid to bite into weird textures. I expected better and was disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came here for my first time @5pm on Sunday. There was no wait time. We were sitted by the bar. The bartender took our order and he was quick to bring us our beer and take our order. I ordered the fried chicken with Mac and cheese. I also orded 4 of $1 Ribs. Omg....the food was delicious!!. We ran into Steven from our local Applebee's. I'm glad he is here now. He has always been polite to us. They have an amazing happy hour menu. I will be back for sure especially for happy hour! Oh and the manager checked in us a few times which is always appreciated."}
{"text":"This is a great bbq place and the service is always fantastic -- thanks \"Famous Jim!\" I love bbq and I really haven't found any comparable place. The have a great menus and my favorite meat is the brisket, so tender and yummy with their \"sassy\" bbq sauce. Also, they have paper towels and wetwipes at the table which is a big plus. 

I don't live near this location but whenever I'm in the Chandler area I certainlty have this on my list of lunch/dinner places. Just be prepared to want to go to bed after you eat :)"}
{"text":"This barbecue joint is one of my all time favorites. Always good and always excellent service. At this location it was my first time eating in and it lived up to my expectations based on other Dave's I've been to."}
{"text":"All in all the barbecue was pretty solid. Brisket was just a tad dry. Beans were spot on. Hot sausage links where awesome. I love the corn bread as well!!!! Now it's time for a nap.

Service was good, even though youngster picking up plates lost control and spilled all over my bench seat. A few inches to the right and I would of been covered!! The young man was a nice kid and crap happens. No harm no foul!!! Can't act like those annoying customers that ask for coke and get Pepsi and throw a fit and try to get a free meal!!! 

I shall return!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite BBQ joints in AZ! I love me some BBQ but am also all about the sides. If I go to a BBQ place that has terrible sides, no matter how good the meat is, I most likely will not return. The meat and sides both need to be phenomenal for me to be satisfied! Famous Dave's gets it right with both! Ive gotten several meats from here (I go here a lot) and all have been great. These include the Georgia Chopped Pork, the brisket, the country roasted chicken (I think this is actually my favorite), and I definitely cannot forget about the sweet water catfish with remoulade and sweet chili sauce (Comes in second). Ive also tried a number of the sides and they are all awesome: mac and cheese is by far my favorite cause its creamy and has sweet corn and jalapenos in it. So different but some of the best mac I have ever had! Their potato salad also rocks. Its not sweet potato salad but its flavor is out of this world! Also great are the Wilbur beans and the firecracker green beans with bacon! YES BACON!. About the only side I am not fond of is their fries. I find these little steak fries to be mediocre at best. Additionally, most of the meals are served with a corn muffin which is sooooo good. Make sure you ask for honey with this. So yeah, this place makes me pretty happy each time I go here. One of the best things about it is the price. You can get a 2 meat combo with two sides, corn muffin, and corn on the cob for 13.99! That's AWESOME! Now on to a couple of things that could be better. They are not always consistent with their meat. The hub has stated that their Brisket is very inconsistent and sometimes is out of this world and other times a little dry. Same with the chopped pork. Also, sometimes the service is extremely slow and not very friendly. Lastly, the desserts could be better. Being a total bread pudding connoisseur, I order it wherever I go that they have it if I have room. Got it here once and was not impressed. It tasted more like cake and the maple sauce on it just wasn't my thing. If you want great bread pudding, hit up Charlestons. Also, I think Famous Daves uses the same cake in all their non chocolate desserts. Last night when I ordered the mini strawberry shortcake, it looked the same as the bread pudding but with a strawberry sauce instead of the maple sauce. Bread pudding is not cake so it should not be made with cake! Also, strawberry shortcake should have several strawberries in it rather then just a little slice with a thin runny strawberry sauce. But to each his own, this is just my opinion and some people might love their desserts. I will admit that their chocolate brownie sundae is pretty dam tasty. Anyways, if you are looking for great BBQ and sides at a great price, this is your place!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy everything about this place. Love the sauces, the atmosphere, and the food! Personally my favorite is the Hot Link Platter. Its a ton of food and the price is right too! They also have really good lunch menu."}
{"text":"I have to say the best part about our visit here was the service.  The food was good as well, I had the BBQ sandwich with fries and drunkin apples.  It was yummy and extremely filling.  The service though was awesome!  We were visiting from CA and our server was extremely attentive even with the place being packed.  We will definitely go back again on our next visit to AZ.  Our family that lives there goes in at least once a month.  I can understand why.  YUMMY and good service!  What more is there?  :)"}
{"text":"Meh. It was fine. Went here for some BBQ. Has all the standard BBQ items, but nothing really stood out to me. I don't think I'd choose to go back but I wouldn't decline to go if a friend wanted to.

I'll give them credit for their sauces. I like a place with a variety of BBQ sauces. Makes it like a game of \"which sauce goes best with my food.\""}
{"text":"I always enjoy the all American Platter. Sib, chicken, brisket, corn, cornbread and 2 sides! mmmm, Texas Pit BBQ sauce!"}
{"text":"We have been to the Famous Dave's in Mesa, AZ, twice now. The brisket is melt in your mouth, delicious! Our server, Ernesto, provides excellent customer service. Management is also friendly and attentive. We will keep going back and ask for Ernesto, so we keep getting the best experience possible."}
{"text":"Don't ever get the pulled bbq chicken sandwich. Ever. Straight up dead chicken carcass on 2 buns. THE SAME DAY I ordered the bbq pulled chicken sandwich and one bite in I chewed on a piece of bone. I told the waitress and she gave me a new sandwich to take home. I got home excited to eat the sandwich and this time I got 2 bites in and found ANOTHER bone. I took the top bun off to uncover a dead baby chicken carcass on my bun. Literally, there was little over 5 bones in the sandwich. Along with cartilage and slimy chicken skin (that does not belong in a sandwich. EVER.) This place is a sad excuse for bbq. I wish I could take back those bites of food that I ate. Seriously, who the hell makes food like that?! To top it off it was my boyfriends first time and probably last time eating at Famous Daves."}
{"text":"Was taken here to go to the pub across from it (this Dave's is in a busy outdoor mall so there are lots of places to eat right next to each other) but while walking towards the pub I caught the scent of bbq and turned and walked right into here!  And so glad I did!!!!

It's a chain but who cares!  Service was great and we hit it at a good time when it wasn't crowded.  Got a lemonade in a huge mason jar and it was made in house; you could tell by the taste.  No powder mix here!  The names of their sauces are a bit funny such as Devil's Spit but when our server came to explain the sauces I was entertained.  She takes a plate and writes the first letter of each sauce on it explaining what they may tastes like and then gives up a small bowl of the best bbq potato chips I've had in awhile to use to dip the sauces.

Didn't do that, ended up eating the chips as is and just tapping my finger into the sauces and tasting to see how they tasted.  Hubs had a rack of baby back Memphis style ribs that were so good a couple of his bones walked away from his plate (whistles innocently) along with two sides and a cornbread muffin for $24.00.  I had a plate of rib tips which were good but as I remember them being - more fat and gristle than meat sometimes - along with my two sides.  The pickles weren't really my thing but those pickled onions? Yes!

Our bill came up to the mid to upper 40's but I wasn't complaining. My only complaint is that we didn't find this place earlier!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed service was okay waiter was really nice just a little scattered brain well forgotten everything we asked for. The food was nothing special my beef was very fatty my wife's rib tips were really dry. Her cod was very good with great flavor and the baked potatoe was amazing. The Mac and cheese was very bland and NOT cheesy at all. I guess we set our expectations too high and compared it to Bobby Q's. For the price and quality of the food we got I don't think I would go back."}
{"text":"Every Famous Dave's is pretty much the  same, but different. I just needed my fix, because that's how I roll with Famous Dave's ever since we discovered this restaurant in Utah, 10 years ago. 
We ordered a full slab, naked, and two orders of Fire-Cracker green beans. My husband ate the corn muffin.
Right up front, I would say this was some of the most excellently cooked ribs we have ever had at Famous Dave's. Tender, crispy, and flavorful. No trouble getting that meat off the bone!
No WiFi, much to my surprise, but how can you decently eat ribs and read Facebook, anyway?
Even the music is raucous, we love it, and the sound system is sophisticated enough that it does not overwhelm."}
{"text":"The ribs were AMAZING,they were super tender and flavorful. I especially enjoyed the macaroni and cheese which has jalapeños in it...it has just the right kick. The corn muffins are light and buttery and I could eat five but I stuck with one. I also had an Arnold Palmer which was the perfect mix between sweet and tart.  I also appreciated that the manager walks around to see how everything is going. My experience,well my families experience was excellent."}
{"text":"Horrible service. The waitress was rude and unprofessional and did not take our drink order when she first met w our table. The food was mediocre and more on the cold side. Will not be returning or recommending."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite places to visit until tonight. 

I ordered at the to go window at 6 and paid in advance. 45 Minutes later I still don't have my food. Three people that ordered after me got their order.  I brought it up to the cashier and I didn't get a response, just a blank stare.   No apology, no Can do attitude stating they'll take care of it right away.  

I'm very disappointed"}
{"text":"Great experience here for our first time. Server was very accommodating and helpful. Will return when in the area."}
{"text":"Surprisingly impressive and authentic BBQ quality for a major chain. We had been to a few other California locations and became fans of the chopped pork and brisket. Using the BBQ chips to demo the different sauces was particularly memorable (we like the sweet sauce the best). We picked up takeout BBQ last week and we're not disappointed! The pork and brisket were tender and juicy and the ribs were perfect!"}
{"text":"DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE 1 STAR.....So usually we love famous Dave's BUT this location doesn't even deserve 1 star, we had a party of 15 and was told it would be a 45 minute wait to be seated inside or we can be seated immediately if we wanted to sit outside with the water misters on (mind you,  it's may in az and the temp was 105 that day) so we chose to be seated outside thinking it wouldn't be that bad with the misters on,  well we asked 2 differ employees if they can turn them on they both said they would, about 30 minutes later we ask again then was told they don't work!! So I ask the manager why we were told they would be turned on if they didn't work, then he stated he didn't know who told us that but they don't work,  I explained it was hot out and if he could discount the bill a little for the inconvenience since we were spending over $100 to eat in heat. He agreed, well we got a whole $12 off a bill of $210!!!!!!! And we still tipped $30 will not be returning to this location ever again ill stick to the west valley locations because this ones employees obviously needs to be retrained on customer service!!"}
{"text":"Food took almost 2 hours to come out and when we got our food it was cold!
waitress was rude the one by chandler mall is so much better will drive the extra miles to get better service and hot food!"}
{"text":"5 Stars for this Famous Dave's franchise.

Worth the trip for the smokey tasting Brisket and St Louis Ribs 

Both the Chandler & San Village locations brisket tastes likes it steamed ... not smoked!

The St Louis Ribs are always so smokey tasting and tender, even beats Haps ribs on an off day ... and I love Haps BBQ ribs. 

Famous Dave's is one of the better franchise's in the USA, very consistent and always a great experience. I always eat in the bar because thats how I roll, I  have never been disappointed at any location. However this particular Dave's deserves and extra star for doing a better job smoking the meats. While I live closer to San Tan, I usually drive the extra distance to get my fix here

Only downside to Dave's is the corporate selection of beer, local microbrew's would have be visiting more often."}
{"text":"Good Food, bad service by Carsten. I guess if you are not a party group, you get no service= bad tip."}
{"text":"Famous Daves satisfies that question when you have NO IDEA what you want for dinner.  Just remember that.

I'm sorry... I love the barbecue but I go there for two things... the sweetwater catfish ... and the BREAD PUDDING.  ENOUGH SAID!!!

The only bad thing is parking.  If you can't get their early... make sure you wore comfortable shoes.  Other than that... CAN'T BE A HELPIN' OF DAVE's"}
{"text":"We took the kids out the other nite, just to try someting new. We went here since other places were packed. This place was busy but we were able to get in. Well we made a great choice. 

Kids loved their dinner, and they have a great kdis menu too."}
{"text":"I went with my sister 2 days ago. It was my first time eating Famous Dave's. I got a hamburger and got some mac & cheese. They were both okay, I tasted better. Now the hot wings & onion rings were better. the place was packed we sat outside."}
{"text":"I experienced Famous Daves BBQ late one after work. A co-worker and I stopped by during the last half hour and he promised the food was amazing: he wasn't kinding!

We had a sampler with BBQ sandwiches, but before we got our food the waitress gave a little tutorial on all their famous sauces in a cool little presentation (that we got to taste of course). My favorite sauce: rich and sassy! The best part about Famous Daves is that you can buy the sauces to take home. And, be sure to check out your WalMart because they might even have the famous sauce for sale. :) 

All around Famous Daves is great! And its a national chain, so you can find them all over the country."}
{"text":"A local coworker bud of mine swears by this place so when in town on business we usually stop by...the BBQ here is pretty tasty. I have yet to be disappointed but I always get the same thing...BBQ ribs with Potato Wedges and Corn. If you like spicy...you will love their Devils Spit BBQ Sauce. Just right amount of heat...not sure how other Famous Dave chains are in comparison but I am a fan when in Peoria."}
{"text":"Really good food but don't come at night, say 8p. Service was terrible, our waitress forgot to put our order in and was more concerned with the people (friends) at the bar than her other customers. Management was no help at all didn't comp anything and for $52 dollars for two, not worth the time. Maybe take out or got early."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today with my wife and kids. Hostess was somewhat nice she seemed like she did not want to be there. We waited for 12 min for a server to come and great us while other guest got service right away. Even beign there for 2 min. Once our server approached the table he seemed upset and looked like he hated his life. I can not recall his name but all I know he was an African-American male. Didnt bother to let us know about their lunch specials or even recommend any dishes. At that point I just wanted to leave but my kids were hungry. Food was great and to who ever ran our food and got us refills was an amazing server (not our server) he treated HIS tables with much respect and made them feel welcomed. As a General Manager to a local chain, I hate doing this review but Daves needs to know how their staff treats their guest. You have delicious food but service needs to improve. I will eat here again just wont be anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Just sat here for 30 minutes. No one even offered us a glass of water. Left after being told 3 times our waiter would be right with us. Yet mooned offered any help. Will not be coming back anytime soon  waiters and host were busy talking up at the front entrance of the entire time."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's changed the Rib Tips. In my opinion the Rib Tips are no where near as tasty as they were before the change. That's why I am knocking down FD from 5 to 3 stars.

The outer edges of the ribs are cooked too well done which dries out the ribs and makes them stringy and hard to chew plus they put so much fuego on the ribs. If I wanted hot & spicy ribs, I would have spiced it up with one of their BBQ Sauces on the table. I'm guessing Devil's Spit would probably have spiced it up for people who like it hot. The fries and all of the other sides are fabulous as usual.

My sons enjoyed the pork sammiches. So there is some decent food but I don't see myself returning to Famous Dave's after about a 15 year run eating at Famous Dave's around the country."}
{"text":"5 stars for service- after a disappointing experience at a resturaunt nearby that would not accommodate our large party Famous Dave's was more than willing to take us. Our group of nine couples was seated promptly in a comfortable spot and received service with a smile. The food is typical to the chain hence the 4 stars in my review, but we will return because of the pleasant overall experience!!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! The place had 25 tables open and said they were busy and made us wait."}
{"text":"I took advantage of the lunch/early-bird special and ordered the 2 meat platter with ribs & brisket.  They were both tender and delicious.  The brisket has a rich smoky flavor and the ribs had the perfect crust on the outside and juicy meat on the inside.

This is a family restaurant with lots of children and always busy, so be ready.  There was no wait when we came in, but it was about 4 pm.

Big steak fries, coleslaw, corn on the cob and corn biscuit are all good side selections. Oh, and beers are only $2.50 at this time of the day!
Overall the prices are very affordable and the portions are good sized.

Happy BBQ!"}
{"text":"We usually come here welcomed and service is excellent but today we are not happy with our customer service. My daughter and I are both not satisfied. Both unhappy. They are taking forever coming back to us for everything. I'm so upset. And not to mention it's my daughters birthday. Maybe we'll give it another shot here but now I'm looking into a different BBQ joint."}
{"text":"We were in the area and craving BBQ, so we decided to give Famous Daves a try. The hostess staff was friendly and we were seated quickly in the bar area. The bartender came over away to take our order and was very nice throughout the visit. 

Looking around, I was astounded by the size of the plates--no, platters--that were on the tables in front of those around us.  This place definitely is not stingy with their food.  We both ordered the 2-meat lunch specials. My wife got the chicken and ribs with sweet corn, I got the chopped pork and beef brisket with fries.  Both plates also came with corn bread.  We also got complimentary kettle chips (mesquite bbq flavored, of course) the way italian restaurants serve bread. They were quite good!

Our food came out shortly thereafter, and we split everything as usual.  Overall, I liked her chicken (a little on the small side) and ribs (delicious!) better than my pork (which was really good) and brisket (which was a bit dry for my tastes).  As I mentioned before, they are quite generous with their portions, and we had leftovers to take home. 

We will definitely be back, and next time I hope to save room for one of their desserts!"}
{"text":"Its a chain BBQ place but if you're in town visiting you probably haven't heard of it. The wait staff is excellent, helpful and friendly. they even explain the different sauces. They have regular specials and even happy hour specials. The food is good, i haven't really had a bad thing on their menu. Its not your Texas bbq served on butcher paper but its good for AZ standards. I'd recommend the place for family or friends visiting the valley looking for a nice family restaurant, they have salads, wings, fish, chicken, ribs, brisket and a full bar. Im not sure i'd take someone who doesn't eat meat here. Go check it out i doubt you'll be disappointed. They even cater large parties and its ok to bring the kids to this place family friendly!!  Also sign up for the email club you get coupons, specials and a free meal on your birthday"}
{"text":"DO NOT LET THE FACT THAT THIS IS PART OF A CHAIN CONFUSE YOU! This is the FINEST BBQ you will ever have. Several kinds of BBQ sauce, you will find what you like here. The pork is tender, juicy and well flavored. There is actually a crust on it from the rub! The tri tip, beyond yummy! THE CORNBREAD IS DONE RIGHT!!! Soft, not too sweet, but moist and wonderful with butter or slapping a piece of meat on top and slathering with sauce. YES I SAID SLATHERING! Mac and cheese is great. 2 things they don't mention about it, it has corn (Love it) and jalapenos (not so much of a fan, but it's not inedible). Drunken Apples rock, beans with chunks of bacon rock, the corn is respectable (I grew up in a town that had a fair every year at harvest time, I know corn people). Drinks, pear martini -  a bit bitter, not a fan, LOVE LOVE LOVE the Sweet mama though. Well done, not bitter and goes down a little too smooth (Either sip slowly for a long time with a lot of food or have a DD, this is a BIG drink).

My bottom line, the best BBQ I've ever had, and I've had a lot in my life. Start to finish, the only complaint was the martini. Hubby and I ate, I had 2 drinks, he had 1 beer. I had pork, apples, mac and cheese and cornbread. He had chicken and tri tip, baked beans, french fries, and cornbread... $53!!! OMG!"}
{"text":"On our way to a company event, we decided to stop off for lunch. There were eight of us. Place was basically empty. So we were seated right away. Ordered a bunch of appetizers. The nachos were great. I ordered the burnt ends, and ribs with a cup of chili. Yes, way to much. I only ate about half of the plate. Meal was very good. Ribs were worth it, better then the burnt ends. Chili was great. Waitress kept our drinks full, came by a lot to make sure everything was fine. Well worth the stop, hopefully be able to come by again."}
{"text":"Went to Famous Dave's with about 30 folks yesterday. We had one long table so of the 30, one was only near about 5 other people. That's OK, not much you can do unless you have a round table that seats 30. Anyway, the place is nice, lots of franchise stuff on the walls. It is clean and there are no lingering odors..that's a plus. The servers were attentive, took drink orders and then got right back for menu selections. A group of 30 can create problems but surprising enough once food started to come from the kitchen there was a steady stream and everyone was eating at roughly the same time. Most folks had some form of sandwich  consisting of a bbq meat on a bun or roll. The tables had a variety of sauces from hot to mild. Most sandwiches had a side dish and some kind of fries or onions. I had bbq nachos which was clips, lettuce, shredded chicken and the usual nacho stuff. It was OK, nothing special for a seasoned nacho eater such as me. Most folks liked their bbq dishes, a few said the meat was dry, but I guess that is what all the sauces are for. As a dining experience Famous Dave's is a good place for a group and families. The food is typical bbq fare, venue is nice, service is above average creeping into the exceptional level."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try Famous Dave's. Place just opened, picked any seat I wanted. Served my drink really fast. And took my order. Now for some weird reason, I have been on a ribs fest? When I was younger I loved them, and for some reason I stopped eating ribs for the longest time? But since we moved to the Valley, It's been on! Famous Dave's has three different style ribs. Their famous St Louis ribs, Chicago Style, and Memphis Style. Wasn't sure which one I wanted to try. So I ended up getting a half of slab of the St. Louis and Memphis. 
St Louis Ribs were great, I will continue to come back just for these ribs! No wonder why they are their award winning ribs. 
Memphis Style ribs were OK, not my cup of tea. I have had better, but this wasn't real bad.
Next time I will try their Chicago Style. Ribs come with a selected side dishes. I had their beans and fries. Over all I had a very positive experience, service was very good, and the food were very good."}
{"text":"Food is great! Service not so great. I had gone to FD with my parents. They have never been there. and it took really long for us to get our food. We didn't even get chips. That is not such a big deal but when you see other people that have gotten there after us getting their chips and food it is very disrespectful. When it came time to pay we all split the bill. My parents paid cash and I paid with card. The waiter ran my card first and took all the money from my card. I am a stay at home mom, it was quite a bit of money because we came in a large group, and I can't afford that right now. So that happened but the waiter completely lied to me. He said it was the process because their computers are so old, he also mentioned I will get my money the next day I got it almost a week later. I have handled a cash register before. I know that you take the cash first then the card. I am not someone who likes scandals so I left quietly and called, the next day, corporate office to see when I would get my money because I haven't received it. I mentioned the whole situation. They did nothing to fix it."}
{"text":"While polite and kind the servers and staff are exceptionally slow and lethargic. Every time we have dined something is always forgotten and there is never any sense of urgency to rectify the situation. Tonight we were served our salads with no dressing and after 7 mins. it was finally brought over. 

With saying that the food is very good, everything we have ordered seems to be fresh and comes out very hot. The lunch specials and happy hour are great and quite large. It's nice that the table has all of their BBQ Sauces on the table to try too."}
{"text":"This place is great for large groups. I love that they serve pickles while you wait!  If your a large person I suggest you ask for table because the booths are very squished making the bellies hit the tables. 
Brisket is amazing very tender and mouth watering.
I love all the different selections of the BBQ sauce you get to choose from. 
The waiters are all very friendly.  This is a very busy place and the noise level can't get very loud.
If bringing a child call ahead and ask for a table in the corner or out of high traffic. There is not a lot of walk way so I had my baby in the car seat, I think I held the highchair the whole time in fear of being knocked over. At one point had to move the high chair so a wheel chair customer could get through.  Now that we know this we will call ahead for a special requested table.  
Food is amazing and we will be back for some more! Portions are very generous and well flavored also."}
{"text":"I've eaten lunch there a couple times, foods not bad ribs are good and sausage links and the brisket is a little dry but over all not bad."}
{"text":"Yummy food, good pours.. And 5 months later the bartender still remembers what we drink.. How great is that!?! The food and service keeps us coming back! Pass the napkins!!!"}
{"text":"Came in for the first time due to yelp. I had high expectations and they blew me away. Service was great, food was served fast! Everything tasted great! Cannot say one bad thing about my first visit. If its your first time let them now!"}
{"text":"Pricier than Honey Bear's BBQ, Tom's BBQ, or Andrew BBQ, but the beef brisket is better trimmed of fat than at Toms or Andrews (so once you throw the fat away you probably are paying the same price). We buy BBQ brisket \"to-go\" so that we can make our own sandwiches at home. The beef is tender and slightly smokey.
I have eaten in the restaurant a couple of times and service was great. The corn muffins and chicken are excellent. The sides are average. I like their sauces (not too sweet nor overpowering).
This Famous Dave's BBQ is located at the Riverview shopping center at the 202 and Dobson. Easy parking and parking right next to the door for \"to go\" orders."}
{"text":"My friend and I had a lunchtime craving for some brisket. We both had the one meat platter and chose the Texas brisket. I had the side of garlic mashed potatoes and my friend had the potato salad. The cornbread muffin that accompanied the platter was moist and tasty. The one meat platter was $8.97. The meat was tender and needed very little bbq sauce (you have your choice of 5 different types of sauces). I especially liked the red skinned mashed potatoes. Real bits of mild garlic gave them a pleasing punch.

Our server was super nice. The place looked clean. There are both table and chairs and booths for seating. We got a sandwich to-go for my friend's husband and it arrived freshly prepared as we payed the bill. Parking is close to the door.

Yeh, it is a chain, but Famous Dave's does it well. The bonus is that it is a sit down place. For my mobility impaired friend this is the way to go over cafeteria style serving lines found in many bbq restaurants."}
{"text":"I don't like BBQ sause, but this place is the bomb! The food is fast and high quality! Parking sucks, but thats what happens when they are this good I guess! I will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"its been 1 year since I had FAMOUS DAVE'S but after going this past Friday(10/3/14) , its been way too long. the food was extremely excellent, as well as the prompt and courteous service. FAMOUS DAVE'S have brought the notch up by a few 1,000,000 points. THANK YOU FOR COMMING TO ARIZONA!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't really understand what the big deal is with this place. It's not as great as everyone makes it seem. I'm just not a fan. The food isn't as flavorful as BBQ should be. I don't know if it's just because I have high expectations because I've had some amazing BBQ from back east...or what the deal is. This place just doesn't do it for me. And I've even given it about 3 chances and each time I wasn't impressed. Sorry Dave :( :("}
{"text":"We have eaten at Famous Dave's for years in many different locations. The food is usually very good. However, in the last few months, the fries have been awful! Please bring back the originals. The meats are wonderful!"}
{"text":"I went for a work lunch, and while the food was delicious, as always, the service was fairly poor.  I ordered a two meat lunch platter with chopped pork and barbecue chicken.  When my meal was served, it was chopped pork and roasted chicken.  I mentioned it to the server and she said that it was barbecue chicken and that she would put some more sauce on it.  Not what I wanted as the barbecue chicken is chopped and the roasted chicken is served on the bone.  She brought my same plate back with barbecue sauce all over the chicken.  A few minutes later, she approached the table and said that the server who took the order put it in the computer wrong and then walked away.  She made no attempts to make my order correct or offer to bring the correct meal out.  I am extremely disappointed in this level of service."}
{"text":"Called in my order and when I arrived it was ready and tasted great, first time I've eaten there only because I had a gift card but will go back for sure."}
{"text":"For our birthdays, my parents treated me and my husband out to Famous Dave's. Our waitress, Brenda, was really good and friendly and I could have sworn she'd been a waiter for a long time but she told us that it was her first week. Nevertheless, she knew the entire menu and answered my mom's questions about the garbage can platter. 

Let me say that the ribs are seriously meaty!!! About an inch thick from the bone. I love all the choices in the barbeque sauces. Their coleslaw is super creamy (I don't think it has onions in it, hey, not everyone can eat onions). The pork and beans were warm and not from a can. Afterwards, they brought out ice cream for us on account of our birthdays and the cool part is they bring it out with a sparkling Roman candle on the plate; it's quite a sight. 

Only dinged them one star for a few MINOR reasons. The platter is just too much meat. It's almost nothing BUT meat. It'd be great if they mixed it up and replaced those huge chicken breasts with more of those carrot sticks (we only got two for four people), and maybe with onion rings or mustard potato salad. The corn muffins are NOT good at all. They taste like cardboard. 

On a quick note, the little drawing that the waitress is forced to draw on the plate is useless. It's trivial and the plate just takes up more room on an already cramped table."}
{"text":"Good BBQ in dusty, dry, hot Arizona..."}
{"text":"We came here on a Wednesday night , group of 9. We were seated right away. Our lovely server Abby was very helpful . Our food came our really fast . On top of that , the manager Cheryl  came over and visited our table and chatted up my visiting family members . She found out it was my birthday and brought out a desert for the table and also a take home one. Totally not expected . Staff was courteous . The guest service that was provided was phenomenal . Thank you"}
{"text":"It was decent/good food, bbq pork sandwich was a little dry but the sides, mac and cheese and potatoes salad, were very good. The service was a little slow but all in all a little better then normal. I know what I'm getting when I come here, so will be back when in the mood and it's on the way to where I'm headed, would not drive out of the way for the place."}
{"text":"Ask for Wilburs revenge for a.spicer bbq sauce!"}
{"text":"It had been a while since we have had lunch or dinner here, sooooo good! We order a feast to try everything and we have leftovers for tomorrow. The brisket was tender and delicious. The ribs are awesome with a little sweet and zesty BBQ sauce! The Mac n cheese was very good, no complaints!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here for a few years but little has changed. The food is still good and for lunch it's a quick and easy place to eat. I got the BBQ chicken sandwich this time and it was very good as was the side of fries. The service is almost too attentive. I don't need to be asked three times how things are. Once is enough after I have eaten a few bites. Our waiter seemed new and talked so fast I couldn't understand him but thats the only minor complaint. I have always liked Dave's and still do. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"Always Good

I have visited famous Daves a few times and I've never been disappointed. The food is always good, service is always great, and the restaurant  is always clean.

On this visit we shared one of the Combo Platters that were designed for 2-3 people and fed 3 with enough for a take home box that served one more.  The Combo Platter had a nice variety of smoked chicken, ribs, brisket, corn on the cob, baked beans, fries, cold slaw, and corn bread muffins. 

Famous Dave is a little bit on what some might consider the expensive side, but it was a good price for what you get."}
{"text":"Their customer service was excellent but the baby back ribs were horrible. I still think bobby q's has the best fall off the bone ribs."}
{"text":"Sorry folks, but if you think Famous Dave's is great BBQ then you need to get to a real down home open pit place sometime. Few BBQ places in the Midwest serve up the real deal BBQ, but there are some around, just not in Madison. Head to Speed Queen or Isiaah's in Milwaukee for truly excellent BBQ. Other than that head down South. Whatever you do, don't confuse Famous Dave's with the real thing. It ain't."}
{"text":"It was ok. I liked the atmosphere and the service was good but nothing else really impressed me. I split the BBQ Feast with my family which contained a little bit of everything. I will say this, the beans and the corn bread were really good."}
{"text":"So my feelings regarding Famous Daves leaves me a bit torn. Having lived in Kentucky and Tennessee for a while, I grew accustomed to REAL barbeque. From what I've seen, real BBQ doesn't exist this far north. If you can keep that thought in the back of your mind, Famous Daves is fantastic. Sure, it isn't cooked by Bubba with the genius of a multi-generational savant but it is still solid, mouth watering Que. 

Their corn bread muffins pretty much do the trick for me every time I go. Even if the rest of the meal is mediocre, I would return for those babies any time!

So, unless you are willing to trek 8 hours to visit Heavy's BBQ in the sticks of rural Tennessee, this is probably as good as you're going to get in CLE."}
{"text":"Well, they're consistent.  Over a year since my last review, and not much has changed.  The BBQ is still fine (not great, but good).  The complimentary bowl of chips are generally good (sometimes a bit salty, but they make these fresh so that varies from one batch to the next...OK so that isn't consistent!).  Service is still good.

Brisket and ribs are probably their best things, which is what I had.  Add some sauce and they're tasty (actually, the ribs already have sauce, but the brisket needs it).  Corn bread is good.  Fries are good.  As it has been in my past reviews, so it is now.

We also got a dessert this time.  While I love chocolate I just can't deal with their chocolate brownie.  It is more walnuts than brownie. I don't like that.  A few nuts are OK, but it is astounding how many nuts they cram into a brownie.  Way too much for me.  I wish they had a no-nut option.  My wife likes the bread pudding, so that's what we got."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I reviewed this place.  So I should update.

I only come here when they have a special.  Free meal for veterans, coupon, etc.  Otherwise there's another place I prefer.

That said, the BBQ here is pretty good.  Not great, but pretty good.  They seem to do a good job with brisket and ribs.  Their chicken is nothing special, and I don't like the chopped pork.  The sausage is OK...ordinary, but OK.  The beans are pretty good, the corn is usually a bit mushy, and the fries are plain but good.  I also like the corn muffins.

We sat in the bar, so our server was the bartender.  Service was adequate.  He checked on us enough.

Overall a respectable BBQ place."}
{"text":"I have always been a huge fan of Famous Dave's but over the past couple years or so the quality seems to have declined significantly. 

I always get naked St Louis ribs. They used to always be fresh, we'll seasoned with the rub, tender, and perfectly cooked. The last few times they have been burnt, chewy, dry, underseasoned and just not up to par with what I've always gotten & loved at Dave's. The only problem I used to have was EVERY SINGLE TIME if I ordered a side of ranch for my fries, it wouldn't come out w the meal and it would take a long time for someone to ask if everything was OK so I could request it again. But... That was minor and even became kind of a joke to me bc I just knew to expect it every time. 

Last night we got take out from there for the first time. We usually dine in but my boyfriend picked it up & brought it over. I ordered my usual naked ribs and decided to go with sides of corn & broccoli. I felt like some nice fresh veggies would be good for me. The broccoli was completely inedible. It was dry and about 90% brown and wilty. I can't even believe they would send something like that out to a customer. If I didnt live so far away I certainly would've taken it back. 

This was just another bad experience in a long line of them for me. Sad to say bc it used to be one of my FAVORITE places to eat,  but I'll be looking for a new BBQ joint."}
{"text":"So I'm just not sold enough to give it four stars.. It's not that it was bad, the food was pretty good. Restaurant seemed very clean. Service was fine. I guess the food didn't blow me away and I feel you're not really getting what you pay for..prices are a little high for quality and portion size. I've never seen \"sides\" so small. 

I ordered from the lunch menu. I chose the spare ribs and the pork with a side of mac n cheese. The pork was very, very tender. The first bite I took I was like \"wow! This is going to be so good!\" But after that first bite everything else was just average. The pork comes with very little sauce but there's sauce at the table. Mac n cheese was probably my favorite part..it has a little kick to it.

Oh and we had an appetizer..the burnt ends,maybe? Those were really, really good! Definitely would get those again!"}
{"text":"Staff was very friiendly,food and drinks were great.I have never been to a place where I have enjoyed everything..However;my fries were cold they brought appetizer out after the meal,they were Johnny on the spot bringing out fresh fries.My server apologized for bringing wings out late. I can not believe my feast was only$18.49.If I lived in North Olmested,I would eat here once a week"}
{"text":"So, Famous Dave's has been sitting in my backyard, literally a stone's throw away, and no one cared to tell me why it was so Famous.  Well, luckily, my out-of-town friends took me along for a pick-up run cause they were dumbfounded that I had no clue...(smh vehemently).  While waiting for our All-American order, I couldn't help gawking at the lip-smacking, finger-licking, happily chewing satisfied carnivores! I soon became one of them once we got home and got down to devouring ribs, chicken, and links. The table was quiet for the first few minutes.  At some point, someone had to check in to make sure that everyone was okay.  The food was devastatingly delicious from cornbread to coleslaw!  Now that I've shared this breaking news with you, go and make your mouth happy."}
{"text":"I stopped in to try this new bbq spot i would have to say its pretty good i like the almost country living feel to the resturant the food was very good this place reminded me of bubba lous bodacious bbq in orlando witch i beleive probly is the best on the planet lol but this place is up there with them defenitly wont be dissapointed."}
{"text":"The smell before u walk in is more then enough to lead you to this place. We did nachos with brisket which is what u expect when u come to a BBQ place...not so good! Even then the brisket gave u a taste of what's to come! They have a full bar with a verity of awesome beer mine being Moose Drool was just the perfect pair to the BBQ. In any case we ended up going with the All American Feast which was plenty for 5 people with more to spare. Come in and check this place out you're self it's a good time with great food."}
{"text":"This steakhouse is a little pricey. But it's worth what you pay. Their food is well cooked and delicious. The staff is really nice. They gave us two more cornbread's and a ice cream for free. The atmosphere is nice and not too loud. They also have cool flame decorations around, which is think is their theme. All in all this is steakhouse I can recommend if your going out for dinner and what some real food."}
{"text":"Personal favorite BBQ place.  Even the corn on the Cobb is fantastic.  Loud like a BBQ place should be, wish the line was shorter, but success will do that to you.  You end up spending more than you thought and leaving knowing you can hardly walk, but it is well worth it."}
{"text":"Great service from Tom and Darryl tonight. We sat in the Bar area and these guys were really attentive. Food was excellent and plentiful. Highly recommend tips, brisket, pork and chicken. Ribs were kinda average. All the sides were very good. Coleslaw super. We will be back."}
{"text":"Loved the BBQ and wings! This is our family's favorite BBQ place. We go to Famous Dave's whenever we are in the area since there isn't one near our home."}
{"text":"Good BBQ, great happy hour. New brisket burgers are terrific"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience at this location of famous dave's. The service was excellent, the server went out of his way to make us happy!!! I ordered the BBQ baked potatoe off of the lunch menu, A large baker filled with cheddar cheese, butter, sour cream, and perfectly cooked brisket. It also came with bacon bits which i opted to decline that topping. The price was $6.99. I also added a side salad for $2.99, It was fresh, cold, and crisp. The dressing (blue cheese) was great!!! tasted like they make it in house rather than coming from a jar.

My personal pet peeve is when a restaurant serves un-filtered water, Famous Daves serves filtered water. YAY!!! 

I will be goig back for more delicious mouth water BRISKET!!!!"}
{"text":"It's a good place to take the family for casual dinner. We were seated quickly. Food came out quick, but was a little cold. The array of bbq sauces made up for it.  The attention paid to customers was great!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious! I choose the 2 meat lunch meal and had the catfish and beef brisket with beans and it also came with corn bread. To top it off our waitress was sooo nice. She always made sure we were doing okay."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week. The best BBQ in Las Vegas by far. They have The best coleslaw I've ever eaten. Their pulled pork is amazing. Juicy tender and very tasty. The St louis Ribs are really meaty. They also have excellent sauces depending on your mood. Always very good service."}
{"text":"This place is the standard BBQ place.  To be honest, I really missed good ol' Rudy's BBQ back when I was in Austin.  This place had decent ribs, but the brisket was not that moist.  Been to a bunch of these, and overall, the meats at this joint wasn't that great.

I probably should've ordered a salad considering that night I wasn't feeling that great, but who the heck orders a salad at a BBQ place."}
{"text":"As someone who spent the last seven years living in Tennessee and north Carolina this place was a disappointment. I guess if you don't know real bbq it is probably fine but there is nothing famous about this place.  Won't go back again. They do have really cheap happy hour appetizers if you can deal with the fast food style bbq."}
{"text":"Usually good but last time there ribs were reheated. I know my ribs and no matter what they tell you they do reheat day old ribs. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"On my first visit to Famous Dave's (near Bass Pro) I was pleasantly surprised with the wide variety of choices.  As a fish enthusiast I pondered the BBQ choices but gravitated to the beer-battered cod to accompany a tall Sam.  The waiter commented he has the beer-battered cod sandwich every week but I chose the beer-battered cod combo in order to try sides of beans and coleslaw.  The beans were not the ordinary baked beans  out of the can but had a fancy name called Wilbur beans (\"baked beans loaded with smoked pork, brisket, hot link and jalapeno peppers\").  Although I added one of the mild sauces the beans were quite tasty.  The coleslaw was also not the ordinary store bought coleslaw but was called creamy coleslaw (\"A zesty slaw that's pineapple sweet with a hint of horseradish\"}.  Again quite tasty.  Getting back to the cod it was real fish that flaked like it should!! The cod was a generous portion and I actually received enough tartar sauce without asking for seconds.  All in all, a good choice after a long hike in the Superstitions with a stop off at Bass Pro for hiking essentials."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Very good portion sizes and great flavor! However, they took away the chips that they once used to give so you could eat with the sauces... So one of the reasons why I didn't give them 5 stars. Also, my husband ordered an additional meat for 4.99 (he ordered chicken) and they brought a very small piece to him, which they then brought us a different piece; still not too big but they were very nice in swapping it out. I would say the additional meat is not worth it for chicken at least. But, overall, great for what it is... BBQ food!"}
{"text":"Almost always great ribs, love the BBQ Sauces, and fun and pleasant service."}
{"text":"Old Faithful For A Good Meal!

Famous Dave's is always a safe bet for a good lunch or dinner. The staff is usually friendly and the tea is actually sweet like it should be. 

I really like the Sweetwater Catfish with drunken apples and green beans. 

Good music and a cool atmosphere make for a good spot to snack...."}
{"text":"Famous Daves has always been one of my main go to spots across the USA!

This spot is good and meets the Famous Daves standard!

The only bummer is parking is limited during peak hours but I won't let that from the rating....

Difficult to go wrong here...

They also do a free meal for us veterans on Veterans Day!

Thanks for the 2 meat salute!!!"}
{"text":"Easy Reliable Go To For Good Food!

Famous Dave's is a safe bet for a decent feeding... The catfish is my favorite here, but pretty much everything I have had here is good. 

They also have real sweet tea so you don't have to try to mix sugar in with your ice filled drink like most places!

If you have not fried Dave's you should check it out."}
{"text":"I've eaten at several Famous Dave's. All were good, but this location was just great. Great food. Staff was crazy amazing, attentative, and polite. Short wait for seating as well as food. And perfectly brewed sweet tea! Recommended."}
{"text":"There new happy hour specials are great!  Try the brisket or pulled port nachos or get some tasty wings with Devils Spit bbq sauce!!"}
{"text":"This would be first horrible experience ever at Famous Dave's last night me and my boyfriend decided to go out to eat after a long day of doctor visits and surgical procedure done. We arrive about 9pm their not that busy clearly we get seated in the bar area. The waiter comes to us 10 minutes after being sat down to ask what we wanted to drink. We ordered our drinks and catfish appetizer.  He brings us our waters 5 minutes later the food came out in pretty decent time.  But clearly the order was wrong but we didn't fuss about it. Cause the table in front of us is as already fussing. But it took 25 minutes for refills the waiter was to busy with closing the bar which clearly it was only 930pm or he disappeared . My boyfriend was upset with the rib tips and he didn't get his other side. We were to tired to fuse again. After we finished we asked for boxes the waiter said they didn't have any boxes but brought us two super small boxes for friggin ribs and the rest of our food. How are we supposed to fit ribs and everything thing else left over in this box.  After spending almost 60.00 for the two of us it is the first time I have to say I was so unhappy leaving feeling like they didn't care about us spending our money there. My boyfriend said he's never coming back and it was his first time."}
{"text":"Was so looking forward to bbq, got a brisket sandwich, it was nothing but strips of beef with equal amounts of fat. I had never seen so much fat on a brisket sandwich. A couple of the pieces were nothing but fat. Asked for something leaner, they brought the same fatty brisket out. Awful and I can't believe they expected someone to eat it."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this restaurant for lunch.  The ribs I ordered were not baby back ribs, instead spare ribs. My husband ordered a brisket sandwich that was horrific.  They should be ashamed to bring this food out to any customer.  We have crossed this restaurant off our list of places to dine out at.  Do not waste your money at this restaurant. The only positive is we had a very friendly waitress that was very attentive to us."}
{"text":"Britney was our server tonight on the patio. Great experience! Thank you!! Incredible pineapple too!"}
{"text":"Should've waited until I had a coupon or went somewhere else. Food came out cold and not much of it for the price. I split the 2 meat meal that was $18 with my daughter. My others daughters meals were not fantastic either. It just seemed over priced for cold mediocre BBQ. Maybe it was an off night? There were only a few other people there? Maybe I have to high of expectations? Don't think we'll ever be back?"}
{"text":"By far my favorite BBQ place, the mac & cheese is also amazing here can't miss out on that. If you have a bigger party the all American feast is the way to go, $65 and it feeds 4-6 people. I had a party of 12 I ordered 2 of the feast & still had left overs! Great service for the employees there as well!"}
{"text":"We had Landon tonight and he was awesome! I have a gluten allergy and he assisted with grabbing the the ingredient sheet so I can find something. Let me know another great alternative to the Sweet & Zesty BBQ sauce which made my salad even better. Always had our drinks filled and cleaned off our table in a timely matter from appetizer to dinner. From one server to another, great job! Thank you :)"}
{"text":"After many pleas to try  Famous Dave's I finally caved in (sorry but I'm not really a BBQ type of girl). I was pleasantly surprised. We walked in and it look really busy but we were seated right away, so that was really nice. I ordered their bleu cheese burger and it was probably the best bleu I've had! Their wings were pretty good and I loved the different sauces they had at the table - Devil's Spit was my favorite! It was a little tangy, sweet, and spicy with just enough kick. Our server and the staff were very nice so that just added to our positive experience. The next time I come back I'll definitely try some of the BBQ."}
{"text":"Muuuuch better than the average Famous Daves. Exellent service from Erica L. made this much more than just good BBQ. Full slab of St. Louis glazed were fired just right. Huuuge pile of tips were good for spouse, she had tons of leftovers. Bread pudding for finish was huge like a brick. All three adults ate on it and it was plenty. Much larger portions than any other Famous Daves I have been to. The ten year old with us even got a balloon. Probably the best BBQ meal I have ever had.....not in Memphis...right here in AZ."}
{"text":"I feel like I've had better meals at Famous Dave's in the past, but my last trip was pretty disappointing--none of the food served in the already dark and drab atmosphere looked or tasted good enough to get even remotely excited about dining there.

I got the 1/2 rack of baby back ribs and Texas beef brisket combo.  The ribs were not at all meaty, a little on the tough side, and not that flavorful despite the hand-rubbed spices and sauce on the grill.  The brisket was a little bit better, especially when drenched in one of the five available sauces, though the cuts seemed a little small.  I got sides of broccoli, potato salad, and the set sides of a cornbread muffin and a 2-inch piece of corn on the cob.  The broccoli is nothing special but fit its purpose.  I would stay away from the potato salad in future visits.  The cornbread and corn on the cob were decent.  I made the mistake of getting a \"sundae\" for dessert, which consisted of a three scoops of low quality vanilla ice cream in a big bowl with three piles of whipped cream and Hershey's chocolate syrup.  In fact, that description gives it too much credit, given how unceremoniously and hastily put together it looked.

Based on a number of visits quite a while ago, I had the thought in my head that Famous Dave's had better food than its fellow Great Northern Mall rival Smokey Bones BBQ & Grill.  It may be time to retest that proposition."}
{"text":"We ate there recently and the food was great. Though there is a wait to get in, that goes quick with free slices of sausage and pickles to whet your appetite. 

The food on the menu seems like its not enough, but believe me, its more than enough. 

Good food, friendly staff, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The food is very consistent. Good quality. Bathrooms are clean. Pretty large seating area. Great for groups. They changed the music selection to mostly country :("}
{"text":"Hit Famous Dave's last night with the wife, a couple of the daughters, and a couple of their friends.  Even though we had a variety of people who would eat this, but not that. Everyone was able to find something they found interesting.
Famous Dave's, especially for a large chain, is always solid.  The baby backs were a little scrawny but well smoked.  The brisket was similarly cut from a slab a bit smaller than I would use to smoke myself, but again tender and flavorful.  Even the smoked chicken salad and cedar plank salmon was well done.
True there is better BBQ in town (Bootleggers, Black Mountain), but Famous Dave's may be the best large BBQ chain in the country.
Well worth it."}
{"text":"After camping in the dessert for 6 days during Spring break, all we wanted was a Cold Beer and some solid comfort food. We also wanted to celebrate that one of our friends got into a top graduate program with some beers. When we got there and showed them our California IDs they said that because they were still vertical we could not drink. We looked up the law on the Arizona Licor license government website and attempter to communicate to the manager that the Law only applied to Arizona IDs - this was clearly stated on the legal document. The manager Brad was extremely rude had no interest in discussing and it just seemed like he needed to arbitrarily prove a point. However, the two waiters were absolutely fantastic. Ray Ray was wonderful. Probably the best service we received in all of Peoria. He was genuinely nice, respectful and was looking out for our best interest. Ray Ray definitely gets 5 stars. The food portions were large  and well priced. However, I spent the entire next day with heart burn (I could just not be used to it). Their homemade ranch was great. We did end up getting beer THREE HOURS LATER at the end of the meal once the manager had talked to the regional manager and owner who happened to be there that night."}
{"text":"So we walk in and are greeted, sat at a 6 top (there's 3 of us) all booths are dirty. So I ask when you have a clean one can we move. Our server tells the hostess who then throws a fit about It while I'm watching. The server tells her well now they want to move. The hostess walks past me angry that she has to clean the table and so I said well if it's a big deal we won't move. She laughed at me and ignored my comment. I'm so annoyed that I promise you this will be my last visit. Server is very professional, but when she initially saw she had another table she was annoyed. Sorry you have to do your JOB!!!"}
{"text":"Outrageously large portions, good enough to share with the whole family.  The baked beans are also FANTASTIC as a side as well as the slaw.  

I'm not a huge fan of the BBQ sauces, but the meat is just right :)"}
{"text":"This is my dads favorite restaurant and we were celebrating his birthday today. We have dined at this location for many years. Today was such a bad experience from beginning to end. 

My grandmother utilizes a walker and it was difficult to navigate thru the tables that were so close together. The young host didn't anticipate this and should have seen this and seated us somewhere more accessible for her. 

We sat at the table and the lunch menu has dirty finger prints with tons of nasty BBQ sauce on it. When the manager came around I pointed it out to him and he laughed it off and took it from us. 

I ordered a draft beer and it was flat, since our server was  lacking attentiveness, I walked to the bar myself and was given another one which was better. 

Family ordered lunch portions ribs and I ordered a loaded baked potato. It was such a joke. $8 for a potato that was anything but loaded. I requested additional toppings as it hardly had anything in it. (see pics) 

Other tables service was good, a plate with the dog drawn in it in BBQ sauce, a description of the different sauces, assistance with menu items. Non of this was received by our table. We couldn't even get a 2nd glass of water with our meals. 

Finally as we are leaving, I'm so irritated at this point, we leave thru the take out door as it's closer for my grandmother and the rug is so soiled and disgusting. 

This location needs a good scrubbing and a new set of eyes to make some necessary changes."}
{"text":"Thought we'd try something different tonight as we're celebrating my boyfriends birthday week.  We have both been to Famous Dave's before just never together.  
We arrived about 715pm and we always sit at the bar,  especially during football season.  The bar had 2 guests souring at it and the remainder of the bar was dirty. Not one open seat inviting us in.  As we stood there,  i finally spoke up and asked the bartender if we can sit there, and he finally started cleaning up.  
I thought ok,  let's give this guy a chance,  he probable just finished a rush and hadn't pickled up yet.  
Ummm no!!!! The service continued to decline and the mess just piled up. 
Boyfriend and I finished first beer and waiting 10 or 15 minutes before I asked across the beer for 2 more beers. REALLY?  this is crappy service.  
Not only did the bartender wait on the bar guests,  he was responsible for all the tables in tyne bat and the outside patio.  While he was outside I could have served myself quicker.  Not very smartly thought out. 
Service was crappy,  food was cold,  dirty restaurant.  Very disappointed in this location.  Even saw manager running food out,  but never stopped to greet tables or round  on guests.  Obviously this location is lacking from management down.  Chandler mall and mesa riverview will get my business next time.

UPDATE 11/3 Impressed that the General Manager attempted to call me to speak with me regarding my experience, however after each of us leaving a message for one another, it didnt go any further than that. The ball was left in his court and he never attempted again. Guess he REALLY didnt want to talk to me. Too bad!!"}
{"text":"Deeeeeelicious.

Drop the Pepsi products and I'll bump you to five stars."}
{"text":"The only BBQ place I'll eat. The ribs are great and the chicken strips are greater! Unfortunately they stopped making chips to try their sauces with, I guess even BBQ is affected by the economy."}
{"text":"Great finger licking BBQ plate for the family. Had all the meats and they do a great job describing the sauces to you.

Little pricey but you forget once you try their BBQ. You can also buy their recipes rubs and sauces. If you order to go they are tight with sauces, eat in and have plentiful of BBQ."}
{"text":"Doesn't get better than this, the guys at the Chandler Mall location do it right, every time!"}
{"text":"Never before have I lived in an area where Famous Dave's has a happy hour - but theirs is so great.  Their Devil's Spit (hot) sauce might be one of my favorites ever created.  To get six of these little drumstick beauties for $4 is just perfect.  The other stuff here is great too - the brisket, the hot links, the ribs - but I'm a sucker for a nice cheap happy hour & these guys deliver."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken fingers and fries from them through Uber eats. I paid 16$ total with delivery. They gave me 13 fries, and 2 chicken strips. I have ate here before and that is just unacceptable. The manager then said that it was Uber eats fault. I won't be ordering here again as they did not offer anything on their part. Bad experience overall."}
{"text":"I'm not one to complain about free food However, I've never been to a Famous Dave's and, since they were having free meals for veterans and I love BBQ, I decided to come here. Going to college full time, I don't have a lot of extra cash but every other month I like to go out and have someone cook a nice meal for me. Since this was free, it gave me the chance to see if I liked it and, if I didn't, no big loss cuz I didn't waste any money. It was a busy night, which I'm sure is typical since it's a Saturday and in a mall area. Sat myself up at the bar, was immediately greeted by a woman who has obviously worked here a few years, very professional and very friendly. Unfortunately, she wasn't the one to take my order. A very shy girl who seemed a bit lost at times took my order, but she was nice. The food took some time and I wasn't worried about that because I expected it to be fresh and, also, they were busy. The guy next to me actually ended up speaking to the manager right after I ordered about how his order and his wife's order was wrong and also cold. He made the same excuses I've already laid out: they're really busy. Slammed in the kitchens. I mean, look around, with this many people, there is obviously going to be a wait and most reasonable people will understand that. When the food arrived, I had no silverware. Luckily, my waitress happened to look over about that time and notice me looking around for some, which she immediately provided and apologized for not having out in advance. Without going overly into details as I usually do, let's just suffice it to say that everything on the plate was cold. Not like room temperature cold but like it was in the fridge for a little bit cold. I still ate everything which was the Texas Brisket, Georgia Ribs, and Garlic Mashed Potatoes. The flavor, at least on the ribs and potatoes, were good. Probably would've been much better if hot and/or fresh. The brisket was... very meh. Yes, it fell apart just like it should but it just tasted like cold roast beef from the deli section at the grocery store. Not once during the meal was I ever asked if everything was ok, did I need anything else, would I like some water, etc. Also, the wet napkins tray only had one in it. Also, a couple of the waiters kept diving over the bar to grab stuff, one of which actually ran into me while I was sitting at the bar. Oh, and I forgot to mention when I was first walking in, the girl sitting outside asked her co-worker, while she was escorting me to the bar, to make sure the male waiters didn't steal anymore of the blank name tags because they kept drawing penises on them and sticking them everywhere. Again, super glad this was free and all I wasted was my time. The rule is usually three strikes, you're out but... this was just such a bad overall first impression that I'm not going to give it another attempt. Sorry guys."}
{"text":"Food: for a chain restaurant, not bad.  You could tell that the meat was actually smoked.  Portion size was normal.  The cornbread was especially good, but the green beans were disappointing.  I would also add that the portion size of the side dishes was on the small side.

Service: friendly, and our food and drinks were generally brought to the table on time.

Might not be as good as Bubba's Q., but close."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's is kind of like the McDonalds of barbeque.  You know exactly how it's going to taste.  It's not all that authentic, but it's still tasty.

However, there are much better barbeque places in this town, so why waste your time here?"}
{"text":"So we left the inferior Famous Dave's and came to the great one. The service as soon as we walked in was head and shoulders above all expectations once again. Ribs, rib tips, brisket and wing piles later, we are full and happy. Cole, our server, was awesome both times he waited on us and both managers that we have met have made the experience over the top. This will definitely become our go to bbq place from now on."}
{"text":"So we came in to give them a chance at redemption, and they did. The brisket was good, the service was good. And we will leave it at that."}
{"text":"My family and I ordered a big butt load of food.  They have this platter I'll refer as big butt load of food because that what it is.  They have everything on this platter for you to try.  I enjoy the ribs the most for obvious reasons - they fall right off the bone yum!  The chicken and tri-tip wasn't much to rave about - corn bread muffin style that's pretty cool.  Big butt load of food also came with some corn on a cob & some wedge potato fries (according to Man vs. Food eat the carbs last)  There wasn't much of a drink special - mostly for mix drinks - yeah what's up with that?  I want beer with my BBQ man!  Ambience is alright southern rock n roll with some down home feel.  Service was good and they were on top of it.  The BBQ sauce I gotta say they had enough on the food, but with 5 different flavors you can't help but play around with it (Try the Devil's Spit!)"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited today for lunch.  We were promptly greed and seated.  Our waitress quickly brought us menu's and took our drink order.  She returned with drinks and asked if we had any questions.  We needed a few more minutes to peruse the menu's.  After a while she returned and took our order.  Then she did a interesting little presentation with the various BBQ sauces on a plate. Pretty cool.  A small bowl of crispy potato chips was brought over (I assume) for sampling these sauces. Here is where things got sticky, literally.  My menu had dried BBQ sauce on several spots.  There were several sticky rings on the table surface from previous diners beverages.  Our meals arrived and tasted OK.  I had brisket with St. Louis Ribs and Broccoli.  It was a tad drier than I like, but still tender.  The ribs were not fall off the bone and required a little more work, but still satisfied me.  My wife was pleased with her selection.  After we left my wife noticed I had taken some BBQ sauce with me - on the seat of my shorts.  Bottom line - Service was great and food was OK.  They could do a better job of cleaning the menu's, booths and tables - cleanliness is next to Godliness!"}
{"text":"This is one of the better Famous Dave's I've been to in the Western portion of the USA.  We miss the Famous Dave's that are throughout the South which are sooo much better than the ones out West, but this Famous Dave's is pretty good!

Restaurant~ great location, easy in and out access to the 202 Hwy.  This place is huge with plenty of room to accommodate loads of people and they are very \"kid friendly\".  The bar is a very nice area to eat and drink with again plenty of room and seating.  It's very clean and you will have a hay day playing \"eye spy\" with the kiddos.

Service~ better than what you would expect from a chain restaurant.  They are very quick to take your order and attentive to your drink needs.  They are not experts on what is on their menu, but then again it's a chain...

Food~ A-OK BBQ especially if your taking someone that is not a fan of BBQ.  Famous Dave's trys to cater to all BBQ fans by offering a six pack of sauces to choose from on your table with flavorings from Kansas City, Texas and the Carolina's.  Their BBQ is based on the sauce and not the actual BBQ cooking.  Their ribs, brisket, and pulled pork are cooked and taste more like pot roast to me rather than BBQ.  The meat is mushy and moist because of their sauce but it has pretty good flavor.  The Texas Manhandler and their Rib Tips are very popular and a recommend.   The fries are also very popular and tasty.  I would pass on the mac-n-cheese because it tasted blah even with the added jalapeno's and corn.  

This is a great place to take the family and friends.  It's a fun place to eat, the service is real good and their food is not bad.  I hope to see you there!"}
{"text":"Famous Daves knows BBQ. The problem is it's usually kind of expensive.
Here's a tip: Go during their happy hour. If you do that, you'll get the same amazing food and a much better price, or dare I say it, \"for cheap\"? 
The inside of the restaurant has a bunch of junk hanging everywhere, but that's their shtick, and I dig it. The outdoor patio is nice if you have little ones as it's completely enclosed. The service was good and our waitress went above and beyond. I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Average food with good service.  Family friendly.  We've had the ribs, sliced brisket, and pulled pork.  All are okay, nothing super great, but not super disappointing...just what I'd call average.  The sliced brisket was not dry like it can be at some other BBQ places.  The ribs are the firmer \"al dente\" kind, so not for those who have a big preference for the fall-off-the-bone type of ribs.  We all LOVED the fresh made BBQ flavored potato chips that they give you before your meal.  My husband really likes their mashed potatoes. The server was pleasant and attentive.  Drinks never got low before another was offered.  

Go at lunchtime for smaller, cheaper portions on the lunch menu.  If you're looking for AMAZING BBQ, this isn't it, but it's good enough for an occasional lunch out with the family."}
{"text":"My last barbecue experience outside of the state of Texas was not so good. I was in Colorado Springs for work, and none of the barbecue was noteworthy. This time, work had me going to Cleveland, OH. I was born and raised in the Cleveland area. When I was a kid, I remember eating ribs and liking it. That was my extent of Cleveland \"barbecue.\" I had trouble finding a barbecue restaurant that served brisket. I made a mistake to stop by the \"best\" barbecue restaurant in the area. They only served ribs, wings, and fried chicken. Crud. Any other day that would have sounded good, but I was on a mission. I ended up going to Famous Dave's. They are a national chain and even have a location in Texas.

I ordered the St Louis spareribs and Texas brisket combo plate with two sides. The sides were fresh steamed broccoli and Dave's Cheesy Mac & Cheese. I also got a link of hot sausage. The brisket was just terrible. I ordered moist and got lean. I think? It tasted like a dry pot roast with barbecue sauce on it. I am not sure why the brisket was served on top of a slice of bread. I might have tasted some smoke, but I was not sure. I only had a few bites of it. That was not definitely Texas brisket. The ribs were a little better. They were tough and I thought they were grilled because I tasted no smoke. Although the sauce was sweet, it did hide the deficiency of the ribs. I only ate one and half ribs. The sausage was awful for smoked sausage. It was gray inside instead of a red color throughout. It was not smoked long enough. I had two bites of the sausage. Even the macaroni and cheese was not good. How do you screw that up? It had bits of corn and jalapeno in it. I did enjoy the steamed broccoli and cornbread though.

I asked the waiter at Famous Dave's what the cooking process was. The meats are smoked and then reheated on the grill when someone orders it. I had a lot of leftovers. I took the food to go because I felt bad. I thought I might see a homeless person and give them the food. I saw a picture of Ruby's B-B-Q when the owner visited Texas. I wished it was good as Ruby's B-B-Q. I would have been ecstatic if that was the case. After my visit, Famous Dave's was voted best in Cleveland. Most of us already feel sorry for the people of Cleveland, but this has to be the icing on the cake. When I was leaving, I saw another barbecue chain down the street. Smokey Bones. I might try it the next time I am in town for work."}
{"text":"Wow, they can do bbq right   I went with two other friends and we ordered the Feast for Two.  It was plenty of food for all three of us.  The chicken just fell off the bone, the brisket was just mouth watering goodness, the ribs were delicious as well!  The feast also came with sweet corn, coleslaw (best I've ever had), beans, and cornbread!  It was certainly a feast of deliciousness!  Fonzie was a very attentive waiter that made sure we had everything we needed and he checked on us regularly!  I'm already thinking about when I'll return for another meal!"}
{"text":"Lacks ability to seat patrons fairly.  Nobody on staff cares!  People that just walked in the door are being seated faster than my party of 6!  Possibly complaining about why we have not been seated made matters worse!!!  DO NOT PATRONIZE FAMOUS DAVE, NORTH OLMSTED!!"}
{"text":"We've never had an issue at this location in the past, but today we did. 
We sat in the bar area for lunch and had to fend off flies for the entire meal!  
Disappointing to say the least!!"}
{"text":"Been in Arizona for 2 weeks and I have eaten at Dave's Famous BBQ twice.  The server was a great, attentive and personable. The Burnt Ends melt in your mouth.  Reasonable prices especially at Happy Hour. I will be bringing guests back to this place!"}
{"text":"I had been pretty fond of Famous Dave's up until tonight.  Got a takeout order, as I have done before, and they've changed a few things.  The portions are smaller across the board (meat and sides).  In addition to that, the recyclable cardboard packages and plastic side containers have been replaced with styrofoam.  I'm not a total hippy, but when you make the food smaller AND murder the environment?  That's a lot for me.

Also, the food wasn't very hot and the fries have turned to garbage.  I'm not sure if I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Great food, great customer service, no long wait, my only complaint make sure you but lids on your deserts, when someone is taking it to go."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's day, free food for Dave's today...
Great rid dinner the Rib-n-Rib plate a little bit of baby back and St. Lewis ribs they were both delicious.
Great atmosphere, Great service (even being so busy with Dave's Day)"}
{"text":"The place was absolutely the best. Everything about my experience there was pleasant. The staff was knowledgeable about the products they were serving and very accommodating. They also did a little presentation about the different types of sauces they have and gave complementary chips was bbq rub on them. The food was great too and probably the best bbq I've ever had. The meat especially the chicken and brisket were tender, juicy, and tore apart easily. I ordered the meat combo that came with 2 types of meat, 2 side dishes, and a corn bread muffin. All this came to around $18. For the price you are paying, you definitely get your moneys worth. The staff were great and the food was amazing so I definitely recommend it if you enjoy bbq."}
{"text":"Wow! Their lunch portions are huge! I expected small lunch portions for my beef brisket and BBQ tips... no there was plenty! On top of that you get a cornbread muffin and a side you can pick! Their sauces are awesome too!"}
{"text":"I drive from North Phoenix/Scottsdale just to get my Famous Daves BBQ fix. Sad, yes but they make some hella good BBQ. The ribs are tender and juicy, the baked beans, the mashed tators, and the green beans are so good, they make you wanna smack yo momma. Well maybe not that good, but darn near close enough. Oh and don't forget about the the cornbread muffins. Always warm and yummy. See now I need my BBQ fix once again. Seriously though, I really do enjoy their food and their Devil's Spit BBQ sauce is on point! Make sure to try a skewer of shrimp or the BBQ wings. YUMMO!"}
{"text":"Nothing special, but not bad if you're in Madison (a city void of good bbq) and have a craving for bbq. I've had the brisket and the pulled pork a few times. It's always been cooked well, decently flavorful. The sides are ok, and the portions are big for the price. Service is always friendly and pretty fast. 3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Been here before.  Love the casual atmosphere, the barbecue and meats are tender.  Service fast and food flavorful.  Great place for a quick bite and fast service."}
{"text":"This is our 2nd favorite place for barbecue & is great if you have a large group of people. We have been there multiple times. We normally order the family meal which is served in a round metal garbage can lid which at first seems off-putting but we have gotten used to it. My favorite is the sweet tea (you can't find that in most restaurants in our area), the cornbread & the pulled pork. My least favorite is the ribs. 
They include fresh made potato chips before your meal.
They had an email club which actually sends you coupons (unlike some others I have joined like Bucca de Beppo & Cracker Barrel) as well as a birthday coupon.
Don't forget to ask for butter if you like it with your cornbread (which is sweet & moist) or corn on the cob.
It is often busy & loud so keep that in mind when you are planning your dining experience."}
{"text":"Firstly why is it called Famous Daaves BBQ?
1. Who is Dave?
2. Is Dave really famous?
I walked in, curious to try the food. The decoration is cute, lots of sign boards everywhere. My waiter was pretty awesome. We had 6 bottles of BBQ sauce on our table and he explained every single one of them, the flavor, how hot / sweet it was, what it was made of. Then he brought us a plate of potato chips so we could try each sauce. I liked the original and the sweet/zesty one. I was afraid of trying the XXL sauce because it was super spicy. Spicy food makes me cry.
I ordered from the lunch menu and decided on the St. Louis ribs. It came with a corn muffin, corn on the cob and your choice of side, I had broccoli.
When my food came, I only had 3 ribs.  I was expected at least half a slab. St. Louis ribs aren't that great, the meat isn't that tender and there is too much fat. Baby back ribs are so much better, baby ribs are always WINNING!
The corn muffin was excellent. Corn on the cob, can't say much, just has lots of butter so it tastes good.
At the end of the meal, the waiter gave us a free bottle of original bbq sauce."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's has been a family favorite dinner place since I moved to the Mesa Riverview area. We have enjoyed everything from a casual dinner to birthdays here. We always order the family platter, which is a massive amount of food! Their pork, brisket and ribs are the best! The cornbread is also great.

For around $70, you can feed 6 people and still have food to take home! The BBQ sauces are also tasty with the chips they bring out before the food. I like the sweet and tangy sauce the best. 

The best part about Dave's BBQ is that they do FREE dinners for anyone named David or Dave on their anniversary. That's been a benefit for me since my dad is David and a good friend is Dave. Only thing I've ever had here that I wouldn't order again is the chocolate brownie dessert. The flavor of the brownie was off and I didn't enjoy it.

Good food, fun vibe and friendly staff here. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"The barbecue was good but not great. They do have a nice selection of barbecue sauces. The complimentary kettle chips were a nice touch. On the plus side, the food came lightning fast."}
{"text":"Great meal! Service was friendly and fast and everything we tried was delicious. Loved the Burnt Ends appetizer--small chunks of caramelized brisket served with pickled onions and  spicy pickle slices. They also served a small bowl of complementary kettle-cooked potato chips which were awesome. I can't believe they don't package and sell them.

The chopped pork was moist and flavorful and so was my husband's brisket. The beans were delicious and not overly sweet and salty as in a lot of bbq places. Excellent cornbread. And the mac and cheese was unique in that it had whole kernel corn and jalapeno in it--very tasty! The garlic mashed potatoes were just ok.

Great bbq sauces--my favorite was the Georgia Mustard and hubby liked the Sweet & Zesty so much he bought a bottle on his way out!

Overall great bbq-- a LOT better than Rudy's or Can't Stop Smokin' which left both my husband and me underwhelmed when we tried them early this year."}
{"text":"Service and Food were EXEMPLARY!!! We sat in the bar area and the bartender/waiter was attentive, punctual, and generous. 
Later, the manager made his rounds and ensured we were well l taken care of (which we were).
This visit was the best we've had to date; from any restaurant and we are happy to recommend and return!
(You'll be lucky to be visit during William's shift. He'll take care if you!)"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating here tonight.  I was impressed.   Art, the manager, was very hospitable.  I enjoyed the brisket. See you!"}
{"text":"Yum!! Yum!! Just had lunch here with my wife and it
was really great, Our server Ali was very nice and brought us 
out our food in record time! The variety of BBQ sauce they have is fantastic.
At least 5 different flavors at each table, I had the lunch combo sampler
with Rib Tips, BBQ Chicken it came with a side of fries, a cornbread muffin
(so much food I had to get a take home box) My wife had a Pulled Pork sandwich
and we both left very happy and satisfied"}
{"text":"This review is for UberEats and Famous Dave's, They got the order to us very quickly and the food was still very warm. They included giant sauce packets, plates and even plastic silverware and napkins which I thought was a very nice touch! My friend got the ribs and I got the brisket and we even got a side of wings, everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"I went here during my lunch and was meeting up with a friend. She got there first and ordered us water that was supposed to have lemon but didn't. Not a big deal of course, since we were going to have a margarita anyway. Once I arrived, the host working was really helpful in helping me find my friend and he was extremely friendly. We were sitting in the bar area, with Jenn, I think her name was, as our server. My friend and I both have worked at restaurants before so we understand how it goes. However, our server was horrible. She made us feel like we had to rush in making an order by attempting to grab all the menus once we ordered our beverage. Once we did figure out our order, she did not give us time to tell her we wanted substitutions. She just took the order and left. The food was alright, nothing special in my opinion, but our server seemed like we were a burden to her day. It was not busy in the bar area when we were there, and she was more focused on her patio tables rather than her whole section. She took forever to realize that we were done eating and that we needed our check. Once we paid, we realized the amount we were charged and the amount on the original receipt were different amounts. She wasn't around for us to ask her what that was about, and I didn't have any more time to sit around and wait for her to come back. This was my first time coming to this establishment and I'm not going back just because of this experience"}
{"text":"Well, usually I have a good experience here. Maybe this time it was just an off day or under a new manager?

Our meal started of waiting 40 minutes for our food. Tables next to us who sat down after us were eating already. Our server never addressed our long wait until we stopped her and asked. We actually asked another server about our food first. When our server returned from checking on our food, she told us the manager was checking on our food. Wait. Isn't that what she did? She was also quite annoying delivering drinks and items to the table with weird presentation \"sounds.\" Quite odd unless you're at Chucky Cheese.

5 minutes later the manager brought our food with only a \"here you go.\" No explanation, no apology, no offer of compensation. Obviously manager in name only. The food was warm so was easy to see it had been sitting awhile. One of the items that was brought out was corn on the cob. No butter. Had to flag someone down for that too. Shouldn't that be a mandatory item you bring to the table ESPECIALLY with corn on the cob? 

When done with our meal we asked for boxes which were brought with a bag. We boxed up the items and set them on top of the bag for the time being. Our server asked me if I'd like her to put the boxes in the bag. I said no thanks I have it. When I next looked, the bag was gone. Note to server, if you want to know if I want the bag, ask that question, not another question.

I might go again, but certainly this experience was nothing to expedite another trip."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Got the plate for two and it was wayyy more food than we could eat. Food is good and comes out pretty quick. Not a bad place to go to. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Was good and on par for what it is. Mashed potatoes seemed a little fake, and the soda was flat and only had like 2 ice cubes floating in it. Service was nothing special. All in all, it was Famous Daves."}
{"text":"Our meal was fabulous-! We both ordered the brisket lunch special. The meat was tender and flavorful, juicy but not fatty. I couldn't finish mine, so my husband happily had the last slice. I had the fries, ok. My hubby had the beans which he said were some of the best he has had (mine excepted!) They were very meaty. The cornbread muffins were a little too sweet for me. Every famous staff member was super professional and friendly! Awesome. Our food came so quickly I thought it couldn't be ours. Our waitress was very attentive without being pushy or hovering. I hate to be rushed, but find it equally frustrating to have to wsit for oir check, change, etc. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Consistent food, nice family atmosphere and spicy pickles.  What more could you want?"}
{"text":"I went in about 9:30 after babysitting my grandchildren for the evening so I could take advantage of their happy hour prices. I knew I wanted the catfish strips which come to $5 at happy hour price. You can't go wrong with that! I decided to get a Lifted Kilt beer, my new guilty pleasure, and got four ribs knowing I would probably end up taking half my dinner home to make another meal. The ribs are only $1 apiece so it's easy to splurge.  The Lifted Kilt beer was only $2 for the 14 ounce size. They have a 22 ounce size for only $3 at happy hour but I figured if I got that I wouldn't be able to even drive home. 

Everything was delicious and the service was good, at least until the end. The only seats inside the bar area where tall stools which I don't do well on since I'm short. The weather was pleasant so I sat outside but I was the only one out there. They guy checked up on me adequately but when he brought my bill toward the end he almost ran away from me before I could ask for a to-go box. Then he never came back to collect my credit card payment.  After waiting about 10 minutes or more for him to return I gathered up my leftovers and bill and went to the hostess stand and told the hostess I wanted to leave but my waiter never came back for my payment. There was no one at the stand when I first walked up. I probably could have walked right out and they would have assumed I paid but I wouldn't do that to somebody, not my style. The hostess was very pleasant and instead of asking me to wait for my server which I was afraid she would do, she just took the bill and credit card and came back quickly with the copy for me to sign and one to keep. I signed it and set the folder on her stand and left. I didn't doc the tip much, just rounded it down instead of up like I usually do. He was a fine server until the end. I think he just forgot about me since I was the only one out there. Either that or else he found a cute girl to flirt with and THEN forgot about me. Who knows?"}
{"text":"Very relaxing, enjoyable birthday lunch with mom and dad and my two sons. We had a variety of meals from the lunch menu plus an order of burnt ends. All of it was good, but the burnt ends were heavenly."}
{"text":"every time I go here, the food just plain rocks. I love having all the different types of BBQ sauces at my table at once. never had a bad experience here, and definitely a fan."}
{"text":"The meat had a great smokey flavor and the the sides were solid. Good service and reasonable prices as well."}
{"text":"We ordered through UberEats and didn't receive our ranch. I'm pregnant and was really upset that the ranch was missing. My husband went to the restaurant to get ranch and the Area Manager asked if he could help him. My husband nicely explained what happened and just asked for ranch. The Area Manager profusely apologized and hurried the kitchen staff to get ranch for my husband. He asked if there was anything else he could get for my husband and my husband said no just the ranch. The Area Manager then gave my husband a $15 gift card. Thank you for you superb customer service. Everyone makes mistake and forgetting ranch isn't normally a huge deal but I'm crazy and pregnant. Thank you again. We will continue to order from here and eat here!!"}
{"text":"After a long weekend at a kung fu seminar my sifu had, and REALLY bad food a had in scottsdale, I was thinking to myself AZ food sucks!!!!!! I don't live in AZ but I go there atleast once a year and when I leave I am disapointed and wishing I'm back in CA for real food. One of my friends that live there challenged my complaint and brought me to Famous Dave's Barbeque. You know i loves me some bbq but this is AZ how good can it be?? 

WoW!!!! This place is off the hook!!!!! we ordered the dinner sampler which had chicken, hot links, BRISKET!!, ribs, and some sides. They were all feakin OFF DA HOOK man!!!! Especially the brisket!! i think it was the best i ever had. they offered 4-5 different kinds of bbq sauce. I'm tellin ya i was in heaven!!! 

PLS forgive me AZ for i have sinned!! you have opened my eyes and i will never say the food sucks there again!!! 

THANK YOU SIR, MAY I HAVE ANOTHER!!!  :)"}
{"text":"Food was great!!! nicely smoked flavors and the sides were good too ...The only disappointment was the pecan pie was burt, and the bread pudding had good toppings but by its self was just plain and nasty. -1 for the after dinner snacks.

Will eat here again for sure..."}
{"text":"Famous Daves is great. I have tried joes and rudy's and this is the best. Had a small problem recently with a big group that was not a good experience, but it doesn't tarnish the good food. Try to keep it 10 and under and you will be good. Devils spit is the way to go."}
{"text":"BBQ is a personal thing, and for me, FD is what it is: chain BBQ. I'm not personally into receiving my barbecue drowning in sauce, I don't mind a little added at the end, but I like to taste what the original meat tasted like. I was impressed by how tender the meat was until I realized it had probably been tenderized with a sodium solution. the servings are huge, the sides are OK.

Really, Famous Dave's was OK. With other barbecue choices in the valley being superior, I'd pass on the chain and go looking authentic."}
{"text":"What I remember most of the 3 times I've been here is that it's cold. Like the AC blasts constantly at 65. I bring sweaters. Yes, plural. Sweaters.

The food is tepid/lukewarm. Doesn't that constitute a health code violation? This is a 2 star review that gets bumped up to 3 because the service was that good, girlfriend.

Of the 3 different times I've been here, I've always been extremely happy with the friendliness, courtesy and swiftness of their servers. Even at prime dinner time, food came out fast. I just wish it had been warm/hot.

Parking was starting to become an issue thanks to the new Toby Keith bar/grill that opened.

Service is good, but to be honest the food isn't that great."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's finally opened up near me in the Bay Area and I wanted to see what I had to say about the restaurant...color me surprised when I realized that in the 4 times I had eaten at Famous Dave's in Arizona, I had never written a review! Time to remedy that...

We came here on the weekend after it had first opened, back in 2006/2007. Service was good and snappy. Food was all right.

Without really knowing it, I had commented to hubby and our friend, \"I don't know what to make of this place, but something about it screams 'chain' to me. It doesn't feel very local.\" Sure enough, we got home and googled it...it's a chain.

While I dislike supporting chain restaurants (my experiences with BJ's is the one that comes to mind), this one made me go, \"ok, I can deal with it.\"

What hooked me was the corn muffin...which I dubbed the Corn Crack Muffin. Honey was evident throughout. I do not like honey, but it so worked on these muffins. I had to contain myself. I nearly made hubby go and flag a server down so I could eat his muffin (that sounds rude, doesn't it?) in his absence. The server liked us and I suspect it was due to hubby's Scottish accent...she kept bringing the Corn Crack Muffins. So much so that I was full when my food arrived.

I got the brisket and this is where the meal fell short for me - the fries were seasoned with so much salt that I was thirsty all night after. Portions of the brisket were not consistent with the pricing. I felt like I got ripped off. Food was just ok, but not enough to make me want to boost this up to 4 stars.

Server was great and I really commended them for the wonderful service in such a short time of being open. Most places take three months to a year to get it right.

The Manager was so enamored with hubby's accent that he gave us so many coupons and a couple of bottles of Dave's BBQ sauce, hoping to entice us to come back.

Make sure to get here early because it's situated right next to the Chandler Mall - it gets crazy and parking made me feel like I was in the Bay Area - fighting for that one spot that is remotely close to my destination.

Now...on to writing the review for the one on Dobson."}
{"text":"I treated my Mother-in-law to a Mother's day dinner here.  We were told it would be an hour wait, but braved it anyway, and it only ended up being 15 mins. Our waitress was very attentive and nice.  I ordered the St. Louis ribs and chopped pork.  The ribs were very good, the chopped pork was ok. The fries are supper yummy, the pickles and pickeled onions are also.  I think the sauces are pretty good.  My Mommy-in-law had the rib tips, and other than being more fatty than I like, they had a good flavor.  Overall, I like Famous Daves, it is consistent and it is good."}
{"text":"Mmmmm BBQ. 

Good meat, good sides. Pulled pork was excellent. Brisket was near the top rank of any brisket. The bean are my favorite of any place. Corn cobs were a bit bland and overcooked, but the cornbread was excellent! Good selection of sauces - you will like at least one, probably more.

Informal, casual low-brow style.

Good BBQ, Good Price. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Amazing. All I have to say is that the service was incredible. Our waiter Brandon ( I really hope that was what his name was) was knowledgeable and gave us a great rundown of their menu and sauces. He even drew us a little piggy in the sauces to explain each one! It was really a unique experiences. The food was better than he explained! We will definitely be back for round two!

THE DEVIL SPIT BURGER IS DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"Went to Famous Dave's for a friend's birthday, it looked like it was a turnout of about 20 people give or take, took up the back of the restaurant, but let me tell you the staff was fast, friendly, didn't get upset about separate checks, drinks were never empty, service was prompt  and every dish ordered was correct. I have to say I was impressed by this! I have seen places fail when coming having to sever a big party.

I also have to give big props to my server Miriam, on this evening I was the pushy patron, I told her that I needed to be out by 8pm and that didn't even phase her, she got my order done, gave me the check and had me done before 7:30pm. Miriam was very pleasant and came with a smile! She was part of the super team that served our party! Thank you Miriam!

I ordered the southside rib tips, came with fries and jalapeno pickled red onions and hell fire pickles,  the hell fire pickles were pickles that packed heat, love it! Reminded me of the spicy dill pickles, I didn't really try the red onions, not because I don't like onions, but I had a date to go run off to and didn't want to reek of onions, haha

The food, the service, the place was great! I do see myself coming back and enjoying some more good ole bbq!"}
{"text":"Yeah, yeah.. It's a chain.  But they DO smoke in-house and make some authentic 'cue.  Sauces are authentic to regions, and sides are well-made.  Not better than I can do at home, or some Austin. TX hole-in-the-wall. But among all the chains you'll find in most suburbs, they get my vote."}
{"text":"Excellent Bar-B-Que food.  Just recently had the Salmon.  Waiter was great and he said he's been there something like 8 years!  What does that say for the place?  They must take good care of their staff and also provide them with a place they love to work at.  We love to eat there. Prices are a little above inexpensive.  Atmosphere is nice.  A little crowded.  Bathrooms are pretty clean but not perfect.  We really like this place.  Wish it was larger.

Update:  Went here and ordered a burger.  Something has changed because the meat itself was lousy.   Nothing much different than  a fast food burger and actually a little worse.  What's up Famous Daves????

Update:  Just tried their BBQ chicken sandwich.  The flavor was just just ok.   Not bad but not Dave's Delicious.   The meat seemed a bit skimpy too.  Never noticed before but their buns are all white wonder bread.  Sorry Dave but that doesn't cut it with me.   Can't you do a better bun than that?   The service continues to be quite good here but I have to now say, stay away from their sandwiches.  They are sort of fast food quality.  Not what I expect from a good BBQ restaurant.

Update:  Went back again.   The Salmon was ok to good but the shrimp was awful.  It was like eating dry wads of newspaper.   Way, way overcooked.  No juiciness left in them.  It was carry out so we ate what we could and tossed the rest.  If I had been eating in they would have been sent back.   Truly the worst shrimp I have ever been served.
This is it for me.   Won't be going back here for some time.  They need a new chef.  Big mess.

Update:  Gave them another try. (two years later)  Had a delicious feast for two.  One complaint.  The corn sucks.  It needs to be replaced with something else.  Everything else was excellent.   Cost with tip: 53 dollars.  Not cheap."}
{"text":"The bbq is always good but if you place a to go order they are always about 10 minutes late.  They will start putting it together when you come in so if you need to pick it up come in 10 minutes early.  Especially if it is a large order"}
{"text":"I did a catering order where I ordered several pounds of brisket and pulled pork.  The brisket was tender and moist and had a good smoked flavor.  The mac n cheese as a side dish is a real hit, everyone loved it.  Famous Dave's also made a killed tray of sals with sliced tomatoes, cheese and bacon sliced into bits on top.  Had my order done on time and packed perfectly in aluminum containers.  Clean restaurant and friendly staff."}
{"text":"12 of us had lunch there. For a chain, it is not too bad. The meats are tender, you can pick your own sauces from the table, the cornbread is yummy! 

I had the STL ribs and pork brisket served with cornbread and mac & cheese. I do not know (OK, I did not read) that the mac & cheese has jalapeno peppers. My husband was sweet and trade his fries with me... Yes, I am a wimp when it comes to anything with temperature. Everything was good... The service was good... 

The food was not mouth water or jaw dropping GOOD! So 4 stars..."}
{"text":"Came across this place during my lunch time and decided to give it a try. I've only tried one other BBQ place in Arizona which is Bobby Q so I was excited to try a new place.

My husband and I were greeted and given menus. Jim, our waiter came and asked if this was our first time and yes it was. He was enthusiastic to show us all sorts of different sauces they have for us to try. There was a lunch special where you choose 2 meat and 1 side for just  $9.99. How can you beat that? My husband tried their St. Louie ribs and cod. I tried their roasted chicken and beef brisket. I would say I like all of the meat besides beef brisket. Their famous fries were ok (not fried enough for me). 

Overall I really liked the environment and the cheap meals! Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"This place has grown on me. I like the selection of different sauces. My favorite is the sweet and zesty. The St. Louis ribs are tasty. I like the corn bread and Wilbur beans a lot. I started coming here more often and the service has been pretty good lately as well."}
{"text":"My dad wanted BBQ for his birthday so we went to Famous Dave's. We had a pleasant experience.  We had a early dinner so they were still offering their lunch specials. (The specials go until 5).  I thought this was a cool deal. My portion was the perfect size. I really enjoyed the ribs and corn. My dad liked the brisket but he wished he hadn't ordered the potato salad. It had onions in it. Overall had a great dinner with my dad enjoying celebrating his birthday while eating some yummy BBQ."}
{"text":"Love BBQ! I recommend the Georgia Chopped Pork. They offer lunch specials Monday-Friday. 

Only complaint hostess didn't know anything about the lunch specials and what time it ended. He was telling me about happy hour which I didn't even ask about. Probably need to review the menu a little more and actually listen. 

Food was great. Love the corn on the Cobb too. It's a side dish. Plus the corn bread muffins. I love you so much! My server was awesome. She made a pineapple with the different sauces to introduce you to them. Great PR which sets them apart from the other BBQ places. I of course ate all of my food then felt guilty but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Our last visit was disappointing. The ribs were dry and clearly overdone. High prices for sub-standard barbq. Once you get past the trite decor, the food lands with a thud."}
{"text":"Just as expected. Always a great meal. The ribs and brisket were spot on!! Good service too. My only complaint is the broccoli was weird. Kind of spongy. But the meat is the deal!!!"}
{"text":"this place has gone down hill. i usually get the brisket sandwich with the  steak fries.(they just have regular fries and personally i would take in n outs fries over these). so it comes out and and I'm thinking wheres 11 bucks worth of food?? not on my plate. i would have overlooked the quantity if the fries were good and warm and the bun was fresh. i think there was maybe 4 pieces of brisket on the stale bun. and i mean half he bun was stale.i wasn't looking for a pound of meat or anything, but they used to give you a good serving anyways..

on a better note the waitress was very nice and kept apologizing. when the manager came by i just pointed out the quantity of food, temp of food, mediocre fries, and last but not least the stale bun. he offered to bring out another meal but i declined. just not worth the 11 bucks in my opinion. i used to come here quite a bit. well its time to find another bbq joint."}
{"text":"Ordered our food at 7:15 pm. Reminded the waiter for chips after 15 minutes. The waiter apologized then brought us a liittle cup of chip. After 30 minutes still no meal. Asked rhe waiter for the manager after 45 minutes. After 5 more minutes  the manager did not show up.  My wife and son had enough, we left. We will never go back to this place again."}
{"text":"Been here a few times with friends. This is a fantastic spot for pulled pork, barbeque, and ribs. It's priced pretty well and the service and quality has improved a lot since 2010. 

They are also good with the sauce varieties and bring out chips to get you going. Also appreciate the towels on the table for the messy eaters.

Keep it up !"}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times and had great service. The only thing I would recommend is that they get to our drinks a little sooner. Tonight I had waited almost 15 minutes until I got a refill. Other than that this location is great! Very friendly and great staff."}
{"text":"I must say that Famous Dave's has been going down hill when it comes to Customer service and quality of food...Had a bad experience today when their credit card machines were down...I waited more than 15 minutes for the waiter to run my card...Manager did not care about the service and did not correct the manual credit card receipt that had numbers totaling double my check total (written wrong)... The manager demanded that I sign the credit card receipt even though I asked the waiter to bring back a new manual credit card receipt showing the correct total...and even threatened to call the police if I didn't sign it and leave...Very bad customer relations... Should not be a manager...."}
{"text":"Famous Daves sauce is what it should be called cause the bbq isjust ok. The sauces are great, my fav is the devils spit and texas pit, but the Georgia mustard is really good as well. I will say the jalopeno and corn mac n cheese and the wilbur beans are delicious. The briskit was just ok. I feel it may have been sliced a while before I ordered it so it was a little dry. Thank good for that good ol sauce they got. The chicken was again just ok. Service was good and the decor is busy and lots to look at. Three stars cause that sauce is good!"}
{"text":"Service was great,  smiles.  Food was really good filing.  Clean and cool,  produce was fresh.  Homemade fries and bbq chips,  yum"}
{"text":"Get some Chippewa Indian barbeque....Minnesota style!  Famous Dave's started in Minnesota. I've been told that Dave is a Chippewa Indian...may sound a little odd...but he cooks up some very good barbeque!  Three restaurants have opened in Arizona in the past year or so.

Famous Dave's was a staple of my diet back when I was sufferin' in Minne-snow-ta. The chicken is OK, pulled pork and beef brisket better.
But what pulled me in were their St. Louis style ribs. Baby backs are good, but I just kind of dig spare ribs more. Don't know why...I just do. Famous Dave's does a pretty fair job with theirs.  Nice and meaty,  and grilled so that there's a little char on them. The meat falls off the bone just like it should. If I have any complaint with them it's that they slather it with their regular sauce. I really like their Texas Pit better. 

So if you're in the area, give them a try. Starting to get a little corporate, but don't let that stop you.  It's good solid \"Q\" that rivals most in the Valley. 

P.S. Skip the frozen corn as a side...ask for extra beans! :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ! What more can I say. The Brisket is very tender and flavorful. Chopped pork was superb. South side rib tips were great. Sauces and rub are on the spicy side but damn, this place a gem. Will definitely come back. 

Also, the service was great and you get a lot I food for the price. 5 star in my book"}
{"text":"Famous Dave's is a pretty decent place for some BBQ. I've tried a couple things on the menu and the one that tickles my fancy is the ultimate burger. Delicious juicy burger with some pig on top. I wouldn't change a thing on this meal-delish. They give you some chips to enjoy before your meal comes out and I really like those too. Try the sauces and make your own concoction. Sweet tea and bottled root beer go perfect with a little BBQ  they'd got a full bar too and plenty of tele's so if your not seeing what you wanna watch just ask and they'll change a channel. For those who don't like to eat in public they have a to go section on the east side of the joint."}
{"text":"We just enjoyed a very nice dinner. I ordered brisket and baby back ribs. The brisket was some of the best brisket I've ever had! Make sure if you want it moist, ask for fatty kind. Definitely good ribs and sides ( would be nice if portion size for the sides was larger ). The brisket is the stand out here without a doubt. It's the best I've had in Arizona!! All in all a good BBQ place."}
{"text":"My first time having burnt ends was great! went for lunch only downside you couldn't add burnt ends on 2 meat combo had to order as appetizer"}
{"text":"I gotta say that I had low expectations for Famous Dave's. It gives off a real chainy vibe. However, their barbecue is pretty decent. They also have a lot of sauces instead just the same old sugary ketchupy barbecue sauce at most places. Their corn bread is also tasty and addicting.

What i like about famous dave's is their all american platters. It's really fun to get some friends together and share a big plate of barbecue food.

However, I wasnt a fan of most of their sides. They weren't bad, but nothing really stood out."}
{"text":"Very good barbeque! My husband and I shared a full rack of the St. Louis style ribs. So, so much food! Really liked all of the different bbq sauces on the table to try. We had great service as well."}
{"text":"I lubz me some Famous Dave's.

I first visited one in Nebraska on a business trip about 7 years ago, we ate there about 7 times over 2 weeks. No joke.

I took a client out to lunch today, and he said, \"let's go to this BBQ place down the block.\"

You can imagine my pure joy when it turned out we were going to this palace of pork perfection. 
 
Their lunch combos are under $10 and huge. I had 2 tasty ribs, a giant bbq chicken breast with wing attached, corn, corn bread, and coleslaw. It was as good as I remember.

Devil's Spit sauce is the shit. Don't even mess with the others, homie. 

My only wish is that they had Diet Dr. Pepper. Seriously... If you aren't planning on getting totally plowed, you have to have Dr. Pepper with BBQ. Anything else is sacrilege.

4 not 5 because there is better BBQ out there. But not that I've had in AZ, unless I've made it myself."}
{"text":"I've gone here many a times and Famous Dave's never disappoints! Service is quick and the beers are good.

The beau and I usually split a rack of ribs and sides. Usually it's big enough so we're happily full and we still have leftovers for tomorrow's lunch.

Their sauces are like crack. My favorite is Devil's Spit. I even bought a bottle to take home. 

I recommend Famous Dave's any time you want a chill night out or some good ol' BBQ."}
{"text":"I love this place! Amazing food, awesome, fast and friendly service! They were so good even tho we came an hour before closing. Definitely the best:):) we ordered the feast for two and it was way more than enough, and we have healthy appetites!"}
{"text":"Just tried their to-go menu, oh my goodness!  Food was burnt. Requested a kid's meal chocolate milk, was given white milk poured out from somewhere into a styrofoam cup??? Wasn't sure how it was handled...don't think we'll go back any sooner."}
{"text":"This is a chain restaurant, and while I don't typically goto corporate type restaurants, I do like Famous Daves.  The food is actually really good.  The prices are fair and the service is always fairly decent. It is one of my favorite BBQ places in Mesa."}
{"text":"Got dinner for 2 to-go. St. Louis spareribs was delicious with devils spit sauce. They were kind of janky on the chicken that my boyfriend had. Im used to a big portion sizes from a BBQ places so was kind of disappointed especially when it was about $35 for 2 of us. But the meat wasn't dry like some places and the beans were good. I saved some sauce packets to use for other dishes!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Barbeque places in town. All the BBQ is great, along with a good selection of Barbeque sauces. The service is also descent, the manager actually walks the floor to check on everyone. We will definitely be back again.
Oh, and the strawberry shortcake is delicious. I do believe it's seasonal though, so get it while you can."}
{"text":"Although it's a bit of a drive for us to hit up this location, the food makes it all worth it! The staff here is very friendly regardless of whether you get seated in the bar area, or the main portion of the restaurant. 

We usually opt for the 2-meat lunch option where you get to pick from a variety of different BBQ meats. I went with BBQ chicken and spare ribs on our most recent visit. The lunches come with 1 side and a cornbread muffin. The cornbread is delicious. 

They have 5 or 6 different sauce options on the table, so everyone can get whatever flavor BBQ they like most. I go for the Sweet Zesty sauce. By the end of the meal we are usually so full we skip out on dessert, but the options are always enticing!

Overall: A
A good BBQ joint with good lunch deals (mmm cornbread)."}
{"text":"What a great Yelp find! Headed out here after having it bookmarked for a little while and we happened to be in the area, so it popped up on our search for local eats. We were fortunate enough to hit them while it was still lunch, so we were able to take advantage of their great lunch deals.

Decided on the 2 Meats Plate and went with ribs and BBQ chicken and opted for corn on the cob as my side. The meals came with cornbread as well! The ribs were cooked really well, and they were fall of the bone easy to eat. The chicken was tasty, but on the smaller portion size - but hey it was lunch and a lunch price, so really no big thing.

There were a variety of options for sauces on the table to top off the meat selections. From spicy to sweet to tangy, you really could find any kind of sauce you wanted. The cornbread was nicely done. The corn on the cob was the real winner for me for sides. It was sweet corn and cooked just right.

Our server was very friendly and came back regularly to check on us. We were stuffed, so we didn't get dessert this go-round, but it'll be on our check list for next time.

Overall: A
Another winning spot for Yelp bookmarks! When we are back in the area, we'll definitely stop on by!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here. We hadn't been here in a long time. Our meal was delicious. We both had the chose two meats and two sides. I had the saint Louis ribs (4), chopped pork, potato salad and fries, with a side of honey mustard for dipping my fries into. My husband had the chicken, catfish fillet, garlic mashed potatoes, coleslaw,. My ribs were very tender and almost an inch thick. I didn't care for the chopped pork, my husband liked it. I'll try the chicken next time. My husband said the chicken was very good. It wasn't that crowed. So it was nice. We will be back. 
Our waitress was Sarah. She was very friendly and smiled a lot. I asked for a glass of ice filled to the top and a glass of plain water and she brought them correctly. My husband wanted a glass of water with lots of ice and that was correct."}
{"text":"We had Erin as our server
Service was great 
Food and drink were also great 
They all treated my 3 year old 
We started with the burnt ends as an appetizer and brisket as the entree"}
{"text":"ask for FAMOUS SCOTT!!! He is such an awesome waiter!!! How cool is it that the second time I'm at Famous Dave's I got the same waiter? 

Just like I mentioned in previous review- I came again for the wings, skipped the beer this time.  The ribs were good and corn bread= to die for.  I had the pineapple wings, back backs, and St. Louis.  Delicious although the rack my friend had were a little burnt- but he said he'd return because the corn bread is so awesome (it was his first time there).  

My friends and I had a great time there tonight!  Thank you Famous Scott for being such a cool waiter.  I'm going to request him as my waiter every time I'm there now."}
{"text":"Second time at Famous Dave's and I think we've found a great BBQ place to come to! The ribs are fabulous! We enjoyed the rib tips and pork as well. The side of corn was overcooked, so we wouldn't order that again, but the rest of the food we had was great.

Service was good too - we sat in the booths in the bar area, and the waiters were alert, but not intrusive which was fabulous."}
{"text":"I hated BBQ my entire life (its un-american, I know). Seriously though. Couldn't stand the taste of burnt ketchup. My Birthday had come around and my genius boyfriend of 3 years opts to take me out to Famous Daves (and I thought he would be wasting his time and money). 

I gave the BBQ pork \"1 last go\" before I gave up on BBQ forever, and unbinoxed to me I LOVED IT!! 

Now I'm \"BBQ addicted\". We have gone at least 5x the last couple of months. 

They're so darn good I changed my life-long mind. How bout that? p:"}
{"text":"So disappointed.  Pulled pork was sooo dry had to drench in sauce to get it down.  Felt very pushed and rushed.  Won't go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Generally it is good, but it could be better. 
We came quite early and it was not packed yet. 
The service worths 5 star, welcome and friendly, offering free fries and introducing different tastes of sauce to us. we liked the devils' one best as it is a bit of spicy. 
We ordered the brisket with Mac Ron cheese and sweet corns, rib tips with mash potato and pineapple. 
The portion was quite generous ,  n they offered a muffin for each meal. Both the brisket n ribs were quite flavorful especially the ribs, grilling with several spices. 
However, I wish both can be tenderer, it was a bit dry for now, hard to chew, not as juicy n tender as what Rudy's bbq."}
{"text":"Food was ok. I ordered a salad. I guess I like more things in my salad and not just a bowl full of lettuce. That was disappointing.
Service was off too. The waitress couldn't remember who ordered what and reached across our faces a couple times instead of walking around the table."}
{"text":"In my search for great BBQ this place stands out.  Not only is it tasty but it doesn't irritate my stomach.  That is a major plus in my book.  The one drawback is service.  I've ordered online and arrived at the specified pick up time 30-60 minutes later to still have to wait another 15-20 minutes.  So be advised to just go to the take out counter and order, as it will take just as long."}
{"text":"g and i stopped in here for happy hour, and were shocked at how much we liked what we got. i was expecting the worst - i mean really? chain restaurant barbeque? and like i said, we were really surprised. we ordered happy hour specials - some sliders, some fries and wings. the food was good, and i loved the basket of different bbq sauces on the table. beers were cheap. our server was friendly and full of recommendations. the bill was super cheap - about $15. if we lived closer we'd probably be regulars."}
{"text":"our family of five ate here for my husbands birthday. everyone was satisfied with their meals, even my picky kids loved their food! our waiter was Cisco (i think that was his name). he was really friendly & i appreciated that he seemed very knowledgeable about the allergens in their food when i asked the question. my son has a serious nut allergy, and it's unfortunate that some restaurants don't know what's in their food. so overall we were really satisfied & the prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food. We always come here for a special occasion when there's a lot of people and always order their family style dinners for like 80 dollars and we always have left overs too!! Their servers are professional and very nice. They don't get mad or ticked off when asking them questions. The food is great as well, they always come out fresh and delicious every time."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in quite a few years. Remembering how good the ribs were I had 1/2 slab baby back ribs.  Apparently they don't trim off that membrane on the ribs...impossible to cut until we found the waitress and ask for sharp knives.  Had mac and cheese as one of my sides....ugh...it was sour.  Corn muffin good and fries OK.  Had a coupon for brunt ends appetizer and they were good.  For the most part it was like taking a match to a $20.00 bill.  Never again.  The background noise way too loud....guess some people call it music, but we like to chat during dinner....that made it difficult."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's has been one of the best BBQ restaurants I have eaten at in a long time. Their burnt ends are to die for! The only problem I had was that the restaurant was pretty loud but other than that the food was great and the service was great. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Famous Daves is the perfect place for some old fashioned comfort food. Is it a chain? Yup. Does that mean it's not delicious? Absolutely not! The parking lot is definitely a rarity downtown, and super nice, but the inside leaves a bit to be desired. It's clean enough, but a small space with no booths (where do I put my purse!?!?) and server stations are right by the tables. It feels like you should be able to get your own refills at the soda station but instead your server does it about a foot away from you. The service was efficient. He was not one for small talk, but we didn't wait for anything he was very on top of everything. Food is good, my mashed potatoes were only like warm but everything else was good as usual! Good place to go for some American BBQ and a cold beer (in a frosted glass!)"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat BBQ food.  With their 5 different BBQ sauces it's hard not to like this place.  Ranging from Texas pit, Georgia Mustard, Sweet & Zesty, Devils Spit, and original.   Everything is good here but this specific location when compared to the one in Sandusky/Cedar Point, the portion size is much smaller when it comes to fries/chips and beef brisket.  They recently took off the Corn and made it as a side item which is sad because it was always a free item before.   Their Chop Pork at this location is a bit salty and I probably won't order it again from this location but the ribs are good and the service is decent.    The Chicken is just ok and comparable to Boston Market.   

The bake beans here are some of the best i've ever tasted.   Fries/Chips are also a good side to choose.  The sampler has also changed where they uses to have salmon sticks, they now have corn fritters which I think was a good trade off because the salmon just wasn't very tasty and the corn fritters are good/ similar to corn hush puppies.The wings are pretty good but they only have a few flavors to choose from.  The garlic mash potatoes are what to be expected.   The pulled pork is pretty good from what I remembered but that was a while back.    

They do have the family feast (feeds 4-5) but it's $54 dollars and come with st louis full rack of ribs, beans, corn, corn muffins, full chicken, fries, and choice of brisket or pulled pork or chopped pork.  Honestly if you want that much chicken and a large portion of brisket or pulled pork then this is what you should order.  Otherwise I would suggest ordering two full slab entree's and a sampler which is about the same price, or two full slabs and a pick two meats combo.  which come to just about  the same price.     It does come with a fancy garbage lid and looks like a lot of food.  In the end it just depends what everyone wants.  If it's rib's then your better off just ordering two entree's. If half your group wants chicken then go for the feast.  Even with all the ribs we had for 5 people, we ordered a sampler(comes with 3 or 4 ribs) two full racks of ribs and a pick two meats.  We only had 3 ribs left over and everyone was satisfied."}
{"text":"I am an avid Famous Daves fan from Michigan so when visiting someone while in the Cleveland clinic I wanted to take his parents out for some good barbecue I took them to this Famous Daves and couldn't have been more disappointed we where seated right away order and drink order taken pretty quickly drinks delivered then all down hill from there ordered two appetizers one salad and one rib plate and for 50 minutes watched everyone else get served and we didn't even get drink refills at one hour we walked out with no food and me very embarrassed for suggesting the place. I might understand this on a busy Friday or Saturday night and even the thats pushing it. But a Tuesday night not to busy it was truly unacceptable."}
{"text":"famous dave's has always been really good.  i've been to the location in chandler and also in peoria and in both places, the service was good and the food comes  out QUICK.  i have my standard full rack of baby backs every time i go in.  i  love love love the variety of sauces.  they are all great and i can vary depending on my mood (although i usually like  to mix  the  devil's spit and the sweet and zesty).  the ribs are always fall-off the bone tender.  
on our last visit i finally decided to try something besides ribs (okay, i got the combo so i still got my baby backs) and i got the brisket.  i felt safe since i was getting the combo.  too many times i have had brisket that's just too tough or  drowned in sauce to cover up the dryness.  i was in for quite a treat.   the brisket was in nice thick strips and it  literally melted in my mouth.  i don't think i had to chew them at all.  
service was outstanding.  i like that even though it was busy and it's  super easy to turn tables easy i didn't feel rushed to get out."}
{"text":"Had this for the first time when it was catered for my niece's graduation party.  They had the shredded pork, riblets and chicken but I only tried the riblets and chicken and they were great! There isn't one close to my house or anything BBQ that is worth going to but I now drive out of my way on the weekends to have the Wilbur beans, cornbread, chicken wings and the strawberry lemonade! Love the Sweet and Tangy sauce!"}
{"text":"I used Famous Dave's to cater a party I threw once and everyone loved it.  Today we ate at the restaurant near the Peoria Sports Complex.  I ordered the fried cod with coleslaw and pineapple slab.  I really liked the fish.  It was moist, the breading was just right and flavorful, the coleslaw had good flavor, and the pineapple was super spicy.  My date ordered the burnt tips and ribs with broccoli and pineapple slab.  He loved the entire plate except that the pineapple lit him up too hot.  He can't handle much heat, ever.  He bit in before me, the official heat tester, and turned pretty red.  I love spicy, the hotter the better.  I think the menu should give a guy a warning on the pineapple just in case.  Both dinners came with a corn muffin and the waiter brought some bbq chips for the wait.  All in all, I wish there was a loose meat selection of bbq chicken or turkey, but besides that, it was very very good and we will be back.  Happy Hour had some cheap food/appetizer choices so that's a plus too."}
{"text":"My dad and I went here for lunch one day and sat on the patio. We asked the hostess if she could wipe down the table because there was barbecue sauce stuck all over it. She seemed less than thrilled and didn't even crack a smile even when my dad tried to make a joke. The salt and pepper shakers and sauce bottles were also extremely dirty and sticky. The server was also pretty serious the whole time and barely smiled but got friendlier as the meal went on. Despite the filth and mediocre attitudes, I'm giving this place for stars because the food is amazing. The server was good about refilling our drinks and coming to check on us, I will give them that! I ordered the lunch/pick 2: brisket and buffalo wings. The meat there is always outstanding, in my opinion. The brisket was very tender and I added my own barbecue sauce which gave it an extra zing. I have some of the best buffalo wings I've ever had. I like to get them on the bone because the meat tastes a lot more real and juicy than boneless. The mashed potatoes were very unflavorful and bland but that's ok, as long as you have salt nearby. I believe it was $9.99 for the lunch special: pick 2 meats and one side."}
{"text":"I have been to Famous Daves twice. The first time I went to San Tan with my family and it was wonderful. This time at the Chandler location (which I am only writing the review for) I could not have been more disappointed. I have worked at a restaurant when I was young and I know the frustration with people coming in late at night but this was out of line. 

My girlfriend and son came in this last Sunday at 845 (they close at 10). There was immediate tension and annoyance shown by the staff when I asked for the television channel to be changed to watch March Madness. I wasn't trying to be rude at all only asking twice, but there was 5 minutes left and I didn't want to miss it ! Well the staff struggles to figure it out as I watched everyone looking so confused about to how to get that done. Either way I got to watch the last 45 seconds so there's the one star this review got. The food was very good our last visit so we were very excited to eat so that wasn't going to ruin anything ! We ordered the family platter ( feast for two ) that serves 2-3. Extra side of Mac and cheese because I remembered how good it was from the first visit, and two waters and one iced tea. The food came out in less than 15 minutes which was great ! Maybe too fast now that I think about it. We ate and enjoyed our meal, stayed till 945 and tried to leave so that we weren't trying to just lounge around till close. We even took home plenty of leftovers. 

Later that night at 1am, I had a family in crisis fighting over the two bathrooms in our house. All of us vomiting and having to use the restroom till we were restless. This had finally ended late last night. (This was also the first time we had all eaten together, my girlfriend works nights so she had just woken up and this was her first meal of the day.) Therefore, there food was the source. We called yesterday to alert them of the issue (not asking for compensation never would do anything like that) for the sake of other late night eaters that may go through the same thing. They told us a manager would call because only supervisor Paige was there and she could not handle the issue. No response that day. Called again and Paige said she must have wrote the phone number down wrong because she had called us and there was no response. Really ? Well that's when I knew I needed to write a review. Welp, that 50 dollar meal and 10 dollar tip was a waste, even threw the leftovers away because there is no way I could go through an experience like that ever again ! Just a warning, if you feel like the staff is pushing you out the door and half doing their job (maybe not even capable of doing it) beware your food may not be cooked correctly just because employees want to start cleaning before the place is closed. So Instead of me telling the manager, I have decided to write a review for all of you to know how my experience was. Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. I loved the  BBQ sauce on my chicken. I ordered mac and cheese as a side and it was as expected."}
{"text":"My family is a huge fan of BBQ, especially ribs, so this North Olmsted restaurant was a definite must try. 

I always try to start positive. 
I love the fact that they have not one, nor two, not three even! But 6 BBQ flavors on every table. Coming from a girl who would put BBQ on eggs, potatoes, hell even I steak and potato soup, this is awesome. 

Onto the food: The burnt rib tips were at least 50% fat. The brisket tasted like wet roast beef. The sides were decent. If you like KFC you'll be a fan. (I don't) 

I can't give a negative review however, because what we did get to consume was tasty and it is pretty decently priced. Two dinners were only $30 total."}
{"text":"The food is good however the service is terrible. We arrived and they told us it was going to be a 10-15 min wait, however the host was telling everyone this and we ending up waiting 35 minutes. Then when we go to our table finally,  we ended up waiting again another 15 minutes to be greeted by the server. It took her 10 minutes to bring out the chips they serve for the sauces and then again we continued to wait for our food. The food then arrived and  no one came around to check on us until we finished our food, then again we waited for her to take our card but instead we just decided to leave cash. We were there a total of 2 hours which is ridiculous seeing how we are fast eaters. The restaurant was not that busy, there were plenty of servers on shift, so this should not have happened. If you are in a hurry do not some to this location."}
{"text":"Great place and nice service. I forgot the drink's name, but it tastes great! Shrines something...maybe....... The traditional wings with sassy sauce.... Wanna eat again, haha"}
{"text":"Went for lunch started out slow, poor started get really busy. Food runner brought fries, ice cold sent back with different food runner. Took off bill. Food came fries with food again  ice cold. Sever finally made it right. Manger finally came over. But rest food was fabulous. I will be back, bad day for server, food runner need to double check the food."}
{"text":"We used to go here a lot...until they took the smoked ham off their menu!!! The waitress told us that not many people liked it, but every time I was there, people were eating it. The smoked ham was our family's favorite, so we haven't been back since- bring back the ham!!!"}
{"text":"As you're aware it's a chain.  Occasionally the bbq can be a bit dry, but it's easily made up with the various sauces.   

They have a good variety of sauces to appease a wide variety of people.   

I recommend hitting the place for lunch.   The you pick 2 meats deal is very reasonable.   

My hint would be if you're debating an early or late lunch, go later.  If you are early sometimes you get meat from the night before.   Later it seems to be fresher."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there last night and I had their new barbecue Bourbon barbecue sauce, 
But I believe that Sauce has a Lotta MSG because the reaction I had was headache, nausea, fast pulse, sweats which i am pretty sure that new bourbon sauce was Loaded with MSG!!
Dont think i will be back!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Cedar plank salmon had to send it back because it was almost raw.  They took it back to put on the grill, when it was returned my side dishes were cold."}
{"text":"Ribs came out cold and when I said something they took them back and reheated them in a microwave making them scalding hot. The ribs were then overcooked and not good at all. We had a great server however the food was not good and we wont be back."}
{"text":"Hungry after a road trip so figured I could do worse than FD's. Cold beer and respectable brisket sandwich. Interesting sauce selection on the table as well. Pretty busy on Saturday afternoon but the staff handled the rush well. No serious complaints except I wish I'd been in Kansas City for lunch!"}
{"text":"I give this Famous Dave's 3 stars because the one nearest to where I live is better.

It had been a while since I'd visited a Famous Dave's.  My daughter and her family live in Mesa and I had encouraged them to give FD's a try since it wasn't too expensive.  They had a great experience at this one as first time visitors.  The manager  gave them a coupon for free chicken wings for their next visit plus a free bottle of BBQ sauce.  That, I must admit, was very nice as the one closest to me doesn't care if you are a first-timer or not.

I had forgotten just how much food ends up on your plate---way too much!   Yet one thing I do like about Famous Dave's --- they allow you to create your own combos.  I like the BBQ chicken and catfish combo.  At this Famous Dave's,  the BBQ chicken was moist but disappointingly was bland in flavor.  The catfish was spicy but dried out.  As always, the corn muffins, though on the sweet side, are moist and tasty.  The corn-on-the-cob was juicy and properly cooked.  I had  the mac and cheese.  It's good but I  think it could do without the corn in it.    My husband does like Wilbur's beans but he thinks the brisket is *meh*.

For chain BBQ, I guess Dave's isn't bad.  However, if you've  had BBQ in a highly rated non-chain place, Dave's will pale in comparison.

Still...service tends to be good, attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Two visits, two satisfied dinners.  The St Louis ribs taste great as served, but adding a different sauce to each rib is even better.  The brisket as well.  The sweet corn on the cob is nice & juicy.  The corn bread is sweet, buttery, and you don't get the surprise kernel of corn in each bite. (I prefer my corn bread kernel-less, thank you!)  The Wilbur Beans have a great zing and a surprisingly large ratio of meat for the small portion you get.   And The Alligator is a great signature cocktail.  

I really need to try something else next time. I have a bad habit of finding one dish that I love at a restaurant early and never trying anything else. Because I don't want to be disappointed, knowing I would've loved the other thing.  The good news is I'll definately have that bridge to cross, because I will be back!"}
{"text":"We used to love to go sit on the bar and watch a base ball game, and get the happy hour special, not anymore.  The new happy hour menu doesn't have much to choose from. We ordered the hot links and rib tips. Both came with French fries that we were not aware of.  The hot links was one split in half, was luke warm and greasy. The rib tips were not that great, not very meaty. The fries were cold.  We like thier ribs and chicken wings but no more on happy hour menu.  They kept changing the tv's while we were watching. One time while the bases were loaded!  The manager was talking to all the employees but not the customers.  Used to be one of our favorite places to catch a game and get some good food too, but no longer."}
{"text":"Had a great meal there on my birthday and the rib tips were great.
Cant get enough of their chips and sauces not to mention their spicy pickle chips.
James G is a great bartender and took great care of us. 
Thanks for the blow torch atop my birthday sundae !!
Famous daves bbq leftovers are great the next day !!"}
{"text":"a friend and i split a St. Louis Rib-N-Meat BBQ Combo with ribs and brisket for lunch; green beans, fries, cornbread, etc.  for $16.  two hungry guys barely finished it - the ribs are just perfect and the brisket is tender and juicy.  one word review = Yummy."}
{"text":"Very good food. Bar b cue and cornbread are excellent. Very good customer service and I've never had a problem with the food."}
{"text":"Being from Texas i was skeptical on ordering from here. But i ended up getting the hot sausage link dinner with Mac and cheese and side salad! It was sooo good and worry the price! The corn muffin was DELICIOUS! I have been back again for he side salad because it was also that good! I will be back faster exploring the menu i know what i will try next!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ in the Santan Village mall. A really nice shopping mall with a uniquely different layout. 
This place was very nicely decorated with different types of BBQ themed signs and banners. They even have a small sports bar type area. Outside seating was available weather permitting. 
We had the Sassy Barbecue salad and The feast for one. The salad was really big with a lot of brisket and a really tasty dressing.  
There was so much food with the individual feast, we had leftovers for lunch or dinner the next day. Bab back ribs barbeque  chicken pull pork coleslaw baked beans corn on the cob and corn bread and potato wedges. The meats were so tender and full of flavor. You could also try some of the other BBQ sauces that were in the table. 
I had one oh the specialty cocktails. Mamma's pounce was really refreshing and tasty. It was like a tropical drink. 
No room for dessert."}
{"text":"I heard this place was really good. we had a large party. our server \"cisco\" was all over the place, took a long time for anything, messed up our order pretty bad and seemed to be first day on the job as he couldn't answer questions about entree's (all he said was \"it''s really good\"). Then there was some bigger guy with balding hair and i'm pretty sure he was a manager. This guy was helping running food out to our large party and i saw him from about 10 feet away kind of arguing with my 13 y/o son. my son had ordered mac n cheese with fries and this guy brought him mac n cheese with a pineapple slice. my son said he didn't like the pineapple and wanted the fries. i saw this big guy give my son a dirty look and said \"just take this one\" and set it down and walked away. right there is stood up and approached the guy and asked if everything was ok over there and he said \"yea it's all good, the kid is bugging me for fries but he can have the pineapple\". BUGGING YOU FOR FRIES??? isn't this a restaurant? I always thought in a restaurant you order what food you want off the menu and get it.....not take what the drop in front of you. come to find out, this plate of mac with a pineapple was another kid at the other end of the table. if this big guy would have just politely asked, then all of this would have been avoided. Soon after that one of  the parents were going to the restroom (right by the kitchen) and overheard this same big balding manager talking to some servers claiming how difficult our party was and couldn't wait for us to leave. Is that what a manager should think about a group of around 40 people? I would think that a group that large would bring in some nice money for the restaurant and that a manager would be happy and not complain about his guests like that (or at least where he could be heard). to top it off a few people (about 9) got sick from the food. not sure what they ate, but i had the BBQ chicken sandwich and it was OK. OK meaning i didn't get sick and the taste was average. to sum up this review, it was my first ever experience at a famous Dave's BBQ and will most likely be the last, at least at this location. As for that big manager, maybe you should go work as a dishwasher, that way you can complain all you want to the dirty dishes and your guests will not have to experience you poor attitude."}
{"text":"Went here to eat dinner...i got the cast iron steak....it was burnt full of char...have to drench in bbq for any flavor. I know its a bbq place but wanted just a steak. My wife got the catfish. Little slivers of catfish strips that were a lil too fishy for her. Best thing was the side but that being said u get a small scoop of those! We wont be going back due to the food....the time it took the server to get our food. I think they were a lil understaffed"}
{"text":"Overall the food was good, portion sizes were generous when we visited on 5/27. A little disappointed they ran out of house-made chips. We received a tiny bowl for five people to try the different sauces (it was the first time visiting for myself and two others so we were eager to try the sauces!) Our server said she would bring more but never did."}
{"text":"Love it! Always great service,  and even better food. I would highly suggest the burnt ends!"}
{"text":"Great service. Their food is delicious. I recommend the nachos with the beef brisket"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile , apperantly over a year because they stopped serving the Salmon spread WTH , anyway staff very friendly , we sat on patio and was not forgotten about at all, we had the feast for 2 which easily could serve 4 but was excellent especially the ribs , you could taste the smoke in them which is how they should be , I would say they upped there game and doing a good job , from other reviews it seems like either 1 or 2 staff members need to be talked to then again there are a lot of picky , whining people out , will be back"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Famous Daves for the first time, it was fantastic,  Great food, great service, we highly recommend,"}
{"text":"mmmmmmmmmeat!

When I'm in the mood to pig out, and don't want to drive all the way to Bobby Q, I head to Famous Dave's. You get a lot of BBQ bang for your buck at this place. I don't think I've ever left there without leftovers.

This weekend the boyfriend and I decided we were craving some good all-american pig out food so we headed over to FDs to get our glutton on. I ordered the brisket meal and he ordered the chicken wings. Each platter comes with two sides (and corn and cornbread - told you you'd be pigging out) so I chose the mac and cheese and the fries. They changed their mac and cheese recently and I have to admit I wasn't that thrilled with it. It used to be standard, old-school mac and cheese. Now it has corn and jalapenos in it. It was okay but I like the simple stuff with BBQ. The rest of the food was great. I tried the Dr. Pepper glaze on the brisket which was good, not too sweet.

We had a really nice server and the whole experience was just easy and fast - which is just what you want on a Friday night after a long, busy work week.

We left there stuffed, satisfied and with a box full of leftovers for later. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"For a chain, Famous Dave's is pretty good. I'm so anti chain that i would never have gone here..... but we needed something close, and we wanted to terrorize my friend's son who was there working there at the time. There is joy in teasing teenage children, even if they aren't your own... so I went. 

They serve meat, meat and more meat.... with some potatoes and a hunk of corn. Seriously... you get a trashcan lid full of brisket, ribs, chicken parts and a couple of sides... I like the cole slaw and the french fries, but i have heard that they have great mashed potatoes. 

Prices are cheap for the quantity, and the quality is good. I've been there 3 times now and i always end up taking some home.. For a chain, this place is pretty good."}
{"text":"Sure the idea of bbq from a chain restaurant is a turn-off but Famous Dave's really is a good place.  The ribs are good the sauce is good, the brisket is good. $3 margaritas every day.  Tonight our ribs were just a little tough and our server could have done a touch better, but we are fans and always like our dinner here."}
{"text":"I usually love famous Dave's but this visit wasn't the best. We got there and had a party of 4 and a high chair. Took forever to get us seated, we saw a couple parties come in after us get seats before us when we looked annoyed they finally sat us. We had to wait a while and finally we had to let them know we're ready for to order. And as we waited we were the ones to ask for the chips appetizer. So we noticed everyone was getting food before us who came after us. We asked about why we had to wait so long because it's unusual we wait that long and the waiter didn't answer us he just said ok and walked away and called the GM who then just said well burgers take a while and he will look at the videos to see what time we ordered. We're not picky people but was just annoyed with the wait time to sit, to be asked to ordered and then for our food. It's not fun watching everyone who came in after you get food before you."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for St Louis style ribs. They have awsome corn bread too.
On holidays they sell smoked turkeys that 
are the best I've ever had. Comfortable atmosphere with big wash sink in dinning room. Fast, attentive service. You can call in an order for pick up as well. Highly recommend you try this place."}
{"text":"Always have the feast for 2 it means we bring home leftovers  and who doesn't like leftovers.  No matter when we go we have an excellent server! Kudos to whomever does the hiring"}
{"text":"I love BBQ and try to hit a restaurant in any city I visit, especially the south. For a chain restaurant,  Famous Dave's isn't bad. It's not great but isn't not terrible either.
This location was very loud and the food was slow. About 45 minutes from when we ordered until the food arrived.
The food was about 3 stars. I like good char, which this definitely lacked. Flavor was mild and the meats were dry. I prefer when you don't need to add sauce, their's definately needed it to both add flavor and moisture.
You may wonder why I gave them 4 stars... our service was excellent. I wish I could remember his name (I think it was Nate). He was prompt, friendly, and attentive,  even on a busy night. Always made sure we had what we needed and drinks were full. He was great with our kids, which for me, as a dad, is always a big deal. I would give him 5 stars, which is why I averaged the visit at 4."}
{"text":"Stopped on for lunch on Sunday, we were greeted promptly and seated right away. The place was moderately busy. Our waitress came shortly after we were seated, she introduced herself and the trainee she had with her, and took out drink orders. I set out looking at the menu full of BBQ yumminess.
I ended up ordering off the lunch menu, and chose the special of 1 meat, and one side. I chose the BBQ rib tips and fries. It wasn't long after our order was placed that the meal came out. I have to say the ribs were yummy. A little too fatty for my liking, but good nonetheless. The fries were food as well. It came with their signature sweet and spicy pickles. Yum! 
The decor is country rock and roll modern. 
The restaurant is located in a shopping plaza, and depending on when you go, the parking can be a nightmare. But don't worry, you can walk yourself out of your BBQ coma going back to your car."}
{"text":"I have 3 favorite BBQ places and this is my go to #1 . The Brisket is always on point , ribs fall off the bone & the grilled pineapple is sweet/spicy and incredibly juicy . I keep trying to duplicate the grilled pineapple at home and I just can't touch it . The kids meals are a killer deal at $5.99 , And they include a drink. As far as family meals out go this place is always an affordable treat . On a side note, we had famous daves catered at work for thanksgiving last year . The smoked turkey was so moist and smoky but a tinge of sweet. Honestly, the best I've ever had . I need to see if I can order some for this coming thanksgiving. Talk about a showstopper for the holidays ."}
{"text":"Famous Daves in San Tan
After 3 visits and a broad sampling of what they have to offer, I feel I can review this place with objectivity.
It is expensive  for what you actually get and the formula seems to weigh in favor of fats and sugars to keep you blindly returning for more.

Looking around the room while dining in one can see this hypothesis brought to bare on the wide girth of the patrons stumbling in.

They start you out with home made potato chips in a sweet BBQ sauce. 
The lunch portions are quite small.   For $8.29 my husband got a very small piece of chicken and a small scoop of mash potatoes with a small corn muffin. 

Does anyone need all these carbs?

On another visit he had the double \"portion\" of meats ($9.59) 
This came with a very small piece of chicken with a small hot link in a piece of bread, again the small side dish and muffin. 

Clever sayings on the backs of the t-shirt uniforms reveal the sentiments of Famous Daves aptly. 
One says      \" because you don't win friends with salad\"  

I suppose that anyone could choose some better side dishes but the problem with this is that the only way they know to make anything appeal to the palette is with butter salt or BBQ sauce. I had my side dishes sans butter and the lack of culinary skills at Famous Daves was supremely evident.

So if you are brave enough to taste the food here without its disguises ( Butter and or BBQ sauce) the awareness will dawn on you....not good food here...not good food at all.
True, it is a BBQ joint, but the quality is simply not there.
( butter, salt and BBQ sauce...the trilogy of culinary camouflage.)"}
{"text":"When it was lunch time there was only one place we wanted to try out and that's Famous Dave's BBQ. The lunch special was recommended by our very attractive waitress. The  fried catfish lunch meal was just what the doctor ordered. Now since we are from GA. the sweet tea was pretty tastey I so might say."}
{"text":"Went to Dave's last night for dinner. They were very busy with a couple of parties so our wait was longer then normal. When we finally got our food, the manager came over to apologize and actually picked up the tab. I was totally taken by surprise. I thought customer service went away long ago but not at Dave's BBQ. It will now be a regular stop on our restaurant list. Thanks for the exceptional service and the great food."}
{"text":"Stopped by the other evening to grab some BBQ. The service provided by Darryl was awesome. He made sure we had everything we needed and checked in on a regular basis. The food was so good , I had to take some home. It was a Saturday and plenty of room for seating. I would recommend this place as a favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"Got the family platter for me wife and three kids. Was plenty of food. Loved he corn brisket was good he chicken and ribs were not on same level. The price was good and we took some home."}
{"text":"The food is a bit pricey, but good quality.  I love their homemade chips.  I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's has been on the decline for awhile now, and my last visit was the final nail in the coffin. 

First and foremost, the food that was formerly decent is now nearly inedible. A few years ago I could rely on FD's to give me a nice lean, thick-cut portion of brisket that wasn't mind-blowing, but had a good flavor and texture and a nice dark color from the smoke and bark. On a recent Saturday afternoon, I was served a couple thin slices of wet, gray meat. It was so fatty and limp that it was ridiculous; the meat fibers were literally individually popping out of a web of fat. Barf. I don't have trypophobia, but picturing this still gives me the chills. 

The Wilbur beans were okay, but the mashed potatoes had very little flavor - definitely none of the butter or garlic promised in the description. The flavor of the cornbread was fine, but it was so dry that half the muffin was left stuck to the wrapper in chunks of crumb. 

If a server had ever bothered to return to our table after dropping off food, I would have sent it back. After sitting alone with my family in the dining room with no server in sight I gave in and finished the sides and cornbread. My boyfriend isn't picky about food, so I got a box and gave him my leftover brisket. Even though he is generally a human garbage disposal (said with love, he just isn't a picky dude), even my boyfriend couldn't bring himself to eat it. 

I do like their sauces, and we did have great service from one young man  earlier this year. However, aside from that one guy who was actually engaged, the other couple of visits we've made over the last year or so have left a lot to be desired. On one visit I was served the wrong side and when I told the server he picked it up off my plate and walked away instead of just bringing the correct thing. In general, servers have come to take orders, drop off food, and then drop off a check - no drop-ins for drink refills or to make sure everything is okay unless you can find them and flag them down. 

The three-strike combo of low-quality food, inattentive service, and high prices has me saying bye-bye to Famous Dave's and hello to exploring better BBQ places around town."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and great service! We were a big party and first time there visiting from CA and the waitress was so sweet and helpful, I had the 1/2 slab and boy was it delicious! Next time we r in town visiting we will definitely stop by again"}
{"text":"Yuck pulled pork is ok but brisket is well not sure you can even call it brisket. Touch chewy sliver slices. So sad. Be sure to look at the picture. That is really what they served me!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ last night! Keep in mind portions are pretty big, so come with an appetite. Only concern was the service was a little slow (not bad tho) the food made up for it. I definitely recommend it if you don't have your own smoker and 12-14 hours to spend cooking."}
{"text":"Love this place. Anytime I have a craving for bbq food, I want to go here. We went a couple of weeks ago and had the best service and food. We got there right when they opened at 11 and that must be the best time to go, because everything was so fresh and there was practically no one there yet.They must have put all the meat on the smoker that morning because it tasted like it was just done cooking. Our waitress was extremely nice and was constantly checking in on us. The ribs are so good and have a lot of meat on them. They have a wide variety of sauce to choose from and each one is very tasty! I'll definetly be going back!"}
{"text":"I had eaten here before and I thought I remembered liking it.  Tonight I got the brisket.  It came out almost all fat.  And the waitress was awesome in noticing that I wasn't happy and offered to bring me a lean serving.  Both tasted kind of bland.  I have to say it ranked with the worst BBQ I have had.  I really liked the corn bread and the potato salad. My other complaint is the diet pepsi tasted like soda water."}
{"text":"Every time we visit Famous Daves we are never disappointed! Always get right in, always the BEST food and wonderful friendly service! My kids beg to go there and having 3 picky boys its nice to know they will always eat their food, nothing is ever wasted! The pickles are amazing!! I buy a jar every time because I cant get enough!! LOVE THIS PLACE!!"}
{"text":"Hmmm...This place is pretty much just average, nothing special. Got the wing basket and a beer. Service was alright...waitress was so busy hanging out chatting with the male bartenders took her sometime to come over. Food was good and came out fast for a Saturday night!"}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ way better then Rudys. The Mac and cheese and ribs are awesome. Good size portions and great for the family. Staff is nice, place is clean and limited wait times."}
{"text":"I have been here three times.It is located outside of River walk shopping center and down the street from the Cubs field.  I have tried a few of their options. And I think the reason Dave's is Famous, is because they are good. The Mesa location is great. We always sit at the bar with ROCK STAR bartenders. ( Cole is great). They remember your face drink and treat you like gold. Place is clean. This past week I tried the hot wings. they were NOT Buffalo wings, they were smoky. But they were good. I will warn you NOT to get the hottest sauce. It hurts. For days. The rib dinners are good, They offer the smoky style and the saucy style. Burnt ends are a smoky treat and really great with beer. Shoestring onion rings awesome, coleslaw is my fave,  Anyhow, go here, Say hi to the bartenders and tell them they are legends. because they make good recommendations and will keep you entertained while you watch games on the numerous TVs above the bar. Try the wings, too, And GREAT Happy Hour prices..."}
{"text":"Yummy! I've now eaten here twice in the past month. Both times the good was delicious. I ordered chicken BBQ sandwich Memphis style with a side a Mac n cheese."}
{"text":"This review has nothing to do with the food. We have eaten at Famous Dave's in the past and was very pleased. However, we stopped by for lunch and had our dog with us. I politely asked the Hostess if the patio was dog friendly for a well trained dog. She asked the bartender who said no....only Service Dogs. The patio is huge and no one was out there. I think this is the first patio at a restaurant that we have been denied and IS NOT DOG FRIENDLY. For that, Famous Dave's, you get 1 star. Red Robin across the street gladly accommodated us."}
{"text":"Every time I visit famous Dave's I try and get something different and I'm not disappointed. You will not leave this place not full even the more smaller plates are stacked high. 

When place opened my wife and I were walking by with our kids and it was the pre-opening. It was VIP day and the manager asked if we were hungry and to come on it, the food is free today.  

I've been back about 4 other times since February and the manager comes by to talk because I used to be a cook and in the food service. All the side dishes are really great, my daughter decided that the corn bread on her plate was not enough. She helped herself to my plate finished my cornbread too and then moved onto the rib tips. 20 mins after that she was asleep in the chair and slept all the way home and throughout the night. 

The beer selection could be better, I'd like to see some more micro-brews but I feel this way from drinking beer at San Tan Brew in chandler."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner  , seated fast our server was Vickie she was very attentive and very nice , took our drink order and didn't have to wait too long we ordered the dinner feast for two and it was great! It can easily feed 4 so we had plenty of left overs... I would definitely come here again next time we are in town! ."}
{"text":"The kids had fun with all the sauces, it did seem pricey but everything was amazing. EVEN THE GREEN BEANS, I dont say that often.  Clean plates all around, can't wait to talk  the husband into trying it with us so I can adventure into their menu!"}
{"text":"Great food here:  the Ultimate Burger which we got just for signing up as a member here so it was free and bought 1/2 slab ribs (the country rib type that has more meat).  Just fantastic!
The waitress even brought some of those homemade chips over so we could try their 5 types of sauces before the food came which was appreciated. We liked the Mustard sauce so well we bought a bottle.
The sides were good, too:  mac/cheese, potato salad and cole slaw.  The cornbread they serve with the ribs...again, excellent.
I can honestly say we didn't have one complaint about the food:  all expertly prepared and just wonderful!
As for the waitress, she was tops!  She even gave us big cups with lids, straws and a lemon for me (I drink water) when we left.  She gave us such fantastic service we left a 30% tip!  That should tell you something.
Will we go back?  You bet your sweet ribs we will...I LOVE this place!!!"}
{"text":"For a second time this month, Famous Dave's sure does satisfy the appetite. 
I started off with fried pickles as my appetizer, they were so good! I like them because there're sliced and not spears. 
Our waiter did a presentation with the famous sauces. Famous Phil B displayed a pig  it was very entertaining  the portions are very filling. My favorite sauce is the \"rich and sassy!\" 
We had plan to catch a movie after and the service was fast, we were early for the movie! 
I would recommend this place for family or a fun date dinner!"}
{"text":"Like Famous Daves since I first dined at one in Utah.
They don't fill you up with peanuts or bread, just yummy, slow cooked bbq.
Came here on this evening to take advantage of the birthday deal they send you when you sign up on their page.  
I like the St. Louis Ribs cause they're meatier and jucier than the Baby Back Ribs.  
Gimme some of that Devil Spit sauce and things are all good."}
{"text":"Excited for BBQ on a Friday night? Well don't waste your time going here unless u want to spend the next 24 hours throwing up! Ordered the Texas beef brisket sandwich, fries and a side of ranch sounded so yummy until 2am Friday night when I threw it all back up. I have 2 small kids and do u know what that means when momma gets food poisoning? It means all hell is about to break loose. All I can say is Thank Goodness my husband was home to take over or I would have been screwed. Thanks for ruining the weekend."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised. Don't get me wrong-- this place's flavor profile is almost entirely made up of butter, but you probably knew that if you're considering a chain barbecue joint to go eat aren't you? The tenders, ribs, chicken are all great. They offer a variety of different barbecue sauces depending on your palate for sweetness and for spice. The corn muffins are sweet and moist, which makes them easily delicious. Wait staff is attentive. Good spot. That being said, my good experience probably cost on the order of 3500 calories, so just know thats whats happening."}
{"text":"Happy hour at Famous Dave's...dead fly in my Moose Drool...little bastard floating under the head ended up in my MOUTH...@&$$==)(#
Where is John Tapper? The resolution by the bar tender and manager...\"want another beer?\"...Nasty!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and left SO full! Huge portions so you get your money's worth. Fried pickles are great and their corn bread is the best I've ever had. Their bbq sauce is a household staple at our house (available in stores) so its nice to be able to come here and get what we like. They forgot my birthday after my husband told the waiter but it didnt matter cause I was FULLLL! We will be back!"}
{"text":"My work gets the lunch boxes catered but I can't eat the mac and cheese or beans because there spicy.  I figured there would be non spicy options there, there isn't.  Our waitress was a little odd and seemed overwhelmed but was nice explained the sauces to us. I felt like the chips were salty as in over salty.  My lunch date loved the spicy pickles I was happy they had regular ones. We tried the rib tips to start but I thought they were over powered with pepper"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, not sure what is up with the servers here. Seem very inattentive. Different one each time too. Weird.

Anyway, great beer, cheap beer, great happy hour. That's the only reason I go."}
{"text":"So, while I'm not really a fan of chains or anything, I have to give Famous Dave's props for making what was turning out to be a birthday outing disaster a pretty damn good success! 

The evening was supposed to start out with a trip to BW3s in Mesa (Buffalo Wild Wings for you non midwesterners). However, due to a special event we had to make a last minute decision to head to Famous Daves. At first we were told there would be an hour wait, which was sad. No more than 5 minutes after we seated ourselves at the bar though, our table was ready!! Success!!

Our server was pretty polite and I appreciated his razzing me for only having water (I had already downed 10 cocktails earlier that day) and was very good with taking our orders and the quirky ways we wanted to change things. Our food came out fast and prompt and everyone seemed very pleased with the change in venue. 

Some things that put them above being a typical barbecue chain?

** At one point someone at the table was telling a story and the pig decided to sit down at the fireplace behind her and imitate her for about 5 minutes before she noticed. It was HILAROUS. You creeped me out at first pig, but I heart you now.

** Dynamite looking sparklers on free birthday treats??? ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. We were all jealous of that dessert. 

What started off as a tragedy was saved by Famous Daves. I was unable to eat my food that night as I wasn't feeling well, but I can tell you that it's pretty good reheated the next day. Yay for the mac and cheese side dish!!"}
{"text":"Had the rib tips and Georgia style chopped pork, and it was probably the most amazing BBQ meal I have had in a Looooong time.  I am a fan - a huge fan of daves even more now.  Fall of the bone goodness, and amazing sides.   They took care of us - and there was 9 of us, and we all had full drinks, and never had a want.  Worth the money spent, and will go back to this location soon."}
{"text":"Good food and service again.  I just love everything at Famous Daves.   I enjoyed it with my brother in law, wife and brother and they all said their food was fantastic as well.

Beef - nice smokey flavor but not to powerful, and the pulled pork was just amazing and juicy .... This location seems to have things down pat and I would recommend anyone go here.  Why no 5 stars still?  IMO its just not as good as some other BBQ places that are 5 star worthy, but don't let that stop ya from going to Daves...its amazing."}
{"text":"So glad a Famous Dave's opening up near me.  I have been waiting for this one for a while.  I blame going here on Man vs Food where he was taking on some BBQ from Texas.  Anyway, I had the beef brisket & Chopped Pork.  They bring it with Corn on the Cob & Cornbread.  My two sides (as if al that were not enough) were the baked beans and garlic mashed potatoes.  Really good meal, but word of advice - if a kid is scared of the dude (or gal) in the pig suit, leave them alone - they are scared of you and Daddy just may get up and punch you in the snout if you make his kid scream one more time.  Just my .02 though.

I can't wait to continue to go here and enjoy being a \"meatavor\"  Service was great and prices are always reasonable.  Portions are more than enough and again, my only complaint is the annoying person in the pig suit making my kid scream.  It may be fun for YOU, but not ME!"}
{"text":"My brother in laws 50th birthday with 26 people- was there and on time for the set up - great service and the food was awesome . Highly recommend the sausage, chopped pork spicy Mac and cheese. I will highly recommend famous Dave's - keep kicking ass!"}
{"text":"Went it today at lunch time.
I had 1/2 rack of Ribs, Beans & Coleslaw.
I got my food quick and everything tasted very good. 
Cammy was the Bartender/Server she was Smiley and very friendly.
I give her and Dave's 2 Thumbs up if I had 4 thumbs I would give her more.
I will go back again Great Job Cammy!!!"}
{"text":"I went here on New Year's Day which also happened to be a Saturday night so needless to say it was pretty busy when I walked in.  Luckily they were able to get us seated fairly quickly which was surprising.  Unfortunately our seats were at one of those long benches that has multiple tables spaced out along it.  So right away I was a little unhappy just because I value my personal space and don't particularly enjoy sitting elbow to elbow with the stranger sitting at the table next to me.

The waitress was friendly and came by right away to get our drink orders.  She came back with them pretty fast and then took our meal order.  We didn't have to wait long for that either as that came out quicker than expected too.  The food was good as expected since I've been to Famous Dave's before (I would go just for their corn bread!).  I'll definately be going back just probably not on a Saturday night which also happens to be a holiday...."}
{"text":"Before I started Yelping here in Madison, we lived for 13 years in the Twin Cities, the adopted hometown of Famous Dave Anderson, where he turned his original, Hayward, Wis., BBQ joint into a multi-state chain. We have been to Famous Dave's dozens of times in close to a dozen locations. Their quality is very consistent -- solid, not spectacular, although their portion sizes have shrunk over the years. We'll be back to Famous Dave's many more times, I'm sure. For now, I'm just going to letter grade all the menu items I remember trying: 

Brisket: A-. Some of the best I've had. Nice smoke ring, tender, deep flavor. The minus is for the small portions and occasional grisly days. Use the Texas Pit sauce.

Pulled pork: B+. I'm not a huge pulled pork fan but theirs is pretty good. I like it with the Georgia Mustard, Devil's Spit or Wilbur's Revenge sauce. 

Ribs/rib tips: B+/A-. The ribs are pricey but tender and smoky. Sometimes overcooked. The tips come in a generous portion, naked with a rub, and a tangy sauce. They get a minus only because they're tips, not ribs. Still, I'd get them over the ribs just for the value.

Hot links: B. Good smoked sausage, nothing special. They seem overcooked sometimes, as well. I like them with the brisket on the Texas Manhandler sandwich. 

Chicken: smoked - B; roasted - C. Kinda greasy and made with scrawny chickens, but the BBQ chicken holds the smoke flavor well. Skip the roast chicken. It's got a sweet flavor with a hint of citrus. Lemon, maybe? I don't get it.

New: Burnt ends. B+. Would be an A if the portion was bigger. These are very tender, hold their smoke flavor and definitely worth trying. Just order an extra side so you don't leave hungry.

Wings: Skip them. My son thinks they made him sick. Possible, because they're just not good. Go to a wing joint for wings.

Sides: Beans C, potato salad B, coleslaw B+, fries B+, corn muffins B, corn cobs C-, garlic mashed potatoes B-, drunken apples B+ (my kids' fav side)."}
{"text":"My 11 yr old son enjoyed his bday lunch at Famous Dave's.  We were a party of 9 and ordered two \"Feast\" from the menu.  Teresa our server had outstanding customer service.  The food was served on two LARGE trash lids, very fun.  We all enjoyed TASTY bbq ribs, kielbasa, chicken, brisket, corn muffins, cole slaw, and beans.  We will go back again, especially for the delicious french fries.  Plenty of food, we had leftovers for the next day:)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. I had heard good things, so I had been wanting to check is out. 

Got the lunch special for $8.99... 2 meats, 1 side and corn bread.

Beef Brisket- 3 smallish slices. Very tender/juicy and nice smoke flavor

Rib Tips- nice smoke flavor. Not very meaty, but they are tips.

Jalapeño Mac n Cheese- Would have been good, if it wasn't cold.

Cornbread- Tasty but was completed l completely falling apart.

Overall... The BBQ was very good overall. I didn't care for the house BBQ sauce served on the plate and didn't care to try the others ( I prefer dry BBQ though). Was bummed about the Mac n cheese.. It's the details that sperate the good from the great!"}
{"text":"Good, but not as good as it could have been. It really should be 3.5 * 

Their sauces are awesome and should be tried by anyone who even remotely likes BBQ. That is a HUGE plus. Then it kind of goes downhill. Putting aside their pathetic excuse for ice tea, food was not as good as i would hope for.

Chicken always boring in this kind of places, just a grill chicken smothered with bbq sauce, or at least this is how it always seems to me.  This is how it was at Dave's too, so i did not get any this time around. Instead i went with Georgia Pulled Pork and Sweetwater Fish. Fish was just like a generic fried fish sticks and unless dunked into one of the sauces was not any interesting. Pork was better but not awesome. It was not ....hummm... how do you explain this.... falling apart enough. Does this make any kind of sense? It felt like it was rushed out of the smoker. It could use more time in there for sure.

Corn muffing was good, corn cob was fine and spicy beans, while on the stranger side, were alright as well. 

Their sauce rocks and makes anything taste like it = GOOD!

\"I like\"

{"text":"On a recent trip to the West Side I had a late lunch at this Daves. I loved the ribs, green beans, chips, corn muffin and especially the grilled pineapple. The bar service was good and friendly as well. The minus one star is that I had burnt fat and not burnt ends. But I Love Daves and will be back"}
{"text":"My husband is a hamburger connoisseur and he loved his burger.  It was fresh, not a frozen patty, and cooked a perfect medium. I had the St. Louis lunch ribs with beans, The ribs were tender and the beans had large pieces of meat in them. We shared the bread pudding for dessert and still ended up  taking half of it home. I would maybe recommend having the caramel sauce put on the side, the bread pudding a sweet enough on its own. Our waitress, Jami, was excellent."}
{"text":"This place gives you the choice to have your ribs dry-rubbed or with sauce which is great. I hate ribs that are doused in sauce since that destroys real BBQ. We got 1/2 slab of St. Louis with sauce and 1/2 slab of baby back with the dry rub. 
The Memphis-style/dry rub was very flavorful so I highly recommend your ribs that way. The sauced ones were baked on so at least it wasn't over powering. But the flavor wasn't as strong. 
We also got the chopped pork. Not bad but the ribs were by far much better.
Sides were ok. Flash fried green beans weren't anything more than steamed limpy looking and tasting green beans. I was expecting crispy or at least a little crisped up. Nada. Steamed broccoli was just that. Mac and cheese was fine."}
{"text":"Meh, it's chain BBQ. The house made BBQ chips served up front were tasty and a good way to sample the 5 or 6 sauces Dave's offers. Our server, while very nice, was quite slow. My wife was never given silverware and she ordered the stuffed potato. You sort of need a fork to eat that plate- the meal was almost lukewarm by the time we got silverware. Bummer. 

Our daughter's kid burger was extremely overcooked - like beyond well done (borderline hockey puck). She took a couple bites and was finished. My pulled pork sandwich was decent. The meat was a little on the dry side but enough BBQ sauce helped get it down. While the soft drinks are free refills, good luck getting a server to fill it back up. We have 1 total soda in the 45 minutes we were seated. Staff kept pushing the holiday gift card deal (buy $20 get $5 free) on us, was getting a little annoying. I'm sure that was tied to a store challenge or something. 

Overall the experience was just average. Food was fine (except for that petrified hamburger), service was friendly but slow, and we were at wits end with the gift card push... happy to move on."}
{"text":"Live this BBQ. I have take out here quite often. The service is fast. The employees are polite courteous and go the extra mile to make sure you are a satisfied customer. I have never had any issues. 

The Mac and Cheese is quite tasty and has a zesty kick to it. Wide variety of BBQ sauces from sweet tasting to fire hot. 

Nice convenient location with shopping and movies nearby. All around a great place for a quick lunch meal or dinner date."}
{"text":"Although I love bar-b-que, sometimes it doesn't love me back the following few hours.   Famous Dave's is great BBQ with a wide selection of different sauces. Excellent customer service, prompt delivery of fresh hot food, and a staff with a great attitude."}
{"text":"Ugh. This is the worst one I've been in. The brisket is riddled in fat. The sides have little to no flavor. Just take the extra time & go to the one at Chandler Fashion."}
{"text":"I didnt actually visit this location but I tried their booth at BITE of Las Vegas
I love Famous Dave's it's one of my favorite BBQ places but here at the festival things were a little overdone. You can see by the pics the ribs were a little crispy.I had 4 BBQ Ribs. But the BBQ Pork Sandwich was right on point-I love their pork & their BBQ sauce. Somewhat disappointed with the ribs but $5 for 4 and $5 for a sandwich not a bad deal."}
{"text":"Awesome place ,just not in the summer ,when you have to wait outside due to no room in the waiting area ,not even mist system for out side or free water being offered when u have to wait ,but besides all that good food ."}
{"text":"Went on my lunch break today, (which is only an hour but I work just down the street) my two friends and I ordered to go. They got meat platters or whatever and I got a burger. Their food came out in a reasonable amount of time, whereas as my one burger that I ordered took the full hour to make. Everyone in the back was fooling around chatting, they didn't seem too concerned about making my burger. Meanwhile I wasn't offered anything courtesy like a drink etc. until my friend had to ask! Won't be coming to this location again and I wouldn't recommend it either"}
{"text":"Today is the 1st day since eating at Famous Daves on Monday that I haven't been sick, we went as a family to have the All American Feast, something 4 people can share, started great with Burnt Ends and Onion Straws as appetizers but the main meal was off. 
The meal had Ribs, Pulled Pork, Chicken, fries, corn bread, beans and corn. The Coke slaw was SOUR! The only thing I ate no one else ate was the chicken and when you put BBQ sauce on it who can tell if it's good or bad....... But let me tell you it was bad and I've been in bed ever since!
I hate to say that about this place because it's one of my favorite BBQ places when not making it at home!"}
{"text":"It's always disappointment to see what not available on the menu. We come for the \"feast\" and surprise to learn, after the fact, that some components are missing. Not ok."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's..... it is what it is! Simply put, if you have eaten at any of them, the food is the same... finger licking good BBQ.  Now, if you haven't eaten at Famous Dave's, what are waiting for?  Just go and enjoy the hog and fowl dishes with a selection of 6 famous sauces from Devils Spit (Hot) to sweet & zesty (Mild). Mac n cheese isn't great but you're there for BBQ!"}
{"text":"The wife and I used to frequent the SanTan location often, when we lived in Mesa. We always had great service, and the place was always clean.

However, after moving to to the N. Phx area we tried this location, as it was the nearest.

We were in for a shock, it was a completely different experience.

We were seated fairly quick, and immediately noticed that the BBQ sauce assortment looked as it had not been cleaned in years. Every one of the containers had crusty discolored sauce caked on the tips. It was disgusting, but since we don't eat the sauces we were willing to overlook that.

The table was not clean, it had obviously gotten the two second wipe down. This is unacceptable at a BBQ place where most food is messy.

So, the food. I can't comment on this as we were never served, or even waited on.

We sat in our booth for a solid 10-15 minutes watching several of the wait staff walk by us, look at us, and do nothing.

The most annoying part were the seaters. They had 3-4 seaters huddled around the little podium, and one (the tall/larger one) kept looking at us. It was obvious she knew what was going on. Other tables around us even noticed we had not been waited on. None of the seaters bothered to do anything. There was no manager in sight either.

We got up, and proceeded to the door, when the taller seater woman blurts out \"Leaving Already?\"

I turned and said \"We have been waiting for 15 minutes, and have not even seen a waitress.\" She kinda gave a \"whatever\" look and said \"Have a great day!\"


So, after frequenting the SanTan location and receiving nothing but great service and a clean place to eat, we are NOT going back to the Peoria location. We drove ~10 miles to get there, and had to take our money elsewhere because they couldn't be bothered to serve us. 

We frequent places we like, and get good service. We eat out nearly every night as we both have busy careers and don't like to cook. Famous Daves Peoria lost out on \"regular\" customers, and we will not recommend them to any of our co-workers, or friends."}
{"text":"Dave's has been a staple for our family for a  long time. The loaded brisket potato is my go to meal whenever I go. 

Tonight's experience was pretty meager. The hostess was not personable, and appeared completely disinterested in her job. 

The brisket potato was dry, initially came with no butter. The waiter removed it from the bill, which was nice. The corn was outstanding, but the muffins were over cooked. 

Daves dropped a star for me tonight, saddened a bit."}
{"text":"This is my favorite barbecue place in the area. I wish I lived closer to it, I would be here all the time. Their brisket is to die for, their links are solid and truly tasty. The bread pudding for dessert is a treat, and the chocolate ice cream brownie is big enough for two. The meat here is just heavenly. The place is popular, and parking can be tough."}
{"text":"Some friends and I ate here Friday night. The food is pretty good at Famous Dave's, but it's far from the best. 

The Place is cliche family barbecue chain. You get a lot to eat for a decent price. Most meals come with two sides, corn, and a cornbread muffin. And like any family chain restaurant you have to look very deep into its massive menu to find something healthy. The best part is the sauce. Famous Dave's leaves six types on the table. All of them are good. I personally love the Devil's Spit. It's perfectly spicy, but still very flavorful. 

The staff was nice, but service was a little slow. In all fairness to the server, it was late and the kitchen was probably trying to clean up before we even got there.

Famous Daves is a place I'd go back to if some one wants to hit it up, but I don't think I'd go out of my way to eat there again."}
{"text":"Here at Dave's right now...been waiting for our food for 20 mins.  Other customers that got here after us already got served but us...and all waitress could say is \"sorry\". With no freakin explaination!"}
{"text":"Some restaurants have ways to distract patrons from inherent issues that make an average dining experience into something worse.  Enter the corporate crafted look of Famous Dave's.  While nothing about this franchise location is, in itself a deal breaker, there are enough individual problems to cause concern.  To be sure, flavor profiles are well crafted, but when you serve everything at varying degrees of warm instead of hot, one wonders if the microwave is doing the most work.  To back track, I started my meal with the chicken with wild rice soup.  Flavor was good, but the wild rice was under-cooked enough to be noticeable.  Next, the rather anemic sized brisket sandwich.  Flavor and seasoning was acceptable, but the meat was dry.  The small portioned sides also had good flavor, but were gone in three bites."}
{"text":"Very decent food and the reason it's getting one star is because of my very disappointing experience.... I ordered a two meat combo of country roasted chicken and Texas beef brisket with wilbur beans and steamed broccoli as my sides. I got to the restaurant ended up waiting an extra 15 minutes after the time it was supposed to be done at and somehow even with extra time they completely messed up my order. I got the country roasted chicken by itself no other meat with coleslaw and potato salad. How did that happen? I don't know but I didn't think to check my food at the restaurant and the employee didn't open the box and make sure everything was good like most restaurants do but I'll take the blame for that. Anyways I ended up paying extra and only getting one thing I actually ordered so I ended up at home with country roasted chicken and that's it nothing else of the order I placed. The restaurant was closing and I didn't even feel like bothering by calling them and leaving my house so I just ate the chicken very pissed off and threw the rest away. Anyways maybe this is just my experience but I thought it'd be good for everyone to know!"}
{"text":"I took my wife here last night about a week after my first visit. The food wasn't as good as it was last week. The country roasted chicken was bland and lacked the smokiness of the piece I had last week. I tried the coleslaw, which wasn't worth finishing. I'm wondering about the consistency, but I will give it another chance."}
{"text":"Discovered this BBQ gem! Great atmosphere, staff are jus awesome and the ribs are the best I've ever had. The pork nachos are the BOMB!!! I would recommend this place & beers are nice & cold & the price is right!! Great location to Harkins theater & MLB spring trading!!  You gotta try!! Family & I are definitely going to returning soon!!"}
{"text":"Had a drink at the bar first, always disappointed to see the bartender physically measure out the liquor...oh well. 

Dinner was fantastic and so was the service. They seemed to run an efficient dining room. Always a good choice for BBQ."}
{"text":"Went there this afternoon with our kids (4 of us).  Used my daughter's birthday coupon to get 1/2 off the 2nd entree.

We got the Feast for One (with the roasted chicken) and another entree of St. Louis Ribs with Texas Beef Brisket with mac & cheese with broccoli.  

Everything was delicious, though, my daughter commented she liked her aunt's ribs better.  This was a lot of food and we all ate until we were stuffed.  The Feast for One is enough food for 2 adults to get stuffed.

We went about 3:00 pm or a little later, so there were hardly any people in the restaurant.  Our server Sarah and the other people that helped were fantastic.  No complaints.  

It's a little pricey for what we usually do, but once in awhile and a coupon certainly does help.  The roasted chicken, the pork, the ribs, the brisket were all so yummy."}
{"text":"Was told to pick my order up at 605, didnt get my food until 640. They didnt seem to be prepared for a valentines day rush. There were no managers to be seen when things were chaotic. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"Famous Daves
Dinner was at the Famous Dave's located at 1011 N. Dobson Road, Mesa, Arizona. Start time was 7:00. We were a group of 13, mostly foodies.

Our group was seated outside. While we did have to wait until they had a table big enough for us all, they created one reasonably fast. Our waiter was cheerful and didn't mind all the separate bills. In fact he managed to joke about them without even crying. He also managed to get the drink orders right and even brought extras for some of the party. After giving us time to explore the large menu (perhaps just a bit too much time) a second waiter showed up to take the orders. He told us that the original waiter was having computer problems. We later found out that the computer problem was that he had about 16 other checks going at the same time. One has to wonder if the management might do with hiring a few more people.

I ordered the only appetizer at the table - Loaded BBQ chips. These were supposed
to be homemade chips topped with bleu cheese dressing and crumbles and loaded with jalapeno bacon and tomato concassee. Unfortunately, the waiter brought out just plain chips first, and didn't return with the proper ones until the main course arrived. We passed the loaded chips around and everyone who ate them pronounced them excellent and something they would order again.

For my main course I ordered their rib tip and brisket combo platter. The combo platters figure out to be the best price/value on the menu as you not only get two main courses, but you also get two sides, cornbread, and  1/2 corn on the cob as well. The rib tips were excellent - meaty, nicely cooked, with a nice smoke flavor that didn't really need any other sauce (though I did try a little of each sauce on the table for comparison). Unfortunately, I can't give the same rave review to the brisket. In all my life I have never eaten a piece of brisket like what I was served tonight. I and every one else who had the brisket agreed that it was more like processed and formed meat then real brisket. It was very dense, had little flavor, and zero fat on it. True brisket BBQ tastes nothing like what they served. No amount of any of their sauces was able to improve the meat.

I enjoyed the coleslaw though one of my companions felt it was too heavy with mayo and another felt it was a bit peppery. (It is made with jalapeno in it which may have accounted for the peppery taste). I had the firecracker green beans which were flaccid, overcooked and totally lacking in flavor and/or color. The corn on the cob was water logged and tasted like it had been cooked for hours in a kettle of sugar water.

Companions all felt the corn was beyond any help in this world. One companion had the chicken and pronounced it to be excellent, but again, did not care for the brisket. Another companion pronounced the broccoli to be very good, not over cooked and still green. Companion sitting next to me had the hot wings. She felt that the wings were cooked well, but the sauce was a disappointment - she would have preferred a much spicier sauce. This same companion also ordered cheese fries (not on the regular menu) and pronounced them delicious when asked about them.

Several other companions had ribs - both spare ribs and short ribs and all agreed they were cooked to perfection. One of the companions had the mashed potatoes, and felt they were very good and would be ordered again. Yet another companion had the Ultimate Burger, and I must admit it was one of the biggest burgers I've ever seen. The burger was topped with pulled port, cheddar cheese, and jalapeno bacon. Even though it was cooked medium well, it was juicy and tasty. The burger was topped with a Beam and Cola sauce which seemed to make it even better. This was a true winner.

All of the wait staff were friendly and fun do deal with. When mistakes were made, which is almost a guarantee with a group of this size they were promptly corrected and often removed from the bill.

Desserts are a weak point of this restaurant. Then again, most people don't go to a BBQ house with the intention of eating dessert. We were the exception!

In the area of cleanliness, the place seemed reasonable clean and bug free. The restroom was reasonable clean and supplied. Of note though was a puddle of water on the floor of the main dining room that no one seem to want to clean up. All it would take is for a patron to slip and the management would not have a good night.

My overall rating - 3 stars our of 5 possible.

Would I eat there again - yes but I'd avoid the brisket, veggies and desserts"}
{"text":"Ribs were great! Absolutely love the variety of sauces!
Our server was absolutely amazing very nice and kept checking in when necessary thank you Laurel S. Your amazing"}
{"text":"3 1/2 Stars.

Girl's choice last night.... and we (my sister, my niece Carol, and myself) ended up at the Famous Dave's in Chandler. These Famous Dave's look like every other one... typically bright Orange and Yellow! At night, you must have deficient eyesight if you can't find a Famous Dave's! In the evening, Famous Dave's is just a lighthouse beacon in the middle of a drab mall!

On the menu...

Blue Margarita (** 1/2) made with Blue Curacao - It's disconcerting when the last time you saw your niece she was just drinking Cokes... now it's Blue Margaritas. Must be getting old. In summary... not very toxic. Could have drank this in one gulp and wouldn't have had an effect! Machine mixed and made. Looked cool, though, with an Aquamarine Blue color.

All American BBQ Feast (****) Gimmick is that all this stuff ( Full Slab of St Louis style SpareRibs (*****), Whole BBQ Chicken (*** 1/2), 1/2 lb of Texas Beef Brisket (*****), Famous Fries (*****), 2 Baked Potatoes with all the Fixin's (*****) replaced the Coleslaw and Wilbur Beans, 4 Corn on the Cob (***), 4 Muffin Style Corn Bread (****) ) is served on a bright, shiny, galvanized Garbage Can lid. Some of the items definitely lacking in BBQ flavor.

Hot Fudge Kahlua Brownie (**) Warm, Walnut covered Chocolate Brownie, soaked with Kahlua Liquer and topped with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, Hot Fudge, and (loads and loads of) Whipped Cream. Ice Cream and Kahlua was no-where to be found!

Total tab: $82.08. Not bad for the amount of food.

Service (****) This is a total generalization... but what the heck! The wait-staff at Famous Dave's is totally opposite from the previous evening's robotic lifeless performance from the wait-staff at Olive Garden ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/olive-garden-italian-restaurant-chandler#hrid:l6HajH2UNtb1EZMTj19Ccg  ). I really don't give a darn if it's just a performance... the attitude that the wait-staff presents will be passed onto the customers... whether bad or good.

Typical of all Famous Dave's you sit at a booth or table covered with Red and White checkered table-cloths. At the front entrance is a display of all the BBQ awards that Famous Dave's BBQ items have won.... mostly in the MidWest. Check out the lead-pipe utilitarian interior design... Cool!

Very colorful and festive atmosphere! Kids or adults with a kid's attitude will love Famous Dave's."}
{"text":"Really is the best franchise BBQ in my opinion, I can drink the stuff.  The service is always great and the atmosphere is very upper end casual.  I noticed today that they have a 600 calorie menu but none of their BBQ is on it so whats the point.  The ribs are good except the small bones you find in the pork ones.  All the sides are good and they have great drinks as well.  I recommend coming for lunch to save some money and still enjoy a great BBQ meal."}
{"text":"We like Famous Dave's. Great service. Great food. Everything we have tried we love!"}
{"text":"Of course we like this place cause of Happy Hour.  Half off appetizers and drink specials.  We also have sat for dinner/lunch and the food is awesome.  

Cat fish, brisket, rib, and rib tips are always ordered.  Oh, and the cornbread muffins are a must have.  We order extra cause the kids eat all of them.  When we are super hungry we go for the Feast.

When we are craving BBQ and too lazy to cook, this is our go to.  But of course we try to shoot for Happy Hour."}
{"text":"First off let me say our waiter Daniel has been the best waiter we have ever had! Food came out faster then we expected, or as my wife said freaky fast. Since we have been here before i csn only say the food was great or else we would have never came back as much as we do. The staff is super awesome sauce, we came all the way from west phoenix to dine here and will be back."}
{"text":"This was our first time here!!! I will not be going back!! My son and I both had bones in our pulled chicken sandwiches. This was not a pleasant experience. I usually don't write negative reviews but I'm very concerned for young children due to the choking hazard this presents. Check your sandwiches before you sink your teeth into them."}
{"text":"Best bbq by arrowhead! Their chicken is delicious I never had chicken like that before! My girlfriend demolished the chicken and her cornbread! The customer service was awesome the bathrooms were nice and clean overall I had a great experience with my girlfriend at famous Daves! They had the game on which was another plus now for a few negatives macaroni was watery with corn in it and the mash potatoes seemed plain but that's it for the negatives. so my girlfriend ordered the banana pudding and she said it would be perfect without having the cream on it so she took it off and said it was awesome! I give famous Daves 4 out of 5 I've had better bbq and the sides were okay the chicken and customer service is was really shined to me!:)"}
{"text":"I would love to bump Famous Daves (FD) up to 4 stars. Even for someone who isn't crazy about BBQ, I can appreciate the great flavors you get from some good smokey BBQ. I really like FD's beef brisket and salt water catfish. The brisket is perfectly cooked encompassing all of the natural flavors of the cut of meat. The catfish, while small, are seasoned perfectly. Corn muffins are pretty damn good to be restaurant. Very buttery, moist and lighted toasted. Services generally has always been good.

Now, where I have to knock off some points is their banana pudding. When they do have it in stock, I always get it because it is that damn good. Absolutely amazing. The only person I know  that makes great banana pudding is my auntie. However, considering the non-instant kind of banana pudding is time consuming, she can't always make me a batch. It's nice to have a restaurant in town that serves it and serves it well.

The last three times I've dined at FD, they were complete out. One time, we even asked the waiter if they had any and we were told yes. Well, when it comes time to order it, we are told they were out. What?! How can this be so!? 

 Last time we dined, we (again) asked the waiter if they had any. He said yes. OK. About 15 minutes later, he tells us there was only enough to make 1 more serving. Our table had to share it.

I am not sure how many batches they make during a day but I would recommend they make more. The last three times we've came, it as during general dinner hours so it is not like we are coming too late in the day and are just missing out. It seems that they simply do not make enough. Their banana pudding is the most popular dessert. That being said, why not make extra when there is high demand? 


Also, they got rid of the apples. Not sure why when they were very popular."}
{"text":"my husband and I used to come here a lot but we haven't been in awhile so we decided to come in for lunch today. unfortunately we were not please food was not as warm Id say lukewarm and also it was freezing cold in there which made me not want to eat we just asked for doggie bags to box up our food and eat it later :( . our waitress Alex was awesome and attentive to us constantly!"}
{"text":"Smoked baby back ribs melted in my mouth! You have to order baby backs if you go here. Also had the brisquet!! Amaze balls!!! Great service ! It was a little loud inside but can't count that against the place! We'll return for more smoked BBQ!!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is try the St Louis ribs they are absolutely amazing they get to good portions of your choice of meat A cornbread muffin and a side for under $12 you can't beat that for good food"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I have been here.  I've been craving Famous Dave's for a while.  We just were here yesterday and I ordered my usual St. Louis 6 ribs with a salad and broccoli.  The salad and broccoli were fine, but the ribs...  What happened?  The were tiny and overcooked.  Out of the 6, I think one was pretty good at best.  The rest were tough and when I'd take a bite, it was like I was biting into leather. 

You've lost me Famous Dave's.  I'll be sticking to the local BBQ now."}
{"text":"Ive reviewed the location in Chandler and this one feels the exact same. Love love love Famous Dave's.

Im not a big fan of their sides, but their corn, corn bread and ribs are the best Ive ever had.  In fact, I think Id rather replace two sides with two more ears of corn.. lol.  Wonder if I can do that.

Great service and we were seated quickly :)"}
{"text":"Stopping in your this BBQ place the other night as we're were in the area. Fairly simple set up. Was greeted at the door and opted to take two seats at the bar.

Our bartender and server was Cole and the drinks and food were just as we'd ordered. We shared a plate of the chicken and brisket, a salad and a bowl of the potato soup.

Every thing paird nicely with Old Chub, a Scottish Style Ale from Oskar Blues which surprisingly they had on tap."}
{"text":"I never write reviews for restaurants because I've worked in one so I get how it goes, but literally everything about this time around was just all bad. 

DO NOT BOTHER COMING HERE AT ALL UNLESS YOU WANNA WAIT 2 HOURS FOR FOOD AND RECEIVE SHITTY SERVICE!!!!!!!!

A couple months ago, I call to ask how long the wait is for 2 people so they tell me 30 minutes. I decided I will just order over the phone and just pick it up. They told me 15 minutes it will be ready so I come to the restaurant roughly 25 minutes after I placed my order. You know, I gave them a little extra time to have it ready and what not. I get there and they say it isn't ready and it will be 15 minutes so I go outside the door to just stand and wait since already 2 people were inside waiting. I come back after 15 minutes and they are just barely putting my food into the container. 

Tonight, we went to have dinner around 540pm. We were greeted by 3 lovely people, they sat us down right away. Waited roughly 10 minutes for our waiter, she eventually comes takes our drink order then never comes back for 15 minutes. She comes back, gives our drinks and asks if we're ready so we order. 30 minutes after we ordered a couple walks in and gets seated behind us. We have the same waiter so after a while they order. They got their food 15 minutes after ordering. So we noticed, but didn't say anything. I mean how hard is it to toss a salad together and throw some brisket pieces on it and then to put some pulled pork on a sandwich bun. It honestly isn't that hard because we didn't even order anything complex to make. So the couple who came 30 minutes after us is already done with their food and our food is barely coming to us. We get the wrong order... my bf ordered the Georgia pork sandwich and he gets a brisket sandwich, but he's like whatever I'm not going to wait again for my right order I waited long enough so I'll just eat it. So he takes a bit and it is really salty so he didn't bother with it anymore. He was already pissed so I just said let's go, take the sandwich and our dog can eat it. We can get dinner somewhere else. Our waiter never came to check if we needed refills.. never even came to make sure our food was good. I ask the one of the hostess for a to-go box and my check so she comes back with the box and said she has to go find my waiter to get my check so that's fine. 20 minutes go by and she comes with it. I look at the check and instead of putting a pulled pork sandwich she puts brisket so that's how we ended up with the wrong order. We didn't have a big party of 10, there was only 2 of us.. she didn't bother writing our order down and just decided to memorize it but she fucked up on remembering what he had ordered. So you would think by now she knows we're ready in a couple minutes she will come back and get my card to swipe and whatever.. nope.... definitely did not come back. My bf is already out the door, furious at the service we received. I didn't wanna pay for our meal, not because I wanted to be rude and get free food. She never came back so I threw a $20 under my receipt and left. Literally, everything was so bad. When we came everyone around us was eating and probably more than half the restaurant was empty. I should have known from not to come back when I ordered my food to go and they said 15 minutes but it took longer."}
{"text":"solid bbq not great but never been dissapointed very good burnt ends good burgers if someone in group doesn't wan't bbq like the beans and cornbread good kids meals at ressonable prices my kids love that they come with oreos have always had solid service prices on par with other bbq joints like the variety of sauce choices hubby loves the blues music they play"}
{"text":"We like Famous Dave's so much that we actually let them cater our wedding! The ribs and chicken and bbq sauce are good but I feel like the sides are where Famous Dave's really shines--amazing cornbread, mashed red potatoes, corn on the cob, chili, fries--heck, even the fried beans are good! Very nice servers, enormous portions so you get good bang for your buck, and just an overall friendly experience eating here."}
{"text":"A+++! First of all, the service was 5 star. Our server was amazing, and the manager was so sweet and hospitable. We are new to he area and we're having lunch why we awaited signing papers on our new home and these ladies just ,ace us feel so welcome and right at home! And the food- amazing! The flavors were delicious, food was fresh, and dessert was sinful! I even left with a bottle of BBQ sauce because it's THAT good! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Famous Dave's by the Chandler Mall a few times and thought it was just ok.  I was not a fan.  However, I was very surprised that this location was way better in every way from the one I was used to.  Better food, better service, and better decor/ambiance.  I don't know how two places from the same franchise can be so different but it totally changed my opinion of the whole chain.  The food was very tasty, all of us at the table really liked our barbecue.  The server took the time to explain the different sauces to us and even drew a little design as she squirted them onto the plate.  She was on top of everything and very friendly even though the place was pretty packed.  This location has a real open feel to the dining room so it was a bit noisy but overall a fun, lively atmosphere.  I will definitely return and hope to try other locations as well."}
{"text":"This Famous Dave's location just doesn't do it for me and I'm not really sure why. Something about the way it's laid out always makes it feel cramped and noisy. Or maybe its because it's always full or screaming kids who are tired and hungry after a long day at the mall? The severs are great but can never seem to keep up with the sheer volume of patrons and so its always a little messy, too. Food is pretty much the same as the rest of chain so I won't bother going into it."}
{"text":"Burnt ends sandwich was so dry couldn't chew it up and swallow it. Bread was falling apart as if it was old. Server took order then never saw her again. Someone else brought food she finally came by later to ask about dessert. It's been awhile since we have been here and now I remember why. Dave needs to get in here and kick some butt!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Pretty good bbq for a chain restaurant. It definitely is a lot better than Rudy's. i wish they had given a little more meat (we ordered the larger family meal); my husband and his sister both said that it seemed like they give less now."}
{"text":"The manager Ryan is a homophobic asshole. I would give you more details if i wasn't afraid for my life. I will never bring my friends and family here."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's BBQ is about average. The meat isn't as tender or flavor filled as others in the Phoenix area but it is a more convenient option since there are multiple locations closer to where I live than say Bobby Q or Little Miss BBQ. This Mesa location is in the Riverview shopping area. The layout was spacious and we had no problem getting a table on a Friday night. 

Every Famous Dave's will start you out with some complimentary chips and they'll squirt out some BBQ sauce on a plate for you to dip the chips with. Our server made a cute little piggy face design on ours which was a nice touch. I wanted a little variety in my meal so I had the 2 item combo surf and turf style with catfish fingers and pulled pork. Your combo will include 2 sides so I went with a healthier route, opting for steamed broccoli and green beans. 

The food didn't take too long to make, probably just a few minutes and we were ready to dig in! The plate itself didn't look like a lot of meat to me but it did fill me up by the time I was done. The pulled pork was placed on a piece of white bread and drizzled with their Sweet and Sassy BBQ sauce. The catfish fingers were lightly battered and fried, and were tender but a bit too salty for me. The sides were decent, the veggies were both cooked as described. 

Our server was Alex and he was great at getting drinks filled and making sure our meals were to our liking.

3.5/5"}
{"text":"Tender bbq meat, friendly service, and good lunch specials.  We headed here after shopping at the Chandler Fashion Mall.  It was crowded around 1ish when we were here, but there was plenty of seating outside, and it was a nice day, so we ate on the patio.

They have some good, reasonably priced lunch specials.  My husband had the pulled pork sandwich ($6.99) which included one side and a cornbread muffin.  I opted for the one-meat platter ($7.99) which also includes one side and cornbread.  For those that are really hungry, you can upgrade to a 2 meat platter for a dollar more.  

There are various platter meats to choose from, including pulled pork, brisket, chicken, and a beer-battered cod.  I opted for the cod, which had a very crispy, crunchy crust.  The cod, however, was just a step up from the Gorton's Fisherman.  It was a little tough and dry.  I tried the pulled pork sandwich, which had a hearty amount of meat on plain hamburger bun.  The meat itself was tender, and had a good amount of smokey flavor, but for me, there was a little bit of a weird aftertaste with the meat at the end.  

For sides, there are a multitude to choose from, including fries, mashed potatoes, baked beans, and green beans.  I tried the mashed potatoes, which had a strong garlic flavor, and had a light, whipped texture.

Service was friendly, and drinks were refilled promptly as needed.  Overall, a decent price for decent food for lunch."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with coworker. This was our first time coming here and was shocked about the poor service we received and the quality of our food. We won't be returning!"}
{"text":"We have come here many times in the last few months, we have never found a bad waiter or waitress. And that means a lot. All day Saturday they offer happy hour, where appetizers are half price. They also have drink discounts but I'm not sure what they are. When you arrive they bring a little bowl of chips to your table. The sauces are really good and you can have as much of them as you want.
We really enjoyed the burnt ends. The brisket is also very good. The fries are the thick cut wedges and if you're into them they are one of the best in the valley, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Lots of places claim that they serve big portions at reasonable prices.  Well, they must use a strange meaning of the word \"Big\" that I am not aware of, as the portions are not usually that big.  However, here at Dave's they certainly were not kidding.  We ordered the feast for two, but it easily could have been a feast for three or four.    I would be wary of ordering the feast for four, as I don't think my car would be big enough to carry the left-overs home! Okay, so that is an exaggeration, but they do serve plenty for very reasonable prices.  And it was DELICIOUS as well.  I am not a fan of messy barbecue sauce smothered over pieces of meat, but DAVE'S sauce is the best I have tasted in a long time. They have four varieties, and they give you a plate of chips to test them all out to pick out your favorite.  The Texas style was my favorite.  the service was fast and friendly, and the server was very knowledgeable about the sauces.  I don't often return to BBQ places, because, like I said, I am not a big BBQ fan, but Dave's is definitely on the list of places to return to."}
{"text":"The manger came to our table to take our drink order and he was awesome. The service was amazing by everyone we encountered. The food was as good as the service. It is a little pricey but worth the extra money."}
{"text":"Our absolute favorite place for BBQ!  Anytime we are in Phoenix we have to come here.  Ribs, brisket, pulled pork, BBQ chips, garlic mashed potatoes, everything is good!  Service is fantastic.  Always friendly.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Delish BBQ most of everything you get has a \"kick\" to it.. Great lunch specials.  Love the pickles.  I did try the mini bread pudding for dessert it was delish."}
{"text":"Hit or miss in terms of the quality of ribs. They are very good in most occasions but can be overlooked. Friendly service and immediate seating. I like Miller lite but they don't come only in bottles so that I have to order them multiple times. I wish they come in pint size draft beer. A reasonable price but the restroom may look spooky to young girls."}
{"text":"One of the things I love most about birthdays - Free Meals!!

I received via email (join their PIG Email Club) a screamin coupon deal (free entree with entree purchase of equal or greater value, up to $15) for J's birthday.  Score!

Moved to the bar area, due to it being too hot where we were originally seated (right next to the to-go area).  Service in both areas was good. 

Everything that came to the table - 

Chips - Its a chip mystery.  Greasy, but somehow still crisp.  We would have preferred a bowl of pickle chips instead prior to our meal. 

Speaking of the pickle chips - COSTCO sells them!  :D  After all the chips are gone, keep the brine!  I'll make some hard boiled eggs and pickle them in the brine.  J loves them!

Texas Manhandler - According to J - \"It was tasty.  The Brisket was tender, juicy and succulent.  The sausage had the right amount of snap and was well seasoned.  The addition of the Firecracker Pickles added a sweet and spicy dimension that made it an overall, highly enjoyable sandwich on some of the softest, yet robust buns.  With a little Devil's Spit BBQ Sauce, it is a must eat for the Carnivores out there.\"  Thanks J!  ;D

Southside Rib Tips - Huge portion! Tips were nice and meaty.  Cooked to perfection - Very tender. 

Ear Corn - Not \"sweet corn\" but field corn (as Papa would call it). I think its boiled in sugar water to give it a slightly sweet taste. 

Famous Fries - Nice thick cut steak/wedge style fries.  Lightly salted. Skip dipping in catsup!  But if you're a dipper, use the bbq sauces. 

Drunkin' Apples - LOVE! Thank gawd somewhere else other than Cracker B. makes these. 

Jalapeno Mac & Cheese - Awesomeeeeee!  Creamy with just a hint of a bite from the diced Jalapenos.  The corn provides a sweet and textural counterpoint to the pasta and cheese.

Corn Muffins - LOVE!  It reminds me of my own cornbread.  And I hate to say it , but they're better than mine.  If I can hold out, I usually save mine and eat it for breakfast the next morning. They have little muffin cups so you can take yours home.  :)

Famous Sundae - This was free and a surprise (because of J's birthday)
The vanilla bean ice cream was not cloying. Ours was drizzled with delicious hot fudge and topped with whipped cream.  The whipped cream was a little much though.  If I would have known they were bringing it out, I would have asked them to go easy with the whip. 

The portions they give you with the dinners are huge.  My leftovers (rib tips) lasted me for 2 days.  Ask for an extra muffin cup and take home some sauce for your leftovers."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is our go to lunch spot and date night. Surprised when I tried their fish and chips on a whim.. EXCELLENT!!!  'Famous Hayden' is very attentive and our favorite server. We will always come here! The employees are always smiling and the managers are always active on the floor. Love love LOVE Famous Dave's!!!"}
{"text":"Saturday night I was at Famous Dave's celebrating my birthday with 5 other relatives and I had the worst service ever.  We noticed people getting their dinner before us but were seated after us.  Asking what's going on they said the server forgot to put in our order or something.  Then the manager came over with a bunch of BS and very cocky I might add to apologize for the error and also said it takes longer to cook hamburgers.  Whatever, it was a bad night at Famous Dave's.  Some of the ribs were very chewy.  Oh yes, my wife got my hamburger and I got hers.  I guess I'll be staying away for a while at this place."}
{"text":"During my four years in Mad-Town, I enjoyed this hometown BBQ pit probably 30 times. Except for the time the waitress literally told me to \"clean my face\" (not joking), the food has always been pretty solid and the service fairly quick. Lots of parking."}
{"text":"Best draft beers in town. Severed ice cold in a frost glass. Food is great, but even if it wasn't I'll still come here for the beer because it's that good."}
{"text":"We have went to this location several times and have been happy with our meal and service each time.  You can get some really good BBQ here and they have delicious bread pudding.  We enjoy having dinner here."}
{"text":"I came in to buy a gift card...simple right? I had asked for a $15 gift card. Well I guess the cashier didn't hear me correctly and had put more on the card than I wanted. She then had to call I believe her manager over to override and redo the balance on the card...I paid then I needed change. Well I guess the cashier couldn't get into the drawer so she called the manger over again. And from there the customer service when down hill. Everyone had an annoyed or pissed off look on their faces. Then they proceeded to slam the register drawers in front of me. I get it's frustrating but it wasn't my fault things didn't go smoothly. I just felt as if they where angry at me for even coming in to buy the gift card."}
{"text":"Came back years after the total disaster, hard as a rock rib experience ... hoping this place had gone under. Will check back in another 4 1/2 years with the same intent. Yes, the meal was THAT bad."}
{"text":"I've loved Daves for years.  Great food no matter which one I go to.  Great atmosphere.  Friendly service."}
{"text":"Good service, tasty sauces and meat, very good sides and filling. 

Excellent adventure and food!

I arrived about 30 min before closing (after flying in) and they were very courteous and seated me quickly, took my order, suggested some sides and got the food to me quickly and very hot and fresh. 

I had the catfish fingers (yummy!), the two meat combo ( baby back ribs and chopped pork) corn muffin, corn on the cob, Cole slaw, and cheesy Mac (had corn and jalapeño peppers in it) with sweet tea. Lots of food and I took my time and as it was all so good ended up only taking the corn muffin home with me and it was great the next morning with my coffee. All during my time there they checked to see if I needed anything else, kept my tea full and provided excellent, non rushed and friendly service. 

I'll say it again good food, service and excellent experience overall. I highly recommend a visit and I will be returning when in the area. 

Hope you have as good or better experience if you get to visit."}
{"text":"What a great experience our server Spencer was an awesome server, the ribs were big and delicious and upon Spencer's recommendation we also ordered the rib tips....oh my. We will be coming back. Friendly staff, great service, and we loved the BBQ."}
{"text":"Server was good but the food lacked. Food came out Luke warm and lacked flavor. For the price I could have gone to a few other places for hot flavorful food. 

Not only was it warm and not full of flavor the kitchen was so slow it took 35 minutes to get food out which was not even well prepared. This much time I would expect hot food and flavor. My toast for example was only toasted on one side the sausage was reheated from the night before because it was cold on the middle. Two salads and chili and lunch platter and kids corn dogs and it took 35 minutes for what I gather was microwaved. 

Really sad I wanted to like the food. Again the server was great but was hammered by his kitchen coworkers."}
{"text":"Mediocre. My wife and I were not that impressed and won't be going back. Service was okay, just not very warm and friendly from our server. And the barbecue was a little dry, as well as the corn bread. There are better barbecue places."}
{"text":"Excellent carry out service. Open your order boxes to make sure it us correct. Plenty for a serving!"}
{"text":"Famous Daves never disappoints. The pulled pork, jalapeño Mac and cheese, and Wilbur beans are awesome. At this particular Famous Aves, Wednesday night is $1 beer night, which doesn't suck. 

Yes, it's a chain, but it's darn good."}
{"text":"Stepped in for a margarita and catfish fingers. The service was awesome, food was great!"}
{"text":"Dave's has the best pulled pork barbeque sandwich i have ever tatsted over here! Its moist,tastes great and plenty of it. They also have great baked beans and cornbread.  You have got to try this place if you haven't already!!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour at the bar is finger lickin' good and cheap.  Four of was went and probably spent around $50 dollars for everything.  We ordered pork rib tips, a little dry but still good.  The nachos has bbq sauce on it, that was interesting.  The onion rings was a smaller amount than I thought it would be but were crispy and not too salty. You do have to sit in the bar area for happy hour, that's the only kicker besides trying some of Famous Dave's sauces. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for being a chain BBQ place.  Aside from it getting pretty busy (which I guess is a good thing) I have never had a bad experience.  
The service is always great, very friendly and helpful.   The bbq is also excellent.  I love everything from the rib tips to the wings.  The brisket can be a little dry at times so just a heads up.  I usually always get the pulled pork and some spare ribs. Love the corn bread muffins.  
Also if you like a good spicy BBQ sauce. Try mixing the Devils Spit with the Texas Pit.. Definitely a must for me when I go here. 
I also love that they are still one of the few places that give Vets a free meal on Veterans Day.  Give to the community and the community returns in kind.  Can't say that about many chain restaurants."}
{"text":"The food is really good but there can be a wait on the weekend. Once you're seated the food comes really quick.  Service is great Ray is an awesome waiter he was very attentive to our table.  The brisket was really good the first time we went very lean but the second time it was full of fat not much meat.  The manager said they serve it that way now but you can ask for the lean cut when you order so it would not have the fat.  They have a variety of BBQ sauces to choose from and a lot of appetizers."}
{"text":"I love Famous Dave's and have loved it for a very long time! 
My favorites are their lunch combos and the big meal served in a trash can lid. 
You get a little bit of everything and can share with the family. 
Another plus for this restaurant is I have never encountered a rude or unfriendly server."}
{"text":"We came here looking for a good bbq place.  We took some BBQ to go home a take ou order of course we did not know what to order since we had not been there before.  So we ordered a little bit of pulled pork and beef brisket, bbq chicken and wanted the mac and cheese but do not like bacon.  the coleslaw they give you with the order is so small it does not even feed one person.. the corn bread was just okay, it is better across the way @ cracker barrel...the BBQ chicken and the pork was a little dry, the brisket was tasty but I have had better...The banana pudding to go was not worth the $7.00 and was way too sweet.  Not real impressed for the take out realm and probably will not try again...we went during lunch time and the place was empty except for us."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE Dave's (see previous 4 star reviews from earlier this year) but something changed. The last few times I've gone there the food is not as good as it used to be and the service is slipping as well. Turnover in help? Change in management? Just another got-too-big-for-our-britches story? Your guess is as good as mine..
First it was the meat, instead of being hot and fresh, tender and juicy, it was warm and dried out, as if it had been left under a heat lamp or reheated in a microwave. The baby back ribs used to be fat and meaty, lately they are lean and fatty/tough. Then the service started to be less than friendly and careless, twice I received the wrong order and had to return to get it fixed.
The last time I went there, figuring I'd give it another try as everyone has \"off\" days, was the final straw. The meat was dried out and stringy, the Wilbur's beans were soured (gone bad, gone over, whatever)..as if they had been not refrigerated and stored properly and reheated many times over. I was sick from eating just two bites. The coleslaw was full of tough inedible cabbage stalk pieces (either someone just doesn't care or they are really cutting costs) and an overabundance of jalapeno peppers which overwhelmed the usually sweet/hot balance of the slaw.
Having a bad day is one thing, bad food that makes people sick is entirely a different animal and is indicative of a more serious issue going on at the restaurant. There is absolutely NO excuse for food improperly stored or cooked that is full of bacteria.

Famous Dave...PLEASE WAKE UP AND FIX YOUR PROCESS before it's too late!!!"}
{"text":"WARNING: BBQ AT IT'S MOST ADDICTIVE!!!

I love Famous Dave's, we try to come here at least weekly for lunch. friendly staff, reasonably quick service, and the meat just melts in your mouth. They have a good selection of their own sauces (5 or 6), from sweet n' sassy to 'devil spit', tasty fries, and awesome cornbread muffins.

Try the rib combo platter with some brisket, or the Texas Manhandler Sandwich (Memphis Style). 

Can get a little crowded at lunch, especially on Fridays.

Join the PIG (Pretty Important Guest) club for special offers & free Lil' Wilbur meals for kids on their birthday.

You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Alejandra was our server last night and she was terrific--cheerful and engaged but not intrusive. She took great care of us. I could see her scan her tables on each trip in and out of the kitchen so she saw instantly when we needed more drinks and brought them and when the check was ready. We've always enjoyed FD's ribs but last night we tried the brisket and chopped pork sandwiches and they were delish. And we love the pickles and chips!"}
{"text":"This review is for their catering.  We were served three kinds of meat for build-your-own sandwiches, of course hamburger buns, BBQ beans, corn bread muffins, and coleslaw.  They had packets of BBQ sauce available, but I found I didn't need them because the flavor was already saturated through the food.  My taste buds that register delicious were all activated.

I was happy to see the packets of hand wipes, since BBQ can be messy.  Overall?  Woohoo!"}
{"text":"I tried very hard to like Famous Dave's.  Being a burger conoisseur, I ordered a cheeseburger, which was terrible!  It smelled and tasted like cheap, low-quality pre-formed, super flat and compacted, boxed meat patties from the supermarket, with a medicinal aftertaste that is hard to describe.  Moreover, they couldn't even accomodate me with sauteed onions, which I asked for.  You would think a restaurant that has the words 'famous' and 'Bar-B-Que' would know how to make a kick butt, world class, thicker, hand-formed burger!  I'm not expecting a Michael Symon's B-Spot burger, but for chrissakes, be at least as good as a 'Five Guys' burger.  At least the chicken nachos were very good, but that was just my appetizer.  Being dissatisfied with my meal, I had to attempt dessert for redemption, and the bread pudding tasted good, but was very heavy and mushy.  It had a consistency more like custard, and should be lighter.  Quickly ensuing consumption of the bread pudding, I experienced an onset of  'the instant runs', and like the great 80's comedian George Wallace said regarding Taco Bell (and presumably similar weighty food like this bread pudding), \"you may as well just throw it directly in the toilet, because that's where it ends up quickly\"!  'Nuff said..."}
{"text":"So i usually Love Famous Daves, but tonight they really dropped the ball. I was there with a somewhat large group so I expected there to be some confusion. But we waited almost 40 minutes before the first plates came out, and once they did at least half of our food was incorrect as well as cold! I ended up sending mine back and I will say that it did come back piping hot. My issue is with the fact that we kept getting told that it was super slammed in the kitchen, but yet our meals come out cold. Which tells me they sat for a while in the back. My second issue is that we asked for a manger and he peeked out and went back inside when he saw that some of the plates had been delivered (maybe he. Got called away before coming out, but that's definitely what it looked like). He eventually came out and delivered my second order of food and then left again. He never came out to check once we all had our meals to see how everything was. If you're not going to offer any type of apology at least offer some type of dessert or discount on the meal. But no one really said anything. Our server was apologetic, but a manager really should have gotten involved after we had so many issues with the food. Super disappointed with our experience."}
{"text":"When this place first opened we were all pretty psyched cause the only place you could get decent barbecue in the area was that place that used to be by chuck e. cheeses \"Tony romas\". they had tasty ribs but they were dry/overcooked. Famous daves opened and had in my opinion some of the best ribs and sauces i ever had. The variety of sauces was great, no more having to choose just one sauce.  And the ribs were super tender......we went there constantly in the first 2years until one time my brother and i and his 2 friends all went there one night and had a great rib dinner and walked out and we all got sick. My brother and his friend vomitted in the parking lot. When i got home i started getting really sick that night and bad cramps. Anyways i to this day have no idea how it happened cause none of us lived together or were drinking so to me the ribs must have been spoiled or maybe side dishes or something but i never went back cause it was the sickest i ever got from eating food in my life."}
{"text":"We live in Florida, when Irma hit we drove home to Madison and the first place we went to was Famous Dave's the best Restraunt in madison the Cajun  chicken sandwich is to die for worth the trip from florida to Madison"}
{"text":"Returned for a second visit with my wife and found the place was fairly crowded. It was a weekend, so I figured that was to be expected. We put our names on the list with the three people working the seating at the counter, then sat down within a few feet of them and began our wait. 

Fifteen minutes later, they call our name, party of two. I go up there immediately to find them escorting two elderly people away, following the guy who had called our name. Those elderly people had just walked in and hadn't even put their names on the list yet. I asked the other two at the counter what the third gentleman was doing, taking those people to our table when they called out our name. 

So the guy returns from seating them and tells us, \"Oh they said they were you,\" as his excuse. I overheard the whole exchange and never once did they say they were us. What really happened was that they happened to be standing there, he assumed they were the party of two he was supposed to be seating and he said, \"Right this way folks!\" and they followed him to (what should have been) our table. 

Nevertheless, confronted with this, the coward continued to put the blame for his idiotic mistake squarely on the shoulders of the innocent elderly couple who didn't even know what had happened. This was some high school kid with the wanna-be goth / emo thing going on, jet black hair and some kind of ridiculous black earring 'thing' dangling out of his left ear. Yeah, really classy having this guy scapegoat a couple in their 80s because he wasn't man enough to admit he screwed up and simply took the first warm bodies he could find to the table.

The staff doing the seating did nothing for us. No call to the manager, no offer to compensate us for having to wait for another table after their mistake. \"Oh, you can have the next one, just go back to waiting.\" No sincere apology, especially not from the emo coward, who scurried away as quick as he could, leaving the two girls to speak with the angry customers themselves. 

I informed them that I wasn't going to wait again and was taking my business somewhere else where they don't give away my table to what is obviously the wrong party. All three of them saw my wife and I, knew which party we were and they knew those people who just walked up to the counter were not us, they hadn't even put their name on the list yet. I can understand if one of them wasn't paying attention, but all three of them? If you cannot have three people properly taking customers from point A to point B, I'm sorry but you have an issue. 

I later called and chewed out the manager as well as telling him who was involved and how they cowardly pinned the fault on the elderly people. He assured me corrective action would be taken, but still defended emo-kid. 

The last straw was when he told me that next time I should ask for a manager when I arrive, so he can make sure I'm treated properly on the next visit. I told him I shouldn't have to fetch a manager to make sure that a customer is treated properly, that should happen regardless. Apparently he hadn't figured that out before I told him. 

I won't be returning to this place if that's how you treat people and how clueless the management is. Giving away tables, blaming the elderly and no involvement from the manager? Talk about three strikes."}
{"text":"I'm upgrading my review for the sole reason that the St Louis ribs are fabulous. I take mine naked, and I've never been disappointed...

Famous Dave's isn't bad for a chain restaurant. It has all the annoying chain restaurant decor and lack of actual character (down to a poor employee dressed as a pig), but those negatives are offset by decent food and service.

The pulled pork is fine, though a little dry and sometimes a burned chunk can show up on your plate. The sauces are good, with several options on your table. The corn bread muffins are fine, but the corn on the cob is typically overcooked. They do have fantastic coleslaw and great beans, so if you pick your sides carefully, you can end up with a good meal.

I don't like the restaurant area (too many people, too much clutter on the walls, too noisy and too many wandering pig mascots), so I generally sit in the relative peace of the bar. It's a good option for a pre-movie dinner at Mesa Riverpoint."}
{"text":"Love this place. Excellent Happy Hour. Excellent food. 

Usually get beer and rib tips and love the Wilbur sauce.

And the 'one rib' option is above and beyond. 

Famous Dave's has consistently catered to the guest and it shows. It's not easy being a BBQ restaurant, let alone a chain, and this location has been a great experience numerous times over the years.

Be back soon! Thank you!"}
{"text":"We love Famous Daves!  What's not to love about smoked meats and rolls of paper towels on the table!  The food is a good value.  Their pickles are amazing!  The dinner for two can be brought home as takeout and it will feed the family for $50 with leftovers."}
{"text":"4 Stars are for the BBQ.  Yummy.  Deducted 1 star for the staff.  Who the heck is in charge?  They sure aren't watching the staff texting and talking on their phones.  15 minutes for pickup food becomes 30 minutes.  People ordering potato salad and no one tells them they are out until they go to pay.  Thank goodness corn and potato wrapped in tin foil otherwise they would be cold.  Front register unmanned multiple times."}
{"text":"It's disappointing when you mess up barbecue. I really look forward to the fall off the bone tenderness of some good smoked ribs. This used to be my go to spot for several reasons but I'm crossing this off my list. The ribs here have gotten really bad. I ordered the big slab with an extra side of ribs and the ribs were super fatty and the quality of meat was terrible. The last time I checked ribs had a bone in the middle and they were supposed to fall off the bone. These ribs were nothing but fat and mushy.  I had to literally tear apart the meat to tear away at all the fat on the bone. The meal came with 2 sides and cornbread muffin. I got the baked beans and potato wedge fries. The baked beans were really good. Have a little spice with bits of meat. The wedge fries were fresh, big and full of potato. The muffin...not so much. It was hard and tasted like it was cooked 3 days ago. Muffins should be moist and tear apart so butter and honey can be smeared on it. I could have thrown this muffin at the a glass window and it would have shattered to pieces. 

I could have caught them on a bad night but I want some consistency. This is how you lose business. Quality is important. Don't cheap it out to save a couple bucks. You are better than this Dave! Please fix this."}
{"text":"It needs to be said that the area around Chandler Fashion Center is in dire need of a good locally owned joint.  However, left with no other choices yesterday, Famous Dave's knocked me off that soapbox for a couple hours.  All the chain components were there - building that looks like the Beverly Hillbillies' cabin, honkey-tonk music playing over the muzak, so much crap on the walls you could hardly see wall, cute pig sayings on staff t-shirts, merchandise table in front...you know the drill.  But the stuff on the walls was genuinely funny (my favorite being the neon pig with the letters M-E-A-T in neon underneath where the M would flash on and off so it would say EAT MEAT).  All the staff were both friendly and knew what they were doing - management clearly must not allow airheads.  Our server helped us through all the special deals they had going on, like the $5 frozen Jose Cuervo margarita and $1/$2/$3/$4 happy hour food (not on their website, but hh is 3-7).  Food came quick and was really, really good.  BBQ experts would probably call their BBQ \"pedestrian\"  (use of that word is a sure way to id a food snob BTW), but I had fun trying the 6 different sauces they had on the table for us (one is called Devil Spit - ha!).  It was a fun place that fed us tasty, fun tood, and we had fun interacting with their staff.  What more could you ask for?  Well...I was in pain the rest of the day, so would ideally like to see more gut-friendly options, but for heaven's sake it's a BBQ joint so I can deal with it once in a while."}
{"text":"Awful, awful service. Obviously the servers don't know their tables, the manager does not care. So many open tables so it's not that busy! Waiting for an hour for food to be served, crew walked back and forth including manager helping other customers, but nobody cared to check on us or at least say they are running behind. None! Service recovery at the end, they covered for our dinner. But we are paying customers, I will pay for what I ordered, but quality service is what I expect!"}
{"text":"When it's time for bbq we always come here their ribs are amazing and their array of sauces are delicious! The atmosphere is southern and the place is huge!"}
{"text":"I'm incredibly disappointed with my experience I just had with this restaurant. I called to place an order to go, was put on hold for 5 minutes and then hung up on. I called back because I figured I'd give them a chance to redeem themselves, but they obviously did not deserve it. When I spoke to the same girl and told her that I was hung up on, she did not even apologize but simply just said, \"ok what did you want to know?\" I said I wanted to order to go. She collected my info and was so rude that I finally just told her nevermind. I understand weekends are busy, but at least apologize for your mistake! Won't be giving them anymore chances."}
{"text":"WOW!  I finally ate here for the first time Saturday night, and was impressed with my experience here.  I have been wanting to try Famous Dave's for a while now, and finally got the chance to experience some wonderful food.  I am addicted to this place!

My friend Angie and I walked in on a Saturday night and were greeted immediately by the hostess.  I was also thrilled becuase there was no wait! We were seated immediately and offered drinks by the server.

Mind you, I have never been here before, so the menu was new to me.  We both took the time to review it, and the waitress also explained to us how to order.  They have meals for two with lots of food, entrees that are large as well, and also smaller sized meals (which I went with) that are more BBQ sandwiches of sorts, in case you don't feel like pigging out.  I really liked how they had big \"family meals\" with all the fixings.  Makes me think of a place back home in MI I used to eat at with my family when I was in college.

I went with the BBQ Brisket sandwich, and it was delicious!  It came with 1 side, and the roasted garlic potatoes.  Delicous!!!  YUMMY!  I devoured every morsel of it, and my friend liked her Brisket entree as well.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE how they have a HUGE selection of menu items! Chicken, brisket, beef, pork, everything a girl could dream up!

Service was marvelous, and food was worth every bite. I could never get sick of this place."}
{"text":"I love Famous Daves.  I really really do. This place is AMAZING!!! I LOVE IT HERE!!!!!!  Its good, consistant BBQ, and holds its own against other places in town that I have eaten at.  Full menu for any appetite-small medium OR large.  Food is consistantly good, and filling as well.

Audrey and I came here for lunch today, and it was delicous as always.  We were seated immediately, and pondered over the menu for a while.  I went with the BBQ Brisket lunch sandwich, and Audrey went with the fish sandwich.  Both dishes were tasty, and extremely filling!

I will say, even though I server was VERY nice and friendly, I was surprised at how slow she was with taking our orders, and our food took a while to come out. No points lost, just a side note.

Will gladly be returning for some of the best BBQ in town! I love ya Daves!"}
{"text":"I have been to famous Dave's before, just not this specific location.  I came here for my birthday dinner on Saturday night, and was glad that I did!

Upon entering, I was warmly greeted by the hostess.  I told her that my friend and I were here to celebrate my birthday, and she asked if we wanted to sit in the bar or at a table.  I chose the table of course!

Travis was our waiter for the evening.  I  belong to the Famous Dave's P.I.G. club, so I had a birthday coupon for buy one entree, get the second one for free.  I told him this, and he said that I also get a free dessert since its my birthday.  FTW! YES! Who doesn't love free dessert?!?!? I DO!!

Anyways, I went with the Brisket dinner, and my friend went with the 2 meat sampler. He got the BBQ'd chicken along with the sausage.  We both got corn on the cob, 2 sides each, (I went with the coleslaw and garlic mashed potato's) and my friend got something similar.

O, and the Brisket? Done PERFECTLY as always!  Juicy, tender, and o so delicious.

Anyways, Travis was really warm and friendly during the evening, and they brought out my ice cream with a flaming candle on top!!!! YES!! They even emailed me a photo!!  MY LIFE IS AWESOME!!! 

I love you Famous Dave's and will be back 10 million more times..."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for several years now and have a few favorites. I like that there are so many bbq sauce options and they are all right on the table for you to try. The service is usually great, the prices fair for how much food you get, and the place always looks clean. I really like the georgia copped pork platter and always have some to take home. It comes with two sides and I really love the baked apples. The only thing I am not a fan of are their ribs. My son in law however loves them so it is just a personal preference, not anything wrong with them. They have an email club and send coupons and specials regularly."}
{"text":"The bartender Cole is awesome and better than his predecessors Chenin, Tom , and Chelsea. And they were all AWESOME!!!!  Keep up the great work Famous Daves in hiring quality caring people with great food to boot. 

The the Pineapple Rage wings and the Cajun Chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Things have dropped off at Famous Dave's it seems. The concept and execution was so effective for so long, but quality and service seems to have suffered since my last visit some time ago. 

Our servers were super friendly but seemed very young and poorly trained. They didn't know the beer list and we had to request silverware. As for the food, I remember the ribs being better in the past. Tonight the meat seemed a bit tough and the taste seemed off too. My friend's hot links were a hit and sides were good. On a side note, the restroom was really messy. I can only hope this reflected our visit at the end of a busy day."}
{"text":"Chopped pork so good. The cornbread is also very good. The garlic mashed potatoes are outstanding. The corn on the cob is ok. The brisket is tender but a bit too smokey and dry for me. The ribs are very good.

The atmosphere leaves a bit to be desired. First it is a little too busy for my taste. The booths are too small. I am not a small guy but I am not huge either and I barely fit at all. 

I would stay away from the twisted tea it is not good. The special drinks look quite tasty but I have not indulged. The soda is properly carbonated and tasty.

The service was prompt and friendly.

It is a chain and I would not go here expecting to have the best BBQ you have ever eaten but it is upper middle class quality."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's is a typical corporate barbecue place - heavy on the barbecue sauce to cover up the otherwise tasteless selection of meats. On the plus side, the bar is nice and well stocked, but I wouldn't suggest going for the food."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's was a complete surprise. We ended up at Famous Dave's while looking for a quick dinner and finding all our usual haunts packed. I can't say anything about Famous Dave's BBQ, but the burgers we had were to die for; rich and juicy - on fresh buns - very tasty."}
{"text":"I WAS a FREQUENT visitor of this establishment. My last visit I witnessed a pretty good size COCKROACH strolling across the floor as I was enjoying my ribs. I know everyone gets a bug here and there BUT I have never seen the Manager of the restaurant, smash a cockroach, and smear it across the floor while people are eating lunch. He looked right at me after he did it and said NOTHING. The manager was a balled white guy, working at around 2pm on 4/18/17. Never going back."}
{"text":"We started with the small order of nachos!!
We got the pork on it... Delicious!
Our kids loved it too.
Kids ordered chicken fingers it includes drinks always a good deal.
I ordered the lunch special- 2 item combo with a side. Got the st louis ribs and hot links. Side grilled pinapple. Yummy!!
Husband ordered the pork and hot sausage. Delicious. Overall great lunch. Bill was $40 and with tip $48. Not bad for a sunday lunch."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Famous Dave's BBQ. We always go and get the feast for two. There's always a lot of leftovers and the food is perfect"}
{"text":"Good BBQ - ok service. would go again"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for good bbq. I don't frequent hear as it's really far to travel to this restaurant. I started noticed the consistency of the BBQ. Sometimes it's really good, sometimes, its gets dry on the ribs. 

I am a hard core carolina BBQ kind with the true pit BBQ where I can taste the meat and light seasoning. Sauce should be served on the side. My ideal kind of BBQ is like the The Big Bob Gibson BBQ in Alabama. Great ribs without the sauce.

Famous Dave takes on more of light Kansas and competition BBQ with light BBQ sauce on it. It's a great BBQ spot to go."}
{"text":"While visiting my girlfriend's family in Phoenix, AZ. Her father suggested we head over to Famous Dave's before we head out to continue our vacation to Flagstaff. The food here is amazing, you can tell the BBQ was home cooked and had been done so with some expert skill. We had wings, bone-in tips, burgers, fries. All of it was to die for. We also loved how they laid out all the sauces and explained which ones were which. I liked the rich and sassy so much that I bought a bottle in Walmart back home in San Diego. Only thing is that the restaurant was extremely packed and we had a larger group but were placed in a small booth that barley fit all of us. Other than that I wish I could go back today."}
{"text":"Simple and modest place. Delicious food. Simple menu. Great customer service in the store and online. Great loyalty rewards. Last time we went in we had the bread pudding w pecan sauce and ice cream. First dessert here! So delicious!"}

{"text":"Came here for dinner the food was ok not what it used to be... Our server was ok didnt know his name til the check was dropped... Overall my experience was below average from previous visits to this location."}
{"text":"Don't normally do reviews for chain restaurants but being out of state, I will.
I've eaten at a couple of Famous Dave's in California before and they were good meals but nothing great. 
Eating here was great not because of the food as much as the total experience. Service was good, Zack was are this evening. He took good care of our entire table, from a couple of beer samples, to menu suggestions and just being on call...nice.
All the food was good, we ordered the feast, totally enough for the four of us and left overs. 
Last words... I'd do it again."}
{"text":"This is for the Dells location which didn't come up on Yelp but I'm sure it would be the same review anyway...so would you think \"Devil's Spit\" BBQ sauce would be spicy? You'd be wrong here....no heat just endless sugar and salt...even the broccoli!"}
{"text":"I guess I'm late to the game.  After a tiring day, we were in the mood for some tasty meat, and were not in the mood to cook it at all.  This place came up on DoorDash instead of the BBQ place that we usually go to in Tempe--you know, the one on Baseline?

Well, no disrespect to that place on Baseline--we like it, but this place is quite a bit better.  I got a full rack of baby backs.  The ribs were absolutely delicious from first bite to last, as were the Wilbur Beans and cornbread.  My wife had the brisket, and was of exactly the same opinion--just fantastic.

We have found our new favorite BBQ joint.  We thought that our usual place would be hard to beat, but they did it, and won us over.  You do pay a little more here, but you're paying for quality, and you get it!"}
{"text":"I came here with my wife and 2 daughters and were seated quickly. The staff is very friendly and atmosphere is family oriented. We ordered the dinner for 2, and it was huge, it actually fed 4 with leftovers. We are definately coming back for more."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly atmosphere with great BBQ. I gotta tell you though, I always get their cheeseburger. I think it's in the top 5 burgers anywhere in the country. The spicy & sweet pickles and smoked bacon are just superb. You would be hard pressed to find a better burger anywhere. 

I usually get a side salad with it because their side salads are bigger and fresher than most places and they home-made ranch dressing is also among the best you'll ever have anywhere.

I also recommend the catfish fingers appetizer."}
{"text":"Best Barbeque in the West Valley.  For take out or dine in it can't be beat.  I just ordered 10 lbs  for an outdoor party .  I called 30 minutes ahead and they had my order ready and waiting when I arrived.
Being from the south I know good BBQ and this is the closest I had since moving to AZ.  It's much better than Old El Paso BBQ.
They also have really good shrimp!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a week day with my co-workers for a team lunch. I was really looking forward to this places and I love BBQ. When I first walk in you can really tell its a BBQ restaurant. Very county looking with cartoon pigs. Seems very inviting. 

They start you off with a bowl of bbq chips. Seemed like these were homemade cause each one was different shapes and sizes. Pretty good I must say. 

I had the lunch special brisket sandwich with a side of Mac and Cheese. They pile on a good portion of brisket and looked really good. They have so many different BBQ sauces at the table. I tried the Sweet & something (forgot the name) sauce. So I dumped a lot of sauce on it. Wasn't sure why but then realized the brisket looked a little too dry. I thought the brisket sandwich was okay. Not great. Could have been better  but good. The Mac & Cheese was okay. It had Jalapenos and corn in it. Nice little kick but not a lot of taste. Little disappointed cause I was expecting a little more from a bbq place. 

The service was really good. Welcomed us quickly and got our drinks out fairly quickly. We got our food pretty quickly for being a big party. They also cleaned off our dirty plates in a timely manner. So service was friendly and efficient. 

So overall, I thought the food was okay. I've tasted better. I thought Rudy's brisket is moister but I did like the choices of BBQ sauces. Loved their service. So if I had a craving for bbq would I come back. Maybe. It wouldn't be a bad choice but I would probably pick Rudy's over Dave's. Just a personal taste. Personal choice. If you do come here. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with 5 other people. It's a nice and lively place to dine at with a large party. Most of the tables were seated by family members or birthday parites...they're really accommodating to large parties. 

Their menu consists of a variety of BBQ (feasting) options. If you're vegetarian, I would suggest going somewhere else. Being as though they like to advertise the numerous awards they've received on their bbq's, I'd doubt you guys would even bother to come anyhow. 

I ordered the chicken wings off the appetizer because I wasn't too hungry. Got the mild spiciness level and it was perfect. The meat fell right off the bone and 8 pieces actually ended up being a little too much (shared them with others at the table). 
You can see pictures of what was devoured at our table. Nobody raved about how good their meal was, but definitely were more than full by the time we got up. Two people ordered the full stack of pork ribs though and they seemed to thoroughly enjoy it..don't know how they finished it...it's crazy big and comes with 2? 3 sides?? 

mac and cheese side comes with jalapenos and corn mixed in them. yummm and the mashed potato was good too. 

Service was okay, could've seen our waiter more but others working at the restaurant roam around to check up on how you're meal is going..even their mascot (fat pink pig) 

Only thing I must note: IceT the rapper and actor (Law and Order: SVU) was spotted dining with family as we were finishing up! omg it made me so happpy. I was staring at him smiling while he was walking from the restroom to his table...i swear he saw me and snuck a wave. Would've asked for a picture but didn't want to bother his precious time with family/friends. 

Big lot for parking, right by the Harkins Theater at Chandler mall."}
{"text":"We have visited a number of times, afternoons and evenings.  Always been seated right away in a booth.  I have always left full and with a big container for the next day.  The plater is the way to go.  Also, Happy Hour has really great and large sized drinks.  I enjoy it, and the location is great.  Always go to a movie afterwards."}
{"text":"Great Bar B Q!! Corn bread to die for along with Hot Links and ribs.  Sevice is great and reasonable price.  Bring family for special ocassion.  Nice outside patio during spring & fall season.  Great music selection!!!"}
{"text":"I love when a restaurant has unique items.  We ordered the burnt ends as an appy, and they were melt in your mouth good.  I loved that it arrived with spicy sweet pickles, an onion slaw and BBQ potato chips.  A great touch.

I ordered the BBQ Chicken Salad.. I know.. who does that?  But I love salad, and it was a winner.  My husband had the chicken dinner and it was delish."}
{"text":"Kids chicken tenders and fries drenched in grease. sandwiches are significantly smaller, the boneless wings were a joke and the muffins were undercooked. We have eaten at here for years. They have changed a lot over the years and This is the worst. Our dinner was a waist of time and money. We will not be back, too many other choices with far better food."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday and it was so good I am still thinking about it. I had the grilled shrimp and St. Louis ribs and they were excellent. The wait staff were very warm and friendly and the manager stopped by our table to make sure everything was okay. The shrimp was very tasty while the ribs were out of this world. The garlic mashed potatoes were good along with the corn on the cob. My iced tea was very crisp and refreshing. My fellow guests loved their food. I even had enough to take home.  All of this for a decent price. I left very happy."}
{"text":"-MOST tender brisket I've EVER had! Brisket was very tender and full of smokey flavor (even w/o sauce!)

-Chopped pork was very flavorful and juicy!

-Mashed red skin potatoes were creamy and so YUMMY! (I could had eaten a bucket of this stuff!)

-Potato salad was ok...(nothing special, it was like grocery store deli potato salad...)

-Green Beans were tender with a hint of spiciness...

-Cole Slaw was tangy and sweet...just right!

-Service was friendly!

-Fun ambience! 

-Reasonable prices! Good portions!

-Separate entrance for To-Go orders."}
{"text":"I came out to Famous Daves a couple days ago all the way from California!!! I was craving their brisket baked potato. (Ok I didn't drive all the way there just to eat, I was visiting family) our server Taylor was phenomenal, she was so sweet and we felt so welcomed. Our 4 year old was with us and usually going out with a toddler is the hardest, but Taylor made her feel very good by paying attention to her and giving her a balloon. She even told us about a way we could get a free desert next time we come in since we didn't have room in our stomachs to try the amazing banana pudding she raved about! Oh yeah the brisket was amazing as always. Will be back"}
{"text":"Why am I so obsessed with Famous Daves? Trust me--my family asks me that all the time. I'm from Fairview so this particular Famous Dave's was not far away growing up. I've lived in Columbus for over ten years now and pretty much every time I come home, I have to go to Famous Dave's. My absolute favorite dish (which I never stray away from) is the cedar plank salmon. They even took it off the menu at one point but I'd still ask for it and they'd make it for me, which I really appreciate. I'm also very picky with my BBQ sauces but I must admit that the Rich & Sassy is one of my favorite sauces of any brand! I always add it on top of my salmon (which I know sounds insane, but try it sometime) I also dip my fries in it! The corn bread is always a delicious add on and I also love the wedge potato fries (not enough restaurants have wedge fries!) Famous Dave's is definitely one of my faves of any chain and this particular one is near and dear to my heart. I just hope it never closes down or else then I'll have to go to Michigan or Kentucky for my cedar plank salmon!"}
{"text":"We are not in Memphis, Texas, Alabama, Georgia or Kansas City..... we are in Phoenix, Tempe, Mesa...... so the expectations are simply  cleanliness, friendliness, value, and halfway decent BBQ.....

(and this is a chain restaurant in a giant shopping center)...

ok, having said all that: 
I had the pulled pork sandwich with a couple of sides, slaw & mac/cheese....

The pork was good, the sauce was good, the bun was good, the sides we about what I expected....... the place is clean & the service was quick & friendly..........

what else can you say...except this place is 10x better than Lucille's 

will be back ...Duke..."}
{"text":"The roast chicken was amazing. So much flavor. Chopped pork was good, a little fatty which was hard to eat around in the dim light.  Cole slaw had a bad after taste which is disappointing because it tastes so good at first. Couldnt eat the mac n cheese. I saw the spicy sign but forgot to ask what was in it. I think it was jalapeño, because I started having an allergic reaction shortly after, but it was okay. Kinda tasted like nacho cheese on noodles. The mustard sauce is bomb! If I come back I think I'll try the brisket with garlic mashed potatoes and wilbur beans. Oh and the cornbread muffins are fantastic, flavorful and very moist. Staff was excellent as well.

I should also mention I'm from Virginia and North Carolina so I know good bbq, and this place is great for a franchise."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! Their happy hour is awesome! I love all the different sauces, and their meats always turn out perfect. The customer service has always been great everyone I'm there. I recommend this place to anyone craving good bbq!"}
{"text":"This is our Famous Dave's. We come here every few months.

We have yet to have a bad experience here. The service is always good. The meat is awesome; our faves include the brisket, the sausage, the chopped pork, and of course the ribs. My husband likes the Devil's Spit and Wilbur's Revenge sauces. Me, I'm fine with any of their tame BBQ sauces. The corn bread muffins are a particular weakness of mine.

Our son is autistic. Famous Dave's is his favorite restaurant because of the large glowing clock on the main dining room wall, and he loves their BBQ chips.

Another weakness of mine: bread pudding. I've only had their mini version, but it was excellent.

My husband likes the beers they have on tap, which usually includes seasonals from companies like Sam Adams or Leinenkugel ."}
{"text":"Awful service!  The individual in charge of pick-up ( for my sons graduation party) was completely unprofessional and rude.  They did not have my order ready like they said they would, the man w the glass eye was so condescending and did NOTHING to assure to correct the problem
   I asked for a refund and he said NO!   What assistant manager speaks to a paying long time customer like that.  Needless to say I have had This place  cater several functions for me but never ever again!   You can guarantee I will follow up w management and regional with this !"}
{"text":"Ordered pick up. St Louis style full rack with broccoli and loaded mashed potatoes. Love the devils spit hot bbq sauce. Best tasting ribs!"}
{"text":"For the last three times we have it has taken forever!  We are talking 45+ per time to get our food.  One time we were there over an hour, luckily our kids were well behaved.  The food is decent, every time we go it seems as if the back of the house does not have their act together."}
{"text":"I don't eat pork at all and that's their specialty, hahah, it was soo funny, cause the host said something like \"have a porkstastic day\" and I looked at him like he was crazy

we ordered beef brisket, and appetizer sampler. They have good catfish. Good food actually. corn was soo juicy and the corn bread was yummy too

they have 4 different bbq sauces on every table and I like their paper napkins on a roll"}
{"text":"Gotta say that the food here was not very good at all.  From the main meats to the side dishes--utterly forgettable.  The only thing enjoyable was the beer.  Had the beef brisket, pork ribs and catfish fingers.  All were too salty and the beef/pork seemed fresh--as in freshly microwaved.  We chose 4 different sides and none were good.  Will never come back even though the service and decor were nice."}
{"text":"I love this place, The food is great and the service is always good there. I love all the different varieties of barbecue sauces."}
{"text":"One of my favorite briskets place. If my taste buds serve me right its better than those I used to dine in texas. 

The spicy source from the kitchen is a little too much. At an instant tasting the very hot source, I hick up not stop for a minute before I can continue with my burger. Devil spit or even the milder texas spit is good enough. And texas spit definitely wont kill your taste buds just dont go crazily dipping the source"}
{"text":"My daughter and I have been to Famous Dave's many times since my first review.  This last time we went, our server was again pleasant and on the money with reccomendations.  My daughter is addicted to the roasted chicken.  She cleans it down to the bone every time!  And their bread pudding is sooooo good!  It's rich so beware.  Do not order the full on dessert, instead try the smaller version.  It is just right.  Another great thing about Famous Daves, one of the servers that we had about 6 months ago, Kristen, remembered us!  Now that is customer service!  Thanks Dave!!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times,and I always liked it. I love BBQ so you don't have to twist my arm to go. The pork and the brisket are both really good. I like the side cornbread muffin,too. I don't usually eat that,but there I do. The burnt ends are really good,too. They used to have a good brisket burger that was one of the best,but stopped carrying it-that is a big mistake.  Last time I ate here,it was a little bit 'seedy' feeling in the bar,because it was a bit dirty,and the waiter/barman wasn't very attentive. That was not my best experience. But any other time before I have really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"\"Loved.it!!''  Great service! And food!!  New place for friends and family!!  Before a game, after.a game before or after movie.  Love the BBQ!!"}
{"text":"I always get great food and fast service at Dave's.   I have not found better bar-b-que in local Chandler area.    I recommend the Texas Pit BBQ sauce, but my family loves that you get multiple sauce choices.   The cornbread is awesome, and we always get the famous breadpudding (I tell people who claim they don't like breadpudding that they cannot be sure they don't like breadpudding until they try Dave's as it is the best)."}
{"text":"This is going to be a long one - my son turned 11 yesterday - this is where he chose to go for his birthday dinner. In total was 25 people - in which half of them where from out town - made a trip to az to spend my sons birthday together. We got there at 6 ... no reservations which is totally fine we all got there at one time and where seated within 10 minutes easy .... from there it went completely down hill excruciating slow. 1st - they didn't seat us all together we were in separate tables which was really hard because this was also the first meeting of two different families. BUT I understand it was a large party- I get it. 
Right off the bat we said separate checks (4 to be exact as we did it by family ) she said no it will be one check - I said NO it will be separate checks. 
Next - we literally waited over 25 minutes for them to take our order ... they where so disorganized and all over the place that it was 25 minutes later when we discovered that they never took the kids table order ... we ordered an appetizer and it took an additional 40 minutes ... so they brought us extra nachos for each table ... oh big deal ... at this point 1 hour and 30 minutes later the kids are getting really cranky and the adults are loosing patience ... I inquire with the waitress what is taking so long she stated they where busy ... I counted there was 9 tables ... I said you aren't that busy she said yes we are and I said no ... she said ok and walked away .. fine ... your busy .... another 30 minutes go by now I have watched three tables come in get seated order eat and leave ... no food yet ... I walk up to the manager interrupted another customer complaining to her ... and said basically I was really an embarrassed hostess to this party and where is our food !!! She said it's on its way ...  15 minutes later it came ... the food here is good we ate ( we where starving ) everyone was happy with the food once we got it ... ohhhh now the bill :.. we waited ANOTHER 35 minutes for the bills !!!! At this point some of us took the kids to the cars and we waited ... asked for the bill then waited ... it was over a $300 bill ... she gave us 75 off ... if I had not have had a party of 25 I would have just left ... totally embarrassed ... and had to cancel our next stop on this birthday night ... none of us will be going back. It was all handled very wrong .. and basically ruined my night ..all in all we where there for 3 1/2 hours !!!! Terrible !!"}
{"text":"Famous Dave's catered my wedding and the food was delicious. The event coordinator was able to help me put together something that was within my budget. I had two main entrees, two sides, and cornbread. The only issue I had was the portion of the food served. We ran out of the entrees before the sides. When it came down to it, I had a bunch of beans left over. Not bad, but some of my guests were left a little hungry. All in all, affordable catering, nice and friendly staff, and DELICIOUS food!"}
{"text":"We were sat close to the bar but tucked out of the way. The problem with that was we were forgot about just as a table near us was left dirty during most our visit, 3 servers walked over food on the floor near our table, our server seldom came to our table, we had someone else bring our food. I'm pretty disappointed in this location. I do enjoy the location in Lake Delton and Wisconsin Dells. I will never frequent this location again."}
{"text":"We had the American Feast & it was great. I will definitely be back. I'm so stuffed, I have tried other BBQ places since we have moved to Arizona this is definitely  to the go to place."}
{"text":"Oh I love my Famous Dave's... they make turning \"older\" fun... and the Sunday Fried Chicken is soooooo good... the staff is always fun and attentive to your every need... thank you guys for being MY FAMOUS DAVE'S."}
{"text":"I hate chain barBQ but if you have to go to a chain .....Famous Dave's is the only one. 
Typically the St Louis ribs are better than average ......
The beef brisket is better than average, as well.
The fish appetizer is pretty good, as well.
The chicken was tender but had something in it that I didn't like.

The cornbread is good ...
String beans .....nahhhhh!

Service was not good. It took 35 mins to be served. I was getting ready to leave when the manager delivered my plate. That is entirely too long to be served .....


I'll give them another try when I'm in the area and a hunkering for some St Louis ribs! If the service doesn't improve - it'll be my last visit."}
{"text":"Having a barbecue restaurant can be a little tricky especially when there so many different types and styles of that people like their barbecue. Some people like dry rub some people like it wet some people like only certain cuts,  some people like smoked... etc. Famous Dave's is a chain restaurant that does a pretty good job but it's not always consistent. The available sauce are 'ok' but if you like the sauces then putting it with your food will then compliment it. 

One of the things I did enjoy is their lunch specials.  In particular you can get one or two meat items along with the side for a reasonable amount of money & the food comes out pretty quick. 

Quick was the main reason that brought me in today for lunch and everything I described was exactly as expected. I wanted some baby back ribs but those were not part of the lunch special so instead I went for the brisket and tried something new with the catfish fingers which are lightly fried with some dipping sauce. The brisket was good soft & tender (I had some chunks of fat that could of been removed prior to serving) & The cat fish fingers had some flavor. I'm not a big fan of the barbecue sauces but you kind of make them work depending on your mood.

I decided to sit in the bar area and watch a little bit of the Masters tournament and the service was great. Would definitely come back for lunch as I like the service, speed, & price... but looking for more consistency."}
{"text":"Service was good (two stars) but the food was horrible. Do not order the chili or the Mac and cheese. I'm pretty E sure they have huge pots of their sides that sit there all day. Food lacks flavor and meat was dry. This place feels like fast food joint. Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"So my son is quickly becoming a BBQ enthusiast. So when we drove by this place he gave me the puppy dog eyes and we pulled in. There on line club gives you a free sandwich or burger, and the portion size of that is amazing. I also ordered the feast for one, which was $20. It was huge. We ended up taking a ton of food home with us. The chicken quarter was flavorful and not dry at all. The ribs are very good, the pulled pork was what you would expect. The Texas brisket was a bit dry for me. They have several sauces to pick from and if it's your first time they will come by and tell you a bit about each- it would be great if they would add a true Carolina gold and a sweet Tennessee sauce. The decor is great and I love the sink in the middle of the dining area to wash your hands."}
{"text":"So this will be my 2nd Famous Dave's review - this time we lunched at the San Tan Valley location- we walked in at noon and were seated right away. The restaurant of course had the trademark Famous Dave's decor which provides much to look at. Upscale bbq casual - our waitress Shawna was very friendly - she painted a pig in bbq sauce on a plate for us, and made suggestions on the menu. The food came out and it was every carnivores dream, jalapeño bacon on top of pulled pork on top on a hamburger patty. My sons eyes sparked with delight when he took his first bite - and then there was silence from him for at least 5 minutes ( very rare for a 12 year old boy) my pulled pork sandwich was also very good. The quality of the bun was unexpected but appreciated. We will be back! Lots more to taste here!"}
{"text":"Was here on Saturday evening with a friend.  
Very nice friendly service and atmosphere.  
We ordered the feast for two, which was $35.  Not bad it had 4 sides,  potato wedges, corn on cob, cole slaw, and beans.  Also it came with 2 corn muffins.  There was as far as meat, a half slab of ribs, half a smoked or roasted chicken, and sliced beef brisket.  There was about 5 sauces in which to choose from for the meat.
All was very good except for the ribs.  They were very dry and crusty.  It was not edible at all, what little meat I did manage to taste had a good flavor.  After bringing to servers attention, he did bring me 3 to 4 bones of fresh ribs.  I say meat in that condition, for that price should not have been served in the 1st place.  They need to keep the meat in a slight steamer, to hold in tenderness.
I can say the brisket was very good and melted in the mouth.  The chicken, I have no complaints.  The sides all had good flavor, and excellent. 
I told my friend we could have good to Smokey Bones for better quality food at about half the price, I even had coupons.  I hope the next time I am in Cleveland and try this place again, the ribs served will be better quality."}
{"text":"I know it is a chain, but I am hard pressed to find better barbecue in Phoenix. The rib tips are among the best I have ever tasted. The brisket and ribs are also good. The hot links are good, but not as wonderful as the other stuff. I buy their sauces for home and go through Devil Spit like water. 

Service is always good too. They also do a great job at catering. They handled food at an event I recently coordinated and they handled 200 plus people very efficiently. 

I highly recommend Famous Dave's to anyone who likes barbecue. There is better at certain mom and pop places in the South, but again, I put it up against anything in Phoenix--even Joe's in Gilbert."}
{"text":"I was drawn to this place by my nose. If you have walked around Santan Mall you know what smell I am talking about. Sweet bbq smell, it drew me in. The place is fun and casual. The prices are good and their is a lot of variety on the menu. I shared a two meat combo with my bf. They brought out the wrong order for us, but I caught it and they brought the right order. The food was good especially the potatoes. Nothing was too special though and I doubt I will come back. The service from the people who took our names down to the waitress were eh-ok."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place of allllll time. I love their pulled pork barbeque (Georgia Pulled Pork). Food size is great and filling, definatly a lot of ffod for the price. Would recommend for anyone who loves barbeque!"}
{"text":"Delicious and a great casual atmosphere. Make sure you bring your appetite or a doggie bag, because portion sizes are GENEROUS! The staff is friendly and very informative, and the food is outstandingly good. Great for older kids (10 yrs old and up). There are vegetarian options too!"}
{"text":"Slow service but the food was great. Brisket plate and half slab of ribs....baked beans, mashed potatoes, coleslaw and corn muffins were all excellent!!!!!  People mention the price is too high, I felt it was a good price for the volume of food we got. 

Called in for take out...was told that it would be ready in 10-15 minutes.  30 minutes later the food came out.  Small trade for the dinner they provided.."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here to eat when I want to splurge and break my diet a little.  Yesterday my wife and I had lunch here and I splurged on the individual feast for $19.99 which included pulled pork, 3 ribs and barbecue chicken with wilbur beans, corn, slaw and a corn muffin.  It filled me up and I brought the chicken home with me.  My wife had a 2-meat lunch special and brought half her meal home also.

What I like most about Famous Dave's is the 5 different varieties of barbecue sauces.  Most barbecue places have 1 sauce.  I really like to try the different types on different parts of my meal."}
{"text":"Went to Famous Dave's to get some BBQ for Father's Day to go. It was absolutely slammed. I arrived when my order said it would be ready online and I waited over another 1/2 hour. I know it was busy, but I would have preferred spending that time with my family. 

When I got our order Home it was missing a side, which was a bit annoying. But with understanding how busy it was, I didn't call back, but plan to. The boxes were also covered in bbq sauce. I mean covered. I wash my hands at least 3 times before dinner just from touching the boxes. Again, probably because they were slammed.

On to the food...

Wilbur beans - just okay. A bit too runny.

Mac and cheese - had a bit more of a jalapeño kick than I was excepting. Good flavor though.

Mashed potatoes - too garlicky and tasted like they were out of a box.

Fries - no flavor. 

Sandwich - okay, but not much bbq flavor to be found."}
{"text":"Eh. 

Food is pretty good! 

Shitty service & loud in the cafeteria area, 
Bar was nicer but we moved seats twice which is inconvenient. 

It's: eh"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!!! Delicious! The BBQ chicken sandwich was fantastic! Also, the onion straws with the remoulade sauce were amazing! Soooo good! Large portions, decent prices, friendly service, and a quirky decor. Overall a fantastic restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Good place to take the kids... they love the gal in the pig costume walking around. Service is friendly and snappy, the food is pretty decent for BBQ. The Pork Ribs or the Jalapeno Burger are probably the best things on the menu.

Nothing amazing about this chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Always love eating here. The food is great. My favorite items have to be the fried catfish and rib tips. The BBQ sauces are delicious and go well with all of the meats. The Mac and cheese and salmon are also very good. The atmosphere is good, and the staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I client call me today and wanted to take me out to lunch . . . I suggested BBQ since I hadn't had any in a while . . . and she suggested Famous Dave's.

We were greeted promptly and seated quickly . . . our waitress took our drink order and returned with our drinks and to take our orders . . . I ordered the Stuffed Baked Potato with Georgia Chopped Pork . . .  and she the Meat Sampler appetizer.

First, the iced tea was cloudy and tasted a little on the funky side . . . Second, the chips had a burnt taste to them and even the sauces did not make it go away . . . Third, my potato was good, but could have used more pork and the big piece of fat in the middle was not very appetizing, although my client loved hers.

I have been to other Famous Dave's and have had awesome experiences . . . this one however . . . was not thing special . . . I will probably visit Famous Dave's again . . . just probably won't be this location . . ."}
{"text":"Best chain bbq I can think of. The food is better than average and the portions are huge. Just ordered the American Family Feast which advertises that it feeds 4 to 6 people.  It easily feeds eight. Great value and fast pick up service."}
{"text":"Location & Aesthetics - Located in Peoria opposite from the Peoria Sports Complex and nestled between the Cheesecake Factory and The Elephant Bar.  
Parking is plentiful.  
The restaurant is clean, very spacious, and well lit. 

Menu - 3 was brought to the table - drinks, main, and lunch menu all easy to understand.

Service - Staff was super friendly and helped answer any questions we had.  

Food - I ordered The Big Slab with Wilbur beans, creamy coleslaw which comes with a corn bread muffin.  
Creamy coleslaw was indeed creamy and fresh.  It wasn't watery or warm.  The Wilbur beans had a little kick to it but not too much and was well seasoned and just the right temperature.
The ribs was tender and juicy with lots of ample sauce.  It wasn't too tender where it was falling off the bone but well cooked and well smoked as well.  It tasted as if it had been smoked for some time as that flavor was down to the bone!

Will most definitely be returning to try many of their other items on the menu and to also try their to-go service!"}
{"text":"We love this location, and get takeout here pretty regularly. Everybody is always very friendly and helpful, and I have personally never had a bad experience or meal. 
We took a friend here for dinner a while back, and he was upset that his rib tips were fatty. He had never had them before, and he didn't understand (even though I warned him) that's what rib tips are supposed to be. Anyway, instead of brushing him off, the managers replaced his meal with something else without missing a beat. They made sure he was happy with his meal. I was impressed."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great, excellent service.  Ribs were over cooked, burnt ends were tasty but a lot of pure fat pieces (supposed to trim some of that fat boys and girls).  Good mix of different sauces.  And I do not care what anyone says you DO NOT put f*cking corn in Mac 'N Cheese, pure cardinal sin.  Beans were somewhat lack luster too.  Good for a BBQ quick fix, but nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Famous Dave's, but we ate there last night and the food was not up to par. I'm not sure if they changed their recipes or methods, but something was off. I could only take two bites of the coleslaw because it had a weird chemical quality to it, and the chopped pork was way too salty. The grilled pineapple tasted like the grill grate in my backyard. It was really disappointing."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and Not only had they skipped us on the wait, the server came to drop our drinks and drop the check, that was it, it was horrible but the food was GREAT! A host named Christine actually helped us out more ."}
{"text":"I was right across the street at Riverview Toyota getting my car serviced so I decided to stop in for a bite. They have happy hour all day with $2 off beer $3 well drinks half off all appetizers. I decided sided to get there nachos with BBQ brisket and a will drink. The nachos taste fantastic in the presentation was very well. The only thing I didn't like was how long the lettuce trip sperm it was hard to eat them I had to cut them up with a knife which is hard to do with nachos. My waiter was very attentive and friendly overall I had a pretty good experience. My only suggestion would be to Tropic the lettuce that you put on the nachos that way it makes it a lot easier to eat"}
{"text":"We took the in-laws back to Famous Dave's, but this time, we were seated immediately.  The last time we tried to visit Famous Dave's it was an hour wait, so we went to Smokey Bones instead.

Anyway, we ordered the All-American BBQ Feast again.  And again, it was superb!  It includes a full slab of St. Louis-style spareribs, a whole chicken, 1/2 lb. of either Texas beef brisket or Georgia chopped pork, coleslaw, Famous Fries, Wilbur Beans, four corn-on-the-cob, and four corn bread muffins.  We opted for the Texas beef brisket, which was off the hook.  It was a lot of food, but we brought helpers.

I will never order anything else at this restaurant because the All-American is soooo good.

Get yours!"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that I love Famous Dave's. I have a great experience at my usual location. This is my first time trying this one; and it started out terribly. I was quickly seated .... then ignored. The only way I was able to get service after around 15 minutes was to hunt down a waitress and ask for help. This is not what I expect from this restaurant. 

I was about to give a one star review, although it was saved by our waitress, who was awesome. So good in fact that I gave a 50% tip. She was the best part of our experience there. The rest of the staff however, leaves little to be desired."}
{"text":"Great chain BBQ joint. I usually get ribs or rib tips. Every 4th or 5th time the rip tips can be a little tough, but nothing major. Prices are not too bad for a BBQ joint. Since great BBQ is hard to find, it is nice to have Dave's to fall back on."}
{"text":"All that I can say is get the trash can lid full of food you get all your favorites plus corn fries and slaw.  The Brisket here is awesome!  The ribs are very good! Not as big as shanes BBQ but still good.  The smell alone is enough to make you hungry!  The service is pretty good, drinks are overpriced but that seems to be the new standard nowadays.  The Portion size is huge.  You will be taking some home.  My favorite is the RIb Tips.  You get three times more rib meat and half the price of a rack.  You will not be disappointed.  This place is not for calorie watchers.   The sauces are awesome too."}
{"text":"We passed on the cheesecake factory next door to eat here?!? 

First off, there was no line out front so,I figured we could get seated quickly. I was right, but we sat and sat and sat waiting on the server. Finally got our drinks ordered and we were told that they would bring chips to the table. They could've kept those...

Placed our food order and still waiting... This food better be good cause I'm not impressed so far."}
{"text":"Good food; okay service. I have been going here for many years now and love their BBQ."}
{"text":"I was wary when I saw the standard chain-restaurant interior, but - man - this food was delicious. I grew up in Georgia, so I have a near-constant craving for corn bread and smoked pork products, and this place hit the spot. I had the rib tips (literally, the fatty tips of the ribs that are cut off from the rib slabs), which the server recommended: they were juicy and, importantly, the dry rub was *very* flavorful. (flavorful bbq meat is hard to find; usually, it's all smoked out and dry, and I have to douse it in bbq sauce to make it edible)
The sides weren't large, but they, too, were flavorful and distinctive. I had the mac 'n cheese with jalepenos, and baked beans - all of the food is pleasantly spicy.

For serving great BBQ in CLE, this place gets 5 stars. I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this location a couple times, but I honestly never seem to remember it exists until I'm really looking for barbecue. Went in a few nights ago and ordered some burnt ends, and a  \"feast\". The feast is good if you have a few people and want to sample a lot of things. The fries were pretty decent, the beans were excellent as was the coleslaw. The ribs and brisket were also really good but that's all I tried. Some locations are hit or miss but the couple of times I've been here it's been good and I'll probably stick to this location. Our server was also great and she was fast on clearing debris and keeping our refills coming."}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ restaurant. I highly recommend the full slab of baby back ribs, with beans and mac on the side. Truly amazing."}
{"text":"OK, I have seen this place many times at Chandler Mall. I finally decided to give this place a try. To my surprise the food was quite good, pleasant atmosphere even during a busy lunch. I enjoyed the shredded pork more so that the beef brisket. All in all, a pretty good place for BBQ around Chandler Mall."}
{"text":"This was a horrible experience, we got in and it was not busy we were seated and proceeded to wait as the hostess instructed us that the server would be right with us. 10 minutes later and still no one to ask if we wanted drinks let alone for them to know they would be right with us.

We decided to wait a little longer and a couple that came in after us were waited on nearly right away . 20 minutes past and still no one came to ask for our orders or drinks. I was the only colored person in the restaurant and everyone else was Caucasian those who came in after my girlfriend and I were waited on and orders taken.

Will never go to another famous daves"}
{"text":"Have been here several times and always had very good service and yummy food. Went there today for lunch and the service was sloooooow. Both the server and manager acknowledged the wait, apologized and also gave us a free dessert. Very nice! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Have been coming for a couple months all the sudden they changed happy hour in always order rib tips they are always amazing when I acted confused cause they now had fries she acted put out and like I was an idiot. Tom usually waits on me and he is awesome. Next time I will make sure I ask for him. Cause they have some servers who do not live up to the famous label"}
{"text":"There is a magic hour for BBQ, and if you happen to show up during that time, you will be wowed and amazed with delicious and moist sliced Texas brisket.  Some times the product is absolutely better than others.  I went around 5pm yesterday, and it was sheer perfection.

The Texas brisket plate comes with sliced brisket atop a slice of white bread, 2 sides of your choosing, and a corn muffin which I am not fond of.  zTejas makes my favorite corn bread, served in a skillet with sweet butter.

The sides I like are cob corn and grilled pineapple steaks.  The broccoli is pretty good too, as is the wilbur beans, which have scraps of brisket in them (not vegetarian)

I've tried one of the desserts, their Dave's Famous Bread Pudding, and it is spectacular, with a praline sauce pecans beg to float in, golden raisins, an oversized mound of sweet whipped cream and a large scoop of vanilla ice cream.  If you want to get this $6.49 dessert for free, simply take the survey on your receipt, write down the code, and bring it back with you on your return visit."}
{"text":"Thursday night, two adults, two children [although the boys order from the regular menu], seated promptly, with short wait until Alexis arrived to check our drink orders.  All four ordered some form of the ribs plus meat combo, with varying sides.  The order came in two pieces and in a reasonable time.  Less than satisfactory were the baby back ribs and the tips; the others items were OK.  The meat portions are adequate, as are the side of potatoes; the beans and slaw in cups are minimal.  We've eaten in Dave's elsewhere and this property falls slightly below the average."}
{"text":"Do not recommend this location. Writing this as I wait for a server. Took over 15 mins for a server, prior to the hostess sitting another couple and skipping over us."}
{"text":"Worst dinner and service ever. Very disappointed
Seems this is how is was the last couple times.
 Even the Manager did a drive by \"everything ok\"? 
Didn't miss a step blowing by the table."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's has always been my go-to place for a birthday meal, and often in between birthdays.  But this last time it was different.  Only two bbq sauce choices on each table, no butter for corn or muffins, no wet-nap for clean up.  And the portions were smaller.  After spending $30-40 on a meal for two what you don't want is to leave still feeling peckish.  It really felt like they were trying to cheap out on everything.  It's a shame, because previously I'd always been completely satisfied.  Still friendly wait staff, but next year I'm going to look around."}
{"text":"The dinner catfish came with two sides. I picked the chili and mac and cheese. I didn't know the chili was an extra $1.75 the meal itself was $14.99 and sweet iced tea was $1.99

All for one meal is quite pricey! Over $22 plus tip and tax

The food is always great, but it's surprisingly a lot for just one person to eat. 

Good food, but don't expect to pay under $10 a person."}
{"text":"Solid all around BBQ joint. Great deals for Happy Hour. Skip the catfish."}
{"text":"What else can I say about their catering department other than IT IS AWESOME!!!! From the beginning of the process of getting quotes and ordering the food, to the actual event, the whole experience was easy. Our event was yesterday and Kimberly did an excellent job setting up, serving, and taking it all down. The food was delicious!!! We got the BBQ Blow out and it is definitely worth the price. Go for the full service like we did and they will do everything for you making it easy for you to enjoy your event. Thank you Famous Dave's for making my boyfriend's birthday extra special."}
{"text":"So have you had the Merca family dinner cause I have and I have few tips for ya. The brisket was a bit dry but if beans are your things dip the brisket if not go with the chopped pork. The corn bread on point for sure as was the rest it was all great. The one thing I did that I would not get again is the brownie but that's just me. Call it in and is done in less than 20."}
{"text":"Ultimate Burger,,, enough said !

best lunch location in the area, hands down best burger with this style,,, 
yes, their other food is great also, i just like the burger that much more,,, Filling great price... the goto decision while there."}
{"text":"I would give them a negative 5 stars.  Made a reservation for a party of 16, called the day before and the day of to confirm.  Called the day of at 7:11pm to let them know we will be there between 7:30-7:45 pm.  Get here and they tell me they don't take reservations and had to wait 30 mins as they seat a party of 9, a party of 7, and another party of 6.  Update our waiters made everything better, Danny was up beat, funny, and friendly.  The manager took care of us and apologized many times."}
{"text":"OMG love this place Virginia is the best bartender!

Don't listen to the negative comments the food is wonderful!"}
{"text":"When I smell Famous Dave's, I automatically start drooling. After eating Famous Dave's, I feel like I might have been drooling for barbecue in general. This specific location was okay, I was greeted by bored and slow hostesses and it wasn't busy on a Saturday evening which was surprising. Our server was fantastic though, very attentive and kind, but the food was just...okay. The chips they brought out as a waiting snack were so salty my gums were literally numb after having a few, not sure what that was about, and the main course was nothing special. I can see why people might like this place as it caters to that down south type of ambiance that People crave to go along with their ribs, but the food didn't match. There was no kick and no oomph, it was just meat and taters."}
{"text":"We went to the Mesa location (on Dobson) last evening and for the first time, ever.. the ribs were awful.  They were overcooked, dry and honestly very tasteless.  We didn't get there late or even during a busy time.  Just 5:30 on a Sunday evening and nothing served was what we have become accustomed to getting at Dave's.  Typically, we go to the Chandler location and we will continue that."}
{"text":"Wow!  Nous avons pris une assiette de viandes pour deux.  Nous n'avons pas été capable de la finir.  Nous aurions pu la partager avec une troisième personne.  La brisquette et les côtes levées étaient savoureuses.  Je conseille la brisquette plutôt que le porc effiloché."}
{"text":"First and foremost I will start by saying my favorite food in the world is BBQ ribs!  I went here yesterday for my birthday lunch to have just that,  I ordered tge chilli for starters which was pretty decent,  but a little heavy on the sour cream and lacking in the meat department. I ordered the baby back ribs of course for my entree with the mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.  I am a fan of all style of ribs,  however these ribs where not the best and not the worst, but could certainly be better.  I understand there not \"fall off the bone ribs\"  but they were tougher than most steaks I've had.  I am a fan of this place and will return for other menu items, but the ribs need some extra love for sure."}
{"text":"Almost a 5er here. The ribs are that good. They are definitly the best part. I do recommend the baby back ribs. They are slightly dry but not too much, almost perfect with no extra sauce, they do offer like 5 different BBQ sauces to use. This visit we tried the fried cod appetizer which was quite tasty with a tangy dipping sauce. One thing that Id like to note about this particular visit is that Famous Daves was very accommodating to late diners, we along with some other tables came in close to closing time, but the staff was happy to serve us and we never felt rushed. 

If there beer came in cold (frozen) glasses they might have gotten a coveted 5 star review from me."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner tonight it was our first time being here everything was great food,service,and the prices and we will be returning soon"}
{"text":"Amazing food once our server got around to asking us for our order. The female server didn't come back around so we were served by Jeremy and he was awesome. I recommend the BBQ nachos with briskett. And love taking home left overs because the feast for 2 really can feed 4!!"}
{"text":"We had some friends coming over to visit on Saturday and and the temperature was a little too high outside for a cookout so instead we decided to call in for pick up from Famous Daves.

We purchased the All American BBQ Feast, which feed 4 Adults, and 2 children. In the feast included Tasty BBQ ribs, chicken, fries, wilbur beans, cornbread muffins, and potato salad.  I like famous Daves because of their consistency, quality of good BBQ.  I can count on the food being fresh and delicious. 

The food was a big hit!"}
{"text":"We have been to other Famous Dave's in the past and were happy. I spent 9 years in St Louis and 3 years in Dallas and have 2 grills and a smoker to show for it.  I never expect incredible barbecue from a chain but this was bad enough to prompt a review. 

I am not sure who the pit master was on a Saturday afternoon, but the ribs were dry and the brisket I was served was nothing but a fat cap. 

The service was excellent."}
{"text":"I stopped in with a friend during happy hour to watch some NHL playoffs. I have not eaten at a FD in years so I thought it would be a good place to try and reassess. Sitting at the bar was fun because it has an open feeling to it plus there are large (70 inch?) monitors to watch the game on. We got some bbq chips while waiting for dinner; the chips are pretty solid and I found them hard to put down. I got the manhandler sandwich with a corn bread muffin, and Wilbur beans. Beans were sweet but tasty and the portion was small, in my opinion. Muffin was darn good and slathered in butter. The sandwich was good, the links were charred (which I like) and pulled pork was not too greasy. Pickles were a nice touch as well. The meat didn't have a very distinct bbq or smoke taste to it so I was a bit disappointed. Either way it's not a bad place to stop off and relax. Prices are fair. Good happy hour, too."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bbq place. The portions are generous, the wait staff is attentive, and the atmosphere is fun. And their sauces are so tasty!"}
{"text":"Probably the best ribs I've had! In fact I like everything I've had the chicken, briskets, of course ribs. The sides I love the fries (awesome), garlic mashed potatoes, beans. The corn bread is way too delicous! I never get to eat my corn on the cob anymore since my dds always take mine, but when I used too they were yummy! We used to go to the Chandler location until this opened. This one is closer to us and not as busy. The food is just as good actually so far a bit more consistent, once in a while I got something at Chandler that wasn't as good as I'm used too but so far San Tan hasn't disappointed. The service is always really good except for the other Saturday night but my dh talked to the mgr because we love Daves and we didn't want others to be disapointed and not come back because of they're experience if they got a waiter/waitress in training but the mgr of course made it right away and I'm sure all other guests of Daves that night had a great time :) We will keep coming back unless of course I can find better bbq elsewhere ( I doubt it) but this place is so good I really don't want to try anywhere else for bbq, especially ribs!"}
{"text":"This was our first time eating at Famous Daves and we are hooked.  Ordered way more food than we could eat in one sitting, but tasted everything during our \"first course\" and nothing bad on the table.  Our server was Lauren and she couldn't have been more helpful. Overall,  a really good experience!"}
{"text":"Been here twice this week..chopped pork is ridiculously tender and flavorful. Service is very good and everyone is friendly.  Only thing I didn't like was the mashed potatoes but that's a personal taste thing..everything was awesome. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"I actually have not gone in here but any place that is willing to put out free water to people due to the heat is awesome in my book.  Thank you for doing that.  Also,  my boyfriend said that this place has amazing pickles"}
{"text":"You have to be a certain type of special person to like this food and be in a certain special state of mind to want to come here....like you have to have a heart attack a few seconds after taking a bite. 

If that's you and that's what you want. Have a ball. I will be enjoying not having clogged arteries somewhere else...."}
{"text":"The brisket rub this visit was bitter and overpowering. But most of the time you can't go wrong.  It's 2.5 hours from the house so we don't come here frequently but we do make it a point to stop whenever we're in town."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my third visit to this location because unlike the other location by the mall, I get great service here. Even when we came on fathers day we had a great time and awesome service.

Yesterday I was completely appalled by management...or lack thereof. 

We were sat in a booth, and it was clear they were shorthanded. We were one of about five tables sat at once to the poor two servers on the floor. Our table was one of about five that were sat at once, with a very large party of teenagers and a few more tables coming in after. Therefore, it took a few minutes for us to get greeted. Now, I have worked in restaurants for 16 years, including management and beyond. I know how things run. An older man in a table near us came over and asked if we had been greeted, we said no and he walked away. I assumed he was another customer, and told the waitress when she came over that we realized they just got a huge hit, and wanted to look over the menu anyway so we didn't want to jump on that weird guys bandwagon if he was causing a fuss up front. She said no, he was actually someone from corporate. Ahhh ok. So why would he not get a drink order instead of going off to delegate to people who had not greeted us because they were too busy, causing us to wait an additional five minutes??

So we order and get our food, and the whole time this man is wandering around, staring at tables with a notebook and making notes. He comes by our table a few times, staring at our empty glasses. Again, the place is slammed and you can see everyone is scrambling around and doing the stupid BBQ presentation at EVERY table. How asinine. You have guests waiting on service but you still insist your servers go through a long ass presentation at every table??? How is that time efficient? 

Now since corporate guy is doing nothing to help any situation, I wave him down and ask him since our server is so busy if he could help us out and get us some  refills. I can tell from his face he is not used to being asked to do anything physical. He looked at me like I was on crack, and said \"I will get THE GIRL right away.\" I was immediately flashed back to plantation days...the girl? Is she going to come over with a poofy white hat and say yessa massa? She is a server. I wanted to walk out at that moment.

He was DOING NOTHING but still refused to lift a finger to get us refills. Instead, he wandered to find the manager and the waitress to get them to do it. IF you are above pouring a drink in a restaurant, then you should not be working in any aspect of it, if Famous Dave himself is there he better get me a refill. That's GUEST SERVICE. The servers did not need someone to write a note to greet and take care of guests, they know to do that. They needed an extra pair of hands. Standing there and ordering them around is not going to make more servers appear, or make them faster. That's sweat shop mentality. That man should be ASHAMED.

As a manager in any respect, he should have been helping greet tables. Why would you walk away from a table that has yet to be greeted to try and find someone who is already slammed beyond comprehension? Why would you not greet them yourself? Is it more important to write notes so they know they were busy? 

In the customer service business, no one is above doing anything. A manager should never be afraid to bus a table. There is no reason someone who works for Famous Daves should have walked away from our table without greeting us themselves. There is no reason we should have gotten FOUR rounds of refills on our table because you went and yelled at the manager, the server and someone else. We literally received three waters each and my mom got three cokes. All because one asshat from corporate could not be bothered to lift a finger. THIS is how you run a business? 

I hope someone from high up reads this ( I am emailing them as well), and does something because our whole visit was BS. I watched YOUR corporate guy SIT and TAKE NOTES  for an hour and a half on how dissatisfied guests were from lack of service than to TRY and make them happy. SHAMEFUL."}
{"text":"Great server. The managers who came over were much more dull and down-beat.

Food for our group of four was all great except for one person who's meat was a tiny bit dry.

Overall, very worthy of my repeat business."}
{"text":"If you're from a place known for good BBQ (in my case.. originally from Texas) and are use to good, juicy, slow cooked meats, slowly smoked using various hardwoods on an open pit, I would suggest that you DON'T GO TO DAVE'S. I moved here (AZ) from Texas 13 years ago and have yet to find a BBQ joint, that I'm thrilled with. (Joe's in Gilbert comes closest so far)

I ordered the St Louis Style Spareribs and the \"Texas\" beef brisket. The ribs were passable but a little dry and lacking smoke flavor. The brisket was a joke !!..Not only did it lack flavor, it was sliced way too thick was also very dry and tough. It was like eating a plank of wood off my sundeck !!

I should have left when I tasted the cornbread muffins..they were dry and horribly too sweet..even underneath the disgusting honey topping. I would give this place a zero (0..goose egg..nada) but a one is as low as yelp will permit..I believe.

BTW..The service was excellent. My waitress was great..She can't help it if the food sux.."}
{"text":"Barbeque was good, but nothing spectacular. I had the combo with btisket and baby ribs. I do like the selection of bbq sauces....texas pit is my fav. 
Now the buffalo wings were very good....especially the pineapple flavor one which is a must have.
Overall not expensive and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great service, food, and cleanliness! It was our first time at Famous Dave's and we had a blast. The food was absolutely amazing although a little much for two people (Feast for Two). Our server was polite and had our food to us within five minutes of ordering. After leaving us with our food, he continued to check on us to see how it all tasted and if there was anything else we needed. Awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Everyone that works there are so nice and friendly! Never had a problem with this location"}
{"text":"Man I got to say service was actually pretty good and food was great my only concern is the way the manager was speaking to the employees I heard him yelling at one of the servers being rude treating her like she was nothing but trash I don't think you should have people running and type of establishment when they speak to people the way he did I asked his name and was told by three people his name is Ryan! So disrespectful especially the fact that he's doing it in front of other employees and loud enough that the guest in the building could hear!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good but the service is SO slow. I was in there at 3:30 this afternoon and it took over 20 minutes to get my to-go order."}
{"text":"With two very good, family run BBQ spots within 7miles of this place, I'm not sure why anyone would go here.  Their BBQ sauce is not homemade, it arrives at the store in bulk, and is no better than something you would find at Safeway.... full of additives, preservatives,  \"natural flavoring\", and most absurd, GLUTEN.  Skip this place and go to Cooper's or Joe's in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Best bbq in town! From the homemade pickles and chips, to variety in sauces, to OMG French fries, to quality burger and tender brisket. Holy yes! Service could have been more attentive. Otherwise, left happy happy happy."}
{"text":"Get out the napkins and dig in. Be sure to try the hot pickles when you come in the door.
They train their staff well and you always feel well taken care of here.
The food comes fast and the portions are large. Prices are good too.
It is always fun tasting the various BBQ sauces on  the table while you wait for your food. 
I love the zesty and sweet and spicy.
Smoked pork is awesome as are the ribs.
This is one of our regular places to dine and I cannot remember ever having a bad meal here or bad service.
I can see why they are always busy.
It is clean, great food and great service. Yuppp...5 stars for sure
Even the bathroom are nice!
It is BBQ with style.Arizona Style"}
{"text":"Famous Phil was a awesome server! The food was great like always along with a beer. Will always come back to famous Dave's"}
{"text":"Great food and staff.  Greeted with smiles and handled our orders very well.  Definitely try the bbq sauces!"}
{"text":"Our waiter Ethan provided the best service!!! Good food, no complaints. 

Normally if a place sucks, I can hit the Yelp word count rather easy, since this place is TOP NOTCH I am finding it difficult to go on and on."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and love the food here. I order a variety of things and at times at last minute just order something random without reading it. They have yet to disappoint on the food. Try all of their sauces, you are bound to find one that you will love. The service however I have only experience once that it was pretty slow to getting our food. The atmosphere is a great representation of barbecue. Need to get the family to come over again. Looking forward to it."}
{"text":"The meat is good.  But the rest of the sides...bland and taste like frozen food they nuked and slopped on your plate.  The service, however, sucks.  The waitress and hostess we had were a couple of teenage snotty cheerleader-type brats who spent more time texting their BFFs than actually making sure the customers were taken care of.  I even  got an eye-roll when I asked for more tea for my girlfriend, and Little Miss Thang took forever to get it.  Like, OHMIGAWD!

I should give them a 2 star, but I am chalking it up to someone maybe having a bad day.  In any event, the food was OK, but I was expecting better."}
{"text":"Went to out to eat with my husband for our last night together before he deployed we got seated in the bar had multiple servers and a manager pass us and didn't even blink are way we sat for 20 mins without any serves and ended up walking out ... will never go there again it was very disappointing"}
{"text":"Decided to have some Christmas Eve BBQ.  My son wanted to go here.  It was not very busy or very festive.  Service was absolutely terrible!  I always like to tip extra high for Christmas Eve service but she acted like she could care less about our table.  Forgot our pineapple steaks and took forever to get.  My wings were mushy and gross.  My son's brisket was overcooked and really dry.  Very disappointed.  We had come here a few years ago and it was excellent.  Not sure what has happened.  Would never return."}
{"text":"This place gets it right every visit. I am no expert on BBQ food but you really can't beat the consistency Dave's seems to always deliver the good when we visit. I love the range of sauces on the table and the Devil's Spit is my choice every time!

We will be back."}
{"text":"Over-priced, bloated chain restaurant operation, pre-heated frozen sides

Simply put, this is the same quality of bbq or worse that is made at a restaurant where you stand in line, get a tray, and they serve you cafeteria style. 

Exception at Famous Dave's is that they want to sit you down, over-charge you for meat and sides that are pre-made and try and up charge you with drinks so you have to pay more on tip.

Our server was nice enough and we ordered two meat with two sides each for me and my gf. It took 5 minutes for them to get the food out. You know what that tells me? Yeah we shouldn't have to sit down and the server come take our order. The only reason they don't go the traditional route is to charge us extra since 'sit-down dining experience' people expect to pay more. THATS IT.

The meat was good I guess, I had the bbq chicken and pulled pork. The sides were atrocious, mac-n-cheese I can just taste the pre-madeness with injected cheese flavoring, cole slaw was runny. In the end we paid $40 plus tip to $46.

Only come here if you want to pay extra to sit down and have someone bring the food to you."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place. They have generous portions of tasty barbequed meat, tasty sides, and reasonable prices. We stopped in here Sunday afternoon. This store is located in a large shopping plaza. It wasn't too busy that day. We were seated immediately and greeted by our server who had a trainee with her. The service was prompt.

I ordered the 2 meat lunch combo. the first was the pulled pork the second was the deep fried cod fish. The pork was as good as it always is. I like to jazz it up with Famous Dave's Devil Spit sauce. I have wanted to try the fish for a while. This was a nice filet with a flavorful corn meal coating, deep fried to a crispy crunch. This served with a unique tartar sauce. The sauce had spicy pickle relish in it giving it a bit of a bite. 

I got a huge corn muffin and baked beans for a side. I love their corn muffins. They are moist and go well with the barbequed meat. I would have liked butter with it which I didn't get. Needles to say. I had to loosen my belt a bit when I left."}
{"text":"Came to famous dave's for some BBQ, which tasted alright, but the wait was incredibly long, especially for something not that special . There are a few other BBQ places around the area, so if I had the chance or time, I'd probably give another place a shot and save yourself some time."}
{"text":"I like FD's a lot, and particularly this location.  We generally eat in a booth in the bar, which is a bit more peaceful and private than out in the restaurant area.  Service has always been attentive and friendly.  Love the ribs, and they have particularly good sides, other than the half-ear of corn, which tastes frozen, boiled, bland, and crummy.  And Brak LOVES his corn.  The cornbread redeems however, it's excellent.  They also have great cole slaw and potato salad.  FD's registers a solid 4.75 stars on the Brak-o-meter, 1/4 star deducted for the crappy corn."}
{"text":"Good lunch deals, reasonable prices. The St Louis ribs are my fave by far. Many side order options, and they're all good in my experience. Not a big fan of the brisket here, which is surprising as I'd expect better. The hot links, one of the lunch options, are outstanding."}
{"text":"This Famous Dave's location is one of the best I've visited. The staff is always friendly and efficient. They do their best to get to know their loyal customers.

I've actually visited this location on two of their worst days in the last 10 years. On one of these days, we wanted to beat the intense heat. Since they usually overdo the air conditioning (like most restaurants), we decided to visit partially to cool off. It turned out that their AC was broken. Despite the place being warm, our experience was positive because of how attentive our server was. She made sure cold drinks stayed full and that our stay didn't have to be longer than necessary.

On another bad day for them, they were replacing wood and shingles on their roof, with big holes in it. It turned out we had a biblical downpour right over lunch that day. They were banging away trying to cover the openings with plywood while it poured. Lightning struck a tree at the opposite side of their parking lot, which caused power to go out for 5 seconds. When it came back up, we were welcomed by leaks springing up all over. We got reseated twice (big rivulets poured right into my Mountain Dew!) before they figured out where we could sit to avoid leaks. Despite the chaos, our service was still courteous and quick. They got us out of there so we could pick our way through the flooding back to work.

The food is very consistent - I usually get a two meat special, which is rarely subpar. Occasionally the brisket is a little dry. Another great item on the menu is the chili and baked potato combo."}
{"text":"I just had my birthday meal of choice, BBQ! I had the 2 meat combo of spare ribs and chopped pork. I like all the sauces here but I normally just snack on it while waiting for my meal as the meat either comes with some or just doesn't need it. They have these homemade chips to munch on as well but be warned I think they are very salty, probably good for the bar sales. Everything was tender and juicy and with the lunch time prices (11-5) you get a really good value. I also had the wilbur beans and for the first time actually tried the cornbread muffin which was surprisingly good as well. FDs is consistent and tasty, what is not to like."}
{"text":"Some of the best barbecue choices and meat that we've tasted in a while. Our waiter, John Wayne was really helpful and showed us some of the favorites. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"decent place! not to bad.... not to good. we ordered burnt ends to start with. of course comparing them to porkopolis was incomparable:) but they were not bad, just not amazing like i'm used too. but i have got to say, the brisket was up to par, made my top 10 for brisket places in Arizona, it was delish! the prices here though are outrageous! probably because it's in the Mall area but jeez! the value is just not there imo. wife got the pulled pork sandwich, which she said was gross, but she's very black and white when it comes to her pulled pork. it's either amazing, or gross. but i tasted it, it was rather meaty tasting then loaded with yummy flavor. to be honest. we didn't like the mac and cheese, it has corn and jalapenos.... just not what i imagine when i order mac and cheese. but if that's your thing! go for it! mash potatoes were also very bland and tasted like they have been sitting all day. so all in all what we concluded is that we wont be coming back. maybe for some brisket... but that about sums it up for us. oh ya, and 2 dollars for 2 slices of bread... when i just asked for 1 extra piece. not very cool, especially when they don't tell you they are going to charge for it until its too late.take it for what it is, but i'll take my hard earned money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went to Tempe, Az for the weekend for my niece's wedding. 5 stars for the BBQ.  Had the feast for 2 for the wife and I.  Came with St Louis spare ribs, beef brisket, chicken, BBQ beans. Cole slaw. Potatoes, corn on the Cobb and cornbread. 

Meats and cornbread were perfect.   Sides - Cole slaw, BBQ beans. Green beans, mashed potatoes, mac n cheese - were just OK.  Lots of potatoes which we really didn't eat cause they were just bland, flavorless, and dry.  Wait.  The corn and cornbread were awesome.  Especially the cornbread.  

KIds had a few things, hot link (wasn't hot) more like mild link, and catfish fingers.  Not bad.  But nothing to race about.  

Why the 3 stars you say? 

Welllllllllllllllll......

It was happy hour.  And guess what? Can't have happy hour menu or pricing at the table.  Only at the bar.  Mid you the place is 3/4 empty on a Friday afternoon.  

So you can go to the bar and bring it back to your table.  Why does that not make any sense to me whatsoever? 

So I ask our hostess what their happy hour consisted of, says \"I don't know\", asked her for a happy hour menu.  She states I will find one and never returns.  

I ask our waiter if he has a happy hour menu or knows what happy hour consists of, guess what he says?  \"I don't know\".  Almost like they don't want me to drink liquor!!! At a restaurant.  And we all know most restaurants usually want to push drinks down your throats all night long.  

So, I go to the bar happy hour beer $3 and $4, tall glass 22 oz $4 domestics $5 imports. Not bad.  $3 we'll drinks. I ask the bartender (that looks like a young slimmer Tracy Morgan) what can he mix.  He says, \"Basically rum, vodka, tequila, with soda and stuff as long as it ain't no juice\". 

I was like, hmmm... no actual pre set menu or any attempt to entice anyone with actual happy hour drinks.  I pretty much have up and had a couple of blue moons and called it a night... 

To summarize.  BBQ and cornbread 5 stars.  Sides 3 stars. Service and knowledge of the place you work at, 3 stars, happy hour/bar 3 stars.... 

Over all not bad.... could be better."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner last night.  At first it seemed nice.  It was a little late around 8pm and so there wasn't a lot of people in.  I am gluten intolerant and they gave me suggestions which was awesome, however that is where the awesomeness stopped :(   We went out to dinner to celebrate my husbands birthday.  I told our server but she didn't do anything for him.  When we were done with dinner we waited a good 10-15 minutes but she never came back and we had to go chase her down for the bill.  Pretty disappointing when there are so many other restaurants in the area we could have gone to."}
{"text":"BBQ hits the spot and the staff are amazing.  I like that the ladies there know their beer.  Gonna keep this place as my occasional spot."}
{"text":"GREAT NEW HAPPY HOUR!  Ok, A great new place to do Happy Hour!  They just began this happy hour thing last month and it's been well worth the wait.  $2 drafts, $3 huge drafts, $3 wells & 1-4 Dollar appetizers.  They always feature the current Sam Adams seasonal & JIMMY BUFFET'S Land Shark Lager so there is always somthing nice to quench yoour thirst.  
The greatest feature of all?   These specials can only be had at the bar, so NO SCREAMING CHILDERN to deal with!!! YAY!!!  
REALLY!  Dosen't it just suck that parents think it's ok to subject other people to their poorly raised howling children? Won't have that problem doing happy hour here!!! YAY AGAIN!!! I'm a fan!!!"}
{"text":"Lot's of choices on sauce. My wife who absolutely hates BBQ will not step foot in this place. When I bring home the spare rib and tri tip combo she locks herself away in the bedroom. But the day I brought home babyback ribs instead she seemed intrigued enough to try them out. After eating half my slab she changed her mind about BBQ. Awesome portions, great price, great food. The one in Tempe off Dobson is just as good too."}
{"text":"We love this place. I usually get the chopped pork or brisket and my husbands loves the ribs, rib tips, smoked sausage, and burnt ends. We always sit in the bar area when Wes is working, because he is the best server/bartender. We have never had bad service from him. We mostly get good service in the dining rooms also, but I'm not thrilled that they added televisions to the other dining area. I don't want to be distracted by sports when I'm out for a nice meal."}
{"text":"How does a barbecue spot not have ribs at noon? Called for a takeout order and they had no ribs available! What a joke of a restaurant!"}
{"text":"Really good food. Had the baby back ribs and they were great. Smoked to perfection, moist, tender and nice bark. Several sauces to choose from, I dump em on the frys. Tasty coleslaw good service. I would go again."}
{"text":"Rib tips and cornbread are good but that is pretty much the highlight of our visit. Waitress was in a hurry but then it took 23 minutes to get an appetizer and an additional 5 minutes for my drink. 

With 2 kids, this is terrible. 

Corn was undercooked and was not impressed with the chile. BBQ chicken was ehhh..."}
{"text":"I never knew I loved pickles as much as I do until I came here. 

You are say with a plate of chips and BBQ sauces to start and it only gets tastier after. 

My wife and I always split our meals because they come so big. We go with the two meat dinner and sides. I love their chicken and the brisket is really smokey and moist. 

I missed fried okra from when I was in Texas so I like that whenever I go. The desserts are a must... Especially if you like bread pudding."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with new friends after church Sunday!!  Place was busy but service prompt in taking our order and delivery of our yummy Baby Back Ribs and Stuffed Baked Potatoes!!  Portions and quality of items ordered lived up to the generous reputation Famous Dave's represents!!"}
{"text":"Used to love Famous Dave's before it became corporate and moved away from quality.  That was a different time and in the state to the west of Wisconsin, even though the Hayward location is the original.  The ribs are now are par-cooked, frozen, and shipped to the locations to be re-heated on the grill.  Maybe this satisfies a barbeque fix, but once private equity owners take over a restaurant, quality goes downhill.  I don't think Dave is even involved with the operation anymore.  Skip and go to another place or the Honky Tonk in Chicago.  Or buy the sauce (one good thing that's still there) and make your own ribs."}
{"text":"I am not entirely sure why this place is called famous Dave's. Maybe I need to try the brisket or the pork or something else on the menu because the ribs were terrible. Extremely dry and very tough. You can tell they cook these ribs over direct heat as the bones were chard as well as some of the crust. Full disclosure: I've been smoking meats for years so I know what good Q looks like.  Maybe they're famous for the sauce because I have to say it was pretty good however when ribs come out with sauce on it that is an indication to me that it's going downhill from there. I'll stop back by and give these guys one more shot and I'll try something else on the menu and update my post at that time."}
{"text":"I used Famous Dave's to cater my son's graduatuon. There was a ton of food for the money.  Had the pulled chicken, brisket, potsto salad and mac and cheese. Got nothing but compliments from the 80 or so guest.  Would absolutely use them again."}
{"text":"I don't appreciate walking into a restaurant where I plan to spend a good chunk of change and not be greeted at all. And then to stand there for a solid 5+ minutes and no one even notices you're there. Asked for the manager and had to KEEP WAITING. So I just left. It's a shame because the food is great. Hence the 2 stars. Probably won't be back, Dillion's has much better service."}
{"text":"Came in the other night to share some apps before a movie. Aly was our server and was simply fantastic. Super sweet, informative and we had everything we needed. Foot came out hot, fast and was really good. Brisket, burnt ends and cornbread were our faves but the mac n cheese was pretty good as well. Corn was corn. Onion strings are also good. We really enjoyed all the different sauces but not the pickles on the table as well. Thanks Aly, we'll def ask for you next time!"}
{"text":"You can pig out here, and they won't squeal. How do I know? That's what their t-shirts say. But, if you don't want to feast on the pig, you have other options, too, like beef, chicken and fish. 

The decor is fun, especially if you're among a hard-to-please crowd that is a mix of a) those who like to try new things and b) those who like the tried and true. 

I'm told what makes Famous Dave's so famous is their BBQ sauce. Honestly, I wasn't impressed with any of their sauces, although it was fun for our waiter to explain each one, then draw the first letter of the sauce's name on a plate - easy for us to sample! 

I flipped through their beer menu and was really happy to see they have Alaskan Amber Ale on tap, as well as Sam Adams. In the bottle, they have other varieties, like Red Stripe. I have to admit, for being a franchise, this place offers up a beer selection that's hard to beat (for your Average Joe destination).  The Alaskan Amber was the highlight of my day, for it was served ice cold in a chilled glass. Perfection! It went really well with the salmon I ordered, along with one of the best cornbread muffins I've had! 

While I didn't finish my entree - I found the green beans to be too cold and bland and the salmon to be just \"meh\" - I did find delight in 3 things. 

1. Alaskan Amber Ale on tap
2. Cornbread Muffin
2. Warm apple chutney on the side

Would I go back here? Yes, I definitely would, even if it's in Mesa RiverHell Marketplace.

Famous Dave's is a sure compromise for my family. I can drink the beer. They can eat the BBQ. My dad even said he'd give this place a 5-star rating. 

So, in summary: This place is a family-pleaser, and I can't refuse any invitation to partake of the 3 aforementioned treats!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for BBQ this is a good one.  I drive by on my way to work in the morning and I can smell them smoking the meats.  My wife doesn't like BBQ (blasphemy) so I only can swing this once a month and it never disappoints. I love the St Louis racks with Daves Mac Cheese and Wilbur Beans.  The corn bread muffins are great and I think are the reason the wife affords me the once a month.  Theres a chain of these and i have eaten at a few when traveling for work and all have been great.  The Wilburs Revenge hot BBQ sauce is really what sets it apart for me...its hot...very hot and that is a good thing."}
{"text":"Dave, I get it.  Your establishment serves lots of tasty meat.  Understood. But do you have to name a sandwich \"Texas Manhandler\"?  That's really just too much."}
{"text":"Very good food for a decent price. Not too family friendly...We took my parents and the kids out to Famous Daves on a Sunday afternoon while they were in town and we got some pretty nasty glares from customers for having two toddlers at our table. Our waitress definitely seemed more tuned to the glaring customers' needs than ours, which was disappointing. Hopefully the next visit will be better. Such a shame for a place with such good food!"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time here and it's always the same regardless of how busy - slow and sub-standard food quality for famous daves."}
{"text":".                          MY real barbecue.

However Famous Dave's does it, it couldn't be more REAL to me.  Always tender, moist, meaty and flavorful---every single succulent St. Louis rack.  Prices went up a bit, but that's okay when 2 full orders of what may be the highest grade of pork equals 5 to 6 satisfying, generously-sized meals.  (3-4 ribs each.)   With one rack, you eat once in relative---perfectly acceptable---comfort...then twice more at home in cushioned comfort but without shoes or makeup, watching a movie or ball game.   In 7 or 8 visits, it's always been 5 stars.   I'm VERY particular about food quality and preparation, so that's an excellent track record for any restaurant
---especially a chain.   

Although I rarely drink alcohol, I also enthusiastically recommend their Margarita.  This salty-sweet-fabulous version is so incredibly salty, sweet and fabulous that I can't imagine it being duplicated or improved in any way.   If you like Margarita's or fruity alcoholic drinks but haven't tried theirs---or if you're not a drinker but would like a happy little buzz---try it.

                                    ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

              Is REAL BARBECUE anything like 
           real FRY or real SAUTE or real BOIL?

If I hear or read the word REAL one more time---associated in any way with BARBECUE---that will make it about the ten thousandth.  Will we ever stop quibbling about what's REAL in the way of barbecueing?  It's a cooking preparation---not some patented, exclusive-to-one-single-location, ethnicity or culture.  It's a way to ROAST, i.e. cook something, and about as individual and varied as how one preps and fries up chicken parts.  And, in every sense of the word, every single barbecue style is \"real\".

If that explanation doesn't help to suppress fist fights, screaming matches, fierce cook-off challenges, and name-calling, we can step back in time.  What IS \"real\" barbecue, anyway?  I'd say it's the one that was invented way before intelligible words and easily understandable verbal communication skills were worked out.  The \"real\" barbecue probably made its debut around a branch, bone, and grease-fueled fire, on some dry, scorching-hot savannah, and was voraciously and audibly consumed by a varied assemblage of snarly-haired dust-covered unclothed and prehistoric antelope-like-skin-wearing early man.   A welcomed feast of fire-roasted, unbelievably-good-right-down-to-the-big-old-bone, mastodon.   

We can thank our Neanderthals and Cro-Magnons for \"inventing\" REAL barbecue---whether by accident, or carefully considered mind-broadening simple step-by-step deduction---likely resulting in wild high-spirited stomping, yelling, and approving grunts.   As each solitary group discovered the magic of fire, BBQ joints continued popping up, dotting the plains.  THAT'S real barbecue.   Anything else that followed were \"variations on a theme\"---like the renditions of a violin sonata or jazz piece, all evolving from an original---the REAL one, the first one. 

Barbecueing / fire roasting / spit roasting became an individual interpretation by culture and geographic location---nothing more---but all real.  Plain, marinated, or slathered.  Southern BBQ, Korean BBQ, Mongolian, Texan, Carolina, Cambodian, Australian BBQ--- EVERYONE does it.  It's a world-wide roasting phenomenon!  No.  It's just an easy, low-cost, simple technique to make something raw and bloody taste and look a heck of a lot better.   None are \"real\" in the sense it's the one-and-only, be-all-and-end-all, mine-is-better-than-yours mentality, because each and every one is \"real\" to those who love that style.   

Hot, smoking, aroma-filled barbecues awaken our appetites and make our mouths water whether it's fresh off the rugged coast of Tunisia or fresh from the kitchen of a restaurant located at the edge of a mall parking lot in North Olmsted, Ohio.  Let's get real.  They're ALL real.

{"text":"They get 4 stars because I like their ribs so much. 
For a national chain, they try to get it right. Service at this Chandler Mall location has always been very good. Iced tea fresh and icy!
French fries better than average. Beans tasty with spicy sausage to give a kick. Brisket is just fair, a bit dry. Their big salads are pretty good, but the surprise is their burgers! Excellent mix of beef, great flavor and texture.
If you have room, I recommend the bread pudding.
Solid food, good service, and they support Veterans in a very generous way!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. The servers are really nice and friendly, but the service can be a bit on the slow side when they are busy. And unfortunately it is usually busy. For some reason they do not take reservations, so if you plan on going during a busy time, be prepared to wait. On our most recent visit we arrived at 5:00 and didn't leave the restaurant until after 7:30. They get quite backed up.

The first time we went the server forgot my husband's fries, and it took quite a while to get water refills, but the food was really good. The second time we went our waitress was really on it and we had a great experience, but the food wasn't as amazing as the first time. The third time we went was a mess. We had the same server as the second time, and she was still very nice, but we never got our appetizer, they messed up everyone's food, forgot part of each persons order, messed up the bill, and then split the bill incorrectly. We eventually had to just get our food that they'd forgotten in a to-go box because by the time they finally brought it out we were completely done eating. Our server was running around like a chicken with her head cut off, but it wasn't her fault. They were way understaffed and extremely busy. 

My husband gets the ribs and brisket, and I get the brisket, and we enjoy the meat and our sides. We've also had the burnt ends appetizer, which is good, but not as \"burnt\" as expected. The cornbread is also amazing, and that's coming from someone who doesn't care for cornbread. We still love this place and will definitely go back, just probably during a less busy time."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's for Veterans Day. Thank you for honoring Veterans like you do. Famous Dave's is s generous to Vets. They offer a wonderful meal for Vets and treats us so nice. Thank you !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you can't pay no mind to comments that exaggerates on how they experienced bad customer service due to impatience on the waiting time for your food.  Me and my boyfriend came here on a Saturday and if you walk into any popular business especially on a weekend please have the patience, if not then stay home and do something with yourself. My night wasn't ruined because of the staff and how long I waited, my night was ruined by a big white family that was seated across from me. She complained that her and her family,  waited a long time for their food and the waitress apologized but then said it was super busy. she then had to bring her manager to diffuse the situation. As I'm trying to enjoy my ribs and brisket, all I kept hearing was that white lady bickering back at the managers while the guy was trying to help out. I get the wait is long but thats what happens when you bring in a big family of damn near 15 in the busiest day! So as I was trying to enjoy my meal with fries over a bickering mouse, I hear the manager trying to give her a discount with apologizing for their troubles. What the hell sir', you should of gave me the discount for having to hear this whole mess she's trying to create out of no where when I was simply just trying to relax and enjoy a good bbq feast. That lady just kept laughing making wolf puff noises and looking at her family like is she the crazy one. For all she knows, what if that manager had cooks calling out and couldn't find a replacement, what if the waitress is dealing with something at home and you just had to crap on her life like that, what if the manager had someone quit on him and so he was short staffed and that's what explains the reason why your food is late but still nice hot and fresh when you receive it. I swear the whole time I sat and ate with my boyfriend, all we heard was that bird chirping. I still received excellence service with our guy waiter even though it took long but I had time so i was chillin and kept looking at that lady because I was being entertained even though the manager was stressing out but I think he did great from a customer point of view, and we all ate good so we should just appreciate the Lord for his timely manner on feeding us, Amen."}
{"text":"Great casual place to take the family out to for lunch or dinner. The staff is always in a great mood and provide outstanding service. The food is always fresh and decently priced."}
{"text":"Their BBQ used to be really good but seems to have gone downhill over the years. We got our order to go and after a few bites, we decided we're done with this chain and not coming back. The brisket and rib tips were soooo dry and lacking flavor and everything BBQ should be. I should have just gone out and gotten a bag of beef jerky. The green beans were super dead and soggy and there wasn't even a hint of spice like it's suppose to have. The beans and coleslaw were ok, but how can you really mess those up? When we went to pick up our food, they said there was curbside pickup and to pull up and they'll see us through the camera and bring the food right out. We pulled up and waited a good 10 minutes before going into the restaurant and trying to figure out where to pick up our food. We probably will not be back."}
{"text":"I have 3 favorite Steakhouses, this is one of them! I like the  idea of country style kind of interior design of this place. 
Of course the foods are great as always! I order different things, it depends with my mood..and it's flavourly prepared! The meet is so tender and juicy.. I always love the feast for two platter to share. It's a delightful mixture combination of everything. Their corn bread is always good! Very yummy! It's always a happy tummy dinner here every time we come here. 
When you're craving for some mouthwatering barbecue , for me, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Ordered Famous Dave's for a work event. We got beef brisket and bbq pulled chicken, along with sides of mac & cheese, sweet corn (on the cob), potato salad, and garden salad. 

When the delivery driver arrived, I was worried that there wasn't going to be enough food for some reason. I don't know if it was the way it was packaged or what, but I was very wrong! We had so much delicious food!

The brisket and the chicken were both huge hits. Famous Dave's provided us with a variety of bbq sauces and wet wipes which was great. Plenty of buns for sandwiches as well. The sides were all great. The mac & cheese was a big hit! Note - there is corn in the mac which is something I have never had before, but it was delish! Just something to be aware of for anyone with corn sensitivities. 

The salad was really impressive. It was just your basic ingredients, but everything was very fresh and crisp. The best part was the cheese! It was shredded, SMOKED, cheddar. I've never had smoked cheese on a salad before, but now I am hooked! 

Overall I am very happy with the food and service. Will probably order catering from them again in the future."}
{"text":"It may be Famous Dave's, but besides the great BBQ (and the mac 'n' cheese) the reason we keep coming back is Famous Erica! My sister and I lived out of state, but started coming here when visiting our parents and we first encountered Erica - personable, great sense of humor, attentive without being intrusive, excellent menu knowledge and recommendations. What more could you want?

That first visit was years ago. Our parents have passed, but I still find myself in Chandler (usually) twice a year, and it's not a proper visit if my sister and I don't go to \"Dave's\" to \"have lunch\" with Erica.

The food's great (oh, save room to share a bread pudding!) ... but when Erica's there it's even better!"}
{"text":"Went there for their \"buy a $25 Gift Card and get 2 $5 bonus cards\".   Well, what they don't tell you until after you purchase them, is that the $5 cards can not be used until next year AND they can't be used together.   I think this is pretty shady at least and dishonest at its worst.  Feels like the old hair and switch.   If they are going to put such restrictions on the cards, they should say so up front.  Feel lied to and misled.  I will use the cards on different occasions, then never return.   Very disappointed with the dishonesty of what I thought was a reputable company."}
{"text":"Fantastic service tonight! I had dinner there tonight with my mom. She signed up for their emails last time she was there and had received a free sandwich coupon that was expiring at the the end of the month.

She had the pulled chicken sandwich...she said next time, no cheese. 

I ordered the small beef brisket nacho appetizer and a loaded baked potato. The nachos were not small, they were like a large taco salad. It was amazing with all the toppings and I asked for my favorite BBQ sauce instead of what normally they use on it. The portion for less than $7 was amazing!  I didn't even touch the potato, it is now in my fridge for lunch tomorrow! Another great deal for under $4! Can't beat the quality and price! Overall, we were out the door for $18 with tip!

One negative: The food did take a long time to come out but it was a Friday night."}
{"text":"Several sauces to choose from. I ordered the baby back ribs. Very tender and full of flavor. Wish we had one in Louisiana."}
{"text":"We used to go quite often to Famous Dave's with the family. Everyone enjoyed the meals. We had not been for a couple of years. Maybe we just got burned out on BQ. 
It was early and my wife and I were looking for a place to eat. We were passing by Dave's and decided we needed to stop for BQ. 
IF you have not been to Dave's the place is decorated with old antiques and posters, signs pictures of BQ places around the US. There is outside seating and this is a great option this time of year. The staff is always or has always been very friendly and accommodating. 

What a great choice. The secret is getting there before and ordering before 4:30. I got the rib tips and brisket. My wife just got the pulled pork. There was enough food on my plate for three people. (if you had already feasted on the seasoned homemade potato chips). The total for both our meals was under $18.00 and both of us took home enough food for a meal. I ate mine for lunch for the next two days. Put in on a tortilla with some cheese, one min, in the microwave and lunch. 
Now if I could just get the rest of the family to eat early. Some times being retired has it perks. 
Enjoy good food. Go see Dave."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's is orgasmic BBQ.  I've never been too keen on BBQ just for the reason that it is always so freakin messy.  I don't like getting messy while I eat, because despite what your server thinks, the tiny little \"wet nap\" doesn't really do the trick.

Get the brisket platter with the cole slaw and the wilbur beans.  That is the best combination of food here.  I always use the Sweet & Sassy bbq sauce and my taste buds are translated directly to heaven.  All their other food is good too, I have never once been dissatisfied, but the brisket is the best.  I love how they leave like 6 different sauces at your table so you can play with them and mix and match.  It's totally the way to go.

Service has never been disappointing here.  They all know how to do their job well here, even when the place is jam packed, and it will be at dinner time.  If you want to get a real gut-busting meal that tastes delicious, go to Famous Dave's and hopefully you will have a food experience as mind blowing as mine always is."}
{"text":"I think this is my favorite Famous Dave's in the whole world because it is inside a refurbished barn.  Eating ribs on the second floor of the round barn is awesome!

You go to this Famous Dave's, you get what you expect from a famous dave's:  Cheap, kinda average barbecue.  But it's in a barn!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good for a chain BBQ joint. I recommend the rib tips with the georgia style sauce. You will need lots of napkins!"}
{"text":"Ordered brisket and pulled pork.  No smoke taste at all, bbq sauce really helped the taste.  Server was very nice.  Gave him great tip. Food not so good.  Prbly will not return."}
{"text":"my day job will on occasion get catering from Famous Dave's BBQ

we usually only get pulled pork, chicken, and brisket, the beans, and potato salad.


the Pork is pretty good. the brisket is smoky. but i don't normally order brisket anywhere so i cannot really compare it. the beans are pretty good...its got meat in it!!!. the potato salad is tasteless. meh. 

the sauce is REALLY good. i prefer the Devil's Spit. i still have a packet of it on my desk. trying to figure what I'm going to put it on. my hand looks pretty tasty... ARRRGH!!!! 

ok..I'll save the rest to put on real food."}
{"text":"Last visit; horrendous service.  This time I tried delivery from an online app....they gave the order to the wrong driver. Delivered to wrong address.  Waited an hour and a half to find out.  I like Famous Dave's food but between this and lousy service my last visit, won't eat ther again."}
