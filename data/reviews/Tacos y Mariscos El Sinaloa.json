{"text":"Best ceviche de Camaron I've had in Phoenix. Asada was delicious and the pastor couldn't have been better! I also recommend the Govenador tacos!!"}
{"text":"I hiked North Mountain (I don't live far from here) today and was looking for a good quick bite to eat on my way home and discovered this place. Great customer service, quick food times, food is made fresh to order, and the prices are spectacular for the amount of food you get. They have THE BEST shrimp tacos I have ever had anywhere, and I will be making a point to come here frequently now that I've discovered this wonderful place. If you want GREAT food for a VERY reasonable price, go here today!"}
{"text":"We were heading to a different taco truck, however the set up of this place caught our attention and we decided to try it!
I'm happy we did!
First they are a very nice and attentive, 
The place is very clean, the seafood and vegetables are really fresh and tasty, we also ordered carne asada and it was very flavorful and soft! I posted some pictures of what we ordered, we got Marlin Taco ( my favorite!!!) Yum! Carne Asada quesadilla, the quesadillas are huge and enough to fill you. Shrimp quesadilla, and fish tacos. 
All the food is authentic, I also liked that they have designated parking spots for costumers. And music is playing on the background if you feel is too loud, you can ask them to lower the volume, we did and they were very accommodating.
We will be back!
Thank you :)"}
{"text":"Very yummy ceviche and quesadillas. I was skeptical at first because it is seafood n a food truck. The cook is very nice and the ceviche has some great flavors. The green salsa is very good! Do not go expecting fancy fresh seafood."}
{"text":"Fish Burrito!! Soooo Amazing! BYOB or choose from Jarritos. Can't wait to try the tacos next time."}
{"text":"You guys have to give it a try! I love the customer service! They are very helpful! I tried the ceviche it was very good. But quesadilla Governador is the best I ever have. 100% recommended!"}
{"text":"Hands down THE best tacos in Arizona! Definitely a hidden gem. If you haven't been here before... now is the time, before it becomes wildly popular and the line is out the door. 
The shrimp tacos are as authentic as they can get, from the sauce to the tortillas. The employees are extremely nice and accommodating. 
It's better ti bring cash when you come here but they do accept pretty much all forms of CC. 
You won't regret it if you try this place."}
{"text":"This place is EPIC! Best fish tacos and burritos outside of San Diego's trucks. 
Get the pescado burrito then thank me for improving your life. Get the aguachile and bring your own beer to pair."}
{"text":"Really great permanent food truck at corner of 7th St and Dunlap.  Had the carne asada burrito.  Huge and only 5 bucks.  Seating in nearby tent.  Can't wait to try it again.  Open every day but Monday."}
