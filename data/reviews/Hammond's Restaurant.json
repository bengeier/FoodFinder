{"text":"Now closed.    Hammon's was and institution of simple diner food for a few pennies.  Don't know how they managed for so low at such a low margin.  It closed and is now gutted.  It was nice to have them while it lasted.  Not many place around like Hammond's.  It was the quintessential local breakfast/lunch hang out for all the locals.  Americana at it's best.  It will be missed."}
{"text":"Super dive-y, but also super cheap!   A real burger for under $3?  Thank you very much."}
{"text":"If you want 'fancy' or commercial, skip it.  If you like local character, don't miss Hammond's!  We arrived about 10am for breakfast and ordered lunch instead.  The coffee is okay.  They were out of orange juice but managed to find half a glass for my husband.  The most expensive thing on the menu was the daily special of Steak 'N Stuff with corn and mashed potatoes at $6.50.  I wish I'd had it because it looked like really good comfort food.  I did have the grilled cheese and home fried potatoes, both well done as requested.  Steve had the Monster Burger - 2 patties on toasted white bread with cheese.  It was HUGE and delicious.  He had a side of onion rings and they were crispy outside and juicy inside.    The walls are covered with locally drawn characters.  The waiter offered to give me his phone number.  He (the waiter) was quite a character himself and was good about steering me off a dish that I was considering.  The customers, the dish washer, the cook and the waiter were really friendly.  They don't take credit cards and a table behind us didn't have cash so the waiter told them where the banks were. They left with a promise to return and he said \"I know you will\".  They did.  I asked for a to go menu and he wiped off a laminated menu (front and back of 8-1/2 x 11\" bright yellow paper) and said to take it.  I promised to return it tomorrow as we intend to go back.   Three beverages, two meals and a couple of sides came to under $12 and was one of the most memorable meals we had on this Wander."}
