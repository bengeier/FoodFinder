{"text":"We ate lunch here twice on our way to/fro Grand Canyon via Phoenix airport.  
Great service - waiter and owner were very attentive and made sure we were taken care of promptly.  Never had an empty glass or long wait for anything.
Wonderful food - everything was cooked perfectly and was very tasty.  Churro ice cream sandwich was a nice way to end a flavorful meal on a hot day.
Pleasant surroundings - patio had trees and misters to keep us cool while the interior was clean and nicely decorated.
Highly recommend and would visit again the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"The food was great, I had the shrimp and chips my husband had the burrito. The restaurant was cute and intimate. My only complaint would be the waitress who ignored our table and we had to find her to bring us the check."}
{"text":"I liked the creativity but the burger with the English muffin just didn't do it for me. I guess that's the reason why this is the only place I have been to that serves burgers on muffins. If your looking for something different and want to explore than come try this place; but I probably won't be back on my own effort."}
{"text":"You guys did it again. Great vibe, drinks and food. The staff is so down to earth and friendly. We have loved your coffee shop since dAy one and will now equally love this place."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place a couple of times on the way to work and have always wanted to check it out, well today I did and it was completely worth it! I stooped for lunch and had the Classic Burger (American Cheese, Tomato, Red Onion, Butter Lettuce, Mayo) served on a toasted English Muffin, It was perfect. As I set at the bar waiting for my order I could see them making some of their other dishes and the Breakfast Burrito looked Amazing, I think I'll try that next time. Phoenix is known for its good local food and this place is no exception, I highly recommend The Dressing Room!"}
{"text":"The absolute friendliest service from every employee we encountered. We were seated outside on the patio which had such a cool, relaxing vibe. The menu was simple, but just enough and everything looked amazing, it was hard to choose! Loved everything about our experience here, 10/10 recommend!"}
{"text":"We are from out of town, California Bay Area.  We happened to stumble into the Dressing Room! What great luck!  The service was top notch, the music hip and fun, the food delicious. The menu was simple, clean and prices were too fair for the quality of the food and service.  The mixed drinks they serve are perfect and tasty!  If you are looking for a break from the mundane, go here!"}
{"text":"Two words - Veggie Tacos! They were delish, it was happy hour all day and the service was great. Perfect stop for a late lunch!"}
{"text":"I had a great lunch yesterday here. It was so good, I came back with a second group of friends on the same day and enjoyed half priced drinks all day. The staff is super friendly up at the bar. The cooks love what they do and it's great being able to talk to them from the bar with the grill right next to it. Amanda's a sweet bartender too and makes some mean cocktails oh and the soba noodles salad is my fave!"}
{"text":"My family and I stopped in here after a long day of traveling, and we couldn't have picked a better place! The menu is small but the dishes were awesome. Everything was fresh, full of flavor, and reasonably priced. We sat outside but the mist and shade kept us comfortable. The food, cocktails, and churro ice cream sandwich were all amazing and the service was equally as great. Wish we weren't from out of town so we could come back!"}
{"text":"I really liked the food and drinks in the beginning.
But this week when I saw a guy pre frying dozens of burgers 6am I was a bit disappointed"}
{"text":"Stopped in on our way from the Phoenix airport out to the desert. Fun, calming vibe and nice selection of fresh plates and shareables. Had the shrimp and fries (a play on fish and chips) and the ceviche salad. Ceviche salad hit the spot, lots of flavors, colors and textures and fresh. The shrimp was fried golden and crispy and the fries were yummy. Genuinely welcoming servers and staff. Nothing like being freely offered a couple of cups of water for the road. Would highly recommend and stop back when we are back in the area!"}
{"text":"We were at the Orpheum Theater and hungry when the performance was over.  Looked on Yelp and The Dressing Room came up and we headed for 220 E Roosevelt.  We could not have been more pleased.  The ambience, the food, the service was just what we wanted."}
{"text":"Great food! The battered shrimp is amazing, taste fresh! Their churro sandwich is delicious.  I will definetly eat there again."}
{"text":"All Day Burrito is deliciously amazing. Love it, Love it, Love it! I will definitely be coming back for it! Not to mention great vibes - everyone smiling and having a great time, and the intoxicating aroma of the food and coffee (from be, next door)!"}
{"text":"I have been to The Dressing Room for twice and it is one of my favorite places ever. Perfect ambience with great atmosphere. The food is always delicious and fresh with the lot of drinks options. Roro Burger and cold soda salad is my personal favorite at this place. Staff is very friendly and jovial. Highly recommend this place to everyone, you'll enjoy to the fullest I assure you."}
{"text":"It's a kitschy little place and the backstory of the name is pretty great (make sure to ask)! The burrito is my favorite. The flavors meld together well and it's very filling. Music is great and the staff is attentive and friendly. The only downside is how cramped the space is."}
{"text":"Great flavor on the burger and the fries.  Everything was well seasoned.  The burger is a bit on the messy side but very good."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for lunch! Intriguing but accessible menu- I haven't gone wrong yet. The tacos in particular, yummmmmm"}
{"text":"We just discovered a new restaurant near the University Banner Medical Center at 3rd St and Rosevelt. It is unassuming from the outside, but give it a chance! My goodness, the food was wonderful. We had the fish tacos and the Korean Yakisobi. Excellent!
Everything is made in house. The wait staff was great and the host was friendly and full of information. Definitely going to be back!"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant. I loved it. The food was food. The weather was good. The lighting was good. Everything. The only thing I didn't really enjoy is that a loud party of 6 were seated next to us. The tables are so close together...I felt like they were in my conversation and I was in theirs. Other than that....this place is great!"}
{"text":"very cool place the food is DELICIOUS! the service is awesome the waiters are very friendly and attentive. Will defintely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant downtown MOST of the time. I normally eat dinner here, but the few times I've ate lunch it has been incredibly salty. I thought it was just the fries during lunch, but I took a friend here and their burger was so salty they threw it away after two bites. I was embarrassed after talking it up so much. I'll only be here for dinner and maybe not with people who have never had it."}
{"text":"Cool little joint, great music and fab food. My boyfriend had the burger, liked it a lot (and he's picky). I had the breakfast burrito and it hit the spot. Best part was the churro ice cream sandwich, do yourself a favor and get this first!! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"I actually signed up for Yelp to post this review. Great food. The cocktails were amazing. People were friendly and very cool. Just visiting from out of town but will be back for sure before I leave."}
{"text":"After an excruciating drive to Phoenix, we were dying for some good food and cocktails. We found The Dressing Room on Yelp and it looked like it would do the trick...
What an amazing space!  The restaurant is part of a large photography studio that was once  an old warehouse space but is now a cozy, artsy hang out.  The outside patio was softly lit and cozy.  We tried several of the cocktails on the menu - they were all great.  The RoRo burger didn't disappoint and after one last drink we called it a night.  The staff was friendly and attentive and we could not have found a better restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing. The food has been incredible. We had the French Fries, OMG you have to have there fries if you come here. 

Next we have the veggie tacos. Again, just blown away at how yummy and just perfectly presented. These folks are rock stars with the food and beverages. 

I started out with the seasonal draft. It was really good. My fianc√© ordered this new drink, a cocktail they just invented, Winter Collins. You just have to come here and experience it yourself. 

You will not be sorry!

Some place do a well job. This place knocks the ball out of the park. Total home run!

Last but not least....yeah there is more. The home made churro and ice cream sandwich is to DIE for. Oh my god, I am so in my happy place right now and I'm not a big dessert fan but they once again are rock stars."}
{"text":"Nice, trendy little place. We enjoyed sitting outside on the patio eating our lunch. The staff is very friendly and also good at explaining the name and history of the restaurant. My husband and I both had hamburgers which were delicious and the fries were so good with a special seasoning. Will be checking out their happy hour since the cocktails looked so yummy!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! They tuned the music down when requested, turned on misters, turned off misters and generally made our lunch comfortable and yummy!!
We will be back!!"}
{"text":"The customer service and the food was amazing. The environment is nice and relaxed. Really enjoyed my date with my wife there. Also the food was reasonably priced. Would definitely recommend and would definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time here, I saw the good reviews on Yelp and we decided to try it out.
Loved the establishment, rustic, with modern, and a touch of art......
Good customer service, attentive, and friendly.
Fries and burgers are good, the special sauce, with a tat of spicyness, very good. 
If you're in the area, we recommended."}
{"text":"Fantastic food in a welcoming environment.  Sat at the counter and got friendly service and banter from the whole kitchen staff.  Tacos delicious as are the fries (get all 3 sauces!)."}
{"text":"Delicious food! I had the Roro burger with House chips and it was the perfect blend of flavors!! The staff was also very inviting and able to explain everything so well. The best meal I had during my trip!"}
{"text":"One of the best in the city. Loved the ceviche, loved the pickles, wife devoured the soba salad, the kids crushed the all day burrito and I swear the RoRo burger was outstanding. Beers, cocktails, happy hour and a killer staff. Churro ice cream sandwich is a great finisher. The fam cannot wait to come back. Thanks Dressing Room"}
{"text":"The Dressing room is hands down one of the best restaurants I have ever eaten at. I'm bummed they don't have anything like this in Utah, where I'm from (Please open one in Salt Lake or Provo, it would kill it). 
The RoRo burger is unreal, the drinks are super unique, and the Churro ice cream sandwich is the best dessert I've ever had. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for something new. 10/10"}
{"text":"The tacos are amazing, the burgers are exceptionaland the cocktails are to die for. The ambience is wonderful outside."}
{"text":"What cool little joint downtown... Small  menu but BIG flavor!!! I had the fish tacos and they were awesome ...crispy with  cool slaw, great pairing.. wish we had room for the dessert it looked great, next time"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a road trip after seeing the great reviews. The food was incredible. I order the Korean Yakitori and loved it. Service and environment were cool too. Would come here regularly if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. The service is great and everyone is so friendly. The veggie tacos are amazing!  The Sobe noodles are amazing!  We went Friday night and had to go back again Saturday night it was so good. Limited menu but what they do,have they do a great job with it. Keep up,the great job!  Oh and even thought they only have one dessert, it's pretty amazing too!  Churro vanilla bean gelato. Yum!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with the quality of food. The Fries were incredible and the menu was unique, but not over the top. I would definitely go again. Great date spot on the back patio"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Any time I have a meeting DT I schedule it around having lunch here! The skewers, veggie and fish tacos are all AMAZING! I love sitting at the counter and chatting with the chefs. The staff is so warm and welcoming, you get the opportunity to talk to everyone. The space is small with a great patio. I cannot wait to try everything on the menu. Oh and they have Happy Hour all day!
Please open is south Scottsdale ASAP!!"}
{"text":"Food: TJ Fish tacos and fries with Spicy Russian sauce.
The fish tacos were good and the fries were GREAT... the sauce was a nice touch. I'm a huge ketchup fan and didn't feel the need to even ask for any ketchup because the sauce was that good. 

I also ordered a gin drink called the The Snoop that was incredibly refreshing with the rest of the meal. 

Keep in mind that the fry order is HUGE... so make sure to split it."}
{"text":"This place is one of the hidden of gems of downtown Phoenix. With a quaint, modern, and laid-back atmosphere, the delicious food, topped with impeccable service easily gets this eatery a five star rating. An amazing meal, with excellent portion sizes, all at an affordable price. I'm definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"This was my second time coming to The Dressing Room. I brought my husband this time and he was equally impressed with this amazing restuarant. Everything is unique, fresh and delicious. Staff is wonderful and attentive. We even learned where the name came from!  Don't miss an opportunity to dine here....and don't skip the churro dessert!"}
{"text":"Luv this little place! The patio is fantastic as well as the music. The menu is short but interesting. I had the roro burger which was 5 star..... the fries were fantastic as well. Paloma cocktail was so tasty loved both of them"}
{"text":"Amazing! Ordered a house margarita, the shrimp and chips and finally the churro ice cream sandwich. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is hands down OUTSTANDING! I came here for a work lunch and everyone in my party was blown away. They have a smaller menu but make every single item perfectly. I had the Soba Salad with shrimp (per our awesome server's recommendation) and the others tried the burger, fish tacos, and shrimp and chips. We also got an order of fries with all 3 dipping sauces which are DELICIOUS! One meal came out incorrect and they were very quick to fix it and Brian (the owner/manager) then insisted on treating us to dessert which was a churro ice cream sandwich. It was as tasty as it sounds! You can tell Brian and his staff care a lot about this restaurant and put a ton of love into it. It seems like him and his staff are a small family who really enjoy what they do.

I can't wait to go back again and again and will be sure to tell my friends and family about this awesome gem!"}
{"text":"After reading so many great reviews about this I decided to come here and give their famous burger a try but for 10$ for a burger the only thing i liked were the fries and the special sauce they have! My burger was dry and the meat was so thick that you really couldn't conceal the dryness with sauce or anything! Maybe i just got unlucky and had a bad one but I probably wont try their burger again"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to hang out...the food is yummy..nothing fussy, but interesting and flavorful.  Great waitstaff and vibe...thank you!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious and their drinks are something to write home about.  It's super small but when the weather is nice the patio is open and it feels bigger.  We ordered hamburgers and had three of their signature drinks and everything was on point.  I would definitely come back here and would even be OK to wait if there was one."}
{"text":"I love it when a menu is small and doesn't leave room for indecision. That's what you get here, the menu is clear with no thrills. Now just because the menu is simple that doesn't mean the food is simple. Think of the food as  gourmet street food, small bites but with a twist.

I had the shrimp and chips (a play on fish and chips) the jumbo shrimp battered perfectly with seasoned fries and comes with an aioli (I asked for extra). My friends got the burger which was made with an English muffin as the bun. They didn't think they would like it but they loved it. My other buddy had the all day burrito which was also delicious!

They drinks here also come with a twist as well. I ordered the donkey which was a variation of a Moscow mule. It's an open kitchen with 4 table tops and 5 bar seats. If you decide to try this place better expect to wait."}
{"text":"My husband and I are so glad we found this place. Delicious food, helpful and attentive staff, and a very cool vibe. We also enjoyed that drinks were half off for happy hour. Fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"MUST TRY THE FRIES! I know fries are just fries but these fries are amazing. They're seasoned but not excessively salty, always piping hot, you choose a sauce from three they offer, and the huge basket is only $3. 

I get fries every time I'm here, which is often because it's right around the corner from where I live. I've had everything except the Peruvian ceviche at this point, and that's only because I'm not a fan of ceviche. My friend had it and said it was good. They have two burgers on the menu, both are good but I prefer the classic RoRo burger. They come on a warm English muffin. The fish tacos are good, as are the vegetarian (fried cheese) ones. For happy hour they have 1/2 price cocktails, I like rosemary & the sage, it's bourbon based. The yakatori was also very tasty, essentially I like the whole menu. 

Since I'm such a fan of the fries I'd suggest getting a basket and splitting an entree with a friend, this makes for a nice dinner that isn't excessively filling."}
{"text":"I did not expect this coffee shop-looking place to have such an extensive menu! This was a fun place to go for lunch and even to study. It was not too loud and had a calm atmosphere. Their all day happy hour was definitely a selling point! The server was great and got the modifications of my order right and there were plenty of vegetarian options! The manager even came to check on my table and make sure we were taken care of. Overall, I had a great experience at the Dressing Room and will surely be going back!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch last Thursday, and now it's Monday, and I have been craving it all weekend. Had the Soba Salad and it was simply delicious. Several people in my group had the All-Day Breakfast Burrito (meatless version), someone else had the veggie tacos, and everyone left happy. Some of the group had cocktails, including the one that blended Mexican Coke, iced coffee, and tequila: amazing. I can't recommend this enough. It's such a cute location, the food is delicious, and while the weather is nice, the outdoor patio is lovely. Could not be more impressed!"}
{"text":"Thanks to yelp I found this place. Loved it! Great food, different and unique. The Is a great place to hit in the evening when it's cooler outside, beautiful back patio area.

I had one of the burgers and a salad it was wonderful very flavorful nice twist on the bun it was an English muffin for bread. 

The coleslaw was amazing even if you don't like coleslaw you've got to try it it was awesome very flavorful fresh crisp crunchy."}
{"text":"I like everything about this place. Food, drinks, ambiance, and excellent service! Keep it up."}
{"text":"The Dressing Room truly exceeded my expectations. I had the Ro Ro Burger, my son had the classic hamburger and my husband had the burrito. The chef did not disappoint. Each dish was packed full of flavor, seasoned to perfection, portioned just right and reasonably priced. The service was outstanding from the time we entered the restaurant including management who made rounds checking on the guests. The Dressing Room is a must dine if you are ever in the area."}
{"text":"Great spot to hang out and enjoy something a little different. The service was good along with the music. The food left a lot to be desired the veggie tacos lacked seasoning and the fries had an over powering lemon zest flavor. I had a rum drink flavored with cinnamon almost like a rumcahata but better. I really wanted to like this spot but it needs to revamp its menu. Maybe a little more adventurous with its seasonings and flavors."}
{"text":"In town for conference, I had no idea where to go for first night's dinner. I chose the dressing room because of the distance from my hotel and the great picture of the staff arm in arm. I was able to get a great table outside to watch the sky change as I ate. Waiter was very helpful in helping me too select a beer that was not bitter. I got the TJ fish tacos and love them. The staff was incredibly attentive and the atmosphere was perfect for a single lady like myself and the many small groups that I saw. I look forward to visiting The Dressing Room again the next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I had the cold soba salad with shrimp as add on. Great flavor and mix of items in it. I broke down and had the churro ice cream sandwich which was also very good. Service was quick and friendly. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The best meal I had in Phoenix on my trip! The veggie tacos have such a depth of flavor you don't even miss the meat. The fries have a light seasoning that was very very good!"}
{"text":"What a great find ... food was delicious (check out the RoRo Burger) and service was lightning fast ... we sat at the bar, so that probably helped.  Service staff was very friendly and helpful, and drinks were excellent.  

We were there in June, however, which is dead in Phoenix, but it was still crowded (which is why we ended up at the bar), so my only concern would be that it must get crazy-jammed when the weather cools down and ASU is back in session ... you will want to call ahead to check wait time ... otherwise, this place is a \"10\""}
{"text":"very impressed with this little place.

We walked over from my friends downtown condo and upon arrival were quickly greeted and seated in the patio.  Our server was great: friendly, chill, and quick.

I had the RoRo burger which was delicious.  That english muffin bread idea is the best ever!  Our tostadas with both the pico and the ceviche appetizers were perfectly crunchy and freshly fried and salted.. yummmm.  My friends cheese tacos were ginormous but they looked very yummy from my angle :P

We had their grapefruit cocktail for $5 which was a SUPER deal.. I think I had two???

I really appreciated that the owner or manager or whoever the two men were, stopped by and not just asked how we were but legitimately had an enjoyable two-way conversation with us... that was really nice to feel that welcomed.  

I came back a second time and had the tacos and very very much enjoyed them as a light lunch... we will def be back again, friends!"}
{"text":"I really, really liked this place. It was so cute and cozy, the service was amazing and the food was absolutely delicious! The prices are also great for the portions. We were able to meet the manager, who was so friendly and you could tell that he took pride in this restaurant. We tried their ceviche, fish and chips and salad. All three were so good. Can't wait to go back to this place again!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Great service. We got the roro burger and veggie tacos and then churro ice cream sandwich for desert. All three were delicious. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. Chill comfortable environment. Will definitely be coming back here"}
{"text":"We've been to The Dressing Room a couple of times to hang out and have really enjoyed it! The first time we were there, we didn't realize they have a long Happy Hour (from 11am - 6pm) featuring 1/2 off wine, beer, and cocktails; we've gone back since to take advantage of the deal!

I've enjoyed the C&V Paloma every time - Tequila, Fresh Grapefruit, Lime, Vanilla, and Cinnamon - super delish & quite refreshing especially for the summer! They also have a non-alcholic drink, the Chicha Morada, listed as a Homemade Peruvian spiced purple corn drink which is tasty & also refreshing.

Their food menu is smaller but we've liked the items we've gotten so far - TJ Tacos, RoRo Burger, and Shrimp & Chips. The TJ Tacos have been my favorite; the fish was fried crispy and the cabbage, pico, and avocado crema were the perfect toppings. Highly recommended! I liked the Shrimp due the batter they were fried in but that wasn't my favorite. My husband liked the RoRo Burger, it was packed with the toppings which made it tasty. Their fries are seasoned with tajin & come with a choice of side sauce which are good too!

The only drawback is that the inside of the restaurant is small, not ideal for a large group. They do have more seating on their patio however! Overall, cute little place worth stopping by."}
{"text":"Pretentious hipster joint. Menu looks good on paper but my mid rare burger came out medium at best, with fries so salty that I wonder if they actually spilled the salt on them. The staff is nice enough but pretty clueless. I doubt they have much experience. I'm not surprised but I hoped for more."}
{"text":"We were lucky to catch their happy hour. Very cool, lively, and hip atmosphere.  I ordered the Beer Battered fish taco mixed with thinly sliced purple and white cabbage.  It was delicious very light and fresh. My fianc√© got the Roro burger with a side salad for $10. It was tasty and it was a good portion to share! The dressing that we had for the side salad was a coconut lime dressing. It was light and fresh. Loved it!!

In the same building, there's an attached art gallery to walk around and the coffee shop. Very cute spot.  Friendly customer service.  We just had to wait a while for our check, otherwise everything was good."}
{"text":"It's great what they have done sith this spot, which was a gay hustler bar a long time ago, then sat empty for many years. They decor is modern yet maintains the rustic appeal of the original building. The far wall they have opened up into the adjoining space, which includes seating in the art gallery and allows ventilation and sound dispersion. Brilliant! 
The service was very friendly and unpretentious. Great music. The Roro burgers and fries were exceptional and fresh. The draft beer and cocktail selection was also great for such a small place. The enclosed back patio, adjacent to the food-prep trailer, would be great during cooler weather. Overall, this gem is a great addition to the Roosevelt Row area."}
{"text":"Going to lunch on a Friday with coworkers so we wanted something different, unique and close. Yelp brought us to this place. I had the TJ Tacos and they were really good and the cr√®me sauce very tasty, it did just need a bit of sriracha and it was perfect. My coworkers had the classic burger and the All Day burrito. Both of them said theirs was excellent and one of them is a picky eater so it must have been good. I tried the fries that came with the burger and they were great! Salty, but not too salty and a unique flavor that was good. Kinda of a dill flavor but not a pickle flavor. I will get those on the side next time because my fish tacos did not have any. :( The vibe was cool and hip. Loved that you can see them make your food. It was a very small place so it was a bit loud but we could still hear each other talk. The waitress, I dont' remember her name, was a crackup and the staff, over all, were pretty attentive. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, such a great addition to Roosevelt. The menu is limited but it's everything you'd want. I had the Peruvian Ceviche Salad and it was very fresh and filling! The best part is the daily happy hour. Half off all drinks! But above all our waitress Michelle was very attentive and welcoming and the manager Zack was also great. Super hands on and got us anything we needed. Seriously can't say enough good things about this restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the best additions to the dining scene in DT PHX --- small quaint little restaurant with a small outdoor back patio. Has a unique alt vibe. Great place to go for a small bite and a drink (esp. during happy hour where all drinks are half off). $3 tostada and pico has been great both times I've been there --- ask for some avocado crema on the side (+0.50). Miso slaw ($3) also a winner. Fish tacos and soba noodles were spot on. This is a place I'll most definitely be returning to despite the many dining options downtown."}
{"text":"The vegetable tacos were amazing! As were the fries with avocado dip.  Really neat environment too!"}
{"text":"After a day of wandering and exploring downtown Phoenix, I found my way into The Dressing Room. A cool spot with a very cool vibe. I sat out on the back patio, ordered the Classic Burger and proceeded to fall in love. It was amazing. The ingredients were all wonderfully simple and came together to make one of the best burgers I've ever had. I was so fucking happy eating every last piece. I can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"First time here! Service was great and the food & drinks were delicious! We went with the veggie tacos & Paloma for drink... we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"First time visiting the Dressing Room and I will be a repeat customer. Half price cocktails all day on Saturday and the drinks were very unique and delicious. The food was very good. I had the veggie tacos and loved them. They were more fried cheese than veggies but I didn't mind because I love cheese!  The fries with the aioli dipping sauce were so good. The service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"We found this place while traveling through town and decided to have lunch. Two adults two kids what a great little place! First of all the French fries are amazing! And they sauces they serve with them are out of this world. My kids loved the shrimp tacos that had a few large shrimp on each one! Yummy! We will for sure be stopping in again! Maybe this time without kiddos for some drinks!             


Ok... went are back and with the kids for a late lunch awesome relaxing time on the Patio. Just glad this place is in Phoenix and not tucson since I would be eating here way too much! Great place!"}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say about this place definately go here the food the ambience and the art will blow your mind but the vibe will make you feel at home. Menu is short sweet and delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"I have had my eye on this place for awhile...not gonna lie it was solely due to I heard they had a churro ice cream sandwich. So we sat on the patio, and it's got a really cool urban vibe, I over heard someone say it's called the dressing room because it used to be a dressing room for a drag show/bar which I thought was cool. Now to the good stuff...the menu is small but I feel like they are very creative and what they do have they do extremely well .....consistency is key  I had the classic burger and I didn't have time to take a picture because I was busy stuffing it in my face, it was delicious. I also had the spiked chai which was also very good...and very strong  my husband had the big burrito..eggs, bacon, potatoes, corn and cheese...he was in heaven...all his favorite things in burrito form. Last but DEFINITELY not least, the churro ice cream sandwich....I can only say it's a delicious experience....that's it no other words. Run don't walk to the dressing room, you can thank me later."}
{"text":"I'll talk about food and drinks in a minute, but let me just say we had the most attentive and helpful server ever! He made an average happy hour fantastic. 

Anyway, the happy hour deals here can't be missed - half off everything basically - so we stopped by for drinks and a snack before dinner. We ordered the fries which came with a sauce, and the four of us ordered drinks. We particularly enjoyed the spiked chai and the peppered flower, though one of my friends' chai was way too strong (too much rum). We convinced her to ask for a little more chai concentrate to go in it, and our server obliged, which made it much better. 

We ordered more fries (they were delicious, but we definitely needed more for the four of us, and the baskets were cheap) and without asking, our server brought us all three sauces instead of just one, possibly because he heard that we could decide which one we really wanted. Overall this was a really great way to spend happy hour with friends. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic and represents everything what a DTPHX spot should be! The trifecta, really --- 1) great cocktails 2) great service 3) great atmosphere. Oh, the music was on point, too. 

Super friendly and accommodating staff/bartender (as in not so much as an involuntary shudder nor flinch when we asked for our drinks made slightly differently). The craft cocktails are delicious and half off during happy hour. Also, BIG ICE CUBES. I ordered the cold soba salad which was flavorful fresh and healthy - an excellent post aerial yoga snack - the cocktails? Not so much, but HEY, live a little! 

We sat outside on the patio on an unseasonably beautiful day overlooking this handsome, rusty shipping container kitchen. The unisex (multisex? gender neutral?) bathroom was sexy, too. Modern and clean."}
{"text":"If you have a small menu, you have to do it right... and The Dressing Room does it right! This was only the second time we ate here and it was as good as we remembered. It's a small place with an open kitchen and a very chill downtown Phoenix vibe. Our server, Taylee, was great, super attentive and very sweet. The drink menu is brief, but good, interesting drinks without going too wacky. And the food... oh the food. I think the RoRo burger is my favorite burger in the valley. Perfect combination of tang, spice and a delicious patty. The fries are cooked so well and have a very interesting and tasty seasoning. You can order them with an aioli that takes it to another level. The only dessert option is the churro ice cream sandwich. It is so good that you won't want any other option anyway. Two cookie shaped, well made churros with delicious ice cream in between. Basically, I'm already dreaming about going back!"}
{"text":"The Peppered Flower drink is delicious! Also, ordered TJ Taco & Veggie Taco. Dan is the man! Attentive, accommodating, & hospitable. I couldn't leave without trying their Rosemary & Sage drink. That too is deliciously dangerous and I don't care for Bourbon but WOW! So good! I haven't needed to use my AirPods, which I love! Because their eclectic music playlist is great! From Tupac, Ice Cube, to alternative. . . it's shuffled. Plus, the free WiFi is on point!"}
{"text":"This wonderful place was recommended by Julia at The Bee's Knees. Our lunch was terrific - shared the RoRo Burger & the mixed street tacos, which had 1 fish & 1 veggie taco. All were excellent. Amanda was very helpful & informative about other local things to do in the area."}
{"text":"YUM. Their Paloma drink was perfection! Fish tacos were pretty good but the cabbage slaw they used was a bit bitter. Overall still better than most fish tacos I've had here in the valley. Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"The BF and I were looking for an alternative to the quirky but highly-crowded Welcome Diner. Decided to give this little place a try based on the Yelp reviews and the short but interesting-looking and reasonably-priced menu, and we were not steered wrong.  Went in about an hour before closing on a Sunday evening and decided to sit out in the patio to take advantage of the balmy 80¬∫ weather.  The server was attentive and helpful.  The BF had the shrimp & chips - the batter was light and crispy, the aioli was tangy, and the chips were well-done, just as the BF likes them.  I had the Cold Soba Salad; lots of interesting flavors which went well together, very refreshing.  I also allowed myself to be talked into adding a skewer of the Korean Yakitori - the meat was rich, tender, and flavorful.  The BF also enjoyed his Pineapple Ginger Beer Agua Fresca.  WE SHALL RETURN!!!"}
{"text":"First time here. We sat out on the patio, it was a nice day for that. There are heaters outdoors just in case though. The server was pleasant but he seemed to be too over excited about the food. We ordered the fries with avocado crema to dip the fries in. Both were very good.
We also decided to try the pickles because server said they were amazing........not so. Tasted like butter chip pickles out of a jar. The pineapple non-alcoholic drink was not all that,tasted like watered down pineapple juice with too much ginger. I ordered the prime rib salad with peanut sauce. Again for the price there should have been more meat, it too was so-so. My husband had the fish tacos, that really smelled fishy, to me that's a sign of old fish.
With some changes to these two dishes it could be \"amazing\" to try again, but I don't think we'll be returning. They are dog friendly if you sit out on patio....to me that's a plus!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. I had the RoRoBurger and got the fries with Avo Crema. I also had a Chicha Mirada. The burger was fantastic medium rare. The toasted English muffin worked really well as the bun and the flavors came together really well. The place has nice outdoor patio seating. Parking was ample in the back for this area. He interior is shared with a coffee house, plant shop, art gallery, and co-working space. Very interesting concept."}
{"text":"OMG!  Came into Phoenix for my daughter's volleyball tournament. Was looking for a place to grab something to bring back to the room; saw this place and decided to try it. I got the special (don't know the name of it) but it is a Korean fried rice with shrimp, chilies and an egg on top. The flavors all work together to spice it up to just the right amount. The heat is just at the right level that should suit most people. Luckily this is our first night here because I will be a regular while I am here. The only negative I have is that we are from Los Angeles so when the craving for this dish hits me, it's going to be a long drive!  (But will be worth it)!"}
{"text":"I came here for an early lunch by myself during the week and was greeted by the friendly staff. It was pretty cool they had a nice back patio area for seating and was connected to a coffee place, art gallery, and greenery shop. The atmosphere was hip and laid back. The place was very clean and the service was quick and friendly. The menu is short and sweet, but with creative twists and flavors. I had the RoRo burger and fries and was blown away! Definitely a cheat meal/ very heavy, but worth the splurge. Super juicy and saucy. The English muffin bun definitely makes the burger hold up well. Fries are crispy, fresh, and the chili salt seasoning made the meal extra fun. I ordered the Korean yakatori  meal to go for the hubby and loved it! Will Be back to check out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"This restaurant was everything the reviews said. The food was amazing. I got the fish tacos and they were so good and filling. I ate some of the fries from my husbands plate and the seasoning they put on them was so good. The service was fantastic. Our server answer all our questions and made some excellent recommendations. My three kids even loved the food. Definitely would eat here again if we come back to Phoenix and I would recommend anyone. So yummy!!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic restaurant! Incredible atmosphere, great music, amazing staff, everything! What I love is the overall excellence and attention to detail. From the spotless kitchen, to the cocktails, everything! The Dressing Room's standard is Excellence, & they deliver it on every level! Thankful for our fantastic server Evelyn, the kind manager Brian, & the staff as a whole! Keep up the great work everyone! We'll be back soon with some new faces!"}
{"text":"Impressed with this little joint. Came here late night and had some great tasting bloody Mary's... Tacos are great and portion size was respectable. 

I will be back soon. 

- Alfie"}
{"text":"Really cool restaurant. Attached to an art gallery, coffee shop, and plant store. The building is very artsy and unique. I have only been to the dressing room for drinks but had a great peanut butter ported for only $3. I definitely plan on going back soon."}
{"text":"The resto has cool factor because it's a historic space, and the branding is appropriate. I enjoyed the space, and the attentive service. The servers were on point and even when busy, available. The food was not spectacular, it's sophisticated bar food after all. The Avo Crema does deserve some accolades, it enhanced the fries, although the fries were great alone. The RoRoBurger was decent, wished they asked for my preference on how I wanted my burger cooked but it was okay. 

Now, the cocktails were special, and happy hour runs until 6 PM and they are half-off. There are 4 beers on the menu, so, the drink menu is more oriented towards specialty cocktails. I enjoyed their version of a Moscow Mule, this was with grapefruit juice and The Snoop, which was gin based with an orange type liqueur. Both were refreshing, and complemented my dinner experience. I love this place is around, and if you're in need of parking, their parking lot is behind the park on Roosevelt on 2nd Street (NE corner)."}
{"text":"Was visiting Phoenix and decided to try The Dressing Room.  The only negative part was sitting right by the door at the bar.  Luckily the cook was very friendly.  The Burrito was good but the salsa was even better.  Would definitely come often if lived in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I was in downtown Phoenix last night and ended up at the dressing room. The restaurant is not the easiest to find when your in a car and actually it's not really parking friendly either but I managed to find a parking spot nearby. The restaurant is small and has dining inside and on the patio.  There's a small open visible kitchen and attached coffee shop as well. Now for the food. I had the roro burger and it was incredible! It's the first burger I've ever had on an English muffin. The homemade thousand island was just as incredible. I washed this meal down with a glass of homemade lemonade! 

So if your in downtown Phoenix and your looking for a place to get a nice healthy meal try the dressing room. You won't leave disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. There are not a lot of menu options but everything on the menu is done exceptionally well. I got the Roro Burger with fries and the avo crema (avocado crema). The burger comes on an english muffin and it is the perfect vessel to carry the burger and have it soak up all the meat juices. The fries are well seasoned with a pleasant kick and the avo creama, which is similar to ranch, is a perfect dipping sauce for the fries. We sat outside and they had the misters on to keep us cool. The wait staff is really kind and friendly. I was overall really impressed with the establishment and will def. be back to try their dessert menu out. There is nothing that i could think of that could improve upon which is rare! Fine job!!!"}
{"text":"I recently had lunch here and really enjoyed my experience! I love the overall vibe, the food was great, and the staff were incredibly nice and attentive. I love that I was able to bring one of my clients here but also would be able to bring friends and family. I highly recommend the fish tacos! They were delicious."}
{"text":"I had a delicious lunch at The Dressing Room on Tuesday! I had stopped into Be coffee, food, and stuff {same owner} to work for a little bit and when I got hungry, decided to try it's BRAND NEW sister restaurant next door! There is a door connecting the two places which it totally cool. I LOVE the decor, cute little patio, and great little bar where you can watch the chefs cook. It is pretty small so not great for big groups but definitely good for a date night or client lunch! They have Happy Hour specials EVERY DAY from 11 AM - 6 PM with half off of cocktails. How can you beat that?! And let me tell you, the cocktail menu looked incredible! 

For lunch, I ordered their cold soba salad with a Yakitori steak skewer because they looked so tasty. The salad was nice and refreshing! It had pickled cucumbers, ginger, carrots, onions, sesame seeds, a soft boiled egg, avocado, seaweed, and i'm sure i'm missing things! It was topped with a light miso dressing. It was a TAD fishy for me but this isn't saying much because i'm super sensitive to fishy things. It is probably supposed to be this way! THE SKEWER - YES. The flavor was incredible and I will 100% order these the next time that I come. So yum! 

All in all, this is a great new addition to the Downtown Phoenix foodie scene! Definitely pay them a visit!"}
{"text":"This was my boyfriends- All time Favorite best breakfast burrito he has ever had. We enjoyed everything about this local spot. Fresh ingredients and delicious taste!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It's small and cozy and we enjoyed sitting on the patio and watching passersby. Great attention to detail - fresh flower twigs on the tables and speakers in the trees. Staff was friendly and the food was amazing. We got drinks on happy hour -$5 cocktails. We had the whiskey rosemary. It was well made and refreshing. The soba noodle salad was as amazing as the juicy burger.  I loved the English muffin bun. Their fries were also delicious served with specialty dipping sauce. High food quality and reasonably priced. We will visit again."}
{"text":"For those of you who've been to such valley staples as Welcome Diner, 32 Shea, or one of the numerous valley Dutch Bros Coffee stops, you know firsthand how great things can emanate from small spaces.  The kitchen might be small, the menu might be limited, but even small but mighty spaces like these can leave you with a great impression.  I invite you to add another space to that list.  Opened just a day before my first appearance here, the guys at Conceptually Social have added a second Roosevelt Row restaurant to their repertoire in the form of The Dressing Room.  A small but mighty restaurant concept bringing what they're calling \"elevated global street food\" to the masses.

Located right next door to Conceptually Social's first restaurant incarnation Be Coffee (a wildly popular Roosevelt Row hub inside the equally popular MonOrchid), The Dressing Room is a tiny interior space with seating for maybe 16 inside.  The kitchen up front doubles as the bar and today was manned by an impressively bearded California transplant named Parker and his staff.  There is also a patio out back with shaded seating for close to 30 (something I'm sure will get usage as the weather warms back up).  The building also opens up to the Be Coffee space for overflow interior seating if needed.

The menu, despite being less than extensive really does cover a wide culinary geography.  You'll find American, Mexican, Peruvian, Korean, and even Japanese items on the docket.  The drink menu has more of an American tilt, but nevertheless incorporates a number of international flavors where possible.  For my drink, I went with the Cold Weather going with the theme of this unusually cold day in the Phoenix area.  This one has a slightly Italian flare with some Aperol mixed in with Bourbon, Ginger Beer and a couple of fruit flavors.  For my first entree, I'm on Roosevelt Row so it must be the RoRo Burger.  Gruyere Cheese, Russian Dressing, Bacon, and caramelized onions with an english muffin substituting for a bun.  And the fries, interestingly, were doused not with salt but with tajin mexican seasoning.  Really excellent burger (particularly the Russian dressing) and I liked the different spin on the fries.  For dessert, there is currently just one menu item to choose from as I write this, but it will undoubtedly get the attention of anyone who reads it the first time around.  The Churro Ice Cream Sandy is a vanilla ice cream sandwich with little round churro disks on the top and bottom (and these literally have the taste and texture of true churros).  This thing was delicious, but a mess.  I would probably recommend cutting the sandwich with a knife and spooning up the goodness from there.  Or if you don't care about the mess, grab it with two hands and go nuts.  I doubt they'll judge.

Total cost for the drink, burger, dessert, tax and tip came to about $26.  Much like their sister restaurant Be Coffee, The Dressing Room's menu is reasonably priced and approachable.  The staff is laid back and the artwork on the walls is quintessentially Roosevelt Row.  The location is primed for the First Friday crowds that will undoubtedly flood in before long.  And their late night hours will be a big boost to the late night crowds that frequent this neighborhood.  So cheers to the folks at Conceptually Social.  Two restaurants, two big hits.  What small wonder will they come up with next?"}
{"text":"Really awesome space and concept, add food and cocktails and you've got a pretty perfect spot. I've had the coffee, also delicious and some light breakfast fare and was not let down! Dressing room is reminiscent of restaurants you'd find in other well established foodie cities: L.A, San Fran, Seattle, and New York. It's refreshing to have a slice of that here in Phoenix in a beautiful downtown space. Definitely will stop for dinner and cocktails again soon."}
{"text":"First time trying this place was a nice experience. The service was outstanding. I forgot her name but when we got to talking she said she was there from opening..great job girl! Small, cute place, front and back outdoor seating. Small menu, but I had a feeling what ever we had would've been great! One of the best burgers ever..and fries! I had the paloma cocktail, also great! I would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Walked over here from the Art Studio.  This place is definitely for the young trendy kids. I purchase a burger, that was on a English muffin. Kind of strange, however it was good. Now their fries they are really good. Two of my fellow artist went over after seeing my food. They both like it too. They give a lot of fries so you can definitely share. Once you taste them.. well you might not. And  end up keeping them for yourself."}
{"text":"In from out of town staying at a swanky resort in Scottsdale and have been to Phoenix for work a few times in the past.  We were looking to get off the resort and go to a unique cool local joint as I love supporting the local businesses.  Well, Yelpers you did not disappoint!!!

Here is what I can add to the previous reviews...and I met the owner while I was here...this place has only been open since January 2017 and the main issue they had (space) has been resolved. Hang out at the bar and watch the chefs do their manic, sit outside or find a quite space in the attached coffee shop or art gallery. 

The happy hour deal is UNREAL... 1/2 price for all drinks for 7 hours...how can you go wrong???  Not to mention their normal prices won't gauge you once happy hour ends. The food menu is limited BUT it is delicious. We were greeted by Amanda as soon as we walked in and we were watched over by all other servers as well.  We had the fries as an appetizer and Tostitos and home made salsa and they were yummy (ask for a side of their house sauce as well.)  I'm a craft beer kinda guy so I loved that their was no bud light or coors light kind of beers available.  We then ordered their all day burrito and it was yummy as well.  I stuck with the craft beer selections and my wife tried their wine and a few of their mixed drinks and they were all delicious. 

This place markets itself as a glorified food truck on steroids and seating and they certainly accomplished that. If I am back in town, I will certainly visit it again."}
{"text":"Love this place ... churros with ice cream are my perfect dessert .. took family and they enjoy the food .. specially mom. Great patio, great service ... recommended"}
{"text":"I wish I could rate Food & Service separately because the FOOD was absolutely AMAZING and deserves 5 STARS!! I got the RoRo Burger...hands down the best burger I've ever had. Fries were a little over seasoned but still pretty dang good. But...

The service was terrible. Everyone working seemed pissed cause the small quarters and they were way over staffed. The servers were grumpy, all of them. Snappy to each other about taking things out to tables and where orders have went. 

The charming thing about this restaurant is the small quarters, so the servers need to remember that it is SMALL and to leave their attitudes at the door. The servers have a chance to really create an awesome experience and unfortunately, they really ruined mine. But that burger will definitely have me coming back for more!"}
{"text":"What a find!  After spending some time downtown, the family decided to Yelp It! for lunch and we stumbled on The Dressing Room. We're so lucky we did!

The menu has just enough option for most tastes, and honestly everything looked good to me.  We had the Korean Yakatori Skewers, All Day Burrito, Fish Tacos, and the Soba Salad.  All 4 meals were fantastic. We can wait to get back!"}
{"text":"Roro burger is amazing.  

10/10 get it.

I've been here at least 20 times and the burger is always amazing."}
{"text":"Such an amazing gem!  Happened to stop by for their crazy happy hour and enjoyed delicious cocktails for half price as well as extremely well prepared, tasty food. Limited menu but what they do offer is done so well."}
{"text":"This was our first time dining at The Dressing Room. We had the classic burger, veggie taco, Korean Yakitori and the churro ice cream sandwich the burger with the house made pickles on a English muffin was beyond as was the veggie tacos with sweet potatoes Peruvian corn and fried Mexican cheese!!! So good. But what really took the cake was the chorro with vanilla bean gelato.  I also have to shoutout the owner for being so awesome and genuine. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"This is my second time at The Dressing Room. Every time I've come here I've had the pleasure of being served by Morgan. She is extremely accommodating and always made sure sure we were attended to. The manager Zach also checked in on us multiple times. The drinks he recommended were excellent! The best part was that they were half off. The happy hour deal was half off all drinks 11-6 every day which is amazing. The tacos were phenomenal as well. If you are looking for a quick lunch or dinner this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect. The RoRo Burger is one of the best burgers I've ever had. The service was awesome. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"100% the place to come when you are coming downtown (from Scottsdale!) and want super fresh creative dinner in a cool atmosphere. Break out! We did!"}
{"text":"Great Quaint restaurant. friendly customer service, and fantastic food I love their happy hour! Great place to visit if you're downtown."}
{"text":"The Churro ice cream sandwich, to die for. An absolute game changer and Churros will never be the same."}
{"text":"Spending the day in Phoenix. Came across this wonderful quaint restaurant. Everyone was sooo nice, the atmosphere was great, and the food was delicious. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We were so excited to see another cool cocktail bar open in our neighborhood!  We stopped in for happy hour a few Friday nights ago and had a great experience.  The place is quite small, but we were fortunate to snag a table on the patio.  Their happy hour consists of half off drinks from 11-6 - highly recommend the $5 Donkeys (amazingly refreshing).  We also had a side of fries with the spicy russian sauce...so tasty!"}
{"text":"I haven't tried a single thing that I don't like. I've also tried every drink except 2. The happy hour times and days are the perfect. Its the main reason we keep coming.  We order twice as much. Haha. Loooove this place"}
{"text":"This appears to be a hip spot near downtown Phoenix for the foodie types. I did not care for the menu choices hence my low rating. Quality is probably better than here stars, but I was not interested in returning after my dinner. I do not eat cows, and I was not in the mood for seafood, so I was stuck with some veggie tacos. 

Your best bet is to come with a mild appetite and someone you would like to have a few cocktails with. If you can drink and split a basket of fries, you might love the place. Fries here are among the best I ever ate -- crispy, well seasoned, and appropriately splashed with tangy vinegar. 

The tacos I had were not good. There was a fried block of cheese in each one. They were filled with chunks of sweet potato, or at least I think it was. 

The patio was delightful with flora and art. There is a gallery of some sort attached to the indoor seating area with a coffee shop in between."}
{"text":"Bomb food.  Go for Sunday brunch.  Half off booze.  Great service.  Their breakfast burrito and roro burger are both real delish.  Cocktail game on point.  Especially their Bloody"}
{"text":"This place has a great breakfast burrito and the salsa is even better! The service was great, everyone worked together to service our table, and they were awesome. Fun, hip, small but great location. Only reason I gave 4 stars is because of parking, they don't make it clear there is parking in the back. Maybe include this on your location page on your website. Other than that, fantastic job! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"HIDDEN TREASURE!  Staff is super friendly, drinks are great and the food is the bomb !  Lots of vegetarian options.  I love the all day burrito, but fish tacos are a close second!  Back patio is awesome!"}
{"text":"Well thought out menu with excellent execution. The staff was great and very attentive and the atmosphere is very cool."}
{"text":"Whooow... great chill spot to hit in central Phoenix. Patio was awesome and the food fantastic.  We had a couple great cocktails, rosemary and sage Bourbon, and then a Moscow mule version they call The Donkey!  Both excellent.  I had read that the fries were a must, and they delivered.  Crunchy with a slight malt vinegar flavor. Not overwhelming, very good.  I had the Ro Ro Burger on one heck of an awesome English muffin. We also had the fish tacos, excellent... and beer battered shrimp with fries.  Shrimp was great but not something I'd go back for with so much other good stuff on the menu to try. 

We also had stellar service from Michelle and were pleasantly surprised when Brian the Director of Concepts for the Dressing Room stopped by to say hi.  Only took a minute to figure out these guys are the real deal, succeeding at delivering a great experience with quality food! Well done Brian and team. 

Note: Also found out they own the little coffee shop attached to the Dressing Room with some killer B'fast items. Not full service B'fast but enough selection to enjoy a variety of things.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Kudos on the giant Boba Fett painting that greets you when you enter this place! :)

Loved the Peruvian Ceviche Salad and my friend was very fond of her order of the TJ Tacos. Definitely have to go back to try out other dishes and have another go at the ceviche salad - so delicious!"}
{"text":"This place was so cool! The outside ambience was sting lighting, a trailer where they prepare the food, a colorful mural, and tables and benches with umbrellas. It was one of my favorite stops on my 27 hour road trip. The food was so good and affordable. The shrimp with the shrimp and chips was battered lightly and fluffy. The food was great portions. My sister had fish tacos and loved it. The waiter was friendly, efficient, and patient. I did get the signature churro ice cream sandwich. It was not my favorite but who cares this place rocks. Service rocks. Food rocks. Phoenix has a scent jem. The inside was tiny and reminded me of a speak easy. They have outdoor bathrooms. You should try it!"}
{"text":"Love the dressing room! What a great addition to the tasty eateries downtown. It was a group of four and we were seated immediately on a Thursday evening. I ordered the breakfast burrito which was enormous and packed with deliciousness. Others ordered the burger which was just as good, fish and chips, and everyone ordered drinks. Drinks were really good and strong. Staff was fast and the manager even came by to thank us for coming. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I'd give 10 stars if I could. The Roro burger was out of this world perfect delicious awesome amazing mouthwatering insane yummy 10/10. The burger is so juicy and seasoned really well so that it just totally makes your mouth water. The cheese is tasty but not too in your face and the dressing/sauce on it is perfect. The bacon was insanely bacon-y, super salty and crispy af - I'd recommend for meat lovers 100%. I am not a big meat guy (1-2x weekly) so it really hit the spot for me :) 

The fries were also worth a trip. Seasoned so well and I got the avocado crema to go with and it was one of my favorite things ever. Also the lemonade was bomb as well! 

Great spot and I will definitely be back. This burger is seriously everything!! Id recommend trying this spot to any and all burger lovers! It's a small space but perfect for a solo meal. The service was super friendly and everything was really awesome about my experience"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! We sat on the patio in the back with great music playing and the weather was perfect! It set the tone perfectly. Ordered the Donkey and Palomar drinks and they were delicious. The Donkey is going to be their own version of a mule, and they nailed it. So delicious! For food, we ordered the ceviche which was very tasty with all the different flavors. I'm not much of a fried person, but the shrimp was also really good. I'm so happy to have tried this place, I live down the street and it took me forever. They servers were also really nice, I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My brother came to town from LA and we wanted to try something new and close to downtown.  He ordered the Roro burger and I ordered a classic burger. The orders can with fries. It was amazing. We were actually sad when we got done eating our food and debating to order another one. I've never seen my brother lick his fingers after eating either . We will definitely come back and try the rest of their menu. The staff was very polite and friendly.  If you haven't been here you shouldn't wait any longer."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this little gem in the Roosevelt row arts District. Highly recommend the breakfast burrito and the fries and the bloody Mary and pretty much everything else on the menu is delicious. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Customer service was a solid 5 stars. And food quality was a solid .5
I ordered the shrimp and chips, and my girlfriend ordered the burrito. For 9 dollars I was expecting a bit more than 5 small shrimp, let alone on a plastic diner plate. Wish they had the traditional fish n ships w a twist , something worth the buck and not on a plastic basket plate w parchment. 
Girlfriends burrito; not impressed at all, unfortunately. 8 dollars for a small burrito with cheese that was clearly the Kraft processed individually wrapped slices of cheese. They had large kernels of corn in the burrito that were a little funky. If they did away w the corn maybe they'd have a little more for better cheese. 
At the end the owner kindly stopped by and asked about the meal, we let him know we weren't too satisfied. He listened to our feedback and had us try an excellent churro ice cream sandwich, which was again served on a plastic basket. 
It's a beautiful corner, beautiful space, just doesn't seem as much effort was given to to production to the food rather the ambiance. 
Will return again in hopes ownership sees this and makes adjustments."}
{"text":"Best burger seriously in town - Great patio great beer (peanut butter - yes! Amazing) - homemade fries homemade chips ---- the extreme bomb! This place is 5+ - just hard to find - go around and park off of 3rd st off the road. Seriously amazing!"}
{"text":"This was a nice surprise! Great food, love the look and feel of the place. Very cozy. I had the Burger (not the classic), can't remember the name of it, but it was delicious with extra bacon (see my pics)! The fries were great and crispy all the sauces were really good. You'll love it!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Great atmosphere and the food is really tasty! The menu is very small but the food is always done right. We had the burrito, veggie tacos, and fries. All three were amazing. The servers were super attentive and happy hour drinks are 1/2 off! Recently they extended the seating around the corner into the area occupied by a coffee shop and gallery- good move!"}
{"text":"I recently met some friends here for dinner. I was surprised at how small this place is, but we were able to seat a party of 6. I wouldn't take a larger party than that here though. The atmosphere is dark and kind of quirky. The music was somewhat loud in my opinion. However, the service was great and so was the food. The menu is very small, not a lot of choices in terms of what to eat. I got the Roro burger and I would definitely recommend it to anyone. It was delicious. Also the fries were phenomenal! They put a seasoning on the fries that is very tasty. My husband got the fish tacos and enjoyed them. We also tried the pickles and they were very good. I think overall everyone was happy with their food."}
{"text":"Been there 4 times already!! Food is good everyone is friendly. The Churro Ice Cream Sandwich is to die for."}
{"text":"It was a cute place with a nice environment but I wish there were more options on the menu! The churro ice cream sandwich is a must"}
{"text":"I walked into the resturant proper, made eye contact with who later turned out to be the manager on duty, but was never welcomed. Despite that it looked just like the pics on Yelp, I thought that I might have the wrong spot  or that the counter to order was elsewhere cause no one acknowledged me. When I walked thru to the coffee shop (which I realize used to be Songbird) the dude was super helpful. He acknowledged me with a \"Good Morning\" and \"welcome\" before asking me what I wanted. I told him it was my first time there since the change. He IMMEDIATELY BROKE down the concept: coffee, breakfast stuff over here, food truck-style yummies on the other side. Now mind you, NEITHEr space was full--they weren't even to 1/2 capacity. Regardless, it wasn't until AFTER walked back through to the resturant, placed my bag in the chair, and proceeded to sit that a shorter gentlemen with an auburn goatee said, \"So you'll be dinning with u?\" I thought it ironic given how he was the first person I made eye contact w/upon entering and subsequently watched direct staff. Perhaps the most frustrating and disappointing part of this experience was sitting at the bar, just 1 seat from the door, and watching how each person following me was greeted with excitement, welcomed, and encouraged to stay by the manager on duty, the bartender, and the cook--basically, the front of the house crew. 

The food was good, and my server was on point--if the unconscious bias shown me by the front crew was the norm than my server broke the monotony. I can't say I'll speak bad about this place, but like Rotten Grapes and Joe's Diner, it will not be
 a place volunteer my money."}
{"text":"I ordered the Classic burger and it was perfectly delicious. It really went beyond your basic hamburger. The meat was cooked just right, it had the perfect bun, fresh pickles, tomatoes and lettuce. Everything came together to satisfy the taste buds. Plus the service was friendly and efficient. If you're in the area, I highly recommend you stop by."}
{"text":"The food and drinks are amazing. The happy hour is awesome and I hope it stays this good forever. Every single cocktail is good and I suggest you try them all. The Bloody Mary has a delicious season salt rim and it is only like $4 on happy hour. Also, get the fries with the avocado crema ($3). You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I could not have asked for a better lunch spot than here. With a 6 hour happy hour and delicious food, I have absolutely zero complaints. Not to mention they are very friendly here and they treat customers extremely well. I would recommend this place 100%!!!"}
{"text":"Great fish tacos and really cool atmosphere. Friendly and knowledgeable service. The spicy dip for the French fries is awesome too!"}
{"text":"THE best happy hour in town and the RoRoBurger is the best hamburger around. Paloma's are outstanding!  Love this place."}
{"text":"First off I loved the fish tacos! I had a great grapefruit and vodka drink and you could tell the juice was super fresh. However I did find the set up of the whole restaurant kind of strange and I was never really sure who our server was. The menu is also a tad small for my taste but what we had was very good"}
{"text":"This place is cute.  It's very unassuming.  The food menu is small, which I appreciate.  The drink menu is longer.  I only had ice tea. 

I got the Roro burger.  Was in an English muffin.  I actually really liked it.  A hint of spice and tang! The French fries were super good, they were seasoned with something I can't place, but as a whole, the meal was great.

The churro ice cream sammich - yas gawd!  Was a great ending to my lunch.

The staff is super nice, but disappeared a lot. And it wasn't one person who took our order, or gave us our check, or took our money. That was the only bummer I experienced."}
{"text":"Had a great time here. The atmosphere is very enjoyable and the food is even better. They have great fries with an amazing dipping sauce. Great place to go for a relaxed fun filled experience"}
{"text":"Picked this oasis randomly because it was easy to get to off the 10 and it made me want to move to Phoenix!  We had cocktails and the yakitori (tender and nice sauce), ceviche tostada (bright and citrusy) and fish tacos and the churro ice cream sandwich and not only was it some of the best food I've eaten but it was affordable.  I would go back in a heartbeat.  Wish it was closer!"}
{"text":"Great food with a really awesome atmosphere! Centrally located to the art district in Phoenix. Love the coffee shop and art museum tied to it as well."}
{"text":"I love this place! The shrimp and chips is so good! They have amazing drinks and they're 1/2 off from 11 am - 6 pm. I've tried the C & V Paloma, the Mexi-Cold Brew, Rosemary & the Sage as well as the Peanut Butter Porter and they're all delicious and refreshing. The place is pretty small but I love how cozy and intimate it feels. Great customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place on yelp while in the area since I was STARVING. It did not disappoint! I had the all day burrito and my mom had the RoRo burger which was made on an English muffin. We split them so we could try each. Both were amazing and I would order again. We had some French fries so I asked for dipping sauce and they had three house made sauces they make there. This is what really sold me on the place. They got great sauce. My personal fav for French fries was the malted aioli, but there was an avocado creme was also amazing on the burrito! The third sauce was a Russian something or other and it was also a tasty option. The guys who run the place are all super cool, I'm glad they decided to open this place. The atmosphere is super modern and big city feel. Very into it, will return!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend during happy hour. Only outdoor seating was available which was no problem since the weather was pleasant. We had originally come for half off drinks and a bite to eat, but neither of us was really into the food items offered so we just got Rosemary & the Sage to sip on for a bit. It was a decent drink, pretty strong and flavorful. And for half off during happy hour, a very good deal. Just wish they had a better food menu."}
{"text":"I've only been to the bar here but I like the concept because it is connected to a gallery, has some outdoor seating, and seemed like a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great little place to drop in and grab a quick bite and a cocktail. The happy hour is awesome. The staff quite friendly. And the food is delicious. The Dressing Room has a nice little cocktail list with some well made drinks that are a great deal during happy hour. The all day burrito was a very well made combination of flavours that really works well all day.

I look forward to dining there again!"}
{"text":"The Dressing Room is a place to stop if you are downtown.  1st there is 1/2 happy hour 11-6 everyday!  They have great hand crafted drinks! The eats menu is not huge, but I have always said I would rather a restaurant do a few things great than lots of things mediocre.  I debated about a few things but picked the RoRo burger.  It and the fries were awesome!  It came on an English muffin which was perfect!  It was dense enough to keep the burger together and added to the flavor make up of the burger. They have a daily special everyday, today was Korean fried rice with shrimp, that my friend got and it she said it also was really good!  There is not a ton of indoor seating but there is also patio seating which would be great in the winter time. Ahhhhh almost forgot...the staff was great and really prompt.  We were a little early for lunch and they came and got us from the coffee area when they were ready to serve lunch.  The food and drinks were both served prompt and he staff was super pleasant. I would totally make a point to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Moving from Los Angeles to Phoenix as a young professional, I wasn't expecting to find a food spot in downtown that is right up there with any of the LA-based pubs/dinner spots. Living in the area, I have tried all the spots but Dressing Room keeps me coming back. I eat here all the time and it is always bomb. The churro ice cream sandwich is LIFE and so are the drinks as well as the fries. Not only all of that but they basically have all day happy hour. Guys- this is the perfect date spot."}
{"text":"Had a Classic Burger on a homemade muffin. It's was quite tasty, real Angus beef with high quality vegetables. Then their salads are amazing, one with this coconut vinaigrette type. Staff is super friendly, willing to cater any need, will recommend and be back!"}
{"text":"We had an event at this venue last Sunday 10/8 \"Sunday Bloody Funday\". It was partnered with United Blood services, Phoenix Rescue Mission & The Tampon Project . We donated blood, made first Aide kits for the homeless, donated feminine hygiene products for the homeless, wrote Congress on concerns & had a guest speaker Deedra Aaboud talk to us about being a woman in Congress. The event was put on by Babe Council and was from 11-3. The venue spot was perfect for us. It was clean & spacious. The staff was very friendly & the food was delish! We even had our Veuve Rose served. The UBS blood bus was able to pull up right out back for everyone to donate. We are Boss Babes doing Boss Things.....for others! #BabeCouncil2017"}
{"text":"The service was superb from the moment we walked in to the moment we left. I had no idea walking in how little the place was or that it is connected to the Monarch which I thought was actually very cool and different. Although there wasn't a lot of indoor seating there seemed to be more outside (if only it wasn't so hot this time of year!). Myself and a friend sat at the bar top and enjoyed watching three men cook right in front of us in the tiny kitchen. I tried the 2 fish tacos and the ceviche salad. Both were very good. I really liked how unique and fresh the salad was. The tacos were good and simple, but could have used some more seasoning or flavor."}
{"text":"Went into the dressing room for lunch today and had a great experience!

I had the RoRo burger which was delicious!  My lunch partner had the fish tacos which were equally delicious.

Our server Max was awesome and super friendly. The managing director Brian came over and introduced himself and talked to us for quite some time. Interesting guy and very Charming with a great story about the group's concept. The restaurant itself is in an old Warehouse with a funky art gallery and coffee shop and some other miscellaneous shops. Great concept and very interesting. Definitely lots to look at. I highly recommend this if you're downtown."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Hip little restaurant in a unique building that houses a coffee shop, art gallery and florist. About 5 tables and bar indoors and 10 tables outside on the patio. This place exudes a hip vibe with its exposed brick walls and rafters on the ceiling. The patio is also pretty sweet.  Perfect for a date or a business lunch.

Food: The menu is a pretty short list but what's on it is done very well. Everyone raves about the RoRo burger but I thought I would review the cold soba salad. It was amazing, the soba was prepared well, and the soft boiled egg with avocado was a great addition. I added grilled shrimp.  For desert, I was offered the churro ice cream sandwich. What kind of ridiculousness is that!!!! So of course I had it. Amazing! Thanks for the diabetic coma guys!

Service: Staff was extremely friendly, made one feel welcome. Very knowledgeable on menu.

Price: Not bad at all.

Summary: A restaurant you really should check out!"}
{"text":"Very great place to eat, and not just for the food. The venue is not only used for a restaurant that serves great food but it is also a cool art studio. You can kill time admiring the aberrant yet beautiful art worked that is displayed in many areas through out the venue. They are open late which is also a plus. I got the roro burger and it could possibly be the best burger I've ever tasted. The fries were pretty great as well. The food is very reasonably priced. The service was great, the staff was personable without being personal. One thing that stood out to me was they all cared about performing the functions of their jobs with a high quality. The staff was very obsequious, which is what you expect when you go anywhere but you very rarely receive. I loved this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious burger and delectable craft cocktails at half off during lunch. Great staff and comfy courtyard, best eats in Phoenix over my first week here!"}
{"text":"It was our first time in this part of Phoenix. We were just passing by and didn't even have a chance to check on Yelp for any references about this place. So, our opinion was not affected by any one or anything. Place has very urban dwelling industrial vibe. We were seated in the backyard. There is a kitchen in the back which is made out of shipping container. But do not take me wrong: there is nothing tasteless about this place. As the matter of fact every single detail and corner was thought through. Even bathroom has absolutely groovy details and fixtures. 
Service: friendly, accommodating and very fast.   There were customers that were obviously return customers. They would order food right away without even looking at the menu.
So, we didn't know what we are getting ourself into and took a leap of faith. My hubby ordered RoRo burger, my daughter ordered shrimp and chips, I ordered TJ Tacos and Cold Soba Salad. 
All portions were great size. Just a salad for me would be plenty, we splinted. TJ Tacos between all of us because I just couldn't eat everything myself :)
Everything was very very very fresh and flavorful. We are definitely coming back! See my photos. You will not be able to resist it. Great find on our part! Great lunch. See my other review for the coffee shop next door to this place. Also worth your time and attention."}
{"text":"A unique and easy going place. Very nice and energetic staff, and light decor. The menu is small ( not a bad thing..), i enjoy a place that perfects the food they make rather than a menu of 30 things and its all.. just ok. With that being said..had the burger and fries. Burger was fantastic and light and has a unique twist to the bread which i loved.. It was really good. Friend had a salad which she loved ( hey Jill) ..  Giving it four stars simply because id love just a few more options. If they can add another salad option, a light fish dish with a unique side.. and maybe a healthy trio appetizer for those who want to sit and chat over drinks... Ijs ! ..ill be back :)"}
{"text":"I've been driving by this spot a few times and finally got a chance to check it out. When we first walked in we were immediately greeted by the friendly staff. The atmosphere and ambient has a very modern/hipster feel (which I love). The menus is simple yet you have a variety of foods that will cater to just about anyone.  Our waiter described the menu as a \"scale above street truck food\" which to an extent, I agreed...  However, in my personal opinion I felt that the food was so much more. The food was fresh, well seasoned, and just tasty. We had the ceviche tostadas, burger, fish tacos, and finished off with the churro ice cream sandwich. I highly recommend this gem of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, location, friendly staff. My husband ordered the shrimp and chips I got the fish tacos, which were both unfortunately undercooked.  The cocktails were really good, we got the old fashioned and the rosemary and sage. Also, reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Met a friend here the other evening for happy hour, having never been here before.   I parked, saw a couple of gentlemen in the back courtyard and asked where The Dressing Room was.   I was told it was right there, and he was kind enough to escort me into the restaurant, which actually was from the back and into and through the kitchen.   I asked his name; Brian he stated, whom I later found out is a long-time friend of the owner, Troy, and is the general manager.   We entered into a conversation I found most enjoyable.   I guess I didn't have to tell him it was my first time there considering I didn't even know where I was.   He told me a bit about the history and the venue, which is actually called the monOrchid, and I thought it was most interesting as to how it all came to be.

I went inside the monOrchid and waited for my friend.   I had the feeling I had been there before, but just couldn't put my finger on why and when.   Then it dawned on me I had been there for Hakeem Khaaliq & Queen Muhammad Ali's showing of some of their photographic work last winter.    The walls are movable, and the venue can be set up as one large room or a number of smaller rooms.

They have special pricing on their drinks (half off) during happy hour but no special pricing on food.   No matter.   The food is so reasonably priced, it would be considered happy hour pricing anywhere else and even less so.

I decided to try the all day burrito with its scrambled eggs, American Cheese, Tenderbelly Bacon, Crispy Hash Browns, Avocado, Roasted Corn, Pico De Gallo, inside a Flour Tortilla.   I am glad to report there was not an over-abundance of potatoes.   Nothing worse!   The flavors were the right mix as well as the ingredients.   I love bacon and I love avocado.  The pico de gallo was on the side, which I asked for something a bit spicier to add.   AHHHH!  Heaven!  Perfect flavors.  

Our server suggested we try the cerviche tostado appetizer, and my friend had the  Korean yakatori.  I liked my burrito the best.  I thought the yakatori was a bit salad like.   I couldn't wrap my head around it.   I thought yakatori was skewers.  

Their parking lot is next to the small park on 2 St., or one can park along the edge of the street.  Troy is the owner and really friendly.   He came over and gave us more of a history of the building, and told us there are, in fact, offices on the second floor.

Amberly was our server.   Michele was in training.   Both were very informative, patient, professional, and friendly.   

I would definitely return.   There is a plant shop, but, alas, it was closed by the time we got up to leave."}
{"text":"The food is really good here! I had the Roro Burger and was awesome! It was the best burger I've had in awhile. The service was great and even though it's hot outside the mist kept us cool and the ambience was nice!"}
{"text":"Great cocktails. Ceviche sales very fresh and enjoyable. Burrito was packed with delicious ingredients."}
{"text":"This joint offers in my opinion the best salad I have ever had. The cold soba noodle salad with added shrimp is down right amazing.  I know some would look at the photo and think I am nuts.  You may think the salad looks too busy or too different, I would probably think the same but you would be sooooooo wrong. The cold soba salad is perfect in every way. I would eat the dish everyday day, no joke. The dish alone makes this restaurant five stars. I love it that much. 

Okay, on to other dishes. The TJ tacos were a little disappointing. I have been searching and continue to search for the perfect fish taco. The burrito, sorry forgot the exact name, was very good and would order again.

Lastly, the staff was great. I have been here a few times now for the best salad ever and the wait staff have always treated my family and I great. 

Overall, you can not go wrong with this restaurant and the best salad of al time :)"}
{"text":"Great cocktails, great food, great ambiance.  I wish I could have tried each cocktail as they all looked fantastic. The Spiked Chai was quite satisfying.  We heard the burgers and fries were good so that's what we went for: one Classic and one RoRo. You could smell when you walked in that they knew how to do burgers right. They were perfectly cooked as ordered (medium rare). The fries were tasty as was our side of pickles.  And the churro ice cream sandwich was worth licking the bowl (but I resisted the urge; barely).  If I could give 4.5 stars I would because the service wasn't quite perfect. Our waitress could have been a little quicker with refills and seemed tired or sore. But it did bot ruin the experience and would not prevent me from returning."}
{"text":"I LOVE meat. So don't ask me to explain why I ordered the Veggie Tacos. All I can say is YUM good. Fun place, great service. Just do it! Oh, really great drinks as well!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Sunday with a friend. Their burrito was great! What wasn't great was the service.. it was HORRIBLE. We weren't greeted for 10 minutes. We ordered drinks and food at the same time since we had a while to review the menu. We got our food in decent time but didn't get our drinks until we were almost finished with our food. While there, another table of 5 women got up and left before their drinks came Because the service was so slow. It's a cute atmosphere but I will NOT be visiting there again."}
{"text":"I find it hard to believe that I am the duchess at The Dressing Room as I have been there a total of 4 times. I would think there would be so many regulars coming back. Regardless of that, The Dressing Room has quickly become one of my top 5 favorite places to eat. Wether it's brunch (great patio) or dinner, this place is amazing. There has not been one thing that I have ordered that has been less than amazing. Roro Burger, Veggie tacos, Shrimp & chips, TJ tacos and ceviche. I love that the menu is small and limited because they really focus on the quality of the food and drinks. The staff is so gracious and friendly, everyone always has a smile on their face. My boyfriend and I are big fans. Great job Dressing Room. You are what local foodies dreams are made of."}
{"text":"Delicious food at a great price. Small cozy space. Enjoyed the atmosphere, dress up or down, it all goes here. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Cute back patio and great food sometimes u have to love the limited menu. Then u know they do those items right."}
{"text":"Welcoming customer service, delicious food and drinks. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"So me and a friend went here for drinks and a bite. Ordered the snack fries with all three sauces ... she says\" get the spicy Russian \" but the aioli is delicious. The bourbon drink had a punch and the c&v paloma was so tasty I ordered threee.."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The All Day Burrito is mouth watering!! A++++ customer service!!!"}
{"text":"The Dressing Room is a really good, chill spot for some tacos and drinks. The vibe is a little eclectic and fun. They also have a nice outdoor patio in the back of the restaurant. 

I ordered the fish tacos, fries and a Bloody Mary. The fish tacos were pretty good, not the best I've ever had but the fries were delicious. They bring out three types of sauces for the fries and they were all delicious. The Bloody Mary was also pretty good, a little watered down but still good.

The service was really good, and we were there during happy hour so all of our drinks were discounted. 2 meals, and multiple drinks for $35...not too shabby"}
{"text":"We had our company Holiday lunch here and the food was great! Diverse mix of comfort food with a twist!"}
{"text":"I would like to give this place another star, but after going there a number of times I'm kind of bored with their menu. For what is there, it's decent, but I think I'm going to take a break from going here for a while. I do enjoy the cocktails. I just wish the food would step up a little bit. There are lots of great places to eat downtown I wish that the dressing room would switch up their menu a little bit."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my son at this great, new downtown spot! Kevin took great care of us at the bar--service was bend over backwards accommodating. The ceviche appetizer was super fresh and delicious. Their cold soba noodle salad was looked amazing and colorful, and I enjoyed the tenderness of the Korean beef skewers, perfectly cooked, along with the crispy, fresh slaw. The fact that they do happy hour from 11-6 ain't bad, either! All in all, a wonderful addition to downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Lovely little hidden gem in downtown Phoenix. I had the ramen noodle salad and it was to die for! It was fresh and filled with healthy ingredients, lightly dressed, and just the right portion size. The people I was there with had their tacos and said they were really good as well. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This is a little gem. Their cocktail drink Paloma has a neat and unique combination of just the right ingredients. Their fish tacos are to die for as well. The place has a unique style to it. The manager was very friendly and kept checking in on us. (Manager if you are reading this, the online dating story I shared with you about your employee was Ryan, Ryan was the guy)"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! We came around 5:20 on a Friday night and lucked out with a spot on the patio. We enjoyed some delicious half price cocktails (this places happy hour rocks) and got the shrimp and chips which were AMAZING! We ended with the churro ice cream sandwich which again was AMAZING! I will most definitely be back to this small and hip restaurant. Thank you for the excellent service, food, and experience!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out yesterday while driving through Phoenix, we definitely were not disappointed! I was going to go with their Original burger but after reading some of the other reviews I decided to try the Roro burger and I am so glad I did. At first my group and I were worried the burger was going to be tiny after seeing they used an English muffin as the bread, but it was a good sized burger that came out. The purple onions they put in the burger gives it a bit of a sweet flavor but it's not overly sweet and goes really well with the burger. The burger comes with fries that are seasoned with something that reminded us of Taj√≠n, which honestly I could have done without because it made the fries saltier than what I usually like but they were a nice level of crispiness so they were still pretty good. Our waitress was friendly and the place is really nice and clean, if this place was closer to home I would love to go back!"}
{"text":"This is a hit or miss place. Service is down the middle and sometimes can have slow service. Staff is usually really friendly and atmosphere is relaxing and refreshing. 

Disappointed in my last visit. Got drinks and food during happy hour and we got our food pretty quick, however our drinks took 30 minutes. I got a passive aggressive speech from the general manager of why it took so long and was not too impressed with drinks. Really strong."}
{"text":"My new spot. My girlfriend and I will be back to try everything on the menu.....twice."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service.  And I mean that.  I walked in and I had three people immediately welcome me. I sat at the bar and had great conversation with one of the chefs and with cool peeps at the bar. Drinks and food came fast!  The food was great- I had the Yakatori.  Delicious! Eat them like Asian lettuce wraps...Only if you can because they're huge. All in all a great addition to the neighborhood.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Had the veggie tacos and a fantastic cup of chai. Totally delish."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and early happy hour from reading reviews on Yelp. We couldn't have been happier with our choice. Cocktail menu was diverse and delightful and the food was over the top delicious! We sat on the back patio and enjoyed a beautiful Phoenix afternoon."}
{"text":"Came here because it was highly recommended.  I had the noodle salad which was amazing and the ceviche.  The food was great, the service was awesome, they are all very friendly and would come back again!"}
{"text":"Service good but food pretty  greasy..  ordered Diet Coke but got coke  light.  Nice ambience.  2.5 more appropriate rating,"}
{"text":"I specifically came here to try their churro ice cream sandwich after reading a Phoenix New Times post that raves about them. Unfortunately I didn't hold the same feelings they did. The churro was missing cinnamon, and was so thin that it became crispy all the way through, instead of having that doughey middle that churros are meant to have. And the vanilla ice cream needed more vanilla. It tasted like only cream. I'll come back here to try their food because some of it sounds interesting."}
{"text":"This location is beyond cool and the food and service is better! I will definitely be back soon. Thanks team!"}
{"text":"We had an unplanned stopover in Phoenix and stumbled across this absolute gem. Great food (RoRo burger and fish tacos) and friendly, relaxed but quick service. The seasonal draft (cherry) was delicious and the effort was made to explain the finer details. The servers were all great with suggestions and we had a look around the art gallery next door. Certainly a night and meal to remember."}
{"text":"This place is very good! The french fries are to die for!! I wanted to lick the salt off the basket - that is how good it was. I want to go back tomorrow!
The chica morada was refreshing and delicious for a warm day in Phoenix."}
{"text":"One of the best spots in Phoenix. Everything I've had here is excellent and the cocktails are perfectly crafted. The outdoor seating is very intimate and feels very upscale.  My favorites here are the RoRo Burger and the all day breakfast burrito. The garlic aioli here is super addictive- this place is permanently in my rotation of go to restaurants in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My husband's burger and fries were great, but I was a little let down by the veggie tacos. The veggie taco mainly consisted of sweet potatoes that were undercooked, corn, and a huge piece of fried cheese. Had I known about the cheese, I probably would've ordered the fried fish taco instead. Someone next to us ordered it and it looked really good."}
{"text":"I was here for dinner once and their food it's yummy even tho they have a very small menu! We order 3 items and they were all god! We had the Peruvian ceviche, fried Oaxaca cheese tacos and the fish tacos all great and their cocktails are good also! They have happy hour everyday from open to 6 pm i believe! I am ready to come back to the dressing room!"}
{"text":"We were driving across country and were looking for a halfway point for a delicious meal.  We found it!  While reading the reviews, I kept reading about the RoRo burger.  This isn't something I would typically eat but I couldn't resist.   It was the bomb, I mean, my bestie had to smoke a cigarette afterwards, it was that good.  The drinks were crafty and delicious.  Oh, and the staff? Awesome.  Needless to say, they get 5 five stars, and are definitely recommended."}
{"text":"All day burrito and the fish tacos were phenomenal. Hand made cocktails were great as well. For a smaller menu, they do everything well"}
{"text":"It wasn't until I ate here that I realized Churros and Ice Cream are MEANT FOR EACH OTHER. If you enjoy happiness, please please try this churro ice cream sandwich."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! Evan and Joseph don't know what common sense is therefore should be disregarded. Joseph, for someone who writes reviews, you would think you'd have the common sense to look up the place you're going to before you go there. That's the point of yelp, so you're complaints about the menu are obnoxious because HAD YOU LOOKED IT UP LIKE EVERYONE ELSE, you would of been able to see their menu. Don't leave bad reviews based on your own diet preferences that could have easily been avoided. Clearly you don't know how yelp or the internet works. As for the veggie tacos, which I ordered (heyy vegetarians!) they're delicious. It's not a blob of cheese. They come topped with the avocado crema, pico de Gallo, Peruvian corn, and YES, those are sweet potatoes. Also clearly stated on the menu. All of the flavors paired really nicely, and the cheese wasn't cold AT ALL. The fries get a lot of hype here and I can see why, they were perfect. The avocado crema (that Evan whined about not standing out) I thought was great. How high were your expectations for avocado... and sour cream? Our waiter answered all of our questions, which we didn't have many of considering the menu isn't very big and if you can read it's pretty self explanatory.. he gave great drink recommendations and sat at the table next to us to take our order rather than stand above us. Appreciated, great demeanor. The waitress who seated us was very friendly as well and even answered questions for some visitors walking down the back alley who after that came in to eat. The music in the background was really fun as well, I definitely recommend stopping by if you're visiting the area or if you're just looking for a place to pop In for lunch. They've got one of the best happy hours I've seen, EVERYDAY 11-6 and the entire staff smiles and greets you."}
{"text":"This is the second visit here and it was just as good as the first.  I got the Roro burger.  It was cooked perfectly....so juicy.  The pork belly and Russian dressing was a great mix of savory and acidic.  I was skeptical about the English muffin for a bun, but it really worked well.  The fries were cooked to a nice crispness, but were a bit over seasoned.  Overall I would recommend a stop at this friendly little diner."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. The food is amazing and it's a go to date night spot. I've only tried the burger and ceviche and both were delicious. The food is filling and worth the price."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Small but not cramped, they have a patio. Industrial refurbished interior, and the food and service was superb. Had the Roro Burger, and I will be back, dragging all my family and friends w me."}
{"text":"Food very good, atmosphere modern and relaxing. They have specialty drinks both alcohol and non. Excellent dog friendly patio both in front and back."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I are here on an off night.  The drink menu is fantastic, the food very good, but the atmosphere and vibe is what truly sets it apart.  Lastly, sit on the patio and you can thank me later."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. The service was great and the food was amazing. Will definitely be making this our new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"New spot I found and spent half my Saturday there. I came to BE for breakfast meeting but sat outside on the dressing room side. Perfect weather day to do so and the atmosphere was so chill and quaint. Jacob and the other owner was so awesome to my friend and I. The waitress and waiter were so friendly and quick. I had the classic burger with fries and aioli so delish! Love, love this place and will be hanging out more here. The owners are doing a great job!"}
{"text":"Popped in for lunch on a Friday. Patio was full, but March in Phoenix it was expected. Had the Veggie Tacos, which were amazing, and a side of fries with the Spicy Russian and Malt Aioli sauces, the Spicy Russian was their take on a thousand island based sauce, and was very good. Washed it down with a Uinta Hop Nosh, which they had on tap, and happy hour half-off pricing. Tacos and fries were great, staff was super attentive, and the food was great. 

Only complaint from me was that it's a little tough to find parking right now, but I imagine that the construction next door has a lot to do with that."}
{"text":"Awesome drinks and food. We tried the burger and the fish tacos. Both were amazing. It's a little cramped, but the food makes it worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour! Great drink and food specials, menu is small but fun options. Loved the environment and service was good. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great! Just great. 

I had the burger and it was good and the fries were okay (they had some odd lemon seasoning that wasn't bad but I'd prefered just salt). I can't wait to go back and try the shrimp (I'll be updating).

They clearly have hired professionals and service was excellent. 

Here's the real killer. The place. I ate on the patio under a sizable tree with a KICKASS speaker hanging in it. The sound was spectacular and the music exceptional (playing the likes of The Smiths, Washed Out and a slew of chillaxing hip hop that's probably hipper than I). For me, music makes everything better and they are nailing it this department. AND the patio is situated in the back, it's ALMOST hidden making it feel like a little sanctuary. It's typically something you see in New Orleans or in the cool little indie neighborhoods in other towns. This is RoRo's first and boy is it welcome.

Big ups!"}
{"text":"Came here to grab some burgers and were very pleasantly surprised with how nice and modern this place is. Frys and burgers are tits. Great house music and the customer service was outstanding. Come with a date or the older kids."}
{"text":"After seeing The Dressing Room featured on a downtown Phoenix Instagram feature, we decided to check it out. It was not disappointing!

The menu is kinda like upscale Mexican street food. To start, we had fries with avocado crema which was amazing! The fries are seasoned with a citrus salt, which really compliments the avocado crema.

For dinner, I had the ceviche salad. I would highly recommend it. The ingredients were fresh and delicious; it was a unique take on ceviche. 

The prices were also reasonable, especially given the location. They do have a happy hour menu, we just didn't make it in time."}
{"text":"A cool and intimate spot that makes very tasty gourmet street food! The space is modern and minimal which reminds me a lot of the eateries I like at home. I always order the breakfast burrito with oxaca cheese and sweet potatoes."}
{"text":"Just tried this place the other night with the family and it definitely did not live up to the reviews. The place looks so cool and hip with a great patio area but the menu is VERY limited. The beef yakatori was very fatty and we had 3 different servings of it between us so it was just one bad order. the seasoned fires and different dipping sauces were good. The all day egg burrito was very average. No plans to return here. Such a let down as the outside, inside and patio area was so nice."}
{"text":"When I walked in, everyone greeted me like a member of the family! The inside is small, but chic. However, the outdoor seating area provides a perfect experience. I had the shrimp and chips, which were tasty. The lemony French fries with malt aioli could become addictive!"}
{"text":"Those of you who follow my reviews know that I do not like paying for atmosphere when I'm buying food, but I'm going to make an exception this time - this is place is cool.  It's like eating in an art gallery (in fact, it IS eating in an art gallery). It is interesting and fun. Our visit came at the end of a long day and we were very quickly comfortable and relaxed.

The menu is limited but everything we had was healthy and yummy.  My burger was served on fresh bread. My salad was fresh. They have a small but good selection of beers on tap. To be honest, none of the food was particularly memorable, but it was healthy and filling. The (salt and vinegar?) fries were a bit too sour, but everything else at our table was fine. Cost was reasonable - they could mark it up more to reflect the atmosphere, but they don't, which is admirable.

I'm only giving them four stars though because they are trying just a bit too hard to be trendy - Portland style. I really don't need to hear the whole story of where every component of my meal came from. Just tell me what's good and I'll give it a try."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, this place is amazing. Feels really casual and improvised. The food is super fresh. I meant to take a photo of my amazing soba noodle salad, but I started eating it so quickly and enjoying it so much that I missed my shot. The menu is super eclectic. Inspired by food truck dining, apparently. A burger. Some skewers. The taco. But you can tell these guys really do their heart into taking it to the next level. The dining area and I and R and patio are really well designed and young and cool. I am definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Second time here and with Dan and Alberto are always hooking it up!  Love the drinks and who can't dig an all day happy hour....especially the signature Hard Stuff.  Rojo burger the first time and Peruvian Ceviche today with fries.  OMG this place rocks! Think Restoration Hardware meets a Chicago swanky bar vibe!"}
{"text":"Lovely micro restaurant! The kitchen staff is welcoming and the wait staff is very kind. My favorite drink is the seasonal aqua frescas and the churro ice-cream sandwich is my favorite dessert in all of phoenix"}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour and even more amazing drinks!!!  great place to chill back and relax with some friends on a beautiful sunny Phoenix day!"}
{"text":"I yelped to find a spot that had high ratings for food cause I was hangry. Lo and behold! I find my new favorite place! 
This is art gallery meets skate park meets high class. I love the ambience. Since I  just dropped in dressed in work clothing I don't feel up to posing for neat shots. You can guarantee I will be getting dressed to come back.
Now, and this is the sad part!!! The food is outta this world with a simple menu but high quality so it's not hard to choose quickly & you can't go wrong!!! There's something for meat eaters & vegetarians in case you happen to be travelling in mixed company.
Atmosphere is the bomb-diggity, Music is off the charts & Brendan...customer service is on 10. I truly felt as if I was among familiar people.
This was my first time but it won't be my last. If you haven't been - we've got to fix that problem."}
{"text":"This place is near my office, to say it is good is an understatement! I have had lunch there many times and ordered to go alot.  I have never been disappointed.  The shrimp and chips perfect.  Burger GREAT! Staff is great, Victor the cook is excellent, if he is cooking your meal will be great."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great first impression the Dressing Room made on our entire group. The inside is small and there were no free tables so we sat on the patio. They kept the patio cool with coolers and spritzers so we didn't feel like it was 110 degrees. Our waitress was friendly and offered great suggestions on dishes to try. Our friend ordered the All Day Burrito and absolutely loved it, licked his fingers and was ready to order a second one loved it so much! My husband ordered the RoRo burger with fries and tried one of the fancy dipping sauces. I had the shrimp and chips and found it to be the perfect portion and the shrimps were plump and flavorful. Our other friend ordered the ceviche salad and enjoyed the creative interpretation. Our waitress got busy but received some amazing support from one of the restaurant directors who made our day! the cocktails were creative and delicious. Happy hour prices are amazing. Why are you not here already??"}
{"text":"More hits then misses. 
 Service- great. Andrew was very attentive and recommended a side with my meal and it worked out perfectly 
 Ambiance- relaxed and mellow. I sat outside to enjoy the Arizona warmth and was sat under the tree for shade and the misters around the back patio definitely helped and felt comfortable 
Drink- I tried the Rosemary and the Sage. Loved it. Definitely a must have 
Food- tried they Peruvian Ceviche and it was decent. A good portion. I just wish they would have either added some of the lemon juice the fish is cooked in either on the dish or on the side. The dish itself was very flavorful but I felt it was dry. I also had a side of French fried with the avocado may dip. Very flavorful 
All in all definitely check out this place. I would come back next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Still GREAT!best fries in town. They make their own potato chips too. Servers managers cooks everyone amazing. A lot of locals and people from word of mouth. Part gallery coffee shop resteraunt what more can u ask. Give it a shot (If u haven't already) its,well worth it."}
{"text":"Wow- SO good!! Ceviche salad with tostada to scoop it up.  Manager was super personable and passionate about the place.  Wonderful!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here before going to the McDowell mtn music festival for a quick bite.  had the cold soba salad with shrimp added.  nice, light, and fresh. freaking fantastic!  I'll be back probably with the hubby and kid."}
{"text":"I was hoping this place would be cool since i live directly behind it, but it's not. Fish tacos were good, drinks were alright, but there were so many flys! Literally, buzzing around us the whole time. Also, my waiter was slightly rude. I could tell she assumed what kind of person I was, and didn't expect a tip from me, so the service followed suit. It was the tallest female sever they have, you can't miss her. Never judge a book by its cover lady, that was really rude and i felt unwanted(you know exactly what i'm talking about).  I'll never be back and i'll be spreading the word to all my neighbors and friends."}
{"text":"Great food and drink! I wish the building was a little larger and the waiters are slow to return and ask for your order."}
{"text":"Fantastic drinks and tacos. Great little patio, right next door to Monorchid Gallery. Wonderful new gem downtown."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner on a Saturday night and were happy to be able to be seated right away.  My husband enjoyed his cocktail and I enjoyed my non-alcoholic house made beverage.  We tried the fries, which are quite tasty.  My husband ordered a burger (which he said tasted very good) and I had the veggie tacos.  While my tacos weren't spicy (that's my husband's preference), I enjoyed the creativity and the flavor.  I would definitely come here again for those.  There was a little mix up with our order, but it was recognized immediately and the staff went out of their way to remedy things.  We were quite happy with our experience here.  It would be great if they had more convenient parking, however."}
{"text":"Beautiful food and drinks in a hip little space. We had the fish tacos and the Yakitori skewers and, although arent normally the kind to take pictures of food, we felt the beauty had to be captured before we devoured it. Everything tasted fresh and light and we would definitely return if we ever find ourselves in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"I came in today while in Phoenix on business. It was across the street from where I was staying. It's a little place that doesn't look like much from the street but don't let that stop you. It's got a great feel and the staff is great. The All Day Burrito was one of the best things I've tasted and the salsa that came with it is a must. Something else I appreciated was that upon returning after paying my tab the gentleman addressed me by name and thanked me for coming in. I don't know why more waitstaff and restaurants don't do this. It's a little thing that makes a big difference, and I appreciated it."}
{"text":"Had the RoRo Burger.  Damn it was just what I wanted.  Tangy, Spicy, now I want another on.  Friendly staff, prompt service.  Fun creative environment."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix on vacation and found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try after a long day hike.  I am so happy I found this little gem.  The fries with avocado cream were amazing!  The cold soba salad with grilled shrimp was fresh and healthy. Service was above and beyond my expectations and the decor is hip and fun.  Can't forget about happy hour drinks from 11-6- I had the C&V Paloma and it was so delicious, very well balanced. I can't wait to go back to this great spot on Rosevelt Row."}
{"text":"All I can say is \"Wow!\" My fianc√© and I came here for an early dinner/happy hour during our short trip to Phoenix. We sat on the patio, which had a nice ambiance. Drinks were amazing (half price before 6:00). For food we shared an order of fries with a spicy Russian sauce and an order of the veggie tacos. I tend to be somewhat of a French fry snob, and these truly did NOT disappoint. The tacos had great flavor, and were filling enough, but not so much that we couldn't save room for dessert -- the churro ice cream sandwich! An ice cream sandwich made with churros and vanilla bean gelato! So delicious! Definitely a must-stop if you're in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Good food and service (somewhat). I wasn't impressed with the drinks or the owner, per se. I think every bar should always be accommodating--even if their menu is short. I wouldn't recommend this place for drinks. They can step it up significantly. The food did look delicious and the bartender was very polite."}
{"text":"The best happy hour and prawns with fries I've ever had!! I've been here a ton and love the staff and service. Definitely try out some of there drinks."}
{"text":"Happiness - 3/5
Deliciousness - 2/5

I came here after a movie and the menu looked great. But the food just didn't deliver. The burger and fries were fine, but unremarkable. I ordered multiple dipping sauces for my fries, but none of them stood out and I didn't finish them.  My brother really liked the peanut sauce on his Yakitori steak and generally enjoyed the restaurant more than I did.

The waiter was unable to answer any of our questions about the menu. The manager came by and we had a nice conversation and he seemed really enthusiastic about the restaurant."}
{"text":"Alright so this place is pretty small so expect a wait most times.  They have Happy Hour EVERY DAY from 11 AM - 6 PM with half off of beer, wine and cocktails (they do 9oz wine pours). The patio is gorgeous and they have a bunch of speakers hanging from the large tree in the center. They are always bumping good music. 

My only complaint is the patio backs the alley and the dumpster so you get some pretty nasty smells wafting over. The smell is worth it for the RoRo burger, it seriously kicks delicious ass. It's on an english muffin with a thick slice of bacon... Yum. The servers are all super nice and friendly here as well."}
{"text":"Amazing. We got the Korean skewers (pro-tip: add an extra skewer for only $3) and fries with avo crema. Then the drinks: the happy hour is amazing. Half off everything?!? We got: the rosemary and sage, the peppered elderflower, and the Paloma, plus a beer and a new bourbon. Great price, wonderful service, quaint dog friendly patio. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Passing through town for work and stumbled on this gem. Coffee shop, coworking space, art gallery,  plant space, and restaurant all in one. Service is exceptional. Dry pepper lime seasoning on french fries is bomb."}
{"text":"We were really excited to try the Dressing Room. The menu is very limited so check it out before you go there. I had the RoRo Burger which was good but also very greasy and well done. French fries that come with it are good but typical fries, nothing to write home about. The space is really unique it is connected to other shops. We sat inside but the back patio looked very cute."}
{"text":"bingo bongo this place is the best in DTPHX.

vibes are off the charts. you walk in and see Boba Fett. is that not enough for you to already agree with me?

Okay, you asked for it. All these other things happened during my time there:

Dre Day by Dr Dre featuring Snoop Dogg played while I was drinking a delicious Peanut Butter Porter. What beauty. What grace. What serenity 

Yakatori with Peanut Sauce massaged me into an enchanted stupor of warmth and love, while a plate of bright, uplifting Ceviche took its white fish and Peruvian corn and carried me to the Great Valley of Shrimp and Chips, where I was bathed it the velvety Vinegar Aioli and absolved of all my sins. 

Get those three appetizers (Yakatori, Ceviche, and Shrimp). The Shrimp and Chips especially. Such muscular Shrimps were delivered to us. Think the Rock in Shrimp form. Delicious. 

Fo sho yo tho, the RoRo is so whoa whoa. What a decadent and rich experience. Eating it felt being in an episode of MTV Cribs.

The service that was received was top notch; super attentive, super friendly. Being a person with not many friends, I am contemplating going back right now just to hang out.

Then, towards the end of the meal, love personified flew into my mouth and into my stomach, and the sheer centripetal force resulted in me combusting directly into and spreading throughout the very fabric of the universe, effectively achieving nirvana. This, my friends and countrymen, was the Churro Ice Cream. Singlehandedly, the best dessert I have ever had.

Dear God, JUST GO HERE ALREADY"}
{"text":"I went to check out bcoffee yesterday morning. It was so good I came back tonight to check out TDR. My friend and I both had the roro burger. Love the soft English muffin. The burgers and frys were excellent. Everyone that works there is so spot on with the perfect mix of helpfulness, hospitality, and attentiveness while leaving you alone just the right amount. A phx favorite for me after just one visit. Ready to go back and try the next thing!"}
{"text":"Well placed location with outstanding service, food, and drinks. Don't think about it too much, just go in and try any cocktail or dish off their small but well chosen menu. 

Ratings show that they're great, but at first I was hesitant to try The Dressing Room out because of the # of items on the menu. Another burger and taco joint...ehhhhh. 

But once I got there I understood that the menu was limited because they've perfected every dish. I mean, the French fries were so exquisitely seasoned and ever so crispy but melt-in-your-mouth-y. 

I'm originally from South Florida where there is an abundance of yummy ceviche spots. It's been a mission to find good ceviche in The Valley. But this ceviche, this ceviche right here...the best I've came across in AZ and at that it was a \"salad\".  The ceviche salad included a good portion of the fish, unlike other places where you feel as if you're swimming with your fork hoping to come across a bite of seafood. 

Happy Hour is from 11-6 and all of their amazing cocktails are half off during those hours. Attentive waiters and a serene ambience. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Pretty sure my $8 burrito contains the kraft cheese slices. And it was served on a plastic tray. You pay for the hipster vibe here for sure."}
{"text":"Seven of us ate here yesterday for lunch. We all ordered something different and it all was super delicious. Max was a fun, informative waiter. The owner checked to make sure we were all happy. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Best lunch I've had in a long, long, looong time. Only thing better than the food was the service...or was the food better? Honestly, this place blew my mind. I love it when places have focused, small menus where each item is fantastic. There is no point having a 30 options if they all blow donkey d. 10 items and each is fire. God bless y'all. We'll be back fo sho. 

If you're stupid enough to pass on the ice cream sandwich, it will haunt you."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of DTPHX, The Dressing Room is a bright addition on Roosevelt St. I work nearby and had lunch here on a weekday. We got the All Day Burrito, Cold Coba Salad, and Churro Ice Cream Sandy for dessert. The All Day Burrito was delicious & a good portion size for lunch - not too big or too small - and the salad was also yummy. My fave part though, without a doubt, was the churro ice cream dessert! The presentation was adorable but it tasted even better, especially with the warm churro and the ice cream... YUM.

For a quiet weekday, service was great. There are some seats in the small area inside and a back patio. Parking, like many places downtown, is scarce. There are metered parking on the street or this tiny lot behind the restaurant (less than 5 spots if they're not already taken). My only complaint is that I wish they had a bigger menu with more selections! Definitely wouldn't mind coming back here again to try their drinks and other items."}
{"text":"I swung by here after a flight from California on my way to Sedona, and have to say... this place's veggie tacos are the best I ever had. Flavorful, delicious, not too heavy, creative and unique. Loved the atmosphere too - hip and cool, and friendly service. I would love to come again."}
{"text":"Very good food had the fish taco and fried shrimp it was very delicious. Servers were fast and friendly and attentive. Drinks are really good we happen to stopped by their happy hours and the drinks were half off. Will return here again next time I'm here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Best Place Ever!!! Great food! Great staff! Great Vibes!!!!! And Amanda is the best !! Go see her!!!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing time! Service is fast and so kind. Food and cocktails were amazing. Zach was our server and really just made the night unforgettable. Thanks Dressing Room!"}
{"text":"My co workers wanted to do first Friday again and decided to come here to eat first since it was right on Roosevelt.. this place has a decent size patio dining area but it was so hot yesterday wanted to grab a table inside.. took about an hour to get one to fit about 6 people .. their staff were nice and kept checking up on us while we waited.. they have pretty good happy hour until 6 (they have the peanut butter porter from uncle bears brewery which I love!!) I order their fish tacos which was pretty delicious..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing... I am visiting from LA and the music, vibe and food is amazing!! Love it!!"}
{"text":"Awesome first taste of Phoenix. The story of the joint is pretty neat, and fits the eclectic artsy vibe. A nice long happy hour is a sure plus and was an unexpected treat for our lunch. I highly recommend the Paloma and the RoRo burger. Also the two sauces I tried on the unique, spicy fries were the malt aioli and the avo crema, and both were deliciously good. I'd come back, and I'd probably have the same thing!"}
{"text":"Just passing through Phoenix on our way to Sedona and wanted to grab a bite near the airport. Did a quick search and decided to give this a go. Neighborhood is funky, artsy and still a bit transitional. It's not a large place so we almost missed it. We were sat in the backyard under a large tree. Even at 2 pm there was still a steady crowd. We had the breakfast burrito, the shrimp and chips and the ah-maz-ing Churro Ice Cream Sandwich. The french fries were spectacular and seasoned with a variety of spices and just a hint of lemon juice. I would have never thought of putting lemon juice on french fries, but I loved it! But the standout was definitely the churro ice cream sandwich. Crunchy, cinnamon-y and lightly fried halves were filled with a homemade vanilla bean ice cream that gave just the right amount of sweetness. A total mess to eat, but worth every napkin. Would definitely stop back whenever in town."}
{"text":"My meal was delicious, the service was great and the general vibe of the place was awesome! The cocktail I also had was great! Would happily go again, perfect for a catch up with friends or even a date because of the close proximity and genre of the place! Loved it."}
{"text":"Service is amazing, atmosphere is cool without being pretentious, and the food is crazy good... I highly recommend the RoRo Burger. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Classic burger was as good as I've had,  fries were excellent,  and sidewalk ambience was enjoyable.  The price couldn't be better, maybe because my daughters paid ( but they said they were quite satisfied as well)."}
{"text":"So let's start off with Peruvian corn.
I'm doubtful they are buying it fresh on the cob. 
It seems like a fancy name for hominy I know isn't. And I know the chef probably pulls his hair out when guys like me call it hominy, but, Peruvian corn is kind of a deal to get... kind of.
ANYWAYS... This place is really cool. It's a hip location on or near Roosevelt Row, or whatever they are calling that Roosevelt area now. At 1st I was a little worried about it being a hipster hangout that was too cool for a dad in his 40s... but I was wrong!!! I mean it IS too cool for a dad in his 40s BUT they didn't care...
 They have a nice little menu. The place is clean and the staff is beyond friendly! God that makes a huge difference!!! Yeah, I'm talking to you LUX. What a novel concept to have your employees actually seem HAPPY to see customers! The other nice thing is they have an easy to pronounce menu! Veggie Tacos. How easy is that. Veggie Tacos. I was at a place last week and they has a dish call Colachita... Cola Chita? Co La Chita. Co Lachi ta? I wanted to try it but didn't... I'm perfectly capable of making ass out of myself. I don't help from some trendy menu. 
Moving along
The veggie tacos are really, really, really good. Like great. I'm impressed. IDK if I'm impressed with the fact that the chef makes everyone call him \"Chef\", but whatever. Some people need that. If it's just in front of guests I suppose I get it. 
So to summarize this long winded A.D.D. review, go there and check it out. Definitely and cool little place."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and found this place in Yelp. The food is amazing and the service exceeded my expectations. I totally recommend it."}
{"text":"You should probably go here. I hate telling people this because I want it to be a secret spot in Phoenix but it is so delicious. If you go here, get the burger and the fries you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with 3 other people and we all raved about our food all night. We had the veggie tacos, classic burger, roro burger and the yakatori skewers. Everything was so well seasoned, the atmosphere was hip and friendly and the drinks were strong! It is connected to an art gallery so you could walk around if you chose. 
The veggie tacos (what I had) were delicious. Fried cheese! So bomb!
10/10 would eat again."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and the staff was beyond awesome! They were all so friendly and made us feel welcomed! The Rosemary & Sage and The Donkey drinks were delicious as well as their Korean Yakatori. At the end of our meal they served us their popular churro ice cream with a birthday candle and even sang a little to my boyfriend. They were all very sweet, playful, and amazing throughout our time that night. I highly recommend coming here for their drinks, food, atmosphere, and awesome staff!!!"}
{"text":"Had the mexi cold brew. It was ok. Wouldn't get it again.
Roroburger was meh. 
Cool location and outdoor seating, friendly staff. Just food and drink wasn't anything special."}
{"text":"The burgers are amazing! Wish they had more kinds! And the churro ice cream sandwich was heavenly."}
{"text":"New favorite restaurant in Phoenix! The food is all amazing! I definitely would suggest the Coba Soba Noodle Salad or the RoRo Burger! You also can't go wrong with their fries! The fries have a really tasty seasoning and come with a few dipping sauces. Also, they have amazing cocktails! Everyday until 6 the drinks are 1/2 off!! Best deal ever! 4 dollar top-notch cocktails!!! Can't rave about this place enough! Also, everyone who works there is extremely nice!"}
{"text":"This place was great, I ordered another dinner afterwards the burger was delicious. The butter lettuce mouth watering. The ice cream love it. The drinks from the bar nice job on that too. The atmosphere is a nice Kicked back vibe, soothing music going. Nice job dressing room."}
{"text":"First off, the atmosphere here is why i love it. It's in the middle of the city on a busy street but they do manage to keep it low key. Music is a bit loud making it difficult to talk with a friend or date. However, the playlist is good.

The food is pretty good and tasty. There isn't much on the menu but i believe it does fit the place. Simplicity. I've had a couple drinks and i believe the choice could be a bit more diverse but i can't say that for sure until i come back. Also, a date of mine ordered a Bloody Mary but they did not have what was needed at the time which stuck me as odd. 

All in all, i do really enjoy the dressing room and plan on coming back in the  near future."}
{"text":"First time here and it was delicious! We loved that the burgers came on giant English muffins and the fish tacos were delicious! We sat at the bar and the service was great! They work really well in the small area that they do have! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I have to say that the dressing room was a pleasant place to be to meet up with friends and a kickback. The atmosphere and artwork was bananas in a good way, the food was delightful and the drinks were off the chain. I enjoyed every bit and moment that I had at this place."}
{"text":"If you're in downtown Phoenix exploring Roosevelt Row I highly recommend lunching at this spot! The dressing room has some delicious food options including burgers, tacos, soba noodles and more.

Atmosphere: Laid back urban chic or hipster vibe. Music is playing fairly loud. The outdoor area ends with a storage unit modified into a kitchen refrigerator area. Very unique.

Food: delicious!!! I had one Korean skewer and the soba noodle bowl. I would eat this again and I would be willing to try everything else on the menu. They know what they are doing at this place. My boyfriend ordered the fried shrimp and fries along with the homemade pickles, all of which I sampled. The aioli was not spicy but delicious, the way they fried their food tasted amazing. No complaints at all."}
{"text":"New favorite little spot in downtown phx!! The staff was so nice and the whole atmosphere was just very laid back, but upscale. Mack was our server and he was great. Zack, the manager came and chatted with us for a min as well which after working in the food industry for a while I appreciate when this happens. It's rare these days. 
THE FOOD! So delicious!! We had the TJ tacos and it's fair to say they are my favorite fish tacos I've ever had. The fries? Amazing. Shrimp and chips? A must have. Even the Korean Skewers blew me away. Seeing as that's half the menu right there, it's safe to say you can't go wrong with any of the food, or beverage, items here. I'm already looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"So much to say about this place, but this is supposed to be a review and not an article so I'll make it brief.

FULL DISCLOSURE: I've only tried the burgers and fries here. If they're any indication of the rest of the food than everything is a must-try. 

Take a moment to ask yourself, what makes a good burger joint? Have a few ideas in your head? 

Is it the quality of the meat? Quality of the fries? Whether the place has a unique twist? Good Service? Consistency?

I'm here to tell you The Dressing Room has all of that. Any burger spot can have a home run on a given night only for them to strike out on your next visit. I've been here on at least 5 separate occasions, and it has rocked me EVERY SINGLE TIME. I honestly can't tout that level of consistency about any other burger spot in Phoenix or anywhere else for that matter.

Only con I can think of is the parking situation, but that's easy to get over after you've tasted the food and experienced the fantastic level of service. 

I'm sure if I asked you for your favorite burger joint, you'd have a name in mind. If you live in Phoenix, you should be skeptical of that top spot until you've tried The Dressing Room."}
{"text":"So much more than just burgers.  Awesome street food type menu paired with unique and exciting cocktails.  Staff is incredibly attentive and friendly.  Get there!"}
{"text":"So-I'm here on a conference and we came over for happy hour.  Best drinks-best snacks and food. I would recommend the shrimp and fries. Yum."}
{"text":"Can you just move to my neighborhood? Music that's always right. Vibe and decor that amplify each other. Good food. Fine cocktailing. Unfailingly warm and friendly service. And they have a poster of lyrics up from the Black Keys along with Boba Fett. Come on! If you can't love this place you've misplaced your heart! 

Back again. Can I just take you home with me?!  You get all the major and minor bits right."}
{"text":"What a great place!  Terrific happy hour drink prices, tasty eats & outstanding service.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is absolutely amazing. I love the outside seating and the eclectic music that plays. The fries were great! I ordered they All Day Burrito. Was not a huge fan of the cheese that was used on it. Kinda seemed like a velveeta cheese. I think a shredded cheese would be better. It was also a bit salty for my taste buds. My girlfriend ordered the fish tacos and she said they were amazing. Reminded her of a fresh fish taco from San Diego ."}
{"text":"Met friends at the Dressing Room to celebrate a birthday...  Chelsea was wonderful! Very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered multiple items for sharing while enjoying beautiful cocktails. I'll definitely be back! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service. We are new to town and have came here twice because the people are so nice and the food is amazing.  Highly recommend this place if you enjoy a local hangout with amazing service and food."}
{"text":"Found the Dressing Room here on yelp awhile back and ventured right in. The seating inside consists of a counter overlooking the prep/cook area and just a few tables. A gentleman (who I quickly figured was a manager) was seated at one of the tables - he looked up from his laptop, acknowledged me and offered me the table. Nice! 

I was hungry for breakfast (at my usual 2pm) and was delighted to see an \"all-day burrito\" on the menu. My server was prompt, friendly and got my order in quickly after I was seated. However, while waiting...and waiting... it seemed \"a bit long for a burrito,\" I chuckled to myself, \"is it that it takes all day to get it, hence the name?!\" My chuckle was silenced though, when that burrito showed up and it was the mostly perfectly wrapped thing I've ever seen. Like a mid-day tenderbelly-bacon gift! Not only that, it tasted delicious - the other ingredients in it: scrambled eggs, American cheese, crispy hashbrowns, avocado, roasted corn, and pico de gallo. The fries were some of the best I've ever had as well. (Score points on that whipped avocado sour cream that is one of the choices of dip with the fries; you may also choose from malt aioli or spicy Russian.) The same manager who gave me the table popped back over to ask about my food and he commented out of the blue, \"yeah, we call it the 'all day burrito' since you can get it any time of day.\" Is he a mind-reader too!? Haha, it's as if he known that I secretly had doubted. Well, I would wait all-day for this thing anyway, so I guess it works out either way. The rest of the menu deserves further exploration at a time TBD!

I also like that The Dressing Room has a large outdoor seating area and that it shares space with the adjacent coffee shop. 

Really nice visit I had - love the urban decor, open kitchen and the excellent food and service...I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, quick service, not too expensive. Outdoor seating area with cooling mist. Neat coffee shop next door."}
{"text":"I've been to the dressing room several times to take advantage of their fabulous happy hour! They have half off all drinks... specialty cocktails included.... From 11-6 every day. That's awesome! I do wish they had some food specials, but the drink specials beat out all other happy hours in downtown. Speaking of drinks... their drinks are a little hit and miss... they tend to have very strong cocktails, but maybe not the most delicious cocktails. The space is small but super cute. The food I've tried has been great...the roro burger is insanely tasty and comes with interestingly seasoned fries (tajin I think...). It's a good sized portion for the price (around 10$). Their fried cheese tacos were also super tasty. They are full of different components that all add up to a well balanced dish. I'd highly recommend the dressing room if you're in the downtown area.


Ps- you guys need a brunch! Then you'd be perfect."}
{"text":"Amongst the hustle and bustle of downtown Phoenix, it was refreshing to find such a quiet, quaint establishment. The Dressing Room was the perfect place to sit, relax, have a drink, some delicious food and be pensive about the day that had just passed. Brian the manager could not have been more accommodating in every scenario. Churrrrrrrrrroooooooooooo ice creeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaammmmm sandwich is straight fire. Get down here as fast as you can and get the RO RO burger the shrimp and chips and a spiked chai and prepare to have the best start to any evening you've ever had. How you doing? I'm doing better cuz I just ate here."}
{"text":"Superb atmosphere! Discovered this place with some of my coworkers and what a find. The drinks were amazing, the appetizers were delicious and my fish tacos were the truth Lol! I've told several friends about this place, even my daughter so she could go with her ASU crew!  Great scenery on the patio and nice music selection. My new spot!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly service. The burger was awesome. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD & COCKTAILS. We got into Phoenix late at 9 pm and I took to yelp to find a good restaurant close to our airb&b - The Dressing Room was at the top of the yelp list and it exceeded every expectation!! The entire staff was so friendly and attentive to us. The cocktails were perfect and the food was beyond delicious. I had the veggie tacos - best veggie tacos I've ever had in my life!!! If I lived in Phoenix I would be coming here weekly!"}
{"text":"A small intimate dining room with a bar that faces the open kitchen. Genius!  I trust people more they let me see them cook. Everyone at the bar was eating shrimp and chips. Not knowing if they was a requirement or just a popular item, I joined in. An excellent choice.  The service is very friendly, a great group of guys. I'll dine here again"}
{"text":"Had lunch here after an amazing aerial yoga session at Elevate Yoga (located in the same MonOrchid building). We shared the Breakfast Burrito with bacon on the side, cold sobs noodles with shrimp, and the ceviche salad. All were light and delicious. And half off all beer, wine, and cocktails from 11-6 daily isn't too bad, either!"}
{"text":"Eclectic, great happy hour, get fish tacos, burrito, Korean wraps, soba salad, Ro Ro Burger! Good service, sit on back patio!"}
{"text":"This was the first place we ate when visiting Phoenix and it might have been the best! We showed up during happy hour so drinks were half off...and delicious. 

The cold noodle Cobb salad was fresh and flavorful (we also ordered a beef skewer) and the the veggie tacos were the BEST tacos I've ever eaten. Literally full of deep fried queso cheese, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Super hip little space connected to other restaurant. Immediately was greeted and asked if I needed help. All staff was on it and super nice. 
Hidden gem in Phoenix. I got the shrimp and chips for my trip back to LA. Yum. Fast and looks like a place I wouldn't mind having drinks at. 
If ever back in Phoenix I'll make a stop at this cute little place. 
Oh and super clean!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Small inside with a big patio. The chef is tremendous and has come up with a simple menu that does not disappoint. The burgers come on an English muffin, which sounds weird but it's actually brilliant. The muffin is nicely toasted and allows the burger to be the star of the show. You can eat a big cheeseburger here, and not feel gross and too full when you walk out. Thank the English muffin bun for that."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant! The service was on point from the moment we walked in, everyone was so friendly! The food was delicious and unique in a classic sort of way, we could not have had a better experience than we did! I will absolutely be recommending this grub hub to all my friends!! 

Thanks again for the amazing food and service!"}
{"text":"First time here. Sunday afternoon. Sat on the patio, had the fish tacos. Delicious!!! I'd come back to try more of their food."}
{"text":"Got lunch here and got the all day burrito. First thing I noticed was great portions for the price! The burrito was great. I picked off a few fries from my friends' plates too and they were fantastic too. Unfortunately, after eating half the burrito, I noticed my lips becoming slightly swollen (I have a peanut allergy), and I immediately notified the waitress. Shortly after, the chef (I assume, perhaps the manager) came out and apologized. He was so kind and accommodating. He offered to get me something else so I ordered the TJ Tacos which were also very good. Perfect portion size and fresh. At the end of it all they took care of the entire meal, which was very, VERY kind of them. I appreciated their accommodations and sincerity in apologizing, although I do not put any blame on them for the minor allergic reaction I had. Definitely recommend this spot. Good atmosphere is a plus too. Very kind staff made the experience a positive one for me, despite me having a slight reaction."}
{"text":"First time here for dinner on a Wednesday night. Very cool decor. Friendly staff greeted us at the door.  Explained the menu and the concept of the restaurant. We order the Ro Ro Burger, Shrimp and chips and yakatori. The open kitchen is very cool. Dinner was fantastic? We went back a 2nd time.  The menu did not interest us so. Nice place and nice people."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre. It was almost if they were trying too hard to be new and fresh. The burger on a English muffin was greasy and soggy, the fish tacos were undercooked, and the Korean Yakatori had too much dressing.  We sat outside in the front which was a mistake. The exhaust from the traffic coupled with the occasional smoking pedestrian made for a less than enjoyable encounter."}
{"text":"Went here today, Friday for lunch.  WOW.  What a great place.  Husband and son had Roro burgers which they loved, as well as the fries which they said were out of this world.  I had the amazing and delicious TJ tacos- so good.  Also great that they have happy hour prices if you would like to imbibe.  Great service, great food, great prices.  Eat here!"}
{"text":"Had an incredible burrito here. Also LOVE the atmosphere. Too cute. Def hope to come back."}
{"text":"Aside from the amazing atmosphere, the food and drinks are unique and anything but status quo! The owner has done an amazing job with making a great think out of such a small space. The food is delicious with great portions. The drinks are delicious and they're on happy hour everyday until 6pm! Probably one of the best happy hour spots in the area. Love, love, love and will continue to come back!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The drinks are awesome and sitting outside under the trees is amazing. The burgers are great. Fish tacos were also great. Attentive staff. Great downtown addition."}
{"text":"Modern and industrial neighborhood gem on Roosevelt. This spot has quickly become a favorite of mine and as reluctant as I am to share with the masses, it deserves to be enjoyed by many. And let's be real, I need this place to thrive so I have a place to go on my afternoons. I'll cut to the goodies you want (why we all yelp in the first place...) 
Reasons why I love this place: 
- Consistent and attentive (without bugging) service. From my very first visit, I was treated like a friend coming over for a drink. I feel comfortable coming here alone to work and study and never feel rushed. Food comes up quickly and thus far, I've never had something I didn't like and never had an order arrive wrong. 
- EXCELLENT FOOD AND COCKTAILS! Seriously. Try the Roro burger or fish tacos. TBH, everything is delicious AF. Can't go wrong. Sauces are flavor-packed, food is cooked to order, and is plated (or basketed?) with care. It's in the little details here and they've impressed me with their attention to them. 
- A REAL Happy hour. None of that \"we just have a drink special or $1 off wells/ tap/ etc.\" They do half off all alcoholic beverages including ALL of their lovely cocktails! I've always been meh about Paloma's but this place has made me fall in love with them. Happy hour is from open to 6pm I believe. 
- The atmosphere. Interesting music, small business feel, beautiful patio, simple and cute plant-based centerpieces. If you sit at the bar (you may find me there) it feels like you have a coveted kitchen seat with prime access to the bartender. 

TLDR. Eat here. Drink Here. You'll Enjoy it."}
