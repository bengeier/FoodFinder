{"text":"Fascinating interior deco. Kind staff very attentive and welcoming more than most places. Live band was cool but hard to talk over. Dark in some areas reading the menu a tad but challenging. Food was tasty we had:  Raw tacos: small but delicious  Meatballs: perfectly cooked, tomato sauce was on the sweet side, worth the order  Quail: looked spectacular on the plate, taste was good! But needed more of the sweet sauce which makes it pop.  The octopus and chorizo sausage: perfectly cooked octopus not chewy at all, great dish.  Drinks: mint gin drink was really good, however the old fashion was a disappointment  didn't taste like anything special.   Overall still a good experience!"}
{"text":"Great spot for Friday night. Music and the atmosphere here are so chill. Food was great. Drink selections were great. Only downside is that theres only one server so you will have to wait for service. Will I come back? Probably for drinks."}
{"text":"Came to Reverie for a birthday.   Very eclectic decor and staff.  Taxidermy animals in the window.  Nice big open space. Lots of room between tables so you don't feel cramped. Wonderful cool ambiance, low lighting with great sound track playing.   Staff are all great and super attentive   Cool cocktail list. Started with the Wood of the Bar. Jar filled with cedar woodsmoke, drink and ice in separate containers.  Open the jar, pour in the drink, add ice. Very nice, subtle wood flavours mixed with the drink. Very nice. Second one was Cartier's Discourse, tequila with cinnamon, chilli, lemon, Lillet Blanc and Effervescence. Wow, another amazing drink.   Started food with the Zuchini Radish Salad. Beautiful light and fresh. Great starter. Followed by the Gnocchi Fritti, an interesting take on an amazing ld tradition and ending with the wonderfully prepared Venison.  All the food was beautifully prepared and presented in a original and inventive way.   Really liked this, not yet so well know, hidden gem. Go now before it is impossible to get a table, because its going to happen."}
{"text":"Superb. Everything was delicious... especially the gnocchi. Excellent service too. Very low-key yet very knowledgable. It's a must try."}
{"text":"Gorgeous atmosphere. Stunning dishes. Great flavour. Delicious + unique cocktails. Seafood Dream was stunning to look at and eat. My favourite dish was the 5 Dates...the flavour combos were unreal. Rob was a great and very personable server. My friend and I had a super awesome experience. Highly recommend this restaurant! Even as a place to lounge at too."}
{"text":"We had an amazing dining experience. This is the type of place you walk in sit down and trust the chef and bartender to make your food and drinks. Highly recommended for anyone who wants a truly unique dining experience."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great cocktails and eats. Super nice staff. Great ambience. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"This is hands down the most exciting new restaurant I've experienced in Toronto. Reverie is not only a beautiful name for it, bet entirely apt. Walking into this place is like getting lost on your way to a fairytale. Between the tree roots hanging from the ceiling, the gate that separates the dining hall from the bar, and the sinister mannequin with ravens on either shoulder set on a stage that hosts live music, this place sets the tone with every detail. I stumbled in one night after spotting the illuminated owl in the front. It was such an incredible discovery. Having just had dinner, I took a seat at the bar and chatted with the bartender. He recommended the Wood of the Bar: a bourbon based cocktail which is literally smoked in front of your eyes by burning wood - of the bar. The flavour leaned toward a smoky orange peel rubbed against bark. Really nice. At that point, I knew I'd be back with my girlfriend as we had a 2 year anniversary coming up.   I made reservations for Sunday, and was supposed to meet her there at 6:30. At 6:30 though, it was still light outside. I wanted her to see it the way I saw it, so I spoke to a server there, Aiden, who switched my reservation to 7:30 and recommended a spot in front of the stage. As soon as she walked in, my girlfriend was blown away. The place was totally up her ally. She very rightly described it as Southern Gothic - it turns out New Orleans was a major influence in terms of its design. We decided to actually sit behind the gate as the band was a bit too loud considering we wanted to talk.  We started with cocktails. I had the Wood of the Bar (wanted her to see the presentation) and she had the Young Gypsy. Her cocktail was similarly magical in that it also used burning embers to produce a certain effect and taste.   The meal itself was outstanding. We had the manti, the chicken, the gnocchi, and the tartar. I love tartar more than anything, and this may have been the best tartar I've ever had. The chef had clearly deviated from the more traditional method of letting the meat be - instead he did what a great chef does and entirely elevated the flavour. The same goes for the gnocchi, which was unusually crisp with a delicious chewy centre. It was rich, but the ricotta cut into the richness beautifully. I'm Armenian, so when I read manti on the menu, I have a certain expectation. This was not close to any type of manti I've ever had growing up, but it was incredible in its own right. The braised rib tore apart almost like cheek, it was that soft.   Wess, the co-owner, did an impeccable job serving us. He was super friendly, helpful, and really made the night special for us. When I expressed my enthusiasm for the food, he let us know that it was the chef's birthday. After I offered to buy the mysterious chef a drink, he came out to say thanks. His name is Jeff, and I think he'll have no problem making a name for himself as a word-class chef. His dishes are all successfully experimental, and it's clear he's someone who thinks about food constantly. We overheard him talk to a server about a chocolate mushroom tart he was working on. Despite being very, very, full, we decided to try it. It was fantastic. Not too sweet at all, with the flavour of the mushroom really bringing out the earthy notes of the chocolate. It seems like an unlikely combination, but makes so much sense when you taste what he's come up with. Oh, and they also didn't charge us for it.  Overall, this is probably my new favourite restaurant in Toronto. Places like this make me love where I live."}
{"text":"Dave, the bartender is brilliant, responsible for creating the cocktail menu, and a pleasure to chat with. The man has an air of calm about him that is not common among bartenders and this creates an amazing atmosphere to enjoy a cocktail in!"}
{"text":"3/5 based on bar experience.  Weldon park is a pretty cute and romantic park inspired bar & restaurant. It's divided into three area: cozy loungish area, bar and restaurant. It has a perfect vibe for girls night or date night.   However, my experience at the bar wasn't as pleasent as the ambience of the place. On Thursday early evening, I went in to grab a drink while I'm waiting for my friends. I sat at the bar and trying to get attention from the bartender to order. He was busy checking his phone so I patiently waited him to notice me. It only took 15 mins for him to come to me when there were only two ppl sitting at the bar. When I finally ordered a simple cocktail, it took extra 20 mins because the bartender was too busy checking his phone, cleaning glasses and chatting with other ppl. When I got my drink, I was hoping it to be great since he took so much time and effort into thinking of making it. Unfortunately, it was just average. Not bad but not worth half an hr of frustration. I could have same quality drink with max 20 mins of waiting at other places along with more attentive service.   I might go back to check out their restaurant but it's not going to be any time soon."}
{"text":"Cool hip interior with great service, awesome menu and drinks, go enjoy some time there!"}
{"text":"Came on a Friday evening as a party of 3. The server recommended that we order ALL the sharing plates on the menu (there were 12 dishes total) as the portions were small. We were incredulous and ordered 4 dishes (chicken risotto with figs, duck with polenta peach and greens, salmon patty, and gnocchi). The dishes were good but not amazing, although the plating was beautiful.   They are all very small serving sizes and meant to be shared. The menu also changes frequently, so don't try to plan ahead what you want to order! I felt the prices were high for the portion size. We didn't order anything else and went to la carnita after to get chips and guacamole.   Service and ambiance were great. This place would be amazing for a date! I would definitely come back with a date to try their cool list of cocktails."}
{"text":"Saw a feature on blogTO and decided to come check it out and it as as described and as beautiful as it gets! The outside sign says \"Weldon Park\" as that's the bar name and Reverie the actual restaurant is at the back but it's connected but divided by a beautiful metal gate. Everything about this place is beautiful and whimsical. The front area is sectioned off like a little intimate seating area with some fake trees and benches and candles and a \"creepy\" little rocking horse lol. The middle is the beautiful bar with the cool tree roots hanging from the top. The bar top was beautiful as it's all glass with dried flowers and weed inside. Reverie itself continues this glass table top with flowers theme and also has Moroccan Lamps hanging from the top and super cute chalices on the tables. Food is small/med portions two ppl having 5 things was almost too much when we were also drinking. The food was really good! Bacon dates with truffle cheese was excellent. The meatballs had some special herbs in them that will surprise you, the aroncini was creative, the spicy shrimp has a good kick to it, least fave was the kimchi Fries bcos didn't taste the kimchi. But still good. Tried the Grapes drink and it's pretty good love the actual grapes in them and tried the rooibos beer from Ottawa which tasted ok but nothing special. The other drink with aloe and saffron in it was really good and refreshing. The apples one is more deep in its flavour and it was good but not won't be my go to. The service was excellent and the music was amazing! It's like cool lounge music or something. There's actually a mini dance floor right next to the bar but I this place just opened so it's not busy yet but I highly recommend for a romantic date night at a place with a cool vibe, good food, cool drinks, and good service"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night for a friend's birthday dinner. Our group was about 14 people and ... we were the only people in here. So not sure if Friday is their slow day or not but if we were looking for a happening vibe, this was not the place to be.  My husband and I ordered the Sriracha fries, meatballs, garlic bacon wrapped dates and Thai fried chicken. The fries were delicious (perfectly cooked, crispy in on the outside, soft on the inside). Dates probably were delicious but they give you one small date so if you really want to appreciate it probably order a few for yourself. Everything else was mediocre. Meatballs were okay and the Thai fried chicken was very soggy.   I found they were also a little stingy on the wine. For eleven dollars a glass, I don't think they gave me enough wine. The worst part of the evening was when we asked for dessert and they said they only had two panna cottas in the fridge to serve us? How can that be? We were the only ones in there! Anyway, the bday boy got one and we flipped a coin for who would get the other one. Afterwards the waiter told us that they don't even serve dessert but they had two panna cottas sitting in the fridge since Sunday! That turned my stomach. I don't even know how the waiter thought it was fine to tell us that. Anyway, overall it wasn't that bad, until the end of the night when we found out they served a few of our table with 5 day old dessert."}
