{"text":"This place is right around the corner from my house.  I was tipped off about their wings by a good friend and I've never looked back.  Great wings, the sweet potato fries are fantastic, and the regular fries come with a yummy dipping sauce.  It has a small patio out front in the summer.  Now the place can get busy when games are on so beware!"}
{"text":"I'm from California. I came to Toronto for their chicken wings. Well, not exactly... I actually came to Toronto to visit my boyfriend and his family during the NYE season. To get to Toronto I had to wait 13 hours in the Chicago O'Hare Airport since there was a snow storm in T-Dot. ...of course! The whole time I drew out my list of to-dos once in Toronto and yeah, you guessed it. My first honorary Canadian experience absolutely had to be to eat chicken wings and watch a hockey game. ....not a hard request to fulfill......??? :-)

I went with my bf and his amazingly cool bro and wife who sweared that this place was the best wings they've had in the city. Considering this is the city they grew up in I have to admit that their opinion carried some heavy weight in the wing classification system of awesomeness. 
With this recommendation in mind, I had to try St. Louis already infamously awesome wings now. 

One step inside and you can tell that this place is a no frills sports bar complete with LCD screen TVs lining the walls with the Toronto Maple Leafs playing. 

When looking at the menu to decide what to order I really enjoyed their eschelon of spiciness they were using. It went from Mild, Medium, Hot, Suicide, and the who could forget \"Hotter Than Hell\". 

I ordered the Hot and the Suicide in double orders....because, I can. 

When my wings were served I noticed that what makes these wings different is that they are fried first and then dipped in sauce making them crunchy and spicy, which is a nice combination, I think.  Before I took a bite I leaned down to my plate and took a whiff of the bony delights. I really like a chicken wing that once served you can actually smell the spice rippling up your nose like a tornado. These wings did the trick. 

I wish they had one of these places in San Mateo, California. I'd go there, definitely.

While I wish I went to an authentic Toronto chicken wing place on my trip and not a franchised stop I have to admit that this place was a winner and it came highly recommended to me from Toronto natives that swear by these wings."}
{"text":"The wings are so-so at St. Louis, don't come here if prefer your wings on the extra saucy side. A pal and I ordered a 18 wing basket in the hot flavor and a 9 wing basket in the cajun dust. (Yes we were ravenous for wings that night.)

\"Hot\" was not so hot and on the dry side as they are fried and sloshed with a bit of sauce afterwards. However the terrific dill dipping sauce and our requested side of hot sauce for dunking enhanced our wing eating experience. Cajun dust wings are a nice departure from the standard crispy hots, they are fried wings covered in a herb-spice mix afterwards. Fries are nothing special, the thick steak fries variety.

We came on bike night, it seems at this particular location on wednesdays hordes of motorcycle enthusiasts come out to enjoy some wings and beer. Not a bad idea, given the decent quality of wings and the standard selection of mainstream beers on tap! A even better night to head out to St. Louis is on Tuesdays this is when they hold their 9 wing/18 wing basket specials!"}
{"text":"You come here. You get beer and wings. Maybe ribs. Don't be adventurous and get something else as you would be severely disappointed. St. Louis is pretty good, just like all the other St. Louis in the city, it's a sports bar with their specialty being fried anything.

When I came here I got chicken wings, fries, and a few pitchers of beer. It was a good night out. Wings are crunchy and spicy the way they should be. What I really like about these wings is that they aren't really battered and are kinda sweet. It's a spicy sweet chicken wing, almost like they but a bit of BBQ sauce on the lil suckers.

Decor is typical of what you would find at a sports bar; T.V.s, bar, tables, chairs, and the like. Nothing really stands out in this decor but it's a comfortable one. The service was on point. Our server was nice and was quick to get us a new pitcher when asked.

Overall, it is a good place for wings and beer. Prices are reasonable and  definitely worth it asthey have different specials on different nights, which is always a plus because that means half priced wings on some nights! Not anything special but does the trick and does it well."}
{"text":"So, you go and open up a wing place, franchised no less, and you do it, not only in a place that has housed some long-since-defunct restaurants and bars that flitted in their identity between restaurant and dance bar and never really figured themselves out, but you set up right across from one of the best wing places in town.  Huh.  What do you think is going to happen?

Right across the street from the Wheat Sheaf (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/wheat-sheaf-tavern-toronto) (well down the street a wee bit, but close enough for horseshoes) is St. Louis Wings.  Found at street level in an office building that houses the broadcasting studios for the Business News Network (BNN), it's pristine, bright, finished in hard wood, it's definitely business friendly.  Maybe that's the problem.

When I picture a wing place, I don't think \"surgical theatre\".  Now, I don't think that you should go into a wing place and get three different kinds of diseases upon completion.  Nor am I saying that St. Louis on King West is that sterile, but it is a bit dull.  For a place that is supposed to evoke images of St. Louis ribs and chicken being created, it feels more like a pubby-bar family restaurant, inoffensive and bland.  In my times there, I've found the wings match the d√©cor.  Not much wrong with them, but definitely not worth the trip across the street from the Sheaf."}
{"text":"Beer and chicken wings, how can you go wrong - and the signature dill dipping sauce is delish!"}
