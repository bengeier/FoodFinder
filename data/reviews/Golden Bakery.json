{"text":"WOW ! First time I had Syrian desserts, it was so FRESH !  The pita bread was so fresh right out of the oven still warm. The pistachio beklawa was so good.  

I suggest all the yelpers out there should try this place. You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Tasty food, very cheap, and friendly owners. Check it out."}
{"text":"Saw a write up in CL late last night and was in the general vacinity today, so went  on the hunt... only the basic coordinates
\"near the intersection of Sharon Amity and Albermarle roads..\" in fact it is wedged between Ali Baba which I have never been to 
and a Middle Eastern grocery that I will visit next time I am in the mood for some goat. I think it is in the old Jeruselem restaurant 
location. We ordered 2 manakish, sort of flat bread pizzas that were brown and bubbly, 1 mohamra and 1 with eggs and cheese
both of which were really good. Khaled / Khalid (?) brought us 2 cookies that I think were basically date stuffed short bread, that had great texture
and not too sweet. On the way out the pita was coming out of the oven,  warm, soft and puffy  ..1.59 for 4 ...(Take that Harris Teeter).
Khaled told us about the pastries most of which are sold by the pound, and I got 2 of what looked like  Baklava but had a cheeseish firm custard
inside, and were not super sweet, which is perfect for me and doesn't make the keyboard sticky!

The place has been open for about 3 weeks so they are still making changes.  It is a bakery with a few tables so it is functional but a bit sparse.

Go in a buy some Pita !"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get authentic Middle Eastern pastries- they have several kinds of baklava, as well as warbat, which is my favorite. Also the pita bread is wonderful!"}
{"text":"A friend and I popped in quickly to pick up some pita bread after a quick run through the halal market next door... at least that's what we MEANT to do. There was hot markouk coming out when we arrived so we ordered one just as it came off but the manager was having none of that and after we sat down he passed us a huge sampling of fatayer. The markouk was delicious and the fatayer was absolutely amazing! We tried beef, chicken, spinach and feta and one with what tasted like a slightly pickled spinach or other green. The bad news is we'd just come from having Korean food so we were already stuffed.. the worse news is that didn't stop us from diving in and loving every bite! I'd say if you think it's yummy when you're already well fed then you know it's really that way!"}
{"text":"This is the best bakery around! The owner has always been really helpful and explains what the pastries and foods are which I really appreciate. The ovens are so authentic as are the wonderful foods. You can taste the difference. I am enjoying a delicious pastry from here with a tea right this very moment. If you want to have the pleasure of enjoying a real bakery then this is something you should definitely try. I will be coming back.:)"}
{"text":"Wow, this bakery is amazing! The sweets are absolutely delicious and as good as my mother's (she's from Syria).  The pies are also SUPER tasty and fresh!  My wife and I tried the meat and the chicken and both were great, but the chicken was our favorite.  We'll be going back for cheese and spinach as soon as possible.  I only wish that they would open another Golden Bakery in Huntersville, NC so that we could go more often.  Oh, and in response to Allspice S. who reviewed on 8/14/2012 the gentleman who helped us wore plastic gloves when handling our sweets and pies so you'd be pleased.  He was also very helpful and friendly.  If you are looking for authentic, fresh, and delicious Middle Eastern food than Golden Bakery is for you!"}
{"text":"great cheese pitas  and dessert! The owner is also super helpful.  He explained to me and my husband what each item was and also gave us his suggestions.  We bought a bunch of different types that came straight out of the oven hot.  We literally sat in the car and devoured it."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Everything is freshly made, Great Service but they should remember \"cleanliness in next to Godliness\".  Please WASH hands more often! We smoke, cough, sneeze and handle cash/cards and then go and touch my delicious treats, not good.  Outside of this, which I think is super important, they would get 5 stars.  The deserts are very tasty but usually on the well done side."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh pita breads!    Only place in town that I've been able to find really yum breads like this.  i always stock up,"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place a lot but all in all I was disappointed.  This middle eastern haven was well reviewed and was quite genuine located in an inexpensive part of town in a strip center with several Middle East food trucks parked adjacent which actually looked quite interesting.  Next door was a kabob place that looked like it had possibilities and s hookah bar which did not, at least to me. 
This business is supposed to consist of three aspects: a bakery, an ethnic grocery store with a butcher and a restaurant.  I think the restaurant is an exaggeration.  As best I can tell. It consisted of s couple tables where you could eat what you bought at the bakery.
There was a great guy working the counter in the bakery.  He was very helpful and willing to answer each of my ceaseless questions.  There were not too many  goods to look at.  The Syrian bread, the impetus for my visit was really pretty good.  I would have loved to taste them warm fresh out of their brick oven and I wondered how long they had sat there bagged.  But still, all in all, pretty good.   I also bought for if their pies which are small and with pretty pastry.  There is a minimum of four.  The spinach were pretty delicious, the chicken which was pretty good and the beef which was better than just okay.  They also sell s variety of baklava which they didn't have, a variety of macaroons which I took a pass on, something they called pizza which didn't look exciting to me, yogurt which the guy who worked there said was made there and similar to but thicker than Greek yogurt but still didn't sound too enthusiastic about, and that was about if.  I had been hoping to take Home some of the delicious side dishes that the middle eastern cultures are famous for.
Then into the densely crowded and stocked grocery store.  It was filled with items I was unfamiliar with and had there been anybody to ask I'm sure I would have purchased snd tried a few items.  I had been in particular been looking forward to the butcher shop area.  They advertised goat and lamb and I was planning on bringing home some goat chops and some interesting cuts and maybe some advice.  I got none of these.  There were only a couple things in the counter and some frozen things in a heap on a cooler.  There was a guy working there but he ignored me so I took a pass.  There was a sign quoting forty bucks to use their saw which was certainly unique to see in s grocery store.  I wonder if that was s good price.  On The way out, a guy carried in s dead goat.  That was also unique and I wonder if it was headed to the saw!?  
The guy who checked me out (I did buy a bag of coos coos) was not very outgoing do I failed yo learn as much as I wanted on what were the true possibilities of this business.  I probably will try it again sometime maybe in a Friday when I hear the bakery is better stocked.  So, I'd say I am disappointed based on other reviews which had brought me here but still hopeful."}
{"text":"It took us a couple of weeks to get to the Golden Bakery following the Charlotte Observer writeup, but it only took us 3 days to return. Our lack of familiarity with the cuisine was not even the slightest problem; all we had to do was ask for recommendations and we were served a variety of tasty dishes. Everything is delicious, from the \"pizza\" to the fatayer, to the entire case of pastries. On our first trip, we were stuffed when we were leaving, but had to go back in to buy some of the fresh from the oven naan. It was irresistible and we had no problem finding some way to eat some more on the way home. We will definitely return for a third trip and more."}
{"text":"Best Bread in Town!!!  This is a SERIOUS Bakery!  Huge OPEN Kitchen!  Breads and Middle Eastern Desserts!  I have eaten a bunch of these Desserts, the only one I know the name of is Baklava!  Today I'm getting some still warm Flat bread similar to Pita Bread!!!

Mostly Takeout, though they do have some tables!  I'll be back with my Camera to get the next treats!"}
{"text":"Got a groupon coupon in email today and decided to head over to try it out. 

LOVED the bread! 

I bought fresh pita made in the brick oven, a date/sesame round bread, and a bread that is flat and looks 'grilled' they make it in the oven. It is called Naan bread like pita without the pocket and its made in a tandoori oven!  Must try it - I know I'll be back. Very soft, light, moist not dry like Italian or French breads. I love these types of breads. Wonderful with hummus, or olive tapenade etc. 

I bought a sample of every syrian sweet they had except for the cookies on the bottom shelf (I forgot!).  KENAFAH was great! It had what looked like thin noodle threads on the outside, one had cinnamon and I think its a cheese mixture that tastes creamy, like ricotta. REALLY good! 

There are many different types of what I call Baklava (one is spelled Baklawa)  (they have different names and are not made with honey) Almond, cashews, pistachio, I think Walnut etc. Finally there were pistachios sesame seed flat cookies that isn't on the menu below but LOVED LOVED them and so did my kids.  

The difference between Syrian and Greek desserts is Syrian/Lebanese do not use Honey they use Rose or Orange Blossom water. I actually prefer it because its less sweet than honey. The taste doesn't deteriorate the flavor and you can eat more of them without being overwhelmed by the sweetness like you would with honey lol!

I had the round borma which was probably my favorite if I had to pick one ....though the cookies may have been better. 

Also purchased different types of open faced and closed (like little empanadas) \"meat/cheese/veggie\" stuffed little pies called Fatayer. Not overloaded with meat (wish they were because they were YUMMY!) but great to slice and eat as a snack or a side if you had a nice bowl of soup. I tried the sausage, chicken, beef, spinach and cheese. Really enjoyed them!

All in all, I am so glad I found this place, Syrian, Lebanese, Greek food is so healthy for you and so hard to find in Charlotte NC. I am from NJ and miss the different types of baking/cooking. The person that I met at the bakery is from Upstate NY so he knew what I meant when I said I wish Charlotte had more variety of food lol! All in all, do yourself a favor and take a ride over. 

NOTE....the mall/store front can put you off but don't let it. There were a few of the local stragglers hanging around outside but the bakery is nice and clean, open and its worth the effort it takes to look past the store front to get home baked breads and sweets! 

He told me that they just took over the Aly Baba restaurant next door and cater to vegan and vegetarian in their menu. GREAT for my daughter.

{"text":"Best middle eastern baked pies I've had in USA..wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised..had some cheese and meat flatbread (mna'eesh) and then ordered 20 to take back to Atlanta for my freezer..best quick breakfast and snack.

The prices are unbelievably low, large variety of flat bread, pita bread, naan. Also saw two fridges of sweets like baklava, haliwet el jibin, eysh el saraya and more. Service was amazing...we asked to eat 4 different pies and he cut them up and served them with pickles and vegetables. Didn't leave a crumb in our plates.
We are planning to drive back in a month to load up on pies and bread again.

The bakery is open everyday but has only been open for 4mths so they don't have a website or directory...the contact is below

Love this place"}
{"text":"The pastries at Golden Bakery cannot be beat! Every visit, we get a giant box of assorted baklava. Favorites are the pistachio and \"mixed nuts.\" I also love the semolina cake and the cone shaped one wrapped in the shredded corn flake thingies. (Highly technical term, I know.) Every piece tastes like it's soaked in honey, rose water, and the tears of a unicorn. They're seriously magical. 

There are a few tables to sit and eat or you can take your sweets to go. There's also a small grocery store attached with lots of fun, international finds. I've heard good things about their pizza but haven't had a chance to try one, yet. Maybe in the cards for my next visit!"}
{"text":"This is a for real Syrian bakery. The kanefeh is almost as good as you can get int the Middle East. Baklava is excellent as well. I understand they have the little middle eastern \"pizzas\" (can't remember the name). Will need to try those sometime as well."}
{"text":"I stopped by Golden Bakery right after I had an excellent meal at Nile. It was relatively late in the night, around 8:15, and this seemed to effect the sort of service that we received (which is totally reasonable). Still, the staff was kind and answered all of our questions about their large pastry case and offering recommendations. 

I will say that you cannot buy desserts individually, because you at least have to purchase a fourth of a pound of food. Although this ended up only being two pieces of baklava and a cookie, it still may have been nice to know this in advance.

My friend and I tried two types of baklava, both pistachio and walnut as well as a semolina date cookie. The pistachio baklava was the winner of the night- absolutely the best I have ever had! In addition, the date cookie was an interesting combination of sweet and savory with the semolina flour and it felt a little like a fig newton while eating it! Definitely not complaining about that. 

Overall, enjoyed my experience at this bakery! Only wish I would have known in advance their limits on purchasing, but now that I have my expectations straight I will go in hungry! Definitely give it a try, especially if you're craving baklava or wanting to explore."}
