{"text":"Une des meilleures pizza que j'ai mangé à Montréal. Excellent mélange de légumes marines, et de pancetta. Sinon essayez la pizza au homard et au bacon. Le restaurent possède son propre bar à Mozzarella et n'hésite pas a agrémenter la plupart de ses pizzas de ce fromage. La mozzarella du bufalla est comparable à celle que l'on retrouve à Rome."}
{"text":"Visited Mangiafoco while attending the Canadian GP. We had an opportunity to try several things from the menu. Interesting layout with staggered levels and seating at different levels. We were at the top so we could look down the long to the front of the restaurant.

Started with Calamari and Burrata caprese to which we added a side of salami. The burrata and tomatoes were very fresh and the salami was excellent thinly sliced and full of flavor. A nice touch was two small squeeze bottles of EVOO and Balsamic to put on the cheese, tomatoes and salami. Also a basket of fresh bread to go along with it.

The calamari was nothing special, but the spicy tomato sauce was very good.

Also ordered a Caesar salad which was an interesting twist by using a small head of romaine with a nice dressing, some pieces of bacon and shaved parmesan cheese. It was very good.

Ordered two pizzas: a classic margherita and Pizza Catania - smoked chicken, roasted cherry tomatoes and peppers with some slices of avocado an basil. Both pizzas had excellent flavor and were well cooked, but I did not think the dough was up to the other ingredients. It was just too soft for me, clearly needed some harder durum flour or something.

Interesting but pricey drinks on the menu. Service was ok.

I would give Mangiafoco 4 stars except, it is really too pricey for the portions."}
{"text":"Really awesome food and menu. Lots of great drinks and a fairly extensive wine list. The mozzarella bar is incredible, I wish I could buy their cheeses. Pizza is fantastic as well.

The place loses a star on price, it's a bit expensive for the portion sizes (28 for 200g of cheese c'mon).

Service is right for the price, location is busy on a weekend.

I like this place, very unique offerings, I would for sure check it out."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza on in Montreal. 
Very fresh and tasty ingredients.
Decor is interesting and staff is attentive.
Very nice experience overall.

Tips: Ask the staff which wine to get. It worked very well for us."}
{"text":"De ma place, j'avais une vue sur tout le restaurant et derrière moi se trouvait un potager de basilic. Je ne crois pas avoir vu un décor de resto plus intéressant que celui là jusqu'à maintenant! Des tables en escaliers, de grosses banquettes noires, des bars par-ci par-là, des chaises et des tabourets dépareillés. Un plafond presque entièrement recouvert d,ampoules rouges et blanches. Plusieurs paliers qui donnent une dimension très intéressante au restaurant. Des murs de briques rouges et des planchers et pierres polies. Bref, j'ai été conquise par le décor. 

Sur l'heure du dîner, l'endroit offre une table d'hôte entrée & plat pour 20$. Les entrée nous ont été servies sur des plaques de granite. Présentation simple, mais bien. Toutes nos entrées étaient délicieuses! 

Pour ce qui est des plats, encore une fois tout était très bon. Les pizzas sont à pâte mince, mais croûte assez épaisses. Le meilleur des deux mondes. Et la salade de pommes et proscuitto était magnifique et super bonne. 

GROS BÉMOL: le service. Nous étions servis par, je crois, le gérant de salle.... ! Un peu d'enthousiaste et de considération de sa part aurait été agréable. Lorsqu'il nous a expliqué les plats du jour, ce n'était pas clair et il ne nous donnait pas envie du tout. Il nous a ensuite suggéré des cocktails, encore une fois avec un ton blasé (si vous connaissez un mot plus blasé que \"blasé\", remplacez-le). 

J'ai trouvé un poil dans ma pizza... Je le lui ai dis.... Personnellement, je travaille en restaurant aussi... À sa place, je me serais excusée au nom du restaurant et en aurait refaire une ou aurait offert quelque chose... Il m'a plutôt répondu \"ah oui? un poils.... ah.... dans votre pizza... vous voulez qu'on la refasse ou ça va?\" Non, ça va. Habituellement, n'importe quel serveur après un incident du genre serait allé en cuisine, dire de faire attention! Il est plutôt allé au bar siroté son verre d'eau et voilà.... 

Bref. Allez-y, l'endroit est magnifique, branché et jeune, je vous souhaite d'être servis par quelqu'un d'autre."}
{"text":"First put up a sign up with your name we can read in the dark. Jumbled up letters is not a sign.

Pizza is over priced and my backyard brick oven makes way better. Service went out of their way to avoid our cramped table by the wall. It was amusing how often they would walk by and never look our way.

$21 10 inch mushroom pizza really? $21 for 10 inch.. repeat after me NO!

Maybe this place is trying too hard to be trendy vs good food for a good value.

Go elsewhere nothing missed here."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients as far as produce is a must (I don't eat beef or pork) so this joint nailed it for quality greens and spices. Wines were a tad pricy but quality nonetheless."}
{"text":"Quel bel endroit ! Ambiance est parfaite et c'est aussi un des meilleure spot pour manger de bonne pizza avec des produits italien de qualités ! 

La mozzarela di buffala est divine ! Vous devez lessayer ! De plus le restaurant est tres bien situé dans le vieux port de montreal !"}
{"text":"The restaurant was a nice space, although the two of us were placed in a very narrow table, against the wall. The wine list was good. Ordered mozzarella di buffala with sides, the cheese was delicious, but the sides were just ok (truffle carpaccio- very good, grilled asparagus (no flavour), truffled peaches (just ok), marinated artichokes (tasted straight out of the jar), and the cantalop and cilantro salad (just melon cut up with cilantro thrown on top still on the stalk). We had to ask for bread for accompaniment, and were only given a few slices and never offered more. Shared a pizza Margherita with the mozzarella di buffala, was ok, the crust was tasteless- much better options elsewhere in Montreal. Overall, we spent 165$ for 1 bottle of wine (40$) and the above listed food... Very expensive and we left hungry and not having really enjoyed our meal. Moreover, the music was too loud, and club-like, despite the fact that on Sat night, most clients were couples on a date. Service was also lacking. Would not recommend and will not be going back. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner and wonderful staff. Eric treated us like family. I am from Texas and was here for a work trip while it happened to be my birthday and they did not disappoint. The mozzarella bar and all the sides were to die for. The wine selection was beyond amazing."}
{"text":"Tastefully unusual décor, overpriced wine list and warden-style service. But you can definitely eat great things there.

While the mozzarella bar gimmick has its charm and the freshness of all the things we tasted that night was indisputable, I am not quite sure that I would return. 

14$ for an average Negroni cocktail was definitely off-putting."}
{"text":"Though service was excellent, the food was a travesty. Beyond the fact my mom found a huge long hair in her food, the pizza was dry and salty, and tasted of little else besides burnt bread. The poached egg on my Campagna had the consistency of muccus, and the prosciutto was like eating jerky. The artichokes on my moms pizza were basically made of vinegar, and the arugala placed, apparently, to hide the horror beneath. Though they comped my barely eaten pizza, my mother's (who towards the end, found a hair) was not taken off the bill. Despite kind service, this is not sufficient to warrant my ever returning."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and arugula salad. Casual. Good service. Nice space. Only negative was the high wine prices."}
{"text":"I finally got to try this resto out with my group of foodie friends after reading all the great reviews. I must say I am still puzzled at what is so great about this resto. In terms of ambiance, yes the resto decor is trendy and modern looking so I would give them that much. However, service was ok at best as we we repeatedly reminded that we had our table until 9pm and our reservation was 6:30pm. Now for the food, one word Disappointing. The entrees were ok at best. We all ordered pizzas which are overpriced for the quality. Pizza lacked taste and did not taste like traditional neapolitan wood oven pizza. I ordered the pesto pizza which tasted awful. I must also mention dessert. I ordered the tiramisu thinking that at least would be ok. I was wrong again..instead of traditional lady finger cookies they used this hard as a rock cake like bottom. It ruined the whole dessert. Perhaps the chef had a off night and we were unlucky to have chosen that night but the food overall was nothing to write home about. The cocktails and drinks are also overpriced. However, this resto is located in the old port which caters to the tourist mass. Food quality is what impresses me most about restos and this one just failed to do so."}
{"text":"Cet endroit est le resto que je ne me fais manquer quand je suis à Montreal.
Et pas seulement parce que je suis fan de Simple Plan (retour à la jeunesse XD) et je rêve secrètement de les rencontrer dans ce resto que le guitariste Jeff Stinco a ouvert il y a quelques année.

J'adore la déco postindustrielle, moderne mais pas froide. L'accueil et le service toujours professionnels. Les produits de première qualité et les pizzas certainement pas traditionnelles pour un italien (moi) mais tout simplement exquises.

Ce soir on a commencé avec des calamars en entrée, tout en sirotant nos longdrinks (mention spéciale pour  le waste management!) et on a continué avec les pizzas. Celles si sont absolument parfaites : les ingrédients sont bien dosés et de haute qualité , la pâte légère goûteuse et croustillante.

On a fini avec un gâteau au citron et un tiramisu (je suis désolé de le dire, seul bémol du diner : il était pas mauvais mais certainement pas à la hauteur du reste. Et c'est la première fois en 3 ans que je trouve quelque chose a dire de ne soit pas super positive!).

Même si je suis très déçu de ne pas avoir rencontré JS ou les autres membres du groupe (un jour je vous aurais ! XD ) vous ne pouvez pas ne pas aimer ce restaurant. 
C'est juste le top, essayer pour croire !"}
{"text":"The place is gorgeous! The staff are as good and professional as good looking! 
The pizzas are straight from heaven with fresh ingredients 
The prices are good for a restaurant in tha neighborhood 
Good thing i live far from there or I would always be eating there ! :) 
-
La place est superbe ! Les employés en plus d'êtres beau sont professionels ! 
Les pizzas goutent le ciel ! Et sont fait avec des ingredients frais 
Les prix sont bons pour un restaurant dans se coin 
Heureusement que je reside loin de là car sinon jy serais toujours ! :)!"}
{"text":"On a testé ce restaurant avec des amis après avoir entendu de bonnes critiques. La décoration est originale, on s'y sent bien, le service est rapide et le menu bien garni. 
Mais, j'ai été déçue de ma pizza 4 fromages, vraiment pas assez garnie, je cherchais le fromage, à ce prix-là je m'attendais à plus que 4 bouts de mozza.  Pour l'accompagner, j'ai opté pour un verre de vin à 12$, quelle déception quand j'ai vu que le verre était rempli à moitié.  Si au départ j'étais lancé pour prendre un dessert je me suis retenue de peur d'être déçue.  Au final, quand j'ai vu ma facture, j'ai compris que je ne retenterai pas l'expérience, bien trop cher pour ce qu'il y avait dans nos assiettes.  C'est dommage car le cadre est agréable !"}
{"text":"Best gluten free pizza in Old Montreal, great ambiance, super friendly staff. Can be hard to get in, especially on a weekend but worth the wait."}
{"text":"6 people came and ate what they all claimed to be the best pizza in Canada. Kids turned down dessert and asked for more pizza. I had a gluten free pizza with buffalo mozzarella. Very happy with my pizza. It's hard to make a gf pizza and this one was epic."}
{"text":"I had their vermouth blanc and rogue. Best drink I've had made for me. Flavor was ON FLEEK!!"}
{"text":"Over the top friendly service. Great atmosphere. The burrata is heaven on earth. Really a special place."}
{"text":"So, we really wanted to like this place.  Has all the things we look for: trendy atmosphere, good menu, swanky staff...y'know, the usual when out and about in a fun city on a Friday night. Sadly, although they accommodated us right away without a reservation, the food was so sub-par. We shared a salad and margherita bufala pizza.  So average.  The pizza particular had no taste and it looked better than it tasted. Wine was fine as was the selection.  We wished we had gone elsewhere for our hyped up Friday night dinner."}
{"text":"Very nice place! Good menu, lots of choices :)"}
{"text":"J'adore l'endroit! D'abord, j'adore les pizzas italiennes à croûte mince et quoi de mieux que de la manger dans un restaurant aussi beau que bon! C'est parfait pour un repas intime ou entre amis pour un 5@7! 

Je vous conseille vraiment le bar à buffala! La mozzarella est divine et vous pouvez l'assaisonner à ce que vous voulez ou presque! Un must du restaurant !"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff and excellent food! Great recommendations for drinks and pairings with cheeses."}
{"text":"Service with laughs and genuine smiles and friendliness. Plus the pizza was excellent! The restaurant is fun and interesting, lots to look at.  Great menu, lots of choices.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Simply delicious. I went there to celebrate the end of a session with one of my friend. Close to the metro station in the old port of Montreal, the place is welcoming to say the least.
We started with and entree of calamari and polpette. The calamari while small in comparison to what I'm use to were fresh and crispy. The sauce that was going with it, a kind of arabiatta sauce was just spicy enought to tickle the palate.
My friend had the prociutto pizza while I was delecting  myself with the lobster and bacon one. I'm use to wooden oven pizza but that one, great just great. The lobster was bacon were tender enought and the dough cook perfectly.
The only downside to this place are the seats, we had to change place twice before finding a comfy enough seat to give a proper salute to that meal. Definitely a place I'll return"}
{"text":"You're probably reading reviews here, wondering if this is a good pizza place. Stop reading and go to Mangiafoco. Seriously, just turn off your cell or computer and eat here.

Everything was excellent - the foie gras appetizer, the IPA, the wine, the service, the pizza. Oh man, the pizza. I still dream about it. My girlfriend and I were both very hungry, so we got two pizzas with the intention of taking the leftovers home. The Carbonara had more subtle flavors, and the egg on top was cooked just right, so the yolk was still runny - and oh man did it taste great with the rest of the pizza. My favorite was the Fuoco, which has a warning that it's spicy. \"Not spicy, but balanced,\" the waiter said. It was spicy with just the right amount of heat. I love spicy food so this was a home run for me.

They also have a mozzarella bar, which looked interesting. Try it if you can, but whatever you do, don't miss out on the amazing pizza.

Are you still reading this? Turn it off and eat here!"}
{"text":"Cela faisait un bon petit moment que je voulais tester cet endroit. Fan de mozza, je ne sais pas pourquoi j'ai attendu aussi longtemps pour y aller. Il s'agit d'un bar à mozzarella - allo un bar à Mozza ... le paradis est à portée de main :D La place est vraiment sympa, avec les lumières tamisées, c'est cosy, c'est intimite, c'est idéal pour un rendez-vous, un tête à tête ou même pour une sortie entre filles. Son jazz, lounge en fond, pas trop dérangeant, juste parfait pour nous mettre dans l'ambiance des lieux. On nous donne la liste des vins et cocktails. Elle est longue, mais la serveuse est là pour nous aider. Elle vient régulièrement à notre table, nous prenons notre temps, mais elle ne nous presse aucunement. On choisit un Pinot Grigio parfait pour accompagner notre entrée de calamars. Ce ne sont pas les meilleurs que j'ai goûté, mais ma foi il n'était pas du tout mauvais. La sauce aurait pu avoir plus de saveur, plus de peps. C'était une sauce tomate qui n'aidait pas à rehausser le goût de nos calamar. Puis, nous avons partagé la pizza 2 champs: \"crème montée à l'ail confit, morille, shiitake, mozza fior di latte, parmigiano, huile truffée et persil \" EUHHHH yummy!!!!! C'était vraiment savoureux, un petit bé mol, certaines parties de la pizza étaient nettement trop cuites.
Bref, service impeccable, bel établissement, bonne ambiance et on aime le concept de bar a mozza. Je reviendrais très certainement pour découvrir le menu :)"}
{"text":"Small cozy place with delicious pizza and surprisingly good wine list. Nice selections of mozzarella. Beer choices are slim but well considered...try the Quebec brewed Rousse.   When I'm in Montreal I usually come here for drinks and pizza."}
{"text":"Hold the phone!!!  2 words.  Mozzarella bar.  What more can anyone need in life than fresh, creamy, melty burrata???  I have dined here on a few occasions and have nothing but great things to say.  The meatballs (although expensive) are tender and good, the pizzas, delicious, but the mozzarella bar.....  pure heaven.  The staff is friendly and service very efficient.  Love this place (although on a Saturday, the music is way too loud, and in fact, no clue why they have a DJ)."}
{"text":"I (finally!) got to try Mangiafoco during lunchtime and it was de-li-cious !! 

We had the burratina mozzarella as a starter which was a rich, creamy, yummy, fresh cheese ! Enjoyed it with a lovely half-dried and smoked tomatoes, fresh tomatoes, artichokes and basil salad. Perfect !

As our mains we shared two pizzas, one with a great mix of mushrooms and another one with mortadella, prosciutto and fresh mozzarella. They were delicious ! You can definitely tell how fresh the ingredients are. Loved it. 

I did not see the bill but I do believe the prices are a bit high. But definitely worth it. I hadn't enjoyed such fresh and yummy pizza in quite a while and the mozzarella bar is totally worth the try ! 


I will be back. And back again, and again :)"}
{"text":"The pizzas are good. We came here for my surprise birthday dinner on a Friday night. The restaurant was very busy. The tasting menu looked interesting but the waitress said 10 people had to participate and not everyone was down to share a bunch of cheeses and pizzas for $40. 

My boyfriend and I shared the caprese salad with burrata. We also shared a fuoco pizza and the carbonara pizza. I preferred the latter. I chose the fuoco  because the fuoco pizza is supposed to be spicy but it wasn't that spicy. It's as if you put chili oil or chili flakes on it. I still added the chili oil to the pizza. It had tomato sauce, mozzarella, casalingo salami , red pepper and citrus zest sour cream. I think the pizza would have been better without the citrus zest. 

The carbonara had garlic confit cream sauce, a soft boiled egg, pancetta, grana padano cheese which is comparable to Parmesan cheese and green onion.

My friends were raving about the prosciutto pizza so I want to come back and try it!"}
{"text":"Not worth it!! Pizza has too much flour, not properly dressed ( arugula goes over the prosciutto...not under). Dessert was blahhh and espresso was HORRIBLE!!! Oh and service was not the best either!!"}
{"text":"In the heart of old Montreal, steps from Notre Dame. Gorgeous decor. Downhill from there. Only one pasta on the menu, cannelloni which is very pricey and is an appetizer portion and really not good. The format is to build an appetizer, every item is pricey, portions are small and the pickled vegetables are not even of the finer imported variety, they are of the common commercially packaged types. Presentation was nice, but that's it! Something we can do at home. The only thing that was really delicious and well prepared was the octopus, but the portion was shamefully small and at the exorbitant price, we didn't bother ordering another. They specialize in Pizza, so it would have to be amazing, or at least good.....you would think. Sauce was not tasty or luscious, it was bland and undercooked. Size of the pizza was small and still there were a few pieces left over because it wasn't worth the bother. Our server was rude and made an issue when I didn't leave a tip. Asked if there was anything she could do to \"adjust\" the service. A little too late as I'm about to walk out the door. I'm guessing that the location attracts patrons, cannot imagine this business sustaining itself on repeat business or word of mouth. Definitely not a good experience!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? The place was booked up, even in a Monday, but we snagged two spots at the bar, easily. The entire staff was fun, attentive and knowledgeable. The veal meatballs are so tender they'll make you cry. The pizza crust regardless of pizza, is excellent. I love the mozz bar: pick your mozzarella and a few sides to Choose Your Own App Adventure :-) Save room for the white chocolate mousse!"}
{"text":"Nouveau spot très intéressant, dynamique, design, belle cuisine autour de la convivialité italienne. Originalité: un bar à mozzarella. Intrigant. Formule lunch 2 plats pour 20$, la carte du soir à l'air attrayante. On y retourne!"}
{"text":"The staggered seating at multiple elevations maximizes the space while allowing the sense of privacy. Love the selection of original pizzas which includes lobster and a nightly special (venison was the feature the evening that we dined there).  I'd recommend the Guanciale with mint and spicy peppers. Stunning."}
{"text":"Mangiafoco is great for consistently delicious Italian in a nice, higher-end setting. Service is good, but the food is even better... and I'm a huge fan of their charcuterie plate

Recommended"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great pizza. I'd recommend the fuoco pizza. It's a bit spicy but it's fantastic. This place is expensive for the amount of portions you get but you're paying for the atmosphere and flavors more than the portions."}
