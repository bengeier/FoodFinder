{"text":"I normally go to the place on brickyard.  However I was in the area and a friend said the place was good.   I will now compare the 2 places. 
Price   the same   1/2 chicken dinner under $10.  
Quality the same. 
This place the sauce is on the side, brickyard smother the sauce on the chicken. 
My opinion brick yard does a little better in the presintation.  This place uses a Styrofoam  tray brick yard uses an aluminum  container.    
Also the portion size of the rice and potatoes is much larger at Brickyard.   
Customer service.  they are both great.

If you are going to go here you will not disappointed."}
{"text":"We placed a catering order for pick up. I had never eaten here before but I was in a bind because the usual Portuguese place I go to was closed. We ordered food for 20. Salad was good, nice and fresh . Chicken, potatoes and rice were ok. Nothing was over the top tasty just moderately good, I think the chicken was a tad dry. Customer service was great over the phone. I would try them again another time."}
{"text":"Prices are very good but the taste isn't great. I ordered the rotisserie chicken with potatoes and rice based on the previous reviews since I usually have amazing Portuguese food in Mississauga and didn't know where to go in Brampton and also because I generally love Portuguese food, the chicken was gamey, the meat wasn't tender at all, there was also a distinct smell coming from the chicken once i bit into it. Oddly enough the chicken skin was sticky like Elmer's glue. It was as if they had frozen that chicken for ages before cooking it... I'm guessing that's what it is since I've always been used to falling-of-the-bone rotisserie chicken that tastes fresh and tender with the perfect chicken skin. I wasn't a fan of the potato balls and the rice tasted a bit stale and plasticy. I'm quite sad that this place didn't live up to my standards, I guess I'll drive all the way to my usual mississauga Portuguese eatery."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for years as is really close to my workplace. It is located on the corner of Clarence and Kennedy in the plaza. 

I still remember their old location as they only had a counter space to eat in as it was a very small place. Their new location, just across the road, is a nice place. They now have a dining area but I believe their business is still mainly takeout. 

In terms of the quality of the food, I'll describe it as average. It's not the best Portuguese chicken you'll ever have but the price is right. They have the quarter chicken special and 2 sides on Tuesday to Thursday for $7 with a drink. That's a great value. You can choose from rotisserie or barbecue and white and dark meat. The spicy sauce is not really spicy. The best side dish is the potato with the rice and steamed vegetables forgettable. 

The location is really convenient for me so on days that I don't bring lunch, this place does the job. 

For everyone else, there are better Portuguese chicken places...

{"text":"Located in a small neighbourhood plaza. Rotisserie Chicken, potatoes and rice are very good. Veggies are frozen. Housemade Hot sauce is amazing but they only give you one small container, have to pay for more. Before Christmas 2015 they had a Quarter Chicken special which came with a canned pop for $5. You'd be hard pressed to find a better deal. I still come here but the special is just a free pop with the quarter chicken meal @ $6.99, that's still a good deal!"}
{"text":"The price to quality ratio here is very favorable. That is to say, you get very good food, lots of it, for a very reasonable price.

They have many Portuguese favorites including rotisserie chicken, breaded fish, rice, potatoes, soup, salad, etc. All very fresh, all very authentic.

You can feed a small army here for very little money. Last week we got lunch for 8 people for under $60. Two chickens, four pieces of fish, large potatoes, large rice, salad, and bread.

If you want to try something new, delicious, and inexpensive, check this place out.

And don't let the crummy little plaza it's in dissuade you. It's very nice inside. Very clean (they're Portugese afterall and cleaning is like cocain for those people)."}
{"text":"Ordered a small catering order, 6 whole chickens, and small party trays of potatoes and rice. In total came to $125. Seemed like a good deal as it easily fed more than 20 people. Overall, the food tasted good. A bit salty for my taste. I love their hot sauce, it burns all the way down. 

Customer service was friendly and their interaction with their regulars was very pleasant. My complaint would be the location, a strangely busy corner. No sign for restaurant location in plaza. I had to circle a few times to figure it out."}
