{"text":"Food was good, but what pissed me off was that the waitress thought it was cute to charge us $4.39 for a cup of milk for my baby daughter.  I could of bought a gallon of milk with that since the other drinks were $ 2.00"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here because there are literally no options in Terminal C at the airport. The food here is absolute garbage. I ordered the mozzarella appetizer which literally tasted like nothing.  I'm really curious as to how they achieved this. How can food taste like nothing? My husband got a bleu cheese burger and said essentially the same thing. There are no options so all I can say is good luck if you come here."}
{"text":"Right next to my gate in the Trudeau airport.  It is located in the International Departures/America area.

Being lunch time I decided on a smoked meat sandwich and a Rikards Red.  The sandwich was quite good, especially for airport fare.  The beer was of course good.  It has a diner look to the place with odd guitars on the wall and multiple tvs tuned to sports and news.

Easy place to grab some grub before a flight."}
{"text":"En Scene is in the Montreal - Trudeau airport, past the customs of the International concourse, but before you walk toward the gates.

Being in Montreal, I was expecting breakfast to be more continental, like in western Europe with toast, danish, thin slices of meats, espresso, some cheese and fruit. 

But here at En Scene, they served a great North American/English influenced country style breakfast, except with that great French Pan, the large thick slices of French White bread. 

My order (all figures in $CAD):

1 Cafe                      $1.79 
1 Jus D'orange      $3.99
2 Oeufs (Brouille)
Roties Blanc
Jambon                   $6.49

So a great hot breakfast of 2 eggs, ham and that great thick bread with little servings of peanut  butter and jam (it's Quebec!) for $6.49! 

Look out Denny's!"}
