{"text":"this is like one of those places on diners drive ins and dives. I don't eat meat but hear their souvalki and Burgers are awesome. I usually get their Greek salad which is fresh and tasty . My brother won't go anymore because he claims the cook was taking his paper money and then eating out of his fries without permission or washing his hands   EDIT: went the other day and had an irritating experience. The man who took our orders who I assume was the owner was so unbelievably pushy. He berated my coworkers into sharing a large souvaliki platter when all they wanted was small salads and a single skewer Each.I just wanted fries today and He kept asking why a person would come restaurant and only order fries......um cuz dude you own a Sh*tty Greek burger spot not a Michelin star Parisian bistro.   He insisted on making me a burger even going to the grill to put on the meat  I said no I don't eat meat and he continued to say how stupid that was and kept staring at me and listening to my coworkers conversation,  interrupting us to say how selfish I was haha.  He then went on about how I should get a Greek salad. I told him that since his hole in the wall only takes cash I didn't have enough on me for a 9$ salad and left. Will never be back even if the Greek salad is good.  Ps your fries were awful the grease they were fried in had clearly been used for days"}
{"text":"I grew up eating Harry's and it was always good. Now with the new management it is absolute crap. It is dirty inside, and you have to wonder if they clean their cooking utensils. The food is greasy and never cooked properly. You ask for well done fries and they are complete mush. They are running this restaurant into the ground.   If you enjoyed Harry's over a year ago, try Kathy's grill not to far from Harry's. It's what Harry's used to be"}
{"text":"This place is a Scarborough burger, souvlaki & onion ring institution!!  I was introduced to Harry's by some loyal, long-time neighbourhood boys who have been going here since their years in the playground.  It probably looks almost exactly as it looked 25 years ago (maybe even longer!)  The charm about this place is that it is OLD SKOOL and it will stay this way forever.  Everyone that enters the doors have all known one another for years.  And Peter, the dude that runs the grill, remembers every regular, and their orders.  You can't find this kind of service anywhere these days, but it certainly still exists at Harry's!  But let me tell you about the food... which is the real reason I've come back year after year.  The onion rings are incomparable... everyone must try these at least once before they die.  The breading is thick and so are the onion slices.  I looove their souvlaki on a bun, or shish kebab dinner. Whenever you order their souvlaki or fries, get it with a few splashes of lemon sauce on top!!!   I'm giving it four stars because as a drive through, there aren't many places to sit, especially in the winter months.  It's also not the most healthiest something I eat on a regular basis. I don't even want to know how many calories are in one of those fried onion rings... drool... !"}
{"text":"For all the \"gourmet\" burger establishments that have cropped up over the years, Harry's stands the test of time. Mind you, the burgers here would not be considered gourmet by so-called burger aficionados, but put any $12 blinged out burger in the ring with Harry's flagship homeburger ($6) and the bling will get knocked the eff out. Every. Single. Time.  Harry's homeburgers go back to the fundamentals of burgery goodness: one well-seasoned homemade beef patty charbroiled on the grill, loads of fresh veg toppings and your standard condiments of ketchup, mustard, relish and mayo. No caramelized this or funky cheese that. Think of this of the grassroots burger that reminds you why you fell in love with burgers in the first place.   Oh, and the homefries and gravy. I lived on these when I was in high school. Lunch cravings or post-volleyball practice hunger pains were satisfied by sprinting across Lawrence Ave. for a $2 plus tax box of freshly cooked, thick-cut homefries and thick gravy. I still think about those fries to this day and if ever I get an unrelenting craving for real fries, I'll make that trip out to Harry's for a box.   It doesn't get better than Harry's homeburgers and homefries."}
{"text":"Great family owned place! I've been coming here since 2001 and the food hasn't changed at all. The family who owns the place love what they do and always greet us when my family and I walk in.   When your here make sure you try their Greek fries! It's a \"Greek twist\" to the traditional poutine. It's something that your going to be coming back for! Other than that, their chicken/pork dinners are excellent and also very filling.   This place has been up and running successfully for so long just by word of mouth. Not many reviews on yelp but every time I come here the place is almost full of customers!"}
{"text":"Exactly as advertised. I get the feeling that this is an honestly run family business. Nothing fancy, just straight ahead good food and friendly service. I had the banquet burger (homeburger with cheese and bacon), fries (I like them plain), and a strawberry shake. I'm leaving satisfied. Thank you to the good Yelpers for recommending this place. I wouldn't have found this little gem without you. Cheers,"}
{"text":"Great sluvaki, delicious onion rings (order mine extra crispy) and a good burger. My favourite go to burger joint."}
{"text":"food was good...it just need a little renovation the store itself to look more inviting and nice.."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY so be prepared. Huge burgers, better than Harvey's and the prices are cheap. Burger is seasoned, well cooked and on a large, fresh bun. Onion rings are amazing, if you are on the fence about getting them, just do it! You won't regret ordering the onion rings. The poutine is massive, easily shared by 2 very hungry people or 3 people. They use cheddar, which is not my favourite but the gravy is good and covers most of the cheddar flavour. The prices cannot be beat, 2 burgers, 1 order of onion rings, 1 order of poutine was under $20. It's not a place to sit and eat, there isn't much room and it's busy, so take out is best. No one was rude to us or tried to tell us what to order, so I'm not sure what those few reviews are about. It's definitely worth trying and much better than Harvey's and way less expensive than the boutique burger joints that are popping up in Toronto."}
{"text":"When I work late nights at work, I'll drop by Harry's.  I'm unsure of their hours, but I usually reach here around 9:30ish and they are still open.  Super cheap burgers, with one of the best poutines I've ever had! And the poutine is in a huge take out box, it's enough for 2 or 3 people! Totally worth the money!  Cash only.  A must try!"}
{"text":"I used to go to Harry's for the homemade burger. The service was great and the food was excellent.   Now, the service is unfriendly and the food quality has deminished. The faces behind the counter were different. I wont be going back again."}
{"text":"My friend took me here yesterday, my first time. All I can say is good tasty food at a great price. The burger was solid, not the best I've ever had but very enjoyable, same with the greek salad, and I like how they have fresh salads here. A lot of burger places are strictly fries and onion rings for sides, and im trying to keep those out of my diet.  I can't wait to go back and try a souvlaki dinner or gyros and a strawberry shake.   The place has a nice cozy neighborhood feel to it as well."}
{"text":"We love this place!  This burger is in my top 5, it's just a good old fashioned burger joint where you're not paying fine dining prices for a burger and fries.  The homemade burger is a thin well seasoned 8 ounce patty on a perfectly soft bun that I overload with hot peppers, mustard and ketchup.   And its only like $4.50 with tax!  Definitely go in and grab a homemade with fries if you ever find yourself in the slums of scarborough.  p.s. grab the purple drank while you're there."}
{"text":"Was a Friday night hang out when I lived in Scarborough, I loved the fries and Garvey and a banquet burger."}
{"text":"With all the Big Chains and weird restaurants in the hood it's a constant \"greasy spoon\" that you can depend on. Fish & Chips, Burgers and Steak Sandwich & Greek salad with lots of Feta.  When I get a craving for some good Ol' you just roll up order and be ready to pay CASH ONLY. It's best as take out, it's not an eat in restaurant although there are stools and during warm weather your best bet is the outside tables. I hope it never goes away. The price is cheap, food is fast. and plentiful &  Its not formal or fancy...so you picky eaters should stay away, it is what it is. Deal with it, i know I will :)."}
{"text":"Good food, good value. If you want a decent cheap burger, Harry Drive in is the place but there are a few around like that (Johnny,Retro Burger).   It's nothing special. The patties are pretty thin but the double burger isn't expensive and usually solve the issue with wanting more meat.  It's not my favourite place but it still a good burger"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get affordable, home style grub.  I ordered the 7-ounce burger, which was wide and on the flat side.  The burger bread was just the right size for the burger.  You can use two hands to hold the burger.  All this for $4.40 plus tax.  I also ordered the poutine, which isn't presented the traditional way, nonetheless, it was tasty and satisfying.  The poutine was made out of shredded cheddar cheese, gravy and pre-cut fries.  For the quantity provided, it was a great steal.  This burger joint has a patio, which is great for casual summer dining.  Nothing fancy here, just good food at affordable prices!"}
{"text":"The grill cook this time around was ironically named \"Johnny\" like what most other Burger Joints are named after, however this place is called Harry's Drive-in where it's one of the tiny places with barstool counter seating and on a nice day there are 4 outdoor tables in the front.  I parked my car beside a few Light-sized Trucks as I followed a few rugged men inside this small place to order their Combo(Burger, Fries & Drink, $5.95) which is reasonable value for a grilled burger patty that didn't have as much frozen taste as other places.  As for the Bun? I think the photo will give you a good indication.   Fries are A-OK also and what is different is that your beverage comes in Can form instead of Fountain drink.  The elder women that took care of the orders and condiments and the elder men that had the cooking duties made this place feel of Mom & Pop."}
{"text":"I ordered Chicken Filet with Greek salad.  They give you a lot on the Greek salad.  Delicious!  The chicken was good but I wished it was juicier.  Overall this is an excellent place for Burgers, Souvlaki, Greek salad, etc.  Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"Cheap but very bland-tasting burgers..  The woman at the cash looked really miserable today.   Service was quick, food is prepared quickly.  The bun is huuuge compared to the patty. When I bit into the burger I found it pretty tasteless.  Should've just had Harvey's next door.  Not coming back here.. Next!!   Review 47 of 100"}
{"text":"Fries and gravy were fantastic! Had the fresh made homeburger and it was very good. It was a large patty and not too thick, cooked just right. At $4.50 that's a pretty hard deal to beat. Service was great, was greeted on the way in and thanked on the way out. They have a counter with stools inside and a few tables outside. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very fast and friendly service.  The restaurant was very clean with a cool Retro look and feel. The food was amazing! had the hamburger with fries, onion rings and a shake. Would do back again the next time I want a burger."}
{"text":"Decent stuff, no complaints but nothing to make it stand out.  If you ate looking at this while trying to pick between this and Harvey's though pick this place.    More for takeout though, almost no seating."}
{"text":"Was planning to re-visit The Fuzz Box. Got there by 6:30, and turns out it was already closed. Ended up going to this burger place that I learned here. Welcomed by the lady at the cashier, nice and friendly. Same with the other one cooking at the back. Ordered the 7oz home burger. Tasted ok....nothing special about it. Got the poutine too. The gravy is good, but they used cheddar cheese instead. Total comes up to $10.10......fair. Repeat?.....unless Johnny's and The Real Macory were both closed.  PS. while waiting....I realized that the Pizza Nova restaurant is still there. The last time I was there is maybe the early 90's.....wow."}
{"text":"You rarely see a small family owned restaurant last as long as this one. Harry's opened in 1964. For that alone they get a five star rating from me.  Every so often, I get a craving for onion rings and nobody does onion rings better than Harry's. The batter is crispy and the onions are cut thick. They are consistently good.  But their burgers, souvlaki, and steak on a bun are great too. Just good old fashioned standbys that everyone loves at a price you can't beat. I guess that's how they've stood the test of time. When you have a good thing, you don't mess with it! Oh btw, just to add to their old-school charm, they accept cash only. I hope Harry's Drive In stays exactly the same for many years to come!"}
{"text":"Good value and good food.  Buns are good but patties are pretty thin...still, way better than the place next door."}
{"text":"Tasty! Foods good! Fast! Nothing fancy just a old school place that has good food at great prices!"}
{"text":"s'aight for a old school burger joint. Better than it looks actually. Was not a fan of the from frozen store bought fries, but otherwise decent little place."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today, after years of passing by it on my way to work. I had read a few good things about it on Google Maps and thought I'd give it a try.   I decided to try the homemade burger combo which came out to be $10.10 which I thought was okkkk considering that kind of the price you'd be getting a fast food chain burger place anyways. In the combo, you get a large burger, a good amount of fries and a can of pop. After seeing how massive this burger was, I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was too. I really liked that is was a thick charbroiled burger patty, and it definitely showed in the taste.   PROS:  - family run local burger joint with old school charm  - Friendly and fast service  - The homemade burger is huge! It's hard to finish  - They fries was fresh and they don't put any salt, pepper or any toppings to accommodate the customer which I thought was a nice touch. They have the salt, pepper and vinegars off to the side to add yourself.    CONS:  - The pricing for the combo doesn't offer any discount If you add up the prices of each item individually, it comes out to be the exact same as if in a combo. - It might've been just today, but I could definitely tell they use the same fryer for battered fish as they do for the fries because the flavour definitely came through on the fries  - The burger bun was a tad bit stale, it was cracking all over the place, but that might have to do with the fact that all the doors were open for ventilation.   Overall, I had a pretty good experience and I'll probably come back in a little while for that homemade burger."}
{"text":"Fantastic banquet burger. Love the family run joints and love to support them. Would've loved some fresh cut fries to accompany the burger, they were a little plain, but poutine seems to be the fan favourite. The shake was a little watery, but the burger makes up for it all. Price isn't too bad ethier. Overall, I'd run in for another burger agony someday."}
{"text":"This place is so small but it's busy which I think is great for a family run business! The portions are huge! I ordered a chicken Greek salad and there was enough for two meals. My husband ordered fish and chips. The fish was large despite only being one piece and there were a tonne of fries. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Best take out souvlaki dinner around. We travel all the way from Bowmanville, Ontario to go here!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and absolutely love their banquet burger and fries with gravy. They only reason they do not get a perfect score in my option is the fact that they do not take debit. Most ppl do not carry cash anymore and is a real pain going to a bank to pull out some cash and incur service charges just for a burger. They really need to upgrade to debit. If I am in the area I will usually just go to Harvey's if I don't have cash on me witch is a shame because Harry's really does have the better burger."}
{"text":"I grew up down the street from Harry's, and 33 years later they still have the best tasting flame grilled burger in the city. The buns hold up well, and they always pack on the toppings. There's nothing quite like a burger from Harry's."}
{"text":"Never disappoints. Fresh, fast & reasonably priced. But it is what it is; a burger joint. Don't expect highbrow"}
{"text":"We go there for the large fries with gravy, poutine (uses shredded cheddar), fish n chips, soulvaki n Greek salad, gyro on a pita. Hamburgers remind me of Johnny's hamburgers, so might not be for everyone. Great service. Not a lot of seating inside but there are a few stone tables with benches in their outside patio area. Great for a quick meal or snack after work."}
{"text":"Used to be a five star joint. New management must've taken over because the place is ruined. Burger patties are super thin, bun is too big...gravey has been watered down...there's also one tall lady there who always messes up the orders and is super rude. Too bad. This used to be my favourite place. Now it's been added to my boycott list."}
