{"text":"First things first.. These burgers are ginormous!! And the size goes hand in hand with the taste. It's actually the best burger I've ever eaten. 

The patty is very large, hand made and cooked on a grill. The toppings are always fresh, the buns are large and fluffy and the SAUCE.. don't get me started, the sauce is a hand crafted mixture from the burger gods sent down to earth to give us a little taste of heaven! They have delicious fries, crispy on the outside soft on the inside. I believe it's priced accordingly to portion, quality and flavour. 

The restaurant is located very conveniently at Warden and Lawrence. They're open pretty late from what I remember. 

Talking about Yummi's burgers makes me want to go back and have another one right now."}
{"text":"Omfg this was the best swarma combo I've ever had .Even the fries are great .Couldn't eat it all"}
{"text":"Awesome place for burgers and all.. the king / queen burger sizes mean business. They easily compete with some of the best burgers in town. Fresh meat not frozen for months. You can tell when you taste it. The sauces they have are amazing! It's a small place so better to take out unless lunch or snacking. Love the fries!! They top them off with a sauce and ketchup if you want and that makes them even better! Best place to come and munch out. If you go to big Moe's all the time and Ibrahim's then this is worth trying!!"}
{"text":"A great place for a quick bite. Good size burgers which are fresh. Liked the crispy fries. Friendly service. Good size portion. Check it out."}
{"text":"The owner is a complete scumbag who tries to engage in \"meaningful\" conversation but only comes off disingenuous and is only out to make an extra few bucks off customers. Different prices every time and the shawarma is as inauthentic as you can get. If you can't make it right, don't make it at all. Avoid this place like the plague"}
{"text":"A co-worker introduced me to Yummi's Burger recently. Four of us stopped in at lunch time. I had the King Burger with extra sauce (my friends raved about the sauce) with fries and it was fantastic! The burger was HUGE and I had to take half of it to-go. I saw a lot of people coming and going for their fries because, yes, just their fries are that good. The place is a bit small but clean and staff are SO nice. This place definitely lived up to the hype for me!

Crazy good- making my mouth water right now."}
{"text":"This place probably has the worst customer service. The owner is a complete d-bag, and puts himself on a pedestal for no reason. He has to understand he is behind the counter and we are the customers. Don't run a business if you do not understand that. I am not the only one to complain about this d-bag. Today an elderly lady just walked out, because she could not believe the filth coming out of the d-bags mouth. Please, i hope more people write about this place and put this d-bag out !"}
{"text":"2 for $10 shawarma. Charged $12.50. He overcharged the person before me as well. Also randomly gave me a hot pepper and than asked me if I wanted to buy a drink."}
{"text":"One of the best Halal beef burgers in the GTA!

Casual spot. We each ordered the \"king\" size burger combos with fries and pop, total came to $30 and we were stuffed because the patties are massive. I'll order the queen size next time...maybe.

The patties are made of fresh ground beef that the owner started cooking after we ordered. Toppings were fresh - I got onions, garlic sauce, tomato and parsley on mine.

Owner was friendly - did not experience the pushiness/paying upfront issue another reviewer mentioned."}
{"text":"Best halal burgers, the owner is super nice and welcoming and they make sure you get the toppings you want on the burgers. Their shawarma and other sandwiches are delectable as well and the fries on the side always compliment everything on the menu, the way they prepare it is so so yummy. I've come here multiple times and I don't get tired of it. They also have generous portions which is great if you're really hungry and want some delicious food. You know how they talk about hungry being a feeling well this place satisfies that feeling of hunger."}
{"text":"The king burger is the best burger I've ever had , the combination of the garlic sauce and the meat makes it incredibly tasty. The owner was very nice and friendly. the price might come a little much how it's 15$ for a king burger but 10/10 would go there again"}
{"text":"This place makes its shawarma a little different and it gives for a whole new shawarma experience. It's really tasty and the staff is nice and always in a good mood. We have become regular customers here."}
{"text":"Owner is pushy, made me pay for my food first before he even made it. I questioned him about this to get the reply \"this is fast service you pay first and I make it for you\"...mmmmm pretty questionable.  Also red flag there was no one in there when I went so he shouldn't need to speed up my service. So they do a pocket shawarma not a wrap. Misleading since the banner on the front advertising 2 for 10 shawarma is wrap and not a pocket. He mixed my fillings before he put into the pocket and didn't layer the fillings. There was no hummus, garlic or tahini which was weird. The taste of the shawarma wasn't bad, but I've had better. The restaurant it's self is clean and good size if you want to sit and eat. But if that day Shawarma Empire's crap parking lot down the road was not full I would have paid less and got a much tastier Shawarma."}
