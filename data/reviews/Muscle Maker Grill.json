{"text":"Who puts onions in your burger meat?! Especially when you ask for no onions on your burger. There is no famous burger joint that I know of that implements an ingredient that is the most requested to be taken off and wins any type of taste test. Far as I'm concerned the meat is probably bad and they are using it to mask the pungent taste. Well it didn't work, it's still horrible and ruined my dining experience.  I understand this isn't a place known for its burgers but if you're going to put it on the menu.  .  .  Last time I had the chicken wrap, it was nothing to write home about either."}
{"text":"Great tasting food and served at the right portions. Not the jumbo over eat size and I highly recomend this place. I had the Santa Fe Wrap and it was perfect."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, the customer service was awesome. Fast and friendly service with clean environment. I had the chicken Caesar wrap and my husband had the steak signature wrap. The food was delicious.. my husband finished mine because I was to full to finish it..highly recommend for fast and healthy."}
{"text":"I think the concept is great but they have some things to work on with owning a business.  Most of the time their phones go to a voice mail that say \"mailbox is full\" and it's pretty hectic when you go into the place. There is a lady (who I think is the owner or a manager) and she talks down to the staff. It's sad and I would hate to work there! For the most part, I do like the food and smoothies, although sometimes the meats are old and burnt. It's a hit or miss place."}
{"text":"They were over priced for what you got very disorganized ordered vegetarian wrap and got a chicken wrap they fixed it 15 min later was very bland would not recommend"}
{"text":"Love this place. Everything is made fresh and you can order a weeks worth of food and pick it up daily made fresh daily. Good healthy food."}
{"text":"Our ladies group went to this restaurant yesterday for the first time.  Thought after all of the holiday eating this would be a healthy choice.  The food was delicious, low calorie, reasonably priced, and healthy.  I had my dish prepared specially the way I like it.  Every dish has its calorie count on the menu, my dish was huge and was only 400 calories.  If you are in a hurry call ahead and your order will be waiting for you.  Great experience we will be back."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and it never arrived after waiting an hour and a half. Tried to call the store to check the status of my order and they didn't pick up the phone."}
{"text":"Love their food! Healthy and fast and very friendly people here. I always get the hamburger and its up there with anything I've tried and its healthy. So, give them a try!"}
{"text":"Horrible frozen, pre-packaged food. Will NEVER go there again. Just because its heated up in a microwave doesn't define it as \"freshly made\"."}
{"text":"A wonderful place to enjoy the best homemade  meal ever. I ordered the penned pasta with vodka  sauce and chicken. Delicious.  Very generous  helping.  Also has a cup of potato with bacon soup. Just like my grandmother used to make. Absolutely delicious. Would highly recommend this restaurant. I definitely will be returning quite often"}
{"text":"So Im not sure what these other people are complaining about \" they don't have free water \" Really that's what you complain about wow what a cheepskate. This is why yelp sucks for reviews they post crap like this then hide good reviews that are real. I've been here several times very pleased they remembered my name from the second time I was in. There's not many places that have people that care anymore.. I've been in customer service for 16 years so it's nice to see there are still some good places around.. For what you get I don't think there that pricey you won't find healthy food many places cheap especially food that's made for you . I have had the Santa fe wrap as well as the cajun pasta and the tex mex wrap like them all have to say it's a split between the wraps for the best. Bottom line super happy to finally have a healthy semifast food place. I am always on the run so this makes healthier eating soo much easier. This will be a regular stop for me.."}
{"text":"Went in only because another eatery was packed, and happy it was this place was delicious! The dining area was warm and seemed dark, but the service and food was great!"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited about this place opening up in AZ having had it for every day for two weeks in Jersey, but I was very disappointed about the quality and pricing of my order...the \"Arizona\" with steak which cost $9.99 + $2.00 for the steak. It came with of brown rice with tomato and green onions. I normally wouldn't waste my time doing reviews like this, but this was far different from what I had back in Jersey. The protein (steak) reminded me of tiny steak left overs from your steak burrito from a local Filibertos, but far less in amount...meaning I essentially paid for brown rice, tomatoes and green onions for $9.99. The same dish in Jersey was chunky steak that equalled the proportion of your rice not 1/10 steak and 9/10 rice/tomato/green onions. If you want real steak and chicken with rice Greek Wraps on 75th Ave and Bell Rd will satisfy your craving and well worth the $10 you will spend."}
{"text":"man people love to bitch about nothing (other reviews)...  Just the fact that there is something other than french fries as a side is awesome... I had the bbq wrap, potato and brocolli... all of it was very good..."}
{"text":"When a place advertises as a healthy restaurant and yet the cashier is sipping on a QT soda cup it tells you something.  When the owner or manager is to busy scolding employees about how the Vitamin Water is displayed rather than greet customers it tells you something.  $3 for a snack size bag of pop chips tells you something.  Over priced and tasteless food.  When the cashier wonders why your kid just didn't get chicken mcnuggets it tells you something.  Great concept, poor and overpriced execution in my opinion."}
{"text":"This  place is by my gym and I worked hard so I figured why not. I had a small mango smoothie with strawberry protein for $7.  The price was a bit much but the protein did not tast chalky or grainy. I would come again."}
{"text":"Despite the poor reviews, I really love MMG. I work for American Eagle's Corporate office and so this is one of the places in walking distance to my office. It's a couple more bucks than Subway but the chicken is grilled right in front of you and that to me is worth it. It just seems healthier. 

Granted, I only get the European wrap (grilled chicken/red peppers/spinach/and parmesan) but I am always satisfied. I also get the cucumber salad on the side that has chopped onions and dressing over it. 

I know exactly what people are talking about with that weird wet/sogginess. Sometimes the juice from my chicken settles at the bottom of the container but I just make sure to throw some napkins down. The portion size is pretty small but for me, it's perfect.  

There's not much to the place - It seems like it just opened but apparently they've been there for a while. There's a lot of empty space. No tables just a bar against the wall running the length of the grill.

I have definitely recommended this place to people - It's good to throw in the mix. I wouldn't get it for dinner but it's perfect for a lunch or a post gym meal if you're willing to pay $10 for a hardy snack."}
{"text":"I work relatively close to MMG, so I've given it a few chances. 
No more.
MMG is WAY too expensive for what you get, and what you get is inconsistency,  salt, a weird wetness and mush.
Turkey meatballs: salt.
Cucumber salad: salt and mush
Pasta with marinara: salt, mush, and wetness.
\"Premium\" burger: see picture. Seriously.  It's awful.
Rocky Balboa wrap: wet, mush and salt. 
Rice and beans: wet, salt, mush.
Pizza: salt. SALT SALT SALT SALTY SALT.

Order any of these a second time and you will get a completely different item from what you got the first time. 
Which might be a good thing.

When dining in at MMG, you will have the pleasure of listening to the cook sigh and huff his way thru screwing up your salty wet pile of mush while waiting at least 20 minutes. DO NOT LET HIM KNOW YOUR ORDER IS WRONG. It will take an additional 20 minutes to fix AND you get stink eye the whole time you have to wait. It's not worth it anyway, as you get a salty, wet, mushy pile of slop regardless. 
It's like paying for dinner and a show. But with lots of salt. And mush. And wet."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Fresh and delicious..on the go or in a hurry, they have customized orders just for me and my lifestyle goals. Friendly staff.. attentive. Clean and hip atmosphere. Amazing wraps and the smothies are awesome!"}
{"text":"First time coming to this spot. The food was pretty good, but also pretty over priced. Total cost for one pasta dish with chicken and a protein shake...nearly $20. I've made better tasting shakes at home. If you have the money, the meal plan option is an interesting concept for a restaurant to offer. It will also set you back about $150 a week or more depending on how much food you want. Overall, it was a good place to try once."}
{"text":"Had the balboa wrap with steamed broccoli. It was great!!
Highly recommend and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I can't speak to the service because my husband brought me this home, but the food is really meh.  I had a southwest inspired salad with chicken and the meat was dry and over seasoned.  The salsa dressing was canned green chilis and maybe some vinegar or something.  It was not a great combo.  I still have half of it in the fridge and will most likely not be returning to it.  I even tried to bring it more to life by adding some cheese, brown rice, corn and sour cream and it was still just not good because of the dry, over seasoned chicken and not very good dresing.  If I had a lime I would have added some lime juice to tone down the bitter in the chicken seasoning.  I don't think I will return to this place."}
{"text":"Went there earlier called in an order to pick up the lady who picked up sounded like it was such a bother to take my order. Came in to pick up the food which came with drinks asked for a chocolate peanut butter shake and it tasted like water. But since the cashier was giving me attitude the moment I walked in I didn't bother complain threw the shake away the moment I walked out of the place (I'm sure it was the same girl who took my order over the phone). Guess she didn't want to be there or something. Food was mediocre at best. Service was terrible."}
{"text":"The service was out of this world. They were exceptionally nice, well presented, courteous and extremely customer focused. The restaurant was clean, brightly lit and accommodating, but that's where it ends. The food was less than microwave meal quality at best. I won't be back, which is unfortunate. You can't find such great service many other places."}
{"text":"Food was OK. Nothing special. Its tastes like frozen food. I had the chicken breast over veggies, and my son had a southwest wrap. I think the best part was the sauces they use. The smoothie is just some concentrated mix, no real fruit. Not my cup o tea. This is a family ran joint. Which is fine, but how I found out it was family owned and operated was not fine. Scene- Husband and wife arguing about daily duties and how they cant keep doing \"this\" every day. Along with the wife grilling (no pun intended) her daughter about letting the dog out, homework and so on. I wasn't eves dropping, they were standing 10 feet away from my table. It was hard not to hear. Leave that stuff at home. Nobody wants to hear it."}
{"text":"BBQ chicken wrap w a side of broccoli! Fresh food that tastes good aaaand is good for you. Love this place"}
{"text":"Came in with a groupon but will definitely return. I got the mmg wrap with steak with a side cucumber salad and chocolate pb protein shake. My boyfriend got the Santa fe wrap with side Caesar salad and a berry smoothie. The wait was very short but everything was great, perfect portions, the food tastes fresh. Real meat and real veggies! It's nice to have a healthier option to \"fast food\". The service was spot on, everyone was very nice (and didn't get annoyed by my indecisiveness lol) many great options. Will return to try more!!"}
{"text":"I am always looking for a new place for some tasty and healthy eats.  I work out at the Southside LA Fitness and I decided to pick up lunch before meeting some friends nearby.  Upon entrance - I wasn't sure if this place was open or not - no one there and no one at the counter.  The workers were in there but just hanging and watching TV.  It doesn't seem like they get a lot of business.  After I ordered I took a moment to take in the surroundings,  My overall impression was that the place was pretty dirty - which was surprising since no one was in there.  I was glad that I was not dining in.  I was nervous to look behind the counter - so I didn't.  

I ordered the MMG Signature Wrap with Chicken with a cucumber salad with balsamic dressing.  The food was decently prepared - but for 10$ for a wrap and a side with no drink I am not sure that it is good enough to bring me back when there are a lot of other healthy eating choices close by."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday when they opened. I walked in and felt like I just walked into a fire pit. It was so hot, that cashier said the AC unit was down and it was 96 degrees! So, my food was now 'to go'. Service was nice. Showed me the correct menu to look at. 

I got the GODFATHER - GS which is: Grilled chicken breast, portabella mushrooms, red roasted peppers, reduced fat mozzarella, gluten and fat-free balsamic vinaigrette over broccoli. Very delicious. You definitely get your monies worth. 3 huge pieces of chicken. It had such good taste even if it was gluten sensitive (GS). This serving size is a meal plan of its own. 

I will be coming back to try their smoothies and other meal options.  Give them a chance and don't let the heat stop you from ordering. Hopefully their AC unit is working :)"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to review muscle maker, especially after seeing all the unnecessary negativity towards it. A few weeks ago I had someone bring me takeout from here. I had the \"Godfather\" which is grilled chicken breast, portobello mushroom, red roasted peppers, reduced fat mozzarella, gluten free fat free balsamic and broccoli. I thought the dish was awesome. The chicken was cooked right and everything tasted great. I am giving it 4 stars because I did not physically eat there so I cannot speak on that. What I can tell you is the food was great and prepared in a way I would have prepared it at home, the healthy way! The people involved in this restaurant live healthy lifestyles and it clearly shows, why would they lie about the way the food was prepared? I would love to go back and physically eat in the restaurant. I will be sure to update my review when I do."}
{"text":"Tonight was the first night the hubby and I ate here and I have to say it was delicious!  I tried the Santa Fe  wrap.....which was amazing and hubs had the Rocky Balboa and he said it was just as good as mine. I'm so happy to see a healthy eatery that is close to my gym that also delivers AND they do meal prep! Perfect! The staff was extremely nice and helpful with any questions we had. We will definitely be back and I have a feeling I will be having them prep a few of my meals. 

If you want something quick and healthy, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great place! The food and staff is amazing! Scott has always been great when we go in."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times now and love it! 

The restaurant: small but clean. Nothing to complain about. Eating in, they serve you the food on real plates with real forks. No disposable nonsense. I like that they have the tv on with a football game. 

The food: I've tried several of the wraps and the cheesecake. I appreciate having a place to go to that has basically only healthy options. They try to allow you to make good choices with low carb tortillas and sides like veggies or salad. Even the cheesecake is NSA and therefore low carb. The food comes out fast and tastes fresh. 

The service: the owner went out of her way to deliver to my work once, which was appreciated. The only complaint was that my salad was in the side container next to my hot wrap, so the salad was warm. I didn't eat it. Dining in was better for the saad. Anyway, the service was friendly and fast. No complaints. 

No reason not to become a regular here, especially being located so close to home. And a groupon!"}
{"text":"I was super hungry when I left the gym, so please forgive my half eaten dish. This was REALLY good (Cajun Chicken Penne). They have good variety of healthier, high protein options, which is awesome because who always wants to cook a whole meal all the time...phshhh not me. Definitely will try this place over and over again. Prices are fair also."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Food is great, customer service is awesome, delivery, meal plans and catering you can not go wrong. I have been here or ordered from here 5 times now and have been impressed each and every time. Can't wait for my next visit. They even have phone charging stations use can use free of charge. Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Amazing chicken ceaser salad with warm fresh chicken, but unfortunately their protein shakes are absolutely horrible, and their cheese they use is cheap and feels like I'm chewing on a pier of melted rubber"}
{"text":"This will be a short review because we walked out before we even ordered. My husband and I were put off the second we walked in by how hot it was in there and a weird smell! There was a rack of t-shirts as you walk in the door and then a couple of cardboard boxes below it. Then, I see the Circle K looking cooler containing water bottles and such. It's such a small place and all the clutter as you walk in makes it even smaller. Then the menus are practically on the ceiling. The woman behind the counter was very friendly and grabbed some menus saying they're easier to read! If you know that, then change it! We went to find a seat to go over the menu and noticed a table in the back cluttered with papers and a computer, that was about it for me, so we left."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a new place with salads and healthy food in the area so I stopped in around 12:30 for lunch. It was packed and the kitchen was under a rush.

I ordered the nuggets kid's meal, Caesar wrap and Steak Fajita wrap. It was about $30 and took about 20 min for the order. The manager or owner said it usually takes 8-9 min. Anyway, when he went through the order for me, the nuggets had never been ordered so he threw them in for free.

The chef seems to really care about quality of what goes out and I saw him really get
On the staff to make sure things were right.

My chicken caesar wrap was meh. The chicken was burnt but the rest tasted fair enough. I also got a side of cucumber salad and was also disappointed with the sogginess.

My husband really enjoyed his steak fajita wrap, however, so who knows... 

He would go back but I'm not sure I would."}
{"text":"The owner was so rude and I watched him touch money and then make food without gloves or washing his hands ... disgusting"}
{"text":"Very nice staff! The wrap I ate was tight and yummy! Just enough dressing and no snapback from the chicken. The cucumber salad was tart and great. Will go back again. Close to work and quick!"}
{"text":"I was excited to find out there is a place around the area where I work that has healthy food.
I ordered the teriyaki chicken with brown rice today, but I unfortunately found it too salty.  Not too healthy for my blood pressure.  Please tone down on the salt or give the customers the option to add more salt or sauce. I will try the other items on the menu someday.  Hopefully, you can think also of the sodium content to make it really healthy.  Service was outstanding though."}
{"text":"The best for lunch on the go! We just moved here from NY and go hiking frequently- I'll call them for an  order to go- alway fast and yummy. We are looking into their weekly meal plans. Get the bbq chicken wrap or meatball in wrap. So damn good. We are macro counters- they have all the info online. Love it"}
{"text":"My hubby and I were looking around for a breakfast place to eat at and he pointed out this place right before we head out on the highway back to Cali. I was resigned to go to McDonalds for my egg fix and was intrigued to check this MuscleGrill out.

When we stood outside looking at the menu through the glass the owner came out excited that I had my Chicago Blackhawks hat on and stated that as a fan we must eat here. Cool, so we went in.

They didn't really have eggs in their menu but the owner offered to customize a burrito for me to include egg. I was thrilled. We each ordered our burritos and a smoothie and waited at a table. Our food came out first and it was fabulous and delicious. Wow. Yum.

However, it appeared the owner had to leave the line while the lunch rush happened after we sat down and the associates forgot our smoothies. I finished my meal and walked up and asked about them. The lady apologized and made our smoothies when she could. 

I give this place 4 stars for hospitality and being personable. It isn't 5 because my smoothie was not as good as I thought it would be... Like something vital was missing. 

I would go again though. Good place."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant through a Groupon. I showed up outside,  but I had my small dog with me. I understood that pets won't allowed,  and that was just fine. I had a wonderful surprise when a really nice lady came outside and let me know she would be happy to take my to-go order for me. Then after hearing my dog loves vegetables,  he got a special treat of some broccoli. Had a cold wrap to go with a side , and also a hot entree to go. Both of the meals were amazing and if the customer service on the outside of the restaurant is this good on the inside , I definitely will be back. Thank you for a great experience"}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome! We found this place by accident but thank God we did! We had the potato and bacon soup, it was homemade and delicious! We also had the penne pasta with vodka sauce and chicken and it was so good and everything is fresh and homemade! For dessert we tried one of their 100% fruit smoothies and of course it was delicious! Not to mention the service was wonderful and the owner was very accommodating! Needless to say I highly suggest eating here and it's good for you! You better believe we will be the eating here in the future!"}
{"text":"The place is nice and clean, the staff is very friendly, however the food is overpriced. Plus what kind of muscle maker restaurant don't offer free water. I hate dasani as its chemical loaded and I had opt for a Powerade which is loaded the same.... Bummer. They have a decent menu but honestly the best value for your money. Next time I'll take myself over to chipotle for a well priced bowl. If you're up for overpriced then go for it, the food is tasty. 

The burgers, wraps and the pastas are good choices I try not to come here that often unless I'm on the go and I can't find anything else that isn't packed."}
{"text":"Such a great place. Dieting hard right now and real limited with what I can eat so I went in to see Scott and have some dinner.

Turned out he knows my diet better than I do! He whipped me up some grilled chicken with steamed broccoli and spinach followed by a cucumber salad with red wine vinegar.

Delicious and nutritious so I can be lean amd vicious!

If you're looking to eat responsibly and still enjoy great tasting food, look no further than Muscle Maker Grill!"}
{"text":"Oh my god  so good!!! My favorite place to eat so fresh and tasty.  I want one in colorado. Signature wrap is awesome."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there because we had a Groupon. We ordered the barbecue chicken wrap and it was OK but nothing to write home about. It would've been better if they used regular cheese instead of the low-fat cheese. But I guess that's what they are all about... Healthy. I still have another Groupon to use but I'm going to stick to a salad next time.  Also they did not have fountain drinks, only drinks in bottles and you had to ask for a cup with ice."}
{"text":"Had the chocolate peanut butter shake ... it tastes WAY BETTER with almond milk instead of water. Has a much better consistency . Great for a quick post workout treat ."}
{"text":"I went to this Muscle Maker location. Everyone's raving about this place so I thought I tried. Unfortunately me and my friend's first impression were really..really bad!!!. I walked in and the first thing I noticed together with a few other customers was the place felt like a steam room. The front door was open, the a/c turned off and when I asked the cook and she said they turn off the A/C because they had to clean the grill area soon and this was at 7:30 when they didn't have to close until 8pm. Now I don't know if this is management policy but ...not cool ( if you will). I saw the lady cook that she was sweating really profusely because she was in front of this grill cooking while the A/C was turned off. Then there were the people who took my order...not even a greet...forget about the smile which did not happen. I am not throwing these people under the bus. But I'm thinking these workers weren't happy because of the condition in the joint."}
{"text":"Tonight was the first time that I have tried this place and I must say the food and service here is thee best. I had the mmg signature wrap and it was so delicious and so fulfilling. I've just recently started going to the gym to be a more healthier me and this place ALSO DELIVERS!!! This makes it so much easier to eat out or order in and not feel guilty about it."}
{"text":"I was in AZ for work and am a weight-watchers lifer. This place was awesome !! I could eat everything on the menu without worrying about hidden sauces. I got the turkey taco salad for lunch. I calculated 3pts on WW 

It was fresh and delicious . 

Great job muscle maker grill"}
{"text":"Their food is decent. A good alternative to fast food but their delivery time is awful! An hour is the average and they never answer the phone. Their inbox is always full and they don't pick up the phone any way. I'm not sure a the 20$ salad and chicken wrap is worth it."}
{"text":"So delicious and healthy both, good portions. Friendly and fast service. Can't wait to try something else."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for lunch. We are health conscience people so this was a nice find for us. I had the whole wheat penne pasta w/ chicken and spicy sauce. It was fantastic. My wife had a salad with chicken that she also really enjoyed. I must say, I was very impressed w/ the size of the portions and also the amount of chicken that the dishes came with. The prices were about right for a quality meal with good portion sizes. The establishment is clean and the girl that helped us at the cash register was very friendly. I would use them to cater and will return with our kids for some more healthy fresh food and a smoothie."}
{"text":"Ordered via UberEATS, my driver said his order kept getting pushed to the last. It took longer than expected.

I ordered 3 Chocolate Peanut Butter shakes for me and my coworkers, and you know that saying 'love after first sip' yeah, no. Wasn't the case. They were watery, powdery, chalky, we literally could make a better shake at home using protein shake powder.

I am glad I didn't order the 32 oz, then it would have been 32 oz of disappointment.

Based on the shakes, I do NOT recommend them."}
{"text":"Good location; healthy tasty food.  Two doors down From a GNC is a great location for a bodybuilder-inspired eatery. 

My turkey chili tasted great over brown rice; however, the portion size was extremely small and I left hungry (not something a bodybuilder wants l)"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a shopping center just off 101 on Thunderbird, is this hidden gem...

Great place for delicious fast food if you care about what you eat!  (Perfect for the average diet conscious person, vegetarian, South Beach \"aficionado,\" or the workout crowd.)  

Although portion sizes could be a little larger, the food is tasty, simple, lean and clean, and probably the healthiest fast food available. The smoothies are fantastic, made only with 100% fruit, and the best I've ever tasted. (Seriously, it's not easy to make a 100% fruit smoothie more delicious than the \"commercial\" smoothie chains with loads of sugar.) If you like Pina Colada, you'll love it here! And they also have protein shakes for those serious about \"muscle making,\" and of course, all the healthy \"add-ins\" (...more than you'd expect) are available.

I had one of their low carb wraps (which means it's on whole wheat), that was a great balance between being satisfyingly filling, yet light.  I liked their food so much, I ordered their weekly plan, which is surprisingly economical and delicious. (They have several plans, but basically you choose as many meals as you'd like from a wide assortment of choices, and they'll even deliver, if you live nearby.)  I chose 7 already prepared, fresh healthy dinners for $35. (Fresh and Healthy for $35 a week? I can't buy the groceries I'd need to make it for that!)  And the meals are packaged and delivered to stay fresh tasting and delicious! 

Seriously, this place is great, particularly if you don't want the expense of, or have the time or desire to, cook at home. It's a healthy, economical alternative you'll feel good about.  After all, we are what we eat!"}
{"text":"I love to eat in places that make healthy food delicious and try to change the preconceived notions that if something is good for you, it's going to taste like cardboard.  That said, this restaurant's ideals about healthy food and my own are a little different.  I don't believe in fat free, or cooking spray.  I try to eat as whole as possible with as little packaging as possible.  When I go out to eat, it is sometimes a splurge, but for the most part I still try to keep it relatively healthy.  I went here on a Friday night to get something for myself and my kids between pick up from school after work and a school function.  They have a small kids menu, and gluten free options, so I figured what the heck, why not?  My youngest daughter ordered a quesadilla from the kid's menu with a side of broccoli, my oldest daughter ordered pasta from the kid's menu with a side of savory spinach, and I ordered the Godfather with a side of savory spinach.  The broccoli was plain and could have stood to have some seasoning on it, but otherwise cooked alright.  The quesadilla was nothing special, my daughter ate it without comment on it being good or bad.  The pasta was alright according to my older daughter.

Savory spinach - this spinach seems to be \"steamed\" and then tossed with a white wine vinegar with jarred garlic.  Jarred garlic has a bitter taste from the potassium sorbate used as a preservative and it's not pleasant.  When asked how the food was, I tried to explain this.  I was told that fresh garlic would be difficult to use, so I offered the suggestion of a garlic press stored in a cup of water the way ice cream scoops are (to keep the garlic from drying on the press, making it difficult to clean later).  This was an altogether disgusting dish and pretty much the only way to get past it is to mix it with other food.  Steamed spinach was offered as a replacement, so we tried it, but I don't think they actually steam the spinach as the owner or manager said it was dunked into boiling water, which is really boiled spinach and not steamed.  It makes sense too since the spinach is so over done and soggy, it sits in a puddle of water.

The Godfather was quite tasty and hid the sins of the spinach rather well.  The chicken was a little salty, but when cut up and mixed with the rest of the food, it blended nicely with the flavors of the broccoli, sauce, peppers and mushrooms.

All of that said, this is a very expensive place.  2 bottles of Minute Maid apple juice will run you over $7, that is ridiculous (for a place that is about health food, I find it interesting that they sell this brand which most likely contains GMOs.)  With the food, I understand, you're paying for fresh food, but a bottle of Minute Maid for over $3?  That is some markup.

We might be back, but we'll bring our own water, and try something else.  I can only hope a second visit will be better."}
{"text":"Food was very bland and had little flavor.  The prices are high for the amount and quality received.  Don't waste your time here for a healthy meal.  It's overpriced food breaks the bank and isn't that healthy in general.  Also, food handling was very unsanitary.  No gloves on cooks!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to stop in since the menu revolves heavily around meat and I'm vegetarian. I tried the vegetarian wrap which is mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, low fat cheese and peppers in a herb wrap. It can be ordered regular or spicy. I ordered it spicy - without  peppers - spinach added. Was actually very good. Ingredients are cooked and the wrap was warm and soft. Was very surprised when she asked me what side I wanted. I picked their cucumber salad which is great: cucumbers, red onions and herbs with a vinagrette. Not sweet and syrupy like some. When I ordered a tea she showed me a posting on their counter - free with Facebook check in. Now that I know they DO have an acceptable veggie meal I'll be back. Staff was very interactive and nice. Only downside for some May be the noise level. Lots of conversations but it was busy and nearly full. Try!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Teriyaki Grilled Chicken Stirfry. First off, the sauce was NOT Teriyaki- it's just soy sauce and it's swimming in it. It's a salty mess. The menu says enough for two but it was an extremely small portion. I expected a nice mix of veggies and meat but t was mainly meat and a few soggy veggies I couldn't even find the portobello. I won't ever be coming back here. If I wanted to eat something this salty I'd drink ocean water."}
{"text":"I am doing a whole 30 (no grains, dairy, etc) and thought this would be a good place to get dinner that would fit in my diet. I ordered the chicken entree to go. It was grilled chicken, steamed broccoli, and came with a baked potato but I substituted a sweet potato. The chicken had fake looking grill marks on it and tasted sooooo bland and dry. The broccoli was fine, just steamed broccoli with nothing on it. The sweet potato was not actually a sweet potato. I watched the cook take the potato wedges out of the freezer and microwave them for two minutes. When I got home I doused everything in Frank's red hot. I don't know if i ordered the wrong thing or what, but I was not a fan."}
{"text":"I really like the idea of Muscle Maker Grill. They advertise healthy food. They have pastas, wraps, salads and entrées. They have choices of chicken, shrimp and beef  Each item on the menu has the calories listed, which I appreciate. I only gave 4 stars because I'd love for them to really embrace the healthy food. I had the Arizona. It has brown rice, but a healthier choice would be quinoa. It's not available. The Arizona I was served looked exactly like the photo which is always a plus!
They also serve fruit & veggie smoothies, shakes and coffee drinks.

I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Do not go here. I walked in for lunch and the guy at the front was on his cell phone the entire time he was taking my order and never said a word to me except how much my meal cost. Not tomention he barely spoke English. Also, they were out of jalapeño wraps. How can a place that specializes in wraps be out of them? Extremely rude and I will not be back."}
{"text":"Food was ok but when I found out all the soy they use made me mad because soy increase estrogen in men and the owners don't know anything about Nutrition just told us to get on the meal plan. Don't waste your time you can get better cool other places."}
{"text":"The food was really good and fresh, we really enjoyed it a lot. However our only complaint was the staff. They were all really friendly to us, but it was awkward because they were bickering and fighting with each other. They were also openly eating while preparing our food and kinda just standing around by the grill eating and fighting with each other. Prices were kinda high also."}
{"text":"I work nearby, and I keep seeing my coworkers with the distinctive red muscle maker containers at lunchtime. I finally tried it out today. It's a small shop run by friendly, personable people.  They have a varied selection of healthy menu options, with nutrition info and calorie counts clearly labeled on their big menu displays and printed flyers, so you can comparison-shop without having to do any research before you go.  Most of the items on the menu seem to fall between 400 and 800 calories. The black-and-red decor -- including walls painted solid matte-black with red accents -- has a slightly haunted-house/porn-theater/NASCAR  feel to it; I don't mind that at all, but I can see how it might feel off-putting or claustrophobic to some. Fight through it!

I had a Yee-ha wrap -- grilled chicken, turkey bacon, southwest potatoes, yummy spicy sauce. It was very good (actually much tastier than I expected it to be), and very filling -- I was full after finishing half the wrap and saved the rest for dinner.  I got a cucumber salad on the side. It was refreshing and a nice complement to the spicy wrap, but the vegetables were a little rubbery, making me think maybe it had been made yesterday.  

According to the menu, my wrap had about 680 calories. I thought it was at least as tasty as the Qdoba Queso burrito I can get down the street, which is literally nearly a thousand calories with the default options (no wonder they don't disclose their calorie information right there on the menu -- they'd go out of business).  The food at Muscle Maker grill is tasty, and I really appreciate that their business model is built around transparency about the nutrition you're getting when you eat there. I'm looking forward to trying more of their menu."}
{"text":"I have got delivered to my home and has been awesome and on time they do a great job."}
{"text":"I would give 2.5 stars if I could. Even though I am pleased they went out of their normal delivery zone to deliver to my work, I'm still disappointed. The prices are quite high for the amount and quality of food you get. 

Teriyaki wings- not really sure it was actually teriyaki sauce. And the celery and ranch were missing from the order. 
Baked potato- asked for sour cream and it did not have any on it. 
Turkey burger wrap- extremely salty. 
Santa Fe chicken wrap- wrap was pretty good. Cucumber salad not so much. 

Not sure I would return."}
{"text":"Had their Bison wrap and it was great!  All drinks there were pretty pricey though.  I love the idea of this place but it's a bit pricey to eat here."}
{"text":"Muscle grill is always a nice place to stop in for lunch keeping it on the healthy side, it taste great and has amazing costumer service."}
{"text":"Always Fresh and easy pick up
Nice to see owner and staff working and having a good time.
Definitely worth trying considering all the fast 'n fat-fried on that corner"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! If you live in the Maricopa County area, come to MMG for your Catering and Meal Prep! Ask for Scott! Tell him Derek sent you!!"}
{"text":"The El Mexicana bowl was delicious!  There was plenty of chicken and you would never think that this meal was a health conscious choice.  Low sodium, low fat, and low calorie never tasted so good!  While I was there, I sat near a chain restaurant manager that eats there often.  I don't blame him, I would eat there very often if it were a little closer to home but I will make the trip many times!  Home run for eating healthy with flavor!"}
{"text":"The service was nice and patient which i appreciated. I had no idea what to order and the associate was willing to answer any questions I had. The portion seemed small to me for the price but once I started eating I was full halfway in. The food was tasty I ordered the Arizona but I would like to go again to try other things! Overall would totally return."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good for high-protein and low cal/carb. They take time to explain what's special about the meal. If you are trying to eat healthy all the time and need variety, this is a pretty good bet."}
{"text":"Ordered a FRUIT SMOOTHIE, a chicken wrap and a bowl of chili.
1st thing I saw was her adding STORE BOUGHT Juice from a bottle into the blender. It was disgusting. It didnt even taste like FRUIT!!!!  The chicken wrap was pretty gross. The side cucumber salad was SOGGY and had NO flavor. The chili flavor was OK but the texture of the meat was like MUSH.  It was $21. Im glad I had half off but it wasnt even worth the $10.  Its been about 2 hours and MY STOMACH IS GURGLING.  Im pretty sure something was off in the food or the FAKE Fruit smoothie they made me isnt agreeing with my stomach. I wouldnt eat here again if it were free.  Super expensive and low quality bland food.  Sorry, but not sorry."}
{"text":"While I have driven past the Muscle Maker Grille several times, I really didn't have an interest because the name threw me off.   I thought maybe it was a body building place or something which is not my usual go-to restaurant.  Then we ran across a coupon on Resturant.com and gave it a try.  We were so surprised at the quality, quantity and variety of excellent, yummy food.  Now we stop in, not because we seek out clean eating food, but because the food is genuinely very good and filling, the service is quick and its reasonably priced.  The only reason they get 4 stars as the name under serves the actual menu."}
{"text":"Sante Fe chicken wrap, chose cucumber salad. It was delicious. Friendly staff, the girl who helped me was in training. She did great. Got talked into a smoothie after my meal. Tried a Strawberry and banana . Didn't make it  two lights away with it. So now my only problem is I don't live closer. Seriously considering meal prep. Had a wonderful experience after having it catering for my first experience. Either to go or in grill is good! Mid afternoon was the time of my visit. How much can you complain when someone is cooking the healthy food you want to eat for you! Manager was super attentive and checked in a few times."}
{"text":"Holy amazing!! My meal prep has never been easier! I come in get protein shake or fruit smoothie, pick up my preordered meal prep and I'm ready for my day! The girl that is always up front it's so sweet and always friendly! The food is great!! You have to try Rocky Balboa wrap! I can't get enough of this place, I use to drive all the way over to Scottsdale to get my meal prep but not anymore! Meals made easy!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! With the busy lifestyles today we tend to stop at McDonalds or somewhere to grab food instead of cooking when we get home the restaurant is not only healthy but reasonably priced. Clean, friendly, quick service you have to check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"Order is chicken Caesar Salad 9.49
Side of sweet potato fry 3.99 
Salad was small chicken was dry. 
Fries were small in portion. 
Not worth it and not impressed. Don't believe me? Order it yourself and pay the price. See if you're happy with your order. Go on I'll wait."}
{"text":"Please close the \"deli\" or w.e. you would call it. Yall can't handle more than 2 customers at a time and it always takes me 20+ min to get simple things. I have worked in the food industry for 11 years and this place just is under staffed.Great concept and idea that works for the meal plan side when they have time to prep but they need serious help on the deli side. I left after i ordered  a fruit smoothie that ended up being put last in line because other people got food after me. After 15 min of waiting and seeing that it wasn't going to be made soon i had just left. Oh well back to making it myself."}
{"text":"They NEVER answer the phone! At lunch I do not have time to wait 15-20 min for my order I need to call it in to pick it up. The food is good but this is a joke!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. We will not be returning here and will tell everyone we know to stay away. 

If I could give it less than one star, I would. Both my boyfriend and I ordered veggie wraps. Why it took so long I will never know but it took like twenty minutes. What we  got was a sprinkle of chopped tomato, mushroom, and green pepper with a little shredded cheddar wrapped in a nearly empty tortilla which was not garlic herb it was plain and there was nothing spicy about the wrap which is how I ordered it. I had barely boiled broccoli on the side and my boyfriends rice was dry and nasty. Definitely not worth eight bucks each and certainly nothing like the wraps they had pictures of on the wall or described on the menu. I could have made this at home for less than a dollar in under two minutes. The cook I can only hope was new because he asked us twice what we were having even though he had the order receipts right in front of him that he still had to check several times to remember what he was supposed to be doing. He told us he would get to ours as soon as he finished cooking chicken that he didn't even need. I just don't know how anyone could be so incompetent. Plus he was taking his good old time bs-ing with this other guy who didn't look like he belonged in a kitchen -- maybe on the receiving end of a soup kitchen. Not focused at all."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I came in for lunch and was so excited a place like this opened near us. He ordered the bbq chicken wrap and chocolate/peanut butter shake while I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with cucumber salad. He said the food was bland and something we could have made ourselves and I agreed. Nothing special here. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"We're so excited that this place is open!  My boyfriend and I walked in 20 mins before closing and the staff was so friendly and willing to answer any and questions we had about the menu. We placed our order to go and was ready in less than 5 minutes. The atmosphere is super chill and very clean.

We took our order home and noticed the packaging immediately. This is not your standard to-go styrofoam box but plastic containers that the food is presented perfectly in.  I ordered the MMG Signature Wrap and side Cesar salad which exceeded my expectations. The wrap was loaded with chicken and just the right amount of turkey bacon, rice, lettuce, beans and cheese. The jalapeño wrap and signature sauce tied everything together perfectly. My boyfriend ordered the Italiano Salad with chicken which included spinach, romaine, roasted red peppers, mozzarella and balsamic dressing. He and I were very pleased with our selections. And the portion sizes are spot on.

Needless to say we will definitely be back to Muscle Maker Grill!"}
{"text":"I got the sante fe wrap which was pretty tasty but I thought was too small for the price. It came with a side of baked potato which was plain but wasn't expecting much more at a \"healthy\" restaurant."}
{"text":"Bland overpriced food!!!  They pay more for the topper ware they serve it on than the food 
 healthy food doesn't need to be this horrible tasting never again.  Unless you like the taste of cardboard with a little seasoning"}
{"text":"Food took forever to be made, the protein shake tasted like flavored water and ice. The staff didn't know what half of the meals were. We ordered 2 wraps and it took 30 minutes, staff was sitting around talking"}
{"text":"I decided to do the meal plan. What I really liked was that Scott took the time to go over my options with me. He found out what I was looking to get out of this huge step I was taking with my health. And helped me plan in accordance. If I had to say anything negative about Muscle Maker Grill it would have to be that I got more food than I could eat. I felt that putting healthy food in my body kept me from over eating. I love this restaurant and the people that work here are super friendly."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.. They are never open during the times they say they are open. They always seem be out of something.. Just.. Nope."}
{"text":"Brand new to the body figure competition so I needed help with meal prep.  Mr Scott and his crew were patient, understanding and knowledgeable for what I needed.  I have order my meal prep for my 2nd week already and I have to say VERY VERY impressed!  My husband also orders his meal prep here and loves it too!  5 days 2 meals each day for $80!   You cannot beat that.  I do however special order some of my meals so comes out to $92.  Buuuuut  i spend more than that a week and have to find time to prep my food.  Id rather spend that extra time at the gym or practice posing.  My fave hands down Rocky Balboa!!  Pocahontas is my 2nd fave but I do add egg whites to it."}
{"text":"I visited on a whim after a trip to la fitness and I was impressed. The staff was friendly and the food was great. I ordered the Italiano salad; the portion was smaller than I hoped for the price, but it was delicious. I will definitely come back to try everything else."}
{"text":"I love this place for their Cajun Chicken & Penne. Def would recommend. Only thing is that it is extremely hot inside, it feels like a Sauna and I can never enjoy my food comfortably."}
{"text":"Some coworkers and I ordered from this establishment recently through UberEats (yep, I gave it a second chance) and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I think we all ordered the Grilled Chicken entree. The chicken was very moist, not dry. The broccoli and potato were good. I would probably order from them again especially if we were running low on time and it can be delivered (it's not particularly close to our office)."}
{"text":"I saw this on Groupon so thought I would try it out.  I've been here twice now.  The first time I got a protein shake and it was ok.  I can back a second time and wasn't expecting much,  got the Santa Fe chicken wrap spicy and the cucumber salad as the free side and is was unreal. SO GOOD! I'll defiantly be back and recommended to friends and family to try."}
{"text":"For delivery this place was great! Not many places deliver gluten free food that taste so good and is so good. They were more then helpful on the phone listing all there gluten free options. I ended up getting the God Father and it was more then enough to fill me! Thanks for making the Delivery"}
{"text":"Walked in here excited about a place that markets itself as healthy.  As soon as I opened the door I was hit by the strong smell of oil.  Lots of frying was happening!  I took a look at the menu and everything is meat and fried.  I quickly walked back out because a place that reeks of fried food and doesn't offer vegetarian options cannot seriously consider itself healthy.

Don't fall for the marketing - flat out lies.  This place is NOT healthy."}
{"text":"Love that there's a place where I can get a healthy meal that fits my diet and it super quick. Plus, it's right next to my gym so I can pop in right after my workout. More than that, the owner greets me by name when I come in. Wish there was one closer to my house though"}
{"text":"Wayyy too expensive for what you get.  I was so excited to find what looked like a healthy restaurant in the southside but it is just completely unreasonable as far as price.  The quality of food is mediocre at best as well.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Great place for healthy meals on the go! Went there today for the first time and the owner took my order and spent time chatting with me today. We ordered the SanteFe wrap, fajita wrap and the rocky balboa wrap. We liked them all. We even liked that our to go containers are reusable so we can use them as meal preparation during the week! We will definitely be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Im so disappointed with my meal! . Ive been so sick and unable to eat these last few days. I finally decided to give uber eats a try because I'm still to weak to go out. Ive never heard of Muscle Maker Grill before but they looked delicious and the most nutritious of my uber eats app choices. I ordered steak with a baked potato and steamed broccoli. What I received and what Im now attempting to consume because I'm starving is the driest, tasteless, toughest piece of steak on a dry bed if lettuce, a baked potato with nothing on it, no butter, no chives, literally nothing, steamed broccoli with no butter, no salt, no pepper. Its like eating a paper bag?? What the heck?!? Im so hungry and a paid almost $17 dollars for this meal, I'm forcing myself to eat it. And whats even worse is that the food arrived cold. That ill blame on the uber driver but come on!?!?! The first meal in a day and a half and it sucks! I had such high hopes. I was so excited to see a healthy option for dinner options for delivery for once.  wasted money!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure where all the bad reviews are coming from. This place was great. Lots of gluten free options. You can see them cook the food. I got the Arizona and not only was it great but they presented it with great display. The food was done fairly quickly and the cooks were all friendly. It's a great place and I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I had not heard of this place, but purchased a Groupon for this restaurant because myself and my wife are interested in clean, healthy eating.  I was very pleased with the meal.  I had the Rocky Balboa Wrap, my wife had the Turkey Meatball Parmesan Wrap both very good meals. Sides of spinach a bit plain, sweet potato fries a bit soft, mushy, my only criticisms. Great varied menu of low carb, low fat, organic foods.  Protein shakes, smoothies, salads, wraps, full meals, many sides and add-ons.  Calories and carbs available.  I want one in the Prescott-Prescott Valley area!!!"}
{"text":"1st time here, I had a low carb chicken wrap on a gluten free wrap with a cucumber side salad , it was great. The only down side was that a family came in with fast food, they knew the mgr or someone , that was a turn off for a \"healthy food\" place"}
{"text":"If you're looking for fresh and fantastic fuel, Muscle Maker Grill is THE place!!  So many tasty options and they have amazing meal plans. Very knowledgable and friendly service. I hardly ever get to eat out due to a strict meal prep diet until now. I ordered the Santa Fe wrap with steak with the cucumber salad. Lots of flavor and the steak was so amazing!!!  Make sure to stop in, you'll be so happy that you did! Don't be afraid to ask questions either. This place is passionate about healthy eating and genuine customer service!!"}
{"text":"The food isn't bad or good. It feels like stuff you could easily slap together at home. Nothing special at all. Good customer service."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Good, healthy food, good service, and plenty of options.  Don't forget to flex when you walk in!"}
{"text":"Perfect restaurant for those on a diet or those who just want to eat out but eat healthy. Everything has the calories listed. So many excellent choices available. We went for the first time yesterday and it all tasted great. I would have like the option of hot drinks, but my \"forbidden fruit\" smoothie was delicious."}
{"text":"Best place to get meal preps period!! I come from California so I don't plan much on what to eat so I stop here and ask for a weeks worth of meal preps and they gladly make them at the moment which is great I love this place and will keep going 5 stars isn't enough!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a healthy conscience meal and they also provide take home meals for the lazy meal preppers! The service is friendly and they make the food fresh when you order it. A must try for all you health nuts out there!"}
{"text":"Food was great and an excellent option for the southside dining scene and really Pittsburgh's dining scene in general."}
{"text":"What I love about this delicious joint is the concept.  Turning healthy ingredients into something yummy.  The core focus is ensuring you get sufficient protein into your meal.  Whether it's a wrap, burger or smoothie, you are going to get your protein.  The name of the restaurant practically spells out their business objective.

Conveniently, there is a gym near by for those who needs their protein intake post workout.  

The obvious flaw when entering the restaurant is the wall menu is a bit high for patrons to read and make an order.  Staring twice as much as you normally do at a menu is definitely not the best use of time when you are hungry as I was on this day.

What spurred our interest was a Groupon Deal that had to be used.  Luckily we did not regret that purchase.  The meal we ordered were a burger and a wrap.  This grass-fed beef burger on a wheat bun was outstanding.  I didn't expect it to bring all that juicy flavor but it did!  The chicken wrap was no ordinary chicken wrap.  The white meat chicken pieces were cooked perfectly with some grill marks and covered in delicious sauce.

Part of the meal deal included a smoothie.  So I tried one of their non-protein smoothies.  I wanted to see how fruity their smoothies were.  Luckily, the mango smoothie I decided on, contained fresh fruits which in my book is a huge plus.  Who likes artificial? 

If you are in the Peoria area, I highly recommend trying this \"healthy-ish\" joint.  You won't be disappointed.  The only caveat I want to sneak in is, the music is a bit outdated for a semi-modern place.  If you love the 70s and 80s, you'll have a blast to the past.  ;-)"}
