{"text":"Just left Brasseurs and unfortunately I cannot provide an opinion on the beer nor the food as the server did not have the courtesy to bring menus before informing us that we could not be there without eating, a side order was insufficient and a full  meal would be required. All delivered in a tone indicating it would please him most if we simply left. Excellent approach, Brasseurs."}
{"text":"We loved this place. Stumbled in with my husband and son while walking up Saint Denis, looking for a dinner destination that would have delicious food and wine but also be welcoming to our 6-year-old. Great prix fixe menu, solid beer and wine selection and excellent, friendly service. A good, solid spot in the Plateau."}
{"text":"I had the stout beer, which was quite good. My partner enjoyed his brown ale, as well.  I had the Montreal style ribs, which were fall-off-the-bone tender and tasty.  My partner had a burger topped with pancetta and gruyere.  The burger was fantastic!  Prices were quite reasonable, too."}
{"text":"The food was very good. We had the cold beef soup, followed by the roast pork (porc rote) as part of the prix fixe menu. One party member had a crab cake salad. All were delicious.

Good home brewed beer. 

We sat on the terrasse. It was ambient and allowed for good people watching. Would go again."}
{"text":"Grand resto. Superbe bière pas cher pan toute!!! Les ailes de poulet étaient cuites à la perfection. Service courtois et pas achalent.  J'aurais donné 5 étoiles, sauf qu'ils ont commencé à mettre la game d'hockey au lieu d'une musique d'ambiance relaxe... Le reste, impec'"}
