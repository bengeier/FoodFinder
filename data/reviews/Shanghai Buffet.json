{"text":"We went to have dinner at this restaurant based on the previous recommendations.  What a mistake!  Food was way below average, dried up and not at all tasty.  Service was pretty much non-existent.  When we ordered water we got these glaring looks!  The best part of my meal was the ice-cream and apple pies!"}
{"text":"I'll never come here again. Ate lunch looking forward to sushi and it was horrible. After chewing on it for a long time I finally tried some orange chicken, grilled chicken and beef and brocoli. Well I got what I expected from a buffet. For dessert I tried watermelon which was probably the best thing about the whole place. Mixed that with grapes, strawberries and bananas topped off with strawberry juice which made the bananas really soggy.

For a buffet, I didn't expect more or less. But the bill came to be $25 for 2 people. When I asked to get the bill separate it came to be $8 a person. Don't know where the extra ~$10 came from..."}
{"text":"This is the best chinese buffet in North Phoenix.  
Pros:  They have a sushi chef.  Try finding that anywhere.  They have all the regular dishes you'd expect at a chinese buffet.  Good quality and hot.  Cheap.
Cons: Limited on the salads.  Sometimes, something that looks like a salad or just plain lettuce.  The front door hasn't been cleaned since 1962.  The men's room urinal has had a black plastic bag on it since I've been going there for 3 months.  (Come on, fix the damn thing).  Both bathroom doors have not been cleaned since, well you get the idea.
Overall, I drive past a couple of other Chinese buffets to get here.  It's worth the trip."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of buffets but my husband and I happen to be in the area and figured we'd give it a try..  The bucket of trash before we walked in the dirty door was a red flag, but we were already there and my husband was hungry and grumpy.. I could only eat the soup and one piece of a chicken wing. I tried the egg roll.. It tasted like styrofoam.  The clientele was mostly families who let their kids touch every spoon on the buffet. Bottom line, this place was gross.."}
{"text":"This is a great place. My wife and our 2 year old daughter came here for lunch and it was great! The food and the service were fantastic. Can't wait to come back again....."}
{"text":"I haven't lived in AZ long, so I haven't been to many of the chinese buffets here yet. But so far this one is my favorite. The food was good with a good variety. My only complaint is that they only had a few crab legs out at a time, it seems they didn't keep up with that one dish enough. Other than that it was very tasty, my wife especially loved the sushi here."}
{"text":"Horrible food, went there for lunch today at 1 p.m. had to constantly wait for trays to be filled. Once the food did come out it was plain horrible. Selection  was weak compared to other buffets.....meats were fatty and food was greasy. I ended up eating mushrooms and broccoli from the beef n broccoli. The place was grungy and the workers were unpleasant. This place is sub-par even for a buffet joint. I am not too picky but I warn you choose a different buffet. Even Great Wall is better than this place."}
{"text":"wow. This place blows the predecessor out of the water. Food and service is light years better. They also have a full sushi bar that has both sushi and sashimi and kim chee. They have all the usual Chinese buffet fare as well. I think it's the crab legs that keeps most people coming here. I used to go to China Star just because it was convenient and I lived nearby - not that I thought it was great. Now I don't even hesitate to come to Shanghai Buffet - it rocks so much I forgot about the other Chinese Buffet choices nearby."}
{"text":"I was rather surprised to see their big selection.  Some of the foods tasted like they had come from a frozen packaging i.e the wontons.  BUT I was really shocked when I tasted their sushi! It's pretty darn good! It's the first Chinese buffet that has good sushi that I've seen in AZ."}
{"text":"The workers were very unpleasant.  I will never return and would not recommend it.  Everything is very greasy but I guess you get what you pay for.

When leaving we noticed our waitress leaning back in a chair with her bare feet up on one of the dinning  tables in the room off the front lobby.  Nasty!"}
{"text":"Less variety, but nice food.  Good deep fried tempura vegetables and ice cream."}
{"text":"Super Shanghai Buffet was Super Disgusting!

I should have lowered my expectations knowing that I was going to a buffet but, after reading the 4-star reviews for this place I was hopeful ...

Lets start with the overwhelming smell of fish that hits you the minute you walk into the place, then there was the food and serving utensils that were left on the floor, followed by the meth-head tweeker that couldn't stand still who proceeded to help himself to some watermelon using his hands! the ladies restroom was filthy. I've seen cleaner restrooms at truck stops and gas stations.

My husband took one bite of the food and I could tell by the look on his face that he was not pleased! He said it had a weird taste to it. The only god thing I can say about the food is that I did not get food poisoning!

Avoid this place at all costs!"}
{"text":"I took my niece here on a Monday night, so it could have just been because it was so slow, but the food was mostly terrible. The Orange chicken was pretty good, honey chicken also acceptable, but all seafood options tasted horribly bad. Even the peel and eat shrimp (how do you mess that up??) Tasted like it had been thawed, refrozen and thawed again. Desserts were also bad, I was excited to see coconut macaroons, but they were soggy and bad. Only thing keeping this place from 1 star was the friendly service, and a handicap being a slow weeknight. Probably will not be back."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for Chinese buffet and thought I'd give this place a try. The service was very well and the server was definitely fast and attentive. She cleared my table every time I left to try something else at the buffet and she smiled a lot! 
On to the food......the food at the buffet was hot and the staff exchanged out items pretty frequently. The sushi bar was nice and the variety was ok. The variety at the buffet could've been better. That's my only con was there wasn't enough variety....like general Tso's chicken or any pork dishes for that matter. :o(   
The deserts were there in plenty. I'd give it an extra star if they had more variety. But, for a casual lunch at a decent price then this place if for you."}
{"text":"My wife and I are fairly new to Phoenix and have been enjoying exploring all types of restaurants all over the area. I personally love Chinese buffets but have found many in Phoenix sub par to what I\"ve experienced in Denver and Chicago. However the Shanghai is the exception. The seafood offerings are very good with a wide variety of shrimp dishes, clams, fresh oysters and mussels (which I would prefer cooked in a black bean sauce) The barbecue ribs are spot on! They is plenty of other non seafood dishes that please my wife, who unlike me is not a seafood nut. Sushi is okay and the desert bar is on par with other buffets. Give it a try on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights."}
{"text":"A friendly staff at a Chinese buffet?  Really?  Why should it be such a surprise? I couldn't tell you... but it is.  And here, they are friendly.  Does it matter?  Not really; not unless they don't clear away the sea of plates you have generated from trip after trip after gut busting trip to the buffet table.  But nonetheless, they are friendly.  So walk in with a smile, why don't cha?  

I have been here for lunch, and I have been here for dinner.  There is always as significant amount of seafood available, even for lunch.  But if you want tons of seafood, hit it for dinner.  They have snow crab legs (which are actually fairly fresh, unlike at most other buffets), oysters, and multiple shrimp dishes that aren't available for lunch.  But even at lunch you can get shrimp a 1/2 dozen ways and a few other fish dishes.  And they have a sushi bar that is consistently manned, with more options than your usual token Chinese buffet sushi corner, including Nigiri, Maki, Sashimi, and others, along with the usual Sushi sides and condiments.  

This buffet also has the usual Chinese buffet options, along with a cold salad bar, an array of desserts, and 8 kinds of ice cream.  And for the unenlightened in your group, there is even french fries and pizza. 

The quality of the food here is high-end indeed.  It is best to go at busier times, because the food is refreshed more often, making your selections fresher.  I would give it five stars, but at off times some of the less popular dishes are not replenished eagerly enough by the staff, and the quality starts to wane, but only subtly.  Look for coupons in the Marketplace Clipper if you live nearby."}
{"text":"so sad that they are locked up tight with a notice on the door and thier phone is out of service.  'guess they didn't pay the bills.  

i joked that i had $50 worth of appetizers plus bbq, etc., every visit and that i would probably put them out of business.  hey guys, i didn't mean it.  and now i miss you.

on the way back, i stopped at the asian super buffet on bell rd. near 7th st.  'first time in years.  they were as bad as ever.

i have tried some across the north valley from scottsdale to sun city.  none have compared to shanghai buffet.

can anyone recommend a super buffet that is anywhere near as good as shanghai?  without going to shanghai, that is.  :)"}
{"text":"First time here, the food was good. Second time here, it was okay. Now, not so much. Doesn't seem fresh. Everything a bit flavorless.

Won't be back."}
{"text":"Myself and fellow Yelpers. Ryan C. Daren C. Norm R.and Rand H. met up at this above average chinese buffet. The food there was not bad they had a couple of dishes that were real taste like the honey chicken and the coconut shrimp. The staff were friendly and helpful try to explain a chinese fruit to us,i have already forgot what there called but you see them at alot of buffets (chinese).Anyway I had a great time there with the great company of fellow yelpers.And this place is worth a visit.  Oh ya they also have real icecream a real plus for me."}
{"text":"I saw all the reviews on this place and thought I would go here for lunch. The only bad thing I can think of is that it is too close to my work.  
First thing I noticed was this place had Kim-chee, seaweed salad. and fried fish skin!!! They basically had me at hello. 
The seafood delight is the best I have tasted from a buffet. Very well flavored and not drowning in sauce and brocolli. The stuffed crab was great and they had vegie tempura that was good too. The short ribs were well seasoned. Everything I tasted was good considering it was a buffet. The dishes were always being refilled and I never had to wait for anything. 

Not having too much of a sweet tooth I decided to just walk by the dessert section. Big mistake! They had nilla waffers covered with banana pudding. Can you say comfort food? So I grabbed a little and on my way back to my seat I picked up a malisada (donut) and fried banana. All was good!"}
{"text":"Bumping this one up one more star. I went for the Sunday lunch today - kinda late (about 2 pm, after the main lunch crowd had been served), so my expectations were not too high. But instead I was surprised and delighted. The frequent replenishment of the trays meant that I always got freshly-prepared food. The sushi chef continued to be busy preparing fresh sushi which was quite good, especially for a buffet restaurant. But wait ... there were also different kinds of really fresh sashimi, and tuna tataki!  And there were fresh oysters! All the cold and hot items I got were very good. So many great choices, I had to skip some so that I could have dessert. As usual, the servers were friendly and attentive. And I'm glad I had room for the real ice cream and the apple strudel. For $9.99, it was a great Sunday feast."}
{"text":"Went to this place over the weekend and was amazed by how packed it has become.  I've eaten here previously when I think it was owned by different people.  The food back then doesn't compared with what the foods like now.  

Wow, for a buffet there is a lot of selection.  They have a raw sushi bar with someone preparing it right in front of you.  They have a good selection of Chinese food with the classic dishes that's everyone's favorite.   Along with that they have different seafood selections with Crab Legs, all you can eat..  I'm not a big crab leg eater, but people around me were bringing back piles and piles back with numerous servings of plates.  My dishes were a mix of different items, and all were good.  For desert they have ice cream and some other sweets to choose from.  I picked the ice cream and it was yummy.  Tasted like Thrifty's Ice Cream to me..   

Price is cheap, and I have gone back a few times.  Every time I go back it seems more crowded, even a short wait if you have a large party.  But worth it if you have to wait."}
{"text":"Trust the one star reviews here - it's bad.  I don't know the motivation of those leaving 4 or 5 stars but they couldn't possibly have eaten here.  Unfortunately for us we thought the average rating of 3 and a half or so was good enough considering we didn't plan and were in a hurry to find something.   Upon arrival you will be welcomed with a greasy filthy stinky entry door that's never been cleaned.  Let that be a warning.  It's not too late to turn around.  I wish we had."}
{"text":"Based off of the recent reviews, I was looking forward to trying this place out. Walking into this place was a SHOCK.

Sticky tables with a visible layer of grime? CHECK
Months (years??) of dried on food flecks on the walls? CHECK
dirt & debris in every corner? check check CHECK

We were super hungry so we decided to just deal with the \"ick\" factor. 

Although the cleanliness was pretty sketch, the food wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. The sushi was pale in color which scared me a little. I was excited to see they had oysters but when I looked at them, it looked like someone had picked out the smallest and cheapest ones to serve. They mix in a ton of cabbage into their seaweed salad (an obvious attempt to stretch out their supply with a cheap add in). And fried foods as far as the eye could see-if you don't like fried foods, you would be hard pressed to find something to eat. The only item that was REALLY BAD was their baked salmon (it was AWFUL) which tasted like it had been on the line for DAYS. All their sauces tasted like a bunch of sugar had been dumped in them.

I will say, the toasted/fried squid was amazing, almost made up for the whole outing.....Almost.

Had a wee bit of difficulty getting our check because our server was busy watching the game on the tv....seriously, the guy was standing in the middle of the dining area just staring at the tv, really put me off. 

Chance of us coming back here? How do I put it......Scientology would have a better chance of being recognized as the one true religion than us coming back to this place."}
{"text":"The food is better than average for a buffet, BUT... the cracked and chipped dishes are a concern. The walls are filthy, so I will pass on a next time..or until they just make a few common sense improvements. The food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Good food, no complaints.  I was suprised though that half of the items offered weren't Chinese at all (fruit, pudding, dessert, fries...) I was a little disappointed that it cost us over $6 for my three year old to eat some fruit and a bowl of ice cream,  but oh well. I would come back,  just without the kids."}
{"text":"Was pretty impressed with the spread.  Everything was good PLUS good sushi & a Blue Bunny Ice Cream dipping cabinet with six flavors.  The food was fresh & there was a good variety.

The only drawback was they charge for soft drinks.  This seems to be the ongoing Chinese Buffett trend these days.  I'm not a fan of it at all- it's a Buffett!  The drinks should be built into the cost."}
{"text":"Slightly pricey for a buffet, but for a good number of choices, it works out..!"}
{"text":"Yup  I did it , I took the family to the Boofay and it didn't make us sick ! 
I am not usually a huge buffet kinda gal  but I was interested in trying this place and with the Recommendations of the S.C.A.B. Y . 
( Superior Crew of Boofays of Yelp)  also known as Ryan , Daren, Rand, Norm and Iain. I was sure I couldn't go wrong . Taking in consideration of the genre of this establishment this was a pretty good operation. While a pungent sour smell hit you upon walking in  you quickly dismissed it upon the viewing of food.  The food was strongly  decent . My favorite was a chicken they named BBQ chicken , ironic because it was a light teriayki , but whatever, it's their restaurant and they can name it whatever they like. But it wasn't BBQ.
They also had  ---wait for it ---Crab legs.. cool !!  The other items were good and looked good: Veggies on the line still looked fresh and not overcooked. They had some interesting fish concoctions with shrimp and octopus  that caught my interest. The sushi line looked once again, decent but of course tasted only okay.  Orange Chicken and Beef Rib  tasted good .There was also big assortment of shrimp dishes , for a minute I went all Bubba Gump ..
 Fried Shrimp , Salt and Pepper Shrimp, Shrimp Tempura, Cold Shrimp, Coconut Shrimp then I remembered its 2010  and I snapped out of it.  They also had a few desserts which we didn't try and Ice Cream which the kids fully appreciated. 
For the price of 10.00 a person it was reasonable if you take into consideration its a  Chinese Buffet. We decided this a good place to go if you are craving Panda express or Teriakyi  Chicken .  
Service was good and we got in and out of there relatively easily."}
{"text":"Tasting something delicious from a buffet  ANY BUFFET usually never happens because it is always at best just A-OK or not so good or a spit out . I tasted Mongolian beef that was absolutely delicious , beef ribs that were meaty and not fatty , tasty flavorful spicy white fish , juicy chicken sticks and bok choy that was sauteed with hand chopped fresh garlic and finished with a hot fresh donut . This is not the prettiest buffet and not the biggest but I would call it  take out quality . (if you are lucky enough to have good Chinese take out near your home) with good service .

 I do note that all buffets change things up and HOPEFULLY the next selections will be just as tasty and fresh .

A chain Chinese Buffet will be opening almost next door behind Freddy's Custard that will be new and prettier but if the taste of good food from Shanghai is a world a part in difference ."}
{"text":"The coconut shrip is the best! My family & I go here once every few months. We like it a lot. I went here a lot when I was pregnant with my twins who are now 15 months old & they still remember me & my kids even if we havnt gone in awhile."}
{"text":"If you like China buffets for lunch, this is your place. It was clean, there was a good selection of food including several tasty chicken dishes, they offered decent sushi(we all know it's usually terrible at buffets!), and there were no foul odors when I walked in. Next time it's a China buffet day, I will definitely go back to Shanghai Buffet."}
{"text":"I have been to many asian buffets in my life, but I have to say that this one is the worst.  The food was luke warm, and tasteless.  Both my son and I felt sick after only eating a small amount of the food.  I don't know how anyone could rate this as anything but bad.  The health department will be notified as I believe that food was not being kept at proper temperatures."}
{"text":"This is a nice little buffet to come to for a quick cheap lunch. Maybe not that quick, since it is a buffet and I do like to take my time eating. Shanghai Buffet had a decent variety of food to choose from and seemed to have a steady flow of customers for lunch time which is usually a good indication. The staff here was really nice and the service was excellent.

I got a little bit of everything just to try and the food was...food. It wasn't bad, and it wasn't OMGYUM good, it was just...food! I don't really know how to explain that, but to sum it all up - I'd come back here if I wanted to eat at a cheap buffet and I was in the area."}
{"text":"I like to call this place Chinese Christmas Buffet. They always have Christmas decorations out. Foods... meh.. its ok."}

We came, we ate, we reviewed. There should be some nice reviews from my fellow Yelper's. We each have our favorites and our dislikes. 

We all agree, this place was good. I will allow Rand to expand on the # of trays and the various types of food. 

I had a little bit of everything, except the sushi and some of the exotic seafood. I stuck to the fish and the shrimp. 

Hot and sour soup was good,but not too hot 
Dumplings were good 
Fried Rice was good 
Spicy Chicken 
Coconut shrimp 
Spare ribs 
Green beans 
Orange chicken 
Honey chicken 
Thin noodles (reminded me of ponciet) 
Fried fish 
Fried shrimp 
Beef and broccoli 
and some others 

All the food was good, fresh and had nice variety. 

They serve real Thrifty Ice cream, which is a nice treat."}
{"text":"This place is just ok. Restaurant is dirty especially the restroom. Makes me wonder what the kitchen look like. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to try this place for lunch on a business trip. I was not impressed. I would never take the wife here. It was very fishy smelling on the way in. Very dated. The bathrooms had a sewer stink.  Some of the food was good, but most of it I could have done without. $11.00 with tip."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out since it got lots of good Yelp reviews. It's not too bad; it's ok. Probably one of the better Chinese buffets I've had - but no means \"off the chart\" great.  It was palatable and served its purpose of getting some substance for lunch hour. 

The place was nice; the waiter and hostess were nice; perfect place to get away from the office for an hour and not be hurried or harassed by a waiter. They had a TV on ESPN, so I got to catch some of the Dbacks trade news (Goodbye Ian Kennedy), so it was an enjoyable hour.

prolly more like 2-1/2 stars."}
{"text":"I've been to several buffet places and this one it top of the list. Great selection, plays regular music, fresh sushi, crawfish, crab legs, oysters, and much much more."}
{"text":"There is very little redeeming about this place.  The food is subpar and frankly just bad in most cases.  I sampled 10 items and the only thing remotely good was the rice and frankly how could they F up rice?  I literally will never come here again and in hoping and hoping I don't end up sick before the end of the day.

Side note: It took 2 hours before I was sick.  I should have known better.

The building is old and dirty.  I don't see their health dept rating but I doubt it has an A in it.  Yuck.  I think I need a shower now."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. Most things here feel like they've been sitting out here for awhile and get hard or stale but some things are still good. 

Sadly the best place for Chinese food I've found in town."}
{"text":"Went there for a sunday dinner with the family and I thought it was just ok.
I have never really been much for buffets so I thought I would try it anyway.Kind of reminded me of the old place that was there except they had sushi and maybe next time I can go with someone that knows the different types so I know what it is that I am eating."}
{"text":"After I read the reviews about this Shanghai Buffet. I still want to give it a try. And this is the first time we go to this place. We will never go back. It just waste my money and time and everything else. None of the food taste good to me. No wonder why it was so empty when we first arrive there! Next time when you walk into an empty restaurant, you should know why. Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"Hersey squirts immediately after eating here.  Couldn't even cut the dumplings with a fork.  Everything was stagnant and nothing new was cooked while I was there for lunch.  NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"I came here looking for a Chinese buffet that was decent. I left feeling pretty underwhelmed. If you like seafood then this is definitely your joint. Sadly, I won't touch the stuff so the food options were pretty limited for me. Minus big points. The food wasn't stellar but it was better than some places I've been to where it feels like things have been sitting out all day. Service wasn't rude but definitely not outgoing in any way. Can't say I'd ever have a reason so come back. Disappointing... :("}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is fairly standard for an oriental buffet--nothing too special but didn't notice any cleanliness issues so was satisfied.  I found the general selection to be quite broad, prices fair (coupons can be found online or in Entertainment book, etc), and the food was good.  No complaints and would probably go back the next time I crave oriental food."}
{"text":"This place used to be good but I think maybe they have new cooks. Still it's ok as buffets go. My issue is that when it's time to pay you need to be sure to watch your bill. I have a family of 5 and the last 3 times we've visited this place our bill has had mysterious extra charges between 6-9 extra bucks. After my last and probably final visit I think I figured out what was going on. I could be wrong but it looked suspicious. After the drink server would collect your payment she we tear up the checks and wright out a new one. I must say it's a very creative way to get a bigger tip if thats what she is doing.  Either way do your own math when the check comes because as I said this wasn't the 1st time the check was way off. At best they are just really bad at math."}
{"text":"I will give three stars just on the fact that it's right around the corner and I haven't fallen ill, other than that I've had better in the way of Chinese buffets. It's certainly not the worse, just take the food and the overall look, I've been to better..."}
{"text":"Some yelpers get on the \"no chain restaurants\" idealistic bandwagon, which is a worthy cause, if not taken to an extreme form of foodier-than-thou pretension. However, there seems to be a lack of acknowledgment that the lowly, oft-forlorned, buffet and other Chinese restaurants are almost always independently, family-owned and run, local businesses.   Seeing the same employees everyday, obviously working 12+ hour shifts, sometimes with their children sitting in a booth doing school work, is the epitome of the local indie ideal. They are making a small profit margin , too (otherwise they might upgrade the interior amenities more often), so cut them some slack and if you know you don't like a buffet format, then don't go to one and give a bad review because a chef didn't plop your steaming hot dish from his pan to your plate, or because someone brought their grubby children for a bargain priced night out.

Shanghai is still one of tastiest buffets in north phoenix.  The food is very good , judging against other restaurants of it's kind, of course, this is a qualified 5 stars. One cannot go in expecting fine dining atmosphere and expect to pay less than $10 for their meal if one is of sound mind.  I'm not sure what some reviewers expect when they start their comments off with a phrase like \"i dont even like buffets\" and then proceed to rip a place apart because other people were touching the serving spoons! I wish I was an owner here. I'd make no effort to kiss the butt of the customers trying to walk all over me.  ( The staff is very friendly to regulars, as well as angelicaly patient with grumpy, demanding, difficult customers.  )  I'd tell them to take their pretentious, trying-not-to-pay $80 butt and gtfo. 
Criticisms of the place being old are warranted, and there is a lack of cold salad greens. The latter is made up for with some delicious veggie dishes of bok choy, green beans, broccoli, and/or spinach hot dishes. There are slower days, and especially slower times of day when you may not see many customers  and the food may replenish a little slower. When the Friday night or Saturday afternoon rush is on though, both the restaurant and crowd of customers seem to gell into a single well oiled machine. 
PS There are almost always coupons available from Val pak, Clipper, etc."}
{"text":"I am not normally a fan of Chinese buffets, however, this one has been consistently wonderful each time! My husband and I have been there multiple times, and on each occasion there is warm, tasty food and a huge selection. 

Location -- The location itself is fairly clean and a decent size. The booths are large and comfortable. The tables with chairs look comfy, but I haven't ever tried them. Oh and the bathrooms are VERY clean ( I can only speak for the womens one! ).. which was a surprise in itself, considering so many businesses do not take care of their bathrooms for some reason. 

Sushi --- unlimited sushi is included in the cost of the buffet too! If they do not have something you like, but have the ingredients, they have custom made one for me every single time. 

Staff -- Super friendly and very attentive. Our glasses barely get to half full before someone is asking us for a refill. Our plates are cleaned up promptly as well. 

Food selection -- they have a large selection and everything I have tried has been good to excellent. Anything you would except at a Chinese buffet and then some other extra stuff. As mentioned, they do not really have a salad, but I don't think most people who go to a Chinese buffet are there for the salad! The dessert section is decent, however most of it is bleh. But by the time you have the excellent tasting food, there is usually no room for dessert. They do however have self serve ice cream and that is usually always good!  The crab rangoon is probably the best I have ever had here in Phx. 

The price is excellent - for 2 people we can have dinner and drinks with tip for about 30$. Since this includes sushi, it is a great deal. They do have crab legs at dinner, however, with crab, you kind of get what you pay for! 

I believe the lunch buffet is like 20$ for two people with drinks included. 

So if you like Chinese food, give them a try, I am almost positive you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This eatery opened on November 15th.  Pretty gutsy thing to do, opening a restaurant in a recession within the shell of another that went out (China Star Restaurant).

For what it's supposed to be, it does a very good job.  The food is fresh (crispy dishes are crispy, no wilting, no morsels cooked fast onto the serving tray) and tasty enough.  Good selection of Chinese dishes with some Korean and Japanese as well.

It has a sushi area that was good, but not as good as it could be--it wasn't bad, but it wasn't restocked very often.

A good value.

I'll go again and take a co-worker or two as well."}
