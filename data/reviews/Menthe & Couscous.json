{"text":"It was my first time trying Moroccan food and since it was halal, I was excited to try it out. I got slightly disappointed by their food. It wasn't that great but at least I got to try tajine. However, I liked the ambience. We actually had a great time there.   We chose their group menu, so got to try a lot of their dishes. You can bring your own wine or if you don't drink alcohol, then you can bring sparkling juice like I did lol  You can read my full review along with pictures on my blog: http://arzanrestos.blogspot.ca/2014/03/menthe-et-couscous.html"}
{"text":"J'ai passé à plusieurs reprises devant ce petit restaurant en me demandant si ça valait le coût d'essayer cette place de type maghrébine.  J'ai été malheureusement très déçu et n'y retournerai pas. Et voici ce pourquoi:   1. Les plats manquaient de goût, d'épices.  2. J'ai trouvé un long, très long cheveux dans mon couscous. 3. Les prix sont trop coûteux pour ce qui est proposé au menu.  Un total de 50,00$ pour seulement 2 assiettes de couscous, soit un au poulet et un végétarien et 2 verres d'eau ... et c'est sans compter le pourboire.   C'est malheureux à dire, mais je fais personnellement un meilleur couscous et à moindre coût. Alors pourquoi y retourner si ce n'est que pour avoir le décor du Maghreb en mangeant mon couscous? _______________________________________________  I passed by several times in front of this small restaurant and wondered if it was worth the cost of trying this place.  I was unfortunately very disappointed and will not return. And here's why:  1. The dishes lacked taste, spices. 2. I found a long, very long hair in my couscous. 3. Prices are too expensive for what is on the menu.  A total of $ 50.00 for only 2 plates of couscous, one with chicken and one vegetarian and 2 glasses of water ... and that's besides the tip.  It's unfortunate to say, but I personally do a better couscous and at lower cost. So why I would go back if it's only for the typical decor of the Maghreb?"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place doesn't have a five star average. Rarely can we find places that offers A refreshingly original culinary Avenue for those, who just as me, are tired of always eating the same old traditional Italian/Asian/western food. I had the best Lamb tagine that I ever had in Montreal. The meat was so moist that I literally felt it was melting in my mouth. I think it's also really great that the meet is all halal as this is the only type of meat that I eat."}
{"text":"This place is TERRIBLE. You probably won't be sick or anything, but the price they ask for the quality they give is ridiculous. Chicken pastilla was a tasteless aggregate of overcooked bird, stuck in a dry sock, with a cinamon challenge on top as the only spice. The full luxury experience couscous for 30 dol was supposedly a combo, but came in a single serving, complete joke, two sad strips of chicken, a sad dried apricot and way too many nuts. Couscous is supposed to feel like a generous and succulent dish and this was depression in a foil container. The soup was a warm lemon juice with nuts and tomato. Not bad. Not worth it. If this was cheap, I wouldn't have said anything. But a rip off at a less than average quality is not tolerable. Go to K Moon or Les deux oliviers. Much better."}
{"text":"Yummy! My husband and I split the Couscous Royal with lamb, chicken, and Moroccan sausage, and it was delicious! It was also enormous, so we had lots of leftovers to take home. The Moroccan mint tea was delicious, and they let you add your own sugar. I don't like my tea as sweet as Moroccans drink it, so that was great!   We went on a Sunday night, and the atmosphere was subdued and quiet. There was limited staff and just a few other couples there. Cozy atmosphere, beautiful decorations, and an eclectic mix of music."}
{"text":"Spent a birthday weekend in Montreal and decided to try out this little Moroccan restaurant for dinner on Saturday night. It was around 6:30 when we sat down to eat so the place wasn't quite packed but it steadily got busier.   We were seated directly by the open window was great for catching a breeze, but a little tricky if you're dining with a very fidgety one-year old. As a side note, if you're planning to bring an infant or smaller toddler, they didn't have a highchair, so be warned. We were kindly offered a booster seat, but there was no way to strap it into the actual chair so I spent more time trying to keep my daughter from toppling off. We managed to get through the meal without incident, although it was a little awkward because there were some folks sitting outside on the benches just directly staring at us the entire time.  We ordered the moussaka to start, and then continued on with entrées of the couscous Royal and merguez tagine. The moussaka wasn't exactly as I pictured (I guess I was thinking more of Greek moussaka I'd had before? ) but this was actually a dip of blended tomatoes, eggplant and peppers topped with raisins and served with four small buns. It was tasty but I found it a bit too sweet for a savoury dip because the raisins sort of took over and masked the other flavours. The bread was warm and soft and it was a good size for two people to share.   The mains were where this place really shined. The couscous royal was jam-packed: juicy lamb, a good sized chunk of chicken breast and a merguez sausage combined with super soft strips of zucchini, carrot, sweet potatoes and chickpeas all on a bed of couscous. My only real complaint would be that the chicken was a bit on the dry side, and that the merguez wasn't grilled, so the texture was a little unappetizing even though the flavour was still good.   Would definitely return here when I go and visit MTL in the future."}
{"text":"Fabulous night of great food, drink, and festivities. The wait staff took great care of us...highly recommend this Moroccan delight! Had the Chicken Couscous, Tagine Chicken, and Brik! The entertainment was the highlight of the night!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I tried Moroccan cuisine so I'm not a good judge for the food. I had the lamb tajine. It is served in a large portion and with couscous on the side. I liked the warm couscous, with chickpeas topping. The lamb dish was cooked with exotic choice of ingredients like prunes and apricots. I liked it until it got a bit boring after some time and I couldn't finish the dish. It's also a bring your own wine restaurant, so it's very convenient."}
{"text":"In our visit to Montreal we had the chance to try this Mediterranean restaurant. The mainly offer couscous and tajines. I took the couscous royal with a lamb shank, a chicken stripe and oriental sausage. My wife took the chicken tajine with lemon and green olive. We loved our experience there with amazing flavors from the Mediterranean region The sauce and broth they have for the couscous is so special and rich with flavors and spices.  Our waitress was very friendly and answered all our detailed questions about the plates with attention and passion. She also gave us recommendations and appetizers suggestion. We ended our meal by sharing their home-made dessert omali. Very rich dessert with coconuts, milk and raisin. It was a very good choice. I told my friends back home about this restaurant for their visit next week. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are visiting Montrea"}
{"text":"Went there recently for brunch with friends and thoroughly enjoyed this new refreshing take on this idea. Loved the service, food & pricing all around. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Décor: 1.5 - le décor oriental est sympathique même si les tableaux de l'entrée sont un peu décalés par rapport au reste. Mais l'expérience la pire demeure les banquettes... Table trop haute par rapport à la banquette, inconfort total pour manger!  Service: 3 - la serveuse arrive à gérer les 10 tables que comporte le restau. Mais cela demeure un peu long pour la commande, les plats... Bouffe: 2.5 - j'aurai voulu mettre 3 pour le goût, mais je ne conçois pas que l'on puisse nous servir le couscous déjà mélangé sans possibilité de se resservir soit en semoule soit en légumes. La présence de haricots verts et l'absence de navet sont originales mais en fin de compte déplaisantes. L'agneau était très très sec et les merguez n'avaient pas été cuites sur le grill. Rapport qualité/prix: 2 - petites assiettes mais prix assez élevés... Un des seuls avantages, est qu'il s'agit d'un \"Apportez votre vin\" c'est pas suffisant pour le considérer. Au final, la note est de 9/20 qui me semble juste pour le restaurant que c'est. Dommage un bon couscous dans le quartier latin aurait bonifier l'offre du secteur, mais malheureusement l'expérience laisse un goût amer (et non épicée!). Pour un couscous il vaut mieux préférer ceux qui en offrent sur le Plateau."}
{"text":"Il y a des moments où vos papilles se souviendront toujours!!! pour bien connaître les saveurs marocaines ce sont surtout vous yeux qui auront du plaisir"}
{"text":"The owners host us like we are at their home Played with our kid and were extremely nice The bric was phenomenal Definitely will come back and recommend to everyone  Thank you"}
{"text":"My wife & I were visiting in Montreal last weekend. A friend highly recommended this restaurant and took us. We spent an amazing Saturday evening here.  Enjoyed their belly dance show with dinner.  food and service. The lamb couscous is to die for, so delicious. I also think the staff & owners go out of their way to make you feel special.  I recommend it for a Saturday night out."}
{"text":"Very good choice with being your own wine option. The couscous lamb is amazing and the tajines lamb too. My friends and I shared 4 plates and they were all very good giving different flavours.  Nice background music and very nice decor. I took their mind tea and it was served in really nice colourful small glasses. Very nice discovery."}
{"text":"Not at all authentic Tunisian or Moroccan food. The couscous dish they served us was stale and smelling strange ( smells old ).  The grilled salad was so garlicky and the tuna was bizarre."}
{"text":"Superbe moment, nourriture extra et dans la plus belle tradition du couscous! En tant que fan de couscous, je vous recommande chaudement cette adresse!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, very nice and friendly staff. bring your own wine so you can send great time over there. will defiantly come back"}
{"text":"We were a group of 8 on last Saturday night for the belly dance show dinner. Our seating was on the groups corner where there are comfy couches all around and nice cushions. The decor is matching the restaurant them and gives its warmth. We had the 4 course set menu dinner for the belly dance evening show. We had the choice between the traditional soup (Chorba) and the chef salad. Both were very good as we tried from each other's. I took the lamb couscous, the meat was so tender it falls off the bones and melts in your mouth. My friends took the tajines lamb and tajine chicken, and couscous merguez, all was delicious and served in big portions.   We ended up the meal with refreshing green mint tea and sumptuous Baklawa dessert.   The belly dance show was entertaining and the belly dancer herself was friendly and approaching the crowd to dance and have fun. It was an exquisite experience for us. We loved the food, ambiance, service and music."}
{"text":"Delicious, and helpful waitstaff. Though its a modest space, it wasn't too full or loud - but not at all deserted. The coucous was fantastic. We ordered the mousakka (not the same as the Greek version, sweeter and served with olive bread) and the the Royal Couscous platter with merguez (beef and lamb sausage, strongly flavored), lamb shanks, chicken and veggies. For two, this was very generously portioned and delicious. The veggies and chicken were surprisingly my favorites, despite my deep love of lamb.  At around 2000 there was a floor show of belly dancing which went on a little longer than was really necessary,  but stylistically,  the performer was one of the better belly dancers I had ever seen, and some of the floor staff joined her in a very fun group dance.  Overall, this was a wonderful find from a MTL blog article on the best morrocan restaurants in the city. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great place for an intimate dinner with friends or a date. The Moroccan themed setting was unique and had a warm ambience.   My boyfriend and I both ordered Couscous, $19 each. The Merguez, which are Tunisian lamb sausages, was juicy and spiced well. The Chicken was average, slightly dry. The meats are served on a bed of saucy and tasty couscous and assorted vegetables. The Baklava, $4, was light and crispy and finished the meal off nicely.  Tad pricy for what it is but a great option to try something new amidst the abundance of pub food in the area."}
{"text":"Worse tajin ever. Restaurant smells bad,lack of personal.bad attitude.loud music, so slow, very hot when served."}
