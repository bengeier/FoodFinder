{"text":"I completely agree with Kimberly said. BLAND CITY!!!  Hopefully my dogs will like the leftovers. But I doubt it."}
{"text":"Came here trying a new place. Literally! Just opened two days ago and well worth it! Warmly welcomed at the front by a nice hostess, and we're told we could even have a seat in the bar. Since we were interested in the Pirates game, it worked out, they have a few TV's in the bar for such purposes. 
We ordered our drinks; Prosecco & Malbec. Both by the glass. Our server gave us big glasses of water with out drinks so A+ there. 
The bread came out first and it was awesome. Perfectly warmed, large slices, crunchy crusted Italian bread that tasted like it was made in house. Served with ambient temperature butter (another pet peeve of mine is ice cold butter) so A+
The salad came out next and was the first area where we'd recommend a little change, maybe a little larger for sharing between two. But it was flavorful, cold, and dressed just right. The fresh cracked pepper added to it so overall: B
Next our entrees: I had the Three-Cheese Lasagna my partner had the Gambellini Fra Diavolo (sorry if I misspelled it.) they came out at just the right temperature and at the same time. I tried a bite of his dish and the Diavolo was mild, but with a \"back-of-the-throat\" heat which is perfect. So: \"A\" for his dish. My lasagna was rather impressive, and I didn't realize the recipe was total cheese lasagna, but it was delicious. The only downside would be a personal preference of a little more herbs or spice in the cheese mixture. The tomato  sauce was slightly sweet and tasted of homemade. So well worth trying! 
Overall the reason behind the 4-star review is only for the slight downsides, but again, could just be my personal preference. 
I highly recommend coming here to try it out! Great ambience and extensive menu."}
{"text":"Overpriced and flavroless.  This place tries really hard to seem fancy, but falls far short.

The bread was fantastic, but it was paired with ice cold, solid butter.  The salad, as others mentiones, had very little nearly-flavorless dressing.  

I had the chicken marsala ($18).  The three chicken tenders that comprised it were tender.  The sauce, however, was a mess.  It was as if they splashed some marsala wine on the plate, and then dumped the chicken onto the plate, oil and all, straight from the sautee pan.  It was sweet, watery, spotted with oil, and devoid of any kind of seasoning.  Oh, it had a few sliced mushrooms, too.  I chose pasta with white sauce for the side.  Bad move.  It was pasta tossed in plain white sauce - no cheese, no garlic, not even a bit of salt.

My wife had the shrimp scampi ($22).  It came with 4 or 5 shrimp that were actually quite big.  They weren't overcooked.  The sauce, again, was a watery mess, a bunch of butter quickly thrown together with some white wine.  The whole thing was topped with *garlic powder*.  I don't think any of it was seasoned with salt or anything else.  She chose broccoli for her side.  Aside from the bread, the broccoli was the best part of the meal.

Come here if you're looking to spend $20 a plate for food that's below even Olive Garden's standards.  The service here was slow and unenthusiastic, and I'm willing to bet that none of the cooks have ever actually tasted the food they're sending out.

I only gave it two stars because the food did not make me sick."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant for my birthday dinner which was less than memorable. Our entrance less than a.warm greeting by a young blonde girl at the host stand. \"Hi, just two of you?\"not all that welcoming. Brought to our seat and was not informed of any daily specials. Was not presented a wine list but asked for one and got a not to impressive small list. Who has lambrusco on the menu? This place does. Opted for a mixed drink since wine choices were slim. Had the bruschetta. Appetizer. Nothing to write home about. Bland, no seasoning. Wife had pasta with salmon. Salmon was small tail end piece that was overcooked and dry. I had veal and peppers which was dredged in too much flour and not shaken off before sauteed. Asked for bread twice before i got three small slices that was told just came the oven, (cold). Asked for warm bread and finally got it as i was taking my last bite of veal. Also had to ask for water twice. Needless to say i had a subpar meal and terrible service. I usually give a place a second try but since both meals were average on a good day and no wine selection, we wont be back"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Pazzo's for dinner during restaurant week.  We were both disappointed with our entrees.  We ordered off the restaurant week menu.  We both loved the lobster bisque.  My husband's crab ravioli was not warm.  My veal romano was hard and difficult to cut and eat.  My vegetable, carrots, were also not soft enough to chew. We enjoyed the ice cream for dessert.  The waitress was very friendly and attentive.  We may try Pazzo' s for lunch, but we wish we would have chosen a different restaurant for dinner."}
{"text":"Review is based on service and bar only - did not order food. 

Place was empty on Friday night. First warning sign.  My wife and I sat at the bar to order drinks and contemplate dessert. It was ten minutes before our order was taken. Second sign. Drinks were poured, took five minutes to find a lime for my wife's drink. Third sign. 

We decided to skip dessert. We could tell as we looked around, wait staff was poorly trained and disorganized. This place needs help. Beautiful interior, and like I said - did not try the food. But with the number of good Italian places in Pittsburgh, come on - need to up your game!"}
{"text":"The wedding soup was so good! After eating that I was hopeful that the reviews on here weren't accurate... I'm sorry to say that they are true! I would come back for the soup but wouldn't eat dinner here again. We came for restaurant week and the menu looked amazing but the actual food was pretty poor."}
{"text":"The parking lot is always empty which isn't a good sign. 
But still wanted to give it a try. 
No hostess. Waited a few minutes before the bartender came out to seat us. 
My menu was dirty.
My silverware was dirty.
Glasses spotty. 
Come on guys. If you're slow and still can't keep things clean.....?
Food was ok, but definately didn't live up to the prices. I am in the business and it makes me sad when a new restaurant doesn't do well. 
These little details could easily be fixed."}
{"text":"We had a great experience for dinner a few days ago! The service was wonderful and our server was very knowlegeable about the menu. I am gluten free and my daughter is egg and dairy free and she was able to guide us to the best choices. The kitchen appears to be careful about food allergies and cross contaimination. From our zucchini appitizer, family style salad, entrees and wine, everything was beautifully presented and tasted great. The courses were well paced and we had plenty of time to enjoy the warm,remodeled space with tables with white tableclothes. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I really liked this place. Huge step up from Stonepepper Grill. Our server was very attentive and the food was quick and on point. Tried the bruschetta, chicken parm and cajun salmon. Every dish was good and the chicken parm was better than many spots in the area. The one negative was the hostesses attitudes. They seemed stressed and frustrated that they were busy at 7pm in a Friday night which should make them happy, right?"}
{"text":"Wow. So surprised at the one and two star reviews!  We started with the most tender calamari. Although the marinara sauce was a bit bland, but a touch of salt made it just right. My husband had the veal with peppers and said it was so delicious and tender. The mashed potatoes were perfect. I had the salmon Diablo which was also delicious. Our salad was beautiful! Dressing was served on the salad and it was a nice amount. We ended our delicious meal with a piece of tiramisu. Our server Matt was right on!! Very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. Our appetizer, salad and entrees were timed perfectly. I love salad and did not mind that my entree was served while I was still eating it! No problem it let my dinner cool to just the right temp for me to eat it comfortably. 
I wonder sometimes if people just don't appreciate relaxing and taking time to eat a wonderful and beautifully prepared meal.  A wonderful atmosphere. So relaxing. The chairs are super comfortable too!!! We will certainly be back. 
Give it a try.  Don't  always go by the reviews. 
A bottle of Riesling, calamari app, two delicious entrees and dessert for $92! 
Well with it."}
{"text":"I really don't have too much to say other than the fact that I sent my food back and decided to just grab something to eat somewhere else.  Four of us went on a Friday night and were seated almost immediately.  Ordered drinks and 23 minutes later they show up.  Dinner was bland and not even italian food...

Pesto should at least have pine nuts and basil right?  Mine was tortellini with olive oil and parsley.  The service was slow and even after we complained no one came over to say a word or find out what they could have done better. 

Oh, and a kettle one martini was 12.75  For ketel one and some vermouth.  WOW.   There is no way that the mgmt cares about this place based on all the other reviews."}
{"text":"When we received stale bread upon our arrival, I wish we would have left.  Looking to give this new local restaurant a try, we stayed and ordered the zucchini for an appetizer, which was good; however nothing special.  After eating our app we waited approx 45 mins to receive our salads and wait for our drinks to be refilled and plates to be taken off the table.  Keep in mind, the restaurant was almost empty but there were only two people working.  Our waitress did not only function in that role but many others as well, she was waitress/bartender/busboy/manager.... I think she may have even been in the back cooking some things as well. Anyways, the service was lacking along with the quality of food.  Overall, our experience dining here was one of the worsts, and we do not plan on ever going back, we left here with sick stomachs, and a lot of time wasted.  
There are many better restaurants in the area, I would much rather spend my money at."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food here because we didn't get that far. We were in a hurry on a Friday and there was an hour wait at Bonefish so we decided to try Pazzo because we wanted to since it opened. The parking lot was pretty empty and very empty inside. I guess now I know why. They seated us immediately and then nothing. We saw other waiters at other tables and people cleaning up and nobody even looked at us. It was like we were invisible. They weren't even busy. After almost 15 minutes we got up and left and my husband told the hostess we would not be coming back. I have never been ignored in a restaurant before but now, based on the reviews, I'm glad we didn't waste money on the food."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I literally came here by accident one night not realizing that the old StonePepper's Grill that had previously been in this space had closed. We thought the menu looked expensive but were too tired to go elsewhere. I mention the prices specifically because this restaurant was charging prices in line with places like Il Pizzaiolo or Bistro 19 and delivering Olive Garden quality food and service. I ordered pizza and actually enjoyed it (no doubt the old wood-fired oven from StonePepper's has been put to good use). My girlfriend, however, ordered tortellini that she felt she could have cooked herself. She also ordered a glass of wine that didn't arrive until we had finished our meal. Our waiter was a nice guy but was either new on the job or lightly stoned: he never actually took a drink order, my girlfriend prompted him for the wine. Also, she was apparently supposed to get a salad with her tortellini but by the time we realized it we just didn't have the heart or energy left to bring it up. There is an Olive Garden 2 minutes up the road from here and a Bravo 2 minutes down the road and regardless of your feelings about those chains at least eating at the chains you can feel confident you will get what you pay for. There are plenty of far superior restaurants in the area at Pazzo's price point."}
{"text":"My wife and i went there for the first time on Saturday night, decided to sit at the bar. We waited for 5 to 10 minutes without being acknowledged by the bartenders, even though it wasn't very busy. When a bartender walked by us without even saying hello, we decided to get a table.

A waiter named Brandon took care of us, but his service was mediocre. He had to be reminded that we had ordered a second drink, the food was just warm, and not very good. (Chicken asiago and veal marsala) He never asked us if everything was ok after the food was delivered, didn't ask us if we wanted dessert or coffee, and didn't even say thank you after he returned the check after the payment was made.

Overall, we were very disappointed with our experience at pazzo. We will not return or recommend it to our friends. It was overpriced for the quality of the food and service. Olive garden would be a much better value."}
{"text":"Friendly, quiet, and the Italian food is quite good. Suggested: meatball pizza, fiery mule, stuffed banana pepper soup. Small places like this can use help from the community and the reviews can be misleading. Try it."}
{"text":"The wine selection was limited but of good quality.
The appetizer Arancini were good but seemed to just be a little bland the tomato sauce helped but it too needed more garlic.
My salad had too much vinegar and was drowning in it. 
The seafood Rollitini was ok but under seasoned.
The strawberry mascarpone cake, basically tiramisu with strawberries instead of chocolate, was just good not great. 

Service was ok but given the lack of a crowd should it should have been better.

It was not the best but far better than a chain store.
Would I go back probably yes at least one more time.

Suggestions to the owner.
1. Stop seasoning for old white people or at least offer to kick it up
2. Go to a team waiting model to give more attention to customers. 
3. Make us customers feel special not by cupon for free wine but giving a shit, talk to us treat us like we are honored guests.
4. Keep the seasonal menu going. 
5. Offer old fart seating at 4:00 to 5:00 \"give cupon for buy one pay 1/2 price for second \" you can offer the bland \"Special \" then."}
{"text":"So far all the reviews have nailed it- flavorless and cold food. Four of us sat down and ordered Cabernet. After a few minutes the waiter stopped by to have us remind him what beer we had ordered... We placed our order for food and he brought out a \"family style\" salad. Bad lettuce with a couple of poor cut onions slices. There was 4 of us and they served the table of 2 next to us the same salad. We asked for me and the snotty waiter slammed a bowl of just lettuce on the table a few minutes later. The funny part was they give you a gallon of dressing per person.. We decided that since it was the new place in town we would order a few apps so that we could try it out. But, using some caution we stuck to the basics -- Calamari and Fried Zucchini. Both were dripping grease and had zero flavor what so ever. Luckily I had lots of the Lemom Basil dressing left from my salad to give the Calamari the citrus it needed (never been served Calamari without a lemon to squeeze on top). The Zucchini was so soaked in grease none of us could eat it. They didn't clear off the table so at this point we are overloaded and there was no room for the bread that was brought to the table. Unfortunately we made room for it and it was the most stale bread I have ever had. Perhaps I was mistaken and they brough us croutons to go with our lettuce?
I'll wrap up with the entrees. I had ordered the \"lightly breaded\" veal chop with arugala and they served a disgusting piece of veal with a heavy and burned breading. No seasoning was involved. I opted for the starch and I was hoping it would be a pasta but instead if was a bowl of red skinned potatoes that had been given a butter bath. I literally poured the butter from the top before I could even tell what they had served me. I could have used these potatoes to apply wallpaper the place--gross. My wife was served cold, undercooked pasta and shrimp without any seasoning at all. It was supposed to be \"diablo\" but zero spice . She had two bites and was done. One guest ordered a side of chicken to go with his pasta and 5 minutes after his pasta was brought out they showed up with a bowl of shredded chicken.. a literal WTF moment.. The last meal was salmon and just to wrap this up was an awful piece of fish with no flavor -- same butter drenched gross potatoes..

We were honest with the waiter when he asked how everything was but he was more interested in being condescending in between smoke breaks. The manager does not have the skill level to deal with this type of complaint. She tried to make it better by taking the chicken off of the bill and offering a free desert.. And after all of this our bill was almost $200.... what a joke. I hope the place that goes in here next is better -- shouldn't be long."}
{"text":"We loved our experience here tonight.  Kim was our waitress and she was great.  Our children have an allergenic disease and are very limited in what they can eat.  I also have Celiac's disease, so no gluten for me.  Our meals came out just right, they made special accommodations for the kids and even had gluten free breadsticks they could eat.  You have now become one of our new favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"The food is very good. 
But...... Bartender charged for a double. Should have been 6.50 but they charged 13.00. When we mentioned we didn't order a double, she said it was a computer glitch, but made no effort to reduce it. Asked for a manager, he offered to take off 4.00. Buyer beware!! They are sneaky and when they get caught, they are unapologetic."}
{"text":"The worst dining experience I have ever had.  The food was decent, although some people in my party were unable to eat their's as it wasn't cooked thoroughly.  

It took an hour and 20 minutes for us to get our drinks.  When they first started bringing out the drinks, the waitress mentioned she had not yet placed our dinner order, which we had given her an hour before.  Someone from our group searched out the manager and found him in a back corner of the restaurant hanging out (turns out he is also the chef).  He basically ignored them.

There was much confusion, wrong drinks were brought out, not all appetizers were brought out.  At 9:00 (we got there at 6:30) we couldn't find our waitress to get our checks.  Finally at 9:30 she appeared with all single checks.  Not all checks were there, and she basically just put them on the hostess stand for us to sort through ourselves.  A member of our party had to search out the manager, who said he was just about to come over and see how our meal was.  We had no signs of him until we had to search for him.  

This was by far, the worst dining experience I've ever had.  Anytime I drive by, the parking lot is empty.   I can't imagine it will be open long.  If only the chef could back up his arrogance with his culinary skills."}
{"text":"If you're going to charge $16 for manicotti and a $2 up charge for the WAY too salty wedding soup, I expect more... I have no problem paying for good food and if this food had been amazing, I wouldn't even mention the cost, but it's far from that. I normally get manicotti at Italian restaurants my first time there and maybe if I'd done that, I'd like this place more, but I doubt it, since there was barely any sauce with my crab ravioli and I didn't like the flavor. I know many people like bell peppers, but I'm not a fan. If I order crab ravioli, I expect to be able to taste the crab - the consistency of the crab was also very strange - it was mushy. My dad's linguine with red clam sauce barely had any sauce and the sauce that was there was SUPER runny - it looked more like died white clam sauce than red clam sauce. At least they used real clams, but neither of us were impressed. I wish Stone Pepper Grill hadn't closed.

I'm REALLY not a fan of the Olive Garden, since there are so many better Italian places, but I think the food is better there, you get more, and it's certainly not as pricey... Of course, there are many much BETTER Italian restaurants than that (like Pasta Too, etc.), but if I'm saying the Olive Garden is a better choice, you know the food was not very good.

A couple more thing I forgot to mention in my review... I had to practically beg for parmesan cheese and what I got wasn't fresh or even nicely grated from a container... It was the same kind of parmesan I have at home (though probably not even Kraft... ha ha ha...) it was in a dish and they spooned it on for me. I didn't even get any to go with my soup, since I didn't want to ask for it then. No cheese was EVER offered.

They seem to turn their air conditioning completely off instead of down when the restaurant is closed, so it was INSANELY HOT in the restaurant until we were almost ready to leave (we went there for an early dinner, since I met my dad right after work to avoid traffic). Someone should explain to them that this actually costs them MORE money and it makes guests uncomfortable, so it's bad on all fronts. 

AVOID this place at all costs. Here's hoping they don't last long so a better restaurant can open there."}
{"text":"Save your $22+/ plate & take yourself over to Giant Eagle's Café. 

It took over 30 minutes for the food to arrive at our table. The portions were generous, however nothing was seasoned properly. Shrimp Scampi was covered in garlic powder sitting in a bowl filled with microwaved butter. The broccoli was the best part of my meal. They were cooked to perfection. The salad that's given lacked any dressing. The dressing was bland. The beer is over priced. $9 for any craft beer. I could see if they had a 10% DuClaw on draft for Pazzo's to have a reason to charge that much.

The service is depressing. Servers don't smile here or seem enthusiastic. Perhaps it's because they feel guilty for being the poor souls to serve below average food for such a sky-high price. 

The decor is nice. That's it. Now save yourself money and go to Chick-fil-A next door."}
{"text":"Just walked out of this place. Went in looked through the menu picked what we wanted and not once did anyone ask to seat us or even acknowledge that we were there. There was no hostess and a staff member out front on her phone & smoking that watched us walk in. There loss for shitty service. Never going there again."}
{"text":"The perfect word for this place is: bland. 

I had the eggplant Parmesan, which had too much breading & was bland.

Another person in our group had the Greek pizza, which was thin & crispy & bland. 

On the bright side (I guess), the kids liked their chicken fingers because, hey, kids like their food bland!"}
{"text":"Great food!  Thoroughly impressed with bolognese, manicotti, and veal.  Meatballs were soft and plenty of flavor. Sauce was a little too sweet for my liking, but still good. Service needs tightened up, but they're still new."}
{"text":"This restaurant looks lovely. There are beautiful paintings on the walls. The tables are set nicely. You are greeted kindly. The servers are very nice. The decor/environment and the service is the only reason I can give one star.  It was all downhill after that. 
I say all the time that of you can't get the basics right you can't get anything beyond the basics right. So we ordered two basic dishes-fettuccine Alfredo and Spaghetti & Meatballs. We chose to skip appetizers but a family style salad was brought to out table. It included a few cucumbers, a few grape tomatoes, some purple onions and a few croutons. There salad was cold but there was nothing memorable about it. We were also served 2 slices of bread. Again, nothing that stood out. 
The entrees were brought out while we were still eating our salad. It was awkward. When we went to eat our entrees they were room temperature. The meatballs were over cooked, dry, and didn't seem to have any seasoning. The spaghetti sauce tasted like tomatoes and not much else. I was extremely disappointed. I also tasted the fettuccine. It too lacked flavor.  The fettuccine noodles were inconsistent. Some were cooked to the correct consistency but some were hard. 
We skipped dessert because we didn't want to take the chance of eating anything else that lacked flavor. 
It's safe to say that there won't be a second visit."}
{"text":"I don't understand the 2 star reviews. Lunch today was very good, especially the thin crust pizza and the wedding soup was superb."}
