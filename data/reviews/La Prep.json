{"text":"Great food. Great service. Clean. And fair prices. Nothing more you can ask for. I had the caprese panini. Really tasty. Everything is made fresh."}
{"text":"The food is quite decent, but the prices are exorbitant.  $7-8 for a tasty, but small sandwich, and $3 for a slice of lemon cake?  Service is sub-par."}
{"text":"For airport food that isn't fried- this is a decent option."}
{"text":"This place is lacking in a lot of areas. The staff for the most part are not overly friendly. More importantly for what you get the cost is outrageous! 2 salads in a small square container that is not filled comes to approx. $9, a homemade lemonade that tastes so sweet it could have come from a can is $4. The last straw though, is that none of the sodas, juices or waters are kept very cold, if you ask for a glass with ice for your warm coke you are charged $0.45 - Never again!"}
{"text":"I stop here for breakfast once or twice a week. Always consistently good quality, good portions and very friendly service. Particularly like the Croissant and Panini breakfast sandwiches. Plus they always play good jazz."}
{"text":"I feel like it was just there because students had no choice but to buy a quick sandwich and run to their class, not saying that their sandwich are not good, they are normally fresh and delicious, the soups are really ordinary, but I find la prep just a bit overpriced, if the price was lower it would make the poor students' life like me much better:)"}
{"text":"The only thing decent here are the salads.  I have tried the sandwiches a few times, and every time they leave me feeling sick.  I have since learned my lesson.  La Prep - for the love of god please stop grilling your sandwiches, grilled, hot lettuce is terrible.   Pretty much everything is overpriced, but that is typical for campus food.  Coffee is meh for the price.  I haven't tried the desserts so I can't comment on those, but they do look good so I'll give them that.   Go here if they have the couscous salad that day, otherwise I would recommend skipping La Prep."}
{"text":"Commandé un wrap poulet et avocat.   Je m'attendais à trouver du poulet et des avocats, mais j'ai eu droit a un wrap salade et mayonaise.   J'ai pris la commande pour emporter au bureau. Je n'ai pas pu retourner la marchandise mais la situation l'aurait requis."}
{"text":"Due to convenience of where it is located, I have become a regular for breakfast and occasionally lunch.  Nestled at the corner of University and Wellington in an office building, La Prep (formerly Cafe Supreme) has very fresh premium tasting breakfast and lunches.  I've had their english muffin with tomatoe, cheese and ham breakfast sandwich, their croissant with spinach, cheese and ham, and their bacon and cheese panini.  All very delicious...served hot and their eggs are microwaved in a non-plastic container so they are safer.  You get a discount on the coffee if you buy it with the breakfast sandwich as a package. Price ranges for the package deal from 4.75 to 5.75.  As for lunch, they serve a variety of sandwiches (approx. $5-$7) and if purchased with two salads, the cost goest to $10. Their soups are good but nothing to write home about.  Everything tastes fresh and the ingredients are of premium quality. It is a little more pricey than other places, but you get what you pay for. Their coffee I find is weak compared to Second Cup or Starbucks, but they do have very aromatic flavors such as French Vanilla.  Their lattees are also ok.  Their cookies are very delicious...homemade tasting and melts in your mouth. But pricey at $1+ for a small one.  As for the service, I have found it to be slower than McDonalds, Bagel Stop, or Tims but staff is friendly and location is on my way to work, so convenient, which is great in cold winter weathers.  Their seating area is very clean and comfortable...inviting. Great for informal business meetings or for coffee with friends."}
{"text":"Save it for coffee or tea. It's incredibly overpriced but I've ended up here a few times due to desperation since it's in my building. On several occasions the food I bought was stale or just plain bad, and on one occasion it made me ill immediately after. Avoid if you can."}
{"text":"The staff is very rude, the food and coffee are overpriced and poor quality. Something better will open across the street soon enough."}
{"text":"I ordered and paid for a turkey\" avocado\" wrap that didn't have any avocado in it. When I brought it back the woman told me the avocado must be tucked deep inside even though the wrap was cut down the center. Rather than continue to argue I just ate it. There wasn't even one thin sliver of avocado in that whole thing. Either I was just lied to and ripped off or someone mistook cucumbers for avocado. Waste of $6."}
{"text":"Dreadfully expensive, mediocre food and service. The most obvious money grab ever, beware.  Food there was nothing special, would only visit as last resort."}
{"text":"Lines move quickly here and staff are okay.  It's generally quite busy around lunchtime so they try to move the line along.  It helps to know what you want to order prior to getting in line.   Panini's are  good and the salads are okay too."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times on the last 2 weeks. I've enjoyed all the sandwiches I had so far. The staff are efficient and polite. Premises are clean. I love the decor and the outside sitting area. It's a pity all the young guys with the navy blue tops, hanging outside and been loud. Iit takes the chic factor away. A sandwich with ciabatta bread just over $7 and full of flavour!"}
{"text":"Came here to get a smoothie once. I ordered from here because the booster juice was having a debit machine issue. I ordered a strawberry smoothie. How hard could it be, right? The \"juice\" that they used was old and sour. I wish I had tasted it before I left because it tasted rotten! I was in disbelief. I tweeted my unhappiness which is something I rarely do. I got a response right away, a totally RUDE response. I said that I had the worst smoothie ever. They said \"probably wasn't as bad as a root canal\". Bad smoothie. Bad customer service. Never again."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious English muffin while reading today's paper. Great corner view, very friendly staff, definitely recommend trying this cafe."}
{"text":"This la prep was a le gourmand for as long as I can remember. I was not the hugest fan of le gourmand, but the cookies and pastries were really good. La Prep picks up where le gourmand left off, without the lovely made-in-house pastries.   Still far too expensive, but the coffee is alright. My real issue with my la prep debut was the speed of service. With SIX employees in sight, and THREE customers my breakfast sandwich still took FIFTEEN minutes to receive after ordering. Everyone was taking their sweet time. And while it was good in the end and all, this is Yonge & Bloor. My coworkers and I had 20 minutes to grab a bite or coffee between meetings. For this location, you have to be faster, on the ball a bit. Le gourmand was excellent at this. I likely won't return any time I am in a hurry."}
{"text":"From a boring outdated look, this place has transformed into an uber chic place at 40 University ave.  The owner is very customer driven and you can see that the staff has been well trained. I love the food here, go there at least once a day. Healthy choices is what I like, and it is all fresh you can see the team preparing it on site."}
{"text":"Healthy, tasty, speedy :) You can also have fresh fruit juice. ?????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Very modern and sleek place to get a coffee, sandwich, salad, or baked goodie.  They're pretty close to being the ONLY place in the immediate area to find a quick coffee, and they know it.  So be prepared to pay TOP PRICE for a quite average lunch/coffee.  -- Their sandwiches include a LOT of pesto.  And by a LOT, I mean you get a hint of meat and veggies in every mouthful of pesto.  DO NOT get their Baked Pita Chips.  They taste like burnt bacon."}
{"text":"I used to visit here every morning on my way to work to get decaf coffee ( I know, I know) and something eat. Then they hired someone new to replace the person that handled the cash and mostly made the coffee. Since then, I just couldn't go anymore.  Today, after almost 6 months I went back and it was worse than ever before. I asked for the decaf, he didn't ask me if I wanted milk or anything, and although I prefer milk, I'm ok with black cause I can just add the milk at work. He started making it, but then got distracted so another person took over. She asked me what kind of milk I wanted, and when I told her he didn't mention that, she said \"it's ok, it comes with it\". So I told her almond milk and thought that was actually nice. Until he saw her warming it up, he got incredibly upset with me, told her to stop with the milk and poured a ton of hot water in my cup. He then said to me that next time I want milk, I tell him so I can pay for it, making me seem like I was trying to pull one on him. I told him he was rude, grabbed my drink and after two sips threw it away because he put so much water that it tasted like hot water with splash of coffee, it was disgusting. I also found out that some of my colleagues had stopped going there once he was running the front, as they noticed he was taking their cash and placing it in the register, but not actually ringing it up.  So be warned, the man in the front is incredibly rude, incompetent, and will ruin your first coffee of the day."}
{"text":"It's a nice cafe that has a variety of foods. The music here is really cool, which makes me appreciate this place a lot.   I ordered the roast beef sandwich with sautéed mushrooms and it was actually really good. I highly recommend this.   On the side I ordered the beef barley soup. This was average. On top of that, it was too hot so it took a while for me to even begin to eat it. The fact that it was really hot outside didn't help either.   Cool place."}
{"text":"This place is the worst for multiple reasons. The food is mediocre and overpriced. The chicken tastes off and like it was boiled.   My biggest complaint is the service. They gave me a coffee card, real great, right? Buy 10 get one free. The card does not specify any kind of conditions other than \"purchase 10 coffees and receive a free 12oz espresso-based beverage of your choice. Cannot be combined with other offers, valid at participating locations only.\"  I bought my 10th drink which was an iced Americano-- I had received a stamp for this drink on two previous occasions before. All the other times I bought regular double Americanos and also received my stamp. On this occasion the owner/manager says \"we only stamp for HOT drinks only...\"   The customer beside me scoffed in disbelief and we shared a \"what the heck...?\" moment. I was also confused-- because it's WATER, cold or hot, the state of matter should NOT affect the outcome of my complimentary stamp! It's a damn coffee! In fact, I paid more for the large in this situation- a large iced Americano! I'm a paying customer who has been returning out of convenience. STAMP THE CARD AND DONT NICKEL AND DIME PEOPLE! Do NOT try to make up conditions which are not clearly stated on the card OR anywhere else in the establishment! Learn how to treat your customers with respect! The little things go a long way!   I shared my story with my entire office. Why? Because it is RIDICULOUS. Coffee IS COFEE! Unbelievable!   UPDATE:   I went back to collect my \"free 12oz espresso-based beverage of my choice,\" because I bought the hot americano because I'm a sucker for punishment and enjoy receiving terrible garbage service! The manager was SO RUDE! I asked for an 12oz iced americano- she stated it was \"company policy that free beverages are hot.\" I told her that NOWHERE on the card did it specify this and that it was ridiculous. She advised me she'd make an exception and then gave me a regular black coffee over ice-- not even the americano I requested. She had the nerve to say \"sir, you forgot your card!\" -- guess what? I threw it in the trash where it belongs!   I'll be writing a formal letter of complaint.   I will NEVER be RETURNING!   UPDATE:  STILL HAVE NOT RETURNED. THIS PLACE IS THE WORST!"}
{"text":"Simple, convenient and well managed. The service here is excellent and the food is a definite step above the Timmies across the street. Unfortunately that comes at a cost, and that is price. Look to spend more on the morning \"staples\" than you would have thought to.  The paninis are very well done. They are rubbed with a little butter before they are placed in the press and warmed to perfection. A strong, rotating selection of side salads are a fantastic addition to the sandwiches or by themselves. One of my personal favorites: the Thai red curry soup."}
{"text":"I was in this building for a meeting around lunchtime today and I didn't feel like any of the foodcourt offerings. La Prep is quiet and it's away from the foodcourt so it's nice to feel like you don't have to mingle with the riff-raff.   I ordered the chipotle mango chicken pita which had a few small pieces of chicken breast scattered on the pita with a light glaze-like sauce (I didn't really detect much heat so I'm not sure where exactly the chipotle is hiding) with peppers and a couple scant pieces of  mango. This sandwich is not large and it's not particularly filled with either chicken or veggies so I would suggest you bulk up your meal with the salad option. You're allowed to choose two salads and you probably get about 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup of each selection, so it's pretty filling depending on your choices.  I selected the chickpea salad, which is dressed simply but deliciously with parsley and lemon juice, and the potato salad which appears to be pieces of cold, skin-on baked potato lightly dressed in mayo and seasonings. Both salads were fresh and tasty.   I also had a lemonade which was tart and refreshing. My meal ran me about 15 dollars. Yes, it's pretty high for what is essentially higher end foodcourt food, but honestly I've paid more for worse in restaurants so I enjoyed it and thought it was worth the splurge."}
{"text":"Really really good food! The ramen bowl is amazing! I haven't had good ramen like this in ages. So is their beef noodles! It's also in a nice quiet spot in the mall when compared to the food court. They also do bubble tea if that's your thing. Service is nice and quick. Friendly folk here."}
{"text":"While this is one of the better options here at first blush, the food is amazingly tasteless. An entire bowl of soup that had no flavour whatsoever. This quite a feat because it had coconut milk, chicken and mushrooms in it. Also it is very annoying that when you get something to go they do not add utensils and napkins (which would have come in handy since I spilled the soup in my lap)."}
{"text":"I agree with other reviewers - I only come here because of close proximity to work and it's a fairly healthy alternative to food court meals.  Positives:  - I really like their Chicken and Avocado wrap as well as their grilled flat breads.  That's about it for the positives - the not so good:  - Expensive. For a wrap that's almost 8 bucks.  - Yeah, service does suck, but I'm not here for that. However, sometimes I don't want to see a sour face. I say my please and thank you's to which I get nothing but a \"HUH?!?\" \"HUH?!?\" every time I order.   And yet, I have come here quite often. As I say, it's only close to work and the food (when heated) is quite good."}
{"text":"Today is a sad day. It was raining outside and I had no other choice but to eat at La Prep. I vow to never forget to bring my lunch again on rainy days, in order to boycott La Prep."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and testy! I tried their breakfast sandwich and as well I tried chipotle chicken pita which is awesome I love it!  Their customer service is so friendly and they always show hospitality to their customers."}
{"text":"I'm shocked at all the positive reviews for La Prep. Quality is clearly gone right out the window. Its ok, but really folks raise your bar a little. I do love the concept, it reminds me of a few of my favourite places in Hong Kong. Just not impressive, not fresh and not the quality of those places in Hong Kong. Freshness and quality are two words that don't belong in any description of this place. They do everything to make you feel like everything is fresh yet hardly anything is made on the premise. The eggs in the sandwich, cooked yesterday and shipped in. The bacon precooked off sit and re-heated. I don't know for sure but they must spray everything to keep it looking good like they do with airplane food. I know this sounds negative, I really don't mean to attack, I just want to make sure you know what you are getting as they have done well with the façade of fresh. I wish they would kick it up a notch. If McDonalds can use fresh eggs anyone can. This is one of those places that I hope no one sees me coming or going."}
{"text":"When you want the perception of fresh food fast this is the place to go. Nothing here is fresh or quality. They have mastered the perception of fresh. Almost everything is made off site or heavily preserved. The eggs are prepared in a factory sprayed with preservatives and shipped in pre-cooked like Starbucks and Tim Hortons (yuk). Bacon is pre-cooked who knows where and just reheated. For this reason I won't eat their egg sandwich's. MacDonald's actually uses fresh eggs and crack them. Most everything here is doused in chemicals. The main reason the average person is 20 lbs over weight is the chemicals in food and how it impacts the body and do we really need more chemicals in our bodies? My friend Jason referred me to this place. He works across the street and knows the area well. They have some \"fresh looking\" choices including fruit and vegetable salad all well displayed and at a reasonable prices. Today I had a fruit cup with cantaloupe, honey dew, pineapple and strawberries. Very refreshing and I believe no preservatives. I do like this place for the raw food, I won't touch the sandwiches or egg stuff.  The line here moves quickly stand back and look before you step in line."}
{"text":"Don't go there for breakfast. Specially, if you are looking for hot orders like omelettes or anything prepared with eggs. All \"La Prep\" restaurants are not equipped to deliver that service and they should not be allowed to deliver it. I can see the Bay St crowd does not discriminate against bad food; probably because everyone is in such a rush and they'll put anything in their mouth to kill hunger. The fact is that any egg prepared meal is nuked. We all know that eggs or any meats become rubberized after microwaved. The end result, disgusting taste. I do discriminate and I sent a complaint to LA PREP head office in Montreal, they said they looked into it but so far, it's been over 2 years.......  Stay away from their hot menu!  Thanks  L"}
{"text":"La prep is a common lunch spot in the downtown core \"Path\" underground walk way. I tried this place a  few times for lunch and was disappointed each time.  They specialize in sandwich and salad combo's. You can pick from about  6-9 daily salads but they are all soaked in some kind of dressing or mayo. Just feels so unhealthy after eating it.  The sandwiches are all pre-made which is disappointing, your stuck with all the sandwich dressings or sauces. I just want a simple healthy sandwich. Once you pick your sandwich, they will put it in a panini grill.  The sandwich meats taste like they were frozen and processed. Also tastes salty.  I must admit they do have a good breakfast yogurt with fruit in the mornings.   Many better quick lunch spots in the area...  BK"}
{"text":"This location is great. Very friendly service. And the lunch specials are perfect for a quick bite or take out. Brewed coffee is pretty standard quality. My favourite thing here is there grilled paninis."}
{"text":"only hipsters eat here lol organic water 10$ wtf nigha  so so so hipster like wow wowowoowowowoowow"}
{"text":"I come about once a week for lunch here. Fast service and friendly people. Sandwiches are always good. Never had anything to complain about here."}
{"text":"Nice little place for a quick breakfast. Everything looks freshly made and deliciously presented."}
{"text":"Had both breakfast and lunch at this place today - i am impressed with the variety, freshness and quality of the food.   I work in the building and we had a building Christmas bfast today at La Prep!! This is probably the 2nd time i had something at La Prep and that's because i usually get my lunch from home.  I really liked the breakfast this morning - it was fresh and there was a lot of variety - scrambled eggs, bacon, breads, chicken rolls, fresh fruits and the usual - coffee and juices. I spoke to one of the onwers (a lady) and complimented her on the taste and freshness of the food. She told me \"We got in at 4am today to cook all the food fresh for the customers\". Thats the kind of commitment we need from the restaurant owners!!  I was so impressed i went back for lunch and picked up a Chicken Pesto Panini. Again was delighted with the taste and quality of the food. Inspite of the rush and chaos of the lunch hour the service was great and i got my panini in around 2 mins. I love what they have done with the place and the fact that it has so much open space to sit down and eat. I was told they are re-doing the place this winter and look forward to visiting the location in Jan.   I would strongly recommend this place for anyone looking to get fresh, quality food for lunch!! Koodos to the La prep team!"}
{"text":"This location is very inconsistent as there are few options in the area leading to hangry desperation. The food is always of varying quality so some days, it may taste great, other days, you know the offerings are a day or two old. Wraps can be made full of ingredients some days, soggy and missing listed ingredients on others. You may get a thick, flavourful soup one day, to find it's been watered down to the consistency of hot milk the next. One day a pasta salad may have tons of fresh flavour, other days, the pasta may be stale or the salad itself is mostly all red onion or canned black olive. Classic sandwiches some days have a crust on the outside of their fillings, like the filling had been exposed to air for too long. Most of the staff tries their best and are really nice but tend to be inattentive as other reviewers have mentioned, frequently making sandwiches with their backs to the counter. Today's wrap I received was missing the feta listed on the ingredient card and was mostly tortilla with an unknown liquid. I suspect the liquid was likely the ghost of the feta that was supposed to be in the wrap, and some of the liquid from the two artichoke hearts tucked away in there. It tasted fine but for $7.67 I really expected better. And no, you can't return things even if they are made incorrectly. Staff will ask you what they are supposed to do, or tell you to pick something off if they included it by mistake."}
{"text":"Not good.  Cole slaw salad and green bean salads were both meh.  Both could have used a bit more flavour and the Cole slaw could have been less soggy.  But the thing that was most notable was the cream of mushroom soup. It tasted like starch and nothing but. A spoon stood straight up in it. A fork, heavy-end up also stood up without falling over.  I felt like I should be using this stuff for.a grade school art project.  Yuck!  Not coming back, ever."}
{"text":"If I could give this less than one star I would. The absolute worst. Literally would rather starve than eat this overpriced dirt."}
{"text":"Airport quality for airport prices, all without the excitement of a trip!  Nearly everything is made offsite, including the sandwiches, which makes customizing (say, for food allergies) very difficult. Despite this, they do great business since they're literally the only place to get food in this building. The salads are fine, but I have yet to try any main as they generally all have dairy in them. I had a soup once and it was really watery.   Prices are kind of high for the quality/quantity.   Personally, this is an emergency/crappy weather level place for me."}
{"text":"As usual I was getting lost in the PATH on the way to work, and I was starving at this point.  I saw La Prep, after passing many more like Druxy's, generic breakfast deals etc.  I have to say for $3.99 2 eggs, toast, sausage is good value.   I do not like the fact it is on plastic plates but whatever, I guess the non - PATH, dine in La Prep's are better in that regard.  The service was quick and friendly. The juice looks great here as it is fresh squeezed, will try it next time.   I think for  a quick bite on the way to work, this works."}
{"text":"Good option in the Markham business complex. Very friendly staff, and their food options are good, but can deplete quickly due to demand. The duo and trio salad options are great choices if you want a bit more but want some variety.  Prices are a bit higher, but are a easy, quick, tasty option in the building."}
{"text":"Nino will make you the best coffee in town as it always comes with a smile and story whether this is Americano, latte or something special that you like. Excellent sandwiches made fresh daily. If you ride your bikes in the area you must visit and enjoy a drink or one of the healthiest salads from the rich salad bar to gain energy for your ride. Great places to grab a bite at lunch. Always fresh and tasty due to the personal touch of Nino and the regular staff. Open from 7am to 6pm."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I had pasta with pesto with pine nuts. We all know that pine aren't cheap and they don't skimp on them either. The pasta was scrumptious and I had it with ham and cheese stuffed chicken, which was good, too.   Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"New and shiny cafe. I think it replaced a Tea Masters which was starting to look dowdy.  I've lunched here a few times the sandwiches are pretty standard as well as the salads and soups.  Basic lunch fair you can't go wrong.  Roast beef and mushroom pita is tasty but costs $6.00 and doesn't include a side--on its own it isn't very filling you get about two slices of deli roast beef and a slice of cheese with sautéed mushrooms.  To add a soup or salad is an extra $2.74. Prices seem on par with  Pumpernickels restaurant which is in the next building to this place and is constantly packed at lunch times--La Prep is not so much which is convenient when looking for a place to avoid the lunch crowd.  Pumpernickels has a larger menu but La Prep does the basics well and have much friendlier staff."}
{"text":"La Prep is what I consider a \"premium\" fast food chain.  Their breakfast is better than Timmy's, Starbucks, etc, but it doesn't hold a candle to even Sunset Grill or the independent breakfast shops.    Why you should come here: -Quick breakfast -Breakfast bagel with pesto mayo -Breakfast panini -Quick lunch combos (salad +sandwich)  Why you shouldn't come here: -You want super super cheap food -Faux Pho (seriously - they offer that, no idea what they were thinking)  Verdict: Decent quick lunch option if you are in the area, but nothing special."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for flavorful coffee. Reasonable prices. Buy 10 get 1 free. Almond milk available upon request. Plenty of seats. Friendly staff. Food wise nothing is vegan and since everything is pre-made you can't custom order / veganize anything."}
{"text":"Had a hard time reaching anyone regarding my online e-catering order. Left voicemails, emails, and sent a question to their website on Thursday. Didnt hear anything by Monday lunch so I called the store I requested to fill the order. It was a pretty nerve wracking experience and then on the 4th day of deliveries they completely lost our order for breakfast.  The delivery was a failure in terms of customer service and quality. Instructor and customer were both unimpressed with the breakfast and deliveries were substantially late everyday making it very hard for our staff. Unfortunately we won't be using la prep for any future e-catering in the Toronto area until some of these major things can be resolved."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick drink because I didn't want to wait in line for the booster juice next door. I ordered their frozen matcha drink, the drink that was featured outside the door on a big banner. When I went in I was confused where to order, I stayed in line and was approached quickly only to be told that I just need to go to the register to order my drink. So I go and I told the girl I wanted a frozen matcha and she had no idea what I was talking about, she thought I meant frozen mocha. I told her no...the drink on your banner the green tea matcha..then another lady came over asking what my order was. She also thought I meant mocha. After a bit of back and forth we got the order right. Not sure if they just couldn't hear me or they don't know their products.   The order was made quickly. The drink had a nice matcha taste but not too powerful kinda on the light side. They added some kind of sugar in there. It was heavy on the ice sadly. I don't think I would order that again. For a small frozen matcha it came up to be $4.08 I rather use that towards a small booster juice. Sigh I wanted to like this drink."}
{"text":"Super fresh sandwhiches. Good prices.   Coffee is great as well.   Flavoured coffee isn't weak and artificial tasting like all others.  Love the banana muffins...tastes like homemade banana bread.  A great place for a quick lunch. Usually hit this place up once or twice a week. 4-5 times for coffee and a muffin."}
{"text":"I work in this building and have breakfast here once or twice a week.  I love their breakfast and coffee, but not so much the lunches.    It's a better option than Tim's across the street, but it's also a bit pricier.  One thing I really love here (and this will sound funny) is their pesto mayo.  It's green because of the pesto colour, but it is so friggin good!  Get a breakfast bagel or breakfast paninni with pesto mayo and bacon/or sausage with a coffee and you'll definitely be full until just after lunch.    Also, the owner and the servers are really nice and kind here too."}
{"text":"Great place to grab lunch for work. I usually bring the food back to office. Had a smoked salmon pita and then a tuna wrap on separate occasions. It was OK, decently fresh and not too salty. The combo comes with 2 salads. The sit down area is clean, but hard to have a conversation cause of all the people traffic."}
{"text":"Veggie Lasagna $7 - It was fresh and tasty, but left me wanting more.  This is a cute fast-service restaurant.  You place your order by the counter and then pay at the cashier.  All the walls are glass so it provides an open air feeling.  This La Prep is located inside an office building, but can easily be seen from the street.  There are usually plenty of seating inside the restaurant even though there aren't that many tables.  It's probably because most people take their food to go.  Besides the veggie lasagna, they also offer panini, sandwiches, salads, pastries, etc.  The food here is always taste fresh and healthy.  I tried their large oatmeal cookie and it was good, but nothing memorable."}
{"text":"Apparently there are 2 La Prep on the same street.  I went to the 1 Queen St E, not 2 Queen St E."}
{"text":"visually when you walk by uts quite appealing.  everything looks fresh and the sandwhiches and oaninis look like something youd like to order.  however taste wise my coworker and i found it to be mediocre and bland.  doesnt hit the spot in terms of quality.  i have been here a few times and although it makes me want to like it and try it again its just decent and not abything remotely special.  unfortunately."}
{"text":"I came here because I was asked to drop a friend off at the airport and she wanted a cafe type place for a bite.   It shares the same building structure as a kabab joint, a subway and a strip club (did not know until I was trying to check in on Path and it showed up, I thought it was like a gym). Walking into this place, it looked very crisp and clean, it felt very refreshing.  We arrived at around 3ish on a weekday, and we were one of three parties to visit this this place for an hour. Sandwiches, salads and desserts are displayed in a glass case, makes me want to eat them all, they all look so nice! But I didn't get anything because I wasn't hungry, I enjoyed a tea while my friend ate a pita sandwich and a \"pho\" noodle soup. I put pho in quotes because it wasn't pho. It was a bowl of soup with various diced up vegetables, served with thin rice noodle, almost the same thickness of angel hair pasta, also served with dill. Yeah, dill. In a bowl of \"pho\".   Service staff were friendly and the place is clean, the toilets were enjoyable as well. It's not too busy, so I'd reckon it'd be a nice place for a nice catch up if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Only La Prep in this area. Food is definitely great and service is commendable.  Breakfast is recommended and espresso served well. Always try the Panini for lunch. Also look for different possible combos that they have, definitely great save."}
{"text":"Croyez le ou non, mais ce petit la Prep tenu par une charmante famille d'origine libanaise, a le meilleur latte de Montréal !!!!  La nourriture y est également très bonne; mes préférences vont à la salade Fatoush (avec une pointe de cannelle), au grilled cheese qui est à tomber, à la salade tendance thaï pour l'été et au egg-bacon muffin du matin.  Les prix, pour le quartier, sont plus que raisonnables et l'accueil est toujours super !  Pourtant installé dans l'immeuble Québecor, toujours bondé, on ne fait jamais très longtemps (10 minutes grand max en plein rush), les produits sont toujours frais et il y a souvent des nouveautés.   Un grand oui à La Prep St-Jacques !!!!"}
{"text":"My wife begrudgingly dragged me in here while we were shopping in the mall.  Honestly, I just wanted to get on the road back to Edmonton and to the Donut Mill.  BUT I am so glad we stopped here.  The lime mojito slush was heavenly and the mocha was out of this world.  There really are no words in the English language to adequately describe the perfection of our beverages.  So I'll say it in French...  Viva La Prep!"}
{"text":"I'm not usually the type to eat in food courts. I'm not sure what it is but they just don't appeal to me. However, in an effort of finding something new for lunch I ended up here for a panini and have to say it was surprisingly good!  I had the chicken and bacon panini and for $6 it was just the right amount of food to go back to work fulfilled. They also have a large selection of grain, bean, or pasta salads... But I'm not really a salad guy so can't comment on that side of things.   All in all, highly recommendable, even if it is in a food court."}
{"text":"A perfectly fine lunch option in an area of minimal good options. This place is actually a small jaunt through the Sun Life Financial building and a little past the actual food court. It has its own seating area which is nice to be away from the food court masses.  Both times I've come the salad options were pretty lackluster in both flavour and selection (especially compared to what I remember from other other locations), which is why I'm not really excited about this place. The thing is that just getting a wrap or sandwich on its own isn't the most filling lunch. That said the wraps, pitas, and sandwiches do taste good. So yeah, it's A-OK by Yelp standards."}
{"text":"We had a catered lunch from them a while back which was delicious.  And now this place has become my weekly (if not daily) habit.  The food tastes fresh and and it's consistently on point.  The sandwich and salad combos are a good deal.  4 stars for the food.  Extra star for the good service."}
{"text":"The only thing that would make this place perfect is calories on the menu.  There is SO many fresh sandwiches, soups and salads.  The dessert bar is always fully stocked to compliment your healthy meal.  Lots of drink choices too.  Many different seating options so great for small or large lunch dates.  There really are few options in this area, so this place is great with free parking too.  Good prices, and very fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Great healthy place for lunch!  I usually order the chicken and brie flat bread with two side salads.  They grill the sandwich and its so delicious!  I love that they have a different selection of side salads to choose from everyday as well.  They have garden salads, veggies, pasta salads, etc.    They also have fresh squeezed juices.  I've tried their passion fruit and kale juice and I love it!  It tastes great and its healthy for you at the same time.  I've also tried their beet juice which I didn't like quite a much.  They are fast since everything is already made ahead of time and just grilled, etc.  Good for lunch breaks at work."}
{"text":"The coffee is good here for breakfast and the sandwiches are good at lunch, but the service is only average.  I agree with Jennifer, they need to pick up the pace! Sometimes I wait in the morning to order my latte while one girl works the cash AND makes the coffees, another is on the other side making sandwiches for lunch, and at least one other person is talking on her cell phone. Prioritize, people! The customers in front of you are the only thing you should focus on!  Lunchtime they are pretty good and the selection is right. They do like to toast all the sandwiches, which is what tends to take the longest. Don't let them fool you, though. When you order a sandwich and they respond, \"what kind of salad would you like with that?\" it's not because a salad comes with it. They are rather sneakily upselling you - the salad is at least $2 more, maybe $2.50. Just a warning.  Still, the lattes are good. I've had a chicken avocado wrap and a couple of other sandwiches and the ingredients are fresh and the bread is delicious."}
{"text":"The food here tastes good, and there are reasonably healthy options available.  I usually get a panini - today it was chicken and vegetables.  For a few dollars more, you can get two sides.  I ordered two salads on this particular visit.  The total cost with tax was $8 or $9.  Generally, the dishes are consistent.  I know what I'm getting as far as food is concerned.  Where I have a problem is the service.  Many of the staff have extreme language barriers.  Most of the ones that we interact with speak very little English.  The best you can do is point and repeat yourself over and over again - and then over and over again some more.  Unfortunately, they don't seem to understand hand gestures either.  Today I was there with some coworkers and noticed that the people who ordered the same thing just before me had their food already.  I looked around and saw my order ready behind the counter.  I had already paid. I told the person behind the counter that the food sitting their was mine.  Then I did that again about 5 more times, with 3 different La Prep employees.  Some of my coworkers chimed in, along with strangers, trying to get them to simply hand me my food.  The staff would look down at the food, then just stare at us.  It was bizarre.  Eventually I said \"I'll try one more time, then I'm reaching over and taking it\".  We tried 3-4 more times, then I reached over the counter and took my food, and left.  On previous visits I've seen people go through trials just to buy a few croissants.  It's not ideal to have customer-facing employees who don't understand the customers."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for grilled cheese especially ones with not the usual run of the mill cheeses. I tried La Prep's Gruyere, Swiss, Green apple and sage Sammie. Cost: $6.38. For that you get sparsely sliced apples i think 4 in total, with a nice hearty bread and the stated cheese nicely melted. However there is no sign of the sage which i was looking fwd to tasting its contribution and the measly apples turned me off.  Verdict: Expensive, measly, Not recommended for the grilled cheese. Staff is nice and attentive though."}
{"text":"Well, when you're in a rush at the airport and your options are Subway, Sbarro, and greasy chinese food, La Prep looks great. They have a number of sandwiches, salads, and other more healthy and less processed-looking items.  I just wish they made sandwiches to order.."}
{"text":"Spacious breakfast/lunch spot with modern and clean interior that has lots of seating inside and outside on a large terrace. It is a prime location as right by Place des Arts metro station and close to many office buildings.   Our company frequently orders from here during lunch meetings - the lunchboxes are pretty good and very filling. They usually come with a sandwich/panini of some type (I love the ciabatta ones), choice of soup or salads and choice of cookie. The salads are delicious and very fresh. They come packed in La Prep boxes which are very handy, especially for take-out or catered lunches.  I am not too impressed by the inside choices/prices however. They have a very large place with not much variety on their menu and the selection seems basic. I found them a little on the pricier side for what you get. For breakfast or lunch, there are much more nicer options in the area."}
{"text":"The only reason as to why I would come here is due to its close proximity in my building.  Other than that La Prep is NOT BAD....This place is known for its sandwiches and salads, however for coffee, I would rate it a mediocre 3 out of 5 based on the last few times I've been here.  The people running this place are very fast, friendly, and accomdating. Their prices are fair, and the clientele, especially the REGULARS know what they want, and know what's good.  However I've seen their sandwiches are usually pre-made which made me question their freshness, don't sandwich places usually let you choose your ingredients rather than just having no choice? hmmm.. but long story short this place is okay, nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Staff are frequently slow and inattentive. Will rarely take an addition order while another one is being made. They usually make sandwiches with their back turned on the counter so waiting a bit to even be acknowledged isn't uncommon. Also way over priced. I wish there were more options open early in the morning."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in the fruit smoothie which was full of sugar. Food in the showcase kinda looked old. Not impressed."}
{"text":"La Prep is a decent lunch spot in the food court under The Bay at Yonge and Bloor. The food is good, some of it really good.  The downside to this place is that there's a strong likelihood there wll be a problem with your order. I went five times and had a problem four out of the four times I went. They gave me the wrong sandwich, or the wrong salad, or gave me a salad when I hadn't asked for one, or the food was cold. There seems to be poor communication between the staff members.  The problems are getting better, and I'll look at updating my review when the accuracy of the orders becomes a little more consistent."}
{"text":"Good food, slightly pricey (compare it to slightly less than starbucks prices but more than tim hortons).. Decent atmosphere, comfortable seating.. I really like their coffees.. They also have fresh fruit, yogurt and parfaits which are quite nice. Sandwiches are nice but expensive and not very filling. Overall everything is pretty healthy and tasty. Areas of improvement : Salads could be better, unfortunately they also got rid of egg whites as an option which was great for the health conscious folks. Cookies and snacks aren't bad. Service can be slow. Staff is usually pretty friendly."}
{"text":"I wish there were more of these coffee shops because I thing this place makes the best chi tea latte!  Every time I find my self out at cross-iron mall I got right to la prep and make my regular order.   Just talking about I want one and a cookie"}
{"text":"A great choice of sandwiches and salads, as well as other food items such as quiche.  The other day I got a prosciutto panini with mozzarella and spinach and some spread.  I added 2 salads - the spinach walnut and strawberry, and the corn and black bean salad.  Everything tasted amazing.  All of that was about $10.  Not too shabby.    The place is a bit small and I feel a bit rushed to make a decision when I come during the week.  It's to be expected downtown I guess.    In the summer they have a lot of outside seating to people watch while you enjoy your lunch in the sun."}
{"text":"Great paninis. Lasagna like an Italian restaurant. Nice clean place w very friendly workers."}
{"text":"The staff is nice and attentive and the restaurant itself is clean and tidy.  Personally I find La Prep to be somewhat overpriced but, eh, we live in a fast casual food world and this one is located in York University where the food seems to always be slightly more expensive or the portions slightly smaller than the same chain elsewhere.  I tried their croissant breakfast sandwich and was rather underwhelmed.  Let me say it was NOT bad, it just was not memorable or very filling, one could even say somewhat bland.  The croissant itself was really nice and flaky but was totally mangled by the sandwich making and wrapping process.  When I first unwrapped the sandwich I thought they had turned it into a burrito!  The egg was scaldingly hot but something in the sandwich was ice box freezing.  Don't know if it was the cheese or the ham (although if I had not read the menu I would not have been able to tell you that there was either cheese or ham in the sandwich from taste alone.  I know it was there because I saw it, it just added nothing to the flavour) but it made an unattractive contrast in your mouth with one bite searing the flesh off the roof of your mouth and the next one being the temperature of an ice cream cone.    I would go back for another croissant but JUST the croissant."}
{"text":"I go there often. The food is good, but nothing particular. Their pananis are often dry. When they say chicken and bacon, you literely get a piece of bread, bacon and chicken. And the bread gets dry and hard really quickly.   The salads are good, always too liquid for my tastes. The decor is nice, and it's pretty quick to just eat and go. If you are looking to fill your stomach, it's good, but don't expect too much. I suppose everything is fresh, bla bla bla, but the overall feeling is not that good, after eating there more than a couple of times.   I will go again because it's the restaurant near my bureau and i digg this kind of food more than burgers and fries, so that's a plus!"}
{"text":"Good fresh sandwiches. Combo with two salads and a drink for under $12 is not a bad deal. Arrive before noon as the food court is jammed by 1215 pm. Service is a bit slow. Coffee is hot, fresh and dark. They have espresso as well but I've never seen them make it."}
{"text":"A convenient location for a more healthy fresh meal on the run than the double arches down the road. I had the breakfast panini (2 eggs, cheddar cheese, bacon and mayo) for a late breakfast and found it really filling. It had all the advertised ingredients, was freshly toasted and delicious. The staff are obviously use to working efficiently, ringing in orders at one end while another staff prepared the orders. I was in and out in 20 minutes flat including the time it took to inhale half the sandwich.   There is a nice sitting space off to a side with some higher table-level seats and some lower armchair seats. Plenty of people holding impromptu business meetings over coffee and sandwiches. Will remember this place the next time I'm in a rush and looking for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for a couple of years. Their potato salad is awesome and their cafe mocha is simply perfect. Have seen this place transformed from a small place to a decent sit-in joint but the quality has never taken a hit.  Infact...i'm heading there now for a hot mocha :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food but consistantly forgetting our order and very slow and asking us what our order was. Wish it was better..."}
{"text":"Pros:  - friendly and personal service - wide variety of food (sandwiches, soup, smoothies, coffee- you name it, they have it) - quick service - cute indoor cafe ambiance and a soothing outdoor patio (with a garden)   Cons:  - no wifi  It was a refreshing change from all of the corporate buildings. I enjoyed a yummy soup (thai curry based) and peach smoothie here on a breezy summer day while sitting on the outdoor patio. The staff was very nice and friendly. Would I go back? Absolutely~"}
{"text":"Great breakfast sandwich and customer service, as they went out of there way to make a breakfast meal well after the breakfast hours were over!"}
{"text":"Woah, worse than I even imagined it.   I probably need to be even more picky when ordering any salmon product at restaurants.   I ordered: Wrap combo -smoked salmon with 2 side salads  Portion: salad is a lot, but the wrap was small with barely anything inside. I felt like I was eating just bread.  Cost: $10.18 + tax   Not worth it at all.   I hate writing bad reviews, but there was honestly nothing tasty or good about this item."}
{"text":"Love the banana muffins here... So moist with chunks of real banana inside The grilled veggies panini and the salami panini are both outta the world good! The  mojito smoothie is delicious and tastes refreshing and just like the real thing minus alcohol of course The parfait is satisfying, sweet and really good too.  The service is okay. Prices are kinda expensive but I come here mostly for convenience. Plus everything tastes good."}
{"text":"This is a decent lunch spot if you happen to be in the area and want something quick. Compared to other options in the immediate vicinity (Tim Horton's, Druxy's, Booster Juice, hospital cafeteria), La Prep is not a bad choice! It gets busy, but the lineups are never too long and service is efficient. The combos are a good choice - wrap/panini with soup or 2 side salads. I like the chicken avocado wrap, although was disappointed that there are no big pieces of avocado. There's just avocado flavoured mayo. The ham & brie panini is good. In general, the paninis are bigger and a lot more filling than the wraps. Salads are yummy! My favourite is the pasta salad - linguini with mushrooms (ask them to heat it up!). Not really a salad, it's more like a side dish. The mango salad with cucumbers and tomatoes is nice too. They carry Mighty Leaf teas here, another bonus! Lunch combos come up to around $8-9 with tax."}
{"text":"The only reason why you would eat at this location of La Prep is because you work in the office of the same building and you need to grab something really quickly so that you can get back to the grind.  This place is yet another reason for me to bring my own lunch.    The food is not so bad here, but the service is just horrible.  There are about 5 people working behind the counter and probably a few more in the kitchen and the line is just barely moving during the lunch hours.  The staff is not helpful and what's appalling is that they don't know what is in the grilled sandwiches and which one of their items are vegetarian.  Another reason why the line is barely moving is because there is only one cash register and the cashier is trying to figure out what you ordered more than half the time.  The system is just not efficient.  I also feel like I am taking a chance with the utensils, I sometimes see fruit flies flying around the area where they keep this stuff.  I'll likely still come back here for lunch when I am in a pinch and until I find a better place to go.  Their sandwiches and salads are good and I also like their toasted seasoned pita bread."}
{"text":"Situated within the brand new Corus Entertainment building on the lakefront, La Prep is a sleek-looking cafe that offers freshly-made sandwiches and salads. Considering there are few food options in this area, La Prep has secured itself to be a reliable spot for a coffee or a quick lunch.   Since I was working in the area, I came here to pick up a dual salad and it was a reasonably priced at $5.41 after tax. There are usually half a dozen cold salads available, including Asian noodle, a spring mixture of broccoli and cauliflower and spinach salad. I choose the Mexican corn salad and the tomato-feta penne. Both were excellent and lightly marinated, without leaving a greasy streak on the corners of your mouth. While I haven't tried the sandwiches here, the ones at the Harbourfront location are quite tasty and the bread is definitely fresh.  What I love about La Prep is the fact that the quality of ingredients are not sacrificed, and the service is fast. It's also an amazing spot, considering that Sugar Beach is still fairly secret and not many people bother to visit this end of the lakefront.   LOCATION: Just a 10-minute walk from Union Station."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today as I was working in the area; this La Prep location is in a small plaza with Subway and another store that sells pitas I believe.. right around many office buildings.   I was surprised to find a very clean interior with modern and cozy décor - there's a cute fireplace and a large marble table, a few couches by the windows - a good place to grab lunch or coffee.  There are plenty of two-seater tables and can get quite busy during the lunch rush from offices nearby.  The prices and portions are very reasonable, a sandwich/wrap with two salad sides (cold pasta, rice, potatoes, couscous, etc.) for ~$11! I highly recommend the chicken and brie sandwich!  There is also a variety of pastries/cakes from Dufflet along with croissants, muffins, coffee, espresso beverages and fresh juice!"}
{"text":"Found this little place on Friday.  I believe it's new because I haven't seen it before.  It's tucked away in the east foodcourt on the ground level - down from The Bay.  This place brings me back to FRANCE!  Fresh made sandwiches behind the glass and the options are endless.  They have mushroom paninis, baguettes with brie and ham, wraps, avocado sandwiches as well.   Im sure there are soups as well.  I was just blown away with the options. You can get a sandwich/wrap with 2 sides of salads.  Not plain salads either! Parisian apples, tuna pasta, bean salad.  I will definetely go there again - the good is not only good but healthy as well. As a bonus you can add a coffee for $1.  Everything is fresh and ready to go.  I will admit it's a little pricy for just a sandwich.  I had a Brie & ham baguette with 2 salads plus a coffee - came to roughly $10.  BUT in defence you get this nice stuff for the same money for a boring sub at Mr Sub or Subway.  I would pick this place over them anyday!   Give it a try Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Don't get in line immediately if you're indecisive; the staff here keep things moving at a good clip and you'll need to reassure them multiple times that you're still undecided.   This is the place to go when you want food fast, but not fast food. That said, they don't publish their nutritional information anywhere, so it's probably less healthy than I'd like it to be. Servings are not huge, but I suspect they dump oil on nearly all of their salads - you won't go hungry anytime soon if you get the combo with a sandwich. Everything I've ordered here tastes pretty good."}
{"text":"They burnt my panini because the girl put it on the grill and then went on break. I asked for a new one and they collectively lost their minds. I just wanted a panini y'all :("}
{"text":"This is a good and roomy café and sandwich shop above the PATH on King West. It is in the northernmost black tower adjacent to King Street across from First Canadian Place. The café has a view to the street or the courtyard from either end and is preferable to the confinement below it. Also, unlike the packed queues of McCafe and Starbucks below it they have room, available tables and comfy seats. What is with everyone lining up like sheep at McCafe and Starbucks anyway?? I have this feeling that people are robotically standing in line at McCafe because they hate ordering from a person and like touching the bacteria-laden touch screen. Anyway, I swear La Prep had the best hot chocolate I have had in the area.  They also have a collection of sandwiches and juice, which I will update on when I visit next. The girls at the counter were friendly and helpful and their washroom was clean."}
{"text":"I come here almost everyday because I like the food. BUT, the customer service is below standard.   The staff are always more focused on food prep for Togo orders than the customers right in front of them. If I am in a rush or pressed for time, I make sure to spend my money elsewhere.  The food is also quite expensive for a fast food place."}
{"text":"Nice place to chat with a friend. Modern and comfortable furniture: slab tables with stools, coffee tables with leather chairs, modern decor and big windows. Fairly cheap ($6 for avocado blt and coffee). Coffee was great, tomatoes in the blt were pretty gross but I was very hungry. Barely any avocado. But you're not really going here for a nice meal. Come grab a bite to get you by, or buy a coffee and stay a while. Yes, there is free wifi with YouTube quality speeds."}
{"text":"Disappointing food! I had a spinach quiche with 2 bland side salads. My father had a hot meal ($8.99) consisting of southwestern chicken and rice and a side soup. The soup was Canadian Pea soup ($2.99) and it must have been what was left in the bottom of the container as there were very few peas or meat.   My quiche had no taste and my latté was underwhelming although they do claim to by beans from sustainable farms.   Only good things were that they have free wifi for guests; quiet after the lunchtime rush; relatively clean wheelchair accessible bathroom (no key required); some comfy leather armchairs by the win do arranged in groups of 3; and lots of regular seating.  Would I recommend? No   Would I come again for lunch or coffee? No"}
{"text":"La Prep offers better tasting food than other food outlets on campus. However, it is quite pricey for student budget and quality has dropped a bit comparing to its opening Their sandwiches are great so if you happen to have department catering, go for La Prep food over Aramark. Their fruit juice are also delicious"}
{"text":"Got a pricey chicken quinoa salad here, it seemed a few days old, watery, improperly cooked quinoa, wilted greens, rubbery fake chicken and corn was in it (cheap low-quality). Won't be wasting my money again, gave heard similar stories from co-workers about other food here, but tried it anywAy. Too bad."}
{"text":"I just bought lunch from this La Prep location and was not at all impressed with the service that I received. The fact that they gave me the wrong sandwich is bad enough, but even more alarming is that it took 3 people over 10 minutes to figure out how to make a latte.  When they finally passed me my \"beverage\", they giggled and informed me that they actually had no idea how to make a latte.  Upon returning to my office, I discovered that it was completely undrinkable - absolutely disgusting.   I would suggest that this location should focus on their training of the equipment as they shouldn't be advertising that they sell lattes if they're actually not capable of making them correctly."}
{"text":"I buy my lunch here most days purely because it's right by my office.  Is it a little overpriced? Yes, but it's so fast, fresh and convenient that I turn a blind eye to that (also, in the Yorkville area? Let's face it - nothing is cheap).    I typically buy either a panini, salad, or (my personal favourite) the gourmet grilled cheese. If you are only going to try this place once, for the love of god - GET THE GRILLED CHEESE! It's got delicious gruyère and swiss cheese with apples and fresh sage. Just thinking about it is making my mouth water (yup - just decided what I'm having for lunch today!). They also have a wide selection of paninis and salads that are all pretty gosh darn tasty!   The only thing I'm not a huge fan of on the menu is the soup. It always sounds good, but all the flavours I've tried have been oversalted and kind of gruel like in texture... No thanks...  The staff at this location are very friendly and the service is speedy.  They do breakfast as well, but I never have my act together in the morning to have enough time to stop anywhere to grab grub.  Additionally, they have a wide selection of specialty coffees and teas, but I seldom go there for that.   There is another La Prep at the concourse level of 2 Bloor St E, but I always go to this one instead because there is hardly ever a line up."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a while. For campus standards, this place is awesome. You can come here purchase a snack/meal/coffee and study for a little while! It makes it easier that there are outlets everywhere.   The coffee is great, the food is great but the service can be hit and miss. Sometimes they may be a bit grumpy while at other times they are super friendly. Yes, its human nature, but in hospitality, always be friendly!   I enjoy their breakfast bagel and coffee. What makes it so good is their pesto mayo. Its always been a treat for me when I have had it in the morning. The bagel is $3.89 but for $1.45, you can add in a medium coffee. Not too too bad considering one of la preps big issues is their price to portion ratio. Its pretty high compared to other options on campus. Actually, nevermind, nothing is worse on price-portion ratio than marketplace ;)  Im giving 4 stars because they have the best coffee on campus. There is really nowhere else to get it..they also have a lot of good, healthy food. Downsides are high prices and that it can get really loud and busy."}
{"text":"Over a year ago, the company that employs me changed office locations. My colleagues and I decided to check out restaurants around the area. We found this gem less than a huge Mississauga block away from our office building.  The food never fails me. I love the sandwiches there (the roast beef and chicken are my favourites). I have a weakness for quiche, with the broccoli and ham varieties to be my go-to choices. I also love soup that you can get as a side with your meal. I love the beef and barley vegetable, and the minestrone soups.  The interior is cozy. There is a fireplace (think it's fake, but I could be wrong), a large marble table, a huge London-inspired round clock on the wall, and many tables and seats at the back of the restaurant.   I recently tried a mojito smoothie, which is wonderfully tart and made with almond milk. So good! If you need a pick-me-up and have to go back to the office with a non-alcoholic drink, try the mojito smoothie!"}
{"text":"I've tried a number of paninis here. They have been average. I wouldn't get Ham and Brie or Cajun Chicken again because both paninis were pretty bad. They were very dry and not very fresh. I liked their Sriracha Chicken and Chicken Pesto more. They seem to have a great selection of salads, yogurt and baked goods. They do have some selection of fancy-looking tea bags and flavoured coffee as well."}
{"text":"Given that there's not much variety in the area, I'm super happy to have La Prep in the vicinity. This place is similar to Java U, but with better food and better prices. Daily specials are available, but I'd recommend the sandwich/salad combo, which will run you just over $10."}
{"text":"very good ramen great noodles and love the smoothies very friendly service would recommend!!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan! La prep offers breakfast, sandwiches, sides, pastries,  coffees, teas and freshly squeezed drinks. They have a really addictive  breakfast sandwich with pesto mayonnaise. I love pesto mayonnaise! I'm going to have to start making it at home. I usually come here for fresh mango juice as well. I've tried their paninis and pasta salad. They both were decent but i prefer to stick with la prep breakfast."}
{"text":"LaPrep offers some healthy options as far as fast food goes. Noting that the area between Steeles and Yorkmills on Yonge St. is pretty much a culinary deadzone, you really could be eating worse food at worse places.   The setup is basically similar to a second cup, but with more food options. The fruit smoothies are pretty refreshing on a hot day (I'd recommend the carrot/orange)."}
{"text":"At lunch time this place can have a line 20 people deep!  And yet, it's just OK, maybe OK+. I think its brisk business is more a product of its location, in an area with a number of office workers but very limited options for quick, reasonably priced food. The fare is your basic 3 S's: Sandwiches, Salads and Soups. They also have a few other things, which tend to vary by the day. They only have two soups a day, but the one I did have was good. They have a decent variety of salads, which tend to be on the good side as well. Their sandwiches, though, are their weak spot. Pretty much everything here is pre-made and thus not customizable and just not fresh tasting. If you get a panini they take it out of the display case and warm it on the press for awhile, resulting in a kind of dry, lukewarm sandwich. Also, very nearly every sandwich comes with mayo on it... yuck!  I had breakfast here once, and I did customize...I requested no mayo and it took 15 minutes for a basic breakfast sandwich.  Their prices are pretty reasonable for this area, and they have soup & salad combos, or you can get two salads with your sandwich, generally for under $10.  The service here is mostly friendly and helpful. Which is good, since they don't really have a lunch menu board, and the salads aren't labelled, so you may very well need to ask questions.  There's a good amount of seating inside, and they have an area outdoors when the weather is nice. Which reminds me, this place is hidden inside an office building. Walk into the front door of 8000 Decarie, then look for the signs for La Prep. You can also get in through the parking lot behind the building."}
{"text":"Café servant des paninis/salades/soupes dans le Quartier des spectacles, limite du Quartier de la fourrure, bon service + sourire, prix  pour un 1 panini + 2 salades + café + carré aux dattes = 14.14$, bien assorti, par contre, il manque un peu de luminosité, wifi gratuit."}
{"text":"La Prep - Daily Fresh (please read as Daily Stale).  This place I can't fathom. I often have to go here for a quick bite since it's the only non-sushi place around work. It's a deli - with only pre-made salads and sanwiches. It's a modern day restaurant, with tons of pre-made salad with greasy and oily dressing (sometimes I've had oil floating around in my lunch box with some of their \"heathier looking\" salad options).  I used to get their yogurt parfait often, only to get stale and sour parfait a few times that I had to throw. I stopped buying this of course. One day I casually asked them what yogurt they use, and let me tell you, there's nothing remotely healthy about their high fat, high sugar yogurt. Best of all - I always wondered why their \"daily fresh\" parfait had such soggy granola, and I found out a few days ago. I saw a server early afternoon carrying about 20-30 parfaits on a tray, asking her colleague if she's made enough parfait for the next day.   Ummm daily fresh? I think not. Healthy? No way. Stuck in the dark ages with no low fat options, no nutritional information, no \"good for you\" foods.  So many fresh and healthy options popping up all over the PATH. Someone teach them?"}
{"text":"Food is ok and soup and salad is a good lunch option. Only, they claim to make things fresh, but the parfait for one never tastes fresh even early morning. As well, there's no nutritional info or ingredients on anything but the soups. For a deli, they don't have anything made to order, and everything, including salads, sandwiches are pre made. The only reason my colleagues and I go here - there's nothing else around us.  Some food is tasty (though often even salads are dripping in oil. That's the only reason this gets three stars, though 2.5 would have been more accurate."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place a 3 star is because of the relatively healthy food options they have Their coffee is alright for a change, but I still prefer Starbucks Americano. They have changed their decor since a couple of months ago and the place looks a little better than before. I like how it's more secluded from North York centre's mid-day havoc.  I agree with the other reviews on how much their customer service sucks. Last time I was here the girl forgot to give my change back and just left. Ok, maybe she needed to use the bathroom or something, but there's no excuse not to give a customer's change back. I told her coworker to give my change back and he did."}
{"text":"Go for the Monday Latte( special 2 dollars) almost every week. The barista made every coffee with his heart"}
{"text":"SHUT THE FRONT DOOR!  Amazing lime mint Mojito slush!!!!  So tart, sooooo good!  And get this, the BEST mocha my hubby and I have ever had!  As in the drunks were so good we WILL stop here on our next Cowtown trip!"}
{"text":"No the best place I had coffee in but not the worst. It is reasonably priced for a bout 6$ you can have a latte and a Croissant and thats what I ordered. The coffee was not bad, but a little too weak for me (I guess you can ask for an extra strong) the Croissant was horrible. I came ate around 9AM and I got a Croissant that tasted like it was a day old (or more), they even asked me if I want to re-heat it. I dont know any self respecting place that will re-heat a Croissant. I did get a great service with a smile, the place is clean and nice and the coffee was descent so I gave it a 3 and not lower (maybe I just got bad luck with the pastry)"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd visit to a Le Prep location (I previously visited the one downtown) and in both places you can find very nice staff and good atmosphere but I am afraid the in both placed the coffee is just ok, not amazing and not something that will make me re-visit."}
{"text":"Was here for some stuff and decided to try the strawberry rhubarb tart. I found it quite pleasant . . Service is quick and good. It would be helpful if all the pastries  and tarts had their prices listed on them so that we do not lose time while associates ask each other about the price ."}
{"text":"The best beef rice noodles I had in Canada! The service was very friendly! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"La Prep definitely brings me back to my university days when I was too broke to afford lunch there but it was my only option at school. Anyway! La Prep is a great place for office workers looking to grab a quick bite for lunch - lots of variety with a pleasant decor, however, quite overpriced and the food isn't amazing.  You walk in and can see all the food items offered that day (with the calorie count too, bonus!) and place your order and leave your name, pay, and wait for your order to be called. Usually I get a main (panini, sandwiches, lasagna, pot pie, etc) and 2 sides (soup, salad, pastas) for about $12 after tax. Portions are quite big (especially the sides) and there's so many options to choose from. Near the counter, there's also a bunch of dessert options too - this is very dangerous!  So today I had the smoked salmon panini (overdosed with olives... not an amazing sandwich) with the spaghetti with mushrooms (very bland) with the wild rice and honey (undercooked rice and way too sweet). Honestly such a disappointing lunch.   The only thing I'd recommend here is there potato salad. Their kale smoothie is pretty good too but definitely overpriced.   If you're looking for a better lunch option, I'd definitely prefer Porta Via over La Prep. Less options but the taste is so much better with a similar price point too."}
{"text":"I was walking west on King to an appointment and was famished. I was trying to be good, so though McDonald's, Pizza Hut and Tim Horton's were calling my name, I kept walking in search of a healthier mom and pop option. Alas, none appeared.   Finally, when I was near fainting, I pulled into La Prep. I had their soup of the day, minestrone and a pot pie. A bit of a random order for 3pm... a definite lesson in not skipping lunch.   The place is very clean, teetering on sterile and pretty boring, but well run with decent options. I think their specialties are their sandwiches and salads, but they just didn't sing to me."}
{"text":"Fresh an undoubtfully high quality food. I find it a little  overpriced for a sandwitch shop though. 1$ for a very small cookie that is not gourmet in any way ..."}
{"text":"I needed a quick meal before I had to hop on the subway so I decided to give this cafe a shot. It's located in the food court in the underground pathway in the Hundson Bay Centre.  They have a great display sandwiches, salads, soup and assorted baked goods as well as hot beverages.  I decided to combo it up and got a sandwich with 2 salads:  Ham & brie w/ basil pesto Panini with Sundried tomato pasta salad & Lemony Chickpea salad  My sister got the Roast beef w/ creole mustard, so of course we split half and half to get the best of both worlds!  Both sandwiches were served on a white baguette and were equally good and fresh tasting. Despite how long they took to toast the sandwiches the insides were not quite as hot as I would have liked and the cheese was not all gooey melty as I would have expected. I would ask them next time to toast it longer for my liking. But taste wise the sandwiches were pretty grrreat! The salads were really refreshing and great in flavour.  We had to get dessert because they had such a great selection of Dufflet individual cakes and pastries. We opted for:  Chocolate Raspberry Mousse Mini -Chocolate mousse with a heart of raspberry mousse, finished with a red glaze and a shard of dark chocolate.  This was super yummy and beautiful presented. I love the sweet milk chocolate fluffy moussse contrasted by the suttle tangy fruity raspberry glaze with a sweet raspberry mousse filling in the centre.  Nanaimo Bars - A chocolate crumb base, followed by a layer of light custard buttercream, and topped with a smooth and glossy layer of semi sweet chocolate.     I always get excited when I see these authentic Canadian treats! Perfect traditional nanaimo bar, no flaws.  As well they serve Red Rose Tea so I got one, a large is $2 bucks.  Overall you get a lot of fresh tasting great flavour food for a very reasonable price, I believe it was about 14 bucks with tax for one sandwich with 2 salads, a large tea and a dessert."}
