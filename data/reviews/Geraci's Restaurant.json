{"text":"GREAT SAUCE, every classic topping imaginable (and a few that will throw you for a loop). Family owned and operated, great for families or a first date!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good, not great. Nothing really special, I just had a regular cheese pie. A bit expensive too."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, gorgeous food, good prices. The wait can be a little nutso but worth it!"}
{"text":"We try to eat here whenever we come to Cleveland. We live in Tennessee and have many pizza places but none compares to this. The Italian sausage sub is the best!"}
{"text":"Geraci's pizza, especially the pepperoni is fantastic.  Always consistent.  They are a cash only establishment so have some with you when you go to pay for take out.  For those who are put off by that, maybe get pizza somewhere you can buy it on credit?....back to the food:I have never been disappointed and have been going here since I attended JCU.  Dinner or pizza they are all good."}
{"text":"Great pizza! It's old school. Bring your checkbook or cash. The parking lot can get a little congested, so just be patient! The pizza will be worth it."}
{"text":"Geraci's pizza is one of my earliest (and fondest) memories. An order of zucchini fries (truly superb), an antipasto salad with their homemade viniagrette, and a large pepperoni and mushroom pie (well done, please) is about as good as it gets. Service is usually very efficient. I don't think the dining room is cramped or uncomfortable, but different strokes etc. I will second the observation that it's a kid-friendly place, though, and suggest that weekend afternoons should be avoided unless you like eating with mobs of children."}
{"text":"Great Service.  Ordered appetizers and a small salad; both came and were traditional, but enjoyable; garlic bread w/ mozzarella and a small salad  For the meal, had the Linguini Carbonera. Was a very nice tasting dish, although would have liked a bit meatier element to the bacon. A lot of peas (a bit too much)  Friends got the BBQ Chicken Pizza, which I hardly consider a true test of a pizza, but they love. They really enjoyed it, I had one slice and thought it  fell apart a bit too easy, but I defer more to their judgement. A friend called in to get a togo white pizza, which I had a slice of back home and really enjoyed.   Overall, the only downside is the price. $18 for a pie seems a bit steep in these economic times, and when they are as sparse as our BBQ Chicken Pizza was, it makes paying the check a bit more questionable. I think a convincing another trip here, with more of a traditional pizza order on my part could get me up to a 5 star if the pizza lives up to the price, but for now, I'll stick with the 4."}
{"text":"We were in Cleveland on business and one of the group had seen the DDD episode.  The pictures looked good so we tried it.   First off, every place needs to take plastic. Who carries cash?  Plus, I'm traveling on business and need to put everything I can on the corporate card.  Cash is a huge hassle. Second, the pizza was only so-so.  We had three different types, so they had three chances to make a great impression, but everyone agreed they didn't accomplish it.   I won't go out of my way to try it again."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre at best. The atmosphere is weird. The service is fair. They only accept cash and it is very expensive.  I'll never go back and I don't understand why people like the place.  Yuck."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I have ever had in cleveland. I enjoyed a traditional pepperoni pizza with extra sauce. There sauce is excellent I recommend this pizza joint."}
{"text":"My husband and I had been wanting to try Geraci's forever after its appearance on D, D, & D. We live a couple hours away, so the day after Christmas was our first opportunity to visit since we were in town for the holiday. We made sure to bring cash...annoying, but whatever. We went for lunch, and due to the holiday week and the blizzard bearing down, the restaurant was practically empty. My husband ordered a meat lovers' pizza and I got a meatball sub. Both were pretty much average - nothing we'd ever write to the Food Network to rave about! The meatballs in my sub were dry and bland. We did start with an order of zucchini fries which were cooked perfectly and served with yummy house marinara. That was the one food item I can recommend. I would be remiss if I didn't mention that halfway through our meal, a VERY LOUD argument broke out between the restaurant's manager (I didn't catch her name, but she is 50's-ish with short curly hair) and a server. The argument lasted ten or fifteen minutes, no joke. It was so loud, and the restaurant is so small, that all three or four tables of customers could hear every word and were very uncomfortable. Eventually, the server, who happened to be waiting on us, left the restaurant in tears, but not before coming to our table to apologize for our having to witness such an awful scene. After the server left, the manager continued carrying on, this time telling all of the other servers and busboys what had happened and why she was right and the server was wrong. I could literally rehash what the entire argument was about because this manager was so loud and belligerent, but obviously, it doesn't matter.  At one point she said (in reference to the server), \"She should be ashamed of herself!\" Um, if there is anyone who should be ashamed here, it should be YOU, who cares more about having the last word in an argument with someone twenty years your junior than you do about your customers' dining experience. Get a new manager and some better food, Geraci's. Shame on the Food Network!"}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place. I  read the reviews and they were mixed, some people were very unsatisfied. I figured it was perhaps jealous competition due to the restaurant being around 50+ years. I should have listened. I don't understand how this restaurant was featured on TV. I don't even understand how it won best pizza in Cleveland 2008. While Cleveland isn't the land mark of pizza, there certainly are way better pies around here. This was truly disappointing and expensive.  We went last weekend hoping to get one of Cleveland's supposed best pies. The sauce is nothing to write home about. The salad was more cheese than lettuce. 50+ years and the salad isn't even together? We ordered the sicilian style pizza which we were told had romano cheese on it. When it came out, it appeared to be the powdered form of TABLE parmesan cheese. That's right, the cheese they have sitting next to the red pepper flakes at every pizza parlor. There really is no excuse for a pizza so underwhelmingly average, when a place has been around for over five decades to perfect it. You may be saying to yourself, what a mean review. That I am being too harsh. Have your opinions. Obviously Geraci's was doing something right at some point or else they wouldn't have lasted 50 odd something years. Whatever good pie they had, has left the building. I don't believe the pizza they served us today was the same as it ever was. But hey, our server was nice."}
{"text":"Pizza is mediocre. I've had better at countless other restaurants that were cheaper or similar prices. Not a fan of the dough, too thin. The sauce is sweet (something I'm not a fan of) and not very flavorful for my taste. Service was good, however, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"I ordered a plain cheese to go. Nothing special to write about. Also will only take cash, which is a bummer."}
{"text":"I am originally from Brooklyn, NY where good pizza is available on almost every street corner, and great pizza is only a short ride on the bus or train.  My family moved out of NY when I was 16 and I have not found good pizza since.  Until I went to Geraci's while I was on vacation in the Cleveland area. Outside of New York, this pizza is absolutely the best pizza I have had, and better than many places in NY!  If you are looking for a great pizza and you are within 100 miles of this place, you have to go!!  And I drove 400 miles to get there!!  Excellent pricing, the ingredients are top notch, and also, the best mozzarella sticks I have ever had!!  Never went anywhere that makes them fresh, from scratch!!"}
{"text":"A friend and I went to geracis because she had recently seen it on diner,drive ins, and dives......we arrived about 430.... Before the dinner rush. When we walked in we were told by a young lady behind the counter to step into the dining area to be seated. Okay.....we stood there with her two children for what seemed like 10 minutes, but maybe it just seemed longer because I felt like we were pretty obvious and being ignored. After being seated.....we ordered drinks, then needed time to look at the menu.  It took some time for our waiter to come back to take our actual order.  We both ordered pizza and then the wait began. No water refills, no asking if we wanted anything else to drink, the only time I saw the busboy is when my girlfriend took her daughter to the bathroom....and he started to clear the table as if we were leaving. After the wait....I was not that impressed....I ordered a meatball and mushroom pizza.....I think they used one meatball for the entire pizza....some pieces did not even have meatball on them....and it was a small pizza....skimpy with the meatballs for sure. My friend liked her pizza.....she gave it an A,  but the service got and D / F.  If I lived closer...I might try takeout.....but not sure I would make trip across town to dine..."}
{"text":"Meatballs...Yum!  Chicken Parmesan...yum! It's all yum...the pizza is outstanding. Try it and you will love it. Don't forget the cannoli's, oh my! We drive an hour to dine Rhonda Albaugh"}
{"text":"I took my wife here few weeks ago for first time the sever Harry helps with our order we got the pizza pepperoni. It was 1 of the best pizzas i ate the pepperoni was different but very good. Harry was great was great sever. I recommend this place to all my friends. Thanks for out standing food and great service."}
{"text":"eh....like most drugs it was really good the first time but has yet to match that first experience. Still pretty decent though. Not really stoked at the usual array of screaming kids and I'm pretty sure they don't accept credit either so they obviously didn't get the memo about it being the 21st century."}
{"text":"I tried Geraci's after the Food Network feature.  Three of us shared a large pizza, half-pepperoni and half-mushroom for $14.50.  It was okay but nothing exceptional.  I was not impressed by the pepperoni.  On that day the slices were actually small and shriveled.  The crust was pretty mediocre, not particularly chewy or crisp.  There is definitely better pizza in Cleveland; the pizza at Whole Foods next door is pretty good."}
{"text":"After seeing this restaurant on \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives\", we visited just at 11AM. The place fills up quickly for lunch!  Just very basic decor, but very clean! I ordered rigatoni with mushrooms, and it was very good. Meatballs (made with veal), big and tasty. My son, however, ordered a pepperoni pizza. I'm glad he ordered a large, because I tried a slice. Absolutely delicious! Among the top 3 pizzas I have ever tried! Some of it was saved to take home, and we fought over the final slices on the drive back! Magnificient pizza!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just finished having lunch here.  The house salad and house dressing very good.  We shared a large supreme pizza and it was heaven.  The toppings and sauce were fantastic.  The cheese was perfect.  Most of all I loved the crust, crunchy but still soft.  I could pick up a piece and it did not loose the toppings.  Wish I lived closer as I would be here every week.  Hope area residents appreciate the restaurant.  We traveled over an hour to eat lunch at Geraci's and would do it again.  The only reason I did not give them five stars is that the bathroom needs updating, desperately. The wedding soup, meatballs and eggplant Parmesan are very good, had those choices on the past."}
{"text":"I recommend getting: 1. The calamari. 2. Thin crust pizza with pepperoni and one other non-salty topping. 3. Glass of red wine to wash it down with a buzz.  Came here with a friend.  We got: 1. Large thin crust pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms and black olives. They are NOT cheap with the ingredients. Our pizza came fully loaded with a lot of toppings. 2. Calamari. 3. 2 house salads. Basically a vinaigrette dressing with tomatoes, ice burg lettuce and carrots.  My friend thought that the pizza was too salty, the calamari was f'ing awesome and the salad was nothing special.  I thought the pizza was salty too, probably because of the pepperoni and black olives.  The pepperoni was cut extra thick and full of flavor. The black olives made it a little saltier.  Our pizza crust was a little on the thick side probably due to the warm weather. The waitress said that yeast always seems to expand more when it's 90+ degrees outside.  The calamari was awesome. Get this if you go. The breading was light and crunchy.  Pass on the salad unless you really want to eat rabbit food."}
{"text":"I seriously do not understand what the hype is over the pizza here. We were underwhelmed and disappointed we paid so much for the lackluster pizzas. Sausage is crumbles, pepperoni was cut too thick, there was not enough sauce and the crust was very dry. No one beats Master Pizza in Painesville so far. Will not be ordering again."}
{"text":"Good eats. Pizza can be a bit greasy, but we have visited multiple times."}
{"text":"I rate 3.5 stars but not sure you can do a 1/2 star. We ordered carry out. I was a little skeptical because of yelp reviews but was pleasantly surprised. Ironically, we enjoyed the toasted ravioli appetizer with great sauce and Cesar salad better then the pizza. The pizza was ok - certainly does not hold a candle to new york and Chicago pizza but fairs ok compared to othe Cleveland pizzas. I think my favorite pizza here so far is at Flour. Oh, random side note we got plain cheese pizza.  I will return and perhaps get pasta and skip pizza."}
{"text":"I was expecting a lot after being featured on the food network however, I was very disappointed. The pizza was just so so and would be a step above Little Ceasars and a step below Pizza Hut. The service was non existent which was frustrating. No thanks!"}
{"text":"I really like this pizza. I tend not to be impressed with Cleveland's pizza, but I actually sometimes crave Geraci's sausage and pepperoni (this is the only kind I've had and I don't see why I'd try any other toppings- the sausage and pepperoni is so good!). The crust is a bit thick and chewy for my taste, but the overall pizza experience is pretty great."}
{"text":"The PIZZA here is incredible. I live in California & still daydream about going back to Cleveland just to go to Geraci's!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place around Cleveland.  They always seem to be busy but still manage to provide good service.  Make sure to bring cash because they don't accept any charge cards."}
{"text":"My kids big fan for pizza and they had it.   So when I park the car and try to get inside I get shocked at the door when I read a sign \" no credit card \" cash only and they have a ATM machine at the door !!!  The resturant environment was good and clean we get wahab we order in time fashion the service was excellent and I like the eggplant it was testy the pizza was great but only over price for 8 pieces you pay $20 that mean more than $2 per pice I think that way over when you compare it to any pizza resturant. Our over all the kids like it and there souce is incredible."}
{"text":"I am not sure what has happened but Geraci's has gone down hill over the years and tonight was the last straw - I will not go back.   My takeout was delayed by more than 20 mins not that I was told they were behind - I was not told anything just left to stand there - I had to keep asking how much longer. When I finally got my food I did not get an apology or anything just here's your food.   The food has gone downhill more than the service - my pasta with Geraci sauce was bland. The ravioli was doughy and the chicken Francesis had a pool of grease on top. Sad.  No more chances I am tired of being let down."}
{"text":"It's 4th of July and a beautiful night on the east side - people should be grillin' out, right? Where were they? Geraci's.   This was my first time here, and as soon as I walked in, I felt like I was in a pizza joint in NYC. Cozy, narrow dining room with brick arched windows overlooking the kitchen where the pizza masters are hand-tossing the dough. Took a quick glance around - saw a group of 20-somethings getting their pizza/wine on before heading out for fireworks, a family, an older couple and perhaps, a couple still in that \"getting to know you\" stage.   Service was great, starting with who we now realize was the owner greeting us in the parking lot as we locked up the car and headed toward the entrance. Started with calamari. Calamari was so tender and lightly breaded. Sauce was GREAT - big chunks of tomato and sweet, but with the right amount of acidity. Got a large pepperoni, sausage and mushroom pizza (see photo). Pepperoni was clearly homemade and nice thick slices. Sausage - also homemade and perfect amount of seasoning (not too heavy on the fennel). Crust was divine - not too thin, not too thick. And, again ... that sauce! I'm usually quick to toss the parm cheese/pepper flakes on my slice, but no need with Geraci's pizza. Savor the fresh Italian flavors.   Yup, got dessert, too. They always have tiramisu, but opted for strawberry cheesecake. Sadly, server came back and said they were out, but instead they had some chocolate cake monstrosity - I got that.   Maybe she misunderstood I only wanted one slice - she brought out this slice that could've fed a small nation! It was so moist and so packed with intense chocolate flavor. Seriously, some of the best chocolate cake I've had and wouldn't expect to find it at a pizza joint.  We'd been warned about the parking situation. Luckily, we didn't run into this since it was a holiday, but I can see how it might pose a challenge. Parking lot is one of those one-way, narrow lots. As Tim Gunn would say, make it work - the pizza's worth it!  I should add, the menu selection is extensive. Pizza, pasta, chicken, veal ... We'll be back. I was eyeing the woman's dish next to me that had this giant meatball. I want that.  Oh, they don't accept credit cards, so come prepared with cash!"}
{"text":"You have to get the little spicy pepperonis. Even our picky cheese-less pizza eater was a fan. Be prepared to being cash as credit cards aren't accepted."}
{"text":"Geraci's has the best pizza you can get on the east side of Cleveland. I have had the lasagna, pizza, and dessert pizza here. All were delicious! The Geraci's signature sauce is amazing, I really like how sweet it is. The pepperoni's are true to all the other reviews, thick cut and very juicy. I typically don't order pepperoni on my pizza at chain pizza places, but I love the pepperoni at Geraci's. The dessert pizza is also very good, but I think it's a bit over-priced for what you get."}
{"text":"Geraci's was one of the restaurants in the past that you could 'count on' for a good Italian meal.  I'm not sure what's going on over there lately, but I'm very surprised at how quickly the food quality has gone down and how expensive things are over there.     I recently ordered Fried Mozzarella and the marinara sauce tasted like metal.  I'm not sure if the sauce just wasn't cooked long enough but it shouldn't taste like metal.  I mean i understand canned tomato sauce generally comes in a metal can but your sauce should never taste of the container.    We ordered a side of meatballs which use to be some of the best around, and sadly I do not think that anymore.  It was rubbery which is the first sign of a frozen meatball! They use to make their meatballs fresh, maybe they've decided to take a shortcut but it isn't working!  I've ordered Chicken marsala and I am shocked with how expensive it is for 4 SMALL medallion sized chicken pieces.  The veal parmasan sandwich is something left to be desired these days.  Not sure if the quality of veal is lower than it was previously but it sure looked like it was hacked and pounded to the point that it was unrecognizable as veal- and let me tell you for almost $13 - I better be getting a good sandwich!  I'm disappointed at the quality and the lack of attention the restaurant has these days.  It's expensive and just plain doesn't taste good anymore.  I know it's a family owned business and I know that when Mr. Geraci himself was around the restaurant more, none of this use to happen.  Cutting corners won't get you any more profit if you're going to lose your customer base!  I probably won't be going back any time soon!"}
{"text":"Worst Italian food we have ever eaten. Even the salad and bread were a disappointment. Cut up Kraft American cheese is just a puzzle. The Manicotti tasted store bought and frozen. The Chicken Parmesan was drowned in tasteless mozzarella cheese. Oh and you better bring cash no credit card machine."}
{"text":"Visited Cleveland a couple of weeks ago. Was told to go here because it has such great pizza.   Now, as a resident of NJ, my bar is pretty high for Pizza. Geraci's didnt even come close to the bar. It was ok. thats it. just ok. Wasn't bad, but was just fair.   Though I will give good marks for the food. The food is probably where they should focus. Eggplant Parm meal and fried mozzarella. Both exceptional and done well. Though VERY pricey. Im used to high prices in the NJ-NY market, but this is cleveland. Eggplant Parm and Mozzerella set me back $25."}
{"text":"Awful....overpriced. Tasted like frozen.  Waitress did not care that the I did not like the sausage pizza. Her comment \"we have been doing it like this for 50 years\". They need Gordon Ramsey to come taste their pizza. Diner's Drive-In's and Dives you should be ashamed to say this was good pizza. Stay away.....This was the worst pizza I have had at a restaurant!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for many years but hadn't been in a while.  Place has really gone downhill - or hopefully they were just having a bad night.    Ordered 2 pizzas.  Took 30 min to get one of the pizzas - which was burnt - then another 15 min to get the 2nd pizza - which was burnt.    I have never taken the time to write a bad review for any restaurant - but I felt I had to based on the response from the cashier.  When I told her what had happened - rather than apologizing, she put the blame on me for not bringing it to their attention so they could cook new pizzas.  We had already wasted 45 minutes waiting on food that night - so it was obvious to me it was time to leave.    I'll never be back, but best of luck to them in fixing this family run business.  Its a shame to see what it has become."}
{"text":"They have the BEST GLUTEN FREE pizza crust, it tastes very similar to \"normal\"-flour dough and has the same texture which I really like.  I have eaten here for years and enjoyed the food.  Now that I am eating gluten free, I have a place to still cure that pizza craving.  YUM."}
{"text":"Our terrible meal at Geraci's began immediately after we opened the door. I have to admit that we were drawn to this restaurant after hearing that it had been featured on Diner's, Drive-In's and Dives, or as we like to call it, Triple D. I recently moved to Ohio from the east coast (where delicious pizza abounds) and I was hoping that Geraci's could be the place to go when having a pizza craving. Unfortunately the search continues as this place not only had the worst pizza I have ever had, but the restaurant itself was terrible as well.  1. Walked in around 3pm on a Saturday to a mostly empty restaurant and had to watch as 3 employees ignored us as we waited to be seated.  2. Spotted a 2 person booth in the back, but had to move because of the overwhelming bleach smell emanating from the bathroom.  3. Opened the menu to find food residue all over it. At this point I was still willing to overlook these things if the food was amazing...  4. Ordered their Geraci's Salad and a small pizza with Sausage, Mushrooms, and Black Olives. We were starving and excited.  5. As we waited for our food, I overheard two different tables complaining about their food. Not a good sign.   6. Get our salad. It was clearly pre-made (which I am willing to overlook as I know this place can get busy) What I can't overlook is the fact that it has YELLOW AMERICAN CHEESE on it!! As in plastic cheese!! Most of the lettuce was brown and had one lone black olive slice in it. Oh wait almost forgot....we couldn't eat it because we didn't have forks...  7. The dressing was the only decent thing this place has going for it.  8. Got our tiny and expensive pizza and were immediately disappointed. It didn't taste like anything. The sauce didn't taste like tomatoes, the cheese....wait was cheese on it? The sausage was okay but lacking as well. The mushrooms and olives filled my stomach and that is about it. I covered my slice in grated cheese, salt, and pepper, and still I was having a hard time tasting my food.  9. Forgot about the iced tea which tasted of chemicals.  10. I am always willing to give places another shot, but it won't be happening for Geraci's. I was extremely disappointed and won't be returning.   We were quite upset after we left as we had wasted money and our appetites. To cheer ourselves up we pointed out all of the places that would have been better than our meal at Geraci's which include: -Papa John's -Domino's -Pizza Hut -$5 Pizza at Costco -Little Caesar's -Sbarro's at the mall food court - .99 Mama Celeste frozen pizza  Sorry to be so mean, but how hard is it to mess up pizza?"}
{"text":"Not so good any longer. Do not know what happened, but it happened. Will not be going any longer. Sad but true. It now has sub par food.Many other good Italian restaurants to choose from, so go ahead and choose another."}
{"text":"The more basic the food you order, the better it is. Their plain ol' cheese pizza is to die for."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Cleveland. Great crust, sauce and fresh toppings.  Slightly thicker crust at this American style pizzeria. If you prefer European-style thin crust pizza try Valentino's in little Italy instead.  Have less experience with other menu items but they also seemed well prepared.   Ambiance is that of a friendly family restaurant. Strip mall location and the fact that they do not accept credit cards are the only downsides."}
{"text":"I saw Geraci's on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives the other day, and when I realized it was only a few miles away, I made plans to go as soon as possible.  My intent was to use online reviews to help decide what to order, but then I got a little concerned because a lot of them were pretty negative.  We decided that it was worth a shot and went anyway..  It was AWESOME!  Every employee we interacted with was very nice and welcoming, and we were never left without full drinks or good service.  We went with the meat lover's pizza and a meatball apiece a la carte.  The meatballs came before the meal, which was perfect to tide us over.  They were delicious, especially with the bread as a side to mop up all the sauce.  Finally, and best of all, was the pizza.  We were in heaven.  The crust was perfectly crisped on the bottom, but not burned.  The meats were delicious, the sauce was chunky and flavorful, and it was a combination to die for.  I don't know where the other reviewers ate, but it doesn't seem possible that it was the same place we visited! A little pricey, yes, but I would definitely make a return visit."}
{"text":"I would love to love this place because I could walk there-seems like such a great local business to support...not so much. Twice now I have not gone through with a take out order because the girls over the phone were so rude about helping with the menu. I have driven the extra mile to pizzazz plenty of times instead-much better service and a much more appealing menu to choose from!!"}
{"text":"This old school pizza place was very cool.  It is a very good family restaurant and wasn't to busy on a Saturday afternoon.  I thought the pepperoni was very good."}
{"text":"Picked up a pizza to go while up in Cleveland to visit family. I'm sure Geraci's pizza will be on our itinerary for every future trip. The pizza had just the right amount of everything and had just the right flavor! Thanks Geraci's!!"}
{"text":"PERFECT pizza.  Has lunch when we were in town for a wedding...great pizza and great service.  Could not recommend more highly."}
{"text":"For a pizzeria in Ohio this place is sure to be at the top of the heap compared to other pizzeria's / Italian restaurants in that fine state. HOWEVER being that I have lived in New York for many years -read access to some of the best Italian food anywhere . . . I was not impressed in the least. The sauce reminded me too much of sauce from a jar -also onions have no place in a plain cheese pie. The kids liked it, but then again most kids also like Chef Boyardee.   Sorry but when I go out of my way to try an establishment that was recommended on Diner's Drive-In's and Dives I expect something spectacular like 'Melt' instead of just average and edible.   If you are not going out of your way to go there then fine, otherwise do not waste your time."}
{"text":"The pepperoni pizza had the char on both the crust as well as a slight char on the pepperoni and the cheese.  Superb."}
{"text":"This restaurant has friendly service, and that's about it.  We ordered a $5 salad, (didn't opt for a pile of mozz on top for the extra $1), and it was a handful of salad that looked like it came from a bag-0-salad at the local grocery.  Pitifully leaning on the lettuce were 2 tiny cherry tomatoes.  For the prices charged here, you'd think there would be a thoughtfully assembled fresh salad, cloth napkins, warm bread, olive oil to dip....SOMETHING?! The bread was cold store-bought italian, served with cold plastic packs of land o lakes butter.  Trying to spread cold butter on cold bread while chewing the dreadfully over- priced lettuce was just what I needed to work up a real appetite for the pizza we ordered.  Now, I've heard the pepperoni pizza is very  good, and wish that's what we had ordered.  We ordered the pesto pizza, and it was the most flavorless, disappointing excuse for pizza I've tasted in a long time.  I had pizza in Ireland that tasted more authentic and flavorful.  The pesto was sparse and not seasoned at all.  The chicken was dry, the tomatoes had obviously been refrigerated because they had no flavor whatsoever.  The artichokes tasted like the tin can from which they probably came. We literally had to salt and pepper our pizza at the table because it tasted like nothing. Thank goodness they provide the red pepper flakes and fake parm at the table, just like pizza hut or other imposter Italian places, it's just a shame they don't charge the same prices.   The crust was soft, but not chewy and delicious, just soft and forgettable.  The edge looked crispy, but looks can be deceiving.  Once again, this all would not be so offensive if I didn't feel as though I was being charged an outlandishly obnoxious price for what seemed to be a meal I could make for a quarter the price and 100 times more flavorful on my own at home.  This was an epic fail, and I don't know that we'll be revisiting any of Guy's featured DDD places.  Ever.   ps, about half way through our meal, in the almost empty restaurant, our party of 2 was joined by a party of 4 (parents and 2 teens) six inches away from us.  It's like we were forced for no reason to be part of complete strangers' family dinner, and it was just the two of us.  There was seating available everywhere else, but for some reason it was necessary to smash us all together in one tiny corner. Extremely inconsiderate."}
{"text":"Geraci's is one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland.   * I love their homemade \"House\" salad dressing  * I love their fried mozzarella appetizer  * I love their pizza - IT IS THE BEST!!  *I love their angel hair pasta and marinara sauce  * I love how you can watch the staff toss the pizza's in the air as they make them  * I love the family friendly atmosphere  * I love how friendly the staff are  I* love their desserts. Mmmmmmm Spingi!!   The ONLY thing I do not like is having to wait for a table!! Geraci's is a wonderful little place and they are popular and often have a wait. They have some seating to wait, otherwise you have to hang around outside. Do not get me wrong, it is worth the wait, but if you are REALLY hungry or in a hurry, you may have to go at an \"off\" time or come back when you can wait."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had ever. Ever. Ask for it \"well done.\" Sounds odd, but do it. Also, kickass meatballs."}
{"text":"Best pepperoni pizza arround. A constant in an ever changing world (my grandparents used to eat here.) Family owned and operated. Reasonable prices. Great service. Never had a bad experience here. To sum things up, it's just good Italian food, everytime."}
{"text":"Really great pizza joint on the east side. This is probably my favorite place to get straight up pepperoni pizza in town. They cut their pepperoni very thick which is a great change from the norm. I do wish the crust was a tad bit thicker, but overall it's all very excellent.  Watch out when you go to pick up though, they don't take credit card, so you need to have cash or use the ATM in the building."}
{"text":"First, the service was exceptional, Gabriella waited on us, she was great.  I had the gnocchi with pesto and shrimp-delicious!  My wife had the gnocchi with pesto and chicken, she said it was also delicious.  For an appetizer we had toasted- perfect!  For desert we had limoncello which was right up my alley.  Everyone should try Geraci's at least once."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. That is the only reason for the 4th star. The rest of the food is okay, but nothing extraordinary.  Service is casual but fitting for a strip mall restaurant, a bit slow sometimes.  Cash only can be annoying."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Cleveland and maybe the best I've ever had! Whenever I travel Cleveland to see family I have to stop in for a sausage pie! Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on diners and drives, MapQuested it and it was 40 mins from where I live, ok I'm gonna try it. Got there at about 5:30pm and no wait but tables were almost full. We ordered and was ready to try this great pizza that all the people raved about on tv, we got half pepperoni and bacon, half artichoke and spinach. The pizza was a big disappointment, the sauce and cheese were absolutely tasteless!!! And it had those chunks of tomatoes that fall onto your plate eww. The pepperoni and bacon were very yummy tho but how could they not be, my gf said the artichoke and spinach was ok kinda plain tasting and she also didn't care for the pizza sauce. The bill came and it was 21.95 for just the pizza alone wtf!!  And i thought Angelo's in Lakewood was expensive sheesh.  So overall the place is just ok, if I lived closer I would maybe go back and try a pasta dish but since its outta my way that prob wont happen. Oh and the service and staff were very friendly and good so that was good."}
{"text":"Ordered a carry out order from Geraci's for my birthday at 2:49pm was told 30 minutes it will be ready. After having my mother drive up there from Twinsburg at 4:05 pm she had to cancel the entire order for my family due to nothing being ready. After being a huge advocate of Geraci's this has definitely ruined it for me."}
{"text":"Decent pizza. But 90 mins (when they say 60) is insane. Especially with zero offer for compensation."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in Cleveland. Nice and inviting, the pinnacle of Italian American restaurants with loads of authentic ingredients.  The pizza? On par or better than Mama Santa's in Little Italy. I'd say better because of the hearty slices of pepperoni, a zesty mix of mozz and provalone without getting to sharp, and the perfect pizza dough.  Service is a little slow from what I remember but friendly, and apparently the take-out/delivery pizza isn't quite the same."}
{"text":"I went here recently with a large group of people. We were seated as quickly as possible and ordered different things.   Everyone insisted that the pizza was the best in CLE, but my wife and I didn't see it. We split a pepperoni and, while we enjoyed the thickness of the pepperoni, we found the pizza sauce to  be underwhelming and the grease to be excessive. Pizza is known to be greasy, but it seemed to roll out of the pizza in waves and almost took the cheese with it.    My wife was also not a fan of the calamari pasta - now, she loves calamari in all its incarnations and especially in pasta. However, she was very put out by how chewy the calamari in the pasta was - calamari in pasta is normally fried to be crispy but not the calamari here. It created a weird texture in the pasta for her that made the pasta difficult to find appetizing. She also found the pasta sauce to be simple and - I quote - \"out of a can\".  Is the pizza and pasta decent? Yes. Is it tasty? Yes. Is it the best in CLE? No, at least not from what we experienced. We will definitely go again when we want pizza at a fair price rather quickly, but from now on will keep our expectations limited to good pizza at a good price."}
{"text":"People in the heights go freaking crazy for this place. I have to say, I never really understood the draw. The food is good. The service is usually okay (I don't blame the wait staff...this place is ALWAYS swamped). It is a family type place so there are usually a lot of little kids running about and babies crying. That usually makes everyone tense.   I just don't think it is worth going out of your way for.   Downside:  Cash only.   It is in a strip mall on a busy street so the traffic always makes me tense.  Lots of kids. (I guess that is a bonus if you have kids)."}
{"text":"Another Diners Drive-Ins & Dives place checked off the list!   Be warned, they only take cash!  That being said, my boyfriend and I stopped in on a weekday in the middle of the afternoon and quite literally had the place to ourselves. We started with the fried zucchini and the toasted ravioli appetizers. We almost regretted ordering entrees because the appetizers were so good and so large.   He ordered the baked lasagna, I ordered the eggplant parm. Now, if you've read any reviews I've posted of Italian places, you know I'm pretty critical of my eggplant parm. This was good. Not great, but good. It had excellent flavor, however, it was a little overcooked and lacked texture. I still enjoyed every bite because it tasted very good in spite of the texture issue.  Brad's lasagna, on the other hand, was FLAWLESS. Instead of beef, they used Italian sausage, which just took the flavor profile to a new level of delicious. Lots of ooey gooey cheese, flavorful sauce, and a nice little crust on the top from the oven-baking, there was absolutely no criticism I could make of the lasagna. I never order lasagna at restaurants because my grandmother's recipe is my favorite and there is no need to eat inferior lasagnas out somewhere. I would order this lasagna in a heartbeat.  I understand that there are a lot of negative reviews about Geraci's, and a lot of the criticism is directed at the cash-only thing and the lady who runs the front counter (if it makes them feel any better, the rest of the staff doesn't seem to care for her much either and seemed relieved when she finished her shift and left while we were still eating). I would encourage you to try this place, and if the negative pizza reviews scare you, do yourself a favor and order the lasagna!"}
{"text":"Small family owned bizz, I wasn't really blown away by the pizza, and it took about 40 min to get a table which was right next to 3 yappy kids and two equally yappy older ladies. The waitress was wonderful and the service was pretty prompt. We just stopped in for a quick pizza; they give you fresh bread when your first  seated and I ordered some root beer which was nice. The pizza gets a lot of reviews, specially the pepperoni, but I really didn't find anything very unique about it. We'll be going back to give them another opportunity to knock it out of the park and Ill be sure to post an update."}
{"text":"I am not sure why this restaurant was featured on a prominent TV show. The pizza was very good, as were the meatballs. But I think that people who rave about this place really haven't had a wide sampling of great pizza. I thought the pepperoni would be out of this world, but it was just slightly above average. For Cleveland, this is a gem. I definitely respect the locals who have loved it for decades. Try it, it's good. 4 is generous."}
{"text":"I had to edit this review after being here several times.  I still love the fact that they're a small family-owned business that is still going strong, but do yourself a favor and just get takeout.    Every single time I've been there the service has been SLOW and RUDE.  You wait forever to get a table (because the service is so slow!), and then they treat you like YOU'VE been keeping THEM waiting, and how dare you have questions.  God help you if you need to flag down the waitstaff for any reason.  You *might* get your water glass filled in time for your bedtime pills.    The pizza really is good, though, so the rest of my review stands:    There are a couple of things that really sets Geraci's apart for me.  First off, it's not greasy at all.  We got the deluxe, and even with both pepperoni and sausage, neither the crust nor the toppings were greasy.  Both the pepperoni and the sausage are obviously made with REAL MEAT, not processed meat-like disks and nuggets.  The veggies are fresh too - no canned mushrooms here.  The sauce and crust were just right for me too.  The sauce is flavorful and not overly sweet, and the crust is on the thinner side but not cracker-thin.    The calamari was great too - light and crispy and amazing with the spicy marinara.    I've heard that they have really good meatballs there too, but I'm not sure I'd be able to pass up the pizza to try them!    A couple of things to think about before going -  1. They're going to be busy, so plan to go when you're not in a hurry.  In a pinch, call in a carry out.   2. They don't take credit cards, so make sure you have enough cash in hand.   3. It's a little pricey for pizza, but you really get what you pay for.    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pizza and fried ravioli was great, good service, nice atmosphere, I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"My visit to Geraci's was the first time I ever left a pizza joint not stuffed ridiculously full and ready to pop. It was fantastic.   The restaurant is situated in a tiny shopping plaza and at first glance it appears there may not anywhere to park. There is additional (although I'm not sure it's theirs) parking in the back of the building. When you walk in the door you're greeted with the familiar \"Guy was Here\" poster - I've seen the episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives that featured Geraci's - so I had come with some pretty high expectations.   Upon fully entering the establishment you are greeted with a \"Please Seat Yourself\" sign - which is kinda nice since you are able to choose any booth or table you want. On this particular trip, many of the tables were full (we stopped in for a late-ish lunch, around 1:30pm) but not overbearingly packed. The restaurant appeared clean (no sticky tables or dirty booths here) and we were greeted by a waitress within minutes of taking a seat. Pouring over the menu we settled on a large pepperoni pizza with half sausage and half onion (my personal fave) and we also ordered a Caesar salad to share.  When our salad arrived at our table it looked very homemade, the lettuce was fresh, the cherry tomatoes were ripe, and the parmesan and mozzarella cheese on top was divine. The only minor disappointment was that the salad wasn't tossed with the dressing (it was just on top) - but I made due and mixed it myself. Not too much longer after that we were greeted with our delicious looking pizza pie. The waitress then proceeded to plate a piece for each of us - which at first confused me, but I guess it was a nice \"customer service-y\" touch.  The pizza looked appetizing and didn't have pools of grease on top. The hand-tossed regular crust was perfect, not overly done and definitely not crispy/greasy like some of the chain restaurants. The pepperoni was thick and AMAZING. It was my favorite part of the whole meal. The sausage was good too - but there was a lot of it - and it was somewhat overpowering. The sauce was another highlight - it wasn't heavy and didn't taste anything like the canned sauces that other pizza places use.   For dessert we were tempted to order the Spingi (fried dough in a basket) but opted instead for the apple caramel cheesecake - which was divine!  The waitress was friendly but our drinks were left empty for a good length of time (in her defense the cups are tiny and we were thirsty).   Some final notes - 1. They don't take credit cards, make sure you have cash on you. 2. You take your bill up to the front - you don't need to wait for your waitress to take it up for you. 3. Order some pepperoni! 4. You can take a group for a celebration but it may be hard to find a large table all together."}
{"text":"I saw Guy Fieri come here once on the Food Network. After that I didn't try this place for at least a couple years.   Finally tried it after some townies raved about their pizza. I love pizza in all its forms. I did not regret my decision.  NY has their greasy bar pizza that can be folded like culinary origami. New Haven has the super thin slightly burnt crust pizza. Chicago has their stroke inducing deep dish pizza. Cleveland has Geraci's.  On a cold, sunless Cleveland winter day, I can always find comfort in a Geraci's pizza.   I usually get the deluxe pizza, well done, with light cheese. I don't know what it is about it, but it's really good. They have other foods, but I have never been as impressed as with their pizza.   It seems to be one of those rare instances where I can agree with Guy Fieri when he says that Geraci's makes his flavor hole tingle. I would say that it makes my heart sing. Tomato, tomato, I guess."}
{"text":"I saw this place on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives; so my girlfriend and I decided to try it out.  The customer service is friendly and the place is cozy and clean.  The menu had plenty of options and the food was fresh.  However, the food lacked depth of flavor.  Though the food is definitely cooked with love, it just misses that bite of food that gets you to want to come back.  However, I packed my food in a doggy bag and it actually tasted better the next day.  I don't know that that means, but I guess that just means that maybe I would ask them for food from yesterday night's service."}
{"text":"I've been searching the planet for 50 years to find a better pizza, Geraci's is still the best."}
{"text":"Used to come here almost 30 years ago with my girlfriend Anne when lived in University Heights. The food was always good & we always had a good time  The food must be still good as it is still in business. If I'm in the Cleveland Metro area in the future I won't hesitate to stop on by & say hello."}
{"text":"My husband and I joined my best friend and her parents for dinner. We had a hilarious, outstanding server. We shared a pizza which was delicious. The side salad was huge and full of veggies and cheese. The creamy Italian dressing was a hit. My husband had mussels for dinner and he described them as clean and the garlic wine sauce was very flavorful. I got the gnocchi. They were okay but the sauce left little to be desired. It tasted very bland. I'm glad everyone else enjoyed their meal at the table but I know I'd rather go to other Italian restaurants before returning here."}
{"text":"Pros:  1. I'm not the most reliable person to ask because I'm vegetarian, but my daughter and I loved their pizza and fried mozzarella.   2. Ambiance was nice. Waiter was friendly.   Cons: 1. Do NOT sit in the back. The walls are paper thin and you can hear everything that goes on in the bathrooms.  2. Bring cash with you. They don't take cards. There is an atm, but you'll be spending the extra charges for that on top of the pizza."}
{"text":"This is a really cozy, friendly neighborhood kind of place that probably hasn't changed much over the years...but it's part of its charm. The food (Italian) is legendary, and the smells are out of this world. For years, they only accepted cash, but that may have changed."}
{"text":"What this restaurant doesn't realize is that when you dine out at a restaurant, that you're paying for two things, food and service.  Went here on a night that was not busy with maybe 60% of their tables full, with two people and ordered simple pasta and a large pizza.  We literally sat there for 50 minutes, asking our waiter on two separate occasions where our pizza was, with him giving us some loose interpretation of, I have no idea.  As we watched the table behind us and next to us almost finish their pizzas, I had had all I could take and left my friend at the table to wait for the pizza as I went out to the car, never having a bite to eat after having sat there for almost an hour. If service doesn't mean anything to you, then you're in the right place with this restaurant because they don't have a clue as to what customer service is all about. Excuse me for expecting even a little hint of service when I'm in a restaurant, but this place fails miserably when it comes to service and customer satisfaction.  NOT A FAN OF THIS PLACE AT ALL.  My best advice is to save your money and go across the street to Rascal House Pizza where you'll get some good Italian pizza and at least some service. It beats this place hands down."}
{"text":"The food was decent-nothing extraordinary. It was overpriced and the salad and bread were underwhelming.The salad was iceberg lettuce, purple cabbage and cherry tomatoes in a very small Styrofoam bowl. The bread was not toasted and seemed to be purchased from a grocery chain.For 15 dollars I expected more portions and better quality sides. Establishment takes cash only."}
{"text":"Best \"Cleveland style\" pizza. I lived in NYC and visited Naples Italy quite a few times. They are each famous for their own styles. This is the best North East Ohio pizza!"}
{"text":"Geraci's   This is a great small restaurant located near Warrensville and close to the JCU campus.  Do not let the strip mall location of this place fool you, the food is on par.  The great thing about this place is the fact that the kitchen is surrounded by glass so you can watch the cooks throwing the pizza dough.  The salads at this place were very fresh, and I always had the spinach ravioli (hand rolled / hand cut) for my entrée.  A quick story and side note with respect to this place.  I got a date with this girl on like a Wednesday of the week for that Saturday night.  My buddy who lived down the hall from me in Sutowski said that I could borrow his BMW for that night.  Now while this was a BMW, it was a 1983 with over 200,000 miles on it.  This ride looked every bit of having been parked outside for twenty consecutive Cleveland winters.  I picked this girl up and we went to Geraci's.  We had a great time and I actually gave this girl her first kiss by the old Saint Ignatius statue that night.  Why I can never forget this night is because of what happened to that BMW a week later.  My buddy was racing down some country road at about 90 to 100 miles per hour when he hit some uneven freight train tracks and flew about 100 yards into a corn field and rolled the car.  He was uninjured (somehow) and was taken to the hospital for observation and was subsequently discharged.  About a week goes by and my buddy is calling the state police like every 10 minutes to check on the status of his ride.  Keep in mind the first responders had to use the jaws of life to extricate my buddy, so to a sane person, the \"status\" of his ride was really a foregone conclusion.  My buddy never gets a return phone call from the state police just a mail package from the state police containing the steering wheel of his car.  My buddy started to laugh...then cry."}
{"text":"Is Geraci's worth the Diners, Drive Ins and Drives hype? I guess you'll have to figure that out yourself.  Important Note: Geraci's does not accept credit cards!  We arrived around 2pm. We seated ourselves and got our drinks pretty quick. After that it went downhill. We were kind of in a hurry and a family that arrived after us ordered first. (We were annoyed). We finally ordered and it took a decent amount of time to get our food even though there were 2 full tables.  How was the food? Not bad. Geraci's sauce was good. Meatballs are cooked in the sauce which gives it a really nice flavor. My wife said meatballs had little flavor but I thought they were pretty good. We ordered a pepp pizza too. Crust was nice and crispy, good amount of cheese, pepps were nice as well. Sauce I didn't care for as much. It was a really chunky style pizza sauce which isn't my cup of tea.  Overall, the food was good. The service is what caused me to give a 3 start rating (and the pizza sauce a little)."}
{"text":"BEST PEPPERONI EVER.  That's all I have to say.  It's thick, it's spicy, and it's delicious!  The sauce is not bad either, and I just love the history of this place.  I grew up in NY having pizza at least once a week, and while I would never compare the two, Geraci's definitely has a special place in my heart.  The pizza is to die for!!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch and let me tell you.....OMG sooooo good! We walked in and were greeted right away. The dining room has that old Italian feel which was so cozy and inviting. The place was full of people and the service was still really good.  Now to the food....the best pizza I've ever had. I like pizza a little more over done and this pizza was cooked perfectly. We did order a cannoli to share and it was really good too. We left there full and happy! They only take cash which is fine because they do have an atm machine in the front by the door. I would recommend this place if you are looking for some good old fashioned Italian food. Good stuff."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal! Authentic old school Italian atmosphere. Godfathers welcome! This is my second time here. Excellent service and some of the best pizza I've had."}
{"text":"Got the minestrone soup and pepperoni pizza and both were excellent. The staff was extremely friendly and it was very clean. Not your ordinary pizza crust, but definitely worth trying out."}
{"text":"It was okay. Pizza overpriced 13.95 for a large pepperonii. Very dry. Needed a lot more sauce. Waitresses are okay. But, atmosphere was pretty nice. Thought It would've been better. Would've rather went somewhere else. Don't waste your time here. Or money!!!! A chicken salad was $12!! What a waste"}
{"text":"Good pizza, but have been less impressed with other entree options. Ate dinner with small kids here and it felt a bit cramped, so I would leave the kids at home or get takeout next time. Cash only so be prepared!"}
{"text":"After seeing Geraci's on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on Food Network, my boyfriend and I decided to visit Geraci's one Tuesday evening.  My boyfriend loves pizza, and I love Italian food, so we figured it would be a lovely evening of great food.    We arrived at Geraci's to find a very small parking area in the front of the restaurant.  All parking spots were full, so we finally found a spot in the rear of the building.  We walked inside to find an almost full restaurant.  Right away, I didn't like the seating arrangement.  Along one wall is a continuous bench-style seat, with tables in front of the bench.  On the opposite side of the tables are traditional chairs.  This seating style means you will sit next to people you don't know, and with the close quarters, being annoyed by loud people is a very real possibility.  I saw a couple traditional booths in the rear of the restaurant, but I'm sure those are hard to come by unless Geraci's accepts reservations.  Our server arrived pretty promptly and took our drink order while giving us a few minutes to look over the menu.  I ordered the lasagna on our server's recommendation (it was either lasagna or stuffed shells,) and my boyfriend ordered a large pepperoni and cheese pizza.  I also ordered a single meatball because I love meatballs.  My dinner came with a salad, but since I'm allergic to lettuce, I was able to substitute either cole slaw or applesauce.  I chose cole slaw, and it was very, very good.  Creamy, with just enough of a sour kick to make it delicious, it was some of the best cole slaw I've had in a long time.  We were given bread while we were waiting on our dinners.  The bread itself was good, but it was missing something.  If it had either been warm, or served with some type of dipping option, the bread would have been great.  I noticed this to be a common theme during our dinner at Geraci's; the food was average because something was missing from each item we ate.  Our dinners arrived after about 20 minutes, which was acceptable considering how busy the restaurant was while we were there.  The pizza looked delicious, with a generous amount of melted cheese, and an equally generous amount of pepperoni.  The crust was on the thin side, but wasn't paper thin.  My boyfriend said the pizza was good, but not great.  I tasted a piece, and had to agree with him.  I've had better pizza, and again, the pizza was missing something.  It's as though they were depending upon the pepperoni alone to carry the pizza, but had the sauce been spiced just slightly, it would have been a great pizza.  My lasagna was the same scenario.  While good, it wasn't great.  The portion was generous, and there was a generous amount of cheese and sauce.  But again, it was somewhat bland.  Just a little kick to the sauce and it would have been delicious instead of average. Finally, the meatball I had was average.  It was generously sized, tender and moist, but it was also bland.  Again, just a little something added to the meatball and it would have been delicious.    Overall, neither of us were super-impressed with Geraci's food.  For $36 we had an 8 slice pizza ($12.95,) order of lasagna ($15.95,) 2 sodas, one meatball ($1.75,) bread and a side of cole slaw.  So, after tip ($9,) we spent $45 for an average meal.  To me, the food isn't worth the cost.  If some effort was put forth to tweak the recipes just a bit, the food would be phenomenal.  The service, thankfully, was excellent.  Our server was attentive to when our sodas were getting low, when empty plates needed removed and when we needed to-go boxes.  Even though there were people waiting to be seated, we did not feel rushed at all.  We did order a large pepperoni and cheese pizza for take-out earlier this week, and it was the same as the first time we had their pizza.  So, they are consistent with their food, and it's a nice change from chain-store or frozen pizza.  If we're in the neighborhood we'll pick up a pizza to-go, but I don't see us returning for an actual dinner."}
{"text":"I've been going to geraci's for the last 40 years and of course has changed ownership but it's still okay not like it used to be. It would be nice if they remodeled or did something to freshen up the place a little bit the garlic bread is always the best pizzas average used to be great but I'm not sure what happened to it their salads are average also parking still a mess"}
{"text":"As a guy from a small town in upstate New York with dozens of pizza joints, I was a little skeptical when a buddy of mine told me about Geraci's and their unbelievable pizza. My friend was dead-on....one of the best tasting pizzas I have ever had. Lucky, we knew to go when it was not crowded.  And we had been warned about no credit cards. And yes, the outside of the restaurant was a little non descript. However, once we walked in the door and saw Mr. Geraci (a 90 year old owner) there on Sunday greeting his friends and loads of people walking out with pizza boxes, we were very anxious to taste the pie. The sauce, cheese and crust were all 10's! Wonderful and quick service made this a certain stop every time we pass through Cleveland."}
{"text":"Came to Cleveland via a road trip from California,  decided on a pizza. Took a moment on yelp to read reviews and this is the place to eat. Our server was extremely nice as was everyone who we were in contact with, and the pizza was exceptional! I normally don't review but I thought this little pizza place deserved it."}
{"text":"After seeing Geraci's on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, I knew I had to try it!  I found myself on the east-side this week and stopped in for dinner. I cannot tell you how much we enjoyed this restaurant.  The meatballs were flavorful and tender.  The toasted cheese ravioli appetizer was amazing! They were large and perfectly crispy.  The pizza was wonderful. The crushed tomatoes on it really gives it a nice taste. The crust was very crispy and not too thin.   Our waiter was very polite and our food was brought to us in a timely manner. I really cannot wait to go back!  For this west-sider it was worth the trip to the east-side in the snow!   The only downside would be they are cash only."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed.  I felt compelled to write another review, as I left Geraci's feeling disappointed in:  - the service - the food  That's about all there is to a restaurant, right?  The place was pretty busy for our party of 6 - we had to wait about 5 or so minutes for a table to get cleared.  It looked chaotic behind the pizza counter.  We got waited on fairly fast, too. Friendly staff.  And we got our drinks fairly quickly, too.  The problem came after getting the salads.  No bread.  It was promised, then never came.  My wife ordered a salad as entree and never did get bread.  Then the pizzas came out (three of us got them).  While the sauce was just as tasty as I remember, the dough was undercooked on the pizzas.  No crispiness, not even chewy.  The toppings were done, but the crust wasn't.  What happened?  Consistency is really important, but I only get here like once a year.  Will I return again?  Probably.  But I most likely won't carve out valuable time from my visit."}
{"text":"Pizza is absolutely always amazing!!! I love there pizza and I think nothing around here compares! It's a small, cramped place and usually they are late with call in orders... But it is worth it!!! We get the pepperoni and get it cooked \"well done\"!  Every single time it is pure bliss.  I wish it wasn't cash only. It is a must try!"}
{"text":"Expensive for the quality AND you have to pay in cash. Nice enough staff, but nothing to write home about. I'm still surprised it was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives... maybe it's the dive part."}
{"text":"We ordered the traditional gourmet pizza with sausage, onions mushrooms, and pepperoni, green peppers , onions . It was very good.one of the best in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza joints in Cleveland.  Geraci's have been around forever, a Cleveland staple. I've only ever had pizza and salads so I can't comment on the other offerings. But the pizza is damn good! Crust is thin, no canned shrooms, fresh basil... really good stuff. Their sausage is super yummy.  Most pizza places in Cleveland seem to have the same tasting pizza. Geraci's definitely stands out with something a little different. They deserve the press they are getting. I just hope the stint on Food Network doesn't turn this into a 2 hr wait kind of place.  And remember to bring cash!"}
{"text":"My family and I ate here specifically because they were on Diners, Drive-in and Dives.  And we all ordered a meatball since that was their specialty.  I must be picky with meatballs since I didn't think it was anything special.  However, I did like that you were able to order one meatball to try, so that was a plus.  While I was not thrilled with the meatball, I did really enjoy my pizza. I ordered the grilled chicken with pesto sauce, artichoke hearts, and roasted red peppers.  This pizza was not only beautiful, it was also incredibly flavorful.  I would definitely come back here for this pizza and I would like to try their other options."}
{"text":"I thought there were no truly great pizza joints in Cleveland metro until an older gentleman I work with told me about Geraci's. So we (the family) tried it, and there's no going back. My opinion of all other pizza restaurants in Cleveland just went down a notch. It just so good, so so good. Slightly sweet sauce, slightly spicy and blackened pepperoni, perfect traditional crust. The real thing.  I thought about giving Geraci's four stars because rarely, from time to time, there will be a slight inconsistency in quality. But no, 5 stars it is. I keep going back to this place and spending my money there time after time after time, and that speaks volumes."}
{"text":"Writing this review before we even get our food, because at this point I don't even care how good it might be. The service is awful! Waitress seems extremely put out that we are here. Unresponsive to requests, rushing to take our menus from us as we are ordering, annoyed with questions regarding the menu, doesn't fill drinks unless directly and repeatedly asked. Drove over an hour to get here because we saw the place on tv. Won't be back. We can get good pizza AND good service elsewhere."}
{"text":"Best pizza around. By far.  Pickup (or dine-in), only.  Going they get on UberEATS soon so I can get their sausage pizza more often."}
{"text":"It pains me to have to put up one star.  Calamari over-breaded and not seasoned.  No aoli for dipping but did come with an awful marinara.  Main course of Chicken Picatta ( chopped up chicken breast with a tasteless gelatinous attempt at a lemon butter sauce) as i looked at table next to me i saw the same gelatinous consistency of the chicken marsala sauce.  My girlfriend had the lasagna, not as bad but it was also bland.  The place was packed which made me laugh.  The funnier kick in the crotch is they only accepted cash or check. I think Geracis is relying on a reputation built in the past.  I would never write a bad review due the the fact that i have a background in the culinary arts and understand the difficulty of running a successful restaurant.   My final thought is the food was awful and bland..had pizza once and not the impressive either.   i apologize for this review but no one apologized for charging me money for this food.  i am embarrassed that Diner Drive Ins and Dives was obviously solicited by one of the many that actually give this place a good review to come there.  If you are looking for Bland Bland and more Bland this is your place."}
{"text":"Amazing sausage sandwich amazing meatballs cash only is only bad thing but still such cute place    Staff was amazing."}
{"text":"I've lived less than a mile from Geracis for months but only recently tried it for the first time, after seeing it featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.  As far as the pizza goes, it's very good, but not my favorite sit-down restaurant pizza in Cleveland. The pepperoni, which Guy Fieri hyped pretty heavily, was probably the best part. The overall quality of the pie, and I can't put my finger on exactly what, left something to be desired.  The service was very friendly. I didn't mind the seating arrangement that other people here are complaining about. Sure, you have to sit relatively close to strangers, but we do live in a society, we can't be walled off from the world at every moment.  I can see why people love this place. It's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"WOW! Though I live in LA now, I grew up just a couple miles from this place and ,somehow, NEVER managed to get myself there. Don't remember ever hearing about it either. Have driven by it many many times though I feel cheated that I missed this experience as a child!  Went there Saturday night with my mom and some friends. We entered the place and were greeted by a man who said he was the son in law of the Geraci's. I explained that we had never been there before but were really excited to be there because we'd heard so much about the places. I must say that EVERYBODY we encountered on their staff that night was SUPER FRIENDLY, attentive and accommodating! My mom uses a walker and also has some special dietary restrictions of late and they went out of their way to make sure she was comfortable and made several menu recommendations they thought might suit her.  Ok,ok... about the food:   Now, I don't usually eat pork mostly for reasons of personal health. But I'd heard SOOO MUCH about the pepperoni that I just HAD to try a bite or two from my friend's Pizza Deluxe (Pepperoni, Sausage, Mushroom, Green Pepper, and Onion)...I sat there chewing with my eyes closed. Few experiences in my life have been comparable to this one...the only one I can remember is the first time I ever french kissed a girl! OOUUU WEE!! That pizza was DEEEEE  FRIGGIN LICIOUS!! I don't know if it's my lack of vocabulary or the out of this world taste of that pizza that leaves me without words sufficient to adequately describe the taste experience I had! Well, the third option is that I'm just too damn lazy to think that hard about it at 8AM when I've been up really late the night before!  Anyway, you get the picture! My veggie pizza was pretty darn good too. However I think I like my veggies a little bit chunkier than the way they served them here. Also, I HIGHLY recommend trying it with MEATBALLS! WHEW!! Nuff said.  One last thing..if you're a fan of really sweet fried dough desserts, try the Spingi. But if you like a less sweet option, you may want to have something else. These things are rolled in granulated sugar and then covered with powdered sugar. Can you say sugar crash,boys and girls? Mom can't have donuts, so she had ice cream which she immensely enjoyed. We all left satisfied."}
{"text":"Im going to try to be as diplomatic as possible here. First of all, Ministrone Soup is not made with meat at all. Nor is it made with Campbell's vegetable beef soup. Second, an Antipasto salad DOES NOT, repeat DOES NOT have tuna fish in it. If you don't want tuna in yours, order without. There's a dessert called spingi that is little more than fried balls of dough covered in sugar. The pizza is very, very thin.  Next, every restaurant of this caliber takes plastic except Geraci's. Next, there is no wifi. I went home and made me a sandwich after coming here.  I don't think I will be back. Guy Fieri needs to be shot....."}
{"text":"Good was good. A little overpriced. The deal breaker was not taking credit cards. For a sales guy, the expense report is now a pain. I will not return as long as they only accept cash."}
{"text":"Good pizza but personally I think it is overrated from the hype of everyone in Cleveland. I give it a 4 star because they also have great pasta and a large menu where all the side items are fantastic. Their cheesy garlic bread should be part of your order."}
{"text":"YUM, yum, yum!  You definitely have to give this place a try if your near or visiting. They won't disappoint and are  definitely worth the hype."}
{"text":"Geraci's offers, as far as I can see, the best traditional pizza in Cleveland and undoubtedly in Ohio. I can't say that it is the best pizza I have ever had, but it certainly is among some of the better local pizzerias I have been to.   As others have said, the sauce is incredibly good. The dough is fresh and properly cooked. I wouldn't suggest straying away from getting a traditional pepperoni pizza. This is what they do best, and it is damn good.   The first time I went there, I ordered a custom pesto pizza. Unfortunately, it did not turn out quite as lovely as a pepperoni pizza. It had a fishy taste and almost all of the bacon pieces had completely turned to char; I ended up returning it. I decided to give Geraci's another shot and went back for a large pepperoni. I was again impressed with the pepperoni pizza.   I cannot comment on the quality of other items offered at Geraci's, but I can say that as far as a traditional pizza goes, Geraci's does a fine job."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place on the recommendation of friends who are regulars.  I finally got the chance with my Mom and it lived up to every expectation.  We split the Caesar salad, eggplant parm \"appetizer\", and a pizza.  There were leftovers.  the caesar salad was fresh and cheesy.  I wouldn't have minded some anchovies being involved, but it was good regardless.  The eggplant parmagiana appetizer is basically the dish without the pasta.  Amazing, fresh, tomato sauce with nice cuts of eggplant and gooey baked cheese on top.  Then of course the pizza was excellent.  A great meal that my mom and I agreed, even my picky dad would like this place.  We'll bring him along next time."}
{"text":"For my money, they serve the best pepperoni pizza in the world. I've been eating there for about 50 years. Now I make it a point to get one when I'm within 10 miles of the location. They make their own pepperoni and it is perfectly crisp on the edges.   I can't comment on the other food. Make sure you bring cash. There is an ATM available, but why let dumb fees ruin your night."}
{"text":"Amazing, awesome, fantastic....too many great adjectives to describe this place!  Old style Italian venue with true Italian cuisine!  To me the sauce and house salad dressing tell it all about an Italian restaurant and they nailed it with both!  Our Groupon got us there, the food, service and atmosphere will bring us back.  Hands down amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for my birthday dinner with my family - lots of shrimp! While I waited I ordered bread for the table (there is a charge). I ordered the shrimp cocktail and the Fruit d'Mar which was so delicious! My mom ordered me a shrimp, mozzarella, and Romano cheese pizza to-go for my lunch the next day (it doesn't sound good, but it's deceivingly delicious!!!) cash only!"}
{"text":"Great old school Italian . We drove up from Columbus . Wish the accepted credit cards .... But hey ,,,, they are old school right ? Great food . Small inside so come early . Get in here"}
{"text":"CASH ONLY!  Now that that's out of the way... Geraci's serves excellent pizza. It's slightly dough-y but the crust is crispy (like it's been on a pizza stone in a real pizza oven). We got a large mushroom and pepperoni pizza as well as the roasted meat ravioli (the dinner portion) for 3 people and we had a few slides left over, so I'd say it was good portion-sizing. The raviolis were fried crispy and the meat inside (beef) was very tender. The marinara sauce was also very good (fruity and sweet, no spice).  Our waitress was brand new, but very patient and pleasant. I'd go back!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a good local pizza place for a while, and Geraci's is definitely good. It's a bit pricey ($17 for a large pizza about 14 inches across) but it is some of the best. It had a nice chewy crust, tangy sauce and generous cheese. They also have very thick, handcut pepperoni that is much better than those thin, round slices you get on most pizzas.  One warning, they do not take credit cards! Not sure why but I'm glad I stopped at the bank because I did not anticipate how expensive this pizza would be.  I did get takeout, but apparently you can also dine in."}
{"text":"Heads up - they don't take Credit Cards!   But ... it's worth popping over to the ATM.  I love when a mom & pop style restaurant can compete with the plain chains that are taking over the world.  This one truly does - order anything on the menu...it'll be good."}
{"text":"Good pizza, but a little on the pricey side. The seating is very tight (you're basically sitting with at your neighbors table) and this is one of the few cash only restaurants left in the world."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza joints in the region. Fortunate to have it right around the corner.  I don't eat pizza or pasta often, but when I do, Geraci's is one of the go to joints for more than just Domino's."}
{"text":"Moved to the area almost ten years ago, and all we heard about from others was how good Geraci's is.  Ordered a pizza our first night in our house, and was somewhat disappointed.  Willing to give them another shot due to the potential for unrealistic expectations.  Have gone back a few times (once or twice a year), and I can say that I want Geraci's to be more than what it is.  The food is decent, but not great.  The decor is classic, and the service is usually friendly, although sometimes not the most organized.  Just tonight my hot Italian sub did not arrive until we were almost finished.  To their credit, the waitress took it off of our bill (good move that will keep them under consideration for dining choices).  The pizzas can sometimes get soggy very quickly as well, most likely due to the Marinara sauce they use which is very watery.  It's worth a try once if you never have been there, but I wouldn't glowingly recommend it."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant.  We stopped later in the afternoon so it was quiet when we got there.  The server was good, friendly, and prompt.  You should know they do not take credit cards, nor does Bialy's Bagels right across the street, something I do not understand but their base must be large enough that this policy works for them.  All the elements of a tasty home style Italian meal was there except for the over abundance of the olive oil.  Garlic bread is made with real garlic- not powder- but the bread is saturated with oil.  I ordered linguine and clams and the clams were plentiful, but drowned in more olive oil, and they were sandy.  The pasta was past al dente but that would have been ok had there not been so much oil...and grit.  My husband liked his spaghetti, marinara, and meatballs and nearly finished the large portion.  The meatballs have good flavor (lots of Parmesan!) but we're too dense for my taste.  Meatballs are like sauce, very personalized to taste so I would recommend the meatballs anyway.  The dinner salad is nothing special- lettuce, a tiny cherry tomato, and the unnecessary sprinkling of shredded cheese.  I won't write it off but I was disappointed.  However, it's worth a second trip to me.  The neighboring table ordered two pizzas which looked delicious...I would be willing to return to try the pizza."}
{"text":"I guess I should have gotten the pizza, but we had just had pizza the night before. The lasagna that another in my party and I ordered was not very good. I am a big guy and usually don't leave much food behind, but I did not finish this meal...partly because they do give you big portions, but partly because it just wasn't that pleasant to eat. Another in our party felt the same way about an Alfredo dish. In fairness, my wife did enjoy her manicotti."}
{"text":"Pepperoni pizza is out of this world. Definitely has that homemade taste, and the thick slices of pepperoni are unbeatable.   Anything else on the menu is awful. We've tried many other Italian classics, everything was throw-out terrible. Prices are pretty high, cash-only is really annoying, and the lack of parking spaces is also prohibitively annoying.   But the pizza.. yumm."}
{"text":"The first time I went here, I would have given it 4 stars. Since then, I've been let down every time, so 2 is all I can do for now.   The food: For a place reputed to be some of the best pizza in Cleveland, they have really slipped. The pies are sloppy at best. (I've had to cut them myself more than once.) The taste is ok, but nothing I'd say you should go out of your way to get. I'm not sure what happened over time, but I hope they fix it. If you do want to try the pizza, I recommend the pepperoni, that was the one saving grace I've found.   The service: Sketchy at best. I would say I felt like I was bothering them when I went in to pick up my food. Not the kind of attitude that makes me want to go back, or recommend a friend.   The restaurant looks nice inside, a little tight, but that's to be expected in the area. They also don't take credit, so bring cash! They do have a third party ATM in house, but I'm not sure what the fee is.   I really would like to see this place turn it around."}
{"text":"So I've heard people talk about this place being a local treasure and seen the cable show foodies rave about it.  I finally went here to see what everyone was talking about.  I could not have been more disappointed.  It was apparent that the majority of customers were regulars, and we were not welcome.  We were hurried through our meal, not asked if we wanted drink refills, offered boxes for our uneaten food before we asked for them in order for them to use our table for one of their regulars.  Then there is the food.  Pizza was incredibly greasy and the crust was burnt.  I know everyone has their own personal tastes in pizza, but this was bad.  The pasta was not good as well, somewhat bland.  And also, make sure you bring plenty of cash with you, since they don't take credit cards, which is a pain since the food is overpriced.  I will not go back and cannot recommend this to anyone, unless you are a regular."}
{"text":"I wish there was a 3.5 star.. or 3.75 stars. But i'll round it up to 4 stars.  I came to Geraci's for the first time with an ex-roomie. We had heard people rave about this place. Not being a huge pizza fan, I ordered their pasta with marinara. First, there was a long wait and second, I wasn't fully impressed. Yes, the pasta was decent, but it wasn't the way people raved about it. That was about 1.5 years ago and I never went back to Geraci's.  Fast forward 1 year and i heard my coworkers talking about how cleveland is voting for the best pizza in town and everyone was gonna vote for Geraci's. Last night, my boyfriend happened to crave pizza so I suggested Geraci's, wanting to give it another shot.  This time, I really liked it! My boyfriend ordered their deluxe pizza with pepperoni, sausage, onion, green peppers, and mushroom. He thought it was traditional and delicious. He loved the homemade tomato sauce and you could actually feels the chunks of tomatoes in the sauce. The mozzarella had just the right amount and went right around the toppings so it was perfect on the stomach. I, on the other hand, gave their pastas another try and ordered the Linguinie with clam sauce. I really liked it. For one, they gave alot of clams and two, it was rather filling. My only complaint though, was that there wasn't enough taste of a seafood broth. I kind of wish the pasta was just a bit stronger and had more flavors.  However, what really makes me willing and wanting to go back to Geraci's is that everyone in the room is so friendly and it almost feel like one big family in the restaurant. I chatted with a man who sat next to me and another group of case western students. To top of off, the owner (Marty Geraci) came to sat down next to us! Turns out he knew the man next to us and started chatting with us. She was so friendly and so nice and really spoke about the restaurant and how much detail they put into satisfying their customers.  So, I think I will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"$14 for a \"large\" cheese pizza, which by most standards would qualify as a medium is pretty annoying. As for the pie itself, the only saving grace is the sauce which is obviously homemade and reminds me more of a pasta sauce. For my personal taste, the dough is too thick and their is a noticeable layer of grease which adds a considerable amount of guilt. Would only recommend if you're in a real pinch. Otherwise, Marrotta's is a much better pizza experience overall."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY-No reservations! Food is fair and very expensive. But, if your ever in the area on the East side, i highly suggest you try it. hey- it's even been on Diners, Drive and Dives!   Their pizza is your best bet!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is absolutely delicious. Some of the other dishes are very good too, but I would go mostly for the pizza. Good service, nice local family-owned restaurant. Really enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Geraci's is a phenomenal family friendly restaurant with fresh, from scratch Italian cooking.   The Eggplant Parmigiana was melting in your mouth delicious. The pizza was phenomenal, and my kids and I loved it so much that we ordered a second pie.  As out-of-towners looking for a food adventure, we are certainly happy that we went to Drive-ins Diners and Dives hotspot."}
{"text":"My mom grew up in University Heights and this was a staple in her childhood. I then moved here 35 years later and now it's a staple in my life, too.   My husband and I look forward to the nights where we can eat a Geraci's Deluxe Pizza and house salad. The pepperoni is mini and crisped to perfection, then we drizzle their homemade salad dressing all over our plate. Everything tastes delicious with the heavenly dressing all over.  Perfect takeout. The pizza is colorful and made with fresh ingredients and the establishment clearly knows what they're doing if they've been making families happy for decades."}
{"text":"This restaurant EXCEEDED my expectations. The best thin crust pepperoni pizza I've ever tasted (and I'm from Chicago)    Hand sliced pepperonis that are so crispy and almost burnt! I swear it's amazing. The garlic bread is also to die for. I haven't tried any of their Italian pastas dishes yet but they looked incredible to the eye. I will come back often and bring my out of town friends. Also, this restaurant is on Triple D ;)"}
{"text":"Visited Geraci's on a recent trip to Cleveland.  First time since I moved away nearly 20 years ago.  It was as good as I remembered!  We've been looking for a good simple pizza place in Virginia Beach, but haven't found anything that compares.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"My favorite spot for pizza takeout.  Also love dining in and enjoying a bottle of wine with our pasta.  Lovely place"}
{"text":"When I'm traveling I like to hit places that have been on Diner's, Drive-Ins and Dives. That's what brought me to Geraci's in Cleveland.  This [place has been around for decades and run by the same couple, who are now in the late 80's/early 90's. When I watched the episode they focused on the pizza, especially the pepperoni pizza. So that's what I did.  The crust is excellent, but a little thicker than what I normally like. My wife would have loved it. The pepperoni is thicker than usual and really good. The cheese is excellent. But the thing that makes it so good is the sauce. The sauce is homemade with chunky tomatoes and lots of herbs and spices. It's so good I could eat it like a bowl of soup. It would be good on anything.  I will be coming back in a couple of months and my wife will be with me. This will be her favorite pizza for sure."}
{"text":"Best salad dressing: creamy italian on the house salad goes well with pepperoni pie"}
{"text":"We bought a Groupon for this restaurant and came out.   It was very good!   Appetizer was fried artichoke - medium husband said it was great   I had the chicken parm with spaghetti and my husband had the veal parm  gnocchi - both were excellent  For dessert we had coffee and he had tiramisu. The tiramisu was frozen, so obviously not homemade lol  All in all it was yummy!!"}
{"text":"I don't think I have ever had anything here but the pepperoni pizza, but it is the best pepperoni pizza I have ever had.  The pepperonis are thick cut and delicious.  The sauce is amazing.  Yet another reason to move back to Cleveland."}
{"text":"We have been here three different times and each time has been better than the last. The place is always super busy, so I think some of the waitresses and waiters are a bit harried at times, but are always friendly and attentive.   We usually start with the garlic cheese bread which is sliced French bread toasted with garlic butter and mozzarella cheese. It is very good to take the edge off the hunger, and it comes out of the kitchen fast.   The pepperoni pizza is delicious! The pepperoni is thick and flavorful. The crust is just perfect - not to thick and not greasy. We have also ordered the ground beef pizza, which my husband and I felt was kind of bland, but my father and stepmother loved it! I think it appealed to them as they don't like spicy things at all, and it really has the flavor of just pure ground beef on a pizza - no real extra spices or anything.    We have also ordered a meatball to try - comes with a red sauce and is a good size, about 3 in diameter. I read a previous review saying the meatball tasted \"frozen\" and \"rubbery\". I don't agree at all! The meatball was very fresh tasting and delicious. Not rubbery at all. We actually had to order two more because my two year old daughter who doesn't care for red sauce usually and is very hit or miss on \"meep\" (translation: meat) wanted more and more of these meatballs!  We haven't ever ordered pasta from Geraci's, but honestly, the pepperoni pizza is so good, I can't imagine going there and not ordering pizza. So if some of the negative reviews are focused on their pasta dishes, I can't comment on that. I do know that if you want a good, flavorful pizza and darn good meatball, Geraci's is your place!  (Another tip- the wait is often long, so we have sent my husband to stand and wait in the crowded entrance for a table while we go across the street to Macy's or whole foods.  It's a VERY tight entry area without much room to sit, especially with little ones.)"}
{"text":"pizza was pretty good  italian salad bowl could have been better. the veggies were just not fresh.   looked depressing. interior was outdated.   but pizza was okay.   cash only!"}
{"text":"They only take reservations for parties of 8 or more, so expect a wait if you go during traditional dinner hours. Once seated, the service is attentive and everyone is helpful. Don't hesitate to ask anyone passing by for something. They are all eager to assist. Appetizers came out promptly and were delicious. We had ravioli and fried zucchini. The dinner came out right on time and was just as tasty. Overall, i was pleased and would come back."}
{"text":"There are three kinds of pizza joints in this world:  1) Great Pizza - the make your mouth water you're craving it, its so good kind. 2) Good Pizza - it will do in pinch.  Most likely they deliver. 3) Don't eat this pizza - do not under any circumstance eat this pizza, it does bad things to your tastebuds as well as your digestive system.  Geraci's, without a doubt, falls into category number 1 - in fact, its my number one of the number 1s.  Don't be duped, there are other good pizza joints in the Cleve, but this is far and away the best.  Let us explore:  What makes a good pizza?  Two things (Barring serving temperature - which is a personal preference -  and Geraci's is excellent at any serving temperature.):    The Sauce (yeah, that's right, capital \"S\"auce.) and the crust.    The rest, well, honestly, are just toppings. (And Geraci's toppings are AMAZING.  Try the italian sausage or the handcut pepperoni - its the real deal, and its perfect in flavor.)  I've never had a pizza sauce I enjoy more, its slightly sweet and has a very nice tang to it.  The crust hits the chew/crustiness ratio perfectly providing the perfect platform for sauce and toppings.  You just can't go wrong here.  In fact, the crust and sauce are so good that its tempting to order a pie without any other toppings!  My only ding on Geraci's is that it doesn't  take credit cards; where are we, like Italy in 1955 where an old Italian grandma is making stuff in the kitchen?  Actually, the way this stuff tastes, I just might believe that.....(bring cash or check, but there are a few banks just around the corner should you forget)."}
{"text":"My fourth Geraci's experience, now, and I felt the need to update my previous 5-star review with another one.  On a recent visit, as my wife and I were walking in, we were greeted by Fran Geraci, who was sitting outside having a beer.  Just as sweet as last time.  We ordered two small pizzas... the tri cheese and a double pepperoni.  Both were fantastic.  The pepperoni was just starting to burn at its highest points, which adds another dimension to the flavor and texture - neither of which were necessary, but both were welcome.  Service was very good as it has been each time.  Price, nice.  I just haven't been able to find much to complain about that matters, and I'm usually the type to really look hard when a place has been featured on TV or in Cleveland Magazine or something... I'm not a big fan of review inflation because a restaurant is SUPPOSED to be famous and wonderful.  Geraci's just nails it for me.  Like I said in my prior review... \"beer and pizza\" - there is no \"best\" . . . only your favorite.  This is my favorite pizza."}
{"text":"A slice of old school heaven! The restaurant was established in 1956 and has an old school feeling, and even had old tunes playing. My co-worker and I tried it tonight on a work trip, after looking for some locations that Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives had been to in the area. We were not disappointed. The italian sausage on the pizza was awesome, the small and thick pepperonis were great, as were the mushrooms.  I'm not sure what style of pizza it is, maybe just Geraci's. It's not New York, not Chicago, not St. Louis. Is there a Cleveland style? Regardless, I like it and it was finished off nicely with a Peroni beer.  The wait staff was friendly. Do note that this is a cash only establishment.  They have an extensive Italian food menu as well, which had a lot of appealing items on it. I only wish we were here longer, so I could go back and try more. Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"They do not accept credit cards. That was a surprise, but food was wonderful."}
{"text":"I was excited to visit this restaurant after seeing it on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives two nights ago so I went the next day. The parking lot was a bit small but luckly I was there on a Tuesday night so I did find a spot. When entering the restaurant the staff was very friendly and we were seated right away. Once inside the place is not large as half the building was the kitchen and the other half was the dining area but there was plently of space for the crowd that was dining in. We had two appetizers the zucchini fries and the mozzarella sticks. The zucchini fries didn't have much flavor and the sauce that was served with it was runny so it didn't hold the sauce. The pizza was ok. When it first came to the table the crust was crispy by the time I got to my second slice it was getting a little soggy. The cheese was a little bland. Overall it was better than a big chain but not the best I have had."}
{"text":"Geraci's was recently featured on Guy Fieri's, Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives. Now, while I wouldn't consider this place any of the those, I do think this place is worthy of it's recent recognition.    Geraci's has been in business for over 50 years now. The combination of great toppings, passion and friendly service seems to have kept this place a success through the years and is probably the reason why Geraci's has stood the test of time.   Geraci's, primarily known for their Pizza, is most certainly in my top-3 locally favorite pizza joints in Cleveland, with the others being Angelo's in Lakewood and Pizzazz in Mayfield Village & University Hts.  The thing that seems to separate Geraci's from the others is their thickly sliced and extra tasty pepperonis. Along with the pepperonis, the sauce, dough and other toppings are exceptional as well. The menu consists of other Italian traditions such as pasta, meatballs, breaded veal, chicken, Italian Wedding soup and antipasto's. Occasionally I order the antipasto or wedding soup along with the pizza, but I've yet to substitute my pizza with pasta. I just can't resist the wonderful pie from Geraci's. If you live nearby the greater Cleveland area and consider yourself a Pizza aficionado, you certainly owe it to yourself to check out Geraci's."}
{"text":"Pizza was great but make sure you bring cash as they do not accept credit/debit cards.  With that said, they do have an atm they'll direct you to at the front door which charges a $2.75 fee.  Would like to see this place add a credit/debit card option."}
{"text":"Sorry but I was not impressed. Looks like nice neighborhood place with some good character but the food was just so-so.  I had a small sausage pizza, lacked flavor and reminded me of a pizza served at high school.  I also had two meat balls, no flavour, but the sauce was alright."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Italian restaurant.  Not only was this on Diners, drive ins, and dives, or whatever it's called, I have been going here since I was young and make sure that I go here every time I come back to visit.  I even have them overnight me pizzas to Phoenix.  The table bread is great. Butter is always soft.  House salad is fantastic.  Pepperoni pizza is a must and the meat ravioli is my favorite. Make sure you come with cash though.  This is a true Italian restaurant. Cash or check only."}
{"text":"I live in Southern California now,  but am back multiple times a year. And Geraci's  has always been #1 in Cleveland, at least since Teresa's in Little Italy closed. I've eaten pizza everywhere. I'll put Geraci's up against any. It's in the ingredients."}
{"text":"Cash only, which is annoying. The Buffalo chicken pizza cost a premium and only had 2 toppings on it. Will never give them my business again."}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was a child.  Their pizzas are fantastic.  They're Cleveland style, a bit thicker than NY, but not as thick as Chicago.  The sauce is fantastic.  Sometimes the crusts come out not crispy enough for me, so I order them well done.  Ask for extra sauce on the pizza, you won't be disappointed that you did.  I'm not a huge fan of their pastas, and sometimes the cashiers can be a bit abrupt, but whatever.  Their pizzas are where it's at.  Also, it's cash only, so keep that in mind.  They do have an atm in the foyer."}
{"text":"This was my pizza place growing up, it was my family's go to place!! I just moved back after 30 years away, and it is still the best!!! It brings back so many great memories, thanks Geraci's for not changing!!"}
{"text":"From the outside, Geraci's looks like an aging Mom & Pop cafe in a strip mall. The inside is more of the same, except it's like you've gone fallen back into the 70's, and not in a quirky way.   The service was competent, fast, and friendly. Dinner salad was huge and tasty, as was the pizza. I ordered the Pasta Basilico, however, which turned out to be a mistake, as it was bland and nearly devoid of flavor. \"Mmm, it's warm spaghetti with olive oil and basil!\" In Geraci's defence, the flavorless pasta might have more to do with the dish itself. If I ever go back, I'll be choosing an Arrabiata sauce for sure.   I'd give them a 2.5 if I could. Geraci's isn't bad by any means, but there are so many fantastic restaurants in Cleveland that it's hard to justify going back.  NOTE: Geraci's is Cash or Check only, so be prepared."}
{"text":"Recently moved to this side of town and love to try family owned pizza shops. This is terrible. I ordered a Caesar salad (only one size, and it was $9.95?!) that was drenched in dressing and provolone cheese (not even the traditional asiago cheese that usually comes on a Caesar). Why would you make a salad for a to go order and not put the dressing on the side? That's common sense. Additionally, I thought for the price it would be enough to serve 3-4. Wrong. It is enough to serve 2 adults.  On to the pizza: a large cheese (for the kids) and a large cheese and sausage. Both were mediocre at best and the plain cheese pizza had large chunks of onion on it! I'm guessing the onions were part of the sauce, but the kids were complaining because the onions were huge and NOT diced as they should be.   Upon picking up and paying, the young lady behind the register thanked me for my tip before I could even count to make sure I received correct change. Perhaps a lesson in gratitude and common customer service would benefit your employees; I did not leave any tip.  Over $30 wasted in lousy salad and pizza. We won't be ordering from Geraci's again.  I don't understand the hype?!"}
{"text":"Geraci's is our go-to restaurant in the University/Shaker Heights area. The pizza is always amazing and is much better than even the well-known restaurants in Little Italy. We usually do not come during the peak hours, but the service has always been great. It is very family-friendly. My recommendations are the toasted ravioli and the pizza. I have tried a few of the pasta dishes, and they are very good as well. The only negatives that I have experienced (as highlighted in previous posts) are 1) they are cash only (although there is an ATM at the restaurant) and 2) limited parking. Also, in our experience the pizza is much better if you eat it fresh at the restaurant, as opposed to take-out (although the take-out line is always busy, which definitely says something). We will definitely continue dining here on a weekly basis, and I absolutely recommend trying it if you haven't already."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but I'm not a believer in the church of Geraci's pizza.   I've tried cheese pizza. And mushroom pizza. And white pizza. And most recently, a margherita pizza. They were ok...but nothing I'd go out of my way for. My pizza was actually overdone (hello, blackened crust) the past time I was there and despite having fresh basil and seemingly fresh tomatoes, it wasn't all that flavorful.   What do I like about Geraci's? The pasta I've tried is pretty good - especially the spinach ravioli in a tomato cream sauce. Service is always good, too, with the bus boys almost being too attentive. One time I heard one of the servers going out of his way to make accommodations for a guest requesting gluten free pasta, and that made me happy. Servers are also very knowledgeable about what is suitable for a vegetarian like me and what isn't, and that's a welcome change from having to wait while someone runs back into the kitchen to ask a question.   I wish I loved Geraci's pizza as much as everyone else does. But since I don't, my quest for the best pizza in CLE continues."}
{"text":"san francisco has terrible pizza.  find yourself a 5-star pizza joint in SF and anywhere back east its fare will rank a solid 3 (i'm just talking regular new york style here).  thus, when i ended up in cleveland this christmas break, i was super stoked to have me some REAL pizza.  geraci's did not disappoint.  my boyfriend prepped me with food network videos (yes, geraci's was featured) beforehand, but no amount of anticipation could do that pepperoni pizza justice.  deliciously crispy, thick cut pepperoni slices on plenty of cheese and sweet tomato sauce.  THAT is what pizza is!!  oh, and i might add that when i saw the price for a medium, i thought it was going to be a personal pan pizza.  not so, my friends-- welcome to ohio!!  now if only they could move to sf..."}
{"text":"I called in an order for a chicken salad with bacon and eggs.  Upon opening my bag I had salad in 1 container with bacon eggs and chicken in the other.  #sticktopizza #dontsalesalads.  The chicken was bland and the bacon cold."}
{"text":"This place was just packed on Saturday night. Mostly families with children and older (retired age) groups. That's not typically a sign of a place that is going to impress me. But I reserve jugdement until after I eat.  Many people have told me how awesome their pizza is, so that was what I tried. I had a cheese pizza. I'm not in love, but I could see what those people are excited about. It's nothing like pizza store pizza. It has a very natural and fresh tasting pizza sauce and they are quite generous with the cheese. It had great flavor, but was just a little too wet for my tastes.   So, if the pizza is good, why only 3 stars? Well, the prices. We had fried ravioli. For $6 we got four ravioli. That's $1.50 per ravioli. They were good, but c'mon, at least give me 6 of them. I felt a little ripped off. The marina sauce that came with the ravioli was awesome. All of their sauces are awesome. Good food, they just don't hit the sweet spot on value for me."}
{"text":"Lives up to Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives?  Maybe.  I really do like the pepperoni, and the pizza is less greasy than Mama Santa's.  I would say this is one of the better pizza places in Cleveland.  The \"gourmet\" pizzas are all a bit expensive - the best deal is probably the deluxe pizza (pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, peppers, onions) at $18 for a large.   We've also tried the spaghetti here, which was, meh, spaghetti.  The service is a bit sluggish, but okay.  The pizza takes some time to bake.  There was once though that they finished making our pizza and left it on the counter for ten minutes before our waitress realized she was supposed to bring the pizza to our table."}
{"text":"Hands down among the best pizza ever. Their crust is divine, the sauce is homemade chunky and delicious, and the pepperoni - mindblowing. It's that delicious thick amazing pepperoni that gets nice and crispy. Also, if you ask for light cheese, they give you light cheese! in addition, the meatballs are huge, and delectable, the chicken parmesean is cooked perfectly, and their spaghetti sauce has all of those amazing homecooked flavors. it's a family owned restaurant with consistently good food, good service, and a great environment. i HIGHLY recommend it!!  note: they don't take credit card, so bring cash or I think they have an ATM in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Been going here since 1969. Pizza is still the BEST! Service the same! But what's happened to the Geraci Salad bowl it's a $10 salad for 1 now, and really a single pepperoncini. And yes Cash only for those complaining, All you have to do is read!"}
{"text":"I miss Geraci's! It was my favorite pizza growing up and still is, The problem is that I live in CA and Geraci's hasn't moved here to join me.   No one does pepperoni like Geraci's. They don't use pre-sliced wimpy pieces but rather thick cut, real pepperoni with just the right zing. Amazing!  I keep it simple and pure when I'm there... dinner salad with cheese (they pile on the cheese and its yummy) and pepperoni pizza.   Go and have a slice for me, please."}
{"text":"I gave this place three tries. Will not try again. The first time, I had lackluster lasagna. The second time, I had mediocre pizza (it tasted like it was made with cheap ingredients, the crust tasted like cardboard, and the mushrooms were like those cheap things from a can). The third time, I had fettuccine alfredo with chicken. First, they forgot the chicken. Second, the alfredo sauce was not a real alfredo sauce - it was made with flour and was more like a clumpy bechamel sauce. There is no flour in ALFREDO sauce. Truly tasteless. This place is always packed and I don't know why. It's not even cheap. If you're looking for a nice, casual Italian place with loads of good food on the cheap side, look somewhere else. Dino's on Mayfield Rd. near Richmond is better."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Northeast Ohio. It has a thinner pan-style / home-style crust that is slightly crispy on bottom and chewy in the middle with a GREAT (onion-seasoned?) sauce. They either make their own pepperoni or source it locally and it is the best I've had. The decor is nice and you can take your kids to see the pizzas being made while you wait. Geraci's is usually packed on the weekend and seating is limited so reservations are a must. Parking can be tricky, so a lot nearby may be your best bet."}
{"text":"We went here because we had a groupon, would have been much unhappier if we didn't.  The service was mediocre, when we went to pay employees were just sitting around at the front talking, kinda weird.  We ordered fried mozarella which was decent but not that great.  The pizza was ok but I've definitely had better.  I can't really pintpoint it but in summary we won't be back.  It's a cramped space, pricey, and not high quality."}
{"text":"The only thing holding back 5-stars is the service.  The restaurant was sorely understaffed for a Saturday afternoon.  1 waitress was working the whole restaurant and there was another young lady (manager?) who was trying to help as best she could.  Additionally, the waitress was really busy trying to meet the demands of one elderly couple that had to have been the most dificult customers ever.  Even though their food was STEAMING, it was deemed cold by them.  As for the food ... Fantastic.  I have never had such good pepperoni on a pizza.  It was perfectly crisped in the oven.  Their House Italian Salad dressing was very delicious.   LImited parking, but overall a great experience.  Cash Only"}
{"text":"Ordered take out a few days ago. The containers were a bit weird as our dinner salad came in three separate containers. And the wedge salad was put in a container too large and lost its appeal. But i digress, i didnt order for the salads. My fiance and mother in law split the ravioli. For the price they could of added a couple more, but the flavor was great and the Alfredo sauce was tasty. I had the chicken parm dinner. Huge peice of chicken and spaghetti as a side. Very flavorful and filling. Spaghetti was ok, a but too mushy for me. Would probably see if i could get the penne next time. Food was good, priced on the higher side but not outrageous. In need of a quick italian fix, we will probably come back."}
{"text":"Sorry, not a fan.  Spaghetti and meatballs? Ok  Margherita pizza? Ok  White pizza with chicken and ranch? Ok  Service is very unattentive. I expect more from a mom and pop Italian place.  No for me."}
{"text":"They are old fashioned and do not accept credit cards therefore I had to rate them lower.  The food and service is great but groups usually need to use a credit card, just a sign of the times."}
{"text":"As a bambino, Shatangi was afraid of pizza because of how it looked. Geraci's was the place to take family from out of town to entertain. The Pizza dude used to hand toss the dough as a special show for the kids (me included). A NE Ohio staple, Pizza pie at it's best.  Shatangi told you"}
{"text":"A throwback to my favorite pizza joint in all of Ohio.  This place knows what they are doing and boy do they do it right!!  One of my all time favorite activities is going to Geraci's with my brother and sister and chowing down on a well done pepperoni pizza - divinity!"}
{"text":"I'm going to give it a 3...everything was ok, but nothing particularly stood out to me. The ravioli was very average, and a couple bites of my dates entree elicited the same response. And the pizza, which I had pretty high hopes for, was ultimately just a \"meh\"."}
{"text":"Went here over the winter with my girlfriend after seeing the restaurant on food network.  It was lent and instead of getting a cheese pizza I got some baked rigatoni to change things up.  I'm an Italian American, who naturally, has better sauce than anybody else but one of my guilty pleasures is Americanized Italian i.e. white trash Italian i.e. olive garden or equivalent.  The sauce was tasteless and very bland, made me wish I'd gotten the pepperoni pizza and risked having to explain to St. Peter why I had meat on that fateful afternoon...I imagine his response being along the lines of \"it's ok my son, pizza heals all wounds and rights all that is wrong in the world.\" Let's get real, pizza does all of that and then some.  That being said the pizza was fantastic but the whole atmosphere was unbelievable...the owner, yes owner was chewing out an employee over the phone right in the pickup area which was basically in the dining room.  Me and my girlfriend looked at each other and the entire restaurant looked around with that awkward look of \"is this really happening?\" Our waitress informed us it was a common occurrence and I couldn't imagine how she treats her employees.  In retrospect, risk your soul for the pizza cause its that good and avoid the pasta dishes.  We dropped 25 on the table for our waitress because I felt that was a proper tip to have to deal with that kind of owner."}
{"text":"Yet another great discovery in university heights hood of Cleveland  .This old school Italian restaurant had too many choices not that's a bad thing but it makes ordering difficult . I ordered pizza as did the rest of the party ,it was excellent not the best I ever had but easy top five .The gluten free version was the best that person ever ate All in all a great little find."}
{"text":"i've been going here as long as i can remember.  the geraci family is close to my family (mancuso's) so we've always gone to their restaurant.  i LOVE the food.  living in CA, my treat when i go back to Cleveland is going to Geraci's.  however, I WILL be honest and fair.  I've read that some people on yelp! aren't that happy with the service.  it's true.  i've had multiple waiters/waitresses that were super bummy.  one time we went and my uncle joked around with our waitress (he likes doing that) and she seemed super irritated when i felt it would be a cool way to identify that our table was pretty easy going.   that same night, i by accident hit my water with my hand grabbing for a piece of bread and spilled a bit.  our waitress looked SOOOOO mad at me!  totally a mistake.  either or, i do love the food.  my FAVORITES are the toasted ravioli and the chicken parmesan.  HOWEVER, i think the Geraci's sauce gets a 6 out of 10.  and the meatballs get a 5 out of 10.  maybe i'm picky because i'm italian and can make my own...but i still love Geraci's.    minus a star for the bummed out wait staff and the mediocre sauce.  i still love you."}
{"text":"This was our 3rd and last time at Geraci's. The last time we ordered takeout and they told us an hour. When we got there the wait was even longer.  Which made the fact that the pizza we ordered was doughy/raw in the center. We figured it was a Saturday night ... it happens. But I didn't appreciate after an hour having to put the pizza in the oven we got home.  Tonight we ate at the restaurant. There were 4 of us plus a baby = 5. They sat us at small table that could maybe sit 4 but there was nowhere really to put the baby chair (we bring our own that attaches directly to the table) because we were on top of the people next to us.  The hostess did realize her mistake and moved us to a larger table, which was nice.  That was the lats nice thing.  The server was bad... unattentive and not friendly. Not a good combo when when that's the majority of your earningsis based on.  I waited tables for 7-8 years. I get having a bad night. But this was guy was just not good and Im guessing he is like that all time.  Although there seemed to be younger teenage girls running around clearing plates, they were nice and kept our table clear and at least checked on us.  The server never brought us water refills, no new silverware until we tracked one of the girls down, had to waive him down for napkins... you get the point. Anyways, the food.  The salads that came with the meals. Eh... whatever. Lettuce and cheese.   My husband ordered the Eggplant Manicotti. Decent flavor, I like the sauce but the eggplant itself was soggy.  It was fine, nothing to write home about.  My mom got the veal parm sub.  It looked dry and tough, which my mom confirmed it was.  I ordered a pizza.  When the pizza arrived, the whole center was soggy and raw.... AGAIN.  We sent it back to have it baked again.  The server returned with my pizza after everyone else was done eating.  It was better but not worth it.  He wasn't even apologetic about the bad pizza or the wait. At least fake it.  There are soooo many better Italian places that it is not worth ever going back."}
{"text":"Finally, FINALLY, went to Geraci's with a small group to try this 'Cleveland Famous' pizza on a random Thursday night.  It was the next place picked by our little dining group to try and the anticipation was killing us.  We were greeted at the front door and seated immediately.  Seating accommodates up to 7 adults comfortably, at least it sat all of us and 1 baby.  The table gets a little crowded but that was partially our fault for ordering sooooo much food.  Everything we ordered came out as it should, apps first, then the pizza.  Beer and wine refills were a little late as was the plates and silverware, but that's partially our fault because our group came in batches (still within a 15 minute window).  Now back to the food.  DRINKS:  Beer - Coolers must be set at 50 deg. F, not very cold.  Ranged from $4-$6, little expensive for domestics.  Wine - Varied from $6 - $10 where the bottle was 4 X that cost, think that the bottle price would be a little less, but no go here.  APPS: Antipasto Platter - Good, presented in a bowl, like a salad, but was packed full of meat and cheese set on a bed of lettuce with a side of dressing $9.  We passed it around and everyone seemed to enjoy.  Meatballs - As seen on TV being made, were as big as advertised.  The general consensus was that they were really good.  My taste in meatballs must be skewed because I like my 'balls' with a dense filling and not one overly powering taste.  There was a seasoning in these that just didn't win me over.  The flavor overpowered the sauce (which is tasty by itself).  Fried Cheese Ravioli - These were standard, nothing really 'amazing' but was a great addition to the slew of apps that we ordered and I would get again.  Stuffed Peppers - By far my favorite appetizer.  Peppers not too spicy, filling / cheese / sauce work perfectly together.  It's a little spicy for kids but perfect for adults with that Scoville spot that needs tickling.  PIZZAS: (Ranked in order, worst to best) Pesto Pizza -  Seemed dry.  Weird to say and hard to imagine, but since Pesto is so flavorful, I can see how its hard to not use too much, but I think maybe a little more cheese would have helped.  All diners agreed.  Toppings were great.  2 out of 5 stars. $25 is WAY too much to spend on this pie.  White Chicken Pizza - This was a favorite of some, but not mine.  It came in a solid second place and would be on my short list of reordering.  Went with the onions instead of artichokes, smart move, went very well together.  Not overly garlicky and didn't make you feel like a big turd as you would after eating a plate of Alfredo.  3 out of 5 stars.  $25 is still a little steep in my eyes.  Pepperoni Pizza - I was reading reviews and couldn't go without ordering the pepperoni pizza, straight up, no additional toppings.  Once again, fellow Yelpers didn't let me down.  The pepperonis got that little burnt crispy edge effect that I absolutely love.  Out of the three pies, this one was the big hit, 4 stars out of 5.  Nice sauce / cheese ratio.  $15 was worth it.  I'd come again but would ask for double pepperoni, you will thank me later.  The pepperonis are small, probably 1\" or so in diameter and you don't get one in every bite.    So overall I came in with high expectations and left with feeling like someone just stole $20 out of my wallet.  Our tab came to $190 before tip, $31 or so per person after tip, and none of us felt like we just dished out $30 for dinner.  I was still a little hungry and so was the wife.  I honestly think that if you must go, then go to knock it off your bucket list of restaurants but expect the 'Seen on TV premiums'.  And for the love of God, GET EXTRA PEPPERONIS!!  Hint:  Started really filling up around 7:30 even on the night of Steelers / Browns game."}
{"text":"Had the regular pie, a meatball, and a wedge salad. Pie is 4 stars, meatball is 5 stars, and the wedge is 3. So there ya have it."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant and no crowd at lunch time. We shared a pizza and garlic bread. The pizza was very thin (which isn't my favorite) and was good, but pretty basic. The garlic bread was like Texas Toast but burned on the edges. This isn't a restaurant we will be excited to visit often, but in an area where most restaurants are packed, it was nice to get in/out without a wait."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Not exactly new York style as the crust is stiffer n crunchier but good pizza just the same. And EXCELLENT service from my waitress. She saw I wasn't thrilled about half my pie having over done cheese n crust and she cut the pie into two and said I'll be back with a small pie baked right. Now that's attention to the customer. I don't see that too often. I'm definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"Second trip is from Cinci and nothing but awesome again. House salad and a small pepperoni and sausage pizza with a little extra sauce. Perfect! Service and ambiance were great with prompt delivery to my table as expected.  Thank you and I will see you again soon. BTW of you get down near my are of the state try Pizzaria Vitale in Fairfield Township. Another old school chain with a delicious history."}
{"text":"I know that many locals rave about this place, but I just don't see it to be honest.  We had spaghetti and sausage and an order to cheese ravioli.  The kids split a sausage pizza.    The spaghetti sauce was somewhat bland, as was the sausage.  Not much flavor at all.  The ravioli was OK, nothing spectacular.    The pizza looked delicious when it came out and the kids loved it.  My wife and I were just not impressed.  The sausage may have been the same that was with my pasta, lacking in flavor.    I will say our waitress was very good!  Not being from Cleveland, I would probably not come back."}
{"text":"Pepperoni pizza cooked well done was so good. The only thing I would warn is it is a cash only place. Well worth it."}
{"text":"Apparently they don't accept credit cards, I had no cash on me so had to use their ATM and pay a fee. I told the head pizza chef I understand the whole nostalgic cash only thing but it's 2016 and you should really accept credit cards. He then turned his back like a child then mumbled we've been doing it like this for 60 years. That's great the Italian old fashioned family running the place is stubborn but get over your selfs.   Never ordering anything from here again and will advise anyone I know the same."}
{"text":"Geraci's is a really solid restaurant if you're looking for some pizza. I've only ever gotten take-out, and I've never had a problem.   Their sauce is not too sweet, which is just how I like it. Their pepperoni pizzas are definitely my favorite.   Geraci's is always a great choice if you're craving Italian. Just note, they only take cash so come prepared.   P.S. Can I hate any restaurant that has the DDD seal of approval? Every time I step through the door and see the Guy Fieri poster I know I'm in the right hands."}
{"text":"The pizza is great here and I love supporting local businesses. I've come here a lot and recommend it to everyone. The only issue I had with this one visit was with the woman answering the phone and taking orders on Halloween night. When I came in to pick up my pizza, I witnessed her being rude and demeaning to her staff, who were very clearly afraid of her by their actions. Telling her employees they were screwing things up (after a customer had grabbed an incorrect bag) and really not being super polite on the phone. Sad to witness and not something I was thrilled about supporting."}
{"text":"So my wife calls me at 9:00 AM at work and says, \"Do you know where Geraci's is?\"  I said, \"No\".  She said, \"Well, we're going there for dinner!\"  I said, let me look it up on Yelp!  She, along with my sister and all of our kids, picked me up from work and off we went.  Upon arrival, all nine of us were promptly seated in a booth that we fit perfectly in to.  We ordered drinks and then our pizza.  We ordered three large pizzas: one with cheese, one with half cheese and half sausage, and one with half deluxe and half pepperoni.    We saw this restaurant on Diners Drive-ins and Dives recently, so that's why my wife was so excited to try their pizza.  The place was very busy.  Every seat had someone in it and it's not a large establishment.  We could see the chef tossing scratch-made pizzas and we learned that they make their own sausage.  According to Guy Fieri, the pepperoni tastes awesome.  So we had to try some.  It turns out that they get their pepperoni shipped in twice per week directly from Italy!  Can you say, \"Autentico\"?  Once the three pizzas arrived, they looked and smelled delicious.  All three fit on our table, can you believe it?  In a matter of 15 minutes, they were all gone.  No more pizza!  Vanished.  Yes, we ate every bit of it.  And it was good.  Real good.  Is it better than Hound Dog's Three Degree Pizza in Columbus, Ohio?  No.  But it was up there.  Oh, and don't forget your cash.  They don't take credit cards and this is clearly stated at the bottom of the menu.  They do have an ATM machine right by the front door though, so don't go running out the back door if you forgot your debit card.  Great pizza!  Recommend!"}
{"text":"9:30 Friday and didn't feel like cooking! Ordered my small sausage pizza and it was hot and ready when I arrived. Still one of the best pizza places on the east side. I enjoyed every bite! Whenever friends come from out of town a must stop is Geracis."}
{"text":"We were unimpressed in our visit there a year ago, so we tried it again this week with the same results.  I really, really wanted to like the place as its been around forever and is close to home.  Unfortunately, other than the pizza, there's not much to recommend here.  And with many of the meals ranging from $17-22, their price point is way higher than the quality. The quality has not changed while the competition in the area has gotten better, so they need to step up their game.  The Caesar salad was good, but the dressing was applied with a heavy hand and the grape tomatoes in a Caesar was out of place.  For the price, the size was not generous.  I ordered the Shrimp Francais and asked the waitress about it first and she said it was good.  It came drenched in a thick, lemony sauce with just a hint of garlic.  I should've returned it, but I ate 2 and the other 3 people in our party agreed it was not to be ordered again.  My son's Italian sandwich was on a very thick piece of mediocre bread - no crispy crust or chewy center, but just very much like wonder bread shaped like a hoagie.  The lasagna was good, but the side of spaghetti was overcooked to the point of mushy and the sauce was not appealing.  The two others at our table also had a side of spaghetti and we all had the same opinion.  Again, I really wanted to like this place, but will only come back pizza."}
{"text":"Geraci's is good homemade pizza.  Location: If you are coming from the south, you'll have problems.  There is no left turn light onto Bushnell so you are going to be sitting there for a long time waiting to turn into the lot.  There is also not much parking in this small strip mall, but at the time I went, people were parking at the dental office in the same lot.  I went on a Saturday, but I thought I went early enough (5:30PM) to beat the Saturday night rush, but I was wrong.  Every table was full and there was about a 20 minute wait.  Several people were waiting for takeout as well.    The girl at the front didn't see me come in, and I didn't know you had to go get on a list (there was a line at the door so I just waited on the line) so there was a potentially awkward situation where someone who came in after me got on the list before me.  The seating is a little tight, so be prepared to squeeze in between tables to get seated.   I ordered a pepperoni pizza and added a single meatball in sauce on as a side (their meatballs are baseball-sized).  Both were delicious and I would readily order either one again.  The pizza was a nice thin crust with excellent sauce and cheese.  The homemade pepperoni was well prepared, and you could tell the whole pizza was made with top notch ingredients.    Pro tip: People in Ohio seem to eat pizza with a fork and knife.  Try not to freak out if you see this.  On the flip side, they didn't throw me out of the place for picking up my pizza and eating it with my hands like a slob."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good and if that is all that they sold they'd get 4.5 stars from me. The pasta, salads and apps (particularly the fried ravioli) is forgettable and unnecessary.   Come here for a good pizza and bring cash as they don't accept credit cards."}
{"text":"Fabulous pizza and meatballs. We were visiting from out of town and checked the food network Diners, Drive-INS and Dives for recommendations. This was awesome. We had the pepperoni pizza which was nice and spicy not greasy, great crust too."}
{"text":"The girlfriend and I ventured here one night in the hopes to find a new quality restaurant near our house. We had read good reviews online and saw that it was a favorite of Guy Fieri. Apparently, Guy Fieri doesn't know what he's talking about. I can only base this off of my one visit to Geraci's, but I found nothing redeemable about the restaurant. The service was slow and the food was bland. I had the veal pram and is was a big let down. The meat just seemed to be low quality and was not tender in any sense of the word. Next time, I'll make the further drive to Little Italy."}
{"text":"It is still one of the best in the area. I enjoyed it more when I was younger. I was hyping it up to a friend at work, so we drove 25 minutes to get there on lunch. My friend was unimpressed. He rated it a 6 or 7 on his scale. I think there are better places to go for pizza. A lot of the menu items are really good. I just don't think they are good enough for me to drive all the way out to the east side for them. Unless I am really bored."}
{"text":"I went there last night with my good friend E.J.  We are very discriminating when it comes to Italian food-- ( I.e.picky) and didn't hold back. She got the lasagna, I got the cavateli, and we both got salads, cheesy garlic bread. I also got a gin and tonic, which I order in an annoying way every where I go- gin on the rocks, tonic back (on the side). E.J. also got a cannoli. This food was so good, I didn't know if I should eat it, or just rub it all over my face. You know what I'm talking about. My cavatelli was so fabulous, and there was so MUCH of it, I swear my nonna was in the back. E.J hoovered hers down like Trump was deporting her tomorrow. And, the server brought my drink to me just like I asked. The cannoli looked great, but I couldn't think about it. I was too jammed full. I want to tell you to go there, go there right now!! But, I want to be able to get in whenever I want. But, as a good person it's my duty to tell you, go. The pizza looks great, too. Do this-- get the pasta there and get pizza to go and freeze it. Unless you live close. If that's the case, good luck. A year from now they're going to be cutting you out of your house."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on FlavortownUSA when we were passing through. I absolutely LOVE pizza, but am pretty picky with my cheese to dough ratio!  I read reviews that the pepperoni pizza was the \"must try\", I was surprised that such a simple pizza would be the best, so we also asked the waitress what pizza she recommended - also the pepperoni!  So of course, we ordered the large (we wanted leftovers!)  It was WONDERFUL!  The pepperoni is not the typical thin sliced variety, it was thick cut, not too greasy and slightly charred. The cheese to dough ratio was perfect - not too much cheese, not too much dough!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Wow. People are very picky about their pizza. I'm usually so hungry (due to my chipmunk metabolism) that i will wolf down just about anything thrown in front of me. Good quality for a food review. But i do remember thinking this pie was above the ordinary. I\"m all about the vibe, though. Here, it was a very \"mob bosses in track suits planning a hit\" vibe. As an I-talian, that kind of scene always reminds me of my childhood. Old people gesturing wildly with their hands and speaking some dialect only fifty people even knew back in the old country. Playing boring card games and drinking cognac their cousin bought at the duty free the last time he came to America to play boring card games. Listening to music that wasn't quite opera or folk...folkera? Anyhow, I like most mom and pop Italian spots. No chains (olive compost heap garden) for me. Mama Santa' s in little Italy comes to mind, too. Anyplace that has a menu featuring a map of the motherland and the town where the restaurant' s founders came from is always good eatin'. If i lived closer, i' d probably go more often. If you do live close, go now."}
{"text":"Service is well here. I honestly wish the bread was warm when I got but I guess they serve it cold. I had some pizza and it was delicious. Best homemade pizza around....better than Pizzazz (; Great atmosphere besides this od lady that kept looking at me while I ate. Great for family and friends!!! I recommend you come and eat at Geraci's.   P.S THEY DON'T ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS OR ANY CARDS FOR THAT MATTER! We went up to pay and they told Anna and I we had to go get cash from a bank cause their ATM was broke. It would have been nice if they told us in advanced that  they don't accept credit cards."}
{"text":"I loved my meal at Geraci's, but there are a few improvements that can be made.  First of all, the place is absolutely tiny!  There was a long wait, which is fine, but there's basically no room to actually sit and wait.  The tables are so close together, I felt like I was eating with a bunch of strangers.  Also, there's no hostess station so you have to make sure you catch the guy taking names so other people don't jump ahead of you in line.  Now onto the good stuff.  My mom and I split a large pepperoni sausage pizza.  The pepperoni is a nice, thick cut type and the sausage is homemade.  We also added feta and they didn't just put a few little clumps on there.  They put tons of feta on there, which made up for the cost of adding an extra topping onto an already kind of expensive pizza.  As for the pizza itself, it was delicious!  I can't imagine finding a better pizza in Cleveland!  We also ordered some tiramisu and the waitress gave it to us for free because it was so busy and we had to wait awhile!  The place is tiny and packed, but the pizza is well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite pizza in CLE.  The pepperoni-sausage is legendary, and was even featured on the Food Network on Triple D. The pepperoni is insanely savory and the sausage crumbles pair well with the pepperoni.  The restaurant itself is like any strip mall Italian themed restaurant, the decor is past it's prime, and the dining room is on the smallish side.  They offer a full Italian menu, but all I can attest to is the pizza, the meatballs (amazing) and the stuffed peppers (spicy, and darn good). There is something about their red sauce that makes everything fantastic. Geraci's will even half bake a pizza if you ask them so you can finish it at home, which is something I have done from time to time as I live 10-15 mins away from the joint.  Two notes, they don't deliver, and they only take cash.  They are opening a new location minutes from me in Pepper Pike, and I am really looking forward to it."}
{"text":"This place is like a part of my family. My dad has been going since he was a boy in the 60's. My parents had their first date here and we return for holidays and special occasions when the family gets together- Or if anywhere nearby we always make an excuse to stop. We have left a pizza box on my grandmothers grave it's that epic. I even went abroad for a semester in Italy and begged my parents to bring me here straight from the airport because I missed it that much!!!! Pasta sauce is delish- and I'm picky about that kind of thing. The pepperoni pizzas are the star of the show-and the big chefs salad with heavenly house dressing is great for dipping. Real chunks of tomatoes in the pizza sauce, little pepperonis that curl up and get toasty in the ovens, fresh bread. Great lasagna too.  For ambiance don't let the small slightly outdated space fool you-I'm an interior designer so I usually really care about appearance- but this place has authentic charm you can't get anymore and it's quite intimate and romantic. Bring cash but they have an ATM too"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in Cleveland. I have been coming here for over 20 years. You can't go wrong with the Deluxe Pizza well done. Chicken Francaise is a can't miss here. Great staff with terrific owners. Cheers to another 20+ years."}
{"text":"If I were only reviewing the pizza, this place would get a full five stars, but unfortunately, I have to rate based on all the food our party tried.  A group of four of us recently visited and were pumped based on what other people had said. I ordered the cavatelli with the Geraci's sauce, as did two of the other people in our party. The fourth got an Italian sub. We also ordered the mozzarella sticks, salads and a sicilian red pizza to share, and spumoni and cannolis. Here's the breakdown:  Mozz sticks: really great. Sauce was good and the outside of the triangles was crispy with a cheesy, gooey inside.   Salads: your typical salad, but we ordered the 'house dressing' and it was just a lot of oil with a little red wine vinegar. No seasonings or anything. If you're going to call it a house dressing, it needs to be more than simple oil and vinegar. Plus, the oil to vinegar ratio was off and it was greasy.  Cavatelli - not homemade and the special 'Geraci's sauce' was not good at all. None of the three of us that ordered it thought it was good. Both the sauce and the pasta tasted bland. When making pasta, you need to salt the water like it's the Mediterranean or your noodles will be bland. Like in this case. And with the sauce, there was no seasoning whatsoever. Really a disappointment.  Sicilian Red: Amazing. If you want a real, actual Italian pizza that hasn't been Americanized, get this one.   The sub: While I didn't try it, my friend said it was dry and that the bread was rock hard. He didn't like it at all.  Spumoni: It was awful. You could tell it was old. The ice cream was actually gritty it was so old. I get this probably isn't a huge selling item, so it probably sits around in the freezer. Either buy it in smaller batches or don't offer it at all on your menu.  Cannoli: Really great. I mean, this is how it should be done.  In summary, be careful what you get here and bring cash because they don't take cards. That kind-of stinks."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the country. I have an aunt who lives in LA who gets 5 frozen pizzas from Geracis to fly back to LA with every time she's in Cleveland....that's how good it is. It's been around for 100 years for a reason.  There are plenty of better cities for pizza than Cleveland (obviously), but you will never taste pizza as good as Geracis. Everything else on the menu happens to be fantastic as well... I'll put their Spaghetti w/ meatballs and their salads up against anyone's. The owners are blatantly miserable, mean, and rude - why some might complain of the service - but it's a part of the mystique. Don't read too much into that... the actual service is flawless always. If you arrive at 6 PM with a party of 6 obviously there's going to be a wait... the place is amazing, what do you expect? This is a 5 star establishment hands down."}
{"text":"They could have the best pizza in the world - the fact that in 2016 they don't take credit cards means they must be a front for something..."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for pizza in Cleveland. Along with Mama Santos and Romeo's, it is always a good bet. Try their home made sausage on your pizza, awesome! Nice people, great staff. A Cleveland culinary institution."}
{"text":"I really wanted this to be my new favorite local joint when a pizza craving hits. Unfortunately, it misses the mark. The crust was dry, too little sauce, and the cheese tasted processed. There is a lot of hype over this place... I don't understand it. We ordered the antipasto salad and it was dry, and contained barely any toppings! Lettuce with a few peppers.   We ordered carry out, but the restaurant seemed nice inside when I went to pick up... it was larger than I had expected. Had that old Italian kitchen feel.   They don't take credit cards though, which makes it even less likely that I'd return often."}
{"text":"A friend of mine introduced me to this place a few years ago. I grew up on the west side of Cleveland and had never heard of this place. I absolutely love the pizza here, it's fantastic. Make sure to stop by the bank and grab some cash, no credit cards. Whenever I make it to the east side, I always try to stop in."}
