{"text":"The fact that there are no yelp reviews for this place is an example of the great low key vibe to be found here. Just an awesome, friendly neighborhood joint; I'm sad it took me so long to discover it. Their food is wonderful too!"}
{"text":"We walked in looking for something to eat for lunch and it turns out this was the first day they were serving their new brunch menu. We had the Tasty Toast and the Sam Frenchie and both were excellent. The waitress was super nice, and we had a great conversation with the owner about all the little details that go into each dish. We're definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Really friendly staff and amazing coffee. Great atmosphere inside and they have live music!"}
