{"text":"They make a good brandy old fashioned, but otherwise I am not a fan. Like a previous reviewer, I am also grossed out by tartar sauce that has been sitting out for who-knows-how-long. And the fish fry? I really don't see any greatness there.  Cave-ish interior, average clientele age of 75--really not my scene."}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill.  IF you can get a drink (last time I was there, they served their regulars at the bar and totally ignored me repeatedly until I finally asked a waitress how to get a drink at the bar.)  The fish fry has been out of rye bread the last two times, and the time before that, it was stale.  Also, the breading falls off of the cod, and the perch must be coming from a different distributor, as it is extremely fishy tasting.  Coleslaw was good - they must be using the same recipe for that.  Too bad- I used to really look forward to dining here."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Friday nite fish frys in Madison. It's always packed so be prepared to wait and have a drink before dinner. The bartenders know how to make their drinks. The dirty martini is my fav. I usually get the baked cod and my fianc√© orders the breaded lake perch. None of that heavy battered fish served here thankfully."}
{"text":"I thought that if I had to wait an hour to eat a simple Friday fish fry, it would be worth it... I was utterly wrong. I got the cod and the rest of my family got the all you can eat perch. I thought my cod was adequate but rather tasteless and in need at salt. When I tried my brother's perch, I was HORRORFIED! It tasted fishy and disgusting! The tartar sauce had too much cool whip, and our server never checked on us. The only good thing I have to say about this restaurant is that the fish came in less than 2 minutes. But, I'll never be eating here again."}
{"text":"At first, I loved the Esquire Club for how old-fashioned its style and clientele were.  This is the closest I've had to a Wisconsin supper club, and in the winter, it seems especially comfy.  But, the food -- outside of a couple items -- is really substandard.  Never, ever, ever, get a \"broiled\" icelandic cod, it comes charred to a crisp.  The lake perch is fine.  But, that's about it, really.  Simple presentation and simple food, but it never elevates to the level of being phenomenal."}
{"text":"Held a work lunch there, and they were great.  We used a room in the basement. We ordered off the regular lunch menu, the food was good, we had fast service and they let us take our time.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"The only reason you should be at the Esquire Club is for your Grandma's 79th Birthday.   They leave the tarter sauce on the table for hours until it begins to yellow.  They recommended the homemade ranch, but should've stuck to Hidden Valley.  
When we asked about our missing drinks about 45 minutes after ordering them our waitress said, \"Oh yes, the drinks have been waiting at the bar for twenty minutes.  I'll go grab those.\"   Decor- hideous."}
{"text":"The fish fry is seriously overrated and the quality is inconsistent. The fish options are limited to ocean perch, cod and lake perch. No bluegill or walleye? There are much better places in town for fish fry."}
{"text":"Outstanding meal every time. Service is is good and I love the vintage \"supper club\" feel to the place. We've dined at the bar as well as the dining room. Excellent dinner!"}
{"text":"Our favorite fish fry in Madison--in an old-school 'Sconnie supper club.  There is more seating than there is parking, so don't despair if you have to park on the street.  If you and your friends all order the all you can eat perch it's served family style--huge plate of fries and fish.  nom."}
{"text":"Fish fry was over cooked and greasy. People seem to like it here so maybe I just had it on a bad day."}
{"text":"My wife and ate there tonight. Food so so. Service not good. Efficent but not friendly. I had the feeling she wanted to be somewhere else"}
{"text":"We had the family style fish fry...very tasty! The food came out quick and the staff was very friendly. Even if we were the only ones there who didn't get a senior discount... Lol also we were sweating by the time we left ... A/C pleaseeeee!?"}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to a Friday night fish fry and picked this place out of all possible locations in Madison. Figured that they have been around so long, that the service combined with quality of menu items could be nothing less than perfect.
We had pre booked a table of 12. We stood around outside the women's bathroom for 40 minutes before we were seated. There was coleslaw and bread already on the table when we sat down. Drinks were ordered promptly. Orders were then taken 20 minutes later. Despite asking the manager 3 times for an update on where our food was, it was over 1 hour and 20 minutes before the first piece of fish arrived. 
Had the perch. Not a lot of fish, mostly breading. One of the people at our table ordered the walleye. Good move as it was a very large piece and after stealing a bite, very delicious.
Will not be returning"}
{"text":"Friday night fish fry- AYCE for about $11.00. I highly suggest making a reservation- this place is packed to the gills. There's a huge bar in the main room, decent bartenders and reasonable priced drinks. We waited about 20 minutes past our reservation because there was a large party being served, but onced we had a drink in hand, the wait was tolerable. 

Seated, we were happily surprised to see how efficiently they run their fish fry- the tables were pre-set with a bowl of tartar sauce and a family-sized bowl of cole slaw, plus a basket with several slices of really tasty rye bread. 

Three of us enjoyed perch family-style, with fries and it was really good- a lightly breaded well-cooked platter of perch and fries was easy to share with friends.  

Looking around, it was a good mix of north and east-siders with an average age of well under 60, on the low side for a supper club.

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Finally, a place that you can take your grandparents and parents to dinner or just all of your friends!  Thank you for sticking around all these years.  The fish fry is spectacular and you don't have to beg for tartar sauce that they charge you $1/cup for, because there is a giant bowl of tartar sauce and coleslaw when you sit at your table.  The bread they serve is delicious and not just a bun in a bag.  It is just refreshing to be able to enjoy a fish fry that everyone can enjoy.  The service is just as good as the food and believe me, that is hard to find nowadays.  i probably shouldn't give such a great review, because now I will never get a table on Friday night.  Oh well, they deserve every patron and every person deserves to splurge on themselves and their family every now and then,  Get 5 star service and food, right here in town."}
{"text":"OMG!  Here for St. Patrick's Day, best corned beef and cabbage ever!  Absolutely delicious!  We did have a longer wait than we were told but it was a very busy night.  Despite other reviews our food was not cold when served."}
{"text":"The Esquire Club is one of our favorite restaurants in Madison. We have had dozens of meals there. Never disappointed with the food.. Always provide friendly and prompt service. Prices are very reasonable and portions are generous. The quintessential Madison area, family owned supper club. Their clientele is clearly very loyal and for good reason.

The fish fry is excellent, particularly the lake perch and walleye. The great news is that these items are also offered on the daily menu along with their many other customer favorites.

When I was young my grandparents owned a tavern and grocery in a small Wisconsin town north of Watertown. It was not a restaurant but people came from miles around for the Saturday night lake perch fish fry. It was awesome! I have loved lake perch ever since and rarely pass if it is on a restaurant menu. After decades of searching I finally found THE ONLY restaurant that comes close to matching the quality and taste of that wonderful family lake perch recipe. Kudos!

Fun and relaxing place for Saturday morning breakfast.

Must visit for corned beef; particularly on St. Patrick's Day. Before moving to Madison a few years ago my wife and I would drive 5 hours round trip simply to enjoy Esquire's St. Patty's Day experience. Second to none.

Keep up the great work!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Being early eaters, think grandma and grandpa early bird, we went at a spur of the moment.  We were seated right away.  My wife was grumpy because she wasn't expecting to come to the Esquire Club.  But she changed her mind quickly.  I'm more of a beer drinker, but my wife decided to try the old fashioned, which is why she changed her mind ;) .  We ordered the fish fry, and while it can be hard to screw this up (I have experience fish fry fail!)  this particular evening did not fail.  The breading was good, properly seasoned, and portion size was respectable and satisfying.  Despite being fried, it was not greasy.  Service was great.  John was courteous, funny and professional.  I am a fan and so is my wife, and we will be back.  We are eager to try prime rib night!  Date night will be fun!"}
{"text":"the last time I attempted to eat here was not good. previously food was okay so wanted to try again. this time food was non existent. sat for twenty minutes in a half empty restaurant without being acknowledged. got up and left."}
{"text":"Old-timey fern bar with a fish fry like you used to enjoy with Grandma.  Like the other reviewers, I order the ocean perch which comes family style with crinkle-cut fries!    This place is so good I make the destination of my twice-yearly meat craving!  (That's right - I consider fish meat.)  Don't sweat the wait you are likely to encounter (even if you and Gram get there at 4:30).  The bartenders make a delightful spicy Bloody Mary, which helps add to the overall feeling that have I reached retirement age."}
{"text":"Headed here for a late meal on a Sunday night. Turns out it was a Packer Sunday night football Sunday night, so the dining room only had one other party, but the bar was pretty packed. The staff was a little pre-occupied with the game and the folks in the bar and the single waitress for the dining room was running herself a little ragged. 

Our meal came with soup and salad - the salads were typical pre-dinner and perfectly ok. The soups left a lot to be desired. We had one of each - cheeseburger and turkey pot pie - both lacked flavor and they weren't worth the space they'd take up in our tummies. 

Our steaks themselves were gorgeous. Both looked bigger than the 12oz we ordered and they were well cooked. However, we'd ordered fried onions to accompany them and my fried onions were burnt to a crisp. I had to scrape them to the side and eat around them to make sure their flavor didn't alter the taste of my steak. 

In the end, it was a good, filling meal for a really good price, but it's not like I'll be jumping to head back."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I sat at the bar with a bunch of buddies for a game rather than actually sitting in the dining room so the comments about poor service may be legit. 

However, if you're looking to judge just the burgers and steaks they were great. Solid atmosphere with three big screens around a bar, the place is admittedly for an older crowd but they were very accomadating when six 24 year olds strolled in for a game."}
{"text":"My semi-local friend thought nothing would be more authentically Wisconsin than a Friday Night Fish Fry. After overdosing on spam & corned beef hash for the past week, I was down for something local so I gladly obliged. 

Wood-paneling and dim lighting make the main bar warm & inviting. Packed with locals, which is always a good sign. Strong brandy old-fashioned. Only downer was the downstairs dining area--kinda felt like a church bingo hall.

Soft, tender & delicious bread, oddly sweet coleslaw. Fried cheese curds were good--moderately breaded, not greasy, smooth texture but not squeaky. Family style ocean perch was satisfying but not memorable. Un(der)seasoned but not greasy, breading a little thicker than desired. Crinkle-cut fries were great but also needed salt. Tartar sauce was a little too heavy on the mayo. Still ate a ton and didn't have room for dessert.

Overall, excellent deep frying skills but might need a refresher course in seasoning. Great atmosphere; easy to see why they have such a strong following."}
{"text":"Took some friends here to Friday night fish fry. We used to come all the time , but moved out of town 1 year ago. So excited to get back and have the Lake perch fish fry-always my favorite! 
We were really disappointed, looked like and tasted like we actually got bluegill and very little lake perch. The breading was also not what we remembered. Bluegill was over fried and very fishing tasting.  Wish I was told they did have lake perch. 
Our waitress was awesome and really attentive. After dinner drinks at the bar didn't go so well. The 3 bartenders just I
ignored us until my husband hollered at them. Keep in mind they were not busy like o remember them being busy -too bad"}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  Came in to try the fish fry.  Crazy busy so we had high expectations!  3 ordered the fish fry, one a steak sandwich, - a big mistake.  Took forever to get seated, took even longer to get waited on.  The table was not completely cleared nor reset when we were seated.  Still, high expectations!
The fish came out, very dark as if fried in old oil and the steak sandwich-horrible.  It consisted of an extremely small tip of a steak, very fatty, served on two pieces of grocery store white bread, stacked, which acted as a sponge to soak up the bloody juices.  By the time I cut out the fat, there was precious little left to eat, other than the soggy fries.
The fish wasn't much better, definitely not what we had hoped for.
Maybe it was our bad luck but we are not planning on a revisit, there are so many better places around worth trying."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fish fry and are in madison, look no further than esquire. The coleslaw is the best in town. If you're looking to eat a lot, order the ocean perch. If you're trying to eat a light fish fry the lake perch is spectacular. Beer prices are good and it's got a great homey atmosphere"}
{"text":"In 2015, Kavanaugh's Esquire Club's Sunday Chicken Dinner was listed by WiSJ as one of the 30 plates that define Madison. One year later, there I was - craving fried chicken. Fast food just didn't seem good enough and the only solid fried chicken I've found in town wasn't serving it that night. A quick web search confirmed that chicken was on the menu at Esquire Club every night. So off I was!

I think this qualifies as a supper club though quite honestly as a transplant I don't really understand what that means. The restaurant wasn't busy though it was late on a weekend night. I'm glad it wasn't jam packed as some reviewers report for fish fry night.

The wait staff were fantastic. Warm and friendly service. The experience wasn't fancy but it was... comfortable, like visiting a friend's home.

The food was really good. Portions were generous. The chicken was crisp and flavorful with tender and moist meat. Paired with slaw, it was fantastic.

Can't wait to try the fish fry and steak."}
{"text":"I heard supper clubs in WI still hold a special place in the culinary scene so my boyfriend and I decided to come here for their Friday fish fry and some cheese curds. 

Decor: a bit dated or old fashioned but still inviting and cozy. We sat down at a table by the window which was nice. 

Food: my boyfriend had the bottomless fish fry and I had the baked cod. He said the fish fry was mediocre and the batter was a bit too thick for his liking. My baked cod was kind of bland but still very tender. There's generous amount of coleslaw, tartar sauce and sour cream on the table to accompany your food. The cheese curds were not the best we've had. Again too much batter and they were not squeaky. 

We weren't particularly impressed by the average food here. However, our sweet waitress delivered excellent service. It's unlikely that we'll eat here again since there're better options for fish fry close by."}
{"text":"Lunch or dinner you can't go wrong with the Esquire.  I have been going here for years and keep coming back.  The food is consistently good.  Love their steaks.  Really like their fish fry. The place has been owned by the Kavanaugh family since the 1940's.  John III (dad) and his family (John IV and Jackie) make you feel like you are part of their family.  Nice people.  Highly recommend.  A++."}
{"text":"Best cheeseburgers in the state of Wisconsin!  
A great place with excellent food and wonderful service- Feels like a Wisconsin supper club but better!"}
{"text":"I went there a few months ago for Fish Fry after reading a rating that this place was a great place for Fish Fry's. I've had dinner here before and it was very good, so I thought oh why not, I'll give it a try. Big mistake! They usually get pretty busy (usually a good sign), but that night we didn't have to wait long for a table. I ordered the Icelandic Cod and It was terrible. As this was a few months ago, my brain is clouded on which exact fish (cod or perch) the comments were made about, but as I recall: The waitress claimed that the cod isn't \"fresh\" and she knew I didn't like it, so she offered to get me some perch, which was fresh. That wasn't much better. One (either the cod or the perch) of them tasted, looked like and smelled like a \"fish stick.\" It literally looked like a kiddie meal. All in all, I will never return for a fish fry there. The waitress was very attentive and tried to make me happy, but it was not her fault, she did everything she could to please me. Service = 5 star, Atmosphere = 4 Star, Food (overall) = 4 Star, Fish Fry = 1 Star"}
{"text":"Love: Cheese curds that were definitely made in house, bread was good and fresh and made in house
Meh: Most of the meal was pretty meh. Coconut shrimp tasted good but had an odd texture, pretty much everything was just okay. Not nasty. Not over the top excited to go back; nope, just a-ok, doubt I'd want to spend much money here in the future.
Hate: Pop music was blaring over the speakers. WHYYYY? Do you not know your target audience???"}
{"text":"This is the closest 'upscale' restaurant near my house, and I really want to love it ... But I cannot. Like a bad old flame from my past, I keep going back and having regret. It costs too much, the service is great or horrible, the fish fry tastes old. I've been here 8 or more times, and had to struggle to give it 3 stars. It could be so much more with quality food and service."}
{"text":"Anyone bashing the E as the home of the Tea Party is seriously misguided.  This place is so eclectic you might find some card carrying communists at the bar from time-to- time.  Seriously, the large crowd of regulars and semi-regulars ranges from former and current Dems to the same on the Republican end.  Non-partisans, liberals, libertarians, agnostics, Catholics, retirees, got em' all at the Esquire.  John Sr. is a conservative but he welcomes everyone with genuine good cheer and gratitude for coming to his place.  More than 50 years in the Kavanaugh family - this place was LOCAL before local was trendy.  Shame on you purveyors of misinformation - no better than Scotty Koch, himself.

Excellent drinks at the bar from Joe, Nick and Ben (and Nate on Fridays).  Great pours of many wines by the glass.  Terrific fish fry and food.

btw - Saturday after the big 70k rally, many of us were warming up at the bar, having a drink or wine and some food and swapping \"war stories\" and photos from our day on the square protesting against the nit wit that was elected governor.  Tea Party my rear end."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Wednesday fish fry special. We had a group of 12 and we were served very quickly the service was excellent 
The fish is lightly battered and piping hot.Loved the warm the bread and the slaw was crisp and juicy the way I like it
the fries were crisp and the servers were on top of everything.Great evening for all.
   We will definitely be back and love that you can get the fish on Wednesdays ,as Fridays it is crazy busy."}
{"text":"Great place for a Friday night fish fry and a good brandy old fashion. Supper club feel...The fish fry dinner comes with some of the best coleslaw and fresh rye bread I've ever had. I also really enjoy their baked potatoes. 

Another favorite of mine is their chicken parm...yum yum...you get more than enough to eat with each meal, soup AND salad is included!

A MUST while visiting after dinner make sure to stop at the bar and get a grasshopper or another one of their amazing ice cream cocktails, some of the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I just had one of the best meals in my life.  Thursday nights are corned beef special eves. It was great. Like nothing else I've ever had. The staff is friendly the atmosphere comfy and the prices reasonable.  Go now."}
{"text":"Likes: The food was good (I got steak), the facilities were clean, and the prices were a little higher but good for what the food's value is. 

Dislikes: Despite being able to get a seat instantly, our waitress wasn't coming in a timely manner, the music was a little loud, and it was dark in there.

There are better places to go, but you can consider going here if nothing else."}
{"text":"As a Wisconsin native, Friday fish fries have always been a big part of my life. When living in Madison years ago, we used to hit all the great fish fries on the lakes around town. And while spending 10 years in Hayward, we used to live for Fridays at Lost Land Lake Lodge and later The Waterfront. Living in Utah for over 20 years, my opportunities are few and far between. So I was excited to have a free Friday in Madison to try the very best. Reading online reviews, going off my past knowledge and talking to friends, I made the tough call between the Avenue Bar (one of my favorite lunch spots) and the Esquire Club. We chose the Esquire.

I hadn't been in the club in probably 30-35 years. Overall, it was a good experience. But it wasn't close to the level to which I'm accustomed to in Hayward on our three or four trips out there a year. We had a great time and I highly recommend it, but we would make another choice next time.

The bar at Kavanaugh's Esquire Club is great - a full horseshoe with plenty of seating. We arrived around 5:30 p.m. on a Friday in Lent. It was packed already, as was every spot in the parking lot. We put our name in and were told it would be 20 minutes for our party of two. We were seated in just ten.

One of the challenges with the Esquire is it just doesn't have a lot of natural atmosphere. The main room with the bar is fabulous. But the other dining rooms are really plain with not a single thing on the wall. The table settings are nice. And outside, it's a totally blah building. Out the back door to the parking lot was an attractive collection of a few hundred cigarette butts sitting on the sidewalk and snowbank.

The tables are pre-set with great, fresh rye bread and fabulous cole slaw. And we had quick attention from our waitress. The host gave us menus - actually three stapled, photocopied sheets - pretty tacky (I noticed others did get regular menus). It's a full supper club menu with multiple choices for fish fry. We opted for the $9.95 all-you-can-eat ocean perch. What was notable to me as that the current Web page for Esquire lists the price at $8.95. Not good. Cod was also available at a slightly higher price.

The bread and slaw kept us entertained and both were world class. A heaping plate of fish and crinkle fries arrived in good time (beating the Coke our grandson ordered 15 minutes earlier). We had to ask for lemons.

The fish was very good - I love perch. But as good as it was, it simply wasn't at the presentation and taste level of what we traditionally get at The Waterfront in Hayward, for example. It was a simple cornbread-type breading that was good, but somewhat uninteresting - not the flamboyant texture of the beer battered fish we have grown to expect.

Nonetheless, we polished off the fish, got a few more fries and a chocolate mousse desert. The bill for two with a few beers and desert was just under $40.

Later that night, we also hit the Beachhouse in McFarland, another popular local spot. My wife had dinner there with a friend. This is an awesome place with a ton of atmosphere and great fish.

Esquire Club Summary (five point scale)
Exterior: 2 - Pretty plain building; cigarette butts not pretty
Interior atmosphere: 3 - Main bar room is great
Food: 4 - Good was great, not overally thrilled with fish batter
Service: 3 - Generally good, but shouldn't have to wait for main course to get a Coke
Value: 5 - $9.95 for an all-you-can-eat fish fry at this level is outstanding"}
{"text":"Great value, unassuming atmosphere, huge portions.  Got the New York strip (perfectly cooked and sourced locally), paid up for the chopped salad in lieu of the dinner salad (excellent).  Would never have entered into this place because of its appearance.  Not fancy, dark, out of date decor, paper napkins, etc.  But it is as good as any higher priced steak house. Recommend the mushrooms on the side of the steak.  Came with soup (which was just average but I'm not a fan of navy bean) and had plenty  of food leftover.  Our waitress (Emily) was a pro despite her young age.  Would return for sure for the great meal at an amazing price."}
{"text":"A group of 5 went last night and had a great meal. The service was excellent both at the bar and dining room. Our waitress helped steer the table away from a few dishes to make sure we hit the highlights. The food is not molecular science but it is good mid west meal. It brought me back to my childhood with the 4 courses; salad bar, cup of soup, starch and entree. Our table all had steaks or prime rib and each as cook properly and not over done. Also the large steins of beer were a great touch. We want to come back for a Friday fish fry."}
{"text":"Met a group of friends for dinner one night.  1. This place is a dump. Mismatched chairs, crappy nasty carpet, chipped up bar, dirty white walls and an ugly smelly bathroom. 2. The food was a joke. My cod was straight out the box. The menu should have said that it was made by the Gordon's fisherman. Tarter sauce had been sitting on the table for a while. Fries were under cooked and the fry oil desperately needs changing.  3. The service wasn't stellar at all, she was slow, she kept forgetting the same thing over and over again and she could not figure out how to split up the bill. It was a hot mess.  I wouldn't go back if you paid me."}
{"text":"Not a fan.  We had a breakfast buffet for a meeting there and the food was... not much of a buffet.  Potatoes were cold and greasy and the rest of the food was just not very good.  Have not had lunch or dinner here."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here on a Friday for the 3rd time.  I love their food!  We had drinks in the bar before being seated.  I like the fact that they have coleslaw and bread waiting on the table when you sit so in case you're starving, or think you are, you have something to eat.  I ordered the porterhouse which the waitress said was 16-18 ounces ($35) and it included soup, salad, and choice of potato.  One thing here, the website says $30.95.  I opted for the fully loaded hash browns...hey....it was Friday night....DON'T JUDGE!!  Anywayz, the salad came and it was ice cold with fancy carrot shavings and chunks of lettuce, etc. with a good sized cup of chunky blue cheese.  I loved it.  The steak was well caramelized and tasted great.  My girlfriend had the fish fry and our other guest had butterflied shrimp.  Everything tasted great.  
Why then for the 2 stars?  We had reservations for 7:00.  At 7 they said they were running 40 minutes behind.  At 8:00 they said we were next.  Four groups later at 8:20 they called our name.  I received my entree at 9:15.  I don't know what happened, they were busy as usual for a Friday night but I'm not sure I'll ever eat there again.  If you are willing to pay $30 to $40 for a plate there are a lot of restaurants in town who will get you in your seat properly."}
{"text":"The Esquire knows how to take care of their customers.  We have received excellent service and if there was a problem, it was swiftly taken care of.

They have the best fish fry in town and a variety of other items for those oddballs that don't like a good fish fry.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The name is actually Kavanaughs Esquire Club and when we arrived for our 6 pm reservation the bar section was packed and rocking. As the night wore on it became more and more apparent that this was a highly unusual experience.  Once we were all assembled we were seated in what appeared to be the \"new section\" a bright room with stained ceiling tiles and large leather chairs with windows overlooking the small parking lot.

Where or where to start? It's as if it was the first day of work every employee on this busy Saturday night on Graduation Weekend for University of Wisconsin; Everything seemed a jumble and mistake after mistake were piling up across the restaurant.

It started with our server,perhaps it was her first day as she could only carry two glasses of water at at time so it took quite a while for our party of 7 to just get water.  Next the menus, because it was busy (clearly a novelty for this place) they could only find 3 for our table and they weren't even all the same-most had three pages but 1 only had 2 omitting all the steaks.  Next our waitress whom I'm sure was the town librarian as she spoke barely above a whisper, came for our drink order.  I had spotted a bottle of Caymus in their wine cabinet while we were waiting so asked for that.  At least 15 minutes later I flagged down the manager to ask about the wine as our server had vanished and then the bartender jumped into the fray to track down the wine which she brought out -already opened-and splashed it around filling the glasses to the top.  Clearly they don't sell much fine wine here.

I could go on and on but just to give you a flavor...
-took over an hour for the food to arrive which was of only average to below average quality and barely warm
-table next to ours, older couple who were clearly regulars, shrimp cocktail appetizer finally arrived 10 minutes AFTER they finished main course
-hostess sat a group of 14 at a table with only 10 chairs and as the rest of group arrived they had to commandeer another large table
-at least 2 other nearby tables had incorrect meals with the young bartender jumping in again to try and smooth over mistakes

All in all LOTS of unhappy customers who will likely spread the word about their experience.  

In the end it just became more and more comical with the hostess jumping in as a server along with the bartender and everyone running around in full panic mode.  I'm sure this is not the experience they were hoping to provide and our celebration ended up being quite memorable-just not in a way one would expect.

NOT RECOMMENDED!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst meal ever!!! Over an hour wait for cold food. It was st. Pats day. All corned beef and kids burgers and one rare steak, and we had to ask about the food and it was ice cold. Take in mind we got there at 4:15pm."}
{"text":"The name may be a bit strange, but there's nothing strange about the food - it's excellent! It's a rather understated place and the interior is a bar combined with a dining area, but not noisy, at least on a weekday night. I had the cheese curds (oh the delight) and the Perch fish fry was pretty good as well - highly recommended if you're visiting Madison and want to sample the local flavors :)."}
{"text":"Kavanaugh's Esquire, what a strange name. This was the latest stop on the Friday night fish fry circuit. I had the ocean perch \"family style\" which means all-you-can-eat, in case that didn't make much sense to you (like it didn't to me). It's actually the cheapest option too, which is fantastic for a big eater like me. It's breaded with cornmeal, nothing particularly special I would say. It didn't have any distinct flavor to it. One of my companions who had the lake perch said that was distinctly different than the ocean perch, though I didn't try it so I can't compare. The fries are unsalted and soft. I like well-seasoned and nicely crisp fries so that was definitely a minus for me, although another companion apparently likes limp fries with crisp ends...go figure. Coleslaw is plentiful and was overflowing with whatever sauce goes into it (I don't eat slaw).

Overall, it's not particularly noteworthy food but $14 all you can eat fry is a solid deal and it's a nice supper clubby place, and we had a great waitress."}
{"text":"It's like Denny's built a food court at a retirement home.  If fish fry and old fashions is your thing and you want to hang out with grandma and grandpa while you eat your food, this is the place.  The upper crust in Maple Bluff love this place.  The only thing I can chalk it up to is they can get wasted and not drive that far to get home.  Wood paneling decor round out this gem."}
{"text":"The Esquire Club is just what the 3-star rating allows, A-OK.  After being here a number of times, this was the first time in which our reservation was sat on time (in fact, a little early).  Our entire party, 4 adults and 2 toddlers, did notice that it was a slow night.  Perhaps that was the reason for the prompt seating, but I will not jump to those conclusions.  

From our table we were presented with both a myriad of Brett Farve autographed photos and peeling wall paper.  I feel like one of the photos should be sold to shore up the rest of the decor.  Aside from this, the rest of the atmosphere matched what I would hope for during a \"family style\" fish Friday.  

Everyone in the party opted for the lake perch.  The fish alone comes away with a 3/5.  The slaw gets bonus points for being nice and soupy, but that is a personal preferance. Good bread and good attention towards the little ones.  The service has always been friendly, but at times slower than expected.  

All-in-all I am torn with Kavanaugh's.  It is a step above the \"Meh\" experience, and so we walk away with a 3."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service, went here for breakfast and was in shock and awe at how bad our server was.  It took well over 45 minutes for us to get our food and there was only 1 other table in the restaurant.  I got our own coffee, drinks, half and half, ketchup and jam.  I will NEVER go back there again!"}
{"text":"Friday = Great Fish Fry.  All you can eat ocean perch.  Big bowls of slaw, tartar sauce, and lemon chunks on the table.  Dignified and refined, I wouldn't eat perch anywhere else in Madison."}
{"text":"Went for the Friday fish fry with my family and parents, and we all ordered the fried perch, which is served family style. Good hot fried fish, and fries were ok. Soupy-like coleslaw. Definitely your old style supper club type atmosphere and food. It made my parents happy, which is all that mattered really."}
{"text":"Another great super club that is a must while in town!  Great Friday night fish fry! Ocean perch family style all you can eat, yummy! Great old fashions too. They have their own parking lot right behind the building"}
