{"text":"Everything was fantastic. We had the chips and dip, lamb chops, pan roasted chicken, the New Orleans bread pudding, and the triple chocolate cake. Our server was very nice and he made us feel right at home. The staff was very friendly. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Went here after wedding dress shopping and found Don's Pomeroy House to be a lovely and intimate place to have a meal. Well decorated, this restaurant sets a wonderful mood for the diners.

As this was during the lunch hours, we were immediately seated downstairs.

Service was a bit slow, especially for it being lunch and a later lunch (around 2pm). Our waiter was nice enough.

Lunch menu is nice but has no steak (my mom wanted a small one but none were available!) I ordered a salad, which was delicious and the rest ordered burgers or a salad as well. Quality of the food was quite good and we were all pleased with the meals."}
{"text":"Special nite out, service was top notch, Steak Bernaise was so yummy, nice wine selection. Glad we went."}
{"text":"This is probably my most favorite place to eat in the area. We were there for Christmas Eve once again this year. Very upscale, nice atmosphere, very attentive wait staff, and great food. This last time I ordered the Fish Market salad and the Blue Fillet (which came with green beans and whipped potatoes). I believe the total was about 34-36 plus beverages. Yes, it was well worth the money. The salad is a great combination of greens, egg, baby shrimps, and dressing. They also offer a bread basket for each table when the salad is served. The Fillet was tender, tasty, and done to perfection. I cant wait to go back soon."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had dinner here a couple of nights ago. It was our first time there and we enjoyed ourselves. The food was great, seasoned and cooked to our liking. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. We actually finished our meals and ordered desserts, which we rarely do. The desserts we good too. We will be back."}
{"text":"First let me say that at this restaurant, you get what you pay for. Portions are fair and the food is excellent quality. I had the short-rib which had the perfect amount of tenderness, but still holds together. It is seasoned perfectly (not too light but not heavy at all)  The rest of the table was very satisfied as well. This is some of the best service I've ever seen. Very friendly and attentive. (We had Christina) we also sat in the pub which is very cozy, and comfortable.  I strongly recommend Dons for Any special occasion."}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite local place to dine.  We've been here a bunch of times and always leave happy and full! They have a little pub area in the downstairs that kind of gives the feel of a speak easy.  Which is just awesome. The upstairs part is a bit more upscale but still casual and comfortable.  We finally ate on the patio for the first time this summer. Wow!!! It was our best experience there so far! It's beautiful and just not what you would expect. You cannot see in the patio area from outside so when you see it for the first time, it's just stunning! We will forever love this place and definitely will keep bringing loved ones here."}
{"text":"Went to the Pub at Dons Pomeroy House and had the most wonderful meal. Everyone had something different and everyone thoroughly enjoyed themselves.  On my next trip to Cleveland we will definitly be going back for dinner again.  Service was outstanding!!"}
{"text":"I think that this is the greatest local place around. I have been going here for years and we always sit in the PUB the ladies down there are the greatest. We love our waitress Jannette.

Thanks
Nick and Dave"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, great service.

I've never had a bad meal at Don's Pomeroy.  Their menu has a great range of items, which is great for when I go to dinner with picky eaters or people with dietary restrictions.  It is a little bit pricy, but the quality is well worth it."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner recently at Don's Pomeroy House. We both had the Champagne Surf 'n Turf. He had a Pomeroy House salad as well, and I had the Fish Market salad. It was our anniversary, and our server, Jeri, took very good care of us. She even brought us a chocolate éclair to share for dessert.  Yes, it is expensive, but it is a definite must for special occasions. The service and the food are always top notch."}
{"text":"Outstanding atmosphere and service. Our server...wish I remembered his name,gave us just the right amount of service without being over bearing.We ordered the special that evening and it was out of this world! The roasted brussel sprouts were the best I've ever tasted. I ordered the wedge salad but it was made with roasted romaine...oh my gosh delish!We sat in the lovely library room . I really felt pampered by the end of the evening. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant in Ohio.  My roommate used to work there and I got to go all the time and sit on the patio and eat fabulous food off of the upstairs menu.  The soups are fabulous, especially the lobster bisque.  The scallops with asparagus risotto is by far my favorite.  If you are in the Cleveland area, you have to visit this restaurant!  It is FABULOUS!"}
{"text":"Your St. Patrick's Day corn beef dinner was superb!!  Nice sized portion........everything tasted great!!

{"text":"Great Food.  Great History.  Don's Pomeroy House dates back to the 1800's and was even a  stop on the Underground Railroad.  It went through different owners and was even left vacant and unattended to in the 1960s.  The city of Strongsville, however, banded together to restore the homestead.  It was entered on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

I've now been to Don's Pomeroy House twice.  Both times we ate in The Pub (downstairs) and both times was for lunch.  The upstairs is called The Restaurant and there is also a patio.  The Pub has a great ambiance, dimly lit, cozy and comfortable.

I had the Turkey Panini one time and the half sandman sandwich and soup the other.  Everything was excellent.  Well seasoned fries, tasty and healthy salad, good soup.  The sandman sandwich was on thinly sliced bread which was perfect since it's paired with soup or salad.  The Turkey Panini had more bread to it but was just as good.  I asked for the fries on the side but they usually come as part of the sandwich.  For what you're getting, I'd say the prices are very reasonable for lunch.  The service has also always been excellent.

I'm anxious to go back and take the time to check out the old charm and try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"It is definitely pricey but worth it. We have had seafood and steaks. Every meal was excellent.  Great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and both times were absolutely perfect. On our first visit the waiter recommended a craft beer which ended up being a new favorite that I now regularly purchase. We struck up a short conversation with our waiter discussing how we had recently moved to the area. As a result, he bought us a delicious dessert which made us feel so welcomed and grateful. They took us on a tour and explained the history of the fabulous historic building. On our second trip here, my fiancé proposed! The staff was amazing. They provided us with a private dining room at no additional cost and made sure our night was absolutely perfect. 

After we finished dinner, we went into the pub in the basement which was so charming. The atmosphere is so desirable and I love that we have a place like this in Strongsville!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! We came late on Tuesday night unexpectedly. It was live music there. The upstairs dining room was closed by then and we were sited in the pub. Everything was great. The waitress was a pleasure so as everything else. Only one regret that I live on the other side of town and can not come to this place more often."}
{"text":"Go to Don's on a nice day and you will find yourself enthralled with their outdoor patio.  The nicest outdoor atmosphere combined with upscale cuisine in the area.  I always enjoy dining here.  They have a nice wine selection and their food is excellent in terms of design and execution.  Their fish entrees are normally extra special."}
{"text":"I received a very good service from Tammy.  The place was built in mid 1800's.  In fact, Don's Pomerroy House is a registered landmark of Ohio which has a rich 200+ years history of statehood.  It harkens back to those glory days of industry spurred on by Erie Canal.  The name sounds almost Italian but the menu was really \"American\" with southwestern cuisine and all the usual classic dish. Comfortable ambiance.  Reasonably priced.  All in all, I would recommend highly without any reservation.  It's the best place to stop by in Strongsville, Ohio bar none."}
{"text":"Very disappointing to say the least. I had a business dinner where me and my associate ordered the Cowboy Ribeye. For $48, you expect a thick cut which is mouth watering. Both steaks were rubbery on the outside and not very juicy.  I also had the seafood chowder which was ok. We sat in the pub which was a nice atmosphere.  I had not been here in a couple years and may not return considering there are many great steak houses to choose from with better pricing."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Patio seating ... We really enjoyed it! The food was spectacular . I had the salmon with rice,asparagus ,and blueberries it was delicious! My wife had the braised short rib.. It was sooo good!! I always get a good meal at Don's!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is better than most, but for a $90 meal (2 entrees and two glasses of wine), I would have expected more.   I had four well prepared sauteed scallops.   They were served with lobster mashed potatoes with a garnish of sprouts.  The mashed potatoes were \"pasty\".  I cannot believe that they were freshly prepared mashed potatoes.  There was no vegetable.  My wife had the pretzel covered walleye with roasted sweet potatoes.  She got a vegetable, which was ill prepared brussel sprouts.   The sprouts should have been par boiled before they were roasted.   

Despite the nice service and ambiance, I didn't think the value of the meal approached"}
{"text":"I am so glad I was able to experience the great patio on this place before it got too cold! My friend and I went here last October, and we lucked out with a warm fall night. We were able to sit outside on their patio, which was just so amazing. (You would never know you were so close to a main road.) Our server was so friendly and on top of things, and when we were in a time crunch at the end of the night, they were so accommodating (we really appreciated it). I loved how you could choose from the bar menu or the restaurant menu on the patio - it was super nice and gave such a wide variety of food to choose from."}
{"text":"disappointed
spent 300.00 bucks for a grand evening.
hour and half to get food.waitress says there's a party in banquet room !!! filled up on wine and bread..
next time don\"t accept reservations if your short staff."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal with friends on the Patio last night. Service and food were great. Plan on returning soon."}
{"text":"Don's Pomeroy House  is one of my mine and my wife's go-to restaurants.  By default it is the closest \"higher-end\" restaurant to our home and typically does not disappoint.  The food is good but would expect excellent for every meal at the price-point.  I feel it is like russian roulette if I am going to love my meal or just like it based on my own tasting preference.  The service is good but it has a feeling that you are crammed into the restaurant and you may bump elbows at times with other patrons.  The atmosphere is unique and reminds me of grandma and grandpas library."}
{"text":"We had a dinner here for a special occasion. The house is very nice. A cozy atmosphere with the wood, the bookshelves with books and the fireplace. 

The food. We had a steak and a pork chop. And some salads. The grilled Romain salad. Best part of the meal. The bread was good before the meal. The steak we had was good. The pork chop was NOT very good. The apple and cranberry chutney was not good. I've had way better pork chops recently at BJ's and other less expensive restaurants. 

The server was okay. She wasn't the most personable but adequate. She never said 'you're welcome' to any of our 'thank you's'. I know it has to suck saying you're welcome so many times as a server....but not even once. Weirdness. 

Overall this place did not impress enough to say it was anymore than just okay. Especially for the prices being in the higher range. I expected more. We may try it one more time to see if it is any better because the atmosphere is so cozy in there. The Pub looked cool. May try that too."}
{"text":"Yes, it is expensive...but you will most definitely be served a quality meal.

I've been here several times over the past few years, trying all the dining spaces:
- Main dining rooms
- Downstairs bar
- Outdoor patio

Each has its own nuances and charms, given the reason or occasion chosen.  Looking for a more formal meal?  Of course the main dining spaces are lovely and full of charm.  Want a casual drink with friends or a nice pub grub type meal?  Head downstairs to a wood wall-to-wall space that screams comfort and European pub styling.  Looking for a nice (but more casual) special occasion get-together, give the outdoor patio a try.

They always seem to have a nice selection of sandwiches, salads and soups during lunchtime and the dinner menu is more traditional seafood, beef and chicken type fare.  Give it a try, don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Probably the oldest building in Strongsville so there's lotsa of history in this place.  Great patio in the summer.  I think it's hyperbole to say this is the best in Ohio but you'll definitely get well prepared cuisine, in particular the fish (tilipia and sea bass).   I would not drive from downtown Cleveland to eat here but if you're in Strongsville / Middleburg Hts area this is a top option."}
{"text":"I wanted to go here for my birthday for the longest time. My boyfriend made reservations for my birthday this year and we had to change the time a little which they were very nice about. We ended up sitting out on the patio because I always thought it looked beautiful, which it was. Our waitress was very  very nice and did a great job. We got the ahi tuna for an appetizer..it was out of this world and even the wasabi was the best I've ever had..very smooth. I ordered the Faroe Island Salmon which was delicious but the rice and asparagus on the side didn't have too much flavor. My boyfriend ordered the Texas sirloin which he said was gristly/fatty and we try not to be picky but for the price it should be a little better than that. He loved his baked potato though! Our waitress brought out a giant eclair for my birthday which was different but super good. Great service, I'd go back."}
{"text":"I have been to Don's a few times and have always enjoyed the stuffed mushroom and the Tilapia, usually we dine downstairs in the pub which has a great atmosphere and the is food absolutely fantastic. So why only three stars? My family took me there recently for my birthday and we dined upstairs, I was not allowed the Tilapia because that is only for the Pub's diners and as far as the mushrooms, I have made better myself. They were not the same recipe that we had enjoyed many times before. 
Very disappointed in the food and the begging we had to do to get the Tilapia served upstairs.
Now let me also explain my family and I have been in the service business for many years, managing and as work staff and all the places we have worked it is never ever okay to deny a customer something so simple as bringing food upstairs.  But it is mainly the horrible experience with the tasteless mushrooms and the begging we had to do that we will not be going back anytime soon.
A Very Disappointed Customer"}
{"text":"Very interesting restaurant, a lot of history with this house.
The service was very good and the food was OK , I felt my Grouper was a little over cooked but the balance of the meal and the person I was entertaining seemed to like her choices.
Definitely would try again when I am in town"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my parents, sister and her boyfriend and my girlfriend. We had dinner and I thought it was a great fine dinning experience. Our table was ready at arrival, service was a little above average. The food was great, we started with calamari and Ahi tuna as appetizers. The ahi tuna was a small serving size but other than that both appetizers were great. I had a 6oz filet with a lobster tail mashed potatoes and greens beans. It was on special for 29.00 instead of the usual 39.00. The prices are fairly high. We went to celebrate my birthday and my sisters bf birthday and they took a Polaroid picture of the couples and but it in a card with a birthday wish, which was a nice surprise. I would go back only for special occasions tho."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a dinner on the Patio Friday night. Hard to believe that you can sit so close to 42/82 the busiest intersection in the area, and hardly notice traffic.  The patio is a great place for a semi casual dinner at Pomeroy. Started with a drink at The Pub downstairs. The Pub is decent for a drink, but frankly ready for an update. The food on the Patio was good; I had the Ahi Tuna starter, which was decent, and The Salmon special, which was really good. My wife had Fish and Chips, which was also really good. It has been a while since we had been at Pomeroy and we will likely return."}
{"text":"After dining at Don's for years we finally decided to try the patio for dinner on a Saturday and WOW! What a beautiful place! It was much bigger than I imagined and practically all the tables were shaded by trees in a natural parklike setting. I never understood the attraction of eating outdoors a few feet from a street with buses, trucks and cars driving by like at some other restaurants. Our waitress was training a new waiter and they were both very friendly and accommodating. They typically only serve bottled beer on the patio since it is a lengthy walk to the pub area for draught beer but our wait staff was more than willing to bring us some refreshing draught beers from the pub. We ordered calamari and a crab cake as appetizers and they both were perfectly prepared and delicious! My wife ordered the spinach salad with salmon from the pub menu and I ordered the C.A.B. filet from the specials of the day menu. The salmon was done perfectly and tasty and the salad which contained almonds, dried cranberries and feta cheese was pleasing as well. My filet was extremely tender and done perfectly as ordered, but as described, it came with a mild semi sweet chili sauce that I felt didn't quite complement the meal. For dessert we split the chocolate mousse which was of course scrumptious. Service was great, food was really good and the patio was absolutely beautiful ! Must try !!"}
{"text":"I decided to try Don's out for a Valentine dinner with my girlfriend as per her review on google she was disappointed. We started with our drinks which we got quickly but waited no less than 40 minutes to order, the waitress excuse was \"she had dessert orders that was backed up\" so your telling me you can't 3 minutes to take our order. After we got our food my girlfriends scallops were way overcooked she didn't even finish them. As for my dish lamb rack it was cooked the way I asked the risotto was abit overcooked but edible meal in whole was mediocre. For the 131.00 price tag should of been around 80.00 at best and I choked hard even giving the tip I did which wa 15% I normally give 20 Or more %."}
{"text":"It had been too long since we had been to Strongsvilles finest restaraunt. 
We met with old friends and were warmly greeted on the only cold night in Ohio this winter.
My Ohio pork chop was done perfectly its always my favorite here. My wife's Walleye ( She had to have it cause you can't get Walleye in Florida) was terrific. 
Out waitress was jovial and played along with my friend's bad jokes.
A great evening"}
{"text":"A Strongsville tradition: cozy pub, Underground Railroad history and upscale dining good for life's celebrations.  

We were so impressed that a hostess went out of her way to give our out-of-town guests an impromptu tour of the house's history including letting the kids hide in the cellar as runaway slaves would have 150+ years ago. It was a powerful and eerie lesson.  The kids were revived with braised short ribs and carrot cake on the patio."}
{"text":"This was seriously one of the best meals I've had in a loooonggg time!
I was thoroughly impressed.  The atmosphere is sophisticated and romantic.  I love the bookshelves and the tables they place in between them for privacy.  
The service was very professional and there was always someone there when you needed a refill or your plate cleared.  They also gave me a gigantic elcaire since it was my birthday and a photograph which was a little strange, but very nice.  
I ordered the surf and turf.  Both were done perfectly.  We also had the voodoo shrimp for an appetizer.  YOu would think bacon wrapped anything would be delicious in itself, but add some curry and you have perfection.  
Although this meal put a bit of a dent in the wallet, I believe it was well worth it.  I'll be visiting Don's again in the near future.  
I also would suggest reservations."}
{"text":"We ate on the tree covered patio which was cool in 2 ways :)  felt so relaxed not a care in the world. I had the filet that came with potatoes and green beans and boy it hit the spot. Also for desert had a Baileys cheesecake with Oreo crust that was yummy too. This place was a good time. However, I am curious as to why they do not have a cocktail menu...hello Pomeroy house lets get that together and train the bartenders on some fancy drinks. With that being said I ordered a flirtini and my sister a cosmo, they were a bit off, drinkable but still off. Our waiter was a younger super sweet kid, bravo to you running around doing some work. He even took the candle from his parents table that happen to be dining there too just so we could have some ambiance."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with my wife some months back, and I had quite an experience (read on). 

The building is nice (historical) with a unique ambiance. The staff seems nice overall and I was seated immediately. Upon being seated I mentioned to the server that I have an intolerance to citric acid so no lemon, lime, orange or tomato. I had mentioned this to him multiple times during the service. The wine selection was pretty good and the food was good as well. The reason for the three stars is the fact that my main course was inedible because they put the scallops I ordered in a tomato based lobster bisque. I was told when it came that it did not contain tomato, but to my painful surprise it most certainly did. So while I sat there in pain they debated calling an ambulance and I decided to wait it out. I left there with no discount on my check and no apology for the mistake from my server. 

Even though my first experience was so bad, I am still interested in trying this place again since the food was pretty good up until the point where I got sick."}
{"text":"Dons Pomeroy is such a freakin joke. We just tried to order to go (it's 5 on a Tuesday by the way...not a Friday) and talked to a lady in the pub. We were ready with our order from their online menu, tried placing it and the lady said they no longer had some things we wanted to order. She then put us on hold and came back a few minutes later to tell us they could not take care of us because we were unprepared. We hung up and called a manager and he then proceeded to tell us we are not a priority and that all they cared about was their guests that were there. This place sucks in a city that thinks their you know what doesn't stink. What a joke."}
{"text":"The menu has such a diverse selection of food and everything I have tried was so delicious and wonderfully prepared. The service was excellent, and the atmosphere is unique and lovely."}
{"text":"I like the Pomeroy House.  I've been a few times.  The first was last summer to sit on the patio with my beau.  We enjoyed our food and a bottle of wine in the romantical outdoors.
This time the beau and I were in the \"Pub\" downstairs for a small bite and a couple of drinks.  I'm not thrilled with the beer selection, but I'm a beer snob.  I settled with my Stella.  The this time (I got the fish tacos) was mediocre and to steal my beau's word...uninspired.  The portion size was great, but the quality of the food was lame.  There wasn't a fresh anything on it.  The Caprese Salad was delish however.
I'd recommend this place for a nicer night out on the patio, or for something more casual the downstairs is dark and cozy.
I'll go back again for sure."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant but pricey.  The pub is more reasonable.  Save for a special occasion.  Food very nice and staff friendly.

I remember in junior high our class took a trip to see the Antebellum mansion when it was being restored."}
{"text":"Most horrible EXPERIENCE in my lifetime of going to restaurants. Even half a star would be flattering them.Bad food ,even worse service, mean people including the manager and the servers. Would never recommend this place to even the people I hate. Guys there are better places for the money you are prepared to spend. Never again.
Thx
DR MD


Redemption: Square 22 across the street was a\" Total Class \" experience which saved our evening."}
{"text":"We had a lost reservation last Saturday. When we arrived, the staff did everything they could to accommodate us. We were seated quickly and proceeded to have a wonderful dinner. The French onion soup is delicious;mellow onions with homemade bread and just the right amount of savory melted cheese on top. The Chilean sea bass was light, flaky and buttery. Peanut butter pie for dessert was decadent. Overall a wonderful dinner with great service in a beautiful building. We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for any occasion; whether it be a lunch with coworkers or a fancy dinner for you and a date. My favorite thing about the menu here is the selection. From the sea to the land, it's all great here. The downstairs pub has a less expensive menu but still has fantastic options when compared to your typical pub, but you can always ask to order from the upstairs menu if you prefer.  The outdoor patio is beautiful, and in the summer there is no place in the area you would rather be. This is probably the most complete restaurant in the Strongsville area. The bang for your buck is unbeatable."}
{"text":"Fan-freaking-tastic!  Server, Ken: top notch in every regard.  Specials explained carefully.  The chip and dip appetizer (I think it was a lobster, crab, cheese w/white wine sauce but am not sure) served with buttery, grilled or toasted pita triangles was spectacular.  Seriously, it was a huge portion for two and although three of us shared it, we had way more than we could finish--not that I could not have done so but was saving room for my meal.  The strip steak I ordered was perfectly prepared and was extra flavorful and much more tender than a strip usually is.  Again, spectacular.  Sourdough bread served with meal was warm and crusty on the outside, buttery soft on the inside.  Steak was served with buttery mashed potatoes and fresh, properly cooked green beans.  Steak had some special mushrooms (forgot what kind) on it that were exceptionally yummy.  If you crave succulent, flavorful steak and a great dining experience I don't know where you will find anything similar other than at The Cabin Club in Westlake."}
{"text":"Had dinner  with my family for my birthday yesterday and  I couldn't have been any happier with the food and service we received.  We were given a private room which made the experience even more delightful. From appetizers to dessert I could not be happier. Great job!"}
{"text":"Don's is exactly what you would expect of a long-time steak house. Dark woods, low lighting, good service, and consistently great food.  But when you've been cooking up the same dishes for years and years, you would expect to get it perfected.  My only complaint is that the menu and the wine list is like something out of the eighties.  The wine selections are especially dated. I will certainly be back again, but would love to see just a little more 'now' in the offerings."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about half a dozen times over the past decade when visiting on business, and have to say that it's definitely one of the better restaurants in the Cleveland area.  Can you believe the prix fixe three-course dinner offering at less than $30!!!  Anyway, I've never had a bad meal here --- although my visits have always been for dinner --- and I've had some really excellent food served to me.  The wait staff is outstanding, and super helpful ... and they serve a fabulous martini !!!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest, this is one of those reviews more for me than for you.  That said, let's take a trip back in time - several years to two young college students looking for a special place for a birthday/anniversary meal.

We arrived and were seated quickly.  The meal was (as I recall) very good, although rich and large servings.  We were given a special treat at the end of the meal, although it was tastefully done.

We thought this was a classy place to go if you are in the area and looking for somewhere to celebrate a special occasion."}
{"text":"Dined in the downstairs pub area during a recent visit. Both the dining room and pub menus are available, so there is lots of variety. The bartenders are great and the drinks thoughtfully mixed. Great atmosphere - the type of place where you would feel equally comfortable taking a business associate for dinner or a date for a pre-dinner drink. Some have suggested that the prices are a little high. Yes, they are \"city\" prices. However, what I will say is that the ingredients and food preparation are top notch, so it's clear this establishment invests in in quality. (Even the cheese plate blew me away. I'm still not sure how they got such tasty strawberries in the middle of winter.) I live too far away to be a regular, but I will certainly stop in on my next trip and enthusiastically recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and great atmosphere  the clambake is outstanding . Best patio around"}
{"text":"I have to disagree with what the previous reviews said, although it hasn't been reviewed in almost a year and a half.

Don's Pomeroy House was a stop between Chicago and Philadelphia for us. We were looking for a good non-chain restaurant, and saw this on Yelp. It is a large place, with a pub in the downstairs, and a more upscale restaurant upstairs. Being that we wanted to be in and out relatively quickly, and were wearing jeans and sneakers, we went to the pub.

The service was okay, but the food was absolutely horrible. I had the 'best' of the bunch, with three sliders. They weren't bad, but one reason was they came out medium to medium-rare, just how I like them, although I never specified, so they should have come out medium-well. The toppings did not look appetizing, including the iceberg lettuce that really should have been romaine, and the tomatoes that were some of the palest I have ever seen

My mother got a calamari dish that not only had no flavor whatsoever, but the calamari were overcooked and the dish was topped with a plethora of Kraft Parmesan cheese, which not only looked cheap, it ruined the dish.

My sister had bacon-wrapped shrimp in a curry sauce, which seemed interesting when she ordered it. It was even more interesting when she received it, and not in a good way. The shrimp were deep-fried rather than grilled, and the curry sauce had a very subtle curry flavor that could barely be distinguished by the overpowering oil and sugar taste in the rest of it. I love curry, I love bacon, and I love shrimp, and I couldn't have more than a bite of the dish.

All in all, I would not go back. I would rather go to Olive Garden before going here, and I hate Olive Garden."}
{"text":"We had a staff holiday party here. This restaurant and former home is beautiful and full of history, decorated for Christmas it is lovely and picturesque. Unfortunately our experience didn't live up to the place.

There were 23 of us. They put us up in the VIP rooms upstairs, which was nice, but we all didn't fit in one room so we were separated into two rooms, which was unfortunate. We were willing to all squeeze at the two large tables, that sat 10 each, but our waiter wouldn't let us do it. Said it would be too hard for him to serve. Maybe so. 

We had a fixed group menu to choose from that our HR dept chose, which was still nice - steak, chicken, salmon, scallops or a veggie option. In our little room, which used to be the nursery, we chose steak, chicken and scallops. Now the bummer part for me, that choose chicken was, the sides listed on our menu are not what we received. We were supposed to get mashed potatoes and green beans. We got spinach and four thick sweet potato fries. The chicken was ok, but it wasn't anything that made my mouth water. Two ordered the steak. One guy ordered it rare and his was fine but the girl who ordered it medium received it too charred and cooked nearly through. She ate it because she didn't want to cause problems. The two at our table that ordered scallops said they were good but full of sand, so very gritty. I don't eat seafood but that doesn't sound tasty. To be fair those who did get the mashed potatoes said it was good.

We had three dedicated waitstaff, who were friendly but our service wasn't the best I've ever had. Granted we were there on a busy evening and we were a large group. But for the same atmosphere and I\"m sure price I'd go to Spread Eagle Tavern in Hanoverton. Food and service are better.

Having read the reviews for lunch and the pub, maybe that is the better way to go. I don't feel the need to go back and dine in the main rooms."}
{"text":"Today I had  the most delicious salmon dinner. Awesome with spinach pumpkin seeds with a touch of the most tasty tomato sauce.  I can't wait to go back. This restaurant never fails to have quality food. Also my salmon was sooooo fresh. Great place. Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Always delicious! Service is usually great as well. The atmosphere in the pub is very laid back while the dining room is romantic, best of both worlds!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed New Years dinner with friends there and everything was delicious.  Love the atmosphere and the kitchen worked around some dietary restrictions. Friendly and helpful staff.  Made for a great night!"}
{"text":"No reservations for the patio. Show up 20-30 min early. Food was outstanding I got the surf and turf and it was great along with a long island. They do not have a drink menu but have a wine listing. They can make just about anything you ask for drink wise but watch out they are strong"}
{"text":"Went here for a business dinner.  The building was so decrepit that I spent the evening worrying that I would fall through the floor.  One glass of wine that was never refilled. They brought out 2 wooden trays of appetizers for 12 people, each had about 5 pieces of thinly sliced something on it.  Ordered the Bouillabaisse as my entrée, came out room temperature or cooler, NO SOUP SPOON!"}
{"text":"Lunch Review:

I came here for lunch with a large group and thought a review was in order. I wanted to start by saying this is lunch review as I feel that Don's dinner and lunch are two different ball games. While I think Don's is great, it isn't worth the price you pay to be honest. The lunch scene is a little different though. 

I had a turkey rueben as this is a lunch fav of mine. It was great. Big rich pieces of turkey and all the traditional Rueben flavor to boot. It was reasonably priced and I felt a good value for the quality actually. I was very impressed and the service was good as usual.

Don's atmosphere is always cool and its old time feel is refreshing. When you are always surrounded by ultra trendy and modern, it is nice to slow down a bit. Overall, I was very impressed and much more likely to come back to here for lunch as opposed to dinner."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times. I have ate at the Pub in the basement, the dinning room on the main floor and also outside on the patio. This last time we ate outside on the patio. This place was supper busy outside but it was a Saturday. The restaurant opened up at 5pm and we were there at 5:45pm and we had to wait 40 minutes for a table. We did not mind as we went to the bar at the Pub to have a drink to pass time. If you come around 7 to sit outside you would get seated right away as the rush died down. The service was great, the food was great. I had a pork chop and it was a decent size. I have never been disappointed here in what I ordered."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday dinner with the wife.
- we were promptly seated, and greeted
- it is such a cool building, even a stop on the Underground Railroad
- my steak was cooked very well, and the sides were awesome
-and they had a few choices for my wife the vegan
-honestly, the vegan ravioli was better than my steak Oscar ( and my streak was very good) 

It was nice finding a place that my wife and I can go together, and she can stick to vegan; and I can get a steak."}
{"text":"Remember my parents going here for their 20th anniversary and my mom being so excited, then so happy with the experience. So I went into our meal on 9.30.2017 with a very positive mindset, excited to celebrate our 17th anniversary.

Background: Husband and I live in Lakewood and are both in our mid-40s, yet probably look younger. Regularly eat out in Cleveland and Lakewood. Have been to Don's Lighthouse several times and liked it. Usually go to Red steakhouse for our anniversary dinner, thought we would try something different this time around.

The good:
Pleasant greeting and they wished us a happy anniversary at the host stand. Seated immediately at a cozy booth in a beautiful old dining room. The two glasses of wine I ordered were good. Water glasses were refilled regularly.

The bad:
In a word - our server. Came over and introduced himself, got our drinks. Then asked if we wanted appetizers. When we said no, he just stood there. No question of are you ready to order, do you want to hear our specials. Completely awkward. So I just launched into my order. Still don't know if they had any specials.

Also my steak was bloody in the middle and I ordered it medium well. Didn't get to the bloody part until a quarter through my steak. Server only stopped by once, pretty much after our first few bites, so I couldn't easily tell him about it. At that point in our meal, did not think it was worth sending back.

The ugly:
After our plates were cleaned, we sat for about 10 minutes. Then our waiter dropped off the check. Never asked if we wanted dessert, coffee, after dinner drinks. What the heck?? That is the best part of the meal. And it was our anniversary! Definitely did not receive anything \"comped\" as other reviews mentioned. Not that I was looking for a freebie. Just that after not eating a good portion of my steak, I was looking forward to dessert!

I thought about contacting corporate for the restaurant. Then decided it was not worth it because admittedly some of my gripes and observations are subjective. How do you quantify the fact that a restaurant basically hurt your feelings?!

Yes, I had expectations based on price point and the overall description of the restaurant as romantic. Overall, I expect some semblance of warmth from the service. I expect staff to not be loudly talking about adults drinking breast milk (which my husband overheard). I expect clientele will not sing happy birthday at their large group table. I expect that picture taking with a flash by customers will be kept to a minimum in the dining room.

Bottom line: Unless you are 60+ from the suburbs of Cleveland or never eat out at \"nicer\" restaurants - just skip it. Much better options at this price point in the Cleveland area that are way more welcoming and polished. Definitely feel our server \"profiled\" us. Which was dumb on his part, I used to wait tables and notoriously over tip on a regular basis.

The upside:
We drove into Cleveland and went to Sweet Moses for dessert! And we are headed to Chicago on Friday and have reservations at an old favorite - The Chicago Chop House. I think they will be able to cook my steak properly."}
{"text":"This is one of those reviews where I'm relying on my college brain to remember my experience. So, lets just keep our fingers (and toes) crossed that I didn't kill off too many cells back then...

Don's Pomeroy House always seems to escape my mind when I'm thinking of nice steak houses to dine at in Cleveland. And let me tell you, it's not because I had a bad experience. In fact, I remember the food being very good--traditional, but tasty. 

The decor is a ton of dark woods, with a little romance and again, very traditional. You definitely get the charm of dining in an old house. Inside and out, it's adorable and whimsical enough to make you forget you're in the middle of suburb-a-hell.

I'm not sure if they've changed the menu since I visited last, but I think the whole place could probably use just a little updating, menu including. There is nothing wrong with a traditional steak house menu, but I think you can change a little bit with the times. You know, have a few modern twists on your menu just to liven things up. A little update never hurt anyone. Again, I'm not sure what has changed since I've been there, but even the decor looked a little--umm, for lack of a better word, old. 

So, why four stars still? Well, I'm actually looking forward to rediscovering this place. It's truly special. I mean, it's in the middle of chain/big box suburbia (read: Strongsville), yet it still maintains it's locally-owned business charm. Besides, I certainly think the food and the restaurant is worth driving out and giving it a try at least once--that is, if it's still anything like I remember.

Anyways... who's coming with me? I'm in the mood for some steak! Anyone? Bueller?"}
{"text":"Don's Pomeroy House has a formal atmosphere but fails to deliver high-quality or innovative food.

Pluses:
-Beautiful interior and historic building that set the formal atmosphere
-Items on the menu to try:
  -The Pomeroy salad is a sweet but tasty way to start the meal
  -Steak is correctly cooked and juicy
  -Chilean sea bass is good, and the accompanying crab cake is tasty
  -The walleye is a well-prepared local fish
  -Made-in-house chocolate mousse is an excellent way to end the meal

Negatives:
-Rushed service: At a higher-end restaurant, one would want to enjoy the meal in a relaxed manner. The staff tends to rush diners through the meal.
-Items not brought out together: Our appetizers were served as they were ready, rather than all at once. This may be a sign of a disorganized kitchen.
-Table cleared while people still eating: It is a pet peeve of mine at higher-end restaurants when some people's plates are taken away while others at the table are still eating. 
-Crowded dining rooms: While the antique building is beautiful, tables are crammed into the smaller rooms, making navigating to one's table and sitting down somewhat difficult
-The lump of green vegetables: Every main course I saw had a boring lump of green vegetables, usually green beans or asparagus, that were bland and added nothing to the flavors or identity of the dish as a whole.
-Bad presentation: Food comes piled on worn plates in a manner that is not aesthetically pleasing. In addition, all main courses seem to be served in the same manner.
-Instant mashed potatoes: For such a nice restaurant, I was disappointed to taste that the mashed potatoes were not freshly made. Some of the dishes try to make the potatoes interesting with lobster, but the base is still a disappointing cooking shortcut. 
-Items on the menu to avoid:
  -French onion soup is extremely salty, and the broth tastes like it is from a can
  -The tilapia is salty and somewhat bland
  -The calamari is overcooked and rubbery"}
{"text":"Come to this area from California maybe once a year. I make sure I always come to this restaurant at least one time during my visit. The dinner and wine (reasonably priced) were excellent! Our server was the best...Jennifer did an excellent job! The next time I am back I will definitely ask for her again."}
{"text":"A client recommended Don's Pomeroy House to me on my last visit to Strongsville, and I'm glad I took their recommendation!

The salmon with asiago risotto was probably the best salmon dish I've had, and I'm particular when it comes to salmon.

Great service and wonderful ambiance. It's expensive, but well worth every penny."}
{"text":"Disappointed. We stopped in on Mother's Day. Although the day was warm there was no patio seating. Okay, perhaps it was too early in the year. We were seated in the Pub, which is a nice setting. We were told there was no pub menu for the day only the main menu. I was not really hungary so ordered onion soup. It was very good. My husband had a seafood soup which was okay. He then received his salad which he considered a disaster. Ate very little of it. My son ordered the prime rib, medium. It arrived very rare and presentation left a lot to be desired. He did begin to eat and found it chewy. He ate very little and did take it home where he planned to reheat it. Our waitress did not seem to notice the amount of food left on the plates. Never asked if there was a problem with the food. We did not complain since we needed to move on. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Good!

Bistro salad, seabass, apple cheese cake and ice cream cookie. Cohorts had halibut special and steak."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic venue with a great menu.  The steaks were done to perfection, the appetizers were paired perfectly with some great craft beers.  My Walleye was fantastic, and was accompanied with roasted brussel sprouts, and sweet potato wedges.  If you want a fine dining experience, this would be a 5 star choice."}
{"text":"Only visited the Pub. And although I only gave it 2-stars, I would still go back. Then why the 2-stars?

1. Price. What can I say? It was expensive. It's not that I'm a cheapskate, but see item 2.

2. The food wasn't that good. It just wasn't. Coupled with the price I did not leave feeling that I had received an equitable value in return. 

So why go back? I like the place. Nice little pub. \"Decent\" beer selection. Friendly. I just won't visit too often. Again, it's pricey for Strongsville."}
{"text":"I've been here a lot and have dined in all of the areas- main dining room, pub and patio. The patio is easily my favorite spot and one of the best patios around. You don't feel like you're in Strongsville and on a busy road. Definently a must check-out on a nice summer night! The food here is amazing. I have had various selections on the menu and haven't had a bad meal yet. The Pomeroy House Salad, Veggie Burger and Teriyaki Salmon are some of my favorites though. The only reason I can't give this place a 5 (which I'd love to do) is because of the service. The last few times I have been eating in the pub the service has been super slow and not attentive. The last time I was here it took over a half hour to get our check and pay once we were done eating.Other than that this is easily my favorite restaurant in Strongsville."}
{"text":"One of the better steaks I've had. Hard to go wrong with a choice angus beef 14 oz sirloin though, as long as it's not over seasoned or over cooked. The shrimp cocktail was a bit fishy, and the price is steep for four shrimp regardless of the quality. 
Service and ambiance were great! Would recommend"}
{"text":"This place has been an icon in Northeast Ohio for a long time.  It has been called the most romantic restaurant in Northeast Ohio, and I admit that I have spent some time supporting that concept.  I have also used it for multiple business dinners as well, and booked Christmas parties here.  It is located in a beautiful, historic home.  It has dining on three floors, including private dining rooms for parties.  The decor is classy and classic.  If you wondered where Muzak went, it is playing in the main floor dining area, the lower floor is more trendy.  The menu is not large, and relatively basic.  It has a nice selection of seafood and meat entrees.  Most are relatively heavy in their presentation, not as light and healthy as some other menus.  Nice selection of salads and appetizers as well.  Full bar.  Service was attentive and good.  I guess it's all about taste and choices.  If you want classic decor, food and service, come here.  If you want trendy, newer and lighter menus, you might be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is just so-so. This place is overrated. There are some really great restaurants in Cleveland, but this is just a regular Sunday-dinner family joint."}
{"text":"Took my husband here for his birthday.  This is definitely one of our new favorite places.  Everything was incredible-the service and food."}
{"text":"Would love to be able to give a review of the food but, after over ten minutes sitting downstairs at the Pub we still had not had a waitress even so much as greet us. It was not by any means packed and plenty of wait staff were visible. With service this poor we didn't stick around."}
{"text":"I have had the pleasure of visiting Don's a handful of times.  I love going here and seeing what the off the menu specials are each time.  This is the kind of place where everything sounds so amazing and I have a hard time making up my mind.  Usually I go with a seafood or steak plate although I have even had vegan plates.  All have been delicious.  Service is great and i have even been treated to complimentary dessert just for being a valued guest.  I give this a 4 and not a 5 as the menu is a little confusing and can come across bland.  That being said, Ive always enjoyed the food and wish I could visit here more often"}
{"text":"The wine, steak, & scallops were phenominal. The service was impeccable. The atmosphere, unique & intriguing."}
{"text":"Super attentive service, but not overbearing and creepy.  Excellent food and suggestions. We all had the pre-fixe.  The crusted fish was superb, and the professional fisherman I was with agreed.  The filet was as it should be: melt in your mouth.  Good wine list. Open stairs to the downstairs; be careful with skirts/dresses!"}
{"text":"Best patio in the area. The downstairs pub is always a blast. Great food at a reasonable price in the pub downstairs. Formal dining upstairs."}
{"text":"Very good fine dining!  You can't go wrong no matter what you order at Don's!  This place never disappoints.  If you are looking to dine at peak times you will need to make a reservation as you might not be able to get in without one."}
{"text":"Recently moved here and my husband had been at this restaurant several times over the years.  He couldn't wait to take me there.  Was not impressed, unfortunately.  Food was very disappointing- 3 scallops for the meal?!  They were large, but no salad to start, you WILL be hungry when done.  Chilean sea bass was a decent size, but i had to send it back as the middle was cold!  Waitress informed us at that point (not before, as she should have) that ALL their seafood is served med-rare with the exception of the ahi tuna which is served rare.  That, most people would expect, but salmon and cod- medium-rare?!!??  The consistency just isnt right nor the taste.  Even the scallops were med-rare, affecting the taste.  When i sent back my sea bass, they put on a plate with new green beans, but scraped off the shiitake mushrooms!  New green beans, but nothing else?  So, if your server does not tell you, make sure you request how you want you seafood cooked."}
{"text":"My favorite patio in Strongsville! I love the pub!! It's warm, cozy and romantic! The service was impeccable, the food was outstanding, and the wine list was good too! The prices are higher but still affordable! You're paying for quality, outstanding service, and a great, historic atmosphere!"}
{"text":"First time here, had dinner with hubby and friends. Loved the history of the location along with a nice atmosphere. The ambiance is great!  Our food was amazing I had the salmon with cheese risotto and asparagus. It had great flavor. My husband had the chicken and waffles which he of course let me taste and indeed it was appetizing as well."}
{"text":"Last minute night out for my fiancé and myself.   Took the drive to Don's after hearing many great comments from clients about how great the place is.   We were able to get a last minute reservation from the host via phone.   Extremely kind and accommodating.   

Upon arrival, we see a truly cared for and well decorated historical building.   Valet was convenient because parking was very hard to come by during peak hours.    Host staff had us wait a few min even though we had a reservation, worth every minute.   We were sat at a table in front of a roaring fireplace.   Nice and warm. 

Menu was exquisite!   Something for everyone even as picky as me.   Wine selection was great though I could not pronounce many.   

Our server was on point.   Very relaxed and not rushing anything.   Our selections were perfectly portioned and prepared.   Proteins all cooked to perfection!   Side dishes were unreal!   

Oh and we saw these giant pastry being sent to every table for birthdays and special events.   We almost ordered one but were stuffed from our meals.   Take someone special here for an occasion or just to go out.   We will be back!   A truly amazing experience we will repeat ASAP."}
{"text":"the food was always decent here but the restaurant itself is too crowded, not as in people, but actual seating.  If the tables and chairs were any closer you'd be in a cafeteria.  The place is very, very dark as well.  Outside patio ok, but overall a little pricey and portions ok."}
{"text":"The patio is the best around during warn weather months, and the pub is fantastic on a week night or for date night. We've enjoyed many items from the pub menu, as well as the main house menu and have never left disappointed! 

My favorites have to be the short rib tacos for casual dinners...or the filet never disappoints. 

If you're celebrating a birthday make sure you keep room for the amazing eclair at the end of your meal...its worth the extra calories and indulge on your birthday!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!! We had such a great experience. The food was delicious. The service was exceptional. The building is historic and just had such a nice vibe. I got the North Atlantic Yellowfin Tuna. It was delightful. It is seared rare and served with bok choy, coconut rice, mango relish and wasabi. I loved it. My husband got the filet mignon which he loved too. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Strongsville's best restaurant!! In the summertime they have the greatest patio, and you can order off of the pub or main restaurant menu! Can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but I am partial to the scallops which come with lobster mashed potatoes. They always have delicious specials going on as well. Love the quaintness of the main restaurant! I've never had a bad dining experience at Don's and it has been a favorite of mine and my husbands for a few years. Service is great, menu is delicious, and the atmosphere is wonderful whether you're in the pub, on the patio, or in the restaurant! Truly a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful server who was knowledgeable about the menu and all the timing of food and drinks was perfect. The maitre d, since it was our first visit, gave us a tour of the pub area and house. I love old houses, so the atmosphere was particularly enjoyable for me. The food, while not especially creative or unique, was still perfectly prepared, generously portioned and delicious. We shared the calamari in sweet chili sauce which was very good. I wish it had been a bit crisper w less sauce though. We also ordered the crab Caesar salad, again delicious w lots of chunked crab meat. For entrees I had the Chilean sea bass which came with a crab cake, green beans and shitake mushrooms. The fish was cooked perfectly. ..loved the sear. My date had the strip steak with mashed potatoes which was also served with green beans and mushrooms. We visited on Valentine's day and they ran out of the chocolate covered strawberry dessert special so we skipped the sweets but there were plenty of good choices on the menu. I liked that they offerred half portions, most around $5, so if you had room, you could order a couple options to share. I also found overall, for the quality, the prices to be reasonable. The ONLY area for improvement is the awful elevator music that played in the dining area. At one point I started to faintly recognize 80s hits instrumental version only minus the lyrics. Overall, we're happy we ventured to the 'burbs from our Cleveland base this Valentine's Day. No downtown traffic or trekking in the snow! Free immediately outside restaurant parking and valet offerred."}
{"text":"In summer, there is no place finer for a meal in a pleasant setting than Don's Patio.  It is so quaint, you don't realize you are so near a major intersection(Pearl Rd & Rt 82).  Service is gracious(ScottLynn waited on us several times, and may just be the most polite, pleasant individual ever!)! The cod and fries is my favorite and my wife swears by the scallops!

The Pub downstairs is always beautifully decorated around Christmas, and is a very comfortable place for a quiet meal, and a fine location to celebrate special occasions!

We have eaten there on Thanksgiving the past few years.  They offer a limited regular menu, along with the fabulous Feast!"}
{"text":"Won't be going back.  Took a client there for lunch, and was embarrassed; had to make apologies for the small portions.  We ordered a Georges Bay Scallop lunch entree ($17), which only had 2 medium sized scallops on the plate and a scoop of risotto.  Nothing else.  No garnish. Just a white plate with a lot of white food on it.  Unappetizing, at best. 
I ordered the Scallop Salad ($14.50), and it was the same thing ... lots of greens, and only 2 scallops.  Granted, the scallops were perfectly prepared, but at these prices, I at least expected to see 3 scallops on a lunch portion.  Plus, I ordered soup, which the waitress completely forgot to bring.
The restaurant itself has been refurbished, but it's still \"historic\" and filled with blue hairs.  It is not a good value, and they don't offer anything unique or interesting.  That was my last visit there."}
{"text":"My family and I had a delicious meal at the pomeroy house! The service was outstanding and the food was even better. Very cozy & classic atmosphere which I love. I came here with my family but it would be an amazing romantic date spot as well!"}
{"text":"Attended a 50th Anniversary celebration on 10/03/15 @ Don's Pomeroy House in honor of my brother & sister-in-law. Very impressed with food, service, attention to detail, and ambiance! I believe the main server was Jessica. She was exceptional and put everyone at ease. She was assuring everyone there was plenty of sparkling wine & poured it with a smile. Will definitely recommend Pomeroy House to friends, and plan to make reservations there for our future special occasions & milestones. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Great place for a business lunch/break from work.  We ate in the pub (in the basement), and we enjoyed all of our meals.  

Nice atmosphere and quick service."}
{"text":"Food took entirely too long. Visited it 2 times in one month (had gift certificates). Then, everything was just so so. I had made a special request. Waitress didn't write it down. Order was not correct. 

Highly overrated by Strongsville residents. We really need a nice, unique restaurant, but this ain't it!"}
{"text":"Great Price! Great food! I would highly recommend Don's for a nice dinner for any occasion.

Great staff as well."}
{"text":"GREAT appetizers - we had the Brussels sprouts w/ bacon, crab dip and ahi tuna. The soup (seafood w/ tomato base) was delicious, as well. I was a little disappointed with the surf n turf...the 6 oz. filet was not quite rear as I ordered, and the lobster could have been fresher, especially given the price tag.

All in all, good meal for a business dinner, with a decent wine selection, formal (but not stuffy) ambiance and friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"This was the best meal I have had in strongsville. The upper dining room is perfect for your entire family. Food was well prepared and what variety this menu has to offer is off the charts. Thank you for great service and an excellent meal."}
{"text":"I've been driving past Don's Pomeroy House for years and was always intrigued by their lighted patio; it looked so romantic and beautiful. My husband surprised me this year with dinner at this gem for our anniversary.

I will agree with previous posters who said that the clientele seems to be mostly older but we still very much enjoyed ourselves. Our service was outstanding! There are people attending to your every need. Runners scouted the dining room consistently, whisking away glasses for refills of beverages, dirty plates were never left on table for longer than five minutes, and you weren't left just sort of \"hanging\" in between courses. Our server made herself available without being too overbearing by making sure to pass our table often should we need to get her attention.

The food was delicious; we took advantage of every area of the menu, ordering an appetizer, soup selection, salad,  and both our meals. We were not disappointed by anything we tasted. We didn't get a chance to order dessert because the restaurant provided a complimentary one when they found out we were celebrating our anniversary. They also took our photo and gave it us with a card wishing us a Happy Anniversary. A nice touch, in my opinion.

The ambiance was terrific, as the restaurant is housed in a home dating back to the late 1800's. They have private party rooms upstairs, two dining rooms on the main floor, and pub-style eating (with bar) downstairs. The patio is gorgeous and I hope to visit again and sit there!

As expected, this was a more expensive place to dine but both my husband and I really enjoyed ourselves. We had a nice meal without feeling as though we needed to be dressy (we dressed business casual and felt completely comfortable). Give them a try!"}
{"text":"We recently ate at the \"Pub\" for lunch. It's in the basement and has a different menu than the main restaurant, at least during lunch. The service was good but the food took a long time to come out. We had three appetizers and they were great. We highly recommend the calamari. The fish and chips was excellent as well. Worth the wait but be prepared for it."}
{"text":"Took mom here for Mother's Day./birthday. One of her faves.  Mom got surf and turf, around $50...she enjoyed tremendously, and I got tons of good daughter points. Hubby got scallops, which he enjoyed, I got small steak, which was good.  We also got onion soup gratin, very yummy. 

Server was wonderful. 

Special we're presented, and surprisingly, the prices for them were in line with the menu, not the oxymoronic usual of \"specials\" breaking the bank. 

A HUGE eclair with a candle was brought out for mom at the end of the meal....more daughter points. 

Easy parking, or valet if so inclined.  We were upstairs this time, but the pub is kinda cool too. 

Is the menu cutting edge? No it is not, but what they do, they do well. Mom loved it, and that's what mattered."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentine's Day dinner. We had a 7pm reservation, arrived a few minutes before 7 and didn't get seated until 7:15pm. Understandable because of the holiday, but slightly off putting. We started with French onion soup which was very good. It had a great flavor and wasn't too heavy. Bread and butter were good, but standard. I had the 8 ounce filet mignon with mashed potatoes and green beans, which was good, but very charred. I ordered medium well, but wasn't expecting it to be as burnt as it was. I covered it with the demi glaze and mashed potatoes. My husband ordered the Maine lobster tail with the same sides. He thought it was lovely. He enjoyed the flavor. Their dessert menu looked very tasty, but we were too full."}
{"text":"Ate in the pub.  Nice atmosphere, good food and friendly, attentive service.  It was nice to be able to order from either the Pub menu or the main dining menu.  They opened at 5 and we arrived at 540 to already have a 30 minute wait.  The place was packed after being open only 40 minutes.  I had the steak oscar.  Was done nicely and had great flavor.  Mashed potatoes were tastey, as was asparagus.  I still have a soft spot in my heart for Hyde Park...but this review is for Don's.  I'll definitely go back and try the short ribs next time.  Side note to restaurant manager, get rid of the sugar packets and advertisment flyers in the middle of the table.  At a table of four with a party of four this left little rooms for sides, rolls, drinks, etc...also it's pretty tacky.  Reminds me of TGIFridays or a place of that calaber."}
{"text":"Don's Pomeroy House is an upscale, beautiful restaurant in downtown Strongsville, OH.  This place rocks!  If you're looking to have a few drinks with friends, what better place to do it than in the remodeled basement of a farmhouse.  The structure was nearly destroyed due to extenisve water damage long ago, but it was rescued and thankfully was turned into an excellent restaurant.

Don's Pomeroy House has some beautiful decor and antiques and if you make reservations, they may allow you to choose which room you dine in.  

On my first trip to Don's, I went with a group of co-workers for drinks and appetizers.  The atmosphere was nice and the full menu looked delicious.  I thought to myself, \"I've got to try this place for dinner sometime\".

My second trip to Don's was on my wedding night!  I had the filet mignon and to date, it's one of the best I've had.  Their mashed potatoes are amazing!.  What's a great steak without wine?  They have a full wine list and their Cabernet Sauvignon is great.  Since we had a party of eight, we had a dedicated waiter who peeked at us every few minutes from behind a wall to see if we needed anything.  The waiter really made us feel special that night.

My third trip to Don's was on my anniversary!  I enjoyed a salmon dinner with my wife and of course, I had the mashed potatoes again.  We shared some champagne and they threw in a free dessert.  Everything was excellent, yet again.

The Pomeroy House is an expensive restaurant, but once in a while, it's okay to treat yourself.  With excellent food and service in a historic setting, Don's Pomeroy House is one of the best restaurants in all of Ohio.

We were on the road between NYC & Chicago. The cats were scared shitless back at the Red Roof Inn and were desperate for good food. we'd spent the day on the road with two crying cats in our crammed Corolla and, did I mention we were sick of rest stop food? We were looking for a place called \"VuuDuu\" that had just opened. We never found it, but we did find heaven's patio.

Don's house was incredible. It was dusk in early summer & the back patio was the perfect place to have an incredible meal, have some strong drinks and forget 500 miles of driving.

The food itself was mind-blowing. Honestly, it was 4 months ago, so I don't remember what we ate, but I do remember enjoying an absolutely incredible meal. A meal so good it makes you gush to the manager, the hostess & even the valet."}
{"text":"This place is great no matter the season. In the winter there's the dark cozy pub which is especially cute during the holidays. In the summer there's a great patio with twinkly lights in the trees and everything.

Drinks are good, wine list is good. Food is good too. Certainly not the healthiest of meals, but who cares when the ambiance is so nice. And who cares when it's 20 degrees outside! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food. My steak is always done perfectly.  They also have  a beautiful outside patio with great lighting and such.  It's the perfect spot to chill at in the summer.  All around great food and excellent service by all the staff.  I went once on Mother's Day and they had hundreds of flowers that they were giving away to every single mom which was really nice!"}
{"text":"I still can't decide if I enjoyed my steak or my dates grouper meal more. Either way, this was the best meal I've had in a long time.

I forgot how lovely the Pomeroy House was inside. It has the romantic, classic vibe of an old steakhouse without the lingering smoke and stale décor that you'd normally find. They have managed to preserve the history of the building and restaurant and still offer excellency in service and a menu that rivals swanky NY steakhouses. 
There are several private dining areas, a beautiful patio and a more casual pub downstairs. My favorite are the library booths upstairs. So romantic.

I started with a glass of wine, a basket of perfectly baked sourdough bread and the Florida gulf shrimp cocktail. Yes, I did get 4 shrimp for $17. I'm not going to lie... this was not a cheap meal. But every bite to every dollar was entirely worth it. The shrimp were plump, fresh and served with lemon and cocktail sauce. It satisfied a long craving I've had for shrimp that wasn't wimpy or slimy.

My meal was the CAB Texas Sirloin Oscar. A perfectly grilled center cut steak, delicious mashed potatoes, lump crab, asparagus and a flavorful béarnaise sauce. I was in heaven. Every bite was delectable and a real treat.
I sampled a bit from my BF who had a gorgeous plate of Nags Head black grouper. The panko parmesan crust was perfectly crispy, fish was tender and flaky. I loved the smoked tomato beurre blanc. 

Honestly, I expected Pomeroy House to be over-hyped and old news. It's been around since the 70's and Strongsville isn't exactly known for fine dining.
Boy, was I wrong."}
{"text":"I was visiting Strongsville for a family occasion and apparently this place is a long stand favorite for many locals. 

The servers were fantastic. In fact, I returned to this place next day as well because of warm service and amazing food. 

I highly recommend grilled romaine salad with steaks on the side. At first, when the server said it's one of their specialties, I was like, \"sure, I will give it a try.\" But I am glad that I decide to order it. 

They have three different seatings, one outdoor area, indoor restaurant area, and bar area. Wherever you decide to eat, you can order everything on the menu. In other words, you can still order restaurant menu at the bar. 

I will definitely come back to this place again when I visit Strongsville. It was such pleasant experience."}
{"text":"This was my dad's favorite place to eat out at when he lived in Cleveland so as a result i've been there a few times.  Every experience i'd had was stellar.  

The downstairs has a very homey rustic atmosphere to it.  The bar is nice and the booths are comfortable.

The outside would be my preferred route.  The waitresses are cute, friendly, and attentive.  The wine selection is nice and they have a decent cabernet.  I'm relatively certain every single time I went here I had the Chilean sea bass.  Yeah they're endangered and you really should eat renewable fish but its their fault for tasting so damn good.  They're practically killing themselves off.  Its up there in my top 5 best fish experiences ever.  Their mashed potatoes are also excellent and as I remember they have a decent beer selection.  Now keep in mind I never had to pick up the tab here so eat and drink up for me.  I would save this place for special occasions were I you."}
{"text":"My bf took me here for my birthday this weekend and I really enjoyed the food!! The scallops,salmon, and crab cake were amazing! The only complaint I sort of had was our server was an older man and when we first got there it seemed like he didn't wanna be there or really serve us.. When I was done with my dinner he asked us what the occasion was and he came out with a eclair cake and wished me happy bday which was really nice but I wish his attitude was a little better when we got there. Great food and great romantic atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I have such fond memories of Don's from when my family went when I was younger, but I feel things have changed, at least on the patio. 

The service on the patio just wasn't at 100%. The server didn't check back all that often. I was offered another beer when mine was still full, but when the glass was empty it sat for some time before the server reappeared. I ordered a blue moon which at even dive bars warrants an orange slice, but none was offered - the server didn't even pour the bottled beer into a glass. 

I enjoyed the calamari as an appetizer. I thought the artichoke was a nice and unique addition to the dish that I haven't seen elsewhere. My meatloaf was disappointing though. It didn't have that homemade fresh taste to it. The edges were also a bit crispy as if it had been reheated a bit too long and the mashed potatoes, while tasty, had that heat lamp congealed look to them. My friend's Chicken Ban Mi, while a large serving size, again missed the house made flavor. The fries tasted/looked as if they were frozen. Also disappointing was the fact that according to the server the dressing for the Cesar salad was bottled and not made in house, a simple place to add value.

The patio still is gorgeous. Even though on a busy road the tree cover keeps things quiet. The lights overhead make for a nice atmosphere and I did enjoy relaxing on the patio of this gorgeous house."}
{"text":"It's generally a nice place to eat but a bit old fashioned.  If you're looking for trendy this isn't the place to go."}
{"text":"We went for a 60th birthday party. There were 8 in our party. While our waiter was very attentive and surprised us with a complementary dessert, food was average. Two of us had the lobster tail and both were overcooked and tough. Those who ordered filet said they were good but not great. The same goes for the scallops.  

I think that because we have had great meals in the past at Don's, we hold them to a high standard. This meal was just not up to those standards. Will we return again?  Yes, but we will expect better than what we got this evening."}
