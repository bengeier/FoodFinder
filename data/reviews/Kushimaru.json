{"text":"Food was good, price is iffy (high).
Was going to have GB Pulled Noodles next door but noticed that this place finally has opened. I was hesistant about the prices and I think anyone would be taken aback by them. A solo piece of veggie on a skewer for $2...that is insane. Even for two pieces of veggies at $2 is quite high. 
Anyways we wanted to try this type of Japanese cuisine and opted for the comvo ($18.99) and 2 extra skewers. Although the combo says 2 meats +2 seafood + 4 veggies, note that these are what the chef chooses, not you. 

All the meats (beef, chicken breast) were tender and the veggies were cooked well. Okra wasn't slimy, scallop was huge, lotus root was cooked but crunchy. Thin batter, but it's tasteless on its own. Very pleased with the food except for the high price point. 

There's no communal tonkotsu dipping bowl, which may be for the better here. But there is a really awesome housemade tonkotsu sauce and green tea salt (which is super salty). 

Staff very nice, possibly too attentive. 

Would we come back? Probably not...it was nice to try though!"}
{"text":"Finally! The kushi age place open in downtown Toronto. Good quality food, nice service!"}
{"text":"The atmosophere and staff are superb the food is great my sold complaint would be some of the proportioning of the food"}
{"text":"I'm so glad kushikatsu has finally arrived in Toronto! I ordered the set for $18.99 which included 8 different skewers, soup, rice and cabbage - a good option if you're visiting for the first time and not sure what to order. I enjoyed most of the items but the veggies were probably my favourites. I also loved their miso soup! Service was also pretty good, but prices are definitely a bit steep given you can get kushikatsu in Japan for half the price."}
{"text":"They don't know how to manage the restaurant. There was one table with customers when I got in.. which means they were not busy. However, most of the tables were not cleaned up!!  They leave it uncleaned until next customers came in. And I am pretty sure that waitress was not busy she was just hanging around near the cashier area. Also the food that we ordered wasn't that great either. I can give 2 out of 10. Curry that they ate using felt like 100% instant (s&b golden curry) and the soup was not salty enough. The fried skewers were okay but nothing special...(similar texture with frozen nugget)  Also, we had soup and curry, but it only came with folks. So we had to ask for spoons... 
Overall, very poor management and foods weren't special.. They really need to improve themselves if they want to last in the location."}
{"text":"This place has good options, generous sizes and better value than other ramen DT. You can even select four different sizes of noodles. My bowl was so tasty and I was extremely full on $10, a small. I was just annoyed by the server telling us where to leave tips to both my friend and I. Initially I was going to tip more :$"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for dinner, ordered the daily special, soft shell crab, and a mix of skewers to try. Portions were pretty small for the price point. Most items are pretty much bite size. Aside from the size, the taste was pretty good, batter was light and crispy, and the inside was piping hot but not dry.  
Staff was super friendly and attentive, they always made sure our gasses were never empty. 
They didn't have a dessert menu but they do offer deep fried Oreos, which were the highlight of the meal.
Nice play to try out but probably wouldn't be rushing to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I love kushiage! For the longest time I've been wondering why such a restaurant doesn't exist in Toronto... But I feel like this could've been a better experience.

I ordered the lunch combo with the assorted kushiage and the second combo with the curry kushiage. Although it came with a soup, salad and rice, it did feel pricier than other restaurants. The taste was a bit bland but there are sauces on the table to flavour it. Overall food should do with some improvement but the decor in the restaurant is really cute!"}
{"text":"Went in for the $5 take out combo for 3 skewers. The combo gives 1 meat or seafood and 2 vegetables. We were told by accident the combo was 1 of each a meat, seafood and veg and they honored it anyways. It was a short wait by the standing bar and we were still given excellent service by the staff who asked if we needed anything for the wait. Its little touches that made our visit more pleasant. 

Batter is light and crispy, and they recommend either lots of sauce or green tea salt on it since the skewers come unseasoned on their own. I got a chicken breast, scallop and the cheese and they were all so delicious! Chicken was nice and moist. Scallop was cooked tenderly without being rubbery. The cheese was a surprising favorite! Melty with still a bit of bite to it so it doesn't get everywhere. 

Will definitely be back. Keep in mind they only take cash for orders under $10 so if you're coming for just the combo bring some change with you."}
{"text":"The price is pretty high, especially for what you get, which is deep fried things. Just as the other review says, the skewers are extremely pricy, and if you want to eat here and leave happily with full belly, you would spend more than 30 dollars per person, tip and tax not included, and you are not even satisfied. All the items are not really flavourful, all the flavour come from the green tea salt and the sauce provided on the side, so the only thing you taste is the sauce, and the sauce itself isn't very special. I think you can pretty much get the exact same thing from the supermarket. 
The service is pretty good tho, you could come here, if you are really curious about Japanese style fried things. I would recommend zakkushi if you really want to try some decent food. The price here is not cheap as well, but at least you get decent food and drink."}
{"text":"Kushimaru is a Japanese skewer \"Osaka street food\" restaurant and takeout location that recently opened up at Bay/Elm, beside the very popular GB Hand-Pulled Noodles and taking the place of the Waynak Modern Halal Eatery and the New York pizza place before that. They had their soft opening on May 5, 2018 after many many months of renovation.

My dinner companion and I each got a combo set. The combo set came with a good mix of fish, meat and veggie choices. While you couldn't choose what went into the set, they were very accommodating with \"don't-wants\", for example if you didn't want fish, or meat, etc. The combo platter is served with rice (more on that later), miso soup with lots of ingredients and a salad.

The best skewer is by far the cheese skewer (which I didn't get as part of the combo but requested later), which is best eaten fresh and hot! It was incredibly soft and stringy - stretching for as long as you would pull it. It also cooled down very quickly, so you have to enjoy it while it lasts.

The oyster skewer (also not part of the combo), bacon-wrapped leek, cauliflower and salmon rounded out my other top choices of the ones served in the combo. The only one I didn't enjoy was the beef. All the skewers have delicately thin crispy breading and the filling was soft/juicy and never overcooked.

The skewers are served in a combo with spicy mayo sauce. At the table matcha salt and a thick brown sauce are available. I asked more than once what the brown sauce was and still don't have an answer... but nevertheless it's still good.

I'm by no means a rice expert, but I did note that they didn't use the short grain Japanese rice that I expected.

The seating area is unfortunately small, with just several tables and bar seating available. They seem to have set themselves up as a takeout restaurant, even though they have great customer service and place settings (pro tip: the pretty bamboo cup is for your used skewers). Staff are very pro-active - if you look at them they will come right away to see if they can help you.

The staff are quite new but they had lots of staff on hand. I noticed after the fact that they had only charged me for the combo price ($18.99) without HST when I looked at my credit card slip after. The combo price or the other dishes are the only things worth getting - the premium for buying skewers individually is way too high.

They say that they do not use nuts in their food."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend for lunch and thought the food was very authentic and brought back memories of Osaka! 

I got the lunch combo curry vegetable skewers and I thought the portions (of the sides) were very large for 1 person. The salad bowl was too big imo. Felt like a chore trying to finish it, and was not really able to enjoy my kushiage fully. And I am not a fan of the curry sauce, even though it says it is home made, it was too overpowering, and it actually took away from the kushiage and outshone the kushiage in the meal. The salt shaker and the sauce on the side were really important in making kushiage taste great, it is how it is meant to be eaten in case anyone was wondering why their skewers were bland.

I would appreciate it if the restaurant would create affordable kushiage skewer combos only... as in a purely kushiage order. Afterall, people need to get their drink on and have some crispy snacks to go w their drinks.  The a la cart prices are steep, which makes it prohibitive to order only kushiage. 

I found service to be good; wait staff were very attentive and refilled our drinks promptly and brought us our bill upon request."}
{"text":"I don't get all the complaints about price on other reviews.  Prices seem fine for what you get - which is deep-fried stuff on sticks.

I got a lunch set and all the deep-fried stuff on sticks were good - cooked well and fresh.  Miso soup was good - lots of stuff in it too!.  Rice was good.  Tonkatsu sauce was good.

The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the beef stew that came with my lunch set, which was gristly and chewy and not particularly flavourful.

Service seemed a bit slow considering the place was mainly empty when we were there, but overall a good experience.

Won't be top of my restaurant list, but I'd happily eat here again."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this new Japanese Restaurant since they opened a month ago. Heard good things about it and I must, it was all true!!

Ordered a lunch special. I think it was $12.99-14.99 ish. A normal price point for a lunch set with soup, salad and rice.  I was here for the skewers but the lunch set descriptions wasn't too clear.  No worries. Asked and got clarifications. It was pretty much the mix skewer set with Chicken, veggies, Shrimp, and fish skewer. It comes with rice, beef brisket, salad and kimchi.  I'm not a big fan of anything spicy and asked if I could swap that with something else. The waiter went and asked the cook.  Ended up with some yummy seaweed instead. Thank You!

The skewers were cooked perfectly. Very tasty, even without the soya sauce and salt.  They have this wooden tube for you to add the salt and you can stick in your skewer :) 

Half way through my meal the waiter came up asked me how I was doing and offered me a free bowl of rice (if I wanted). Obviously, I said yes! 

Excellent service. Excellent food. Everything was perfect! Will definitely be back again with companies!

Highlight of the visit: Asked me if I want a free bowl of rice lol

{"text":"This place is authentic, I found the prices to be fair (we dropped by for lunch), and I'm just excited to have a different kind of Japanese restaurant nearby.

The food is tasty and they don't seem to skimp on portions. If you're stopping at Uncle Tetsu's for cheesecake, you gotta jump across the street to try this place out."}
{"text":"Very overpriced for what it is. 5 pieces of sliced cucumber with soy sauce over it for $5? No. Waiter recommended to add a lot of sauce on our skewers...why would you want to do that unless you're making up for the lack of flavour in your food. Which it was. Just completely lacking in any flavour at all. Edemame was also really overpriced and undercooked!! I don't think I've ever had undercooked edemame before. Not even at a cheap AYCE restaurant. Is it that hard to try one before serving to make sure they're cooked?? 

Anyway the service was good but that's not enough to compensate for bad quality food and expensive prices. Would not go again."}
