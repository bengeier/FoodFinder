{"text":"Our favourite pizza in Calgary! Lots of cheese and toppings on a perfectly cooked crust. It is fantastic!"}
{"text":"This pizza is one of the typical western Canada styles - deep pan and thick crust, and the toppings are under the cheese.  A few things set it apart, though. There's an above average amount of cheese, and it's loaded with herbs and browned on top. In fact the whole crust is cooked to a medium brown. And Jeanne's pizza is really filling - which explains their large being only 12\".  That said, I thought my pizzas (Classic Greek and Hawaiian) were OK, but I don't love the slightly-overcooked quality enough to give Jeanne's a glowing review. The bottom of the Hawaiian, especially, was tough. But if you love heavy, filling pizza and a ton of browned cheese, you might really like Jeanne's."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza grew up having it when it started in a little town of Alex Alberta and now it's in Calgary, everything is amazing there"}
{"text":"Nothing makes me happier than coming home from a weeks long work trip, and ordering Jeanne's Pizza. Hands down the best pizza in the city."}
{"text":"Love this pizza place!  Owners are friendly and give great service. Pizza is delicious,a little crispy on the edges yet thick doughy crust and lots of great toppings. Everything tastes fresh, and definitely hits the spot. Not as greasy as chain places yet and offers great quality. A little pricey but worth it for me. Especially when I'm craving pizza and not the grease/ and who-knows-what toppings.  My recommendation: Wild Cat Special :)"}
{"text":"Just try it! They have an amazing gluten free crust from a local bakery and a homemade tomato sauce that makes this pizza better than the rest. Just mention any allergies and they will give you suggestions for the best options. Oh, and the salads are fresh and huge! A pizza that reminds me of being a kid at an Italian restaurant for the first time. So c'mon, let's support our local independent businesses! (especially with that darn Pizza 73 right next door...)"}
{"text":"We order from here often...Every time we are done we always say how tasty it was. Our favorite is the Old House pizza and the Chicken Fettuccine."}
{"text":"Ordered a cheese pizza and it was just ok. To me it tasted a little overdone but maybe I'm just particular about my cheese pizzas  Ordered for pickup and the pizza was ready on time. Bonus to the nice lady for giving my kids free gum from the gumball machine"}
{"text":"Wow!  Great pizza. Great flavours. We had the meat lover and old house. Crust is great. Cheese baked right to the edge. So filling and delicious.  Generous with the toppings and cheese.  Such nice people. Love supporting a local family business.  Absolutely worth the drive from where we live.  (Somerset). Recommend 100%"}
{"text":"PURE AWESOMENESS!! all I have to say, The western is my new favourite pizza in calgary"}
{"text":"While over at a friends place, we decided to order some pizza to munch on while having a movie night. We decided to try Jeanne's since he lives right around the corner from it (literally).  I knew from the moment we walked in to pick up my order, me and my buddy were in for a special treat. When we walked in we were greeted right away. Informed that our order was just being made, I decided to peek into the back and watch my pizza being made. Loved being able to do that and see how fresh everything looked!  When the order was ready to go, the pizza had a good weight to it. Had to be careful not to drop it. When we opened the box, the first thing I noticed was a little piece of warm soft bread in the middle to keep the cheesy goodness from sticking to the box.   The pizza was thick and loaded with toppings. Everything was in perfect balance. It was a work of art. Screw Chicago Deep Dish. If you want an awesome thick pizza, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Calgary my whole life and tried dozens of pizza places and this is, by far, the best. Loaded with fresh topping Gooey, stringy cheese everywhere Great bread Fantastic sauce. It's perfect Also nice people too"}
{"text":"Great pizza, you will not be disappointed with quality and taste. Kicks butt over most of the comparison."}
{"text":"Great quality, filling  pizza and  friendly service. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Pizza was hot, fresh, & filling! It was delivered faster then we expected! Definitely ordering again...best family owned pizza in our area by far! Be prepared to be thrilled pizza- lovers!"}
{"text":"Their gluten free pizza is absolutely delicious and their house made garlic dip is incredible. Such great people who run it too...LOVE supporting local businesses!"}
{"text":"Good deep dish; kinda expensive. We had House Special. Among we 3 who consumed the pie, we liked it fine, but agreed if we wanted pizza again when visiting we'd try someplace else. Owner/operator is very friendly."}
{"text":"I love Jenne's pizza, so good.   pizza is delicious, I love the panzarotti its my favorite (its like a pizza pop but waaaaay better :) )  the people are very nice and friendly, highly recommend it for anyone :)"}
{"text":"Tried this tonight for the first time and LOVED it. Generous toppings and cheese, great flavour. I had two pieces and should have stopped, but it was so good I grabbed two more and now I am so full I feel like my stomach is going to explode. This pizza was worth every cent!"}
{"text":"I would give this more stars if I could! The best pizza in Calgary, It's terrible to keep it a secret, needs to be discovered by all. A small independently owned and operated pizza place. The owner is a gem. The pizza is WOW! I order the Vegetarian, but get beef added to it, Not Veggie anymore, but easier to order, pineapple, fresh tomatoes, home made ground beef. it's Fresh! The Wings are terrific, always get the Hot ones. The place is named after the owners mom, rightfully as the recipes originated by the Mom, Home made recipes. Give this place a try and get the word out, it's in a different part of the city from where I live but Worth the drive.  I'm craving Jeanne's now as I'm writing this review, enjoy discovering Jeanne's!"}
{"text":"That is right. This pizza is great - firm crust (with toppings on), zesty sauce (not runny) with a good aroma (pepperoni & real mushroom). Yum! The other diner had a panzarotti with a side caesar salad for $7.25. I will return as service was fast - (20) minutes from call in to pick up. New location - 2741 -17th Avenue SW.
