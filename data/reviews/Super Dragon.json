{"text":"Been coming here for years, always delicious food, served super fast, no matter how busy.

Service is excellent! Looking for real asian food? Head out to what my family calls, \"Super D.\"

Pan fried noodles, salt and pepper pork chop are our faves."}
{"text":"real chinese food, excellent price"}
{"text":"Wonderful Chinese food for a very fair value.  
My favorites Salt & Pepper Shrimp with the shell. But no shrimp head oh well. It's hard to find Chinese food cooked for Chinese and not the american palette.
Also Salt & Pepper pork, Sea Bass House seafood on crispy noodles. Black pepper Beef. They also do celebrate Chinese New Year and offer a Special Menu that is also very tasty."}
{"text":"I hate to give a place two stars, but it was entirely based on the food.    I didn't really like anything I ordered.  The service was fine, and the ambiance was pleasant enough...

I had the won ton soup, house fried rice and the Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce.  The won tons were cool in the middle and the soup had frozen veggies in it - I have never seen won ton soup with peas.  

The house fried rice was flat and greasy.  My dinner companion commented that the house fried rice was more like what you find on the east coast, if that means anything to you.

The sauce ion the broccoli was twice as salty as they soy sauce.  Frankly, I was just really unimpressed.  I won't be back.

Does anyone know where to get good Chinese in Phoenix, because I sure don't."}
{"text":"Great food.  Friendly service.  The best Chinese in America food we've found in Phoenix.  Go there.  Eat.  Be happy.  Thank me."}
{"text":"This has always been our favorite local Chinese take out - and especially on Chinese New Year, the special menu.  OMG its good.  We always call for takeout, one or two items and we are so close that by the time I get in the car and drive there, its done...less than five minutes.  

This place gets very busy, and if you get a chance, try out their Peking Duck, Hong Kong style.  Soooo delicious!

Another favorite is the snow pea leaves (not on the menu!!!  cost extra), and the Seafood Bean Curd Soup.  I love the soup here, so many delicious morsels, you can't go wrong with it ever."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and the chicken was good quality, that's a plus in my book. Everything was prepared well and tasted great. Service was fast and friendly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Consistent excellent food. Great service at a very reasonable price. I recommend the house chicken, lemon chicken and the Mongolian beef. The lunch menu is such a great deal. Literally cheaper than fast food and so much better. Have never had a bad meal there."}
{"text":"Super Dragon is my favorite Chinese restaurant. It was a wonderful surprise after so many disappointing buffets and sit down Chinese restaurants. The egg drop soup, crab puffs, orange chicken, Cantonese noodles, and pork fried rice are my favorite foods to get there - but you can't go wrong here. Everything is delicious! 

The service is fantastic. You are seated as soon as you walk in the door, and you won't wait more than ten minutes to get your food. They keep your drinks full and will pack up your leftovers for you. Great prices too. I eat here at least once a week."}
{"text":"the best chinese food in Phoenix, Even my chinese relatives from LA give
it a thumbs up.  That speaks volumes about the place.
Try the set menu for complete meals, ask for the owner to help
translate the chinese descriptions.
Also order the Peking duck in advance to really impress your guests.
The set menu start with a soup and then multiple entrees ranging
from fish shrimp pork chicken n veggies served in typical chinese
family style 6-8 people."}
{"text":"Super Dragon's main menu is filled with Americanized Chinese food which I ignored as soon as I saw the single page laminated menu in pure Chinese.  The two dishes we ordered were delicious and reminded me of food cooked at my grandma's house in Hong Kong.

The Chinese menu is filled mainly with Cantonese food except for the obligatory Peking duck.  We ordered the bitter melon stir-fried with 3 kinds of diced eggs (salted duck eggs, preserved eggs and regular eggs).  The hints of bitterness nicely balanced the creaminess of the preserved eggs and savoriness of the salted eggs.

The weather was cold so we wanted a braised dish served in a hotpot.  We ordered the mixed veg with dried shrimp and vermicelli (aka mung bean thread) in hotpot.  What came instead of the vermicelli was black moss and the addition of tofu, which was not mentioned.  We didn't mind because we really liked the dish esp the black moss which is a more expensive and rare ingredient.  The flavors were spot on, well-balanced and very comforting.

I'm guessing that food from the Chinese menu is so rarely ordered that the kitchen confused what I ordered with another vegetarian dish on that menu.  I need to find out the name so that I can order it again.

It's a shame that Super Dragon doesn't offer the authentic Chinese menu in English as well."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!! Clean,amazing service and great food. I've loved everything I've tried, but the house chicken and xo string beans are my favorite! I've been several times and have also placed to go orders and have never been disappointed. If you like Chinese food, this place is a must. You are always greeted immediately and drinks are refilled as soon as your empty. They also give you free hot green tea. Can't say enough about how much I love this place!"}
{"text":"Are you SERIOUS ?!?

I'm stunned at how many people actually like this dive. I've eaten Chinese food all over the city (and all over the world) and this place consistently ranks among the worst. Mongolian Beef? Try Mongolian Mystery Meat. All of the supposedly beef menu items that I've tried have been tough and stringy, I dread to think what kind of meat it really is. 

The spring rolls have the texture of  dried cardboard. Moist cardboard would be an improvement.    

My sister loves this place for some unknown reason and as a result I'm often dragged here for birthdays, anniversaries and other celebrations. After 8 visits, I've started eating before I go to this restaurant and when I arrive I'll have a beer and nibble on whatever looks sort of safe.   

I'm willing to concede that it's just me. Perhaps I'm a snob and I'm the only one who's bothered that the pan fried dumplings are soggy and the place just doesn't seem to be that clean.  After all, it's fairly packed when ever I've been there. Lots of Chinese customers... that's supposed to indicate good food, right? 

Despite the audience of loyal followers, I'm not even remotely impressed. And don't get me wrong, I'm not going here expecting Pei Wei of PF Changs, I'm looking for authentic Chinese, sans Jogging Cow. My advice: Look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Saw this place on my way home from work tried it once and really enjoyed there food. I have been here several times already. Will keeping coming back to try the entire menu. They serve great quality food."}
{"text":"Like another reviewer, I had lived in the Bay Area for years, and have fairly extensive experience with Asian food. This was incredibly greasy, and the flavors were drowned out by the oil. I had the appetizer platter as a meal (shared with my companion), preceded by \"hot-and-sour\" soup, which was neither. The \"spring rolls\" were what I call egg rolls and the filling was greasy - it was as if they were fried at too low a temperature, allowing the oil to be absorbed into the food before it finished cooking. The paper-wrapped (well, foil-wrapped) chicken was of a strange consistency - it was almost fluffy, like ground meat bound with egg and poached. The crab puffs were oily and their filling was a sticky paste, albeit flavorful. The tempura shrimp (when did tempura become Chinese?) were oil-soaked, like the spring rolls. The beef ribs were very gristly, and the beef skewers were OK - probably the best item on there. My fellow diner had the orange chicken, which had good flavor, but the consistency of the orange-peel bits in the dish was really hard - I chewed some for the flavor but decided I didn't care to swallow them, any more than I would deliberately swallow olive pits. Only white rice was offered with the orange chicken. We stuck to water and hot tea to drink, and the tea was good - plus it helped cut the oil and get the greasy taste out of my mouth. The service was fine, it was a Tuesday evening and not too busy; the cost was fair for the amount, if not the quality, of the food. I am a big fan of chow fun, and several other reviewers mentioned that theirs is good, so I might go back to try that, but since it has taken me six years to get there this first time (since I moved back to Phoenix) it may take a while."}
{"text":"One word: consistent . 
That is for both food and service. There are other Chinese restaurants with good food, but none with service that can complete with Super Dragon.
We have been going there for over 20 years, and this review is 20 years overdue."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed!

My wife and I have been visiting Super Dragon for our chinese fix since we lived a few miles down the road and decided to check them out.  Though we've moved to a few other neighborhoods in town, we find ourselves making the drive back to 12th and Northern when we are in the mood for good chinese.

The service is always prompt and friendly, even if they are busy.  The quality of the food is consistent.  I often order the house chicken, which has become a favorite of mine, but we're always happy to try new things on the menu and have not been let down.  

My only gripe is that they aren't open for lunch on Saturdays, but that's not annoying enough to cost them a star."}
{"text":"Food, service, ambience -- all just okay -- not great, not terrible.  The reason I give this place a 1 star is due to a large cockroach scurrying across the dining room floor and the waitress non-chalantly scooping it up with her hand, disposing of it, then walking over to a table to fill some water glasses.  Did not even wash her hands.  That's it.  We're not coming back."}
{"text":"Decent food, but bad service. Our waitress must have had an egg roll up her butt or something that was distracting her. In all my years of dining I don't think I've ever had a server come to the table, ask only one of the two people sitting there what they wanted to drink, then walk away. Seriously - she got my friend's drink order and walked away! WTF? But then, get this, she did it again, when she came back with my friend's drink and asked if we were ready to order, I ordered my drink, and then she turned to my friend, got her order, and then turned to walk away. I stopped her this time, of course. Oh, and then later, she took my glass to get me a refill, and when she didn't come back for ten minutes, I started looking around for her, and there she was, wandering around the restaurant with it, no idea which table it was from.. The food was decent, like I said, nothing special, but edible, but with that kind of service, I ain't going back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here on and off for several years.  It may be one of the best places for Chinese food in the Phoenix metro area. The seafood (I've tried several shrimp or scallop dishes) is always super-fresh, and large.  The vegetables are always fresh and never mushy or overcooked; always a bit \"al dente\" the way I like them.   The pan-fried dumplings, shrimp with broccoli, and almond chicken were just perfect when we ordered delivery last week through DoorDash.   Service has always been good when we've eaten in house.  

I don't understand the recent \"greasy\" comment at all.  Nothing has ever been greasy; quite the contrary.  The food has consistently been less greasy than most other Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times but this time was extraordinary for some reason. The service was impeccable! The timing of bringing the food was perfect. We had the crab puffs. I never eat crab but this was great! I had the sweet and sour chicken with brown rice. There was enough for two more meals after we took it home. My husband got something with rice, chicken, pork and shrimp combined.

I have never reviewed the water before but honestly, it reminded me of the water we used to get right from the spring. I would pay for their water it was so good but it's FREE.

This is a great place if you want to have a conversation with someone, it's quiet.

NOTE: stellar report from the health department (does anything else matter???)"}
{"text":"Always fast service and great food. We've been eating here for years and often tale friends. Highly recommended for a consistently great meal."}
{"text":"I was traveling from Tucson to Phoenix for training and staying at the Best Western Plus about a mile away. The hotel had advertised this restaurant,  the reviews were great and I decided to go there. I went there wanting to just take my food and eat it at the hotel room where I could get comfortable but I can honestly say I took longer deciding what to order than it took for them to actually hand it off to me  which makes me question the integrity of how they make their food since I ordered the beef crunchy noodle. The customer service was horrible, no eye contact, no courtesy when speaking directly to the customer, and I know they had the potential for it because there was a woman sitting besides me which she was greeted by a warm,  loud hello followed with laughter and a full blown conversation while I was just handed my food followed by a hurried \"bye\". I get to the hotel and guess what? There was no fork included with my order but luckily the hotel provided me with one.  Hoping that the food was going to be as stellar as everyone had posted and have my troubles compensated by the taste of this food... I can say I was sorely disappointed.  The beef was chewy,  it tasted overcooked, it was just disguising eating it that I just ended up throwing the food away.  It was a waste of time,  gas,  and of $10.29 out of my account but lesson learned. The fortune cookie was tasty though :)"}
{"text":"Yes, I remember the Chinese food of my childhood.
It was the \"best of the best\".
No, I don't expect to ever encounter it again.
Super Dragon comes close.
The service is great.
Things have a tendency to come out of the kitchen too fast.
So, give your server, your order in stages.
Prices are very reasonable.

If you're a Tightwad ... you'll be able to relax here !"}
{"text":"A friend recommend this place. I got take out with he and his wife once. And take out for me and my daughter another time. Easy to talk to over the phone, great customer service - very nice, prices are alright, And portion sizes are big. The place is a little outdated, but clean and well maintained. -the Lemon Chicken, and Walnut Prawns are delicious!"}
{"text":"Good little neighborhood restaurant, we frequent it often for takeout and eat there every Christmas with my Jewish family. A Sunnyslope treasure!"}
{"text":"I think Super Dragon has some of the best American Chinese food in Phoenix. I have been going here for a while and it always tastes great. 
 The building is a little old but they do try to give it a more classy feel at night with tablecloths and linen napkins. 
 If you go here you will most likely enjoy any dish you pick."}
{"text":"This place was excellent. Friendly staff and a really nice environment. We'll be going here again!"}
{"text":"Chinese food is by far my favorite cuisine and I have traveled around the world trying dishes.  I'm giving this a five star purely for the house special crispy pan fried noodles with seafood.  They are very generous with their portions with fairly large shrimp, fish, calamari, and best of all a couple pieces of jumbo scallops.  If you are a seafood lover  this is a must get.  The sauce is incredible in its flavor and compliments the crispy noodles.  My 10 yr old daughter is not a fan of seafood, but she loves the sauce  with the noodles.  I've tried several other entres in my numerous visits, and they are consistently very good especially for its location considering it not near any of the little asias in Phoenix.

Like others have noted,   service is very fast and very friendly and consistent.
Pricing is a good value.

Again,  Crispy pan fried noodles is to die for an excellent choice for $12.00"}
{"text":"As many of you know, it ain't easy getting good Chinese food in Phoenix.  Super Dragon is really one of the only places that does it right for my taste.  The employees are very friendly and provide excellent service.  The food is always good, and it comes out fast.  I haven't ordered take-out from them, but I have some friends who have and they say it's quick and efficient.  They have a pretty good list for their inexpensive lunch menu.  The dinner offerings are more extensive, and offer a good selection--especially if you like family-style dining."}
{"text":"If you want real Chinese food, ask for the Chinese Chinese menu.
Otherwise, you will have your typical American Chinese menu. 
We went there twice we thought it was good. We would recommend the 
dry scallop, egg white fried rice, it's exceptional!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The service is great and the food is delicious. Great place for the entire family!! Looking forward to eating our leftovers! If you're looking for great Chinese food l recommend Super Dragon!!"}
{"text":"Too bad that my first review on Yelp is a negative one :( . I went to Super Dragon today. I ordered Kung Poa chicken, and I could not eat it. The chicken tasted really really bad, as if they re heated it (the taste of left over chicken), also the rice comes on the side in a pot that you scoop from and it will go to other guests after you finish. well who knows if the guest before you did scoop properly with out making a mess, without coughing, sneezing or even laughing over the rice pot while scooping? I was totally unsatisfied."}
{"text":"This is a 2ish-to-3ish-back-to-2ish star kind of joint. Doesn't get more Americanized Chinese than this - your sweet & sour chicken, your Mongolian beef, your walnut prawns....and you realize you're the only one in a packed restaurant at lunchtime actually eating with chopsticks (given upon request). The few times been here for lunch the food has been nominal. Decent but nothing that stayed with me, except that typical post Chinese-lunch craving for a massive nap. 

Service...well, depends on the server. Some are friendly, some not so much. Prices for the lunch special hover around $5.50 and include egg flower or hot & sour soup, entree, fried rice, and the greasiest egg roll that ever egg rolled. 

Chinatown this isn't, but Grandma Ethel would love it. Actually make that plural Grandma Ethels. They were all over, rockin the place."}
{"text":"Based on reviews I figured this place would be awesome. Unfortunately both meals we ordered were barely edible. We got the beef chow fun with sauce and crispy duck. Based on both of these I will never go back. The chow fun sauce was slimy as were the mushrooms and other veggies in it. The crispy duck was mostly fat and lacked flavor. It came with a side of hoisin sauce which did nothing for it and tastes awful as a dip. So we pretty much ate expensive rice."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from this place last night and I was very happy with the service. They said the food would be ready 10 minutes from the time we ordered it and it was there waiting for us (and piping hot) when we walked in barely 10 minutes later. The staff was friendly and efficient. We ordered the pu pu platter for two, orange chicken, orange beef, and kung pao shrimp. It turned out to be two huge bags of food - definitely worth the money. All of it was delicious, though we ordered the kung pao shrimp to be hot/spicy and it wasn't. The only things I wasn't crazy about were the ribs and this weird bread thing that came in tin foil in the pu pu platter. The ribs were very sinewy and fatty and the weird bread slash fish slash cheese triangle (no clue on earth what was in there) was rubbery. I'll definitely come back to try more of their menu, but I probably won't order the pu pu platter again."}
{"text":"Food was very good.  We were seated at 9:00 . They started vacuuming  by 9:30 and putting up chairs on tables.  
ON A FRIDAY NIGHT REALLY.
So rude , why even seat us if we didn't  have time to eat.
Then they hovered the table to take plates.
 I SUGGEST  YOU ORDER TO GO."}
{"text":"Wanted to bump them up a star since the wonton soup and fried rice are not really bad and the nice lady who took my order on the phone remembered me.

However the soup's broth was basically plain chicken stock, and needed soy sauce and pepper to make it tasty.  The fried rice had a good amount of seasoning and meat, but it was extremely greasy/oily.  I've never had fried rice with this much oil!  A copious amount coated the interior of the white takeout container as I moved the rice into a plastic storage container.

The pricier version of the soup, the wor wonton, is even less desirable...bland, overcooked veggies and meat, sadly."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. Some of the best cantonese (pan fried) noodles I've had since San Francisco, & when I ask to add snow-peas they provide ample, so worth the extra $2 for my special request. House comes with shrimp & scallops, as well as large pieces of fish, squid, chicken, pork... the pork fried rice is really nice (think american chinese food fried rice) with some veggies & egg mixed in, just enough, but especially appreciate the added touch of bean sprouts throughout. Their cantonese duck is so wonderful I've not tried their peking duck, nor crispy, but am sure it'd be just as meaty. Yes meaty, duck! The meatiest duck I've ever had, & just as great a flavor as those from china-town windows. 

The service varies from excellent to uncomfortable. Some nights warm & welcoming, fast & courteous, helpful with suggestions, another visit, later on Saturday night - not so much. They are open until 9:45; if you come in at 9, they'll seat & serve you, but unlike previous visits where the server explained & even provided recommendations, the server seemed flippant & & snotty when we tried to discern which duck we always got. Thank gods we figured it out on our own!  They always bring your food fairly fast, although if you ask for the white rice ahead of time they look at you like you're going to take off & ditch them after eating it, & they didn't bring it in a nice container (you know the ones with the lid with the little cut out for the serving spoon) like they usually do, but in a cold bowl, & the rice was - cold!  As was the hot tea - not cold like iced tea, just like tepid, not even luke warm, just like it had been sitting out for hours, & they resented bringing hot - all this at 9 o clock. Also they will start 'cleaning' and by 9:30 will make you very uncomfortable, even seeming resentful to bring you boxes to bring home your recently presented steamy hot food. 

The ambiance is run down, but not dirty, nor in disrepair. The booths are comfortable, the tables solid, and they replace the cloths with fresh.It's a family friendly, dark but not dingy atmosphere, and if you come early & get the \"A team\" you will have a stellar experience. Either way you WILL LOVE the FOOD!

Oh yeah, except the fried pork rice we always get & love was really super salty that night we came \"late\". Other than that the food has always been great."}
{"text":"Togo order:

Crab puffs were all puff and no filling. (very dry)

Moo Shu Vegetable was good, nothing special.

Mongolian Beef was good as well...again nothing special.

Pan fried string beans in garlic sauce were bland.

Nothing was \"bad\" but for the price and flavor, I'd much rather go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We enjoyed everything we had for dinner. Started with the Wor Won Ton soup which was full of large shrimp, chicken and vegetables as well as the won tons. Perfect for the chilly night. Then we shared beef fried rice and the honey walnut prawns. Both were delicious.  Huge prawns. The only complaint is most places serve the prawn dish with some sort of steamed vegetable; usually broccoli. 
Service is friendly and portions are generous.  Parking lot can be difficult to get in and out of during rush hour.   Glad they do not cook with MSG so worth the drive."}
{"text":"Super Dragon is the bomb!  This is our go to for chinese food take out.  The menu is large and there are options for everyone.  We love this place."}
{"text":"It is  the best Chinese restaurant I've ever been to.period. You must try it. It's the best"}
{"text":"The best in AZ! Great staff, never a turn around! They remember you! And they have the best crab puffs with cream cheese and my favorite, although I've tried several and NEVER a bad meal is: House Chicken, little but spicy but perfect breast chicken. Hard to find that in Asian places. All my love, all my referrals! Wonton Lady!"}
{"text":"The taste is ok. But every time i order from here my food comes half cold and warm. Like it must be left over under a heatlight then they dish it out.. it's pretty gross"}
{"text":"Super Dragon phoenix

First I have to complement one of the best waitress is ever her name is Irene boss is tough but it's really well run restaurant but the food is exceptional clearly  for American Chinese

The cold but us cup minced chicken is a must so is that shrimp chow fun

{"text":"Very impressive! The building looks like you should just drive by but it's totally worth checking out. We ordered the pan seared wontons and they done very well. The outside had a perfect light crisp with a soft wrapper; great texture. We got the Black Bean Cod and Half Crispy Duck. The cod was cooked nice and soft and was not too salty, like most make the dish. The duck was fantastic. It costs a buck or two more but you can see why it's worth the price. The meat quality and the cook time are top notch. This is not a standard delivery Chinese food, this place brings quality."}
{"text":"Been going to Super Dragon for eons now.  Anyone who says the food is average or just ok.  Is not a Chinese food connoisseur, for sure.  Everything is great from the pu pu platter to the 
beef and broccoli and everyone's favorite sweet 'n sour pork.  The egg rolls, regular and vegan and the crab puffs are really good.  Always get hot tea and fortune cookies too.  But what makes this place so good and the food taste even better is the service.  Second to none. The owner is there to seat you and make sure you are taken care of.  She is so cute, and her
accent is just even cuter.  She's fun to talk to.  The rest of the staff is just as friendly and attentive.  Always a nice experience.  When getting take out.  I usually enjoy a beer from the bar while I wait.  There's always someone else coming in for a take out order to talk to while you're waiting.  Just a great place with great food.  I would highly recommend them to everyone who likes chinese food!  If you're not in China, you can go here!"}
{"text":"I've been going exclusively to Super Dragon for nearly 15 years. After eating at a few other nearby Chinese food restaurants many years ago, I'm reluctant to try anywhere else. The food is consistently good, the prices are reasonable and, most importantly, the staff and service are exceptional."}
{"text":"I still haven't found my West side Chinese, and now, Silver Dragon is closed. So we pressed further Eastward in search of good Chinese food, and gave Super Dragon a try.

Contrary to Bobby Q.s' experience, I actually had really good service, and mediocre / decent food. We found the staff very friendly and attentive. The food came out in a timely manner, and our glasses were often filled.

We ordered BBQ pork lo mein and the House's chicken. The texture of the lo mein noodles were just right -- almost al dente. But the sauce was way too salty. 

The House's chicken was basically fried chicken breast, with a vaguely Chinese-spiced brown gravy on top. The menu claimed the sauce was spicy and garlicky. It was neither. 

I do like that they serve passion fruit China Mist iced tea there. I probably drank a gallon of it during the course of the meal. Though, that might've had something to do with that salty lo mein too. 

I am not ready to give up on Super Dragon yet . I would like to go back some day and try that duck. Plus, it is the best, Western-most Chinese restaurant I have found so far."}
{"text":"The staff were super friendly to me. But the food I ordered was just plain not good. I got the sesame beef and it was like no other sesame beef I've ever gotten. Instead of being in a sweet honey type sauce it's in a tomato type sauce like spices up ketchup and it was just weird. The crab puffs were okay.  But the fried rice had no flavor and was incredibly dry. I'm not sure if there's anything that could make me come back here. I felt like I wasted my money."}
{"text":"This is an odd restaurant to review. We've been coming here for over 20 years. The food is really very tasty. One of my favorites in phoenix. The service is always great and they give you just what you want.  There is a tall slender gentleman who is the greatest waiter and very accommodating. The problem is the owner. We have been coming forever and not EVEN ONCE has she said hello or goodbye. She is always short and on the rude side. No smile. Nothing. Sometimes we are unaffected by her but other times she is so rude and annoying we vow not to come back....but then, ,like masochistic Capastrano swallows ,we return because we adore the food. ;) We do come far less than we would normally for such good food. We come about 4-6 times a year. I wonder if she realizes that a friendly gesture or a smile would have us there far more often. I have a friend who is visually impaired and she refuses to go with us because she says the owner gets very resentful when she brings in her service dog. She always acts like she cant wait for the customers to eat and get the hell out quick. Whatever you do dont go for a late dinner because they start vacuuming 45 min before closing and you will eat your Dim Sum to the humming of a Hoover. Anyway food is what counts and it's really very good so 5 stars for the food and 1 star for the socially inept owner."}
{"text":"Hit or miss.  Sometimes their food is cooked well..other times its over cooked.  I've had rubbery overcooked shrimp the last few times I've been here.  Not cool.  When its good, its good.  Just wish it was consistent."}
{"text":"Rude af. I can't eat at a place that's so rude I won't eat anywhere like that so I just left the way they spoke to people on the phone and then to me trying to force me to sit down in a chair just annoying I didn't even order I just left"}
{"text":"Everything here is fantastic! We ordered the cashew chicken, spring rolls, sweet and sour shrimp, and lemon chicken, all fantastic!"}
{"text":"Went for Christmas and were disappointed. The leftover Szechuan fish filet is in the picture on its way to the trash. No flavor no peppers at all and we asked for spicy. The mu shu pork was 90% vegetables and again tasteless. Panda Express would have been better. Never again."}
{"text":"Super Dragon is our favorite Chinese place. The food is always delicious and the service is excellent! They make a salty fish and chicken fried rice that you pretty much can't get anywhere else that's this amazing!! It's worth the drive for us every time!!! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food.. Good service been around for at least 20 yrs family owned I think.. place is a keeper. Try it out.. 
Beef kinda crispy 
moo goo gai pan good
Beef teriyaki good"}
{"text":"Not only was the food good the service was awesome. I played a game with a waitress to see how long I can have my water glass empty and I lost."}
{"text":"Good place overall.

The sesame beef (see picture) had nice texture and the sauce had a tangy kick to it.  The pork friend rice was excellent overall, they use the cubes of red pork instead of the nondescript strips.  Overall quality was a step above the average Chinese take out."}
{"text":"Husband and I went tonight. Customer service is pretty good, but the food wasn't. We ordered PuPu appetizer and the meat items tasted old or like they were reheated. Food was definitely hot, temperature wise. Water doesn't taste very good. Husband got the shrimp egg fu young, came with a very dark sauce, not gravy like he's accustomed to. He didn't like it and ended up asking for orange chicken instead which he said was ok. I had kung pao chicken. Not enough veggies or peanuts (which seemed kind of stale). They were kind of stingy with the steamed rice too. Chicken in both dishes, for me, was stringy chewy. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Decided to give them another try. Ordered their chicken corn soup . It was a little too salty and too much eggs. We had their pot stickers . The we're cooked properly but they were small and the meat did not have much h flavor.  Their roast duck was nice and crunchy . Maybe a little over cooked.  Our favorite honey walnut shrimp were small and overcooked . We had the salt and pepper  pork chops . These were undercooked."}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood Chinese Restaurant and a family staple.  I personaly like the roasted / peking duck.  The Shrimp Lo-Mein is good, Fast, Friendly Service, No MSG.
Lunch Specials  during the week are awesome too."}
{"text":"It was OK overall. Service was phenomenal. No qualms there.

I just wasn't that big of a fan of the food. The only thing I really liked was the Pu Pu Platter (which was really good). Everything else was just \"Meh.\"

I would like to give them a higher review based on their exceptional service, but the food just was not there..."}
{"text":"Hot and delicious every time. Owner is very nice and remembers everything you like. Great service and excellent food. What more you want."}
{"text":"This place is great. I'm Chinese and I'm very picky about my food. When I want take out, I come here. Granted, I cheat a little because I order things that are not on the menu sometimes but I've never been unhappy eating in or taking out. I even brought my parents and they liked it. It's close and authentic. The staff is friendly, the food is consistent.  It is lacking in atmosphere but I'll give that up for consistently good food.  If you order sweet and sour pork, orange chicken, or similarly Americanized dishes, read a different review. I've never ordered those kinds of dishes here so I can't speak for them."}
{"text":"Love this place, but my wife loves it more. Great authentic food, many options to choose from. The service is exemplary. Take out or dine in."}
{"text":"Haven't ate here in years due to location but decided to have hubby pick this up for dinner last night.

Mu shu pork- amazing!

crab Rangoon's- Amazing

Chix and broccoli- pretty good broccoli a little mushy

Really enjoyed dinner! check it out for some good eats"}
{"text":"We have tried a lot of Chinese restaurants in town and this is our favorite. Service is super fast and friendly and the selection is decent. The food is good and consistent. My personal favorite is the pork fried rice and the house chicken and my husband goes for the hot and sour soup.

The place could use a remodel but it is not in such bad shape yet that it completely tuns me off."}
{"text":"My friend told me to eat here back in 2008 and I did and it was amazing!!! Last night I went back with my family and the food is still as superb as it was 10 years ago. I had the scallops and shrimp and was not let down, do yourself a favor and eat here."}
{"text":"Pretty solid chinese food. We had sweet and sour pork and mongolian beef lunch special.  They were both pretty solid, I liked that the sweet and sour pork had a lot of pineapple chunks and not drowning in sauce.  The Mongolian beef was almost too salty but just almost.  Good flavor for both.  I'd definitely try this place again for some actual Chinese dishes."}
{"text":"Love this place ! Been coming here for at least 20 years . Love  the honey walnut shrimp , spicy eggplant, house chicken .
Love everything ! Fresh, big portions ,
Nice wait staff !"}
{"text":"I love this little place. Old school Chinese food. Some of my favorites are the chicken lo mien and the fried rice. Today I discovered the garlic long beans- they are the best I've ever had in any cuisine"}
{"text":"We had sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken , shrimp tempura, hot and sour soup. Amazing service literally my cup was never less than half full. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The owner is a she w/ bomb hairdo and she was extremely rude and did not let us finish our sentences even once. Aggressive to no end. Stiff face not even a slight smile throughout our time over there!

To be fair, the service people in the restaurant were nice and helpful.

Will we return? NO."}
{"text":"I don't do sit down chinese food very much, but would highly recommend this one.  The service was excellent.  The food was very good.  Had fried dumplings (great), spring rolls (best i've had in a long while) and orange chicken.  My husband, child and I got out of there full, with leftovers, for about $25."}
{"text":"Took my wife here on a friends recommendation. Waitress very friendly , services was quick . I ordered the Chilli sea bass, I mistook it for chillean sea bass . Anyway it didn't taste fresh and was very bland and very fishy ,egg drop soup had a very slimy texture actually had to spit them both out on plate. lost my appetite at this point and asked waitress it she could take this off the bill as I did want anything else . She said she didn't think so and would check with owner . She returned and said owner said no but I could replace it with something else. I really didn't want anything else but settled for the leomon  chicken . Chilli Sea Bass was about $ 24 egg drop soup about $5 and Leomon Chicken about $13 , couldn't  get adjustment on bill and we did leave a tip. Needless to say we wont be back here again or recommend to anyone even though Leomon chicken was okay the next day."}
{"text":"A bit upset, Super Dragon ruined it for me about a year ago. After my bf introduced me to this place I can no longer eat shrimp fried rice anywhere else in the valley, compared to SD, everything else is simply gross

LOVE SUPER DRAGON AND THE WORKERS"}
{"text":"Mongolian beef is the best we've ever had!! Tender beef and crisp onions in delightful brown sauce. Delicious fried rice and egg rolls are to live for!!! Our new go to for delicious Chinese cuisine!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was 5 years old, as I would come to eat for my birthday dinner. After 12 years things have not changed a bit. The food continues to be excellent every single time. Kim, the lady at the front desk, has remembered my name after all these years, even if I haven't been in for over a year! Yes the exterior of the place is falling apart, but the food and good service makes up for it completely. I have been and will also continue to eat at Super Dragon, and would recommend it to you as well."}
{"text":"Great food, best lettuce wraps ever! The staff is friendly and to go orders are hot and ready when they say. Love this place."}
{"text":"Christmas dinner success!! We called in our order of 8 dishes for a large group early in the day and it was ready exactly when we were told it would be. While we've been to Super Dragon several times before (and really enjoyed it), it's crazy busy days like Xmas where we are really reminded about good quality and service...and they've got it here! Don't forget to add the eggplant dish to your order - it's SO delicious!"}
{"text":"We  have been going here for years! Always a smile when u walk in super fast service and great food!! If u have not tried this place you really need to."}
{"text":"Tasty but way too much grease!

Every now and then, I get the hankering for some good Chinese food just like most people on this planet.

I ordered a takeout shrimp lomein, the soft pan fried noodles. Ok, ok, I know it's pan fried, but as I dish out my noodles onto a plate, the noodles were literally dripping in grease. I ended up not finishing my food and throwing them away. I could fry an egg or two from the grease that was dripping from my noodles as I plated them. 

In terms of taste, the food was pretty tasty. But, I couldn't take another bite from too much grease. Woke up the next morning with an upset stomach from the grease. 

Never again! I think I'm going back to green juicing again."}
{"text":"Great food. Clean and quick. Great Prices. The only thing we did not like was the Egg Foo Young. Mu Shu Grill at 15th ave and Thomas still has the best Egg Foo Young. But we loved everything else here."}
{"text":"Not what I was expecting


Super Dragon has  a nice menu selection . On my first visit to Super Dragon for appetizers we ordered fried dumplings  and spring rolls. We liked the appetizers they were  hot and flavorful. Our main dishes were just average, I ordered the house chicken  and my lunch companion  had the chicken lo mein. The food was served hot but seemed a little bland. The entrées just didn't have a lot of flavor.  I was really disappointed. The meal just wasn't what I was expecting.

 I want to end this review on a positive note.  So lets talk about the customer service at Super Dragon. The service at Super Dragon is great.  The servers made sure our drinks were always full and ensured we had everything we needed or wanted."}
{"text":"I was craving some good Chinese food and searched for a place near our location. Most Reviews said this was a great place, and it was crowded. Then the bad news. Food had zero flavor, so horribly disappointed. Our meal came out over a 10 minute period. Dish #1, 3-4 minutes later our fried rice, 5-7 minutes later Dish #2. 
The waitress and staff were very nice."}
{"text":"Reminds me of the old joint I use to go to as a child. Really friendly service and I love how my waitress understood that it was my first time so she took the time to know what I like and gave me her best recommendations, I had the Melion Beef (I think that's how you spell it) and it was amazing! Love the white rice that comes in separate bowl so you can  add rice as you like! I also got a order of Crab Puffs as my appetizer and they were nice and crunchy but not to the point where it's like biting into a rock yuh know! Overall very amazing! Will definitely bring my family back!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Even though they are a little pricey they are well worth it.  The staff is also very sweet! Get the sweet and sour chicken and the pork fried rice!"}
{"text":"After reading mostly good reviews, we figured Super Dragon would be a good fit for our Asian American family of two adults and two kids. We weren't disappointed. We called an hour earlier to see if we needed a reservation, but were assured it wouldn't be a problem. We arrived for Sunday lunch at 12:30 and were given a table right away. While we decided what to order we were given ice water and hot green tea. We ordered 3 entrees for the four of us and everything came to the table in less than 10 minutes. The food was fresh, well prepared and tasted very good. Even so, it was too much food for us and we had to take around a third of it home. Total came to around $40 including tip. Definitely good value and we'll go back there again. It's true it could do with some renovation work, but the food was very good, so we didn't care about the decor."}
{"text":"Tasty dishes - I had panfried noodles/shrimp, had vegetables; my husband had orange shrimp, had broccoli, not too spicy. But service was indifferent and menu didn't explain what was in each dish."}
{"text":"This is a good solid Chinese takeout place. I used door dash to order delivery. The food came hot and well packaged. We had the beef with broccoli, lo mein, General Tso's chicken, crab puffs, chicken lettuce cups, and dumplings. All of them were good and not too salty. The left overs were good for a couple more meals too."}
{"text":"I stop by a couple times a month for  wor wonton Soup, Love their Soup"}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat in Phoenix. Great service make the experience even better."}
{"text":"This used to be our regular payday Friday lunch spot, so I have a lot of experience with the lunch menu and the service. However, that was when one of our lunch crew was a guy who wouldn't venture out of a 5-mile radius for lunch and was a pretty simple eater. That guy has moved on and our options for lunch have expanded, so it had been a while... today, a few of us decided to pay our respects. 

Super Dragon is consistent. It was simple food, reasonable lunch special pricing, fairly quick to get in and out and they're willing to split your check at the register. 

We've had really good experience with service (although, sometimes we feel rushed when we're paying). Our glasses are always full and food orders are delivered quickly. 

I must confess, Chinese food is not my favorite... so that probably contributes to me only being able to give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"This is a true treasure in my neighborhood and some of the best Chinese food I have ever had!  They have a great dinner combo we normally order, consisting of Mongolian beef, house chicken in garlic sauce, and pork fried rice which comes with soup, a shrimp, a crab puff, and an egg roll.  They also have complimentary hot tea.  The portions are huge and we always have enough left over for 1-2 more meals.  We tried the Cantonese pan fried noodles with chicken and kung poa vegetables, and both were phenomenal.  I am warning you now, the pan fried noodles are highly addictive, I couldn't stop eating them and became overly stuffed.  
The service is excellent, they bring water out immediately and are always on top of refilling your drink and clearing dirty plates.  The inside appears clean and the table cloths are changed after each customer.  The menu is massive with so many choices of beef, chicken, pork, seafood, and vegetarian dishes.  If I were to move away from this place, I would definitely be back often...it is so hard to find great Chinese food and this place is definitely top notch!"}
{"text":"if you REALLY want good Chinese food here, bring someone who can read/speak Chinese and order off the menu. We usually order from the family meals. I don't really know what to ask for, since my mom does all of our ordering, and my Cantonese is atrocious. However, the staff here is really SO nice and helpful. I do know we usually get a dish with bokchoy and mushrooms, and a tofu/mushroom dish (SO GOOD!!!!), sweet and sour pork, and not sure what else.

And the food? You see those 4 stars, right? I prefer the food here to many other Chinese options in the vicinity. Service is fast, the bathroom is pretty clean, the food is tasty. the prices are quite reasonable as well.

For a la carte options, I recommend the Singapore noodles (thin rice noodles stir fried with seafood and bbq pork, all in a delicious dry-not saucy yellow curry sauce) or any of the chow funs (flat wide rice noodles stir fried w a variety of meats/veggies). 

And if you like to be stuck in your little \"Panda Express is my favorite Chinese food\" world, they do offer Americanized \"Chinese\" food too."}
{"text":"Bad food, rude people, and expensive. Bought mongolian beef and the pieces of beef where too big and hard, had to throw it out. Also ordered their house chicken and it was bland. $30 down the drain."}
{"text":"Be sure to order the authentic Chinese food here. Meaning not the sweet and sour chicken or lo mein or something! The place seems pretty busy and the staff is pretty quick on their feet.

We ordered a bunch of food that I don't even know the name of in English. We just know the names in Chinese and from the Chinese menu. We can give it generic names like roast duck, roast pork belly, beef stew, Chinese broccoli, walnut shrimp, etc. It was good and authentic. Price is not bad. If you know how to do it right, you can come here with a group of people, order an authentic family style meal for a reasonable price.

A good way to test it is if it's not on the Panda Express menu, it's probably authentic. Although I love PE's beef and broccoli. I don't know why but I love it."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner and excellent service.  Mu shu veggie was delightful as was the orange chicken and fried rice.  My daughter is 9 and was treated like royalty.  Great local place as well. We found this place on yelp"}
{"text":"I have been going to SuperDragon since I moved to Phoenix in 2000.  Kam is great.  Her team is very hard working and efficient.   But the bottom line is the food is delicious and I definitely recommend you try them for yourself.  Their Chinese veggies are excellent and they also have wonderful lunch specials.  Good value.  If you want to know where the Asians go for Chinese food.  This is it!"}
{"text":"This is our family's go-to local Chinese joint, a favorite for my step mom and my father. We really enjoy the salt and pepper pork chops and also the salt and pepper shrimp. Young chow fried rice Pan fried noodle w/seafood. A few other dishes we like are the whole fish and the Crunch grilled seabass. X.O. green beans, Chinese broccoli, and the sizzling Hong Kong style steak or black pepper and beef are delicious."}
{"text":"This is my all-time favorite Chinese place. Service is always quick and fantastic. I have dreams about their Mongolian beef at least once every couple of weeks. To die for. Other fantastic dishes are the lo mein, shrimp with lobster sauce, and the crispy duck. So so good."}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Chinese spot that makes their sweet n sour chicken like this since South China back in the day! Most places just pour the sauce on top.. I like how they cook it together! With onion green/red bell peppers and pineapple !!  Best spot for sweet n sour chicken in my book! And I'm VERY.. NO. EXTREMELY picky! lol only con is I think they're a lil pricey. This was a lunch special and it cost me $8 for a portion size that's not very much. At least it's good!"}
{"text":"Great Chinese cuisine. Best I've had in area. Good portions too.  individual soups are pretty tasty too. Good prices and very courteous staff."}
{"text":"Great food, great price, very awesome lunch specials.  I would have given 5 stars but the service is normally a bit fast and some of the wait staff are a bit pushy!!  All in all, great value."}
{"text":"Very standard/typical Chinese fare.  I took Christina D.'s reco on the Walnut Prawns and was the belle of my table by recommending them!  They disappeared completely, vs. the leftover Mongolian Beef and Cashew Chicken entrees.

The menu has a large selection with options ranging from your favorite staples to combinations you have never heard of.  The service was 5-stars, very attentive and helpful servers.  It probably didn't hurt though that the restaurant was pretty slow when we were there -- which is odd for 7:30pm on a Saturday (made me a bit nervous in fact)!

My biggest complaint was the lack of atmosphere.  I don't expect a lot, but it was pin-drop silent the entire time--no music, no background noise, just quiet.  We could hear conversations at other tables and felt like everyone was listening to us as well.  We were there as a part of a birthday night out for a friend, so it wasn't a good fit for our mood expectations.  May I suggest some overhead music just to get the mood going?  Or takeout....."}
{"text":"Not great but I ate it. I think everything just lacked flavor. Americanized Chinese food for sure, and I'm fine with that but everything needed salt or something, weak in flavor. I tried it but wont be back. I wanted to like  it cause I live close by."}
{"text":"Our hotel recommended Super Dragon as a close eatery. Being Asian from San Francisco I'm leary of chinese offerings but we had a great tasty meal. We enjoyed a cashew chicken and a filet of fish with mixed veggies. Each had a different flavor with different veggies and a great taste.
Service was attentive and friendly. The location is a little dark but the entire area is the same. I would return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Very clean and very quick customer service. Staff was unreal as to making sure you had all your food and drinks taking care of. Very affordable and tons of food. Would come back."}
{"text":"I was here for a large party that my friend was hosting. One of her friends is Chinese so we let him have at it with the ordering. He did not disappoint nor did Super Dragon. 

We started off with West Lake Beef Soup. It is very similar to egg drop soup, but with lots of minced beef, tofu and a lot of cilantro. Delicious! 

For the entrees we had many different things...String beans with white garlic sauce, eggplant with garlic sauce, fried tofu, fried poor chops, crispy chicken, shrimp with walnuts, shrimp and scallops with croquets, Peking duck and West Lake Duck (West Lake Duck was ordered a couple of days in advance). Everything was really good. Shrimp and scallops with croquets and the fried pork chips were my favorites. I am a huge duck fan and this was very good, but they chop the duck here so there are too many bones to deal with. 

The vegetarian entrees were very good as well. The string beans with white garlic sauce and eggplant are two vegetarian items I would order again. 

I really wanted to take lots of photos of the food, but just wasn't comfortable doing so with this large group and as I said, I wasn't hosting. 

The do have a bar. Service was excellent. Clean restrooms!

I will come back here for sure. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. Me personally think this is the best Chinese food in the Phoenix area. The spare ribs are awesome. Pork fried rice is great. It's all good. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Food is over priced and not good at all. I had a takeout order and it was dinner time. The restaurant was empty which was a bad sign but after I got the food home it was greasy and bland. I will not return. China Chili is a great Chinese restaurant and where I will stick to for Chinese food."}
{"text":"The food was excellent the service is top notch and is really worth the drive I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Well shoot. I ran over to this place after a customer of mine went onnn and onnn about this hidden gem. I scoured yelp to find the most raved dish and side and went with the house chicken & crab puffs. First, I need to address the looney tunes Yelper who called the chicken spicy and flavorful and the crab puffs creamy and delicious. You, my dear, must have like three taste buds. The house chicken was blaaaand and the crab puffs were very likely a mess up from the kitchen. There is no way those weren't just fried wantons. Please folks, if you will, picture a pea in your mind. If there was more crab/cream cheese mixture in those wanton wrappers then that pea, then I'm a monkey's uncle- clearly impossible as I'm a chick and human. A less important side note, it was $20 for these two items. Coulda, shoulda, woulda had a filet at work for less. Three stars for good customer service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very authentic (make sure to ask for the Chinese menu)! We have been coming here for years and the dishes have been quite consistent. The service is extremely fast, as the food comes out in less than 10 minutes. Try out the roast duck & braised tofu with mushrooms!"}
{"text":"The ladies who work here are wonderful. They are so friendly. The place is clean and food is good. I'm still looking for the blow your mind cheese food restaurant that I am sure no one knows about in Phoenix. But this place is delicious. I had house lo mein. Last time I went I had Shrimp in Lobster Sauce... it was very good."}
{"text":"Great little Asian restaurant a jewel for sure! Very clean very friendly and the food is just superb. Super Dragon made the Dean's list on the health departments cleanliness report.They earned a five star rating February 2016.
My favorite is the Cantonese pan fried noodles the house version just can't believe it try it! I am sure you like it."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years. \"Standard\" version of Americanized Chinese food which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Good hot and sour soup, orange chicken (they leave the orange peels in) and house special chicken. Great take out spot"}
{"text":"First time here, recommend by a friend. The service was friendly and attentive. The food was delicious. Would like to see some more Szechuan items on the menu."}
{"text":"Good Ol' fashioned Chinese food like you are used to. This place doesn't look too impressive on the outside or even the inside for that matter, however, the food is good and you will get what you expect. The service is fast, friendly and attentive.

A solid pick if you are in the mood for Chinese."}
{"text":"I visited Super Dragon On 05/30/2016 for the first time. I have not been too happy about eating Chinese food lately since i have been disappointed by many places before. But my boyfriend wanted to try it and i was curious to do so as well. 

We wanted to try everything because we were so hungry and because  i wanted to like it so bad. 

For starters We ordered the crab puffs (8) 
we ordered 3 lunch meals:
the Walnut shrimp
the kung-pao chicken 
shrimp lo-mein soft noodle

all orders came with fried rice and an egg drop soup. You can also replace the egg drop soup for a sweet and sour soup for additional $.

The food was good and the service and attention from our server was exceptional!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and prompt, attentive service.   We had the PuPu platter, egg flower soup, beef and. Broccoli, pork lo mien, and orange chicken.  Not much to say other than it was delicious and this is our new north central Phoenix Chinese food spot."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh and perfectly cooked. My Kung Pao chicken could've been spicier, but I'll order it extra spicy next time. The veggies were still crisp, the chicken was juicy and tender, and the sauce was very well done. Husband had the Szechuan pork, and he said it was the best he's ever had. We had the lunch specials that came with egg drop soup and an egg roll. The soup was very flavorful, nicely thickened, and broth based rather than some I've had that are more creamy. Now the egg rolls...since we moved to Phoenix I've been severely missing the crispy egg rolls from our old go to Chinese place in Chicagoland, not anymore. This place nails it. The owner told me they hand roll them from scratch everyday, it shows. They were crispy (think spring rolls), not greasy, with a nice veggie filling. They give you a little cup of sweet and sour with a dollop of hot mustard. They are delicious. Everything came out quickly and piping hot, the staff was very friendly and attentive, the restaurant is very clean, and the prices were beyond reasonable. I'm so happy we found our new Chinese place!"}
{"text":"Not bad place. Lil small restaurant, good customer service, good tasty food n portions are fair. Prices are about $10-$13 ala cart..decided to try it out and its ok, i wish the prices were a lil less but its good n not far from meee. I might come bak if i don't feel like driving to Mesa."}
{"text":"Great food!! Every time I came here I always have something unexpected. The food is nice and hot. Boss lady is super funny and friendly. Sizzling rice soup is the best. Love it!"}
{"text":"This is the best Asian food we ever had. The portions are so generous and delicious. We will be back since there are so many more entrees we want to try. Service was very friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Great food, wonderfully friendly staff! I love the war wonton soup. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Ugh. Ugh ugh ugh. I hate reading reviews where the person just complains and complains, but...this is about to be one of those reviews.

Things must have changed here in the last few years because I remember ordering from here in high school and the food was good. I went here recently with a friend. She ordered sweet and sour chicken and I ordered beef chow mein. The water didn't even taste right...it had a really weird aftertaste and I avoided it after the first sip. My friend's sweet and sour chicken is what awarded this place the 2 stars I gave it, but my chow mein was ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. I can't even say that it was beef I was served (sorry to have to make the usual Chinese restaurant reference, but truly, it did not taste or smell like beef at all). When the waitress came by and saw I had not touched 99% of my food, she asked if everything was okay and if I needed a box. I informed her that I was not happy with the way the meat was cooked, and she said, \"Hmm\" and walked away. Apparently that was a sufficient response, and I didn't hear another word from her afterwards.

There are so, so, so many better places to get Chinese from in Phoenix, even in this neighborhood...just don't come here."}
{"text":"This is my go to for fast take out of excellent Chinese food. Super nice and fast service combined with many tempting dishes. Check this local legend out and you will quickly become a regular. Love it!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for Chinese food. The staff is always friendly and visit the table frequently. We have never had a bad meal there. Wor Wonton soup is the best we've ever had. Lunch specials are a great deal... And more food then you can usually eat. We have been going there for many years... And the staff all knows us. Don't let the exterior of the building fool you... Go on in and have a great meal !!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed with my first visit. The staff and service was nice and friendly but the food didn't live up to my expectations. 

I ordered egg rolls, won ton soup, and the house special chow fun. 

The egg rolls were decent. Nothing bad or exceptional. The won ton soup was a little below average. As noted in someone else's review, the broth is basically chicken stock. Not much depth in flavor. The wontons were a little bit dried out and chewy. I've had much worse, but I've had much better too. 

The big problem was the chow fun. I ordered it wet but I think the noodles were overcooked and soggy. But even worse, the seafood was very overcooked. The pieces of fish, shrimp, and especially scallops were so rubbery. I was not impressed with the freshness of the seafood or the cooking technique. I managed to eat most of it since I was really hungry, but I should have ordered the beef chow fun.  

I don't think I'll go back anytime soon. The Chow Fun at South China Restaurant (now Joe's Diner) on 7th ave blows it away. Even the rather mediocre chow fun at Lucky Dragon on Thomas was better than Super Dragon's version."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a diamond in thr rough...Great roast duck and fried rice, it made me feel like I was back in Manhattan for an upscale chinese meal...
I'll be back again for a visit..."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times in the last few years. The dining room is always immaculately clean and tidy...cloth tablecloths and napkins. Servers and staff are quick and friendly...truly sweet people. The food? I've never had a bad meal...ingredients are always fresh...sauces are always fresh tasting. Fried items are light and crisp. I think Super Dragon is the best choice for Chinese in North Central Phoenix."}
{"text":"My roommate and I live in this part of town, so we decided to eat here this evening. It's definitely a fabulous place to get some Chinese food.  The place has  a great family atmosphere, and the food is delectable. Portions are huge, so you get a good value for money especially the set lunch option. 
If you're not in the mood for going out, they also provide a delivery service. I'm giving them 5 stars because I'm a generous reviewer especially if the service is friendly, courteous, and fast."}
{"text":"Before writing this, I had it all planned out in my head. First sentence: \"I can't believe I actually went here and am admitting it\" but it's obviously a popular spot for yelpers. Crazy.

My mom and dad suckered me into meeting them here and it's kind of awful and agreeably Americanized Chinese food. My parents just love this place and think it's the best Chinese in town*.

Everything tasted totally \"off\"... even the fried rice, which quizzically had none of the ingredients I'm used to it having. The water tasted dirty and I saw 2 NASCAR t-shirts while I was here (these set my \"check engine\" light on immediately).


*This both confuses and comforts me... I can finally put to rest dreams of my parents reverting back to their free-wheeling, adventurous, hippie personality types they once graced this world with. They are now Bush-loving Republicans, and I am... okay with this. Breathe, Norma."}
{"text":"I love Super Dragon and I have been coming here for many many years. This is my mom's favorite restaurant in the valley. Everything is always fresh but if is getting a little dingy. The inside really needs to be renovated and it is starting to feel like stuffy inside.. the carpet must be at least 15 years old, no joke. With all of the new development on the area Super Dragon needs to get with the times before they miss out on new customers. Although I live in the west valley I'm still a regular customer. I love the food but the place needs a face lift. Here are our favorite items to order: House fried rice, Kung pow 2, orange chicken, lemon chicken, sizzling rice and the low mein.. all dishes are made to order(I believe) and always taste fresh!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food ever. There's a reason they have been in business for 19 years. Everyone is exceptional, and all items on the menu are delicious."}
{"text":"I used to live right around the corner from this restaurant, so it was a frequent destination for my wife and myself.  We went to their grand opening way back when. Alas now we live too far away, but we make a special trip to dine or take out when we can. (Sorry Kam!)

My wife and I lived in the SF Bay area for 14 years so we have made our way around a Chinese menu or two. I try to stay away from the obvious Americanized menu items and take suggestions from our server as to what is fresh and special.  I have never been disappointed with their suggestions off the Chinese menu and regular menu. Sometimes you will get lucky and they have fresh mushrooms, clams, crab, whole fish etc...I have a soft spot for anything noodle and their \"dry\" chow fun is one of my favorites.

I have found this place to be one of the better Chinese restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and fast. I tried the orange chicken, kung pao veggies and some crab puffs. Everything was pretty good overall. I think Chinese rest. are the only places that can get away with such old furniture."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Everything was so fresh and delicious! Staff was very friendly, we never went without drinks. Will def be back!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good, real good. The service, no problems there either. The problem is INCONSISTENT HOURS. You can very easily make a trip there to eat and when you arrive you notice a piece of paper taped to the front door saying something like \"Closed July 1-9\" or \"Will re-open Jan 23rd (2.5 weeks away). That's IRRITATING."}
{"text":"Been going to this place since I was a kid, and the lady at the front hasn't aged a day I swear. They have the best House Chicken in town! Make sure to try it out if your around."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding! I've had 'authentic' Chinese a few times since moving to the valley, mostly due to having a Chinese coworker or two that knew where to take us for the good stuff. I have to say, out of all the places I've been, this is probably one of my favorites if not the favorite. 

The atmosphere is great, very laid back and quiet, looks like a hole-in-the-wall from the outside but the inside is pretty nice. Not fancy, but more of a quiet, dimly-lit (but tastefully so!) place to isolate yourself from the rest of the world for just a little while. 

The food on our visit was absolutely excellent. I had a bit of everything, shrimp, tofu and beef and they were all fabulous and the best I've had so far. I literally could not get enough and ate more than my fair share of our family style spread. 

It might be a little out of the way and it doesn't look like much from the outside, but this is a great place. The service was awesome, friendly and very attentive and the food was fantastic. I would definitely go back and hope I can find and excuse to head out that way sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Locally, it's a yummiest Chinese food with good services. Overall, it's always been good experience Either dine in or out. Try most of the typical entrees on the menu...I like it because it's truly a locally owned and I would like to support that. Eggrolls and chicken lettuce wraps are definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Food was very good.best I have had in the valley so far. I am from the NE and this has been the closest thing to there I have been able to find. We had Peking Duck which was prepared perfectly.Service was prompt and it was very reasonably priced"}
{"text":"Recently ordered an embarrassingly large amount of take out from Super Dragon and couldn't be happier.  

When I called it in they surprised me by stating that it'd be ready in ten minutes.  (again, I ordered a LOT of food) So when I skeptically walked in barely 10 minutes later to find it sitting on the counter  - they had me sold.

Both the orange beef and orange chicken were delightful, only note - I recommend ordering them both extra spicy, but that's me.  The kung pao shrimp could have used a few more shrimp, but name a place where that isn't true.

All in all, fantastic take out experience - I will definitely order here again."}
{"text":"One of our favorite Chines restaruants.  We especially love their walnut chicken.   Slightly sweet walnuts, succulent chicken.  Also great sweet sour soup.   Service pretty good."}
{"text":"GREAT service. Glasses were never empty! The best I had was the sesame beef. Little bit of a homely place :)"}
{"text":"Update:   Went here the other night for dinner.  Ordered our usual dishes.  Not one of them was good.  They changed chicken or something, because the 3 chicken dishes we had, were all tough, chewy, rubbery, dark in color and just plain disgusting.  I'm so sorry to say this, because we love this place and the people are awesome, but if they are trying to cut corners and are now buying cheaper chicken, it shows and it ruins everything.  The service was still wonderful, but I'm afraid I can't go back with this type of quality.  And we told them we didn't like one of the dishes, (being polite and not saying all 3) and they just said okay, I will see.  Whatever that means.  Back to the drawing board.  Where next to go for Chinese food......?"}
{"text":"This is another place where I just can't fathom from whom all the 4 and 5-star reviews come from!  I've both dined in and ordered take out from this place (because it's close to my house), but I won't buy any more food from this restaurant.  We've ordered orange chicken, sezhuan beef and mixed vege stir fry, among other things.  I totally agree with other reviewers who found the food mostly bland and flavorless.  Portions were also relatively small as I recall, while the prices were proud.  You could get frozen chinese entrees and fried rice from the grocery store and have a better/cheaper meal than this place offers.  In fact, they ought to rename this place So-So Dragon."}
{"text":"It's the best quick Chinese to go or sit in restaurant for miles.  Only place I go for my Chinese fix.  Try to pork fried rice, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Super Dragon and all of the employees!  They always greet me with a smile and they know which table I love to sit at and always seat me there if it's available.  The food is always excellent and they even know what I get every lunch time when I go there for their lunch specials!   I almost always get the hot and sour soup and the Kung Pao chicken, so they've memorized that too!  The food is always ready within just a few minutes, fastest service Ever!!! The young man who sets up the tables and keep your water glasses full is an exceptional employee!   He is extremely attentive and very sweet!   I always go to Super Dragon when my sister and I go out for Chinese Food because it's my favorite restaurant!  I love all the people there and the food is amazing!  =D"}
{"text":"We have been getting take out from this restaurant for YEARS! It's basically the only Chinese food I've had in the Phoenix area. The woman who works take out is very nice and efficient. Other reviewers who say the employees are rude are either too sensitive or don't understand that there is a language barrier. 
Overall, the food is decent. I would recommend the Walnut Prawn,  XO String Beans, and Shrimp Lo Mein. I recently got their Kung Pao Chicken and it wasn't the best dish I've ever had. However, I love this restaurant and will usually get their take out when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Umm...Hard to write a review about this place. You can tell they have been around for a long time and a lot of their customer base are constantly returning. But I honestly felt like the food was nothing to write home about. It was just okay. However I can think of many other places where the food is a lot better. The food here does not feel modern and it feels very tired. Kind of an old-fashioned take on Chinese American food. There are other places one can go to where one can experience something much better with much better flavor and an overall better experience. But lots of families looked like they were having a good time so I hate to yuk their yum."}
{"text":"Food is great!! Prompt customer service, a little pushy but they are on it. My glass was never empty and food is prepared perfectly everytime. Never any undercooked mushy rice. The house chicken is crispy and the sauce is not like any other house sauce. The sizzling rice soup is what got me hooked. It's full of flavor, egg drop, pork, shrimp, chicken, water chestnuts, veggies, and the rice."}
{"text":"The food is good yet with the service I had to give 4 stars. The best service in Phoenix by far! The servers go out of their way to make sure your taken care . The second you sit down they give you water (everytime I have been here) and they give you complimentary soup :)"}
{"text":"This place has been here for ever. Really good food. And if you wonder where us Jews eat Christmas Eve, this is it. Can you say POO POO Plater."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday on Xmas day. My husband n I have been looking for a good Chinese place since our favorite Little Peking closed down. So far, of all the ones we tried, this place comes the closest! N to top it off, the same server was working here so it gave us hope!

We started off w the pan fried dumplings and sizzling rice soup. The dumplings were good. A little greasy but we got pan fried so that's expected. Next time I'll ask for steamed. Then our sizzling rice soup cake. It was more like a seafood egg drop soup. But it was very flavorful and the sizzling rice came out perfect! 

My husband ordered his go to: beef n broccoli. It was very good. And I ordered the hunan shrimp which came w a lot of vegetables and jumbo shrimp that isn't deep fried. Overall, I was very happy w the flavors and all the food. Will definitely come back m try something else!! Also not greasy like what others complained about. It's Chinese what do u expect???"}
{"text":"Stopped for late lunch.  It was great. Taste. Fast service. Lots on the menu.  Parking on the street when busy."}
{"text":"This is our neighborhood Chinese restaurant and boy are we lucky.  

The food here is well prepared, hot and reasonably priced.  Whether dine in or take out, it's always reliable.  

Our Christmas tradition is having supper at a Chinese restaurant (as it is for most Jews) and it's always at the Dragon.  Warning: Christmas is a zoo here with people spilling out onto Northern waiting to get a table. We generally eat here about twice a month.
 
The Peking duck is outstanding and the Chow Fun is wonderful.  The owner is a hoot.  The service can be spotty, especially on Christmas but generally very good."}
{"text":"Honestly this place is pretty good. I'm still looking for that Chinese place that I can't live without. But the food is pretty good and the service isn't annoying and they are pretty attentive. I get take out here all the time and the girl at the counter has her take out skills down cold. She ALWAYS has my order ready when I get there and I SWEAR my order has NEVER been wrong. I'm so happy about this I tell everyone and tip her a little extra because the effort really goes a long way with me. So thank you for that. I would love this place a little more if they had delivery."}
{"text":"Super flavored, hot fresh lunch!! Huge portions with soup, egg roll and fried rice all for $7.95..great deal.  Had the mingolian beef and kung pao chicken which was really good.  Will be back!!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints!!!  Lunch or Dinner, it doesn't matter I'll be there :p  Food is awesome, and not overpriced! Anyway, if you decide to go or not it's totally up to you. But if you do make sure you try the sesame chicken and the chicken lo mein, and the Mongolian beef. They are very very good!"}
{"text":"The service was super fast and friendly, but we were disappointed with the portion size on our honey walnut shrimp. We ordered the dinner portion and got a very small serving that left us still hungry. Comparing the serving size to what my dining partner got in chicken makes me think the solution is just to not order shrimp. Everything tasted good though!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Chinese food! Their hot and sour soup is the best I've had in Phoenix. Cave tonight and had Orange Beef and it was also the best I've had ever! Two of my favorites and how I judge my Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Had waitress Irene initially very pleasant i made reference to kung poa chicken not being spicy enough...then came the attitude and rude service, mind you the meal had not been touched..received second plate nearly thrown down with nothing said...sure enough NO CHICKEN ON REPLACEMENT"}
{"text":"huge portions. steaming hot and super fast too!"}
{"text":"This place is great I ordered the fried duck fried rice and my friend ordered the pepper beef and it was very flavorful very good the service was great and the doc was perfect right place of all the service was nice and the people are very friendly"}
{"text":"Very authentic chinese food, need to know what to order.

The Sizzling Rice Soup is good, roasted duck, fish filet with green beans or baby bok choy or gai lon and young chow or house fried rice is a favorite. 

I like the salty fish, but you have to aquire a taste for it plus thus item needs to be preordered a few hours prior to arriving. Must eat it with rice and oyster sauce to calm down the flavor. 

The Peking Duck is also a winner but on the expensive side.

Always great service, but limited parking unless you park in the side street. 

Will definitely be back."}
