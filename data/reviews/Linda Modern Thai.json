{"text":"I was looking forward to having their pad thai. I was disappointed and sad.  The service here is great and the ambience is quite nice. If only my pad thai didn't taste so tangy and sour, filled with fish sauce. It just didn't taste right. The egg wrap did not taste very good on top of the pad thai either. It was very dry and almost sweet. It was definitely not worth $18, not even $5 to be honest.  I don't like to write bad reviews, but this was actually bad. If a Thai restaurant can't do the pad thai right, then I'm not so sure about the rest."}
{"text":"Hello All,   Soooo, my wife and i decided check out Linda's at Shops at Donmills last night. We asked for a table outside. The server took about 15 minutes before coming over and asking if we would like anything to drink. I ordered a bottle of MASI priced at $38. She(Server) brings something completely different and asks me if this is the bottle i would like.  We end up going with a Pinot as they didnt have what we wanted,   10 minutes later, she comes over to take our food order....starter.....spring rolls....easy enough right ....not for this server....she forgets to put the order in and about 30 minutes later we have our main course.....i order   Chicken Panang ($17.....way to expensive for what it was)  and my wife   some vegetable hot pot with tofu skin and mushroom in it($17...way to expensive for what it was)  I spoke to the manager/ owner of this location. Pleasant person who tried to defuse the situation by telling me that the order was placed but was overcooked and the kitchen forgot to prepare another order for us....Admirable of him to stick by his staff when she had already told me....she forgot to place the order ...  i sit here now....writing this review having been to the washroom 3 times in the last 15 minutes.....my stomach is in absolute agony....  We expected much better for the amount they are charging for basic Thai food...  NEVER AGAIN WILL I BE EATING AT LINDA'S   Grand total for a horrible night = $ 71.23 for two people   two mains and a half liter of wine....they comped the spring rolls....nice enough but my tummy is still killing me...  that's my 2 cents for ya....follow it and you'll save yourselves a DOLLAR"}
{"text":"Definitely only 1 star worthy. The waitress only came to our table ONCE to ask how we were doing...and spoke  very fast because she wanted to rush back to the table beside us to kiss their asses. After we paid for our bill, she comes back and asks for more tips..... WHO DOES THAT?! I felt that she didn't even deserve any extra tip because she didn't even provide us with amazing service. Besides, anyone can tip whatever percentage they want. People don't even have to tip if they don't want to. So I found that extremely rude. I will NEVER return here again. The manager didn't even try and talk to us about what happened which I thought was ridiculous.The food's not even great............"}
{"text":"This place made my heart jump and left me breathless at times.  Can't recommend it enough for that special get away."}
{"text":"One of our party had been here before and recommended it. What a great recommendation!  we ordered the mango salad, fried duck, beef pannang?, pineapple fried rice, some special noodle dish, and ended off with a mango roll with lychee ice cream.  The mango salad was a refreshing, palette cleansing appetizer, and a hint of great things to come.  Soon after, the good food flood gates flung open and we were served the beef pannang, fried duck, rice, and noodles.  The clear winner was the beef pannang. Tender, deep fried, with a aromatic, and fragrant curry.   The Fried Duck was also very moist and crisp, and a together with the wrap, celery, hoi sin sauce provided a multi-faceted alternative to the other mildly spicy dishes.  The noodles were fresh and springy to the bite, with a lightly spiced sauce. The shrimp and chicken was large and well textured.  The fried rice lacked the forceful flavours of the other dishes, and the rice itself was a bit dry. Still a good dish, just not as good in light of the other dishes.  The dessert was much smaller than we had anticipated, but the deep friend \"roll\" was perfectly done. Crispy, without being oily. the lychee ice cream was slightly bland, but provided a good compliment to the mango roll.  Our server was polite and helpful, although towards the end of our meal, her service levels fell (empty water glasses, long wait for dessert menu and orders).  It was busy and slightly noisy, but adds to the overall good atmosphere of the restaurant.  5/5 (the faults are mentioned only for balance, overall it was a great meal)"}
{"text":"The restaurant's décor is very creative with elepant drawings on the walls and golden statues for a temple looking venue. It looks a lot bigger from the outside but stepping into the restaurant, the spaces between tables are limited but none the less, breath-taking.  Linda's is the sister restaurant to Salad King but even though they are under the same management, there are differences between the two such as more distinctive dishes at Linda's instead of the fast food kind you get at Salad King and of course the price! Linda's being the more extravagant and expensive one of course. It also seems that they spend more time on the food here as in the creative aspect of the dishes as well.  Their Thai dishes are decent but like I said, the prices are a bit high for the small portion you get but very tasty. If you do come here, I suggest the Golden Curry and the Beef Panang which was initially proposed by our waitress ( Beef Panang FTW! it was soooo good we ended getting 2 orders of it so I highly recommend this dish). The food is great but I'm not sure if I'm willing to spend $20 for a tiny share of curry and rice."}
{"text":"We went for summerlicious and really enjoyed our dinner. The waitress was exceptional. She was very polite and checked out us periodically. When she knows we can take extra spicy. She brought out a few spicy sauce for us to choose. We really like this place."}
{"text":"Great brunch with Thai flair. Tried out a new brunch menu today. The eggs Benedict Thai style consists of smoked duck on poached eggs in Penang curry sauce. It was delicious. There was a smoked salmon in Green curry sauce. I did not try but looked great. Eggs and Thai sausage was also a great consistency and not salty. We did not try the spicy sausage. However, the regular one made with chicken and pork was perfect for Chinese tastes. The main courses also come with sides. These include Thai congee, home fries or mango salad. In addition the breads include regular western bread or fried breadstick.  Drinks that I recommend include a hot ginger tea and coconut water served in the coconut. You can't go wrong here if you want a little twist to breakfast."}
{"text":"We went here a few weeks ago for the first time.  The place is lovely! The decor is beautiful and very impressive.  Our waitress was very pleasant, and the food came quickly.  Excellent jasmin tea!!!!!!!  For an appetizer, we had the calamari, and it was really good! Not too rubbery, and the sauce it came with complemented it nicely - very flavourful.   For our meal, we had the crispy beef, shrimp pad thai, and rice with panang curry - all very good. I'm not a big fan of beef myself, so I didn't enjoy that as much - but it was delish, nonetheless. Big recommendation from me :)"}
{"text":"I actually enjoy going to Salad King in DT for fast Thai food. So I had certain expectations from Linda.    Food:  - I ordered Green Curry Chicken with rice, and Golden Curry Chicken with naan ($2 extra). Golden Curry itself was little sweet, but bearable. Surprisingly, naan tasted good. It wasn't traditional Indian naan. It was thin, moist and made out of whole wheat. Green Curry Chicken was disappointing. It wasn't bad, but it was pretty much same as what Salad King offers at their location.   Service:  - I went on Thursday for lunch after 2pm. So it was really quite, and there were only 2 more tables with customers, so customers obviously expect waiters to be attentive. But when we went in, there was photoshoot going on for the restaurant, and all the waiters were around it, not realizing that there were customers waiting infront of the door awkwardly for few minutes. Other than that, they were approachable most of the time.  Atmosphere: - It has modern oreintal feel to it. Tables are not crowded together, and has enough spaces between tables. Hall itself is not big, but it looks pretty spacious due to their table set up.  In conclusion, I would recommend Linda for people who enjoy going to Saland King but live uptown."}
{"text":"Amazing ambience and excellent food. I had the Thai Islamic noodles and they were to die for. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, but TERRIBLE customer service.   Spent 30minutes trying to get through on the phone to no avail. When the manager called back, he gave an explanation on how they are too busy to answer the phones. This was not the first time it has been difficult to get through to place a takeout order. When you do get through, expect long waits for your food.  Again while the food is great (delicious actually), it is highly priced and probably not worth the terrible and frankly at time cocky customer service.   They own salad king, who do a great job. Would recommend them over Linda's any day of the week."}
{"text":"Solid and innovative Thai restaurant. A lot of unique dishes on the menu. Ordered the off menu lobster curry special, which was an excellent and tasty dish. It was a part of the price fixe menu.  I do feel while Linda's provides a solid dining experience that it is a bit on the pricey side for Thai food. However, a great idea for date night if you don't mind the price tag."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now for dinner over the last 6 months or so. The first time was fabulous but the last two times I didn't really enjoy the dinner. Their curry is still amazing and I also love their thai lemonade. But the service was so so, the waitress who served us seemed really stressed and rushed, a bit abrasive. The sofa seat was dirty. There were fruitflies swarming around us during the whole meal (we sat indoors, nowhere near the patio). We found the servings to be small, even the share plates. I remember the first time I dined there the crispy beef curry serving was very generous but the last two times it has been very skimpy on the meat. Our second visit was the worse, it took forever for the food to come we almost wanted to leave the restaurant. All in all I think this place has potential but really needs to improve on the cleanliness, service and the food portions."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch & was not impressed.  No one at the front to great us... wasn't sure if it was opened or not.   When someone finally came to seat us we asked for a seat with a patio. He quickly checked availability & said to follow him. As we walked I explained that 2 people was coming to join us & he simply said \" I don't care\". I thought that was a bit rude. He sat us at a table without giving us a menu & walked away.  It wasn't extremely busy but I had to go in & asked for the menu after waiting five minutes for someone to come to our table.  Finally after another a long wait, ordered mango salad & chicken skewers, chicken pineapple fried rice, seafood fried rice & pai Thai.  Mango salad - nothing to write home about. Chicken skewers with peanut sauce was yummy.  Chicken pineapple fried rice had neither of those two things! No chicken at all! & no pineapples only pineapple sauce. Had shrimp"}
{"text":"Food is great. There is no doubt. But when it comes to service, it is hit and miss. It was weekday night. Restaurant wasn't busy at all. My husband dish came out more than 10 minutes after mine. Also the server (who I believe it was a manager) never came back to check up on us. We actually had to get up and walked up to the bar to grab more drinks. And he didn't even apologize for such a bad service! I would hate to give 2 stars to this place but every time we go there, service is terrible."}
{"text":"I went here for a girls night. The restaurant had a nice ambience and our server was pleasent.  We ordered 3 apps and our mains.   I got the Royal pad thai, it was ok but my friend coconut seafood curry served in a coconut was AMAZING  3 apps, shared bottle of wine,shared dessert  main dishes with tip came out to $54 a person (3 of us)which is kinda steep as I've been  to other places  and had more.  Wish they had more food options on the menu.  BuT i would go back again."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of the shops at Don Mills, this Thai restaurant knows how to do their thing. From the decor to the food this place really knows how to do Thai. They have share-able appetizers that are betel leaves that you turn into some taco-thing that are unique and delicious. They do the essential tom-yung goong soups to perfection and their mains are portioned just right. The service has always been on point at Linda's and they have a summerlicious and winterlicious menu select times during the year for people who want to try it out.  I would recommend this for families and couples looking to enjoy some Thai food before or after shopping their hearts and wallets out. Speaking of wallets Linda is priced very well, its no salad-king but for the quality of food and service it is worth it."}
{"text":"We went there for a friend's birthday just a few weeks ago and we thought this was a really great thai restaurant. servers were nice and we believe we met the owners of the restaurants that came to chat with us about the dishes as it came out.   We tried the set menu for October and basically ordered the whole menu off that list.  Starter (listing from the best) 1) Crispy Papaya Salad - usually I do not order salad as a starter as I believe I can make it at home or nothing special could be in the salad. This salad proved me wrong. the fried papaya and the vinaigrette was to die for, it would definitely increase your appetite for the main course and dessert.  2) Baked Pacific Clam - clam baked with garlic goodness. This was really good as well as it was served as it were escargot and it just tasted wonderful 3) Thai Pumpkin Soup - tasted good similar to lobster soup. Not one of my favourite but still decent.   Entreé 1) Thai glutinous rice wrapped in crispy duck - awesome dish. I will definitely post a picture of this when I get the chance. It was the highlight of the whole meal. Duck wrapped in rice with a really nice sauce. It was also placed really beautifully too. 2)Thai Panang curry with coconut milk, peanuts - never had i had curry that good and the taste of the coconut milk is just really rich and creamy 3)Basil Chicken - This is basically stir fry chicken with basil. tasted good as well. It had \"wok hey\" sorry I don't know how to translate that but that's in chinglish  To complete the meal off: Poach Pear in wine sauce and Tropical Ice cream -the poach pear definitely helped to end this wonderful meal  or Deep-fried apple and Tropical Ice cream"}
{"text":"Fantastic food!!  I just loved your Pad Thai but the mango salad had too much cilantro to handle.  The ambiance was exceptional...as soon as you walk in it felt like you were in a palace."}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered from the Winterlicious menu. So far so good. Nothing really surprising except the crispy beef brisket, Thats a must have if u r visiting here. service is pretty good as well. Atmosphere here is good."}

{"text":"APPALLING SERVICE - POORLY TRAINED WAITRESS AND MANAGER. If you are contemplating trying this restaurant, please do yourself a favour and forget about it. There are so many other Thai restaurants out there, with good food and great service (Pai, Sukho Thai, Eat BKK, Khao San Road etc).  Jacky (with the blondish hair and glasses)...you are a poorly-trained waitress. Your mom must not have taught you any manners, and you seem challenged with understanding how to be an adult. Hopefully one day you will figure it out.  You came by to take our order. I asked for a chicken pad thai, forgetting to indicate the chili level and proceeded to ask you what the difference was between the green and yellow curry. Responding in a snarky tone, you cut me off demanding that I was going way too fast because I didn't tell you what chili level I wanted (I think a 4 year old could keep up, so I don't see why you couldn't); you then abruptly asked me if I had ever even eaten here before, as if I was giving off vibes that I hadn't; in fact though, embarrassingly yes, I have eaten there multiple times before.  Someone else I was with, who is visiting Toronto, then tried asking you about the green and yellow curries after I didn't get a response when I asked. Again, your attitude got in the way as you rudely responded, \"I can't hear anything you're saying\". Having worked in the restaurant industry before myself, I would never have spoken to a customer like this. Perhaps, \"SORRY ma'am, I can't hear what you are saying because it's really loud in the restaurant, do you mind repeating that?\" would have been the approach to take.    After telling you that I didn't appreciate how you were speaking to me, I requested a new waitress. We got Mandy, who was great.   Then, about 2 minutes later, you walked by, and, as if we were 13 year old girls having a catfight about a boy, you looked at me and scrunched up your face, giving me your most sarcastic expression (oh, did you stick your tongue out at me too?), like you were mocking me for telling you off. I'm not sure what you were thinking, but honey let me tell you how ridiculous you looked!   So after your breakdown in performance, I spoke with the manager.   For anyone reading this, that was a god-awful idea. Why? Brought up Jacky's issues and behaviour with her manager, who offered NO APOLOGY but instead muttered to me, \"thank you for my feedback\". Dude, what planet are you on?! Is \"sorry\" not in your vocabulary?! Don't we learn how to be apologetic when we are in pre-school? Are you not going to tell me that there will be disciplinary action towards your staff member because customer service is something you take pride in?   After our meal was finished, Mr. Manager gave us the bill, charging for everything we ordered at full price; again, no apology given at this time.   I have eaten at a lot of restaurants in my lifetime (it's unfortunate I haven't documented them on yelp) and when I have encountered issues with service, 10 times out of 10, I have been offered an apology at the very least. That is called CUSTOMER SERVICE and you should be learning that the first day on the job. Hospitality 101. Mr. Manager, you've got a long way to go in that department because you seriously lack it.   Overall I am SHOCKED and have never been so FLABBERGASTED by the ridiculousness of the situation and the lack of service I received from both immature and poorly-trained Jacky as well as her incompetent manager counterpart. Of course I WILL NOT BE RETURNING. Sadly, Yelp doesn't give the option of NO STARS, because that is definitely what this restaurant deserves if judged by the service (the food is about a 3).  Suggestion to you both: put your big girl/boy panties on and start taking customer service seriously.  Suggestion to Yelpers: avoid this restaurant unless you want to be subjected to seriously terrible service."}
{"text":"I've been to Linda's twice now. The first time I went, it was for a wedding rehearsal dinner with a tasting menu. Great atmosphere, but still quite busy midweek.   I went back for dinner last Friday. I made a reservation for 8pm but we finished shopping earlier and they were able to seat us at 7:30. I ordered the duck curry that I had last time, which was delicious. My friend ordered the crispy duck which was very good! It's presenting Peking duck style, with wraps and sauces. The duck meat is prepared differently, more roasted and the meat literally flakes and falls off the bone, but so juicy! The waitress should shred this for you. This with wraps and the additional shitake mushrooms are yummy.   For dessert, the portions are smaller for their prices, but a good selection of choices. We had the chocolate/green tea mochi ice cream and chocolate burst. I really liked chocolate burst which is rice balls, filled with warm chocolate, then rolled in toasted sesame seeds.   My only comment was that the dishes are presented Chinese style, meaning that each dish came out one at a time, instead of together since my friend and I ordered our own separately, so you might want to make that request.   It's Asian Fusion, so not cheap, but it's a good meal out if you are hanging out at Shops at Don Mills."}
{"text":"food not bad, too much oil in the sea food rice, Mango salad not good, chicken plates are good though, waitresses very rude and snobbish and not nice at all, price ok, takes them ages to refill your water glass, cannot leave water on tables and don't offer bigger glasses."}
{"text":"ALLERGIES As with all Thai food, their menu is heavy in shrimp.  Nice at helping me navigate away from shrimp dishes and for making a dish without shrimp so I could eat it (allergy).  That wasn't enough to endear me --- because there were service issues, and I became sick later that night because the crispy duck was clearly fried in the same oil that shrimp is fried in because staff didn't consider that.  FOOD Crispy Duck: Since they have some Chinese ingredients like black bean paste and glutinous rice sesame balls, we assumed that the \"crispy duck w/ steamed buns\" (no other description) would be duck that is roasted until the skin is crispy.  WRONG!  It was battered like KFC except there is just a hint of Chinese Five Spice in the batter seasoning.  She upselled us to get 2 duck legs instead of 1 since it was \"just $3 more.\"  BTW - never mind value, 2 people do not need 2 legs; they are too rich.  She spent entirely too much time at our tiny table for 2 with forks pulling the meat off the bone.  She was nice enough, but meanwhile our other food was getting cold and it ruined the mood for a romantic date.  Despite other positive aspects, this made us DESPISE the restaurant:  The duck came w/ 6 tiny moo shu \"tortillas\" (not steamed buns like described).  Yet there is not even enough tiny sticks of cucumber and celery so there is one per tortilla.  The celery was dried out.  They skimped on the tiny bowl of Hoisin sauce that accompanies it.  We asked for a few more tortillas since there was clearly not enough for the 2 legs we were pressured to get.  We were told they cost more & we said fine.  Then she said \"it only comes as a package\" so we would have to buy more duck legs to get more tortillas.  Say wuh?!  Talk about the most stupid policy and horrible customer service!  I have to pay another $20+ to get tortillas that cost pennies?  No option to get them a la carte?!  We had already over stuffed each tortilla w/ duck so that it was embarrassing to eat the mess in a sit down restaurant (no wet naps), but we still needed more tortillas. How much do the tortillas cost?   Being cheap and inflexible over a few pennies cost them a customer.  Chicken Pad Thai: It was wrapped in a paper thin omelet instead of having egg tossed w/ the pasta. Hadn't seen that before. A few tomato and lime slices around the side w/ a sprinkling of peanuts on top.  The old limes were dried out & had brown skins!  They skimped on the peanuts (maybe 1 teaspoon on top of omelet), which is usually my favourite part.  Why are they consistently so stingy & cheap?!!!  Irregular pieces of chicken breast  were overcooked and not seasoned.    The linguine rice noodles were above average, and made w/ tasty traditional tamarind instead of the ketchup like most places.  It was mushy, though, perhaps because of few crunchy vegetables to balance it out.  The tofu was super greasy, not puffy, and oil oozed out of it when biting it in half.  First time I haven't like the fried tofu in pad Thai.  DESSERT Mango sticky rice: It looked like 3 large scallops (cylinders) on top of thin fresh mango squares and draped w/ coconut milk & sesame seeds.  Seriously two-bite brownie size!  1 teaspoon minced strawberry.  Again, why so cheap?  Sticky rice is not expensive & all other Thai restaurants give 1 cup+. They are not fine dining enough to not give traditional abundant family size portions.    RESERVATIONS I could see that they would be required during peak dining times because the space isn't too big.  I'm guessing it seats between 75-100.  Not much of a waiting area.  When we walked in, they asked if we had reservations.  They didn't welcome us first even though there was no one else waiting.  That was off putting.  AMBIANCE Dim lighting.  Lots of carved lace-like teak wood.  Large gold Buddha in the middle of the room.  Photo wallpaper w/ another large gold Buddha and traditional Thai gold dancer's mask.  Partitions of sorts don't truly block you from neighbouring seats.  Not a great place for business or kid meals.  DRINKS Good range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic.  Though, I didn't order it, I was pleased to see they had Thai tea on the menu.  Their Ginger Tea and Lemongrass Tea were tasty, but are WAY too sweet.  They make them there, but it is viscous (not refreshing) because they make them with tons of simple syrup.  The ginger has big chunks of ginger at the bottom of the glass so it has lots of heat to it if you don't like strong ginger.  The first round was lukewarm so I could actually gulp it down because they failed to warm up the tall tea glasses first.  Refill wasn't brought until late in meal (only got another because it was a freezing cold night & not because I liked it so much I wanted more).  The restaurant was not  busy, so there is no excuse for that tardiness w/ a bored bartender.  HANDICAP ACCESSIBLE?  Yes. Bathroom on same floor but narrow seating areas.  FREE MALL PARKING - garage tower, lot, & few adjacent"}
{"text":"I was just here for a wedding this weekend. My girl friend had booked off the whole restaurant as a private event. I had a great time! The food was exceptionally great! All the plates were all served hot. The Venue is a little bit small, for a wedding, but I think everyone had a really good time. And the setting made it a bit more casual, which allowed the bride/groom and their whole family to mingle with their guest, and to keep the event cozy.  The Owners were at the event , and gave a brief description and/or history about the food being served.  The wait staff were friendly.    All the appetizers and H'or deurves were excellent!  The Lobster Bisque was very flavourful- a bit salty, but considering no MSG was used, the taste is really strong and wonderful.  We had a variation of the Poached Sable fish yesterday, with the same sauce and cooking style (the fish choice was changed based on the family request), but it was fantastic. The fish was prepared, so that it melted in your mouth.  I have been a fan of Salad King for years, before their renovations, and the birth of Linda Modern Thai restaurant, when they were pretty much on the Ryerson Campus! The Owners have always been cheerful, with great memory, and served amazing food!    Normally on a regular day, The Thai Islamic, and the Thai Basil Noodle on their menu is super delicious! The calamari is yummy too!"}
{"text":"Best Thai uptown. Love the sticky rice and mango desserts.  Fresh coconuts on the menu are wonderful. The staff are absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"Pros Nice location Ambiance is good Service is fast Friendly staff Good presentation Red curry was on par  Cons Dinner for two $74 Duck was smoked and dry, gummy Lamb was as dry as it can get"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Expensive and portion have no veggies. Was just plain sauce. Skip"}
{"text":"Unbelievably slow service. We ordered our food at 9:11pm and they served our dinner at 10:15pm. The food was really poor quality. Don't order the crispy duck leg."}
{"text":"Great deco. Slow service--Errors all the time. Summerlicious lunch on weekends. Not really packed. Lots of empty tables.  Greetings at reception was up to standard. Waitress seems not well-trained.  Specifically asked for hot water, ended up sending us cold water.   Asked for nakins, never came.  Had to asked one more time.  (PS: The whole time the restaurant was not packed at all) Food was nice, considered it was the Summerlicious menu. Curry was aromatic.  We had a full stomach because of the bowl of rice given.  Not the most authentic Thai food restaurant, rather it's a westernized (modern) Thai fusion.  Will bring out-of-town friends to visit again, due to the beautiful deco."}
{"text":"Been here many times before, and it was great.  It's been a while, but something has changed. The curry chicken was a plain grilled chicken breast sitting in an overly sweet yellow curry sauce.  The pad thai was okay but again not something to write home about as it was too sweet and luke warm.  The service was average at best. We didn't have a reservation on a Saturday night, but the host made it seem like a big deal to give us a table for three.  He says he needed the table back in 90 minutes.  When we walked in, most tables were empty.  Seriously?!?!?   When we left about an hour later, there were stilln plenty of empty tables.    Needless to say, tonight was the last time dining at Linda.  Too bad this restaurant is now off of Thai list.  It used to be so delicious."}
{"text":"Nice decor inside. We were able to sit on the patio. Setting was a little tight out there as they had heat lamps taking up some space. I found it very expensive and our food too way too long (entrees came out about 45 minutes after we ordered.) We were not advised of any delays nor any acknowledgment of such a long wait. Shared 2 orders of spring rolls among 4 people. Very disappointing. They had a heavy shell and little filling and very small (two bites maybe). Could have gotten better ones frozen at the grocery store.  As my main I had green curry shrimp. I was impressed with the shrimp in my dish. There were about 8 shrimp and they were nice sized. I had a huge bowl of curry sauce and a tiny side bowl of rice. I asked for more rice as there was not enough for the amount of sauce given, but that'll cost you $2, which is fair if they had given a decent amount to begin with. I found this restaurant over-rated and over-priced. You'd get the same food at Salad King for a better price."}
{"text":"The Tom Yum was the most amazing I ever had wonderful sweetness and sourness! Great atmosphere with beautiful wooden metallic doors to red wooden screens inside. Appreciated they were closing at 3:00 when we arrived at 2:36 ... But let's us eat enjoy and didn't rush us out. Fabulous service."}
{"text":"For a quick review:   Service for the most part was quick and courteous. Nothing to complain about here.  Ordered Pad Thai and Duck curry. The Pad thai was a little small portioned for the cost, but the presentation was quite unique, as it was wrapped in a thin shell of egg, keeping the dish warm. I would have preferred a little more sauce to add some more flavour, but I believe that's just preference. Duck curry was nothing short of fantastic though. The duck was cooked perfectly, nice and simply, full of juicy flavour, as was the curry. Much better portions too.   Atmosphere was moderate - A baby was also seated right beside us however, which  might skew my opinion.   Might try again in the future."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a month.  One word...delicious! Great service. Food presentation is lovely. Today I had their Golden Tofu Curry. Yum!"}
{"text":"Bring Linda back!! What happened to this place? We haven't been back to this restaurant in a few years and we went recently and was surprised that everything was downhill from what we remembered. The food was sub-par Thai if you could call it that. Flavors were definitely off and what really was awful was the golden curry chicken that came as a piece of grilled chicken breast swimming in a pool of yellow sauce. The chicken was just placed on top of the sauce and not even cut up or coated. Huh? What happened to the flavorful golden curry chicken I remembered from before? Service was good but the food is crap. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Overall I find this place to be overpriced for what it is.   Mango salad $7 - mostly cabbage with a few slices of mango that I couldn't taste. Don't order this. I would hardly call it a mango salad  Chicken satay $10 - we ordered the large which came with 6 skewers. The chicken was tender and the pieces were decently sized but this dish was nothing special. Couldn't really taste the peanut sauce  Golden curry with tofu $14 - came with 6 pieces of tofu, a handful of veggies, very little sauce, and a side of rice. The waiter recommended the golden curry but it was nothing special and certainly wasn't a big enough portion to be worth $14. We got the mild, which means not spicy at all, if you're not good with spice.  I guess if you're craving Thai food it'll do the trick but I won't be coming here again as there are so many other good thai restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"Went: 12:00 pm Fri July 17 2015 Ordered: satay shrimp + thai tacos + custard Cost: incl. $20.54 + $3.00 tip Customer Service: I have never been more impressed with the customer service at a restaurant. 1. When the woman who seats us was calling people to confirm reservations, that was a good sign. I've made a lot of reservations and they never call back. 2. We are small eaters and wanted to share a Summerlicious meal. Some places don't like that, but they were fine. 3. We only had an hour for lunch and had to leave sooner than we liked and told the waiter this and asked for the entree and dessert together. They said fine, but what really impressed was that they brought the bill right away and was ready to process it quickly. 4. The waiter then said the chefs are putting all other orders on hold and cooking ours first. Wow! 5. The manager came by to tell us because of a printing problem and that is why our remaining items were delayed, but he arranged it so that we'd get our entree soon and the dessert would be to go. 6. In the end, they gave us an extra dessert on the house. Food: The shrimps were cooked in a buttered sauce I believe. Some of them had a lot more flavour than others. The peanut sauce was light on that salty fatty peanut taste and had more of a refreshing sweetness to it. There were 6 loonie size pieces. Very good. The Thai tacos were wrapped in a pastry resembling that used for Peking duck. A lot of tacos can taste greasy or heavy but this was quite light and was very nice. We were in a hurry, so I ate my dessert in the car and liked it: not to sweet, nice texture, tasty. Bottom line: The food is 3.75 Stars, so we'll round up to a 4. The customer service is definitely 5 Stars and will stand out in my mind for a long time, and will have me coming back."}
{"text":"Linda, you make some great Thai food!!  Also, your restaurant is quite nice and you have hired some great wait staff.  We had dinner at your establishment last night and thoroughly enjoyed our experience. We were warmly greeted with a beautiful and sincere smile and our waitress for the evening was extremely friendly. She was knowledgable, attentive, and fulfilled all our requests without any fuss.  The restaurant itself was nicely appointed and it was a nice place to enjoy a meal after a long day. When I arrived, I was glad to see it was fairly busy but it was still easy to sit and hold a conversation without having to raise your voice.  For dinner, we had the Oyster pancake to start. Although the flavour was nice, I felt this dish could have been served a little hotter as it was only lukewarm when it was served. After the pancake, we had the Royal Pad Thai and the Golden Curry. In my opinion Linda, you make one of the best Golden or yellow curries I have had. It is rich, creamy, and has great flavour!  Having it with medium spice gave it just enough kick to make it that much more enjoyable. The Pad Thai was also good. It was just a touch too sweet for my taste, but that is just my personal preference as I'm sure most people wouldn't mind the sweetness and find it appropriate. It was also a nice touch to have the Pad Thai come wrapped in a fried egg. Sticky mango rice was a great way to finish the meal even for someone like me who doesn't like sweets. The dessert was a little on the small side but it was good.  Although the prices are higher than your other establishment, Salad King, I guess that's to be expected given the nicer, more upscale dining experience.   Not that Salad King is a bad dining experience, but there is a difference in experience and ambience when you sit at a communal table versus your own table. While Salad King is a much better value, the prices at Linda are reasonable.  Thanks for a great meal Linda!  The service was a cut above and the food was good and satisfying enough to relieve the rigours of a long day."}
{"text":"I have never been a fan of Thai food since it seems so unhealthy with all the deep-frying and sweetness. I went here for a friend since that was the cuisine preference. On top of that it was summerlicious. The service was very slow and the host at the front wasn't the best at it. We got seated and the food came at a reasonable pace (by that I mean, if we weren't busy in our conversation the entire time it was slow). I tried a appetizer, main and dessert. Appetizer, the lettuce wrap was not to my liking. The mango salad was decent and mango was fresh and tasty. The crispy beef in panang curry was a great dish. I had the mango sticky rice for dessert but it was very sweet thus I poked at it a little. Overall the service by the waitress was good. The service at the front was bad. The food was overall good."}
{"text":"I have been to this area many times but always pass its doors as I think it is just a high end of its sister restaurant Salad King.  The atmosphere is very nice given it the dim light environment and the natural light from the street.  The décor is mostly wood in dark colors mixed with some Thai statue.  The separation of the table is nicely divided giving a rather private spacing.  We order the Fish Curry Hot Pot which is heated up in a pot with the fish and sauce on top of a piece of paper.  The sauce is a bit thick and I cannot taste the fish.  The sauce is too strong to take away the taste and smell of the fish.  Another dish is King Oyster with Tofu.  It uses the circular roll of tofu and deep fried the surface.  The Oyster mushroom is fried just right.  However there are too many pieces of tofu that are the ends of a roll that looks like a cone.  Remember there are only 2 ends for each roll.  For a high end restaurant, it should not happen.  The most is to give 2 ends of the same roll of tofu in a dish to a customer.  The Pineapple Fried Rice presentation is very good with the rice cupped in the centre with the shrimp nicely displayed like an octopus.  Of the 3 dishes, I personally like the Fried Rice the best.  For desserts, the Deep Fried Banana is yummy.  For the home made Pistachio ice cream, the Pistachio taste is very light.  I won't miss it.  The waitress is very polite and smiling all the time.  Once in a while, she will come over to ask if the food is ok or if we need anything.  She is really nice.  It definitely adds a star to the restaurant."}
{"text":"My stars are mainly attributed to the decor of this place. It is pretty to look at and has a great overall atmosphere but don't be deceived! Their food is mediocre at best.  We came with a group of 7 on a Sunday afternoon. It was empty. We thought this would mean fast service but considering we were alone, the speed of service was nowhere near great...  We ordered appetizers. The soups came warm/cold and we had to return them to be warmed. The spring rolls were decent.   I ordered the grilled fish in a banana leaf. It came as a full fish in an aluminum bag. I was not expecting this, I was hoping it would be a filet. Being a fish eater I didn't mind much, but it can be a big appetite killer If youre not used to seeing baked fish eyeballs. The vegetables came steamed on the side with an extra bowl of rice.  My friend got the deep fried fish in a curry sauce.  Terrible choice. The fish was drowning in sauce, and it was served in a nearly flat platter (not smart for something so saucy). He had to dig for fish, he failed to find any meat on the fish and after a bit he gave up and asked to change his order. The waitress readily changed the order but the manager came by and and gave her rude and confrontational two cents about the matter. She tried to get him to pay for the fish AND the second plate he ordered in replacement based on the logic that he \"ate half the fish\" already. Funny part is, her observation further confirmed the part about him not finding any meat in the fish to begin with. Her stance, tone of voice and accusations were uncalled for.  To add salt to injury, my other friends and husband ordered curries, all of which came warm/cold.  We returned them all again to be heated.   For an upscale restaurant with prices in the $18+ range, their service and food was just not up to par. Sure it looked nice and was clean....but there was nothing more to be said about this place unfortunately. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Mediocore Thai using cheap ingredients and not much skill.  Overly salty mushroom basil dish tasting like Campbell's chicken broth. Hot and sour soup the size of a large shot glass. Go somewhere else with good tasting authentic thai for half the price.  Good decor though, you can enjoy that while your waiting for your second dish to be brought out because you returned the first for it's gross taste"}
{"text":"Yesterday a friend met up for lunch at Linda Modern Thai.  We chose this venue because in the past it had been well rated, though I had heard it was pricey.  We shared the spring roll appetizer and my friend ordered beef satay with mango salad and my choice was chicken which also came with mango salad and a bowl of rice which we shared.    First of all, the spring rolls were absolutely appalling.  They were dry and tasteless with a filling of bland and slimy mush.  The dipping sauce they came with was a paltry and inadequate serving:  watery, sweetish, into which a few peanuts were scattered.  It helped, but not much   Then came the lunch specials.  With my grilled chicken, the theme of blandness was carried forth to the point of ludicrousness. The waitress had to be summoned, for salt  and peanut sauce which helped, but not enough.  My friend took pity and gave me one of her satays which was dry and tough but at least she got peanut sauce without asking.  One bite was enough for me.  On to the mango salad.  My first bite contained a hard  object which  turned out to be a dried shrimp, I think.  The salad's texture was generally slimy with strands of spiralled carrots flung infor a bit of body.  The flavor?  Sweetly, blandly rancid leaving a metallic taste in the mouth.  Our waitress revealed that the chef was not Thai but Mexican.  I didn't know Mexican chefs did bland.  Over all:a  horrid, nasty, poor quality and expensive meal."}
{"text":"I took my friends there to try it out since I've been before and loved it. First of all, the food is horrible, service is so so but the overall experience was all negative. I ordered the most famous curry apparently and all it was was a curry sauce, thrown veggies in there and pre cooked thrown meat. It was not cooked together or anything and it tasted so bad. I thought it was just my dish, but I tried the other plates as well... Same. I will never be going here again, and this was suppose to be a nice dinner outing to try an amazing place. Guess not!"}
{"text":"Mains were pretty good but Service could be better! The waitresses were not that attentive.   Green curry with chicken was pretty yummy and a good size for a main. Islamic noodles were good but I would have preferred more sauce! I would have preferred the satay to have more of a grilled char to it! Overall pretty decent food. I'd stick to the mains and probably wouldn't order the satay again.   Don't order their Thai iced tea. It tastes like powdered water! :/ I hope they improve their drinks next time!"}
{"text":"Terrible  service.  Sitting at the restaurant for 15 min without any server greeting us. We had to shout  out loud to flag a server down. Each course we need to wait at least 20 minutes  to come. The food is not authentic and soup seems to be watered down. Definitely over priced and we'll never recommend this restaurant to anybody unless they improve."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I've returned and now I know why.  I thought I'd give it another try after reading a few Yelp users positive reviews, but what a mistake.  First of all, after going to Thailand and tasting what amazing dishes Thai food can offer, I've been searching for authentic Thai food all around North America.  While the ambiance is dark and cozy, the food was very quite modified to suite the typical North American palate.  Apps we had included the mango salad (standard), chicken and beef satay skewers were some of the worst I've had anywhere, and the fried calamari had too much breading and was overly oily (thought my kids loved it).  For mains we shared the crispy duck, where the server rips up 2 duck legs and you wrap it ala Peking duck style.  Complete lack of duck flavor and the crispy batter was way too thick.  Plus they charge you an extra $7 if you want more wrappers (as you are forced to get more of the other condiments which is a complete rip off).  The wrappers are likely the stuff you get from a chinese grocery store for $1-2 for a large pack, definitely not tasting like they were freshly made.  Panang curry with crispy beef - while the curry was creamy and went well with the rice, the beef was lacking any texture and again the breading was too thick.  The pad thai was the worse, overly sweet to the point that both my kids didn't want to eat it (and they generally will eat any noodle dish!).  Huge mistake coming here, won't be back... ever."}
{"text":"I love their seafood coconut curry . It's so authentic! This restaurant is highly recommended."}
{"text":"A bit pricy, but the decor, food and service will have to warrant that. Had a very good lunch experience here"}
{"text":"Terrible is an understatement. I would not recommend anyone to come to this restaurant, this was rated 1 star only because it didn't seem to let me rate with no stars. Although the restaurant looks like it's got potential on the exterior, everything about it was just terrible- both service and quality of their food.  For those looking for authentic Thai cuisine, this is def not the place for it.  First, ordered Thai iced teas, it took over 15 mins for the drink to come, and when it finally came, the drink was a bright orange- I've had Thai ice tea before and the color of it was def not suppose to be bright orange (Almost looked like orange food dye was put into it). It was very strange and it did not taste right either, but that's okay because we gave it the benefit of the doubt.   We ordered from the summerlicious menu - probably one of the biggest mistakes, but I can't see the experience being any different even if we had ordered their regular menu. The food took over 45 minutes to come even though the restaurant was not busy, and the food only came out when we had to ask the waiter to follow up with the food. Terrible food quality, def not worth the price. Waiters were not attentive especially when the restaurant was not busy.   At the end of the meal, the manager offered a discount off on the meal because they realized how poor their service was, and I can appreciate that however they also f*d up the discount as well and gave 10 cents off the bill- this was just ridiculous.   Overall, everything about this restaurant was terrible and I'm baffled at how the restaurant is sustaining with this type of service and quality of food. Save yourself from a terrible experience - go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I found the pad thai a little watery and the egg that topped it was a bit rubbery too.   My companion had the special that day, roast duck fried quinoa.  The flavour of the duck was rich and fragrant, but it overpowered the entire dish and the plate seemed a bit over priced."}
{"text":"I came here today for lunch with a group of 7 hungry coworkers. After learning that Linda was launched by the same owners of Salad King, I went in with pretty high expectations (I love Salad King!).   THE GOOD: - I had the panang curry with crispy beef, and it was a hit - I'd give it 4/5 stars. My favourite part was the beef itself, which was tender, juicy and battered - and the light batter coating made for a nice crunch. I've never had crispy beef quite like this before. The curry came with rice and was full of flavour overall. It was $15 - I thought this was good value.   THE BAD: - I understand that lunchtime on Friday is a busy time, but we were really disappointed with the service. We ordered our mains and waited over an hour for our food! The waitress did not come by at any point to apologize for the wait, either. Disappointing.  - The ambience inside and prices were not terrible, but average at best - comparable to other Thai restaurants in the city.   While I enjoyed my meal - particularly the battered beef in my curry - I don't think I would return to Linda again."}
{"text":"We were here for lunch Summerlicious. This was the 2nd year we've done this experience but this time was a huge disappointment. We arrived with 4 in our party instead of the 3 that was initially booked for. We were told that it would be difficult to accommodate us. But when we went into the restaurant, it was completely empty - huh?  Definitely not kid friendly and their regular menu prices are outrageous for what you are getting. I will say our waiter was very cordial and made up for our greeting but I probably won't come again."}
{"text":"I went to Linda's with 3 of my friends. Some appetizers were very delicious but very pricey and each dish wasn't enough to share with 3 others. The main courses are not that special. Do not order Thai Fried Rice (sea food) if you don't like your food too salty and has a strong soy sauce and fish sauce taste. Overall, I won't go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I had reservations. I always have reservations. So when I arrived and was told to wait for nearly eight minutes, squeezed in a very narrow entrance with a dozen other patrons, my patience grew ever thinner.  I was situated immediately outside of the kitchen, which I found to be a pleasant spot actually. But after I examined the floor plan of the restaurant, I came to the conclusions that there possibly could not be a undesirable table throughout the entire place. This was smart decorating, and such ambiance is a very difficult achievement.  Also, it's one of the few restaurants I've visited where the lighting was actually just the right temperature. It complimented the space, and the food that was to come. I am beginning to forgive the initial wait upon arrival.  It was myself, and two lady friends. One my best friend, the other a complete trollop. they were both dressed fabulously.  I honestly don't remember what we ordered, and frankly, my reviews isn't focused on food. The best food is always home cooked. For me, going to restaurant is about the company, the environment, and the service. What I do remember is that the food is alright, and it won't get anymore than an alright from me. The highlight of the night is when my spice craving friend repeatedly ordered so much hot sauce for her mango shrimp, the chef, and both of the owners came out in utter astonishment in the amount of red goo she was applying to her entrée. Which led to an awkward conversation between us and the restaurant staff.   Linda Restaurant, it's like waking up after a heavy night of partying, turning to your side and finding a stranger, but not feeling the need to sneak out."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Linda Modern Thai because we saw online that this restaurant is rated 3 stars. This restaurant is definitely not worth the 3 start rating due to it's poor customer service. My friend ordered off of the Summerlicious menu and I ordered off the regular menu. First of all, it took 15 minutes for our soft drinks (Pepsi) to come to our table. Then it took another 45 minutes for our food to come. The food we got was nothing what we ordered. The waitress said we would need to wait another half an hour for our food to come again due to the kitchen being so busy. I asked for the bill for the drinks, 2 soft drinks came to $6.25 itself."}
{"text":"Date: Feb 10th, 2012  I was just at Shops at Don Mills this evening with two other female friends and we decided to stop by Linda's around 6pm. We entered the place, beautiful decor & all, and were told that everything is booked and it would take about 40 minutes to seat us. I said, that's pretty crazy for 6pm on a Friday and we said we wouldn't wait around since there are plenty of places around to eat.   Left and sat in the car thinking of where to eat, since it was chillier than usual. I thought, let's call the Bier Market to see if they have space instead of walking there, called them - they had space. I thought why not call Linda's and see if my trick would work..  Called up Linda's and told the receiving end that we're driving there right now and will be there in 5 minutes and asked if they had a table, SURPRISE SURPRISE - \"yes, we have a table right now\". I am absolutely ashamed that this restaurant exists - why decline customers that are clearly looking to spend money on a dinner and then accept otherwise. I told the lady, that I was just in there and you declined us.   This is the epitome of terrible customer service, and is just a mind bogglingly stupid decision on their part. First, declining three paying customers AT THE DOOR claiming it's too busy and then saying it's not to people who weren't even there yet and for all you know, might not even come? How does that make any logical sense whatsoever?  RUDEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. never again."}
{"text":"I went here for the first legit meal after getting my tonsils removed... maybe I was delusional and craved real food too much... but it was excellent.  Joking, the food was good. It wasn't my illusion.  My friend had a chicken curry. The curry was decent but she said it would've been better if she picked seafood instead of the chicken. It would've brought out the taste a bit more.   I think I ordered the mango shrimp, or was it? It was crispy, lightly battered shrimp. It looked pretty on the plate and tasted great. Portions were good as well.  I enjoyed the atmosphere and interior!"}
{"text":"*3.5 Stars*  Came here for an early dinner before going to watch American Sniper - 5pm and the restaurant was blissfully empty.  My parents and I only came here once many years ago and we didn't have such a great experience. Seating was tight and the food was kind of \"Chinese-y\" if that makes any sense. Even more so that my dad, who based on that experience, felt like coming to Linda's for \"Hainan Chicken Rice...?!?!?!?!?\" LOL! (On that note, I don't think Linda's ever served that dish, but just goes to show you our thought process...)  We decided to order:  1. A mild Curry (green) with tofu - YUMMMMMMM! 2. Chicken with Bak Choy and Veggies - delightfully light and healty 3. Fish grilled in banana leaf - although it was good, I usually like my whole fish fried which probably isn't the healthiest but this was still good 4. 2 Tom Yum Gongs just for my dad who said the soup was delish  Each of the main courses came with rice and we were so hungry we polished EVERYTHING off. All three of us got a Lemon Grass tea (teabag) - I highly recommend this tea as it's so wonderfully perfumed with the Lemongrass. Your tea comes in a Frenchpress tea pot and hot water refills are always available.  Had a vastly different, and great, experience this time but I think it was because on a Monday night at 5pm, we had the whole restaurant to ourselves. Seating is a bit tight and probably can get kind of suffocating...but there are lots of nooks and crannies for individual table seating. Those are probably highly coveted so reservations are obviously required.  We had a lovely waitress so no complaints there. I think Linda is a great \"Asian\" option in this area amidst the Italian and American restaurants here."}
{"text":"Service was pretentious, food wasn't good enough to back it up.  Food: 1/5 Not authentic Thai food.  Service: 1/5 Unwelcoming and annoyed Environment: 4/5 Dim quiet and elegant. Washrooms: 4/5 Clean and decorated. Worth it?: 1/5 Not enjoyable.  We were (un)welcomed with a host who was angry (snotty and condescending) with us for not making a reservation for 8 on a Wednesday night while they were 10% full and not busy at all for the entire time we were there. Food did come out in a timely manner.  Pad Thai was overly sour and curry was overly sweet. Not as authentically Thai as they lead you to believe. Thai coffee is not pressed appropriately and water drips too fast leading to a watery coffee. Very disappointed with the meal.  Decor is nice and has a dimly lit dining room.   Would not recommend as there are much better Thai options. Will never return."}
{"text":"$25 summerlicious menu-4 courses  I was here this past weekend for a birthday dinner. I like the way tables are separated by beams and dividers, it gives each party a sense of privacy. Another neat feature is the wooden pieces on the walls. My favorite was the statue of Buddha in the middle. I really enjoyed just looking around.  It is a bit loud but that's expected on a Saturday night @ 9.  The food:  To start we both got the shrimp skewers and i got the tom yum soup and my boyfriend got the mango salad. Nothing spectacular but good. For mains, he got the fried chicken and peanut sauce. The sauce had a hint of wasabi which gave it a nice kick. I got the salmon with broccoli and a soy reduction sauce. The salmon was good and moist. I didn't need the sauce cause I got it overpowered the taste of the salmon.  For dessert I got the fried bananas and honey. It was ok. He got the mango sticky rice...uhhh it was ok.  The drinks were good, I got the basil lemon martini. Yummy! Someone else got a mango martini that tasted like mangos!  If I was just rating the food if give it a 3 cause it was a tad salty and it didn't wow me. But the service was great. My bf dad has strict dietary needs and they were so accommodating that the made something specially for him. We totally forgot and didn't even let the staff know in advance but our waitress was great. Plus the décor and ambiance was great. We love the location. And overall it was a great experience."}
{"text":"I went during winterlicious. The food was amazing, our server was extremely accomodating. I will definitely be repeating"}
{"text":"Oh man... Last night was the forth or fifth visit to Linda. We thought Linda was great enough so that we decided to bring my daughter's teach and her family for a dinner. But, it was such a great disappointment that I would have give a zero star if there is an option here.   So we were up for a summerlicious last night and I did preview the menu which looks perfectly fine to me. As Linda is knows as Thai restaurant, we mainly ordered curry dishes that is the curry pineapple smoked duck. That thing was literally in room temperature which I assumed they prepared them way advance of order? Tom Yum Talay, the soup, was purely about saltiness and it missed the texture of different spiciness which I would expect. To be fair, the seafood inside the soup were decent. We had Tom Yum soup back in 2015 summerlicious which was impressive. Bangkok Fried Chicken, which is an alternative main course option for dinner, was... no better than Popeyes except thinner layer of the bread crumbs. Where did the Bangkok element come out from it? Finally it comes the Crispy Duck Leg that is from the regular menu. It was terrible last night in terms of plain tasting and I guess they forgot to season it? The duck leg was again, not at its freshest taste. Nothing went right about the food except Riceberry Pudding, the dessert! By the way, the duck leg was a WOW back in 2016 when I brought my mom there.  Last but not least, I don't think it's a good idea for a waitress to argue with a customer so badly. When we were asking about anything is good for kids (non-spicy), our waitress recommended the Pad Thai which we had tried a couple times before. We said we don't like the taste because that's way too sweet even taste like it's been putting syrup. She defended the restaurant by saying we couldn't say something like that to them (for ruining their dedication for choosing ingredient?). I mean, we have our own opinion and it's our freedom to speak out. That's the feedback from a customer which you might want to talk to your chief or at least, be humble! Since we are a group of 10 people, the 15% gratuity was charged regardless. Well, I did pay whatever they charged. But hey, it's going to be my last visit and I won't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I had crispy beef with green curry and it was absolutely amazing. The restaurant is on the pricier side, but it definitely worth extra money. Lunch portion was very generous. Highly recommended. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Good luck waiting 45 mins for appetizer, yet another 45 mins for entree, and another 45 mins for dessert. Currently writing this as I wait for my food as a table of two. Nobody came to check up on us during the entire wait time. Nobody is actually in sight to help us out. So far appetizer and entree turned out pretty good tasting. Not sure if it was cause I was super hungry waiting though."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place years ago, finally tried the prix fixe menu for $25 for dinner the past weekend. It wasn't the worst Thai food, but it didn't really impress me either.  Thai food is one of my favourite cuisines. I tried the appetizer of calamari- which was good and flavourful. I tried the Penang chicken curry- a red curry spicy sauce topped with grilled chicken, it came with rice. Packed with flavour and a punch of heat as I requested.  My friends Thai basil tofu looked very underwhelming, just the deep fried tofu You buy at the supermarket sitting a top of a sauce and Bok Choy. Not impressive. I've seen and tasted better.  The dessert I had the fried bananas which was timbit shaped banana bites with a honey sauce- it didn't come with any ice cream or whipped cream as I expected. This is one of my most favourite 'Thai desserts' and I sorely missed the ice cream.  The waitress was incredibly polite and attentive and accommodated substituting chicken for the beef  for us as we don't eat red meat.   I would come here if I'm in the area but won't drive out to it. But am still on the hunt for really good Thai food!"}
{"text":"Tried Linda's for summerlicious and was quite disappointed. Service was lacking and food was bland. I checked out the photos from previous patrons on yelp and noticed they scaled back on the portions for the summerlicious menu. Definitely disappointed and won't be coming back. I would honestly avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight, no reservations and had to wait 5 or 10 mins before seating.    Food: me and my boyfriend order pad Thai and crispy duck which is similar to Peking duck. Once the order arrived I'd have to say I'm not all that impressed. The crispy duck ruined the taste of Peking duck, nothing close to similarity and left it tasting like fried chicken. The pad Thai is nothing to rave bout either.   Overpriced and service wasn't the greatest. Next time you want Thai I suggest somewhere else. Thai iced tea wasn't the greatest either."}
{"text":"decided to update my review to a 4 star. The service was so great. We had a very nice waitress and she was very attentive. She split our food for us at the end of the night equally which saved us the trouble of having to do it. I had the apple cider with alcohol and itwas really warm. It could probably cure whatever cold you have. But it's more of an after dinner drink. The spring rolls we had to start were nice with a peanut sauce but nothing life changing. I've had better ones at Thai express at the mall. I got the crispy beef panang curry again and it was just as good. Probably my fav thai dish. We also got the Islamic noodles and they were amazing. I love saucy noodles and it was perfectly spiced. We got the beef in the Chili sauce which I did not like. It was way too chewy and too much fat on it. Definitely make reservations here because it is super small."}
{"text":"Came here for a group dinner but was disappointed with not only the food but also the service. Immediately upon arrival the host was snippy because we hadn't made a reservation for 10 people. While I understand that having notice is important and sometimes crucial on a busy night, the restaurant was not busy at all and could have accommodated a table of 10. In addition, our server kept rushing us to order drinks/food and was not pleasant at all. At the end of our meal, I had asked for a to go container but they didn't bring it to the table at all.   The food was subpar. With the amount of selection for Thai food in Toronto there are definitely better choices. The food is overpriced in comparison to other places that offer cheaper prices with better flavor. I ordered the red Curry with chicken and the chicken while good was pretty plain. The curry was soupy and I was hoping there would be strong flavour to make up for the somewhat bland chicken. The spice level was also inconsistent across all the dishes ordered even though they were all \"level 3\" some were not spicy while others were over spiced.   The crispy beef red curry was also okay. The beef was dry. I liked the curry spice level 1 better for this dish and thought it was good but nothing special.   Overall, it's a good place to come if you want to eat in a fancy environment but if you're coming for true Thai food, you might be disappointed. However, as I mentioned before, there are other Thai restaurants in Toronto that I would gladly visit (with better service) before coming back here."}
{"text":"I still LOVE the crispy duck! I've even converted one of my companions to come back for it with the hubby.  I love how we don't have to ask for more rice. It really is limitless.  The chef makes his rounds non-intrusively table to table to see if his guests are enjoying their food. How thoughtful.  A great place to catch up with friends for hours. Our water glasses never saw empty and the waitress went unnoticed each time she came by our table to ensure they were bottomless. Our wine glasses however, eventually did see empty.  I'll be back soon... and if he's good, I'll bring the bf and intro him to the crispy duck."}
{"text":"Linda's is no longer above Salad King...i could not understand where they said it moved to.  None the less...i ate at Salad King.  Decent prices decent food.  Decent energy..."}
{"text":"Go to Linda's for the curry and the sheer heat of their delicious Thai offerings.  I don't know much about curries, but I have to say that their curries taste the closest to what I've had in Thailand.  The duck red curry serviced with rice ($21) is such an incredible dish.  Juicy, thick slices of duck breast cooked to perfection is served in a beautiful red curry filled with bamboo and peppers.  For the spice lovers, the spiciness level of almost every dish can be adjusted to meet your tolerance.  Choose from level 1 to 20.  The server told us that level 10 is considered suicide hot.  My hubby decided on 15 for his pad thai and our friend got suckered into a 20.  Red faces and profuse sweating followed.  Hubby declared that this is one of the few places that satisfies his craving for really hot things.  I declared that there is no kissing until lips are thoroughly cleaned and rinsed.  The atmosphere is dark with attempts at creating a Thai atmosphere with a fake idol and carved wooden panels.  The service was excellent and fast.  When our group of 8 steadily grew by ones and twos into 14, the servers kept their humour and found us an extra table and squeezed more chairs into our cozy alcove.    While I much prefer the prices of the parent Salad King downtown, I would come back just for the duck red curry."}
{"text":"Service was great! The Ambiance is perfect for a Thai restaurant. The mango salad bloody amazing. I really wanted the red curry muscles.... but they run out of muscles. What the heck. How do you run out? Do buy more."}
{"text":"you have to order the crispy beef panang curry. SOOOOO good!  the portion is huge and comes with a bowl of rice.  The curry itself is amazing and not too spicy and the beef is tender on the inside and has a light crispy outside.  i can't get myself to try any of the other mains!  for apps i've tried their mango salad (note that there's coriander in it, which I hate and mint leaves which I also don't like), beef satay (not bad), and their fried calamari (I would get this again and loved the honey chili dipping sauce it came with).  desserts I've tried their mango sticky rice (the mango was not sweet and really hard) and their deep fried banana with honey (just standard).    the decor here is super cool and there's a nice patio area for the summer, I love this place!"}
{"text":"Went for a birthday dinner with my uncle's family and we all loved it!  The decor and ambiance are very classy with Buddhist sculptures and beautiful orchids.  We had the Thai Islamic noodles (yum!), spicy Shrimp and Green curry chicken.  All the dishes were perfectly portioned for the three of us (we did family style) and quite delicious.   The Islamic noodles was the most popular among us., slightly sweet and just moist enough.   We ordered the seafood soup for my little cousin, but that did not seem (or taste) too appetizing.  For dessert, we had the crispy mango roll and the chocolate burst-not bad either.  The price did not seem unreasonable for the quality of food.  Our server was quite efficient and friendly as well.  We had made a reservation online, so they seated us in a private nook near the corner.  It was quite cozy.  I also noticed that there are other similar private seating areas both for small and large groups.  The restaurant is not too big and looked quite busy during the weekend, but service was quick and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Was really impressed by the decor and service. Nice quiet cozy place. They have a simple menu so there isnt ALOT of choices but that just makes life more easier! We had the Crispy Beef Panang Curry (which tasted like not nothing we have tried before-crispy outside and THE softest beef EVER) and the Chicken Royal Pad Thai which was a bit sweet and really good as well. We asked for extra peanut sauce on the side. The meal went great with Thai Iced Tea which tasted authentic. All in all-it was a great experience."}
{"text":"I've been to Linda's twice. Each time it's been consistently good food -- the short ribs, the panang crusted beef, panang chicken, straw mushrooms, it's all been good.  That said, the prices are fairly steep for the area, and perhaps more expensive than the food is good. That's a personal choice, but it does keep me from going here too frequently.  The service has always been friendly, but each time it's been pretty slow.  Don't bother with espresso here -- they have a machine, but they basically don't know how to use it, and it's too expensive given the lack of espresso skill."}
{"text":"Went to Linda's today for lunch,didn't know winterlicious was on.  The greeter did tell us ahead of time and that regular menu selection was limited.   Servers in general were very pleasant and very quick to help out and refill the water (even though it was very busy)  I decided to try the winterlicous menu, which was reasonably priced at $18  I had some Thai sausage appetizer, the flavour was great, and the food temperature let me know it was just made.   The portion though was a little scarce.   It was a sausage about 5 cm long cut diagonally into 4 pieces.  My friend had the fried ribs, which looked good, better size portion, but being fried, didn't expect it to be cold and a bit soggy (probably sitting there for a while).     My main was the chicken curry.   The dice was nice, but had only 5 thin pcs of an already small chicken.  Had to really portion the meat to rice ratio.  Dessert was a bit of a savior to the meal, I had a trifle with fruit.  Once again tiny portion, but good flavour and quite refreshing.  Overall, the place looks really nice, but was not wowed by the food or the portion sizes."}
{"text":"Yes, it is a little bit overpriced. Except for that, it is really a good place to hang out with friends and the food is great there. I'm a big fan of the exotic Asian style decor and the staff is all very friendly and nice.  We ordered a small fried calamari as the appetizer which is surprisingly tender. The taste is quite crunchy and flavourful.  The crispy beef curry comes with a strong and authentic Thai-style curry flavor. It goes well with the steamed rice. perfect match! The texture of the beef looks like a beef stew but wrapped with a crispy puff pastry. Very interesting.   Tha Royal Pad Thai is covered with an egg wrap, with peanuts at the top. It is a little bit sour for me. Overall taste good."}
{"text":"We came all the way from downtown and got really hungry on DVP.  So we got off on Don Mills Road North and passed by a great shopping plaza like Downtown Toronto. Our car entered into the streets and amazed of how CF mall created such a downtown like outdoor mall. :) We parked in a free parking building provided by CF mall and walked toward the core of the plaza.  The first restaurant appears to us was Linda Modern Thai Restaurant, so there we go.   We were placed in a table at central where the beautiful piece of 'god' portrait is located.  What a tourist feeling of being in Thailand Temples as if I was visiting a famous temple once in Bangkok.    We ordered three items 1. Whole Fried Fish 2. Tom Yum Soup  3. Bangkok Stir Fry  See attached pictures. Our server was good and attentive to our thirst. She kept refilling our water. The food quality, tastes and cooking skills are outstanding.  The great compliment goes to the chef who cooked our fish, it was de-boned and perfectly cooked without drying the fish.  This process is very special and well controlled. Fried fish without dehydrating the fish meat itself. Wonderful fish, we have to give a thumb up, make it 2!!!  The only feedback for them is to improve the choice of shrimp used in the soup, the shrimps were well cleaned (no intestines) but not crunchy. I expected the freshness in shrimps appear crunchy and no shrimp tastes. Perhaps the frozen shrimps?   Having said that. Overall we give positive review with 4 stars and thumb up to the chef who cooked the fish wonderfully tasteful!!!!  Bon appetites we surely had :)"}
{"text":"Mmm Thai Food.. I first walked into the restaurant thinking, \"Well this is fancy!\".  It was supposed to be a casual dinner after I finished work, but I'm not complaining.  They had very nicely decorated Asian inspired furniture as well as a gold temple with a Buddha in the center of the restaurant.  Once everyone arrived at the restaurant, we were greeted by a very friendly Korean waitress.  She was very knowledgeable about the menu and she described everything in detail, from the taste to the texture of everything we asked.   She was also able to recommend a lot and suggest what dish goes best with which meat.  You are also able to personalize how many chilli peppers you would like for each dish.  Looking through the menu, there was so much to choose from.. we all decided to pick one appetizer and one main dish.  We started off with the Mieng Kum (which was Linda's signature appetizer meaning \"many things in one bite\").  It definitely was.. you eat it with a piece of Mieng Kum leaf imported straight from Thailand and take a spoonful of each ingredient, such as shallots, coconut shavings, fresh green chilli peppers, limes, roasted peanuts, and small dried shrimps.  Then you wrap it like you would a taco and take a bite.  The first bite, it was kind of interesting, the texture was crunchy with a bit of sweetness and saltiness.  None the less, I definitely went for seconds.  We also tried their Pla Meuk Tod (fried calamari with a honey chilli dipping sauce).. those are to die for! One of the best calamari's I've had. And lucky for us, we got the last batch of calamari because they were sold out afterwards. And finally the last appetizer we decided to choose was the Tom Yum Goong (hot and sour shrimp soup), which was also very delicious and flavourful.  Now onto the main dishes.  We ordered the Royal Pad Thai with chicken, Thai Islamic Noodles with shrimp, and the Seafood Fried Rice.  The Royal Pad Thai was not your typical pad thai.. it was wrapped in what looked like a crêpe and all the stuffing was inside.  The Islamic Noodles came with a side of curry sauce that was poured over the noodles to give it a nice creamy texture.  This dish was my favourite among the three, although a little on the salty side.  The Seafood Fried Rice was okay, it came with calamari, mussels, and shrimps.  Pretty self-explanatory, nothing special in terms of fried rice.  Lastly, we finished with a Mango Sticky Rice.  Usually, I'm a huge fan of the Mango Sticky Rice, as I've had it at another restaurant that is my all time favourite. But this time.. I wasn't too fond of it.  It came with some pieces of fresh strawberries and some crushed up peanuts on top of the mango sticky rice.  All in all, I did enjoy my first experience at Linda Modern Thai and I'd definitely come back, although it is a bit pricey, but it's also because of the area the restaurants' located. But being as my other half is Thai and having being introduced to authentic Thai food, nothing compares and it's hard to say that any Thai food is better than authentic home-made Thai food."}
{"text":"Great food good ambiance. It gets pretty crowded in there for dinner and it's a bit on the expensive side. The mieng Kum appetizer is unique and great. Definitely something different than you're average spring roll or chicken satay so give it a try.   The Atlantic scallops were a bit over cooked, but still tasty and the panang curry is awesome."}
{"text":"This is my favorite thai restaurant in Toronto. It's classy and authentic.   Panang curry with crispy beef. That's all I have ever ordered and it's heavenly. The beef is so nicely cooked and the genius of it's crispy texture goes so well with the complex sauce it bathes in.   It is in my opinion the best restaurant at shops at don mills(yes i have tried them all). And makes for a perfect date location because of the nice walks possible in the summer, free parking, and proximity to a very nice movie theater."}
{"text":"This was the first time we tried Lindas Thai, and thought we would try their winterlicious menu. We had heard such great thing but was extremely disappointed. the appetizers were okay, but one of the parties ordered the soup and it was smaller than a tea cup. When we complained about our disappointment and asked for another option the manager explained that because there wasn't anything wrong with the food it couldn't be changed. When our mains came the presentation was far from mediocre, especially given the prices. But it was the taste that set us to complain again. Two of us ordered the mushroom Thai basil dish but It was so salty and only tasted of stock (or the knor powder). It had Zero flavour of basil and lacked anything exciting. It was so bad neither one of us could eat it. The manager was a lot nicer and offered to exchange it for a better dish, the curry chicken. It was good but because the chef probably rushed the order the vegetables were uncooked, it wasnt a delight to get a big mouth full of raw onion. But I wasn't about to complain again, I just wanted to get my dining experience over with. Definitely not return."}
{"text":"after eating dinner at Linda,s modern thai last night, I would not  refer anyone who like,s good thai food to go there.the food is plan ,and the portions are very small, well the price,s are high. dinner with two dish,s and a small salad was around seventy five dollar,s.we had to pick up food on the way home as we were still  not full.there are so many better thai place,s in Toronto."}
{"text":"Linda's is one of those fancy restaurants done right. One reason I rarely go to \"fancy\" restaurants is because usually it feels like a rip off. You pay a large premium for good service and decor but the food is mediocre and small portion. Linda's is my definition of a GOOD fancy restaurant: Authentic food, moody atmosphere, and attentive service.   We had the seafood curry baked in a coconut and the Pad Thai. Both were excellent and tasted authentic. You can ask for different levels of spiciness for the curry. I like how it's cooked in a coconut. You can eat the coconut meat too with some scooping! The Pad Thai is covered with a layer of egg which looks pretty cool. Linda's doesn't skimp on ingredients.  Shrimp Pad Thai has tons of shrimp and decent sized ones too. The flavor on the Pad Thai is much better than what I've experienced at many other places. Some places make it taste like ketchup. Some places even make it sour. Linda's has the best Pad Thai I've had that I can recall.  This is one of the few places where I feel the higher prices are well justified. $17 for Pad Thai and $21 for curry. That's about 70-80% more expensive than most places. Generally I don't like to spend too much on food but for this place I can make an exception."}
{"text":"As a frequent brunch go-er, sometimes menus can get boring.  I mean sure, eggs are versatile, but Hollandaise sauce gets kind of boring after awhile.  So when Linda Modern Thai invited me to preview their new brunch menu, both my bored palate and I were excited!  Traditional brunch items get made over with a Thai twist.  Eggs Benedict gets reinvented; their famed Panang curry replacing the classic Hollandaise, topped with smoked duck breast which is tailor made for Linda by King Cole.  The whole shebang is served on a butter brioche from Mabel's Bakery in Parkdale.  Curry?  Sounds like it'd be a much heavier substitute for an already-rich Hollandaise right?  Nope - it is surprisingly light and leaves room for the bounty of sides that come with all brunch entrées which include your choice of:  Mango Salad/Homefries/Congee ---and-- Bread or Thai Donut Fritter --and-- Sangkaya  The Thai dough fritter (pathongko) is a misnomer.  It refers to white sugar sponge cake which was often sold by street vendors, together with dough fritters.  The names of both were often shouted aloud.  Unfortunately, the sponge cake wasn't so popular among the Thai, but the name stuck.  On the sweeter side of things is the Roti Gulay (Thai Banana Egg Pancake), which is closer to a crêpe than actual roti which pockets peanuts, coconut and banana inside and is lightly drizzled with condensed milk.  Breakfast beverage options come in the form of Doi Chang Coffee or Thai Tea as well as a selection of cocktails and mocktails.  Brunch is served on Saturdays and Sundays from 11AM to 3PM.  Reservations are recommended."}
{"text":"I was at the Shops at Don Mills with my mom and came here for lunch. I love Thai food, but this place was just average for me. The interior is dimly lit with pictures of Buddha on the walls and deep black and red colours.   To start, we shared an appetizer plate, which consisted of tender chicken lemongrass skewers with sweet peanut sauce, fresh shrimp, thinly sliced beef, and mediocre spring rolls. We weren't particularly wowed by the selection of appetizers. As they were quite filling, we decided to share our main course, which was the rice noodles with chicken and panang curry sauce. The panang sauce was mild and tangy. The food was just mediocre for me and the prices were quite steep, as well.   Our hostess also doubled as our server and she provided great service."}
{"text":"Pricey, but excellent quality for very good Thai food, I would rate it high quality Thai, beautiful restaraunt, good staff, will eat there again."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed with this restaurant. I used to come here all the time with my fiancé, probably 7 years or so, and every time it used to be feel like a Thai food experience.   As of our last visit, they have chosen to revamp the menu. They removed the sesame seed chocolate ball dessert and replaced it with cheesecake and funnel cakes.. None of which are Thai specific desserts nor do they taste anything like a Thai experience. I feel they are seriously trying to accommodate the Canadian culture by sacrificing their original roots, Thai food! I will not be visiting again, let alone recommend the place.   Menu is 4/10 at best, dessert 1/10. Service is still great but tons of other authentic places that are true to their origins. Disappointed Linda's, really disappointed."}
{"text":"I had the Thai Islamic Noodles with shrimp ($19), really yummy! Like others have stated, it would've been nice if there was extra sauce but this dish in itself is a solid 4.5 stars for me. Would be a 5 if there was extra curry sauce and maybe if it was chicken AND shrimp rather than just one. I would come back for this.   My boyfriend had the green curry with chicken ($16). This one... not so great. The chicken was really bland, and it had a really interesting/weird soft texture. It is cooked separately from the curry and is just place on top of the sauce, giving it no curry flavour at all. The green curry was ok, but not super flavourful and I would not order that again.   The experience was nice. The decor of this place is beautiful and really fun. We came at a non-busy time, around 5pm or so, hence being the only ones we had really great service. This place is a bit pricy though for what is it. I wouldn't mind coming back but probably won't be a frequent visitor. It is worth a try though if you're considering! Get the Thai Islamic Noodles!"}
{"text":"Last night was the first time we tried Linda's. Wasn't expecting much, but when we walked in we were greeted with such friendly staff. The decor was lovely, beautiful Thai statues and we got the semi private group table by the bar.  Had the fresh young coconut water right out of the coconut with all the the yummy coconut flesh. That was delicious, just like being on the beach!  We had the crispy beef panang curry.  The curry sauce was amazing.  Also had the seafood curry coconut.  Sauce a little sweeter but loved it.   Our friend had the market fish with red curry wrapped in banana leaf.  All of the dishes were spot on with the right taste, sweetness, and spice.  By dessert I was so full but couldn't resist the deep fried bananas with lychee and pineapple ice cream.  Big enough portion for two of us to share.  The banana was perfect. Just the right ripeness and sweetness drizzled with honey and sesame seeds.  My friends and I loved this place and will definitely come here again.  Top stars for service, atmosphere, and most important of all flavour."}
{"text":"Usually don't write reviews, but this place is so lacking that I was obliged to write one. I eat at cheap and pricey places alike so my expectations vary with the restaurant.   First time diner at Linda. Let's just say, my $9 chicken and shrimp pad thai (with free drink) I'm currently eating at a cheap chinese diner, is closer to real pad thai I've had in Thailand, then the $18 shrimp one I had at Linda (which was tasteless, dry, overcooked, have they even heard of tamarind?)  Don't even want to mention the other dishes I had here. Cold soup (tom yum is laughable), green curry did not taste like curry, \"smoked duck\" tastes like the one I get from a bag at Loblaws (also overcooked to ****). Spent $200, felt like I got robbed.   Honestly don't even know why people come here.   One star only cause the server was very friendly."}
{"text":"Ate here tonight with a reservation at 6pm. Our server, Steven, was excellent. However we had some major disappointments with our overall experience. My mom had a cocktail and ordered the $25 summerlicious menu (shrimp satay, bass fish, custard) and I ordered the pad Thai and spring rolls off their a la carte menu. Our server was great and went to double check with the manager regarding food ingredients, as my mother has food allergies.  Disappointingly, after reassuring us that the items she had ordered were safe, her appetizer came out with cucumber (what she is allergic to) as a garnish, which was touching her food. Not impressed. She ended up eating part of my appetizer and I ate her parts that were touching the cucumber.  Another issue we had was that I had asked for tea but it was never brought out. Lastly - and the last straw for us: I only ate half of my ($18!) pad Thai and asked for the other half to go, the manager (a man with a nice purple dress shirt and tie) ended up tossing it out!! He was barely apologetic and offered to replace it but we were unable to wait (as service was also incredibly slow this evening - I.e. Waiting 25 min for mains). What was disappointing was the fact that nothing was done to reflect the multiple issues we experienced tonight.  No one came by to rectify it and we were still charged the full amount for everything. The only reason I gave this place 2 stars was that the actual food itself was decent - but we were extremely disappointed and probably won't be back due to the poor customer service by management."}
{"text":"Another wonderful meal at Linda's.  I had the salmon which was cooked perfectly.  I loved the grilled vegetables too.  Try the spicy pear tea for a treat :)"}
{"text":"Came here for the 1st time for a team lunch with my coworkers. The venue is nice and the restaurant looks upscale, but the quality of the food was so so. I had a Ginger Julep (with alcohol) which was refreshing. Couldn't tell you how much it cost because our boss paid for everything which made the whole dining experience a little more positive.  We also ordered an assortment of appetizers, skewers, shrimp etc... presentation was basic and for my main I had the homemade Panang Curry. I asked for mild but it was actually pretty spicy which is one thing I'll never understand.  Why does a meal have to be overloaded with spice? And I mean \"hot\" spice not the flavourful kind which I can appreciate. I like to actually taste what I'm eating and not have to worry about putting out the flame in my mouth.  Presented with my curry was a simply chicken breast sliced on an angle and plopped on the side of the plate. Again, pretty basic presentation.  In my opinion, I think Linda's is overrated but I've definitely had worse.   On a positive, the restaurant was pretty quiet for a Thursday lunch crowd (which I like), not packed which was surprising. Our waiter was nice too, a little overcompensating on the \"trying to be funny\" but nevertheless friendly."}
{"text":"Huge headache and minor tongue swelling from this Thai food. I never get that reaction from Thai restaurants unless mega preservatives/MSG. so something was not on the level here."}
{"text":"A beautiful, well appointed restaurant with great presentation of food, and good service. It earned its two stars for the aforementioned pluses. It gets zero stars for its food. The taste of the food was truly distasteful. When a restaurant has a small menu like this restaurant, one expects awesome food. Overall, I, nor the people that dined with me, would never return."}
{"text":"My friend and i enjoyed our first experience here.  the panang curry was amazing.  the flavour and spice was delicious. i got the tofu paneng and she got the beef.  the service was extremely friendly at the bar as well as the other servers were very bice too.  staff was attentive and courteous and i personally enjoyed the atnsoohere.  the lights were too dark, and the decor was appropriate.  happy to have had my first experience here be a good one."}
{"text":"When my beloved Salad King burnt to the ground last summer I decided to check out Linda as its \"please god have siam noodes\" equivalent.  Not only did they NOT have Siam noodles, the service was snail paced slow, the waitress forgot our water and our spring rolls, the portions vs price were underwhelming and the experience was tasteless and expensive.   Plus to top it off it was unseasonably cold that night and we were stuck on the patio for 1.5 hours waiting for spring rolls.   Step it up Linda, for the price and for being Salad King's sister restaurant I expected much more."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday lunch and was sorely disappointed. The service was lacking, and the food was below average and over-priced to say the least.   We ordered a Lobster Bisque, Mango Salad and Chicken Satay to start. The Lobster Bisque (which was about 4 tablespoons of soup) smelled so fishy and tasted even worse. I will go as far as saying that it tasted nothing like a lobster bisque and was the worst lobster bisque I have ever had.   The Mango Salad and Chicken Satay were actually not bad. Saving graces of the meal to be honest!  We order Beef Panang Curry but they gave us something else that had a curry but deep fried beef- which is apparently their signature dish. It was OK. Nothing special. Also ordered the Lamb and it was just ok, no curry and came with a really average peanut sauce.  Overall the meal was disappointing and not cheap. If you want good thai food, go for Salad King or Khao San Road (or Mengrai if looking for something fancy)."}
{"text":"Last time, I wrote a glowing review of Linda Modern Thai.  Let me tell you this: I'm not a happy customer - and I don't like writing scathing reviews. As a frequent customer of Linda Modern Thai, I'm rarely disappointed except for this time.  Apparently, Linda Modern Thai has changed the menu. I was not impressed with the selection. The golden lamb curry was no longer on the menu.  The service was extremely slow. My friend and I waited a good 20 minutes for service. We just sat there and no one came to get our orders. I was shocked! Finally, our server came over and told us she was new. I don't fault her for that. She was very nice. I think it was management's fault for not hiring enough servers as it was a busy Saturday night. I don't like waiting long for my food.  But that was not the end of it. I ordered the Bangkok Fried Hen and it came out less than stellar. I didn't bother taking a picture of my dish like I always do because presentation was severely lacking. The fried hen was served on top of a banana leaf in a metal tray with a bowl of soup on the side. Honestly, the whole dish looked disgusting. The black bean sauce was too salty and when combined with the saltiness of the hen, I felt like I was tasting metal. The hen tasted ordinary like Popeye's Chicken. I prefer a sweeter sauce to counter the saltiness. I've made fried chicken before and it never came out like this.  So this experience at Linda Modern Thai was a huge letdown. I expected more."}
{"text":"Flank beef was plain (the soup smells weird) and fried seafood was too sweet and oily and I asked for wedges of lemon and it took 20 mins, should have grabbed some at the bar myself.  There must be something wrong with the red sauce (I wouldn't call it syrup since it didn't taste sweet at all) on pineapple/mange (?) Popsicle, it's salty and sour I think they put salt instead of sugar if it's house-made syrup. I asked waitress to try one by herself. Crispy beef curry was good as always though.   Been here several times and have tried many items on the menu (there're not many choices though). Crispy beef curry (golden curry of course), traditional appetizer platter (chicken lemon grass sausage-varies- sometimes yummy sometimes really dry, beef satay, and spring rolls are all well made), coconut seafood curry-wow but little pricey , the chicken & vegs rice- you might feel it too sour but I like it- not the chicken though; the steak dish--good, crispy duck leg- no, etc., fresh, nice presentation, and more of the restaurant quality than the Thai eateries we usually go for pad thai, flat rice noodles, one plate meals, which are, obviously not Linda's specialities either. Anyway, nice place to relax if you like."}
{"text":"We found the portions to be quite small, especially for the fish dishes, which were quite small with mostly bone and not much to eat.  The vegetable curry dish was comprised of almost only red and green peppers with a few broccoli florets, and no other vegetables. When we brought the fact that the vegetable dish had very little variety of vegetables, our server responded by looking blankly at us and saying, \"so would anyone like to order desert? We left hungry."}
{"text":"Ambience & decor: ethnic-modern, classy. High ceilings, exquisite works of art, beautiful entrance door, comfy booths & tables. Food & service: courteous & friendly. They have adequate vegetarian choices as lunch specials. My vegetarian vermicelli noodles (Bangkok stir fry) was interestingly presented. The portion sizes are generous & appropriately priced. They include rice with the curries which makes complete sense unlike some places where you have to order rice separately.  Tried the Doi Chaang filter coffee for the first time. It is was very flavorful.  This place deserves a 4 star."}
{"text":"I've been to Linda's twice. The service is consistently great and the food is superb. Go for it."}
{"text":"My impression of this meal is americanized Thai food, that was not that great. We ordered the beef salad, jungle chicken and fried bananas. The beef in the beef salad was average, although the salad itself did taste a little awkward because of the pairings of raw thai basil, cilantro and mint (hard to pickup with a fork too). The jungle chicken was inedible. The rice was so sour, it was like sucking on a lemon. The chicken itself was juicy, but lacked seasoning. The only acceptable thing was the fried bananas (which you really cannot mess up). Service was good, and they said they will relay our complaints to the kitchen, we did not get any discount for our complaints. Pricing for that quality of food was really terrible. You can get better tasting food at a mall food court for a quarter of the price."}
{"text":"I went to Linda's for lunch this year at Summerlicious.   1. Cold Rolls. These were a great first dish, the sauce really helped bring out the flavour of the mango and carrots inside.   2. Quinoa with Duck. This was the big miss of the meal; it's a shame it had to be the main course. The quinoa was quite cold and there was very little duck in the meal. Whatever duck was there was nearly tasteless. I tried a friend's Panang Chicken and it was much better. The curry tasted fantastic.  3. Mango Sticky Rice. This was great - simply a slice of mango on top of sticky rice. Good way to finish off the meal.  Overall I was very happy with the appetizer and dessert, but very disappointed with the quinoa with duck. I probably would've given Linda's 4 stars if I had ordered the Panang Chicken though, that was great. If I were to come back I'd definitely order any dish with their Panang curry."}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Lunch Specialty: Thai Menu items: Shrimp Panang and Golden Curry Chicken  Yes, we all love Thai food. But have you ever wondered if you've really had the best Thai you could ever indulge in? I never did ask myself that...until I went to Linda's Restaurant. Linda is not a friend of mine, Linda is the up and coming restaurant in the newly opened Shops at Don Mills outdoor mall in North Toronto. The sister restaurant of the famous Salad King on Yonge and Dundas, has opened its doors to the North York crowd featuring traditional Thai dishes in a location that could have not been more perfect, with a decor that could have not been more Thai.  Amongst my favourite things to indulge in @ Linda's, is the Shrimp Panang.  Shrimp Panang is a Thai fried curry sauce made with coconut milk, sweet basil and lime leaf, usually topped off with bell peppers, peanuts and chicken, beef or shrimp. The slightly spicy panang sauce (you can customize your spice level) is a sweet tasty sauce that combined with the peppers and a softer meat, like shrimp, makes this dish a delight to eat.  With the curry theme in mind, my next dish on the \"my fav's\" list is the Golden Curry Chicken.This dish is actually the complete opposite, in terms of taste, of a panang sauce. The flavour tends to be on the salty side (not saying it was salty) more so than on the sweet side. Although the golden sauce is actually made with plum sugar, the tamarind sauce that's also used almost overpowers it; and then balances it to ease off the sweetness. I find this interesting as the panang is not sweet at all, yet it has a sweeter taste to it. An interesting take on what sweetness can be...is it an ingredient or its evolution?  Until next time Foodies!  Buen Provecho, Viviana."}
{"text":"Wasn't bad. Good service. Food was pleasant. Good choices of curry. I just wish there was more of an extensive menu. Plus the chairs and tables were meh. Would've expected table cloths utilized at such a restaurant.  But worth a stop if you crave that Thai flav while shopping at the CF Shops of Don Mills!"}
{"text":"If you like a watered down version of Thai soup this is defiantly the best place to have it .  Also we ordered the chicken golden curry ,which the description should have read on the menu as grilled chicken on top of golden curry cause that's exactly what we got . There was sure evidence that the chicken never got cooked right in the curry. We give this top scale sister restaurant to salad King  two thumbs down for the worst disguise on Thai food!!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday. Tried the royal pad thai and crispy beef curry. The crispy beef curry was absolutely delightful - rich and flavourful. It might be a bit too rich for one person to finish the whole dish though, so I would suggest to share the entrees instead. Royal pad thai tasted decent but not outstanding. Will be back to try the rest of the menu!!"}
{"text":"Ambience is beautiful with their ancient asian feel of authenticity. Not too much can be said for the service here. They take a very long time to get to your table but once they're there, they rush you to place your order.  Their saving grace is the crispy beef. Such a wafer-like crispy outer shell to the most juicy, flavorful and tender braised beef inside. They make a mean Caesar too! Try it once. You're welcome."}
{"text":"This is the sister restaurant of Salad King. The food isn't too bad. I got the soft shell crab as an appetizer. The breading was a little too heavy for my liking. I ended up getting the Beef Golden Curry for my main course. I was hoping for a little kick but unfortunetly, there was none. Can't fault them for this though, it didn't say that it would be spicy.   I have to take the stars away because the seating space is tiny and extremely cramped. The way the furniture is positioned, some tables have very little access to get to some of the seats. Some of the seating also makes you feel like you're trapped in a prison cell with the way the furniture is shaped.  They also completely messed up my bill. My tab came out to the high $20's. So I gave them a $50 and they gave me a $5 back. Are you serious. You really expect a $15 tip on a $30 dinner. When I told the waiter, he said that it was the correct change for what I gave him. This got me real mad until the manager had to come and settle it. I ended up getting my correct change but it left a very nasty taste in my mouth.  Overall, the food is good enough that I would go back for the food. However, the service was so horrible the one time I went that I just can't see myself recommending this place to anyone. There are better Thai restaurants in Toronto that will not give you as big of a headache as Linda's."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  It's a bit pricey for Thai food, but the ambience is nice, and the overall decor is also lovely.  The beef curry I think is absolutely amazing, something about a slab of deep fried beef, covered in a succulent curry sauce...yum.  There's an appetizer that's like a beef and lettuce wrap that is also delicious.    I think once Linda herself came out to say hi - she's really lovely.  Eating at Linda's is better than Glow and Joey's in this mall/location. Try it, it's good."}
{"text":"Went for summerlicious 2014. Found most of the items too sweet for my taste. Service was friendly. Overall wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. I was at the patio which was nice that they had one in the summer. I would have given 4 stars if the price point was lower which would increase the satisfaction level overall to make it an average restaurant and more likely for revisiting given there are many choices in the area. The food presentation was pretty and unique though."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner. The dishes came out lukewarm even when the restaurant was not busy at all. The most disappointing part was the server. She was extremely inattentive and kept on messing up our orders. Whenever we asked for something she would always forget and needed to be reminded several times before actually bringing it to our table. She also mixed up two orders and did not even apologize when we addressed the issue to her. Because we came in a large party, we were required to pay a 15% tip. But even after we paid large tips that she did not deserve and asked for to go boxes to pack up our left overs, we still had to remind her three times for the boxes. I am never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Love love love Linda's! It's the upper scale to salad king with of course similar yet different menu. The place is well decorated, which creates a unique ambience. Whenever I go, my usuals are:  Peking duck  Coconut fried rice Curry fish pot Although prices are a tad high, I find their quality and atmosphere worth it."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner 3 times with friends.  I love the interior decoration (very mysterious Asian style)!  The service needs to be more consistent.  It was very welcoming one time but it was inattentive the other time.  I am not a big fan of Thai food but the food there is an ok.  Their signature appetizer - Mieng Kum is certainly very special.  I ordered this appetizer every single time."}
{"text":"Came to Shoppes on Don Mills for a quick look around. And wanted to grab a quick dinner bite to each. Looked their the window of looked dark and I thought it was closed. But then I saw a couple of ppl. Went in no one was at the front desk, peeked in and there was at least 2 staff and 1 bartender standing at the bar staring at me. I said Hi...no response. Than a man in a grey suit greeted us and asked if we made reservations. We said no just walked in. He said he was expecting some tables..and checked his computer. But the restaurant was quite empty when we were there. Asked if we wanted to sit by the window or sit in the dark. So my hubby choose the window.   Ordered a Thai Beer and A Bangkok Lemonade. Thai Beer was mild and the Bangkok Lemonade was quite interesting and refreshing.   Ordered some starters, Beef & Chicken Skewers & Some Sausage Dish. The skewers were good but I liked the chicken one better it was very moist and flavourful. There was also some pickled pink baby radishes on the side too.The Sausage Dish was not bad either. Even though the waitress said not a lot of ppl order that. Had an interesting flavour and came with some pickled onions and shredded cabbage n carrots.   Mains were: Crispy Beef with Trio Curry & Coconut Seafood Curry.  Crispy Beef was interesting...the beef was sort of shredded than mixed with some sort of mixture to stick together and than rolled in a crispy batter and deep fried. But the portion was really small for $20 there was like 5 small pieces. But there was heaps of curry sauces. And 1 small bowl of rice. The curry sauces were really good though. Very flavourful. Hubby had to ordered naan bread on the side to finish up the curries. Their naan was interesting looking, like pita triangles but had a nice flavour to them.  My Coconut Seafood Curry had a nice presentation. It came in a Full Coconut Shell and 1 bowl of rice on the side. The taste of the curry was really good..but the seafood was definitely not fresh. It tasted really fish and mushy. There were mussels, 3 shrimps, calmari rings, maybe 2 itty bitty pieces of salmon, okra slices & 2 cherry tomatoes that were just dunked in last minute.  Also their rice was a bit wet too. But again their curry sauce was good. Just not the rest of the ingredients.  Waitress was also very informative and attentive as well."}
{"text":"Summerlicious Lunch of 2015  For $18 (before tax and tip), you get a 3 course meal with an app, main dish, and dessert. Value alone this was worth it. However, please don't expect authentic thai food and compare it to places like pai or khao san road.  Linda is more of a fusion thai place where western style food meets some thai spices.  Food:   App: Thai sausages - the selection is different each day and today, they had chicken sausages. The portion was good. The sausages had a nice spice to it. The sweet chilli sauce used to dip the sausages was really good. It didn't taste like store-bought so perhaps, it was homemade? B  Main: I got the golden chicken curry and rice, and my partner got the thai tacos.   Golden chicken curry - the portion of this dish was huge, but I wasn't expecting a piece of chicken breast cut up and laid out on top of the curry. Usually the chicken is mixed in with the curry. The dish wasn't bad. The chicken was very tender, which I really enjoyed. The curry itself was missing an authentic thai quality (i cant explain it), but I would say, it definitely felt like a fusion dish to me. I liked it. B+   Thai Tacos - I advise against ordering this. There were three tacos and the ingredients weren't filled to the top. My partner was not full. The taco wraps tasted like they were a day old and from no frills. The filling itself was tasteless. In my opinion, a very poorly made dish - I guess that's what we get for ordering tacos at a thai place! D  Dessert: Panacotta - Very light. I could taste the coconut milk. B  Pandan Custard - I really liked this. The egg custard melted in my mouth. B+  Thai ice tea - definitely was not worth $5. A small glass filled half with ice and not very sweet. C-  Service: Our server was lovely. The thai ice tea took awhile to get to us, but she explained why. The food also took a bit longer to get to us, but our water was always filled and people were always checking on us to make sure we were okay.  Ambience: The place does get an A for decor. It's beautiful inside. I could see people celebrating a special occasion here for the beautiful decor. The food wasn't the best, but perhaps, their regular menu will be better. Personally, I will just stick to Pai the next time I have a thai craving.  Overall, I gave this place a 3. The food was a 2, but the service and ambience brought it up to 3."}
{"text":"Amazing thai food here! The pad thai was great but not too spicy. Try out the green chicken curry, you will not regret it.  Overall experience was good."}
{"text":"Five stars for ambience (hey, it is just beautiful), and two stars for food - averaging at about 3.5 stars.  Seriously, the curries all taste the same and are overly salty.  I had the curry sampler - really it could have been one single curry with different food colorings. The noodles were drowned in sauce which wasn't even that good.  The appys were the best.  I have no complaints about the service, although having in mind that there were only two tables occupied in the entire (large) restaurant - it could have been faster.   So, come here for drinks and appys to impress a date - but skip the main dishes."}
{"text":"Disappointing...  Went to Linda for a very late lunch a few days ago.  Until now, we have always enjoyed our meals at Linda and were very pleased to see their new menus with greater variety.  What we ordered:  Drinks - Lemon basil martinis - these are always excellent at Linda, and we enjoyed them very much.  Crispy Beef Bites (from the dinner appetizer menu) - to share - a fairly small portion, but crispy and tender.  Dip sauces are all sweet; the mango yogurt dip tastes too much like dessert - one savoury dip would be a good idea, perhaps a spicy (curry?) aoli.  Chili orange was the best of the three sauces.  Tom Yum Goong - we invariably order Tom Yum at Thai restaurants; this was a tad overpriced, but nice flavour.  Crispy Duck Leg with Steamed Dumplings - \"steamed dumplings\" is a real misnomer; they are actually a won ton wrapper or a \"duck pastry\" as sold in Chinese supermarkets (10/$1.99); our server called them \"pancakes\".  We ordered 2 legs (1 is $18, 2 are $21, so it's foolish to order just one, especially when sharing).  The duck legs are battered and deep fried.  The batter is nice and crispy, and our server deboned the legs at the table and shredded the duck into bite size pieces suitable for the wrappers.  Whether you order one duck leg or two, the quantity of condiments is the same.  Five of the above-mentioned wrappers were served (this is for 2 people and 2 duck legs, remember), along with four of the tiniest condiment dishes you can imagine, containing small amounts of cucumber, celery, shredded scallion (green onion), and hoisin sauce.  If you have eaten Peking duck in pancakes/wrappers, you know that the usual additions are scallions and hoisin sauce.  We felt the cucumber and celery were superfluous, but ok.  The amount of scallion, however, was utterly laughable, not more than 1/3 of one small scallion (white part only).  Has the scallion market suddenly skyrocketed?   I purchased 3 bunches for $1 the next day at T&T when we went in search of Chinese roast duck and wrappers to satisfy ourselves after the disappointment at Linda.    As you might imagine, we had to request more wrappers and more scallions.  Along came 5 more wrappers, with, again, four tiny dishes containing scallion, celery, cucumber (we had not finished the celery and cucumber from the first round, and wanted only scallions), and hoisin.  For this tiny serving, we discovered when our bill arrived that we were charged $6!  We honestly felt like running up to McEwan, purchasing a bunch of green onions, and bringing them back to donate to Linda, where there is apparently a serious shortage (of both scallions and hospitality).  The total lack of \"generosity\" with the accompaniments for the duck legs pretty much ruined the experience for us, in spite of the fact that we enjoyed the food.  My husband was so put off that at this moment, even three days later, he says he has no interest whatsoever in returning to Linda, and quite honestly, I don't either.  It will be a long time, if ever, that we bother to dine at Linda again.  There is a lesson to be learned here for the restaurant - for the cost of a few wrappers and a couple of scallions, you may have permanently lost a pair of long-time customers.  Hope it was worth it for you."}
{"text":"Linda's Modern Thai Cuisine, why not? So we decided to try out some Thai food at Shoppes on Don mills. I first thought to myself \"This place looks nice!\" So an automatic 5 stars for decor. The atmosphere was a little quiet but nice (it was a weeknight). Our Korean server was nice and a great server who knew the menu pretty well. Overall she was great, even though she did pull the I have a bf line when we tried to set her up with my friend.   Anyways back to the review. The food was delicious. We started with Mieng Kum, Pla Meuk Tod (Fried Calamari), and Tom Yum Goong soup, and our entrees were The Royal Pad Thai, Thai Islamic Noodles, and Seafood Fried Rice. We ended the meal off with Mango Sticky Rice. (To see all the food and descriptions check out my photos). Although it was not what I was expecting because it was more of a modern  taste. I am used to eating authentic Thai cuisine, so that's why I can't give the food a solid 5."}
{"text":"This was an excellent place for dinner when visiting Shops at Don Mills. I'm on a quest to try every restaurant in the area, and Linda Modern Thai did not disappoint. The atmosphere was quaint and cosy and had very nice decor. Not too crowded even for a Saturday night, and opentable points always put a smile on my face. What I will say however is that we were seated awkwardly close to our neighbour table, such that conversations could easily be overheard. I felt quite strange at one point listening about someone's romantic escapades, and did not wish to talk about any of my own for fear of being judged.  The food however was a redeeming point. Deviating from traditional thai dishes, my girlfriend and I opted for the spring lamb and the steak. Both were cooked perfectly and the peanut sauce on top was absolutely delicious. I was very satisfied and wasn't expecting to get such a well cooked steak here of all places. Next time I visit however, I will be trying multiple other dishes more characteristic of Thai cuisine."}
{"text":"Sister restaurant of Salad King. It's quite pricier than Salad King, but I think you're more so paying for the ambiance than for the food. The food is pretty much the same that they have at Salad King. If you go there though, I would suggest the Thai Islamic Noodles. The dessert was good as well (such as the fried mango)."}
{"text":"Long-loved restaurants. Came here for like the 10th time and happened to be Summerlicious. This is my first time trying out their Summerlicious menu and I gotta say - hated it.  We ordered the Red curry duck off of the regular menu and it was delicious as always. The Summerlicious menu item - deep fried chicken - came out with blood in between the wing / chest area. You are not supposed to have Blood in chicken - contains tons of bacteria.  The waitress brought the dish back to kitchen and deep fried again, which came out with no blood but outside was too overcooked to bite into.  Overall I would suggest stay away from the Summerlicious/Winterlicious menu, just go with the regular curry and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.  Nice decor and good service.  We were greeted by Linda.  Started with beef satay.  Meat and sauce were both good.  Green curry with chicken was average. The curry was too watery.  Mango sticky rice was no good.  The rice was hard and the mango wasn't fresh.  I personally like the \"old\" Linda more; the previous Linda was an upstairs restaurant together with Salad King."}
{"text":"Linda's Doughnuts 5/5 with the sangkaya. Order extra. Thank me later. Pad Thai 3/5; Thai Islamic Noodles 3/5; Tom Yum Talay 3/5; In terms of food it wasn't anything special. The ambience at the location at Don Mills is nice; you can go for a nice long walk outside after a big expensive meal."}
{"text":"I come here regularly for food coz it's so good. Love their green and panama curry. Today the Thai taco skin was a bit dry. But flavour is good. The pad Thai is pretty good, has the sweet and sour element pretty balanced, but flavour wasn't as strong as I would've liked. But otherwise it was very good food! I'm giving it 4 star this time coz the two items weren't as good today, but normally you cannot go wrong with the green or panang curry... They are incredible!"}
{"text":"Bad food. Bad service. We were hoping for more from a place on don mills. At first the maitre d shook his head to the person behind the counter to not let us in since we had kids (not in the least badly behaved) and when he noticed  I saw that they let us in. When we ate the food was low on flavor. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place got an average of 3 stars....wheres the love? I on the other hand had a great overall experience. Yes the price is above average, but when the restaurant is so nicely decorated and the waiters pick every last piece of scrap that fell on the table then I can accept the higher prices - not to mention the food was awesome.  Got the following: 1) Lobster bisque $9 2) Chicken satays aka chicken skewers  $7 (3 pieces) 3) Crispy beef panang curry $13 (lunch time only price) 4) Thai style beef wrap with mango salad $13 (lunch special - Jennifer K. loves lunch specials)  The lobster bisque was the real deal. An actual medium size piece of lobster - not the cheap shredded kind. A really strong seafoody taste but not worth $9 (worth a try one time) 5/5 stars.  The chicken skewers with peanut sauce was really good BUT I like the ones at \"One2 Snack\" better 4/5 stars.  The crispy beef and curry was the bomb. The coconut milk curry sauce was literally drinkable its so good. Drizzled it over everything I ate and there wasn't a drop left after everything was said and done. The beef fell apart it was so nice and soft. 5/5  The beef wrap was okay when compared to the curry 3/5 stars BUT it came with a mango salad which was amazing. Fresh crispy mango's + additional vegetation - it was sweet and sour at the same time but not overpowering... really light and fresh tasting 5/5  Overall a great experience and service was great. However, this was on a Monday afternoon lunch and there were only 3 other tables being served. Highly recommended, especially the panang curry.  4.5 stars"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on the weekend and it was OK.  Other trips in the past seemed more thought provoking!    On this evening we started the night with a few Steam whistle pilsner's.  We ordered the Chicken Golden Curry, a Pad Thai Shrimp and a crispy Beef Panang.  Food was okay but my memories was that the place was better!  I believe if you want a better food experience head to the sister restaurant Salad King).  Although Salad King is not for the faint of heart (like eating your meal in a train station) the ambiance at Linda is quite nice!  Price is however double of that of SK.    All in all a decent experience but not earth shattering amazing!"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner with the family. Really liked the service here. It was not rushed but we always could get service when needed. We started with the mango salad and calamari. For mains we had beef short rib with coconut chilli, Islamic noodle, duck in red curry and salmon in Tom yum sauce. All the dishes were delicious. The short rib was perfectly cooked and tender. The duck was crispy on the outside and tender inside. Overall great food and great service. Pistachio ice cream was different from every other place and tasted like actual pistachios and not artificial flavour."}
{"text":"So I came here in early fall and both my mom and I feel that this place has gone downhill so fast.  They have now undergone new management and now it's the son of the owner (Linda) who manages the place.    First of all, they've completely changed the menu.  So these really awesome fish cakes are now gone.  They've shrunken down the amount of satays you get as an appetizer.  And their curry chicken now uses some frozen, tasteless chicken from God knows where.    You know, honestly, if I am choosing to go to Linda, I'm hoping for more upscale Thai food.  If I wanted simple, fast-food style Thai food, I'd be going to the son's more casual restaurant, Salad King.  Why not just re-name the restaurant as Salad King because for all I know, the quality of food is just as sub-par as its downtown counterpart.    This Thai restaurant was once my favourite restaurant.  Sadly, it's standards have dropped exponentially and I won't be going back.  There are tons of other restaurants in Shops of Don Mills that will provide me with a more enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner and was greeted by a very friendly waiter :)  From first glance, the decor had a really traditional Thai feel but still lived up to the modern in its name.  I quite liked the interior of this resto!  Combo of gold and oak made everything very classy :)  This is a mid-scale Thai resto so the pricing is higher than Salad King and is similar to Sukho Thai.  We ordered the Coconut Seafood Curry and Spring Lamb with Peanut Gravy for our mains.  The curry was absolutely delicious!  I always like only a tinge of sweet in my curries - the one I had at Sukho Thai a while back had a bit too much and in combination with the cream became overpowering.  This one was creamy to the right extent and the seafood was to die for.  My favourite was the squid!  This dish also came with jasmine rice.  We also ordered the spring lamb medium rare and it was quite juicy :3 We liked the sauce a lot but I didn't actually taste any peanut... all the better because I don't really like the peanut taste in salty dishes.    Dessert!! 1) Mango Sticky Rice:  Looks very pretty, tastes almost as pretty.  I thought the rice could be a bit sweeter, but it was balanced out by the mango - not bad! 2) Mango Roll with Ice Cream:  DEELISHUS.  I wasn't a huge fan of the fried shell that the mango custard nested in, it's oily if you have too much of it but the mango custard was amazing.  I don't know how they made it but I will now begin looking for these in Asian supermarkets.  The papaya ice cream also tasted amazing with the mango sauce over it  I would definitely go back again to try more dishes on the menu! I'm a fan :)"}
{"text":"I was here with a party of 10 for my first visit. We actually had to push out our reservation twice and they we're nice enough to accommodate.  We came for the Summerlicious menu (which had a lot of options in comparison to other Summerlicious menus).   I started off with the chicken lemongrass siu mai.  I received three pieces which was fairly generous. The chicken was perfectly cooked and juicy. I was happy that the lemongrass DIDN'T take a back seat.  For the entree I ordered the smoked duck breast with quinoa. As soon my order arrived I could smell the smoke and I couldn't wait to dig in. I loved every last bite. The portion was more than generous. My only wish would be to have bigger pieces of duck.  I also didn't feel that this dish had anything Thai in it.   We also ordered two pad Thais and a grilled chicken in Panaang sauce for the table. The pad Thai was actually wrapped in the egg which was cool. But it was a huge let down in terms of flavor. I actually didn't try the chicken so I will not comment on it.   For dessert I had the deep fried milk pudding. Some people at the table felt like it was visually unappealing. I didn't have a problem with it. I actually liked it. It wasn't too sweet and that's what I liked about it.   Overall, very few complaints about the food. Based on my experience I wouldn't call this a great Thai restaurant. Because the pad Thai wasn't up to par, the sui mai is more of a Chinese dish (with a Thai influence via the lemongrass), and the smoked duck with quinoa really didn't scream Thai either. But one thing it's for sure,  I'm not complaining at all about the taste and quality of the food. I also was fortunate to try the crispy brisket in panaang sauce and it was incredible!   Or server was AWESOME!!! she did a great job with such a large group. Our water would get filled as soon as it was low. We actually stayed way past closing and we didn't feel as though we were rushed. Truly exceptional service."}
{"text":"The food here left me so disappointed!  I came here with my parents, since they had been here before and enjoyed it. Too bad there was no encore of the good experience.  I had the pomelo salad (September special), which had the oddest mix of flavours I have ever tasted. I was expecting a very light, crispy salad (I imagine baby lettuce and spinach and tomatoes and other crunchy watery things would complement the pomelo well...) but what I got was lettuce with pomelo and SHRIMP (!!) with some sort of peanut-cinnamon sauce, and hot peppers. The tastes clashed in a way that caught me totally off-guard, and not pleasantly. Hey guys, here's a tip...if you were trying to cover all of the food groups, you missed dairy!  *CUE THE LONGEST WAIT EVER FOR OUR MAIN COURSES*  I got the green curry chicken, which was cold by the time it got to my table. The crispy duck pancakes and the fish that my parents ordered were also cold too! Why did we wait so long, and why were they so cold?! Maybe you can answer that yourselves.   I'm going to give them two stars instead of one because the service was decent. Seated quickly; the waitress was attentive and easily flagged (isn't it the most frustrating thing when it seems like all the waiters in a restaurant are giving you the silent treatment?), and the waitress also \"forks\" the duck off the bone for the crispy duck pancakes entree, which was incredible to watch. I couldn't think of another verb...she literally just took two forks and (WITH BLACK MAGIC) got all the duck off the bone. Cool.  Still doesn't make up for the fact that I go to a restaurant to eat good food, not to see a good show."}
{"text":"* this review is a bit dated* I came here for Summerlicious 2013. This place is pretty chic and nicely decorated. For some reason, it reminded me of several fancy posh restaurants in Las Vegas - needless to say, the environment is very appealing to the eyes. My Jamaican friend was really digging the décor as well. I guess it comes with the territory that this is an expensive location, Linda Modern's price tag is generally $1-5 above market rate for similar dish offered at other Asian restaurants.  Foodwise, my friend was not impressed at all and didn't finished her main course. Since I generally enjoy salty food, I had no problem finishing everything in my plate. However, even I found their food a bit too salty and had to wash it down with 3 cups of water.  Although we were there for lunch, we ordered their Asianized cocktails to go with our food. It's definitely a good decision. We loved the presentation - very cute and tropical. Perhaps you should give it a try too - even if you are only there for their drinks =) No one will judge"}
{"text":"Personally, I feel that Linda's is overrated.  The venue is nice and the restaurant looks really upscale, but the quality in the food was poor.  I went here with my girlfriends and we all ordered from the fixed price menu.  Our starters and meals all came out at different times.  The thai pumpkin soup that I got was too salty and the remainder of the meal was too bland.  I can tell that there was some thought put into the presentation of the dishes but the execution was not impressive.  For example, the seafood egg custard dish came in a steamer, and the vegetarian main that my friend had came atop a burner.  It looked cool, but really did not serve any additional function.  I do like the venue because it was quiet and we had a secluded area, which allowed us some privacy.  Our server was nice too, and helped us take some photos as well as gave us some free hot sauce jars to take home."}
{"text":"Been going out for Thai a lot lately.  Just went to Restoran Malaysia (Review for that coming soon) and was very satisfied there.  Leaving Linda's last night, I felt it could of been better.    Pros:   Very nice decor Good Service  Cons: Not much variety on the menu Portions could of been better Hidden automatic gratuity?  I've been told that this is the more upper class sister to Salad King.  Located in the new upscale plaza at Don Mills and Lawrence, it certainly tried to match the ambience of it's location.  Coming in you notice the beautiful decor that have going.  They really did a good job in that regard.  As we sat down, we were greeted by a lady who not only introduced us to the place, menu, and specials, but made some small talk with us as well.  She was pretty funny and made us feel very relaxed before we got started.  I really should of have gotten her name now that I think about it.  Opening the menu, the first thing you notice is there's only a couple of items to choose from.  I would say, a total of 20-25 items on the menu.  I was expecting to see some of my favs from Salad King but that was not to be.  I love the Siam noodles and was really looking forward to that.  We ended up ordering the following:  Beef Panang Half Rack of Ribs with Peanut Sauce (Special for December) Baked Cocunut Fried Rice King Oyster Mushrooms with Soft Tofu Phud Thai  The beef panang was easily my favourite.  The curry was excellent and not to overpowering.  The ribs were ok, a little dry at certain parts but the peanut sauce was great and more than made up for the dryness.  The oyster mushroom dish was decent, not too bad, nothing special either.   The phud thai and coconut baked rice were very disappointing in my opinion.  This was shared by the 4 other people at my table.  The phud thai was a little on the sour side for me.  It came wrapped in an egg omolet.  This was a good and bad thing.   For presentation, it was good, for portion size, bad.  The omolet was about half the size of the plate it was served on.  There really wasn't a lot of food to be honest.  The rice was even worse.  Again, presentation was nice and fun being in a coconut, portion size, horribad..  Some of the dishes we ordered came with a bowl of rice.  There had to be half that amount of rice in that coconut.  To get half a bowl of rice, 3 shrimps, and 2 scallops for $19, Fail.  Honestly, I liked the plain rice they gave me better than the fried rice in the coconut.  One of the reasons I like Salad King is because their portions were very good for their price.  This was not the case here.  At the end of the meal, we were surprised to see that we were dinged with an automatic 15% gratutity.  We were only 5 people so it was a little shocking.  A check back at the menu didn't reveal anything stating such a practice as well.  I wasn't really happy about this one.  I don't mind automatically gratutity as long as I know ahead of time its coming.  In hindsight, we should of asked them about this but we were in a rush.  If this was just a mistake on their part and not everyday practice, I will update this review as such.  So yeah, a little more on the disappointing side for me to say the least.  It's still a good place to eat, but I will take Salad King (for a quick fix) and Restoran Malaysia (For a sit down) any day over them."}
{"text":"Probably my most favorite Thai restaurant. Almost everything I have tried here is great. Tried pineapple fried rice, fish hot pot, and some penang chicken curry. Dessert options a little bit uninspired though. The usual fried banana and mango ice creams."}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed by the food here, especially the crusted beef panang curry.  The beef is super tender and the curry is absolutely amazing!  I've also tried the Thai Islamic noodle, poached Chilean sea bass and golden beef curry.  My taste buds were very pleased.  The service can go either way - we went here for my birthday and my brother double checked with the waiter that the spring rolls didn't contain any peanuts.  I guess it contained some kind of peanut ingredient so my brother decided not to take it.  Nevertheless, the guy brought it out and was so annoyed when my brother said he didn't want it because it had peanuts.  Don't be such a jerk - people's food allergies are very serious.  Other than that, it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Really shocked that this place only has 3 stars. I wouldn't let that detour you because I had a very nice meal there during Summerlicious. I was there for the 25 dollar dinner, which provided a choice of appertizer, soup or salad, an entree, and a dessert.   For my app, I selected the Satay Shrimp Skewer, which was presented well and was pretty much how you would expect a shrimp skewer to be. It was a nice way to start things off. My girlfriend had the cold rolls, which were nice and fresh, but I think had a little too much carrot in it. I think it would have been better with 50% less carrot and would be better served if they replaced that carrot with cucumber.  For the salad/soup course I had the Mango Salad, which was a good size and was quite pretty. I would definitely say it was big enough to share. My girlfriend had the Chicken Coconut Milk Soup, and I felt this was the only large miss of the meal. The coconut milk was pretty much untraceable in appearance and flavour. The soup also contained chunks on inedible lemongrass. Instead of tasting like coconut, it tasted more of the seafood stock it was based on and was kind of off putting when you were  expecting coconut milk because it was in the title of the dish. I wouldn't recommend it.  For our entree we both got the Crispy Beef Panang Curry and honestly this was the star of the show. My girlfriend had this previously on her first trip to Linda's, and she raved about it. Well, it was still very delicious and I would order a panang curry there if I went again. The beef was cooked well and could have fall apart with a fork if you really wanted it too.  It was also of high quality, and didn't contain any obtrusive fatty bits that got in the way. The crispy batter on the beef maybe could have been thinner, but I didn't mind that too much. The curry sauce was great. Who doesn't love flavours of curry, and coconut, and peanut... mmm yum. I would highly recommend this dish.  For dessert I had papaya ice cream because I was so full, and my girlfriend had the sweet mango sticky rice which was actually two small bits and not heavy looking at all. We both enjoyed our desserts. In the end I'd go back for the crispy beef panang curry, or one of the other curries."}
{"text":"As Canada's first select Thai premium restaurant and is owned by the same people as Salad King, I had very high expectations for Linda Modern Thai. The restaurant is conveniently located in Shops at Don Mills, and the decor is absolutely beautiful. It has a high ceiling and some pillars that provide a very classy, but modern atmosphere.  I visited the restaurant along with three coworkers for lunch on a Friday. My coworker told me that the restaurant is not usually busy, but maybe because it was a Friday, we were not seated immediately (the wait was only about five minutes). Unfortunately, we were unaware that there was a closet for our coats until we saw a server open it and hang a customer's coat after we were already seated for some time. We would have liked it if the server told us about the closet instead of having us find out ourselves.  Overall, the service was great, but the food took a while to arrive. We waited for about 30 minutes for our food. We only had an hour for lunch, so we were pretty tight on time. Make sure that you have plenty of time to sit at the restaurant during a busy Friday period and even reserve a table if possible.  My coworker and I got the Royal Pad Thai. I really liked the presentation of the dish because the pad thai itself is inside an egg wrap. The sweet and sour elements were delicious, but I have had better pad thai at other restaurants before. Linda Modern Thai prides itself of its \"award-winning\" pad thai, but I just didn't think that the flavour justified a high price of $18. Regardless, the noodles tasted great, but I found the chicken a bit dry and hard to chew.  My other coworker got the Tom Yum Goong (hot and sour soup), and she was slightly unimpressed because she was expecting it to be more creamy. Linda serves it with a clear broth, which is a different version of Tom Yum Goong that other restaurants may serve. She also felt that the soup smelled like cleaning supplies, which was not very appetizing. She also got the entree size mango salad, but she wasn't full after eating it.  My fourth coworker got the golden curry with crispy beef. He didn't have any complaints for his curry. In fact, he really enjoyed it. However, he noted that even though he asked for the spiciness level to be the highest, he felt that it was definitely less spicy than Srirarcha sauce.  I would certainly visit Linda Modern Thai again because the food has great flavours, but I would like to try the curry instead. In addition, I would only visit the restaurant if I had time to spare."}
{"text":"Went to Linda's for the first time this afternoon and had a great experience.  The decor is sheek and trendy, and looks like what one would imagine a restuarant in Thailand might actually look like - the upscale, trying-to-be -trendy version, of course. My group was seated in a semi-enclosed private table near the back, which was a bonus as we were away from the busy weekday lunch crowd.  Might be a cool spot for someone going on a first date.  I was a little disappointed at first by the size of the menu. There are about 5 dishes under each of the main umbrellas - curry, noodles and satay. I opted for the golden chicken curry, and was asked \"what level of spice would you like, on a scale from 1 to 10, 3 being a medium\". Well, I likes me some spice, so I chose 6, while my Indian friend chose 8.  We got the calamari appetizer while we waited, and I can honestly say it was the best calamari I've had to date. I loved how the cooks cut the rings into sections to make the pieces more manageable, and the batter was light enough that you could still see the white flesh of the meat, but was extremely flavourful and crispy. It was served with what tasted like a teriyaki-based soy sauce that was sweet and spicy, which was so good I scooped the leftovers from my plate when no one was looking :P  The golden curry at a 6 spice was boarderline too spicy for me (and I'm a hot sauce on anything you can imagine kind of girl), but was complimented well by the cooling coconut milk that comes as an aftertaste to the initial chili and spice taste. My Indian friend said the 8 was almost not spicy enough (I could smell the spice coming off of her plate), so take that for what you will.   I believe this place is owned by the same owners as salad king (?) and I would say this definitely fit the bill as comparable to the curry a-la pre-burnt down Salad King on Gould. Be forewarned - same quality food, but pretentious Shops on Don Mills prices ($7 vs. $12). But even then, highly recommended if you've got the cashola. Like the Terminator, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Really bad experience! 50min to wait for the seafood fried rice and green curry to come. The staff did not notify about Any delays and we had to ask the manager to check on the kitchen 3 times. Definitely won't recommend this place to anyone! And the foods were just ok, even Thai express had more taste and flavors than this place!"}
{"text":"Came here recently for dinner.   The staff seemed nice. My party wanted to switch tables to a more private area & they were very patient with us. However, I felt the entrees took forever to come out. We were there at 8pm and did not get our mains until 9pm. Appetizers took about 15 mins after ordering. It was not a particularly busy night. There was only one larger group of 8? and some tables of 2-4.  We ordered & shared the..  Calamari - overpriced (as w/ the rest of the menu) but good. definitely better with the chilli sauce.  Sausage - wow skip this. it reminded me of dishwasher detergent.  Grilled fish (sea bass?)- I did not taste this so can't comment. but those who ate it were not too particularly happy w/ how it was grilled w/ the tin foil covering it.  Pad Thai - it was interesting as it was covered with a thin egg omlette all around w/ the islamic noodles inside. quite nice. Pannang Curry - I liked this dish best. very tasty! the beef was cooked well and very very tender.  Green Curry - nice dish but not that particularly tasty. i had asked the waitress for hot sauce but never got it.   I felt the portions could be slightly bigger for the curry dishes. It's a wonderful restaurant but service was slow."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious. Decor and establishment seemed fancy and nice, wish I could say the same for the food.  I got the Tom yum soup to start and my friend got the chicken larb. Both were subpar and small portions. I liked the tom yum soup cuz it had seafood and the soup it self was 3/5 good but small portion.  I got the Bangkok fried chicken 3/5 flavour, small portion. Honestly nothing special, my mom makes food like this.  My friend got the pineapple duck curry. It was gross, the duck melts in an uncomfortable way in your mouth. Didn't taste like real duck, curry was super small portion.  The dessert was small portion and mediocre flavor. Got the mixed berry rice, really small portion, 3/5 flavor. The banana leaf one was better, but not by much.  For $28 summerlicious dinner this place sucked. Wouldn't come here to pay full price for dishes, as I felt ripped off even paying summerlicious price. I would suggest to avoid this place."}
{"text":"I attended a private invitation only dinner.  But wow, is this great.  We had lobster bisque, papaya salad, giant shrimp, beef brisket in curry, soft shell crab, plus several more dishes.   I don't have words to describe all the dishes, only to say they are all incredible."}
{"text":"ENVIRONMENT - cute date place! Good location as well as it's in the Shops at Don Mills. Decor is quite nice and asian themed of course.  SERVICE - attentive servers, and Linda came by twice to check up on us and chat you up, which I thought was great! She would try to chat you up as well and even helped me scrape the coconut pieces in the my coconut curry.  FOOD - Mmm love the Seafood Coconut Curry here! Definitely recommend this.the seafood curry comes in an actual coconut, and not just an emptied out coconut shell. I originally thought it was so I was pleasantly surprised when Linda came by and told me there were still lots of coconut meat in it. She even helped me scrape a generous chunk of the coconut! There was a good amount of seafood in it as well.   My bf got the crispy duck pancake. It's kinda similar to Peking duck, but the duck is actually deep fried. The dish comes presented so that you can see the duck portion you ordered.. And then the waiter would shred the duck for you so you can put the shredded pieces in a steamed rice wrapper (like peking duck). This was an okay dish.. Kinda different, but I'd much prefer the original peking duck style.  Prices were reasonable. Dishes ranged from $15-$30. I'd come again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant.  I've been here for lunch, for dinner, with small parties and with large groups - the food and the service is very consistent.  Although they have a different and pricier menu than their first location Salad King (Yonge/Dundas), the selection is wonderful - and they will happily make you something off of Salad King's menu if you ask for it.  Best dish is the panang curry - Beef panang (lunch and dinner portions are prepared differently - dinner is crispy), or my favourite, the Thai Islamic Noodles with shrimp and chicken.  If you ever experience a problem, the manager (and often the owner Linda herself) is right there, and they will go out of their way to correct it for you with a smile.  Their portions are also extremely generous.  Noodles, rice dishes, satays, and desserts are all equally wonderful.  I have never had a bad meal here since the day it opened."}
{"text":"I went out for my birthday dinner. We ordered: -APPETIZER  -Chicken & Beef Satay's (OKAY)  -MAIN  -Chicken And Duck Larb / Lettuce Wraps (OKAY) -Smoked Duck / Golden Curry (AMAZING)  -DESSERT  -Sweet Fried Banana (Yummy) -Mango Stick Rice (Too Sour, better at Salad King!)  Overall I enjoyed my meal, the atmosphere, the staff and walking around the outdoor mall before."}
{"text":"The place has really nice ambiance and service but I find the food over priced for the quality. The Pad Thai tasted really nice, but both my mother and I felt really thirsty after the meal, like the way I feel after eating dim sum that has MSG.  The chicken satay was good, nothing was out of the extraordinary and the portions quite small. I usually love Tom Kha soup at Thai restaurants but I wouldn't recommend it here. They give you just a tiny shot of coconut milk and its deconstructed which I was not a fan of, not to mention it was $13 for a small portion.  This is definitely more of an upscale Thai restaurant, but I personally prefer the hearty family run joints."}
{"text":"First time at Linda's and it won't be the last. I was a bit hesitant to come here based on some of the bad reviews on Yelp but I'm so glad that I did.   Yes, it is a bit pricier than your average Thai food but the food is tasty and the ambience is on point.  It is clean, spacious, decorated with both modern and traditional furnishing. Between the four of us, we ordered the fried calamari, royal pad Thai, crispy beef red curry and the crispy duck wrap. My favourite was the crispy beef curry and duck wrap and I don't even like duck!  The curry was soooo rich in flavour that we wiped the bowl clean with our side order of Naan. As for the duck wrap, it's almost like Peking duck except it was deep fried to give it that extra crunch and it was served with lettuce for you to wrap it in.  The portions are pretty good, we finished everything and were all stuffed.   Our server was friendly and quite informative. We asked for more lettuce wrap for our duck which she happily provided us with. We will definitely  come back next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Lovely place for dinner. Décor is beautiful; although a bit too much gold for my liking. Friendly staff and welcoming atmosphere.  Tom yum soup was 'yum'. Spiciness and sourness was well balanced; shrimps were also big and fresh, soup came nice and hot. Calamari was served fresh, hot and crispy, while inside was fresh and chewy. Satays were also pretty nice; a lot of places fail at the sauce but this place was pretty authentic. The meat was also not dry or chewy. The curries in my opinion could be spicier, that dish wasn't too satisfying. Could have gone without that one. When you're trying out a new Thai place, you have to try their pad thai to determine whether or not it's worth your next visit. While a lot of places use ketchup to compensate for the flavours and colours, this place did not. So go ahead and give it a try if you're a pad thai fan.  Traditional Thai dessert sticky rice with mango and coconut milk was delish, nice ending to a satisfying meal. Rice was soft and chewy with their coconut milk being very fragrant. You might want to share this one as it can be a bit heavy.  This restaurant's standards were good at the time I went, which was maybe a year ago. Considering where they are located, their quality shouldn't go down. Note: if you're looking for a 'good deal meal', try Kinnaree Thai Restaurant, my personal second fave next to this one."}
{"text":"Pretty pricey but I guess that is the norm of the shops at don mills. The food quality was 'ok'  but I would never crave for this place. Service was great though. I would definitely rather drive downtown to get some Khao San road or pai.   Had the crispy duck ( as recommended get the two legs for 3 bucks more, as suggested by the server. Worth the 3 bucks).  The thai ice tea tasted diluted comparing to Khao s road and sipz from San deigo. The curry was alright. Nothing special.   Shrugs. Nothing special here I would say but the area is nice. So if you are in the shops and don mills area you may consider trying this."}
{"text":"Love the decor. Food isn't that great. Service is good though  I feel like after visiting Thailand with my boyfriend and being able to taste delicious authentic thai food nothing compares. It's just not the same. Or maybe Linda Modern Thai just isn't that great in general. There really is nothing special here. i've dined at Linda about two times so far and nothing has wow'd me. Once about almost two years ago, and the second time just recently.   It is expensive.. Try it if you want. everyone has their own taste buds. so maybe you'll like it"}
{"text":"Ever since the renovations at Shops at Don Mills this place became sorta pretentious for most folks.  New restaurants like Linda's Modern Thai would come into the picture where one would expect a \"Thai Express\" but with a more higher price tag. But boy, was I wrong. Pricey? Yes. Atmosphere? beautiful. Love the decor. Btw, it's an older crowd, on a Friday night, you might just bump into your grannies. Service? Meh. Average + 1. Oh wait, they did made us wait for 10 mins. You know, like a random club/bar where they make you stand inline, but when you get inside its not full at all. Yup, I've counted at least 5 empty party for 2 tables. Ok, maybe their customers finished and secretly left from the tiny windows in the bathroom (note: there were no windows in the bathroom) Food? Well ... not like \"Thai Express\" !! We ordered two noodle dishes. A regular chicken pad thai and a thin clear seafood noodle dish. It took around 15-20 mins, adding to not like \"Thai EXPRESS\" column.  It's okay, they have a nice bar for you to get your cocktails whole you wait.  When the food finally arrived, they both came in a very thin omelette.  Wrapped, actually. And you gently slices it open, the noodle dishes are inside. Its brilliant! The aroma of the dishes immediately fills the air. Not only this kept the noodles warm, it was very tasty too.  The noodles were neither over cooked, nor it was soggy. It was perfectly balanced with the veggies and meat/shrimps.  I'd definitely recommend to all my friends.  I'd say this is one of the finest Pad Thai in Toronto.  Well done, Linda! It worth the wait."}
{"text":"Went for summerlious two weeks ago. Food are sucks. And being charge 3 dollars per person for water??????"}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting Linda's, and will be my last. I arrived on time, however my friend ran late. I went in to be seated, but did not see anyone at the from maitre d' desk, so i walked into the restaurant. A man, whom I'm guessing was the manager quickly walked me back to the front desk and asked if I had a reservation. I did, but i found this rude since the restaurant was not busy at all. Once he confirmed that I had a reservation he proceeded to show me to my seat; i commented that my friend was running late, but then he asked if my friend was female- I found this to be a very weird question! As soon as she arrived, the waitress tried to take our order, which my friend did not even have a chance to look at the menu yet.  While dining, the waitress would converse with other diners, however she never checked in on our table once, other than to whisk away plates the moment our food was done- we felt rushed the whole time and the place wasn't even busy! The waitress took away our dessert plates and promptly brought our bill, which we found rude since we wanted to talk for a few minutes. We did not leave the typical  15% tip since it wasn't earned- we found that we felt rushed, the server was not attentive,and the deep fried banana batter was undercooked. The waitress had the nerve to come back to the table and point out that it was low tip and wasn't the right percentage. We commented that we knew, but she stood there with a confused look on her face and her hand out with the change. I was going to give her the extra money since it was very awkward and uncomfortable situation, however my friend was quite upset that this server was asking for more money when she did not deserve a tip- she was lucky to get anything at this point. The server stood there clueless and kept pointing out that it wasn't a typical tip, to the point where my friend became upset, left the money on the table and stormed out- i couldn't help but laugh at this point... i feel awful now. But the server grabbed the money from the table and took off to her manager!! The manager did not make an effort what-so-ever to try to mitigate the issue or try to find out what was wrong with the service.  The next crappy part was that my coat was in coat check, so I had to approach another server to retrieve it. The server that retrieved my coat was fantastic! She was kind and probably the best part to this experience! The original server looked confused and was still  talking to the manager, she didn't seem to care that she left me with no coat to begin with.   The winterlicious portions were tiny, like the appetizer said chicken skewers but 1 chicken skewer was on the plate... The food is mediocre and there are better options in the area. If you're willing to trek downtown, by all means try Khao San Road, some of the best thai food in Toronto. I work in the area and have many friends that know their way around a plate or two, we will not be returning here."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior decor!  Came here for dinner on a week night and it moderately busy. Reservations were made the day before to ensure we had a table for 4 set aside. However it didn't seem necessary.  We shared a mango salad and it was delicious. Mangos were ripe and not bitter but sweet. I ordered the curry sampler as I couldn't make up my mind with the crispy beef and a side of veggies for an extra $5. The crispy beef was awful, I don't think I've ever had beef that tasted so dry and the seasoning was off. My favourite curry of the 3 was the red curry. There were definitely slight differences to the 3 curries and the red was the sweetest. Don't think it would have been enough to eat as just an entrée if I only ordered that without the veggies or salad. My friends enjoyed their meals which kept the rating at a 3 instead of a 2."}
{"text":"* UPDATE This is an Update to my previous review, I just came To this restaurant for lunch, I stood by the host stand, there was no one else. Then two separate groups of three people each walked in. The host came in and totally ignored me like you did not even see me I start talking to the first group, he went and got their table ready and set them down. Then he came back and I was thinking that it is my turn although I was first to start with, he doesn't even acknowledge me standing there and he starts talking to the second group, he goes a set of their table and come and get them seated. Both tables did not have reservations they said that.  Then this same host come back after about five minutes of me standing there, as I really wanted to know what was his reason, he comes back and he says are you OK? I was like what do you think? Just give me one reason that she did not acknowledge me standing here and you said two separate groups before me while I was here first, and his answer was I don't really have an answer if you would like to stay sure if you do not want understand and I'm OK with that!!! This host is an older gentleman, not sure if he is the owner or a manager or just an employee, but he's the worst customer service i have ever encountered, whatever his reasons are!  I will never step a foot in this place! What a shame!! so I just walkedout!  !!!!!!"}
{"text":"My friend who lives at a condo near by goes there all the time! He took me there for lunch so I just went whatever he was heading to.  As soon as we walked in the ppl greeted him n I, and I could tell they obviously know him. They were little TOO NICE though. Don't get me wrong, I like good service, but some times u get the feeling that they are \"pulling your leg n kissing ass\". Its bit too much for me. But yeah still they were nice.   The server asked us if we were going to order lunch potion or meal potion because the meal potion are bigger. We ordered meal potions, we had yellow curry shrimp and green curry chicken. They both came pretty SMALL for meal size lol. I loved the green curry chicken but its not best I have had. Their curry seem to be little watery. I like thicker coconut milk curries. The yellow curry had different kick to it. I liked it as well.  Just the down side was I had stomach burn for the whole afternoon. I was quite sure was from the curry dishes we had at d place. I rarely get burning sensation from spicy food, it has to be suicide level, but we ordered level 2 n 3 out of 20 levels we could pick. I am sure was something to do with the cury.   I dont mind going there if someone eles is paying hah. =) (**shhhhhh* dont say anything). I can easily find tons nice Thai food places downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try Linda's today.  We were disappointed with the level of service and the food.  We ordered the spring rolls as an appetizer.  The server forgot that we ordered the spring roll appetizer and after 15 minutes asked us if we still wanted it because she forgot to put in the order.  20 minutes after we ordered the server brought out two spring rolls cut in half that looked like they were just brought out of the deepfryer and previously frozen.  Definitely not worth it to order again.  I ordered the special soup (forgot what it was called) and a few of the shrimps weren't de-veined.  The server never came back to ask us how our food was, never once.  The only time she came back was to clear our dishes and ask us if we wanted to order any dessert.  We won't come back here again. I think i'll just stick with Salad King downtown."}
{"text":"This review is based on my lunch experience at  Summerlicious 2014.  I was not expected much for $15 but I am happy to report that Linda Modern Thai did not cheap out on food quality or portion even during Summerlicious!  Chicken Lemongrass Pork Siu Mai Crispy Beef Panang (Gaeng Panang) Deep Fried Milk Pudding  All was really solid and especially the main was just the same size as regular $13 lunch and here they charging $15 for a 3 course.  I ate the level 15 spiciness and I survived. Maybe I should go for the ultimate next time?  Service was spotty though as the place was packed and I sat at the corner of the patio.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I went with a group, we were given a reservation for 8:30p.  After being seated and chatting a bit the waitress came over and told us the kitchen was closing in 20 minutes. So rushed to order. I'm not a curry fan, so in my rush to order I didn't realize my dish included curry. My fault completely. When my dish arrived I asked what do you have w/meat and no curry. To my surprise not much!  We figured it out amongst ourselves at the table and I had the Duck, which was so delicious.  I tasted a small peice of the beef brisket (that was slathered in curry) and it was sooooooooo incredibly dry.  I lived in Texas for a few years and that brisket would make a Texan cry! The service was very slow, they were down servers. The menu was sooooooooo limited. The coconut ice cream was not very good.  And we knew it was time to retire for the night when the manager shut off all of the lights in the restaurant.   I didn't get all the hoopla about this place."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere  Overpriced food ! Not worth it I had better. They tasted better as a fast food restaurant. Disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located in the Floridianesce outdoor Shops at Don Mills, Linda is a hip, trendy, upscale restaurant featuring homemade Thai cuisine. Usually I'm not one that goes to upscale ethnic restaurants but we had a gift certificate and went with the gf's family.   For 5 people we ordered:  2 Mango salads 2 Traditional platters (6 satays, 2 spring rolls each) Spring rolls Pad Thai Bangkok stir fry Chicken with thai basil Fried banana with honey Fried banana with ice cream    Appetizers weren't anything spectacular, but enjoyable. Mango salad was a light refreshing start to the meal. The pad thai was interestingly served as what appeared as some square-shaped pastry. After tearing into the dish, we realized this was pad thai wrapped in a giant sheet of egg. The bangkok stir fry was served in a similar fashion.   Favorites were the bangkok stir fry and the pad thai. After seeing many reviews, I wish we tried the crispy beef. The fried bananas with ice cream was served with tropical ice cream flavors - I recommend the coconut! The service could be improved.   Overall, it was a good meal but I don't think I'd go back as I usually stick to the smaller type thai restaurants."}
{"text":"Linda is the more upscale sister restaurant to everyone's favourite thai cheap eat spot downtown. Located at Shops at Don Mills (my new favourite mall for dining, love Joey Don Mills and Fabbrica!), it's really quite a lovely place to enjoy a nice dinner, but the prices are considerably higher. The decor is very elegant, featuring a large classic Thai temple centerpiece. The restaurant itself isn't that big, but the high ceilings give a sense of spaciousness and adds to the grandeur of the place.   Now onto the food:  Pad thai: rice noodles, carrots, peanuts, tofu, green onions, bean sprouts, coriander, egg, fish, and tamarind sauce with chicken. I'm not a fan of the chicken, but loved every other component in it. This is a refined version of my favourite Thai dish, and the flavours are spot on- perfectly sweet and sour. I found it extremely hard to stop myself from having more.  Beef Panang: Tender beef with crispy coating served in Panang Curry with peanut and coconut milk. I couldn't get enough of the scrumptious curry sauce in this dish. It's hard for curry to stand out for me because I've tried so many variations of it in my life, but this one certainly did. The crusted beef was just so perfect with the incredible sauce. I loved the contrast between the crispy exterior and the tender meat. The curry is moderately spicy, but I wouldn't mind if it had even more heat.  It was a very enjoyable meal and despite the steeper prices, I would definitely come back to eat the curry beef again."}
{"text":"Best mango salad I had in the city! (I got a lunch special today: mango salad plus satay) good portion, not too full! Great service too!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  I have been to this restaurant twice within the past year and each time has been unimpressive.  Nice wait staff but, both times I went they were understaffed and as a result the service was slow.  The first time I had the staple pad Thai  which had an unappealing sauce blend.  The second time I went recently and had the green curry with chicken.  The curry had very weak flavour and the chicken was low quality, something I'd expect from a fast food restaurant.  The white rice was the best portion of the meal, honestly.  The food is well overpriced for the quality.   Overall the decor was nice if not a bit superfluous, and the waitress was pleasant, but the food was very underwhelming and not worth it."}
{"text":"I like this place. I always forget how much until I go and then end up wondering why I don't come more.  Outside- the restaurant is located at shops of don mills. It has a cool facade that makes me feel kinda cool walking into. There's outside seating. Its still cold out so its closed but I feel it must give a great view of the comings and goings of the plaza ( cool ).  Decor - its kinda weird. You walk in and it feels like its going to be a super fancy restaurant. Its not BTW, which is AWESOME.  There are lots of dark pillars which is nice, it gives you some semblance of privacy. The restaurant is smaller than it looks on the outside.  The best part of the restaurant is a giant sequin, shiny  Buddha statue in the middle.  If you get to sit by it, you have something special to look at!  Wait staff - this is hit or miss. Don't get me wrong. Everyone is proficient. I'm not sure if they are told to be  not so smiley and friendly, its not that they are mean and rude, its just they never smile. Ever. Well at least no one I've ever had  Food -  ok this is what really counts!  The food is really good. I've never had anything I didn't like. Ok I just lied. The desserts level a lot to be desired but there lots of places to go for dessert in the plaza.  Their vegetarian entrees are worth coming g here for. Yum. Also, the beef panang. I want to eat this every Saturday!! Every Saturday!!   Price- right, so when I get the bill I remember why I don't come here more. I hate paying that much for Thai. But it is really good, so my every once and a while visits are fine!!  Go, its good!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and sympathetic service can't make up for the small portions and poor quality of Linda. The only positive was that the restaurant was empty and sat our party on a Friday night, but that should have been a sign...  Golden curry with crispy beef was one of the better dishes though still a very small portion for $19. The pad thai was very underwhelming and tiny for $18. Four mini chicken satays for $10 was robbery. We ordered a few other dishes (jungle sauce chicken, pad pac ruammtir, had cha tallay) that were completely forgetful.   Our waitress was very kind and pleasant though got a few of the orders incorrect. As others have mentioned the interior is fancy with a nice Asian-flair and accommodates large groups. However, on the food side Linda was a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Three of us reserved at Linda Modern Thai for my sister's birthday. Service was friendly and efficient, food was really tasty. Pad Wun Sen was a great alternative to pad thai, with clear vermicelli noodles. The mango in the mango salad was just the right level of ripeness. \"Curry Tasting\" was great with three different curries in gravy boats, what a great way to enjoy three lovely curries. We all enjoyed our meal and the cool Back lit tea box and tea infusers were a nice treat. I highly recommend Linda Modern Thai."}
