{"text":"Went for a drink last Friday. Huge cockroach crawling up the wall.. called over a waitress to point it out.. and another huge cockroach appeared.. (i'm talking  an inch body length). She offered to move tables for us, and talked to a manager.. who didn't do anything.. could still see the roach on the wall.. left.. would never go back."}
{"text":"Went there to watch a sporting event. Service was spotty as they were pretty busy. Apps were good for bar food but nothing to go back for. Wings are huge but overcooked."}
{"text":"Ok service The crab bites were way over cooked Prime rib burger dry with no flavor"}
{"text":"Just finished a meal here and it was the worst meal I've ever had. We picked this restaurant because it was in our hotel binder as a suggested place in the area. Horrible service. Steak tasted like it was boiled. My husband and I have had stomach cramps since we left there."}
{"text":"Usually find Arizonas as a safe option. Has always had decent food and good service so yesterdays visit may have been an anomaly.  For the first time food choice was a big miss. Thai chicken had a number of unidentifiable ingredients and was tasteless. Companions burrito was also uninspiring.   Server seemed like she'd rather be anywhere else but on the job.  Overall experience was pretty disappointing but since its been very good in the past will likely   Give it another chance in the future."}
{"text":"If you want drunk guys, semi decent looking waitress,  plain food for more than average price and no refills, this is the place to go. Was disappointing overall and will definitely not come back, my guess is that this is a tourist trap for those staying in the hotels around the airport."}
{"text":"Food okay, decent beers...perfect for guys that like half naked female bartenders"}
{"text":"Came here on a UFC night and left before I was even seated. Doorman was a total ass and tried to get me to buy a beer before he would tell me if there was seating available. Looked like a very low end strip club."}
{"text":"Nothing special, but not a total waste of money either. Wait staff is definitely attractive but certainly has some attitude. The outdoor area is cool - fun watching planes land and a great place to drink beer. Stay away from the Chicken Curry (yuck) but other menu items looked okay. Good place to watch the Jays, though."}
{"text":"Awful service have to go to the bar get a drink still did not my change nor did I get a menu...eventhough there seemed to be four hostesses..lives up to the reputation, bigger chest..worse service..actually I have had better service at a hooters"}
{"text":"Trashiest place I have been to around the area. First the service is terrible I sat at my and waited for someone to come over for 15 min before goin back to the front and asking to get reset somewhere else. Both times getting sat I was sat at a dirty table and told to wait for someone to come over and clean it, which never happened. The staff was running around screaming f*ck you f*ck this in the middle of the restaurant like they were drunk. Throughout the whole experience I only saw who I thought was my server 2 times to take my order and to drop off the bill.  The food was alright not great but, pretty good for the price. Will never be going back here again."}
{"text":"Very good fajitas and good srvice so like it in general to many experiences in Fajitas could confimed it is good one"}
{"text":"Airport bars! Hey I didn't expect much. But I was pleasantly surprised. While the Yelp elite were having their party down on Queen East I was hosting 120 of Toronto's top contractors at this place. I hadn't visited the place before I made the reso, but a few people had heard about it, and it had some of the things that fit the requirements. It was close to a highway, lots of parking (especially for big trucks with ladders and equipment), and decent A/V equipment. They actually didn't do a great job on that front, but for the other things it was great.  But let's get down to what matters. The food was good and the atmosphere was not what one would expect for a bar our near the airport - pleasant and friendly, and clean. From the moment we arrived for the event we had a senior waitress assigned to us who really took care of everything and made sure our team, as well as our 120 or so guests were super happy. They all seemed to have walked away happy at the end of it. Well done folks!"}
{"text":"I went to Arizona's because of a layover in Toronto and wished I had chosen another of the many options in the area. The bartender was rude and very difficult to get her attention.   It seemed like I waited an hour for nachos that were quite boring, with very little toppings. The pool balls were chipped and the tables were in bad condition."}
{"text":"Most things I have tried on the menu are very tasty.  There are plenty of big screens to watch sporting events.  You have to get there before noon for lunch if you are in a hurry, else, you can sit back and enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I work I skip and a hop away from this place, so I visit it every now and then. The place is big, and it gets busy on weekends which is why I only go on Mondays, as I really don't enjoy the \"scene\" at this specific bar.   The other reason why I only go on mondays, and always with a group of work friends is because as anyone who frequents 'Zonas knows, Mondays is 1/2 price wings. That's right, jumbo wings at 1/2 the price. This, plus a couple of beers is a nice way to cap off what very often can be stressful days and evenings at work.   I haven't really tried much else from the menu except the wings, and I think I may have had the potatoe skins and nachos once, but they must have been nothing special, as I really don't have a clear recollection of eating them, then again maybe I was already a few beers in when I ate them, and that's why my memory is so foggy."}
{"text":"Not the best meal I've had. I ordered the fish and chips. Okay, my fault for ordering that at this type of restaurant. It was not good, but here's the deal; neither were the fries.   My colleague ordered the wings and I will say they looked very good - big and juicy. Still, there are better places near the Toronto airport to get a meal."}
{"text":"Good food, average service. My boyfriend ordered the suicide wings and they were barely even hot. They had chili peppers hanging off of them and barely no sauce. I had the chicken ceaser wrap which was good and their fries were good too. Pretty expensive for a pitcher of beer though, like $19 for coors light. Nothing exceptional about this place, just average pub food and sports bar feel."}
{"text":"Wings were crispy and dry rub was good. Bartenders/staff were attentive and atmosphere was lively for a Tuesday night. I come to the area often and will try other places but this place will be on my list to come back to at some point."}
{"text":"Awesome despite...  The ubiquitous owner Frank.  This Lurch impersonator is an absolute waste of oxygen!  He's abusive to his staff and mistreats them knowing that as immigrants they have somewhat limited options.  Add to the mistreatment of these poor girls the fact that this turd doesn't care about the customers.  I watched him tell a diner to \"leave if you don't like it!\"  The customer kept saying, \" I just want you to cook me another one that's not raw!\"    The guy was made to leave...SAD"}
{"text":"Arizonan dive bar .  Wait I think that's not the real name but ... It should be .  The only restaurant open when my plane landed . My coworker and I went here.  Prices were fair , food was ok and the atmosphere was divey.  No air conditioning and poor service it wasn't bad but hey midnight in Toronto , what do u expect ?"}
{"text":"Why so few stars Yelp? Nowhere to eat after getting in late on a Sunday night...really apprehensive to try a 2.5 star place but this place was awesome!    Drunk fratty bros playing pool to the right of me, insanely loud winos to the left of me, adorable and helpful waitress, and TONS of beers on tap decently priced! Fine for families if you're okay with a little risqu√© entertainment. :P For the boys: seems like all the waitresses could work at Hooters too...if ya catch my drift ;)  Wings and fish and chips were great, oysters on special were surprisingly fresh and not gritty. Get \"suicide\" wings cause \"spicy\" just wasn't spicy at all.  But I love spicy.  Bathrooms are HUGE and so clean! Totally not expecting that with the ratio of drunk to sober people. This place would definitely be fun to come play drunk free *read FREE* pool, or watch a football game on the huge TVs.  Free wifi: screen name is \"guest\", password is \"arizona\""}
{"text":"Rude owner! I'm a service employee that is well traveled and friendly to all. This place is very plain with a sports bar type atmosphere that can be very comforting. However, this place needs an attitude adjustment. There are dingy pool tables, mediocre food and a great expensive beer selection. The owner knocked over one of my coworkers beers on a pool table and passively walked off with no apology or acknowledgment of his mistake or our presence for that matter. Airline crews who come by these types of joints are very friendly and kind. Unfortunately, we were treated with disrespect from the owner, not to mention the way he was barking orders at the very polite wait staff. As if they were slaves.  If the owner didn't have greedy dollar signs in his eyes, and a disrespectful, socially inept demeanor then I'd be back. If you do go, tip the wait staff and tell them you are sorry their boss sucks and that they deserve better. You deserve better too, so skip this place and go somewhere that deserves your business. It's a shame to see a business ran so poorly."}
{"text":"came here to catch the late football game.  service was great, but other than the chicken bites - the food wasn't.   bruschetta - the bread was warm; the rest felt slapped together.  mussels - WAY too much tomato sauce! It felt like a can of pasta sauce was dumped over the mussels and warmed up.  chicken bites - they were fresh and tossed in wing sauce was good!   would I return? only for drinks."}
{"text":"Half price wings Monday are always good. The waitresses are beautiful and friendly."}
{"text":"Lousy experience.  Didn't think you could go wrong ordering a pizza until I ate here.  We didn't have to pay for the pizza, and ordered a salad to go. Even the salad was disappointing. Maybe the burgers are good?"}
{"text":"Sat there for 15 minutes without a waitress bringing a menu.  Gave up and went to Lone Star Grill."}
{"text":"It's weird, all the negative reviews on this place. I have stayed in hotels close by and stayed away.  Finally wandered in , expecting a dive bar. Nothing even close.  Place is a cool sports bar.  Food is good.  It's clean, staff is attentive, great beer selection and it's nice inside. Classy pool tables stone faced walls, tons of TVs.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"got to local hotel late (1:00 am) walked over to this place and was happily surprised to find that they were not only still serving beer - they were still serving the full kitchen menu  I was quickly served by a friendly bar tender I think Kayla was her name.  food was great, service great - I will be coming back again next time I am here."}
{"text":"Worst fish n chips I've every had.  Fish was overcooked and freezer burnt.  I asked the server how the fish n chips were, her answer should have clued me in, \"its a nice sized piece of haddock.\"  Yes it was a very large piece of fish.   Never again Arizona... I should have stuck with the apps and a salad."}
{"text":"The worst bar,the beer on the tap is with no gas..specially I ordered for Heineken,when I ask for the reason the guy working there answered recklessly.The worst place believe me guys.....No hospitality*No quality of drinks*No quality of food...No1 worst bar...."}
{"text":"I seem to have a thing for happy hour.   I've never been to Arizona's outside of their happy hour menu time frame, so I can't speak to the early afternoon or the later evening atmosphere or menu, but as far as happy hour here goes.   I'm addicted to their chicken morsels, there quality control is a bit wonky,  as sometimes they are much spicier then others, sometimes they are very saucy, and sometimes the flavouring is baked on,   but I've never not liked them.   Their house rose wine is very light and tasty, and makes for a great start to the weekend when going on a Friday after work.   The atmosphere is a general bar type, so sometimes it is loud, and sometimes it is a bit more mellow.   The wait staff is generally good, although sometimes they can be slow,  we've had a few times were we had to remind them about missing orders and they sometimes get my drink order wrong,  but that could be because when I'm not drinking wine I drink vodka and ginger ale, and who does that?    In fact the only reason I give them a 3 and not a 4 star rating is the few times the wait staff was not on the ball,   but even when they are a bit slow or off, they are always very friendly and outgoing."}
{"text":"First time visiting this restaurant and most certainly our last. The hostess was non responsive when we asked for a table for two. Our server is nowhere to be found. The chicken parm tastes like burnt cardboard, the prime rib burger the bum was hard as a rock filling apart. The meat tastes like a dogs fart. The restaurant is dark and dirty. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"This might be one of the worst restaurants I've ever been to. I went with three friends and from the start everything was horrible. The service sucked. She never cleared our glasses or bottles. We always had to ask her for refills. She would leave without offering anything or asking what we may need. Everything came extremely slow. The steak was a ribeye that was so pathetic looking and tasting. Was ordered medium rare but was so thin that there is no way it could have come any way but well done. When we got the bill there was extra items on it. Other employees came over and kept talking to her so we couldn't even check out. Was a horrible experience. The staff is very unprofessional and the food just sucks."}
{"text":"The waitress was friendly however there is definitely an issue with the delivery. Our group never received our appetizers, half our group still has not received their food and the rest is still in waiting. This is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Hmmm.. I've had better. I don't mind dive bars. And this is a dive. The restaurant was just plain. Nothing special... the decor and the patio were kinda out dated. Starting from the plain white laminated menus in a boring truck stop font needs to be changed. The owners need to spend a little money to spruce up the joint. Not really a family place, more of \"hi I'm here to drink\" place. Which is fine, everyone is entitled to do what they gotta do. The food was ok.. I had the Prime Rib Burger and the wife had fish and chips. The fish plate was brought out without tartar sauce.. just a piece of beer battered fish and fries.. no side of coleslaw or anything. The plate just seemed boring.. a reflection on the restaurant. My prime rib burger was tasty.. seemed just like the PC brand Prime Rib frozen burgers in a box. On the menu said it comes with grilled onions and horseradish. Not I big fan of those two so I asked for pickles, lettuce and tomato which the waitress brought me when I asked. Again, it was just a burger with fries. Something I expect from a fast food burger joint... I thought a \"bar and grill\" would spruce it up a bit with a nice coleslaw in the side. The service was great. Our server was pleasant and prompt and was always smiling. She came by our table often to see if we needed anything. She was also dressed that her gazongers weren't hanging out like the other girls there. I guess they feel that they have to complete with Hooters a few doors down. To me, I don't think that is a selling point. Anyways, I won't be going back there because the Griswold family wagon doesn't go back to places unless it's one of our FAVOURITE places. I guess it's place that you can grab a beer and watch the game and hang out in the presence of good friends... sometimes that's all the matters."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink with coworkers on a wed night. Pretty crowded and rather hot. Music was loud. Server was nice and prompt. Ordered the bbq riblets--tough and dry. Had to send them back. Ordered nachos. Another miss. Prices were outrageous too. Maybe that's just a Canada thing. $19 for a pitcher of bud light?! Insane. Not many options around this side of Toronto airport but keep looking..."}
{"text":"Ordered appetizers and drinks.  App's were low quality and not worth finishing. Left for another nearby restaurant and managed to salvage the evening."}
{"text":"This is a regular spot for me. Can't go wrong with half priced wings on Mondays which are huge. They also have $1 oysters on Tuesdays. This place has lots of tv's so you won't miss out on any games. Service here is mostly good but their are times when you wait forever to have a waitress come and take your order after being seated. I found out why from an ex employee. Apparently the waitresses select which table they want to serve. If your young looking or of Caribbean, Asian or indian decent they judge you and think you will be a poor tipper so they try to avoid you and wait for another waitress to get to you first."}
{"text":"Very interesting and festive grill. The food was burnt but the waitresses were voluptuous. Interesting enough the hooters was just down the street. The waitresses were very good looking though but were not very intelligent in my opinion.   Probably go back there when I'm around Pearson lol"}
{"text":"Visited here on a Friday Night.  Had heard a bit about this place so decided to go on a girls night here.   The atmosphere is a typical bar, but the space is huge, and the dance floor is small. Nevertheless, the music was decent with top 40s.   This place lost its stars when it came to their food and their watered down mixed drinks. Next time, I would just order beer or wine in hopes that they are not watered down as well."}
{"text":"This bar is a convenient location near the highways and airport.  There are a number of TVs playing sports and it gets packed when a game is on.  The place is pretty big and has a large patio plus pool tables and other games in doors.  The best time to come is 3:30 to 6 when there are half price appetizers.  I was lucky enough to be there on a Wednesday and they had a one dollar special for Malpeque oysters.  Our group ordered 40 and then another 15.  I ate the last three and could have kept going."}
{"text":"Dont go expecting a top notch gourmet meal..typical bar food is what you will get..bar staff are great..seems to be a regular turnover with the wait staff"}
{"text":"Fairly busy bar/grille type hang out, right underneath the approach path to runways 24 Left and Right at Toronto. Outside seating area is tolerable, tables are sticky and so are the menus. Wait staff not very attentive, but appears bilingual. Beers are cold and food is very average, typical bar fare. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Half off on appetizers on certain time of the day. Be sure to know, its only the first half of the list of appetizers menu for that promotional deal. They never mentioned it on their ads, only after you order.  The interior of the restaurant is nice. Spacious. They got two pool tables and lots of TVs.  The servers were friendly.   I got... Spinach house dip, BBQ riblets, and pasta  (chicken, sausages, mushrooms, and tomatoes sauce)"}
{"text":"This is the worst service I have ever seen. It took us an hour to realize we won't get ANY service, so we went to the manager who was quite helpful to separate us from the group we're allegedly a part of and finally get a table. After talking to the manager service was much better and people got really nice. However, it took another 30 minutes to get the order on tne table, which is probably understandable, as the place was truly busy at that time.  Bottom line, if you're looking for a service (on a date for example), keep looking..."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover. I was in Toronto recently for myson's hockey tourney.  When I first arrived at the hotel my wife and I made fun of this place as we thought it was a sleazy hookup bar for want to be Toronto cowboys.    The team decided to go there one night for dinner and I quickly learned I was wrong.  The service was fantastic, the food was very good and the prices were the best around.  They were very good to the kids too and they played pool in the backroom we were in.    After spending three days in Toronto I became very critical of the food in this town.  For the third largest city in North America they have small town food.  I was very happy with the steak I ordered at Arizona B-Bar and everyone was happy with what they had.   Lots of TVs with sports on all channels.  If you are staying by YYZ I highly recommend Arizona B-Bar and Grill."}
{"text":"The food and service were somewhere between less than average and average. One of the people in my party asked for a water twice and never received it. I had to ask twice and finally got one. I ordered the hamburger, which was actually good, but the roll was so bready that I needed that water to swallow each bite. The fries were hot and crispy, which was nice to balance off the burger. There has to be a better choice than going back there again."}
{"text":"Good service. Typical pub food.  Large space, lots of TVs, a few pool tables. I would go again."}
{"text":"The good: - Atmosphere and patio were good, good for plane spotters - Service was decent, although they did make a mistake on the bills  The bad: - Burger was awful. Stale bun, grey meat that was dried out, toppings were terrible as well (shredded lettuce from a bag, pickle didn't even taste like a pickle). Burger is supposed to come with mayo, but it didn't. No condiments brought out with burger.  - Fries were soggy, again nothing on table so no salt/pepper/vinegar. Vinegar was brought in a small cup. - Ordered a beef dip to go, when I got home, there was no dip for the beef dip, although the meat and bread were marginally better than the burger.   Would not return, especially for food."}
{"text":"giving this place 2 stars only because the wings are very good and they are accommodating to find your own specific sports team ( since they have every sporting event that is televised) other than that, service is horse shit. Waited 20 min at stable to get a menu and another 15 for someone to take my order. Wait staff is attractive but not very intune of thier jobs.  Highly suggest not going I Here on a busy night, unless you are in no fricking hurry."}
{"text":"Food is ok here, prices are reasonable. The place needs updating, everything looks old and run down. The bigger sized room is free for renting which is really good for parties/events. Service was alright. The pool table was old and the worst part was they didn't have proper pool balls - there were a few too many stripes in the batch. When I was going for a smoke the waitress practically chased me down yelling trying to hand me a receipt when I wasn't even leaving, also there were many others staying behind it's not like we all left. The soft drinks/ iced tea was really watered down and they charge for refills which is such a scam. Wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"I generally don't set my expectations too high when it comes to airport strip bars. Somehow I expected my experience St the Arizona B to be at least passable since they have been there for a very long time. They must be doing something right....right? I sat in their outside patio which was pleasant. I had a great view of the planes landing on runway 24R. I ordered the BBQ Bison Burger which was described in the menu as a leaner choice of meat. What was brought to me nearly made me fall out of my chair. It was nothing less than a store bought, frozen, hamburger patty with BBQ sauce brushed on it. Most fast food restaurants serve real fresh ground beef. Not only was this not fresh but it was not even bison. Even worse they charged $12. I have never been in a restaurant that did not make it's hamburger patties by hand. To place what they did in front of me was like saying \"screw you, we don't want your business\". And I assure you they will never have it again."}
{"text":"Good service, but surprisingly limited draft selections and pretty average bar food. Half-price appetizers until 6:30 was nice with boneless chicken chipotle pretty tasty, but riblets just okay. I had Thai chicken curry (salty, but not particularly spicy) while my son had Chimichangas, which he liked.  To be fair, it was stumbling distance, even in a snowstorm, from the Courtyard, and they absolutely accommodated our wish to watch the Devils/Hurricanes hockey via satellite on MSG+. Good choice if you are willing to trade good food against good sports, and pretty good value, but the food is barely average bar food. Jack Daniels and Jameson made a digestive and warmth for the snow blown walk back to the hotel."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday. Hoping for a good meal and good night after a long week but it was disappointment after disappointment.  I ordered the prime rib with mash potatoes and my friend ordered lamb with potatoes. The food took a really long time to come out. Even had to asked the server how much longer it will be. Finally 40 minutes later our food comes. I asked my prime rib to be medium and my friend asked her lamb to be medium rare. Both were dry to the bone. Anyone that knows a good prime rib, knows they should be juicy as hell and medium rare should be bleeding.  I expressed my dissatisfaction to our server and she suggested if maybe we wanted an HP sauce! That's not going to fix my meat. She took it back and again waited for our food. This time the meat was probably dryer than before and we had rice on our plates and no potatoes?? The server finally came to check up on us and I asked why we had rice. She said the kitchen ran out of potatoes and they gave us whatever they had left. Could she not have relayed this information to us before hand?  At this point I had to speak to a manager. Showed him our food, he agreed it was dry and voided our bills. There was no way I was paying anyways.  Also, bus boy clearing tables was clearing EVERYTHING. Being so inconsiderate. Glasses full of water my friends were still drinking, plates of food they were still picking at. I had a glass of water right next to me, clearly mine and he asked if it was mine. Really?  Never coming back. Hopefully I won't have to attend any other birthdays here."}
{"text":"Went to Arizona's a couple nights ago for some late night wings and a roach walked out of our plate after all of us at some. A roach, we are certain because we crushed it. We were sitting at the front bar and it might have come out on either the celery or from behind the bar. Unacceptable. Worst part, the manager fixed it by knocking the wings off of our tab. We had the dead body of the cockroach in a napkin. The health department should pay this place a visit. Don't go here. Don't risk it."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Place was dead and couldn't get a beer for more than 15 mins until we had to ask the bartender who our waitress was. Plenty of them around but they seemed more interested in chatting amongst themselves then service customers.   Ordered wings. Get this. If you get hem on separate 1 pound plates they will do a flavour per pound. Order 2 pounds at once and they won't do half and half. Why? So they can charge you more. Stupid  Wings were large and so so. Gave me heartburn. Fries were okay but holy what a small serving for $5!  The waitress was so bad at her job. She really needs to find another job. So bad in fact she botched our whole bill. We wanted to leave so bad we didn't even realize until we got home.   Was supposed to be 1/3 price wings. She charged FULL PRICE!    We had a total of 5 beers. She charged us for 4.   I wish it would have been to our benefit but it wasn't. We still got ripped off.    The owner was getting short with the girls because a table of 8 people were waiting half hour before they even had someone go to their table and only after he got upset.   This place used to be the best in the area. Now it's just a dive with terrible service and subpar food that's overpriced.   (Where's a Zantac??? I need one so bad)"}
{"text":"Came here for a Christmas lunch not expecting much after reading for reviews.  I was surprise by the atmosphere in the restaurant, it looks way better inside than it does outside.  The service was good overall, not much to complain.  Now for the food, I order the reuben sandwich with fries.  There was a generous portion of smoked meat in the sandwich, however the bottom of the bread was soggy.  It might have been because of the large party that we had and they waited to take all our meals out at once.  Overall, the food is mediocre and the prices were average, but the d√©cor is fairly nice.  I wouldn't come back for seconds, but if you're in the area and just want a place to chill and have drinks it might be worth coming since they have lots of TV's and a pool table for you to pass time."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I decided to visit this place for drinks. It was a typical sports bar, quite noisy, lots of TVs, pool tables, etc. The food was average. We all had appetizers, (which are half price during happy hour!) they were ok. They had a decent beer selection as well. The service was good, our waitress was very nice. We were also there during a Raptors playoffs game so it was pretty busy but the staff seemed to be handling it well."}
{"text":"There Guinness BBQ wing sauce is amazing. The portion of wings is more than enough with 1.3 pounds.   This is a great place to watch any sporting event."}
{"text":"hmmm my experience was so so. been here in the past to have drinks and play pool many times but have never eaten anything. today i came to dine and ordered the \"ponderosa penne\"  hated it. not because it didn't taste good but because i didn't get my meal the way i ordered it. it came with onions and mushrooms, both i hate, so i asked to exclude it which they said was fine. meal came for my son but i had to wait because they put onions in my dish. waited the additional 5 minutes but my plate had onions and mushrooms in it. anyway i picked my way through my plate.  i was prepared to cuss when my bill came but they left it off yeeeeeea.  ill be back to play pool though... not to eat."}
{"text":"I have visited this place three times and I can honestly say that my third time coming here which was yesterday is the last time that I'll be coming to this establishment. First off the waitress that was serving me and my friend acted like it wasn't really her job to serve us we had to wait a long time to get her to notify her that we would like our bill and it took so long I was so tempted to just walk out. The food was OK but it was really the service that turned me off .the waitress barely spoke to us it's like it was pulling teeth for her to even say hello or to have any sort of common courtesy she didn't come to check in to see how we're doing if we're enjoying our food nothing like that. I also count determine whether she was just wearing a t shirt or a dress it was so short I couldn't tell. Gross"}
{"text":"I was never impressed with this place, great parking but terrible service. The atmosphere at one point used to be like bar/club and it could be a fun night out but I think it's been a while since that place saw those days!  It is large but I think it works against them becaause it does make it harder for the staff to maintain their areas. Plus I do agree that they have not done enough in the way of upgrades to fix the blaring problems.  The patio is nice but without a decent menu to serve the place is essentially wasted, especially considering your just a few steps from some pretty stiff competition and a fair few options."}
{"text":"This place is NOT a do-over. It's been there for years but for the life of me...I don't know why. It's old, it's dirty & the food is over priced & mediocre at best. There are sooo many good Toronto Airport restaurants don't do this one!"}
{"text":"Alright, here comes a big one  I have been to Arizonas many times. Mainly because it's close to home, plays the hockey games or UFC fights on big enough screens, and has good food  This is a two part review  Good things: The food at Arizonas is always tasty and the menu is HUGE so there's surely something for everyone. I recommend the pizzas, the half price apps, or the wings.  The atmosphere during a game is great cause a lot of people are there to watch so it has a sports-bar excitement about it There are a lot of TVs, you will see no matter where you sit   Bad things: Service is never great. I feel like they hire pretty girls who don't really feel they have to work at their best to serve customers. I've found most people seem annoyed or unfriendly when asked things and seem preoccupied and like they don't have the time for you The service while they're busy is even worse- this time even effecting food prep (we came on a busy night once and my bruschetta (picture posted) was SOOO skimpy and not worth the money)  The sound boxes that you can ask for at your table so you can hear the game/fight on tv sometimes don't play the right channel and no one seems to care to help no matter how much you ask The atmosphere on weekend NIGHTS turns dark and loud with beats blaring- almost like a club- which is very annoying on a night where the place ADVERTISED they were playing the UFC fight (I'm just saying)   Aoo I mean, good food, I go a lot, but sometimes it's really shit. Service is the biggest problem id say. And volume of the music when half the people in the place aren't there for that- they're there to watch a sporting event"}
{"text":"OK for drinks with a decent atmosphere.  The food and service are mediocre."}
{"text":"Umm beer was cold.. need i say more ? Not even what i would consider good bar food.  Calamari was okay hot the moment it began to cool it went stringy. Chicken was yumm lets not talk about it. Rice with burrito like hospital food. First time and last.. Good staff and pleasant environment but other than that.. skip it."}
{"text":"Actually after looking at the rating of this place, I thought oh well ... I'm stranded here after 8 hours in the airport and ny flight got cancelled.... so, 12:30 am, not much more if you wanted a bite.... so, yes I cane in and a beautiful lady Ashley took super care of me!  Beer... got it, too warm though.... so some ice (I know!! Ice!!!) well it got better... she recommended the grilled guac chicken sandwich with greek salad on the side! Actually VERY good!! ciabatta bread that  was tender and fresh.... so, high 5 for her and the place!!! Opened until late it was a treat... so, all in all, don't hesitate to come here.... Ambiance? Ok! And the place is clean.... Enjoy"}
{"text":"Good service. Patio is nice. Music was too loud. Got the BBQ Guinness wings. Suicide was unbearably hot. My mouth was swollen after. It wasn't the best and not the worst. Good place to watch sports. The place turns into a club on Fridays and Saturdays. They also have 1 buck oysters on Wednesday and Thursdays."}
{"text":"Fun place! Great big screens for all games. Pour a good cocktail. Food is bar food solid. Great staff of waitresses are personable and efficient.   I will be back again next time!"}
{"text":"I have been to Arizona twice. The first time was a couple of summers ago. After my performance review from my boss, he suggested that we come here for appetizers. They are half-price from 3:30 pm till 6:30 pm. We got there at 6 pm.  We ordered wings, bruschetta, calamari, and potato skins. They were all delicious. I washed everything down with a Stella Artois on tap, which is my chosen beer. My manager followed suit. It was an enjoyable time out on the patio on a warm summer night, chatting and eating.  It is still a bit strange that my boss is also my friend. It works out.  Last month, my colleagues and I came here to welcome a couple of new contractors to our team. I ordered the veal sandwich with fries. The veal sandwich was yummy. The fries were not. I left half of them on my plate.  I think that I will stick with going here for appetizers.  (231)"}
{"text":"This place is huge, they have lots of beer on tap, lots of screens, and good wings which are 1/2 price on Mondays. All week they have half price apps until 18:30. Wings were pretty good and the waitress was stacked. win win.   Good place to bring the soccer team after a game."}
{"text":"Went Sunday for the games. 3 of us asked for 2 games on 2 TV's. We were the only customers when we sat down. No problem, turned them on, got our beers. There are many tv's, only cared about 2. They don't know how to run the tv's. They changed ours 6 times. Then waitress disappeared for 10-15 minutes at a time. 3 times we had to get other waitresses to get her for us. It wasn't busy, she had 3 tables. she went outside at least 3 times, for what,  I don't know. Wings were ok at best. Friend ordered Philly cheese steak, they gave him pulled pork. Service was horrible. 1st 10% tip I left in probably 20 years and that was generous. Next Sunday, they don't get our business. Too bad for them, we are on unlimited expense accounts."}
{"text":"This place was horrible. D√©cor looks decent enough and friendly, like an updated sports bar.  My party of 2 sat at the bar on a weekday, during their happy hour time so appetizers were half price.  To get a waitress to serve us was a challenge.  Although each one of the waitresses seemed to have a boyfriend they were sitting on laps of around tables  or kissing, adjacent to us. none seemed to want to even offer us menus. When we finally got menus it took another 15 minutes for the waitress to come back to take an order.  Food came out within a reasonable amount of time maybe 10 minutes and was satisfactory, especially for the 50% price, but being surrounded by waitresses that were groping the people at the tables around us was truly unprofessional and borderline offensive.   I'd like to think this was out of the ordinary but these patrons were acting like they owned the place and it was their regular thing to do afterwork- NEVETR AGAIN"}
{"text":"Staying at a hotel near Toronto's airport, I found myself alone in my bed on a Sunday night, watching Karate Kid on the TV...Before Daniel-san was waxing Miyagi's car, I called downstairs for a cab and a recommendation for a local bar.    Arizona Bar was recommended and only a 5 minute cab ride from most area hotels (it's extremely close to the airport).  It was a night filled with ice cold Canadians (the beer, not the staff) and flirty bartenders who teased the locals as well as travellers throughout the night.  Sitting at the bar, I met quite a few people...  Watched quite a bit of hockey that night, and learned about the Nicaraguan economy.  As the bar closed down, I found it hard to get a cab, so I went to a near by donut shop, grabbed a bite and had the gentleman there ring me one..."}
{"text":"Leaving the Toronto Congress Centre, my large group and I decided to stop by Arizona to grab dinner and a few drinks.  It was the perfect place because it is very spacious, has AMPLE parking accommodates large groups and has pool tables and tvs all around! Our waitress told us that it was half-price appetizers before 6:30pm (We went on a Wednesday) so we quickly jumped on that and ordered pretty much every apps available to share and sample. I personally ordered the riblets which was great for the price I paid.   While waiting for our entrees, we kicked back and watched the FIFA game that was on, drank and played pool (free, just ask the front desk for the balls). Time flew and here came our MASSIVE entrees. I felt like I was eating in the States seeing those large portions.  The stuffed chicken I ordered was decent and by the time I wanted to sample my boyfriend's Mixed Grill which came with steak, chicken and lamb, I was just too full from the appetizers.  In my opinion, it's a great place to have drinks as their beer list is extensive and great to enjoy half-price apps."}
{"text":"Very good looking bar.  Good atmosphere.  Downside is that the menu has way too many items on it. No way the fry cook in back can make each item well. Ordered a simple pizza and it was a step above a frozen pizza option.  Service was poor. Original waitress was MIA.  Had to go to the bar myself to get another drink. Eventually just moved to the bar so I could order dinner. Service there was good. If they had a manager that actually managed the kitchen and the staff this place could have potential."}
{"text":"This place gets bashed on the reviews a lot.  I kind of like it.  I've been going here for more years than anyone should admit. It's a simple place.  Lots of booze.  Kind of edible foods.  Lots of servers - with no real dress code.  The normal average people would not be here.  If you're looking for a night club, or a classy hang out bar, or fine dining, or great food...uh....you might consider this place one of those things, however, for the most part....go somewhere else.  Yes...a lot of the servers have attitudes, some fun, some not, but that's Arizona's.  I've been going here off and on for so long, I'm insulated from all that.  This is the place where you meet the gang.  Have a bunch of drinks, get 1/2 price appy during happy hour.  Shoot pool on dirty but free tables.  Set your expectations to mild, and just enjoy the music and the company  Plenty of free parking too!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"average eatery, with above average service.  the food is bland most of the time, but you can score half price apps before 1830. a great place to get drinks though, and just to further drive the point home, it seems like the servers are more attentive to the people drinking alcohol, as apposed to the people eating food...which is sad to point out. great place to watch sports as well.  lots of parking, and they keep the place pretty clean, quite hidden from the main strip of the airport as well. sometimes can get a bit loud with the planes landing."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday, it wasn't busy at all in the lunch hour, not what it use to be in my hay days 20 years ago. The staff are very slow in taking orders, plus no condiments on the table, I had to wait literally 10 min for ketchup. I ordered the Arizona burger and my dad preferred the chicken penne. He enjoyed his meal, as my burger just tasted bland and simple, although it was filling."}
