{"text":"This is probably one of the best places to buy halal meat and Indian-Pakistani groceries in the Southeast.   We always get friendly service and the store is well-kept and well-stocked.   Meat is great quality and we would gladly recommend Holy Joes to anyone."}
{"text":"These guys are great and the proprietor (I never found out if his name is actually Joe) is such a friendly guy.  The meat is outstanding, the lamb and chicken I've gotten there has been better than any meat I've found in Charlotte and I've been to Whole Foods, various Halal butchers and high end grocery stores.  Be sure to call ahead and let them know what you want since they cut it fresh and it takes about 30-45 minutes.  Or, if you're like me, you can go have some Indian food nearby at Adisil or Curry n Cake.  They don't have a lot in the way of groceries and spices but they do carry a fair number of the essentials but in honesty, go there for the meat."}
{"text":"If you are pressed for time or want to avoid long lines and looking to prepare a meal your family will love, than Holy Joes is the place to shop. I am most impressed by how much time shopping here saves me. I know that shopping here my food is fresh and I can avoid long lines."}
{"text":"Best quality meat in university area.. Well organized... Neat and clean store with friendly service.. If they are out of meat they will ask for your phone number and call you, by the time you reach there you're order is packed and ready for pick up..."}
{"text":"Came here for lamb chops.  FINALLY a meat market in charlotte that offers one of my favorite foods.  Staff was so nice and friendly.  My lamb chips were amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Worth each penny. Fresh meat and chicken. Order half an hour befor pickup, and they will give the fresh chicken cut into pieces."}
{"text":"The food here is of good quality and the selection is nice enough also.  Only reason this doesn't get 4 stars is because the prices at the butcher are very very high.  Be prepared to spend 30% more than what you would pay at harris teeter."}
{"text":"I got so horrible meat from this place. I had to throw away half of what I brought. It had only bones and it was not cut properly which lead to oozing lots of blood while cooking. 
I was so frustrated that I threw away as it was waste of masalas cooking just bones in blood."}
{"text":"Clean, thorough and quick.... All the qualities I look for in a butcher and Holy Joes has it all!  I needed some goat for the holidays(because thanksgiving just isn't thanksgiving without the curry goat) they take orders over the phone and online which is awesome but I prefer to see what I'm buying before I buy it.... No problem because the glass windows allow you to see the preparation of your meat as well.  The man with whom I dealt was courteous and kind and seemed to have a lot of regulars coming through.  They had a nice sized market of other products that you might find in and Arabic or Indian store like soaps, henna, rice, flour drinks etc. I only took off one star for the prices... I have never paid so much for goat in my life but in Charlotte, not a lot of butchers sell it so I guess he can charge what he wants and it is selling.  I would go back because the quality was GREAT and we need curry goat in our lives and I do believe that I got what I paid for"}
{"text":"Severely disappointed. I was told by some that this is one of the best places for halal goat and I went today to get $50 worth the baby goat back leg. What I got instead is certainly not that. The meat took FOREVER and still didn't cook even though I cooked it in the pressure cooker! I know how to make goat and this just was not fresh at all! AThis was not baby goat as the owner promised and certainly not fresh. He said he was wiped out because someone got 50lbs from him yesterday but gave me the last bit he had. What I got was not even close to edible. For me it was huge mistake to try a new place. Spoiled my entire Sunday plans, so disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best place in this part of the town if you are looking for mutton, lamb or chicken. Have been buying meat from this place, it's very fresh and the always comes out great. Highly recommended if you are cooking at home and looking for great meat."}
