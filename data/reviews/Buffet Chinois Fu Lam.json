{"text":"Having dined at this location numerous times, last two times have encountered issues,1)temperature of hot and sour soup Luke warm even after mention to staff found same problem last visit 2) General Tao chicken had no chicken just fried dough want back to get more to make sure it may have been random , cut into 10 pieces no chicken ,  Will not be back ."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Fu Lam used to offer good food at a reasonable cost but while the cost is still reasonable, what passes as food is not.  The last few orders were disasters.  The General Tao chicken was tough as nails, the Won Ton was tasteless and everything else was either overcooked or undercooked.  Fu Lam was one of our favourite places for take out as well as dining in but I'm afraid we've struck them off our list.  One bad meal can be excused, two gives you cause for pause but three?  That's pushing the envelope beyond what we find to be acceptable."}
{"text":"Had dinner here the other night for a family celebration.  I ordinarily do not patronize Chinese buffet style eateries.  Was happy to see that they have a short order cook on a grill as part of the buffet, ala Mongolian BBQ style.  The offerings aren't as plentiful though you may select fresh veggies from the salad bar for your stir fry.  Sushi was good, was pleased to see this as well.  The rest of the buffet was a hodge podge including pizza and French fries next to the pot stickers and egg rolls.  The dessert offerings looked picked over and tired.  Atmosphere typical for this type of establishment.  I would probably not return if given a choice.  Sometimes you go along with the prevailing sentiment."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Highlights include nice smoked meat that you can carve for yourself and a nice selection of food that they seem to take care of. Low include the fact that they seem to waste a lot of food because they refuse to label the food. Yes, it's mystery food time! Seriously... you have to guess what things are. What if you had allergies? What I thought might be chicken.... fish! A few dishes could use a little help and maybe an update. But otherwise it's a solid chinese buffet when you have that craving for cheap chinese fare ala all you can stomach. The service was good."}
{"text":"The quality is  very poor, nothing of choice quality poorest cuts of all meat products. My opinion quite an unhealthy place."}
{"text":"The prices are very high now and seems the food quality went down a lot. I think moving forward I will stick to take out instead of eating in. They need a lot more varieties for the price they charge. The good needs to be warmer and also better desserts options"}
{"text":"The actual restaurant is in a shopping center right next to a Dollorama store where Fu Lam probably get all their food from...  If you like to eat enormous quantity of very bland over re-heated slop, than this is the place for you! No atmosphere here at all.  No lineup on Mother's day? That's probably not a good sign. Surrrounded by obese people stuffing themselves, children running in the alleys, servers waiting to pick up your empty plates and give you icy water and stares. The buffet always seem half empty, whole isles without any food on it. All this for about 20$, so it won't break the bank, but it will definitely get you full and sleepy and give you nightmares from the enormous amounts of MSG they must use. It's cheap and it's sloppy. Don't bring someone you love here. Absolutely no quality here, just quantity."}
{"text":"If you value life...never NEVER eat at buffet Fu Lam. I am appalled at what is served at buffet Fu Lam. The items served at buffet Fu Lam barley passes for \"Americanized\" Chinese food. Nothing seems fresh at Fu Lam. Please avoid eating here, eat somewhere else even McDonald's will do."}
{"text":"the food was fine on a weekend but disastrous on a week day. the weekend price is just 2$ above that of the weekday but the food is much better. less than average customer service."}
{"text":"C'est tellement mauvais comme place, ça n'a aucun bon sens. En revanche, c'est rapide et vraiment pas cher. J'aime un truc là-bas et c'est le bar à faire sauté ce qu'on veut. Ils ont donc un «chef» qui saute dans un wok une protéine qu'on choisit (Poulet, Boeuf, Crevette) et des légumes. Le hic c'Est que c'est souvent une cuisson discutable. C'est juste un style qui est resté dans les années 90's et qui n'a jamais vieillit. J'imagine que c'est en partie à cause du côté sécurisant d'un buffet chinois «américain» mais reste que c'est Bof!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time last night - Similar to other buffets in the area, but there's a wider selection of asian inspired foods like sushi and noodles. There is a wok/grill station where you can pick your own noodles, veggies, meat and sauce and have a chef cook it up for you on the spot. In terms of desserts, I particularly liked their lemon pie and blue bubble gum flavored ice cream - 2 items I haven't encountered at other buffets in Montreal.  If you can fill up on sashimi, you may get your money's worth. It was 18.50$ on a Monday night, I believe the weekend prices go up to 25$ and children below a certain age eat free. Watch out for coupons if you live on the south shore, I've often seen promotions like \"2 can dine\" for a set price in local flyers. They no longer have a website so I would suggest calling them for prices or just walk in to see the food selection."}
{"text":"Ah, Fu Lam Frig What do you expect? This is your typical chinese food buffet. Don't come with expectations of golden dragons and culinary masterpieces. Just come with the munchies! Friendly staff and tasty food"}
