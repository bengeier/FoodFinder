{"text":"Nice spot with amazing ramen! Fried dumplings were way too oily for me, but otherwise everything was good!"}
{"text":"Meilleurs ramen .... c'est tellement bon! Le service peut parfois laisser a désirer et on doit parfois attendre en ligne mais ca vaut la peine. Il est certain qu'on doit aimer les trucs assez salé. Les cha shu fondent dans la bouche !  Je conseille absolument"}
{"text":"Tantan ramen was the best! I've eaten here numerous times and it is by far my favourite. Perfectly spicy and a bit creamier than the others."}
{"text":"I've come often here and my only complaint is one of the waiter... It's as if I didnt really exist. I'm more shocked about this because he is Japanese too. I kinda expect more from him. I've heard other people complain about his attitude. Having been to Japan, this kind of behavior would not be acceptable.  I don't want to sound harsh to the poor guy but man... Show some positive vibes when you serve people in general..."}
{"text":"Got the spicy ramen, couldnt finish it because it was too spicy, had to poor some water in it and it still didnt make any difference. It was salty to the point my stomach started hurting. Worst ramen experience I ever had."}
{"text":"A friend and I tried it for a girls' dinner out. It's probably as good as it gets in terms of authenticity (I was born and raised in Japan). I get that people thought the Shiro-miso broth was too salty but you're not supposed to be able to drink all of it...I don't think. Everything about Shro-miso Cha-shu I had was pretty great: the noodles, the broth, cha-shu slices (3!). Good portion size, too. The only thing was they were quite obviously short-staffed. One more server would have helped a lot. Go there early to avoid a line-up. Will come back."}
{"text":"A good location near McGill and Concordia to get some eats between classes. I thought that Misoya's broth was really tasty and there noodles were quite good as well. I think I am still hung up to pay around $10 for soup without getting a bit more other stuff (for lunch $10 can typically go a bitter farther than this). Overall I gave it three stars because it was tasty but a bit too high of a price for soup."}
{"text":"Great place,  great Ramen  This our second visit and you should try it I have added crunchy tofu and eggs giving it a twist to the saw the great taste of the Ramen Broth"}
{"text":"The soup ramen is salty but the noodles are firm and chewy. The staff are friendly. Clean place. Their food a lil bit pricey."}
{"text":"J'adore leur soupe! Je ne suis pas un expert des ramen, mais c'est très bon et plein de goût. Le prix est autour de 15$ tx. inc. pour une soupe.  Je suggère de prendre la soupe avec les garnitures spéciales (dernier dans la liste); elle vient avec une tranche de porc et un oeuf et ca permet de goûter au deux. Généralement j'ajoute une 3e garniture pour le plaisir."}
{"text":"Came back here 2 months after my first visit.  I tried a different broth, which was very tasty, and the girl serving me was friendly. The only problem was that the machine they use to cook the noodles had broken down and I had to wait about 30 min for my food. No one had warned me about this prior to taking my order. I hope this doesn't happen too often; would like to keep coming back here."}
{"text":"Nice good food to a nice price! Friendly staff! Not the nicest and cosiest restaurant a half stairs down but the food was worth it!"}
{"text":"Great place to get some soup on a cold day.  Tucked away in the basement of an old building on Bishop, it's got plenty of tables. While the decor of the place is not super trendy it is functional (there's a lot of room for seating so its rare that you need to wait for a table).  The staff is really eager and friendly, and were always around to help us out.  I tried the Crunchy Tofu, Karaage and Yasai ramen. The little crunchy fried onion bits with the tofu were great. The Karaage was perfectly cooked, if a little hot when served. The Yasai ramen was very savoury -- the noodles were nice along with the abundant vegetables (mm carrots and cabbage).  I'll be coming back on another cold day. :)"}
{"text":"Heard about this place aaaaaall the way from SF so I was excited to give this place a slurp!   One of the first things people tend to notice is the atmosphere, and I liked how you had take a few steps down to get to this place - reminiscent of izakaya joints in Japan. Chairs are mismatched but whatevs, with ramen joints, it's mostly about the bowl thats in front of you... and YES!!! Nihonjins greeting us. That's usually a good sign, right?  Simple menu... Love! That means they concentrate on their craft by limiting their selection. We got the $12.99 lunch special - you know, after all the add ons.   Daikon salad - Didn't want to be too judgmental but they did slop a whole heck of a lot of the miso sesame dressing. Was hoping that it was at least light in flavor, but it was a bit salty so took the top portion off.  Broth - I looove salt, and my BFF and boyfriend are always telling me high blood pressure, secret killer... Even as a sodium fiend, the kome miso broth was way too salty. Took a sip of my boyfriend's shiro miso and although lighter in flavor, a bit salty. Felt bad but I had to pour some of my water in so I could get spoonfuls of my favorite part.  Noodles - I like the noodles they used and they were perfectly firm!  Egg - My second favorite part after the broth. The yolk was firm but had an oranginess to it so not sure if this is supposed to be an onsen tamago or a soft boiled egg. Wished they had cooked it just a minute less.  Pork Charred Shu - whoa whaaaaaaaaat?? Definitely the Michael Jackson of the show. Aheee heeee... I loved that it got a nice tan on the grill and wasn't too fatty. Reminded me of a Japanese porchetta.  I reeeally wanted to like this place, but found that everything is salty. I'd definitely come back again because I don't believe in trying a place just once and writing it off. Its got a bit of catching up compared to Totto or Ippudo in NYC or Sansotei in Toronto, but it is the best in town. If you're missing ramen, we all know we will be coming back to the best one in town."}
{"text":"Be careful, this place is well-hidden, it's the basement level, go down 5 stone steps to get to entrance.  Went alone for lunch in the middle of the week (Wednesday) and it was nice and quiet.  Service is quick and friendly in a small restaurant, with a nice counter. (Where I sat)   Noodles a bit thicker than I'm used to, but not thick Udon noodles either. Comforting spicy broth, enough to give your lips a tingle but not burn your mouth.   Bowl came in literally 5 minutes, that's what I love about Ramen, it's so simple and quick.  Great Ramen! Had the spicy tantan and I loved every bite! Will be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"Great little spot in basement level of building recommended by locals. All the ramen served to others looked so good as I waited to be seated...there was a 10 min wait..always a good sign. I chose the Tantan -a spicy ramen with a creamy taste. Was exactly what I was looking for. I ordered kimchi on side, which, was too soggy for me."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner around 6 on a weeknight. I ordered their most popular ramen with pork. This had to be the saltiest ramen I have ever had. It looked delicious with the thick slices of pork, and nice firm noodles but the soup was just inedible. It was as if they used sea water instead of regular water for the broth. After the ramen I was so thirsty that I kept waking up for water all night long until the early hours of the morning. I dont think I will ever go back to this restaurant if only for health reasons."}
{"text":"I would never go back to this restaurant... It's not because of the food...Actually, I couldn't concentrate on my ramen because the whole restaurant is full of smoke. I feel like I was sitting in the kitchen and I couldn't even open my eyes because of the spicy smoke. I just wanted to get out ASAP...therefore, the ramen for me was just tasteless..."}
{"text":"My plate was too salty and my friend agreed. They are friendly but I wouldn't recommend this place if you want a good vibe. I guess the decor needs a little TLC. The food was nothing special. That's my personal experience."}
{"text":"This place was somehow touted as the best ramen place in Montreal, and I decided to try it out. Mind you, I've had stellar tasting ramen in Los Angeles while I lived there so my expectations were pretty high. Tsujita LA being the best of the best.  Unfortunately, this place falls way short of what I would call \"the best ramen\" in Montreal. If this is the best, then I'm afraid what the other shops would taste like.  Service was slow, and after looking over the menu, I settled on a chashu komemiso (which I guess is the closest you can get to Tonkotsu ramen). After waiting for a pretty long while, we get our bowls and I immediately zoned in on the chashu. These pieces of pork were actually quite large and white, and though you may feel that you're getting your money's worth - it's not. It's tough meat. Really good chashu meat should be tender and fall apart in your mouth as soon as you take a bite, this meat was tough, pork chop style meat. To me, this signaled that they used cheaper pork meat, and that was a big minus.   The broth was ok, but it was definitely missing some garlic and fatty taste. I also ordered a soft boiled egg and seaweed as that's how I usually eat my ramen, and again was disappointed to see that my egg was not exactly soft boiled. It was more on the hard boiled side, and this was definitely not pre-marinated for a while either.  Call me a ramen snob, I don't care. It just wasn't good. lt was tasteless. I'd be willing to go back to try another bowl, but I'm not expecting much improvement."}
{"text":"Je ne suis allée qu'une fois, mais c'était absolument succulent et je suis prête à y retourner n'importe quand! Il est rare de trouver des soupes repas aussi savoureuses dans un restaurant! Miam."}
{"text":"Affordable. I'm a big fan of japanese ramen & tried almost every ramen in Montreal. I know they can't have the same taste as in Japan but Misoya has the best flavor among them."}
{"text":"Located right next to concordia Uni on bishop Street.  This is the perfect place if you're having a craving for ramen on a cold winter day (or any time)   The menu is simple. The staff are friendly. The service is quick. Personally I like their Curry ramen and tantan one with extra toppings. In the entree I can only recommend the karaage chicken. Hot and crispy chicken on a cold day, can't beat that.   One little negative about this place if you go in group, They don't split item on the bill so let say you ordered 3 items. Someone will need to pay for 2 out of the 3 items .... Just a minor thing."}
{"text":"Food was good but I'm extremely disappointed by the customer service. First time at Misoya and it completely ruined the experience for me. I was waited on by a red-headed waitress, she was rude and unpleasant. I was placed on the bar, in a dark corner right across the bathroom. Tables were emptying and I asked if I could be moved. She told me that because I was just one person I couldn't be seated elsewhere. There were three free tables and many more people were getting up to leave. Throughout my meal, more people came to eat alone and they were happily seated to a table."}
{"text":"A decent ramen place in Montreal just opened!! I've been craving ramen since I've been back in Montreal after living in Japan for a while. My previous trials and errors were unsuccessful, and I had accepted that I wouldn't be getting the ramen I wanted here. Well, this isn't exactly it, but it's quite close!! If you lived in Japan or had a decent ramen before, you'll definitely want to try this out. Here's my [extensive; yes, I was excited!!] review of the shiro miso ramen I tried. I'm pretty sure ramen fans will appreciate the thoroughness of it. ^^  Broth: Pork based broth, offered Hokkaido style or shiro miso style. I tried the shiro miso. While I'm not a shiro miso fan (tonkotsu (hakata) lover all the way), the broth was pretty good. Most ramen broths I've had here were quite watery and taste-less. This one is oily (I'd say average to light compared to range of oiliness you can get in Japan (where it can get almost unbearably oily in some places), if that gives you an idea; it was just fine for me) and had a strong flavor. It also had this weird snail taste though. (some friends of mine tried it and didn't taste it, might just be something that stands out to me)  Noodles: on the bigger side of the range. Firm.  Toppings: with the standard ramen you get a bit of: bamboo shoots (~4-5 small pieces), 1 slice of roast pork (could be a little less lean ^^ ), fried tofu, soy bean sprouts, cabbage and green onions.  All in all, some parts could be improved for me: more of each toppings, fattier pork, getting rid of the snail taste in the broth (personal preference), option to have thinner noodles. The toppings can also make it very expensive very quick. If you add eggs, butter, etc., you can easily get a 20$ bowl of (delicious) ramen.  But apart from that, service is awesome, very friendly and caring, and it wasn't very busy when I went, so not too loud. If you wish to speak Japanese they all seem to speak it so you are good to go, and the waitress, who had this typical japanese mom vibe, actually seemed delighted to realize I spoke it and conversed with me before I left, which was nice. :)  tl;dr: If you're looking for decent ramen in Montreal this is a good place to try it. Atmosphere is pretty neutral (there were people on dates, big groups of friends, I was alone, ...) so it's a convenient place for any kind of dinner/lunch. As people have said it's quite simple, as a space, but it's very clean, efficient, and makes you focus on your food. Note that they don't accept cards yet (as of Jan. '13), so bring cash!  They also had really good lunch deals, planning on coming back at that time."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a shot since. If you had to wait in line, definitely ramen not worth waiting for. The chashu was super fatty compared to ones I had at other ramen places in Montreal. We had asked for to add the Spicy Miso as extra, but it was disappointing as it made the soup totally taste different. We also order agedashi tofu, and it was the most disappointing dish. Instead of the typical silken tofu, firm tofu was used and it tasted disgusting. There're better ramen places in Montreal for sure."}
{"text":"Almost 10/10 (like maybe a 9.9).  Good noodles. Broth is nice, could be a bit saltier but that's just my personal tastes. Pork is good, slightly seared to bring out the flavors. Bamboo shoots looks like they're canned, which is not so good.  Gyoza is average."}
{"text":"Les ramen sont excellentes... ce restaurant m'a été conseillé par un Japonais en visite au Canada.  Le lieu n'est pas terrible ca fait un peu cantine mais qu'est ce que c'est bon. Les prix sont plus que raisonnables"}
{"text":"After a long day of running everywhere, my friend had a craving for ramen.  Upon entering, we were greet in Japanese. So nice haha (thumbs up) We tried the Komemiso (Rice Miso) Hokkaido style (yellowish soup) and KomeMiso (Soybean Miso) Dark and thick :D (LOL)  It both came with Cha siu, egg, bean sprout, etc. I had fried shrimp on mine hehe  Komemiso soup was really nice. I prefer it over the Kome Miso.  The Cha siu is impressive haha. There is a \"grilled\" part and it's HUUUUUUGGGEEEE.  Meat lover right there :D When you deep it in the broth, it's even better.  We also tried the TAKOYAKI, which was in a soup and you could deep it in a sauce. First time seeing this, Originality right there. Personally, I prefer the normal way to do it.  We also tried the tofu. Really nice appetizer. Crispy, tasty, some sauce. Good stuff. Nice staff and lively. They are happy serving customers. Definitely coming back to try more ramen!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I was never a big ramen person, every time I've had it I felt so-so. I mostly only eat vegetarian options , so I assumed that was why. The Spicy Vegetarian Tantan at Misoya has become my new addiction.I have been over 8 times in the last month and a half. Even the tofu (which I don't usually like ) is so good! It's not too pricey and its insanely delicious. You can also get a points card from them where after 5 meals you get a free drink and after 10 meals you get a free meal! Great staff too! Simply Delicious."}
{"text":"My family visited Montreal over Spring Break from sunny Hawaii and got our share of 20-degree weather and snow flurries. Craving something hot and savory on a particularly chilly day, we stopped by Miso-Ya per my niece's recommendation. Between the five of us, we found something for everyone and tried four different broth types - shiro (mild, sweet), mame (thick, rich flavor), kome (smooth, savory), and curry. I ordered mame but had a taste of the others. Each is very different; it depends on what you like. For those who like heavier broths like paitan or tonkotsu, you'll enjoy the mame. Kids may enjoy the lighter shiro or kome broth better. They also serve tan-tan for sesame fans.  The noodles...yum! I like them cooked al dente which is how it will be served. If you like a softer texture, you may want to ask for it that way. Pile some of these long strands of deliciousness into your soup spoon with a little broth and slurp away! Curly and slightly chewy, they paired especially well with my thicker (mame) broth.   Get a plate of gyoza (5 pieces) - you won't be disappointed. Also, if your bowl doesn't come with a miso egg, order it as a side. So delicious! My boys and I aren't fans of char-siu pork so my lucky husband got 6 extra slices in his bowl.  The service and atmosphere was like you'd expect from a ramen-ya. Pleasantly no-frills, like going to a friend's house to eat. Our server was polite and efficient; I got to trade some Japanese phrases with her which added to the authenticity of the experience. Servers are Japanese, cooks are not - you can see into the kitchen from your table - but seem well trained in the preparation and plating of ramen and side dishes.   We went off peak (like 1:30pm) so we were able to get a table right away. If not, there's no place to stand and wait comfortably so that may have made us go elsewhere. I'm glad we didn't have to!  So, with two gyoza orders, a bowl of ramen each, and a couple orders of miso eggs, we all left very satisfied and charged up to head back out into the snow! Our bill came out to about $15 per person - not bad at all. We stayed full well until dinner time despite quite a bit of walking around the great city of Montreal.  Hawaii has no shortage of awesome ramen shops and I've been to my share in Japan as well. Miso-ya's service, selection and taste is on par with the best of them. It's easy to miss if you don't look hard! Use the Burritoville, it's upstairs neighbor, as a landmark and look for the red awning leading to the lower level. You be happy you tried it!"}
{"text":"Good food, but expensive for the price.   The service was mediocre, as they charged me a price that was different from what's stated on the menu.  One of those places where the food is so rich that you only go once every four months"}
{"text":"I visited Misoya ramen yesterday. Me and my boyfriend had been craving the saltiness of ramen for a few days and since it wasn't my first rodeo I absolutely wanted to take him there. I picked the Curry chicken ramen. Everything you've ever dreamed about a kick of curry in your ramen. The fried curry chicken goodness was the \"cherry on top\" they serve the dish long with sweet corn , beef and bean sprout. The ramen is firm - overloaded and the aroma of curry carried over in the noodles. Topped with a few slices of delicious fries. It won my heart :) if this place could lose points with me, it would probably be that not all dishes include misoya eggs... this one didn't. Who'd want to eat ramen without their egg.. ? come on :0"}
{"text":"The tasty is very salted, it is not suit me. A little disappoint.  Will try some different next time"}
{"text":"Sérieusement, dans ma vie j'ai eu la chance de manger beaucoup de choses de différentes culture, mais le ramen miso est le meilleur plat que j'ai jamais manger."}
{"text":"Although overall this place may not be that great in terms of atmosphere and even food, I have to say on a cold night after studying at the Concordia library, a good bowl of tantan spicy ramen is the best thing. I always get the tantan because the other soups are meh but this one is delicious and just spicy enough and I usually get it with fried chicken instead of pork cause the pork is way too fatty for my liking. Service is friendly and prices are reasonable. Although there might be better ramen spots in Montreal, most of them don't have tantan and that's the best one so I will always come back here!!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a ramen-fix place in Montreal and I may just have found one! Ramen Misoya broth are tasty, more on the salty side. The BBQ pork are thicker than Ramen-Ya with a lot more fat which means more flavor and so much goodness! I'm not too sure on the choice of vegetables though, which included fried potato and corn. But overall, strongly recommended to ramen-fans or tiny group of friends looking for small place to eat quickly."}
{"text":"The Tantan Ramen is spicy as hell and I love it. I always add an egg and corn, and you feel super full. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because sometimes I have to ask for water or napkins.  Also, it would be nice if there was a better deal with the add-ons because if you add nothing, it's a very basic meal, but if you add more stuff to make it less basic, you can end up spending $20 bucks on a bowl of soup."}
{"text":"Excellent ramen place! Gyoza came nice and hot with excellent flavours. Ramen itself was tasty with good portion sizes. The noodels were excellent and the soup was not too salty at all. Also had some fried chicken on the side and that was cooked to perfection! Service was excellent - with staff checking in regularly.  Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Mushroom ramen is he best in Montreal! A lot of spices which gives special flavourful taste."}
{"text":"A new staple in the Concordia ghetto for me. Solid Ramen, tasty broth and lots of options. Overall quite good, but I have a sweet spot for Ramen-Ya on the Plateau."}
{"text":"Stooped in here for lunch with a friend and the ramen very nice.   When we went in they gave us a menu with two different broth choices, and a list of add ins (extra $). We both choose a basic soup, no extras, and they were tasty! The ramen could have used a few more extras, like other places do standard, but for a quick and reasonably priced lunch, I'm not complaining.     We also enjoyed the fact that the restaurant wasn't busy, and we could sit and chat without feeling rushed. Not sure if that is still the case now that school has started."}
{"text":"I'm here usually at least once a week, between classes. It never gets too loud, the service is always great, and it's the closest I've had to authentic ramen since I was in Tokyo.  The broths are rich without being overpowering (my favourite is the komemiso), the chashu (pork) is always tender and juicy, and the noodles are perfectly cooked. Not exactly al dente, but not mushy - just the perfect texture, with a bit of chewiness. A perfect meal and atmosphere for a cold day.  For $10 most people will be pretty full, although I did find their drinks to be a little overpriced: $3 for a bottle of Oi Ocha (cold green tea) is a tad steep, but on the plus side it's the real deal.  As far as I can tell the entire staff is Japanese, and they keep it authentic by greeting every new patron/group with \"irashaimase!\" and bidding them adieu with \"arigatou gozaimasu!\" Love it."}
{"text":"Good ramen with varieties of dishes. Abundant cha shu and noodles but not expensive. We ordered golden, silver cha shu noodles and karaage. We can barely finish everything."}
{"text":"I tried their standard pork chashu ramen and I have definitely experienced better. Their broth was really salty and they offered these \"fried potatoes\" that were basically oil covered potato wedges that had no taste to them at all. This place is good for a quick ramen fix but I would stray away and go to a different ramen place if you wanted to impress someone who was craving ramen. They do have a ramen rewards system. Buy 8 ramens and you get 1 free!!"}
{"text":"They have a lot of options in terms of flavors for ramen, which at many places isn't likely, this was a definite plus.  I ordered the \"Miso Tonkotsu Spicy\" this ramen was SO spicy. I drank 4 cups of water back to back on top of taking my boyfriends water out of his hands just to chug it. When I tell you this was spicy, I ain't exaggerating. I love spicy, but my mistake was that I left all of the \"hot\" on the bottom, which I didn't mix around. So yes, as you can probably imagine, I died nearly towards the end and that was when I had no choice but to drink an excessive amount of water. Is it strange that even though this was happening I kept eating it? As if weirdly enough, I still loved it, including the broth. Does anyone else do this who loves spicy food or is it just me? Probably just me.   The service wasn't too welcoming. The place is tiny and there isn't much space to wait in, except for 2 or three steps where you're pretty much just standing in until there's a table cleared. No one came to us when the tables were clear either, no hostess, we just went and seated ourselves.   I wouldn't come here expecting to eat the best ramen there ever was, but it gets the job done if you're craving it. I will leave you with this, I am not quite sure what they use to make the ramen as far as ingredients. I mean, I enjoyed mine despite me leaving with heartburn. But, my boyfriend on the other hand, did not order spicy flavored ramen and he had a VERY upset stomach afterwards.   My tip: proceed with caution."}
{"text":"I tried their vegetarian ramen and it is very tasty. The service is friendly too."}
{"text":"J'ai découvert ce petit endroit tout mini et super cool proche de Concordia il y a quelques années. J'adore m'y arrêter pour déguster un bol de ramen et quelques gyozas. Il faut être patient car à l'heure du lunch tout le monde se bouscule devant se petit resto en demi sous-sol, et il se peut qu'il y ait un peu d'attentes. Essayez-le!"}
{"text":"I've been to Ramen Misoya twice now and both times I've been more or less disappointed by my experience.   Both times I ordered the same thing (shiro miso ramen which is a vegetarian ramen). The first time there were little bits of meat in my soup (I believe that defeats the purpose of the dish being \"vegetarian\") and the second time the soup was crazy salty.   You know what?-- no one is perfect in life, not even restaurants, but with that thought I don't think I am going to bother going back to this place. I have high standards even if that means perfect ramens.   (Let's get serious here, I don't know shit about perfect ramens but what I do know is that I don't like meat nor excess salt mixed in my soup when I order the vegetarian option. The end)."}
{"text":"It's all a blur. I was hungry, cranky, and at a loss for lunch plans so after minutes of aimless wandering I found this intriguing Ramen restaurant just east of Concordia's Borg Cube.  I'm not usually a fan of eating in basements but the layout here made it feel cozy and that you could sit at the bar and peek at the kitchen goings-on through stacks of gorgeous pottery put my reticence on the back burner.  Service was swift and uncomplicated. I started with the Daikon salad, a crisp, refreshing little mound of happiness. This was followed by a large bowl of Ramen Soup, bedecked with Miso flavoured egg (extra) a thick slice of delicious pork belly - perfectly grilled and a concatenation of toothsome noodles and, I believe, sprouts. Toss a couple of fried tofu on top of that and you've got a soup worth writing home about!  While you're writing home, you might want to ask Mom to send a couple of bucks your way because although entirely worth the price it's still a little spendy. Lunch, including a 200 ml bottle of Ramune Drink (think cream-soda minus the diabetic shock) that counterbalanced the inherent saltiness of the meal set me back seventeen dollars plus tip. I was no longer hungry or cranky as I headed back to the office so my choice to lunch there was a complete success."}
{"text":"De bons ramens réconfortants pour les soirs froids de l'hiver québécois. Ils sont très goûteux, mais aussi bien gras. Le service est un peu lent par moment, mais c'est une belle place pour aller souper avec un ami de longue date et passer un bon souper rapide.  Ambiance : Ce n'est pas du tout romantique. Ça ressemble plus à une ambiance de cafétéria qu'autre chose.  Nourriture : on a essayé également des dumplings. Ils étaient bons, mais sans plus.  Pour mes amis qui viennent de l'extérieur de Montreal, c'est une belle place à découvrir."}
{"text":"This is actually one of the spots I enjoy the most for ramen. Their noodles tend to be slightly firm yet chewy, which I really like; the pork has always been cooked perfectly; in general, the soup is really flavorful and good. What irks me though is the broth. For me it's way too salty and rich, which sort of brings the whole thing down a notch. That still doesn't stop me from going back, though, and if you're a big fan of savory foods then it's definitely worth a taste."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious. The curry ramen special was really good. Think Japanese curry mixed with ramen.   The mame miso ramen is also amazing. Service is so-so but the food 100% makes up for it."}
{"text":"It's cheap, it's delicious, it's chill and there's a lot of options. My favorite ramen place in Montreal by far."}
{"text":"Pour ma part, meilleur ramen vegetarien de Montreal. Si vous aimez le piment, demandez un supplement miso épice, c'est encore meilleur :)"}
{"text":"The saltiest ramen and broth I have ever had, and hopefully ever will have. And there was nothing to redeem it from this. The noodles were average. The pork belly was below average. This place isn't even particularly cheap. You can definitely do better for ramen elsewhere."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick lunch on a cold Saturday.  Had one of the two lunch special ramen & salad combos, and a side of gyoza.  The Gyoza were top drawer.  Very thin-skinned, stuffed to bursting, beautifully fried and plated, on the salty side, but utterly delicious.  Daikon salad was nice and crunchy, with an interesting, miso-sesame (It think) dressing.  The ramen was well-made, too, with perfect, chewy noodles, but it happened to be in a broth I don't care for, and accompanied by a few toppings I couldn't get my head around.  (Corn?  Fried potato wedges?)  Had I known they had a full menu instead of the abbreviated lunch card I was handed, though, I'm sure I would have gotten a bowl I actually liked, instead of one I merely ingested.  The cooks' dedication to their craft was evident .  Must also point out that the place is completely free of ambience- imagine a slightly-antiseptic Rue St-Laurent pho joint.  Background music was an early 70s Yes album, more appropriate to a hemp café.  And be forewarned, people seemed to find it a good place to bring their screaming babies. Not a date place, by any stretch.  As it stands, though, they get top marks for service and presentation, and for their stunning gyoza.  Doesn't really matter what color the walls are or what's on the stereo when I'm eating dumplings that good.  I'll probably be back for a double (or triple) order of those, and for a close look at the full menu."}
{"text":"Misoya is a simple little basement eatery owned and managed by a Japanese family, and they serve the best bowl of ramen you're going to get in Montreal. That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"Delicious vegetarian ramen. You can make it vegan by replacing the noodles with rice (or so has the legend)"}
{"text":"Rien de plus réconfortant qu'un bon bol de ramen lorsque le printemps se fait attendre, que le temps est pluvieux et frisquet"}
{"text":"Misoya is located in a small space, down a few steps on Bishop. I ordered the Chicken Katsu Curry Ramen. There were 3 generous sized pieces of chicken and assorted vegetables. The broth was very flavorful and rich. The ramen noodle portion is huge, so there is plenty of lelfoevers for the next day lunch!"}
{"text":"Misoya for sure is among my top 3 ramen place in Montreal. If only it has a better location. Upon entering the restaurant, I feel like I'm crawling into a beer's cave, and once you are in the restaurant you are indeed in a bear cave. Obviously I've exaggerated a little bit. However, the ramen makes you forget any discomfort about the place. It's well presented, most importantly the broth is strong. Personally, I like it when the soup is dense and strong because it mix well with the noodle. It's the perfect place for a quick stop when you are craving ramen.   The price is pretty standard for a bowl of ramen. They also offer fried shrimp tempura, fried chicken (kara-age), takoyaki, gyoza just to name a few. I had the change to order the kara-age and it was perfectly fried. \  Overall great food and great service. I'm sure I would visit this place much more often if they had a better location."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, I wish I could give fractions on yelp.  I love ramen and I was glad we found a good place for ramen in Montreal.  The noodles were good and the broth was very rich in flavor.  Maybe a little too rich?  I typically end up eating all the broth in my ramen.  Here... maybe it was a little salty?  I didn't didn't finish it.  The pork was good, meaty & fatty and it's on the thicker side of what i'm normally used to.  All the local ramen places serve very thin slices of pork.  I gotta say... I think the thinner more delicate slices of pork go better with ramen."}
{"text":"Great experience that start by being welcome in Japanese as soon as you pass the door. The ramen is simply amazing. The choice of ingredients is good but what really makes them stand our is the taste of their broth: simply put the best I've ever had. They also have traditional entrées like takoyaki ( really good. A must try). Will go back again and again."}
{"text":"Extremely lame! Wanted to give these guys a try for a while, but when I went a few days ago to do a quick takeout, the girl who greeted me sheepishly said they don't do takeout anymore because they don't have any containers. Really???? How about you buy some then??? With the large scale construction going on next door and lack of parking, and no takeout, this place is only good for those who want to eat in and are on foot. I'm sure my business is not needed considering they are across from Concordia, but I'm sticking to Imadake for a quick ramen takeaway!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite ramen spot in downtown. Is it salty? Yea its a bit too salty but I think im just used to it since I eat so much instant ramen. Im not a fan of creamy rich ramen like Kinton offers. I always take the komemiso special. My favorite part about this place is that the ramen comes with alot of toppings without you having to pay extra. Its by far the best bang for your buck ramen in downtown."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Ramen Misoya and I was a little bit disappointed. I ordered the special Miso Yum ramen from the summer menu. It had one big sliced pork, half of an boiled egg and 1 shrimp. My friend ordered the special Tantan ramen which is a creamy thick spicy pork broth with two big slice of pork, an boiled egg sliced in two and some sheets of seaweed. Personally, my ramen was a little too salty for my taste, so I didn't liked it that much and couldn't finish my plate. My friend's ramen was great, although it was a tad bit salty. (It was less salty than mine though). When asked about our experience at the cashier, we told the server that we found our ramen a little bit saltier and he told us that all their ramen are salty but we could ask to add extra broth to reduce the saltiness. I will take this into consideration at my next visit. He also offered a points card, so if you're a regular client, or you're planning on becoming one, you should definitely get it!"}
{"text":"This place, though they charge extra for egg and other ingredients, I find has the most decent ramen in town. I've tried so far 2 types of ramen, both which are tasty tasty! I tried to the spicy strong miso  based broth ramen, and the 3 pc pork belly strong miso based broth. Let me tell you, that pork belly is really addictive and by the far the highlight of the whole ramen.  I wish they gave more than 3 pcs, I could honestly have a couple more. It also came with potato wedges, geez those were really good too.   Service is generally attentive, especially with the water refills. They are quite on top of that. Food comes to you fairly quickly....but downside? Price. I find it is in fact slightly overpriced for ramen.  Each bowl is on average 13-14 bucks. And you know plus tax and all, can be up to 18 bucks. I don;'t know about that....but it's just too tasty for me to care really.   Check out this place if you're in the mood for some hearty ramen."}
{"text":"Holy sh!t the broth is salty. I feel sick. And very expensive. Family of four, no one was impressed. And two of us left with sore stomachs. Try another option."}
{"text":"J'y suis allée qu'une fois il y a un bon moment mais c'était super appétissant juste à la vu du bol de ramen et un coup après la première bouchée, j'étais conquise. Je me dois de retourner bientôt!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  I'm new to the Ramen world. I've been buying the 0.40$ ones forever and never really understood why I should pay more.  My friends are big ramen fans though so now I'm exploring!  This place is great for Concordia students even if they don't have a student discount.  I got the special komemiso ramen which came with the meat and the egg. It was pretty good! A bit too salty but still tasty. The meat was a bit too much fat for my liking.  Portions are huge but I think that goes for every ramen place.   They have a punch card system. After 5 you get a free drink and at your 10th you get it free.  The service is a bit slow but they're very nice and quick to clean up."}
{"text":"I had the tonkotsu. Noodles we good. The broth so so, kinda plain but I like mine salty. Had fried rice which was good. The kaarage was good I really liked the mayo sauce that came with it. The place was packed so I'm sure the locals like it which says a lot as well"}
{"text":"I just posted a review two days ago about Kinto Ramen being the best ramen I have tried in Montreal, but thats because I haven't tried Misoya ramen yet. Misoya is hands down my favorite ramen place (as for now).   The prices are fair, not too expensive, and their menu is more extensive compared to Kinto. They also have more choices for their toppings such as fried tofu and potato. I ordered their lunch special goma-tan ramen with fried tofu and potato as extra topping.  - goma-tan: There was a lot of ma-yu on the top on the broth at first so it tasted too strong for the first few sips, but once you mixed it up the broth taste perfect. The broth is rich but not greasy and you can taste the sesame and ma-yu. It is not spicy at all, I enjoyed just having the broth on its own. Unlike other reviews, I didn't find the broth too salty, it was just perfect for me. No regret in ordering the potato as extras, they went super well with the broth. They were soft in the inside and since they were soaked in the broth, they were extra flavorful. The noodles are similar to those offered at kinto ramen, perfecly cooked, chewy.   Gonna come back for sure?"}
{"text":"I'm going to make this short and straightforward. I got the Spicy Tantan ramen and it was okay. Noodles are slightly undercooked and the broth is too heavy for my liking. The flavour of the broth was not as flavourful or spicy enough for it to be called spicy ramen.   Overall, I've had a lot better and unfortunately I will not be back."}
{"text":"The ramen that I had gotten was beyond disgusting. The broth was nauseating. If you do not eat pork, please save yourself money and time by going somewhere else. I got the vegetarian ramen with mushrooms, fries and chicken, for a total(with tx) of 15.50$. Horrible food."}
{"text":"Best ramen in montreal. Service & Menu has improved recently.   The noodles are unbeatable, the broth is so tasty !"}
{"text":"The Ramen broth is a bit too salty and not very palatable after a few spoonfuls. The noodles are of the right texture. I would add the karaage (fried chicken), spicy miso broth and egg topping to any of their ramen dishes for a very complete bowl of ramen. The spicy miso broth is incredibly spicy but it masks the salty, otherwise very miso-y broth that comes with all the ramens. Skip the fried tofu topping - they only lightly fry the tofu and it stays soft inside. The fries topping is good.   I had the vegetable ramen (because I don't eat pork and the other ramen specifically mentioned a pork broth). My friend had the Tan-Tan Ramen which was very spicy but delicious and another had the Chicken Ramen - the chicken pieces were delicious! My husband and I weren't big fans of the two vegetable Ramen dishes that we got mostly because the broth wasn't great and the components in the ramen were very boring and bland. No real flavor or imagination there."}
{"text":"In overall, I think it's a great place for ramen in downtown area. Broth is a bit too salty (just add water, not much of a big deal), but still well flavoured. The other ingredients such as ramen and vegetables are good. Same for appetizer (Gyoza)!  Service is quick enough. Staff are nice. They have that \"have x number of ramen and get y for free\". I think that's a good little bonus.   Price goes around 10$ for the main dish."}
{"text":"I loved this place when it first opened and while I still go there from time to time, I feel like there is room for improvement. The ramen itself is tasty. I love the taste and texture of the noodles and don't mind the saltiness of the broth. It's salty, bold and flavourful. The pork was tender and fatty. Now for the downsides: the miso egg I got with my soup was hard boiled and still cold. The potato wedges were undercooked and tasted more baked than fried. The bamboo wedges were still a little cold as well. These weren't issues the first few times I went there. The restaurant itself is small and the ventilation isn't great. There is a lot of smoke from the kitchen seeping into the dining room which leaves you and your clothes with an unpleasant smell. Also the restaurant itself seems unkept. The walls need some plastering and the floor has gotten very damaged over time. This place still fills my ramen craving but I have to admit that my last experience there has slightly turned me off."}
{"text":"Since when did mane have bean sprout in them? This place used to be the best place in town for ramen (a year ago) but now with all the new openings, mislay is losing its charm. The broth, during both my visit, was too salty to my liking (I've tried the tonkotsu and the curry) but the noodles were nice and chewy.   However, we did see Antonio Park eating here during one of our visits so it mustn't be that bad if the famous chef from Park restaurant eats here.   Overall, its cheap and tastes not bad but not somewhere you go out of your way to try."}
{"text":"So good! Best ramen I've had in a while. I had the spicy Tantan ramen with eggs. There are plenty of different toppings to choose from. The ramen was delicious and not too salty. Visiting Montreal for the first time and it has definitely been one of the best meals so far."}
{"text":"This ramen chain with other locations in Tokyo and New York dishes up some tasty noodles and broth. The menu is a bit complex with three types of broth and several topping options as well as a few specials. The broths are excellent and packed with subtle and complex flavors. The pork belly was more solid than most I've had in ramen, and almost more of a bacon, which was a nice change. It made it a bit harder to break up, but added a lot more flavor. The noodles were ample, and unlike other ramen joints that push you to get a second helping of them, there are more than enough to make it through the meal. The broth was nice and spicy, perfect on a sub arctic winter day, but not overly so. The special curry ramen was also very interesting with a delicious curry broth and chicken pieces, but a bit heavy to finish. They also like putting pieces of potato into the ramen which is different, but works pretty well. The dim sum were a great starter and packed with flavor. Sadly they don't have beer as an Asahi or Ichiban would go great with the ramen. Service was good, though not overly attentive, but super fast. The basement location doesn't have a lot in the way of ambiance, but works for the food."}
{"text":"Okay tier ramen shop located a couple steps from the museum of fine arts. Prices are what you expect from a ramen shop, food was nothing special. If I were in Montreal, and I were looking for a quick bite to eat, I'd recommend the place."}
{"text":"Great ramen place. Everything tasted good. The only thing that was not so perfect was the soup -- a bit too salty."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this ramen place for a while now from my friends so I thought I'd try it out. Seeing a line at the door seemed like a good sign, must be good ramen! A little disappointed is how I would describe my ramen experience. I've definitely had better ramen elsewhere.   To begin, ordering was simple, menu was easy to go through and service was quick.   I ordered the shiromiso cha-shu ramen, when it arrived it looked good, well presented, but at closer look, the cha-shu was like 70% fat. Trust me, I appreciate a bit of fat on my cha-shu, but when you take a bite of it and its nothing but fat, its not exactly appetizing. The flavor of the pork is fine, but the amount of fat... I left about half of the cha-shu there and it was all fat.   Next, the noodles, they were probably the better part of the ramen, good texture, firm, tender. It was however, masked by a overwhelming amount of bean sprouts.   Finally the broth... Shiromiso is supposed to be milder and sweeter... Unfortunately it was much too salty and I could barely taste the natural sweet and creamy flavors of the broth itself. I did hear another customer telling the waiter about the saltiness, from what I understood he suggested to dilute the broth with ??water (I might have heard wrong) but the fact that we'd have to dilute the broth ourselves is a bit of a problem.   Taking into consideration the fact that getting a decent bowl of ramen isn't easy in Montreal, I still think they have room to improve."}
{"text":"i'm not sure how this place doesn't have 5 stars. it has the best ramen i've ever eaten in my life."}
{"text":"The broth was more salty than typical ramen, making it unpleasant to eat, we had to dilute it with water. And the cold water they gave us had a strong smell and taste of detergent."}
{"text":"Having been a server for over 6 yrs during school.  Excellent soups explosion of flavour in your mouth comforting, overly salty, fatty, and burn your delicious. chewy noodles, Fat as fuck pieces of pork. (in the good bacon way)   Absolutely ruined by horribly arrogant, non-helpful, lost, and inattentively slow service. the rest is a TIP i'm leaving to the owners and server who hopefully give a shit about what clients think, and about making their restaurant better.  gave the place 3 tries.  Lunch time in downtown Montreal means clients should be in and out within less than 50 mins for business people. Students have time, Businessmen, not as much. Students wear Concordia sweaters, business people, shirts and ties...  First time, waitress was helpful and nice, explained all soups , didn't even ask! . no complaints as she felt bad when the kitchen was being slow. Understandable, out of her reach. remind you, I worked in many restaurants from in and out volume-heavy breakfast places to fine dining sommelier  steakhouses.  Second time, server didn't speak proper french or english, not because of accent or anything out of his control, but because he'd talk in his chin and shy away with a condescending look when we asked for more information on 3 different broths; answers were basically : this one ...this one.... no proper explanation like I recieved the first time I came, I felt let down, as I had dragged hesitant my colleagues to this place venting the best fucking soup they'd have in awhile.  we had about an hour lunch break. mentionned it to teh server and instead of acknowledging our request , he told us no, i cant do that. you can't skip the line.  I understand there are other people in the restaurant, but goddamnit, as a waiter, customer is ALWAYS right or at least make him feel like he is... I'm not being an asshole, I know what i'm talking about.  Decided to give it a 3rd try by myself trying hard to convince myself this place was not either run by morons or just outright pathetic.  To my great despair, Disastrous service, slow and I honestly tried to make the server cheer up, and be slightly enthusiastic about his (what seemed to be) miserable life;  I WAS THE ONE SMILING AT HIM.   The service you offer is the image of your restaurant. sloppy service reflects sloppy standards and this will attract sloppy people.  Not my bowl of soup... even it it's the tastiest one in Montreal."}
{"text":"Honestly, just an ok place for day that you don't feel like cooking. Or maybe I have high standards compare to what I had in Vancouver. Their thick soup was what I had and it wasn't thick as far as I could tell. Worth checking out once to have a base for comparison other places."}
{"text":"Excellent ramen, I would say it's better than many of the places in China town. The place is reasonably priced and they give you a wide selection of options to add to each ramen dish. The Chicken karaage was excellent however I wouldn't recommend the gyoza (it was small and only average)."}
{"text":"Je suis une grande adepte de ramen et après avoir essayé celle de plusieurs restaurants Montréalais, je déclare que c'est mon resto de ramen miso préféré. Meilleure que celle du Kinton, du Yokato, du Hakata, Sumo et bien d'autres. C'est plutôt authentique, alors attendez vous à ce que ce soit un peu salé et gras.  Cet endroit est petit, donc il se remplit rapidement sur l'heure du lunch et du soûper. Peu importe quand vous venez, ça vaut la peine. Le service n'est pas terrible, mais la nourriture le pardonne!"}
{"text":"People go to Misoya Ramen for one reason: The food. Unlike other ramen restaurants, what sells me on this place is the quality and authenticity. You won't find a fancy decor, but you can count on tasty food though! I always get the gyoza and japanese fried chicken, they are simply delicious. As for the ramen, the noodles, creamy broth and confort level is on point. Last time i went, i tried the tan tan spicy ramen and it was fantastic! Definitely recommend if you're looking for a damn good meal"}
{"text":"Food: I ordered the Kome miso ramen and added an egg. I also had their gyoza. The meal came with a daikon salad. The daikon salad was a nice appetizer and the gyoza was also pretty good. Now for the ramen. It was a pretty decent bowl. The broth wasn't overpowering or too greasy. The flavor was good. The chashu was also not bad, probably the best part of the bowl. The noodles were also not bad. So bottom line, everything about their ramen was not bad. But it wasn't spectacular. Nothing to write home about, but if you need a hot bowl of ramen and you're nearby... why not? You're going to get a decent bowl of ramen here.  Service: The service was friendly and great. No problems here. But keep in mind that I came here right when they opened so there wasn't anybody else eating there yet. A couple groups showed up during my meal, but it was never got too busy.  Location: Pretty conveniently located near subway and bus stops. I didn't have a car for the weekend, but it was just an easy short walk to the restaurant. If you have a car, you'll probably need to find street parking. The restaurant is located in the basement of the building."}
{"text":"Way too salty! It was too salty to point that you could barely eat it. The meat slice was good though but the overly salty soup base defeated everything.  I might go back just to give it another shot. Maybe..."}
{"text":"Enter the restaurant : lack of welcoming to restaurant. Service : only one time serve water even if it was not busy. Food : i ordered karage and miso gold ramen. Too salty, and noodle did not cook well. Most important, pork in the soup , was not cooked enough, it was hard to bite and was not soft enough to chewing. I hope they have accept this comments.   It needs to improve , more compare other restaurants in montreal or toronto.  Thank you"}
{"text":"This review might be a bit biased since I'm not the biggest fan of japanese ramen, but I was really not impressed with this joint. First of all, my boyfriend and I weren't even acknowledged for the first 3 long minutes we were standing in the entrance. It seemed like the staff just avoided eye contact cause they were busy. Secondly they were playing this awful heavy metal--not what you expect from a japanese restaurant, nor what you'd want in the background on a date. The ramen took about 20 minutes to arrive and we had plans to go see a movie. So when the food finally came we were in a bit of rush. And the food was very lackluster.. super salty. I had the basic which was not very good. My boyfriend had the miso ramen which tasted slightly better. All in all, I would not return."}
{"text":"3 stars for me.   Came here yesterday for lunch based on a recommendation. I have to agree that I enjoyed the \"not so busy\" atmosphere.  We didn't feel rushed and yhe service was good.  My cousin ordered a soup and the chicken kaarage, which came as an order of 6 large pieces. The strange part was it came out after our soups. I wish I could have tried it first. It was delicious! They use the dark meat of the chicken so it was nice and juicy.  The batter was so crispy and yet not greasy. This was the highlight of our meal for me.  I forgot which miso ramen I ordered, but it came with a piece of fried tofu, 3 slices of cha shu and the usual fixings. I am not a fan of salty food and was told by the server that it was the least salty of the 3 miso choices. I was expecting it to be less salty than what I've had at other restaurants, but I was wrong. It was way too salty for me. Probably the saltiest soup I have ever had. So I just skipped sipping the broth. A lot of reviewers mentioned they liked the cha shu. I guess I will be the odd one to say that I did not. I like my pork not overly fatty, but tender and I found the meat too tough. The noodles were ok. They were more on the hard side rather than silky and chewy. I like mine like the latter.  Overall, I have had better ramen at other places.I wouldn't mind coming back if I'm with others who'd like to try it out, but would probably go elsewhere if I was the one suggesting. And if I come back, I might stick to ordering their appies."}
{"text":"Fantastic little resto. This place as become my boyfriend and Is go to for ramen near his place. Great variety, great quick service at really reasonable pricing. Definitely recommend if you're in the area and looking for a warm bite to fill your stomach and satisfy a noodle craving."}
{"text":"I really like this place because the ramen is always huge and satisfying. It is pricey for a regular ramen ($15-$20), but you're getting a big portion. It's in a convenient part of town and my friends and I always get the ramen to go and go sit at the parks by Peel, or if we're studying at the Concordia library.  The only downside for me was that the majority of their ramen is in a pork-based broth as opposed to miso or chicken, and I don't eat pork products, so I was limited to the vegetarian option. Another thing is that the restaurant decor isn't exactly great or new, so keep that in mind if you're thinking of bringing people here for some kind of MTL-Asian fusion experience. There's kinto ramen down the street that looks a little more upscale."}
{"text":"I needed comfort food after a 6 hours long flight and decided to try Ramen Misoya as it is close from where I live. I ordered the Shiro Miso Vegetarian Ramen to go and didn't wait too much, the staff was very friendly and even offered me a glass of water while I was waiting. I have not much to say about the quality of the service and the food, everything was perfect from start to finish.  But, because there is a but, I opted for this restaurant because they offered a vegetarian (vegan friendly, according to the ingredients) alternative to my beloved ramen and I found pieces of meat in the stew. I understand that it is because they use the same stew for meaty and vegetarian ramen, and only use a strainer for the second one but they should mention it as it was a very unpleasant surprise and the fact that meat is used in the process can go against some vegans and vegetarians' beliefs, even if meat is not (supposed to be) present in the end product. This is a bit sad because I really love their ramen and I would probably come often if this was not an issue.  I can understand that ramen are usually and traditionally made with meat, and that therefore vegetarian ramen are not the norm, but it would be greatly appreciated if they could cook them separately.   Conclusion: If you're a meat lover, don't hesitate, I don't think you can be disappointed even though I haven't tried the other ones. If you're vegetarian or vegan, you might want to think about it twice as meat is most likely present in some part of the process. Other than that, it's pretty affordable, you'll leave full and it's not too noisy either. I'm giving four stars because it has everything you can expect from a ramen restaurant."}
{"text":"not the most authentic ramen in montreal, but it is really close! the broth is very flavourful and portions are bigger than most ramen places here. they also have other side dishes available to order such as tofu and takoyaki. its located downtown montreal. they have a variety of different ramens to chose from including tokotsu and also exotic ones like curry ramen."}
{"text":"Took the miso ramen and it was delicious, except that it was a little bit too salty... But it was still good, and the price wasn't too expensive!"}
{"text":"The ramen at this place hits the spot. We stumbled upon this place looking for something to eat at around 3 pm on a Saturday. I was surprised that the place was still fairly busy during off hours. I ordered the cha-Su ramen. It was one of the best Japanese ramen noodles I have ever tasted in my life.   The broth was rich and flavorful. The noodles were chewy (just the way I like my noodles), and not too soggy. The pork was cooked to perfection. They were nice and thick. There were also two potato wedges, which was an interesting touch, but it was great!  Overall this little ramen place is amazing. I did not expect to get such good ramen in Montreal. It blew my expectations out of the water. The ramen are legitimately comparable to the ramen bowls that I had in Japan."}
{"text":"this was the best ramen shops i've ever went to... the ramens are tasty really really delicious plus the gyoza are really good, you should go to this restaurant ;)"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall with quick service and authentic ramen... I had a great experience twice!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a difference a few months make! I decided to swing by Misoya recently, despite having been turned off by my last visit. Not sure if management changed, but I see many new improvements. For one, the waitstaff is much nicer! I haven't had the misfortune of seeing that red-headed waitress. Secondly, the quality of the ramen has improved. Thirdly, they spruced up the decor with some artwork. Will start going back regularly!"}
{"text":"I wanted to update on my review after re-visiting Misoya and redact my suspicions of the broth not being 100% vegetarian. I confirmed with the staff and they do use a different vegetarian broth. The ramen was just as fantastic and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The reasons why I am giving it one star are twofolds: - Horrible and slow service: waiters look a bit lost, they didn't come take our order until I asked. We ordered an appetizer and two bowls of ramen, and had to wait 45 min before we got our food - The gyoza: the meat tasted sour with an aftertaste, as if it was expired (maybe it was actually expired). I pretty much spit the gyoza out.  Now, the ramen and broth is actually pretty good and the portion of chashu (the meat) is quite generous.   But I wouldn't go back, as I got so frustrated by the waiting time, waiters didn't really apologize and when I said the meat in the gyoza was probably expired, they still charged us."}
{"text":"Delicious, affordable ramen near Concordia.   As many have mentioned, the restaurant itself is pretty plain and small, but if you're willing to sit at the bar it goes quite quickly.  Now for the food: we tried one gold and one silver, I took the special which has all the good stuff inside. Noodles are nice and bouncy, broth is rich and comforting, but not out of this world. Tofu, cha-shu and egg were perfectly cooked and mixed deliciously in the ramen. We also had the takoyaki which were good.  Overall I would certainly go back since I'm always in the area, but I will try different broths until I find the perfect one."}
{"text":"Ramen are too salty. And I ordered takoyaki,soaked by ramen broth and It wasn't supposed like that. Ayay! But they have a very nice ambience place."}
{"text":"Great ramen in Montreal. Flavourful broth and perfect noddle texture. Ordered Tantan ramen and Komemiso Cha-Su Ramen.   Tantan ramen is too heavy and thick, I would order Komemiso Cha-Su Ramen next time.   www.bornandbraised.ca"}
{"text":"??????????????????????  ????????????????????????  ?????????????????  ??????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Not the best ramen I had in Montreal. The chicken had a lot of fat and the broth caused me to tank easily 5 glasses of water. The place wasn't exactly sanitary. Floors were sticky and so were the tables. Evidentally, I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"The wait time is ridiculous but the taste and the soup made up everything!!! Must order the Fried chicken every time, the best fried chicken that I ever had."}
{"text":"Les meilleurs ramen de Montréal ! Très proche de ceux que j'ai pu gouter au Japon. Un peu cher mais tellement bon. Prévoir une bonne heure de digestion. :)"}
{"text":"I don't know much about authentic Japanese food, but this is my go to for ramen because I work in the area and it's almost become kind of a treat to myself. I get the cha-su ramen, because that pork is actually a party and I dream about it. The broth, noodles and veggies are good in my opinion, but if you are like an expert in this type of food or just very picky, take it with a grain of salt(y)."}
{"text":"When to this place few times with my girlfriend. She like a lot this ramen place. But specially me. I always like Japanese Ramen.   Their classic Miso Ramen is the best. When you add few extra topping. It become perfect bowl of ramen.   Reasonable price. Each extra topping cost only a dollar or two. But it can go up over 20$ ( Like I always do for extra ChaChu ).  Overall good place."}
{"text":"J'ai commandé le soupe ramen Shiromiso cha-shu. Le bouillion était délicieux (surtout avec l'ajout de Miso épicé), les nouilles etaient aussi super. Le porc était très gras (60% de gras facilement) mais au moins les trois morceaux étaient plutot gros. L'entrée de Gyoza était AMAZING. J'en aurais mangé 10 autres.   L'entrée n'était pas cher du tout, par contre, j'ai trouvé que les soupes avec les extras étaient un peu chers au final. Il faut être patient (particulièrement si vous y allez un vendredi/samedi soir) car il y aura assurément une file d'attente. Le restaurant est petit, il y a environ 12-13 tables seulement.   Overall je recommande l'endroit for sure!!"}
{"text":"For the longest time i was looking for a good good bowl of Ramen in this town, finally  have found it!   The Ramen was very good here, i would recommend it to anyone looking for a good one like i was.  I will be coming back"}
{"text":"I don't eat ramen very often, so I can't compare this place to others. Misoya is small and underground, but nonetheless when I came at 14h30 on a Saturday, all but one tables were filled.   I ordered the spicy Kyoto style ramen, and it was quite good. The broth was smooth with a bit of sweetness. There was a substantial dollop of spicy miso on top of the noodles, so you don't have to make the soup super spicy if you don't want to - just don't mix in all the miso.  I am taking a star off because it's hard to impossible to eat vegetarian here, and I don't think they're very flexible with their menu choices. I asked to substitute Naruto for cha-shu in a dish, and they said no. Apparently, Naruto is reserved for only one of their dishes."}
{"text":"Finally, I can stop thinking about moving to another city because we now have a genuinely good Japanese ramen in town!   I had the tonkotsu ramen and added 2 pieces of char-siu pork. I'll keep this succinct: The broth: savoury and slurp-worthy, but perhaps a bit too salty so I was unable to finish it. The noodles: perfectly al dente! The toppings: the marinated half-boiled egg tasted like paradise (wish they'd given me the other half though), the pork was tasty but not nearly as melt-in-your-mouth as it should be.   Overall, I was very satisfied, but there are a couple of things that stop me from giving them 5 stars. Number one, it took them half an hour to bring out our food. Number two, there was a clear lack of ventilation inside the restaurant, in a sense that I could see and smell smoke pervading the dining room. Don't let these two things stop you from trying them out though, especially since there's a lack of better ramen alternatives in Montreal."}
{"text":"La météo était automnale cette semaine, alors le goût m'est revenu de savourer ma tendre ramen préférée.   Cette fois-ci, le service a été remarquablement rapide (5 minutes pour recevoir notre bol) et particulièrement sympathique, autant de notre serveur assigné que de l'employé qui travaillait à la caisse.   Je ne vois jamais le fond de mon bol tellement il est généreux et je mange toujours un peu trop par gourmandise, mais je suis rentrée chez moi en Bixi ensuite, donc j'imagine que ça s'annule un peu ;)"}
{"text":"Misoya has gotten some rave reviews recently of the \"Finally!,\"  \"Montreal's best ramen!,\" and \"Japanese ramen chains do it better!\" variety.  And, don't get me wrong, I'm okay with the idea of ramen from a chain restaurant.  A couple of the very best ramens I ever had were courtesy of established Japanese ramen chains with global reach.  But this ain't one of them.  True ramen ought to be a work of art and it ought to drive you cra-zee. Here, the broth was uninspired, the pork belly was chewy and not at all buttery, the fixings were on the skimpy side (what? you have to pay extra for nori?), and the extra egg was nicely cooked but was oddly lacking in flavour.  Nothing we had was bad, but nothing was outstanding, either.  Too bad.  I could always use another ramen joint."}
{"text":"I ordered the takoyaki and the tonkotsu ramen. The takoyaki was very good and flavorful, while the ramen was perfect. The broth was seasoned well, the noodles were firm, and the portions are good. The only thing I wish was different was the amount of toppings. I wish we received a bit more with the dish, but if you want extra, they are available to order. I will definitely do that time. Overall, it was a delicious meal, and I will definitely go back next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"The ramen was good but way too salty. On the other hand, the chicken Kara-age was really good.  The staff was not friendly. Didn't talk at all besides taking the order."}
{"text":"Located on a lower level, this restaurant is a hidden gem. One of my favorite place to eat a ramen soup. The broth is amazing, not too salty and the combination of ingredients is just perfect.  Don't expect a fancy table or decoration. Great meal at a good price. Done!"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: Misoya is kind of a hole-in-the-wall restaurant. When you  first enter, it looks kind of run-down and plain.   FOOD: I find the food very good. Their karaage was delicious in my opinion. Their spicy ramens are very good as well. On the other hand, their miso ramens are definitely too salty. I had to add water to my broth. However, I was disappointed with their takoyaki. It was lying in a pool of runny sauce and wasn't the best I've had. Overall, I would say that there are better ramen spots in Montreal.  PRICE: Prices are decent, pretty much the same prices as any other ramen restaurant. They do have a loyalty card which is a nice touch.  SERVICE: The service is good. It's usually the owner of the restaurant who serves me and she is friendly."}
{"text":"My favourite ramen restaurant in Montreal so far. Many choices of toppings and broth. Cha-shu was nicely grilled and delicious. Noodles were not overcooked  (which happened at other places). Broth was a bit salty but was very good. Their gyoza were pretty good too.   I would definitely recommend this place to my friends if they want some good ramen."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and the ramen here is quite good.  The broth is very flavourful and they have a lot of toppings that can be added to your ramen. The portions are generous and the char siu is very tasty.  Their karaage is delicious and very crispy! Be careful not to burn your tongue because it is pipping hot by the time it makes it to your table. The one major downer is that it is often too salty."}
{"text":"The ramen here is ok. The noodles are quite bland along with the soup. I find the soup too salty but also tasteless. The meat though is plentiful! That's always nice.  Chicken karaage wasn't very good. They are small and hard, hardly any chicken.  Service is quick. Nice people and a clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellents ramens au bouillon riche et gouteux. J'ai un peu tout essayé, mais mon préféré est le Hokkaido. SI vous aimez le gras qui fond dans la bouche comme moi, vous serez servi. Les nouilles et les légumes sont très bons, même si je me passerais bien de la pomme frite que je trouve bizarre dans un ramen, mais c'est le seul bémol.   Lorsque l'on commande un ramen, il faut garder en tête que par définition on demande un plat gras et pas très bon pour les bourrelets mais qui tient au corps et qui est parfait pour l'hiver. Demander qu'un ramen soit \"sain\", c'est un peu demander qu'une poutine soit saine. C'est juste pas le concept.  Pour le reste, le karaage et les gyozas sont bons. Le service est sympa même s'il faut parfois attendre pas mal de temps pour être servi. J'y retourne régulièrement et ne m'en lasse pas."}
