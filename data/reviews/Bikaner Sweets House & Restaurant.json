{"text":"***** BEST INDIAN FOOD IN THE CITY!!!!! ******   A friend suggested this place to me a while ago, but I didn't check it out until about a couple months ago when I found myself in the NE part of Calgary.   Bikaner is the kind of place that you could drive by and never really pay attention to - it's quite unassuming from the exterior. But as soon as you step in, you're greeted by friendly servers (who might take a second glance and instantly acknowledge that you don't live in this part of town).    In a nutshell, Bikaner Sweets House is the best Indian I've had in Calgary. It is also ridiculously cheap, which doesn't hurt either ;) The interior is very spacious, with a full bar and open dancefloor (I think?) which is available for event bookings.   Safe to say my friends and I have become regulars here, for both the delicious buffet (at $9.99, you can't go wrong) and dinner service. We usually order the butter chicken and goat curry with basmati rice and garlic naan bread, all of which are cooked and spiced to perfection by the entertaining staff at Bikaner.  This is a hidden GEM in the city and you'll be coming back time and time again  - or in my case, three times in ten days :)"}
{"text":"My partner and I came in for the dinner buffet on a Sunday. No special weekend pricing unlike most Indian buffets - it seems to be $15 per person for dinner every day (surprisingly cheap for a non-vegetarian buffet). We loved everything! The butter paneer was probably our favourite, but the butter chicken was definitely up there. Though it wasn't very busy, fresh food was brought out more often than I've seen at any other buffet. The host(?) was pleasant and helped us to identify what everything was. We will definitely be back.  Edit: Came back on a Thursday night and had a slightly different experience. The food wasn't super fresh, but certainly still edible. The butter chicken was completely different than the one we had on a Sunday - it tasted (to me) like it was just cooked in a can of tomato soup. The paneer was still very good. The dessert (vermicelli kheer) tasted like plain milk with some noodles thrown in, and the jalebi was quite soggy. We were the only people there and noticed that they closed up right after we left (though it was just after 5:30 PM), so maybe they were just having an off day. The service was fine, and the man who was very helpful last time brought us fresh naan (which was unfortunately quite burnt, though we appreciated the gesture). The pakoras were still amazing - among the best I've had. I previously gave five stars, but I've revised my rating to 4 due to the apparent decrease in food quality on weekdays."}
{"text":"I came ALLLL the way from the SW up to Bikaner Sweets for a Sangeet (ladies party for Indian women getting married) I cant comment on the cost, and since it was crazy busy with ladies all over the place and it was buffet style, the service seemed as quick as it could be, trying to dodge all the women, while picking up plates and refilling waters. The food was amazing!!! Butter Chicken was to die for. Not too tomato-ey, The sauce is a little more thin than Im used to , but the taste more than made up for it.  From the naan to the pakora to the peas pulao..everything was perfectly cooked and moist.  I actually would travel the distance again to go back and try more of their food."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. I drive from the south just to come here to eat. The only thing i am not a fan of is that the service is not very good. They are very friendly but a little slow to take your order and to see how things are at the end of your meal. Another thing is it seems that their cooks change often and you get a different dish each time, It is still amazing but not consistent. I still love their food though"}
{"text":"I am definitely not a connoisseur of Indian sweets, but it doesn't take an expert to know that the sweet baked goods at Bikaner Sweets House and Restaurant are great!  The first time I drove by I was intrigued by the name; the next time I decided to stop in.  As you enter the restaurant you pass through the sweet shop, where amazing Indian treats are sold by weight.  I have no idea what I tried (one was a sweet, spongey, cake-like thing that was white on one end and light brown on the other; I also tried a more dense white square with pistachios on top) but they were incredible!  I've also brought out-of-town guests to Bikaner Sweets House and Restaurant to sample the treats and they agree with me- it's all absolutely delicious!  The staff there are always so nice to me and I never feel like they're judging me because I don't know the different sweets.    I will definitely return in the future to try the restaurant- if the food is half as good as their sweets it will be worth it!"}
{"text":"I visited Bikaner Sweets House and Restaurant today for the first time and I gotta say, I was very impressed! I tried their lunch buffet and it was good! The food was excellent, the space is decent and the service was good.   The lunch buffet runs 7 days a week from 11:30am - 3pm and it's only $8.99! Plus on Tuesdays it's only $7.99! What a steal!   The only reason this place lost a star is because I was disappointed that they didn't have milai kofta in their buffet. The selection was a bit limited , but what they DID have was excellent.   Oh and take my word for it - the gulab jamuns are THE BEST gulab jamuns I have EVER had.   This place is definitely a hot spot - check it out fo' sure!"}
{"text":"Surprise! We're eating here! I thought we were just stopping here to pick up some sweets, but I'm glad to finally check this place off of my bookmarks.   Bikaner isn't exactly close to where I live and it's pretty safe to say that it's worth the trip. The Pindi Chana was delicious, as was the Afghani Pulao (even though I really dislike dried fruits in my food).   Minus one star because the server kept forgetting our drinks. Nice guy, but very forgetful. Then, when we were paying for our food, it took him forever to get to the till. Then, when picking up sweets, it took someone five minutes to show up at the counter. We were the only people in the restaurant, so I worry how service would be if it was a busy night.   Vegetarians be wary; chicken is listed among the \"vegetarian\" dishes. I wasn't completely worried about this, because my friend Vishnu considers himself a vegetarian, even though he eats fish; chicken and lamb. Lots of ethnic restaurants assume that when you say you don't eat meat, you mean you don't eat beef and/or pork. The servers are careful though, so don't be afraid to ask questions. Be assured that what you will get will be delicious :)."}
{"text":"The buffet was awesome, everything taste great! Enjoyed the Mutton rogan josh... Tasted like home :)"}
{"text":"Seems like this place wasn't really heard much around. I had an invitation today for lunch from a friend, and then I understood that this place serve food as well. From the outer picture of this place it doesn't seem like there are some awesome hidden food treasures inside :P ..   After having food, I just thought how did I miss this place.   The place was big enough to handle our group of 20 people.  Spacious!! I didn't really have a chance to drill through the menu as it was already decided to go for a buffet.   They had chilli chicken,butter chicken, tandoori chicken,lamb curry,fish fry,shahi panneer, panneer tikka,dal, bhindi fry(indian okra), fruits, chat( similar to salsa),dessert,gilebi,gulab jamoon(sweets) and few other salads, yogurt with onion etc. I don't think there was beef and pork.They had saffron rice and naan, papadum too..  The best one that could steal me was chilli chicken. Stuffed up my stomach with it as much as possible as if I might not find that taste again.Shahi panneer, fish fry,panneer tikka were equally good. Fruits were fresh and tasty. Good bollywood music.Service was good too. And the whole bunch is just for 9.99!! A great deal.. and from past two years there was not much increment in the price too?   But what made me to rate it 4 was due to few shortfalls. Tandoori chicken was not at all good. Restroom was just one for both men and women and once you enter through one door there will be two doors w/o any symbols or signs on it. Fortunately the third door had EXIT on it. So now it's your hit or miss with the rest two.  Overall- A must try place.Value and taste for money. Really worth it."}
{"text":"I wrote a flattering review of this place in late 2011. I was so excited and amazed by the food here. They had a small menu with really tasty food. Everything was impressive and the pakoras were the best I'd ever had.   So I got a chance to come back a few weeks ago. The menu had changed, it's freaking huge now. They added my all time favorite, tandoori chicken. So I ordered the tandoori chicken and it was utterly disappointing. It was among the worst I've had in my life. I could swear it had nothing in it except food coloring and maybe a little salt. I tasted the lamb curry and something else I don't remember and there was nothing special about any of it.   My conclusion is they either have a new chef or s/he just gave up on cooking."}
{"text":"Ooh! The flavors. Yes i am starting my review with this. If you have eaten foods in the streets of India, or have gone to the dhabas on the highways in India, you are going to relive that in your mouth.   Bikaner sweets and restaurant is an unconventional restaurant, it has sweet shop on the front and restaurant inside. It has nice dining setup. I went in for dinner and the place turned out to have a dinner buffet. I was craving for good veggies and here they were laid in front of me along with chutneys, pickles and sauces.  Aloo gobhi (potato and cauliflower), sitaphal (pumpkin), dal, were all so authentic and homelike that a morsel in the mouth and it could just melt your heart. Oh! The flavors, the spices, just right. The naans were nicely done and crisp. To top it the dessert, jalebis and gulab jamun were among the best I have had in North America. They can work on their entrance though."}
{"text":"$9.99 buffet lunch is a great deal. They offered butter chicken, shahi paneer, daal, naan (that was a bit tough), veggie pekoras, papadums (soggy) veggie pekoras in a curry sauce, goat, salad, rice, and desserts.    There is lots of space for groups to just show up unannounced, and they sell sweets in their attached bakery.  The only issue I had was that it took about 20 minutes to order and receive some chai tea.  I will definitely be back. It wasn't busy and the food was great :)"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick lunch, the food was pretty good although a couple of the trays were empty and never replenished during our visit (about 45 mins.).  Being from the Toronto area I have definitely been to better Indian buffets, but the price was right.  One thing that was really surprising was that there was this constant beeping noise in the restaurant that never went away, it would go off every 30 seconds or so.  Nobody seemed interested in doing anything about it but it was quite annoying to listen to for that long."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food. I was told by a friend \"in the know\" to eat here tonight for an early dinner. The buffet was $14.99 which seemed expensive but wow. Great food. Every bite of every thing was so exquisite.  The first plate of food I took was literally polished off. I ate every single thing on it. Second plate almost the same and thinking back to the few bites I left behind... I wish I had them now.  It was described to me as a \"hole in the wall\" but it was spacious and had a charm about it that was nice.   We asked about the chefs since the food was so outstanding. They're trained in India, and there are three: one for the Tandoor meats and naan, one for curries and vegetarian and the other something fantastic that I forget now because you see, I am now experiencing a lovely food coma, remembering the butter chicken, rice and tender spice battered fish.   The dessert and chutneys were so good too. So glad we went."}
