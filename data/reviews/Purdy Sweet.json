{"text":"I can sum everything you need to know in two words \"red velvet\"  but really I tried 4 different cookies and none were left.  I shared them with my wife and son and my son was asking for more.  lucky for me I'm only 5 minutes away.  Great place."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN, BEST COOKIES IN NORTH CAROLINA!! My best friend and I arrived here a few minutes after close, but the owner pull cookies out for us anyways! She didn't know, but I had come to visit from CA, and we had been planning this trip for WEEKS! If we didn't get cookies, we would have been soooo sad! We ended up buying the cream cheese Oreo, Mexican hot chocolate, classic chocolate chip, and chocolate sugar. So far, we've only tried the cream cheese Oreo, but the flavor was TO DIE FOR!! The cookie was divine... Not over baked. Not under baked. Soft. Chewy. Perfect. Delectable treat. I only wish that she was open again before we leave to head back home!! If you haven't been here before... GET THERE!! It's worth it!!"}
{"text":"I recently visited Purdy Sweet Gourmet Cookie Shop in Belmont,NC and was extremely pleased with the goodies I bought! There is a variety of cookies to choose from and specialty cookies as well! My #1 is a tie between the Red Velvet w/cream cheese icing and the Cream Cheese Oreo...yes, I am a fan of cream cheese! The custom design cookies had detail that was amazing! Do yourself a favor and visit this gourmet cookie shop!"}
