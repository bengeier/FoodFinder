{"text":"This place was amazing! They were very hospitable and courteous! They treated us like family and the food came out in 8 minutes."}
{"text":"Love!!  Quaint and quick..my husbands first experience with Ethiopian food. Great service and great food!  We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Markato has moved to a new location on South Arville, across from the Orleans' hotel and Casino. It's in a small strip mall, better than the other location.

Food is great as always, just be patient, it takes a while from the time you order till it's served. (20 to 25 minute wait) Otherwise the wait is worth it.

I forgot to take pictures, next time. My favorite is the house Kitfo, an Ethiopian version of steak tartare."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Ethiopian food so I was a bit hesitant at first. The food was absolutely amazing, my party ended up sharing a veggie combo with some meat dishes and that was more than enough for us all (3 people). 

The place was a bit packed when we went so the service was a little slow. We didn't mind though, as the food was above and beyond expectations. Looking forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"We are locals and this is THE ONLY ETHIOPIAN restaurant we go to. 

Reason:
Amazing owner, staff members
Food is delicious
Coffee ceremony is the best

Every time we have visitors from out of town 
This is our go to place to show them a side of Las Vegas most tourist don't know about ..
I just love this place"}
{"text":"They've moved to a new location ...but it was worth the 20 minute drive to their new location. We love this restaurant and most often we get the vegetarian platter. 

The garlic potatoes that we loved so much last time were missing but they were replaced with a fabulous beet dish that was heavenly.

The new location has a lovely outdoor seating area which is perfect although it may be different if you sat next to a table full of smokers.

The prices have increased marginally but still quite affordable.

The staff are lovely and laid back. Go and take your time..."}
{"text":"For those who like eating with their hands*, Ethiopian food might be your new favorite thing. Platters of flavorful mixtures are served atop and alongside rolled injera bread that you tear and wrap around individual bites and pop into your mouth. If you haven't had it before, Merkato is a good place to check it out.

Indoor and outdoor seating available, along with a menu that has options suitable for most dietary restrictions- the vegetarian in our group enjoyed the samosas (beef version also available) while the pescatarian loved the fish goulash (great grilled flavor!), I devoured the house kitfo (basically beef tartare), and we all shared the veggie platter (make sure you get the tomato firfir). Pricing is extremely reasonable, $10-15/pp with generous portions. 

Location is in an industrial area and can be hard to find. Service is attentive but Ethiopian dining is a social event so expect to ask for the check as you will be left to socialize as long as you like. Traditional coffee service also available!

*Okay, sidenote: in Ethiopian culture, you actually are only supposed to use your right hand to eat. Thanks to Brian G for droppin' the knowledge."}
{"text":"Veggie Platter was  awesome..Its a combination of cold and hot with spicy mixtures all wrapped with a very large flat pancake like bread. I will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent and authentic. Friendly, efficient service. I look forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"New location, same great food and service. Never tried Ethiopian food? Try it! It flavorful, stewed beans, vegetables and well flavored meats and fish. It's all served with bread that you eat with called injera. If your not sure what to get, start with vegetarian or meat platter to get a bit of everything."}
{"text":"Born and raised in Vegas without many choices for Authentic food. Anytime we hear about a restaurant serving authentic food we give it a whirl. Didn't think I'd be crazy about Ethiopian food but they have hooked it up. Try and eat mostly Vegan and scored there. No doubt mix in some meat and however they prepare it is great.
Got to know the owner as well and that makes even sweeter. Cool owner and great food."}
{"text":"Very flavorful food, especially the beef tibs! The sambusas were great! Quick service. Only negative was the lamb tibs were way too chewy to enjoy. The server was very friendly."}
{"text":"Haven't tried many Ethiopian restaurants in Las Vegas. Merkato's is actually my first time trying. An Ethiopian restaurant in the valley! I tried the meat platter and loved it. 

The ambiance in this place was nice, the music was really chill and set a nice atmosphere. There is an indoor and outdoor part of the restaurant in which you can eat.

Our hostess showed us how to eat the food without utensils which I thought was really cool. I am always trying to learn more about a different culture, and who knew I would be getting a lesson about Ethiopian culture here! Awesome experience."}
{"text":"The vegetarian platter and lamb tibs were excellent....I've eaten at many etheopian establishments in DC and this is hands down the best I ever had."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I had Ethiopian food once many years ago in Los Angeles but only remember that I liked it. What a treat! We asked the server what she recommended for vegetarians. We ordered the veggie combo for two with tomato firfir added. If you have never had the firfir, I highly recommend it if you like sour and spicy. We were really hungry but that was even too much food for my wife and I. It wasn't a buffet but it sure felt like it. This will be my new regular spot whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"Just moved to Las Vegas and after trying several Ethiopian restaurants, I've come to find that Merkato is not only the tastiest and freshest but the staff and ownership have been nothing short of accommodating, kind and professional. The food flavor is consistent and has plenty of depth, environment is very family friendly and the ownership are quite attentive. Money well spent!"}
{"text":"I only order the veggie combo which is delicious and Amy is always so pleasant.  I used to go to another Ethiopian spot in town but this is now my favorite place."}
{"text":"Was visiting a friend from Las Vegas, who recommended this restaurant - said it was a hole in the wall with amazing food. The food was indeed amazing - some of the best Ethiopian food I've had. Staff was very friendly and accomodating as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First time having Ethiopian food!!!
We had the #11 (veggie platter), #31 (meat platter) and a lamb dish. Veggies and meat all on one platter. I must say...I enjoyed the dinner.
Music-Set the environment and chilled the mood.
Decor-Awesome and authentic
Cool points- There's this fancy coffee thingy that smells INCREDIBLE, even if you're not having coffee. 
Best part- We got taught how to eat our food the RIGHT way w/o utensils by our wonderful hostess. She was so sweet and helped us figure out what to order. AWESOME. 

Verdict??? Will return ESPECIALLY for the coffee ceremony. $20...seems awesome. Total spent $40ish for 3 people and SIGNIFICANT leftovers!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first Ethiopian meal, and the food was really different. I had raw beef with onions, garlic, etc., and their bread is different for sure (not bad). That wasn't the right choice for me, But the service and overall feel in there was off the charts amazing. Relaxed and cheery. It's like we were guests in their home. It might take a couple of meals before I get a taste for the food, but it was such a nice evening, that I will go back many times. It was also a lot less expensive than I thought it would be and the portions are big."}
{"text":"We were getting pedicures at the nail salon a few doors down and the girl working on me told us about this place. 

This is a little hole in the wall place and it appears to be run by a family. I've always wanted to try Ethiopian food, so we gave it a shot. We were the only people in the place and were greeted warmly. We didn't know what we wanted, but the girl taking our order helped us out. We got the vegetarian combo with the grilled beef (see my picture). 

The beef was wonderful! It is seasoned and spicy, but not super spicy. The beef was served in the middle with all the vegetarian goodies out the outer part of the platter. The vegetarian dishes were super delicious as well. It was a lot of beans, dips, potatoes and spinach. 

They serve the platter with a basket of Ethiopian flat bread (called Injera). There is no silverware or utensils, you unroll the Injera and pull off a section, then pick up the beef and other sides with the bread. The Injera is a spongy kind of bread with almost no flavor, it has more of a practical purpose. That platter of beef and the sides was more than enough for my wife and myself. Very filling and absolutely delicious.

One thing to note is that there was no ice. This has also been my experience in Indian restaurants as well. I had two Diet Cokes and they brought me the can and an empty glass.

What a fantastic find, love this place. If you want to give Ethiopian food a try, come here. Very highly recommended."}
{"text":"Merkato is one of my favorite places in town. The service is always great, and you're always treated with a smile. I have brought many different people to Merkato to experience the best Ethiopian food in town. Not only is it a great environment, but the food is absolutely incredible. I always order the vegan option with the tomato firfir. It's enough food for four people, and is about $25! The food is incredible and also incredibly affordable."}
{"text":"Merkato is the best Ethiopian restaurant I have been to so far in Las Vegas.  Staff is great, food is exceptional and their injera is awesome!  Their prices are indeed cheap for the quality and portions.  Ok, think I need to go tonight to get my fix!"}
{"text":"I've tried 4-5 Ethiopian restaurants in Vegas and Merkato is, in my opinion, the best. First of all, the portions are pretty generous. Large sambusa appetizers. A veggie platter can easily feed at least three people. Secondly, the items on the vegetarian platter are so well seasoned. I have not seen another restaurant offer tomato firfir. Thinking about it makes my mouth water!
Service here is fast & great as well with friendly employees, and the menu is easy to read and to choose from.
This is my go-to for anyone's first time trying Ethiopian or any time really :-) 

Update: I suggested Merkato to a group of over a dozen friends a little while back, and the restaurant was extremely accommodating. Everyone loved their food and prices! Would recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Amazing family owned authentic and healthy Ethiopian food. If you have never tried Ethiopian cuisine you must try this delicious spot. Vegans you will be in heaven. So much flavor and ultra healthy. I cannot wait to come back and try more. The coffee ceremony is lovely and you will feel right at home. Thank you for an amazing evening."}
{"text":"Excellent food, fresh and amazing variety. Been going to them for years and they always treat us like family. You won't be sorry! PS If you're new to Ethiopian food be prepared for a wait. Typically takes time to get the fresh food to your table at any Ethiopian restaurant..."}
{"text":"We ate at the old location for several years and were excited to try out this new location tonight. It's in a dark strip mall and is about 1/5th the size of the old place with tables and chairs stuffed in to a too-small space. I should add many of the tables did not appear clean. 

Portions were smaller than I remember, food was generally less seasoned or spiced, and it was runny (veggie combo). Some of our old standbys were missing. It was like a different restaurant and cook/chef altogether. Service was slow and inattentive.  Really disappointed. 

The real kicker was when we got about 15 minutes away, my husband started to complain his stomach hurt and felt strange. Fast forward a few hours and now, I am sitting up in bed after taking pepto with a burning feeling in my stomach and hoping I don't throw up.  

Something is jinky here."}
{"text":"Note: I think the name of this restaurant is actually \"Merkato\" and has moved from the Twain location.  I also posted the following review for the twain location.

As of December 26, 2016, this restaurant has RE-OPENED on Arville 1/2 block south of the Orleans Hotel and it is excellent.  Delicious and plentiful food, very friendly staff, better location, and the food is more interesting and varied than what I have had at many other Ethiopian restaurants.  We got the vegetarian and meat sampler platters and it was more than a very hungry family of 4 could scarf down.  Under $30 for all of us, a great price performer.  Take a short walk from the casino and enjoy some fresh air and some delicious Ethiopian food, where (unlike the buffet) you are encouraged to eat with your hands."}
{"text":"I love this place I come in here a lot the staff will help you decide what to order because it's so much to choose from. I always get the veggie platter my mom ordered seafood however it's so much to eat for a great price you will definitely have left overs. Very friendly staff nice environment they have a small outdoor area. Food usually ready fast I love the fact they have long hours I come when I get off work never busy at night"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurant dining experiences I ever had. I never tried Ethiopian food but I heard it is a very good choice for vegetarians. So we went to this place on a weekday afternoon, nobody was dining there. The waitress was extremely nice and welcoming. We didn't know what to order just told her that we don't eat meat. So we ended up having a veggie platter and tomato firfir. Huge portion. The flavor is so intense and refreshing like fireworks in your mouth. It was GOOD! Forget about all the buffets for vegetarians here, compare to this abomination, all fake news! It like a vegetarian buffet for two under $28. We ate till we were dizzy and still had leftover for dinner.
Discovering Ethiopian food in Vegas is a huge plus for us to come back again. Highly recommended for vegetarians."}
{"text":"We are here in vacation from Portland,Oregon where we eat Ethiopian food all the time. Even after a week in Vegas with 400 dollar gourmet dinners and amazing shows this was the best evening we have had!

The food is amazing! The owner even more so.

The Gored Gored was the best I have ever had!
The coffee ceremony was so much fun. This is not something we have experienced before. From roasting the beans to serving in the traditional Ethiopian pot and cups the ladies here made us feel like we were close friends invited into their home. They explained all of the steps and meanings while chit chatting like we were old friends.

The only thing I regret about having dinner here is the fact we don't live close enough to go on a more regular basis!

If your looking for great Ethiopian food and even greater atmosphere and service this is the way to go!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem.  I have gone here twice with friends and have not left disappointed. I have to say the coffee is some of the best I've tasted,"}
{"text":"Amazing Ethiopian food and waitress was very friendly! Will definitely come back again when visiting Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a countless amount of times in its old location. This was my favorite Ethiopian restaurant. Unfortunately I never left a review until now after they've moved to the new location off Trop on Arville. I'm not a fan of this new location. It's a third of the size of the old place and the food tastes different. I've been to the new location twice and both times didn't compare to what I've grown used to from the old restaurant. I'm guessing they have a new cook??? On my last visit I ordered the vegetarian sampler. It was just ok. There were a few items on the platter I wasn't too fond of. With the samplers they change the options often and they don't list exactly what each dish is. For that reason I think I'll keep trying other places until I find the perfect sampler lol! I hate wasting food especially Ethiopian which I love! I'll likely come back here for the Tibs and Special Kitfo which I love but not for the veggie sampler."}
{"text":"This was my and my boyfriends first time trying Ethiopian food :-)
We got the vegetarian sambusas which were delicious! 
We also got the veggie platter... I wasn't particularly a fan of it, but my boyfriend almost ate the entire platter himself! He also got a coffee which he said was the smoothest black coffee he has ever had. 
The staff were so kind and overall it was just a great experience!!"}
{"text":"Portions seem to have gotten smaller since the move, but the quality and taste have not suffered. The place always seems to be bustling, and service is great. Always affordable and delicious. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I tried Ethiopian food for the first time. We ordered a vegetarian combination with Kitfo (beef) and it was delicious! Honestly, I leaved the place with a belly full. I wish I was hungrier to finish the whole plate! The plate I believe is enough for 3 individuals. I was with a friend today. The food is great and the price is reasonable. I highly recommend it and I cannot wait to come again."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the vegan selection and their  authentic bread . 
The owner of the restaurant is pleasant and very friendly.
Ethiopian hospitality is the best!!!
A Must visit place!!!"}
{"text":"This is the first time eating and drinking here you must try there coffee..nice place to hang out.."}
