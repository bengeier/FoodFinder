{"text":"I went to this place on my birthday because I had driven by so many times and needless to say was interested. I loved the overall atmosphere, it was so fun and the waitress was very nice. The menu does have a TON of choices but as far as the foods quality goes, I wasn't in love with it. It was a good time though so i'd probably go back."}
{"text":"My son and i go to Wagon Yard, or atleast used to, about every other Sunday morning for breakfast. Today was the last time. Our waitress, to use the term lightly, was a middle aged, petite woman that looked like she woke up from a hang over. Our drink orders came out and my son noticed that his Dr Pepper tasted like syrup gone bad so we flagged her down and requested something else. I fully realize that this was not her problem, but this was the best thing about our service and food that occured during our visit. I had a breakfast plate that the menu indicated would come with eggs, potatoes, a hamburger patty and toast. My son had a hot pastrami with fries. Nothing to difficult about this order! The plates came out and i asked for tobasco. The waitress went off and got my tobasco and dropped it off a table across the room that didnt request it. We got a laugh out of that. So i ate the majority of my eggs without the normal condiment i enjoy just so they would not get cold. Once she did come within range of our table and i gestured for the tobasco once again i was almost done anyway so it was kind of pointless. Now on to the hamburger patty. I am a bachelor so i am very well versed in what a next day reheated burger patty tastes like. This was not even that good. I asked it be medium. It came out charred, crumbly and just plain bad. My sons pastrami did not appeal to him and i could see that it was undercooked as were the limp mess that were the side of fries. We both gagged our way through this mess. At this point i realized they had completely stiffed me of my breakfast potatoes. We were dropped the tab on the table without ever once being asked how are food was or if we needed anything else. When the waitress came for the ticket to run my card i stopped her and explained that i was jipped the potatoes on the menu and that my burger patty still had the spur marks where the cowboy kicked it she made zero attempt at an apology or providing any sort of customer service. Instead she came back with the bill run at full cost and dropped a stryrafoam carton of potatoes on the table stating she thought i didnt want them to begin with. A strange remark considering they are clearly listed as being part of my brweakfast and i never once requested they be left off. Again no apology was forthcoming. No offer to discount a really bad meal. I have friends in the food service industry and i know they work hard for their tips so i am usually one that gives no less then 20%. In this case i grudgingly paid the bill in full on my card and left a quarter for her troubles. That is about 20 cents more then was deserved. Do yourself a favor and avoid this hysterical mess of bad bar, a bad restaurant and bad people running it. Goodbye Wagon Yard and good riddance."}
{"text":"The fiance and I decided to start venturing into the unknown... this was our first stop.  Nothin fancy inside or out (but a HUGE sign that you cannot miss). Our waitress was really nice. I ordered the patty melt with wedge fries, he ordered the mushroom steak burger (or something like that) with regular fries and a side salad. And a \"what the hell\" we'll share a 6 piece order of suicide wings was tossed in at the end.  1. The Patty Melt Really REALLY greasy. I picked it up and it was basically running down my arm. The wedge fries were AMAZING though (and I love anything that I can use as an excuse to eat ranch dressing)  2. The Mushroom Burger Comes WITHOUT a bun (Weird. Fiance had to ask for a bun with his burger) but was really big and extremely tasty. If we go back, I'd get this and hopefully someone will be there to finish half for me since it's so large. His fries were good but I liked the thick fries better. Salad was boring, but neither of us expected much from a plain side salad.  3. The Wings We ordered suicide. These were not suicide. They were for wimps! Although they weren't as spicy as I'd hoped, they were still really darned good.  Although my food wasn't the best, I think I need to give this place another chance since my fiances food was so good. Plus all of the above only cost us 19 bucks. We'll be back... probably on a Sunday or Monday when they have the All-U-Can-Eat Beef Ribs!"}
{"text":"Almost always the best burger in town for me.  Did have one burger that tasted like the meat was a little old, but I gave them another chance and has been OK since.  It's a laid back place and the prices on the burgers and such are good.  Steak prices seem a little high, so I never have ordered on.  But, if they are as big as the burgers, maybe that is why they charge more.  One of my favorite places to go for a burger."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall bar and grill."}
{"text":"Our group ordered so many different things and they were all great!  One of the best steaks I've had.  GREAT Band too!"}
{"text":"This is the third time I have ordered food here. The first time I ordered the French Dip. It took 20 minutes to get my order. The sandwich was decent but the \"dip\" was extremely oily and greasy tasting. The fries, over half were so hard you could break a tooth on them. I imagine they were left over from a previous batch and were re-cooked.   The second trip I ordered the chicken sandwich and it was above average as were the fries.  It took nearly 20 minutes to get my order. I would give this order 3 1/2 stars.  This prompted me to order the same chicken sandwich today as a takeout. It took 30 minutes to get my order. I live around the corner so I took my first bite in less than 5 minutes of receiving it. I couldn't even bite all the way through because of the grizzle. So I took a bite from the other side with the same results. I removed the extremely small and thin patty and tried cutting away the grizzle but found the entire grilled chicken breast was so rubbery, overly boiled, old or some other unknown reason that it was entirely inedible. Even it I chose to attempt to eat it, it was physically impossible. I was so hungry I threw away the \"grilled chicken\" patty and ate a lettuce, cheese and mayonnaise sandwich. The fries were mostly adequate but the chicken ranks as the worst I have ever ordered and because of this, I must rank my 3 attempts of eating here, one star. I am deeply disappointed with this since it is within walking distance of my house."}
{"text":"*** 2.5 stars   My expectations weren't too high of this place knowing that it was a bit run down. I usually like these types of places because of where I grew up but wasn't really feeling the food.   We went there around 6ish on Friday night... The happy hour specials were good! Half off apps. and 2 dollar bottles or drafts. The atmosphere is quite like a saloon and as said before a bit run down. There were definitely alot of what appeared to be \"locals\" when we were there.   It is definitely true what is said about the prices but maybe we ordered the wrong thing cause we definitely got what we paid for. I ordered the super wagon burger and my wife ordered the 1/2 rack of ribs. My burger was darn big I must say and was cooked nicely. The problem is that it didn't have any flavor. It appeared to be handmade but didn't have any seasoning and didn't have the best taste. I saw on the menu they were offering dishes that were \"Char Grilled\" but am surprised they didn't cook the burger on the grill. I think that would have been the difference along with a little bit of seasoning salt and some pepper. The same goes for the Ribs... They tasted like they were cooked in the oven only because they were tender but had very bland seasoning and were smothered in sauce. I would like to think I can throwdown with some ribs and one thing I know is that they need to be finished on the grill! Not only for taste but for texture.   I'm not going to say this place was terrible but they completely missed the mark on the two things we ordered. I really liked the homemade potato salad though.   I/we will probably back during happy but not for a full on dinner. Don't have high expectations for this place. The atmosphere is chill and the people are nice but if you are used to going to higher end spots this place will either humble you or make you want to run out the door."}
{"text":"I have gone here a couple of times, once for lunch and once for breakfast.  The lunch was alright, and the breakfast was pretty good!!  I like the fact that they have a GIANT beer that I have to hold with both hands.  They have cool stuff going on in the back (horseshoes, sand volleyball, etc.).  I like this place, my husband and I actually thought that we may start going there more often to get an inexpensive breakfast and beer! :-)"}
{"text":"Im only giving 1 start because I can't give 0.  The waitress was pleasant and extremely helpful, but not dressed appropriately.  The Food was inedible. We ordered a Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich and a Steak&Fries. The sandwich was bland, the cottage cheese tasted rancid, and the fries were way overdone. We ordered the steak medium rare, and it came well done, tough, and smothered in pepper (no other flavor at all). When we sent it back, the replacement was Raw inside, and grey. We did not feel safe eating it.  The manager comp'd the steak (but not the fries!) and we were not thrilled but then it got worse.  As we were towards the end of the (spectacularly disappointing) meal, a live baby roach ran across my fiance's plate. This is unacceptable and I will be reporting this place to the AZ Department of Health"}
{"text":"Ok breakfast for the money. Older place with a little bit of a smell to it but friendly service. This place could use a fresh coat of paint and spring cleaning but has a lot of character."}
{"text":"Wow!  I was just telling someone the same thing just yesterday.  I drove by that place a thousand times, but didn't stop (it looks dumpy, no curb appeal) and to my surprise the food was very good and priced very fair.  I now call it one of my little hangouts, eaten there at least 30 time for breakfast, lunch, dinner and a few late night snacks and am still surprised that they nail it every time.   A great place to eat or drink that doesn't dent the pocketbook too much and they have country karaoke that 90% of the time sounds real good.   A nice group of regulars welcome newcomers and make a newbie feel at home."}
{"text":"I usually visit this place about once a week or so during happy hour. I think the prices are awesome, the service is great as long as you don't sit at the bar (a local thing I think). The kids and I love the wings! I've recommended this place to several friends. Definitely a A++ dive bar.  *** I love how they greet you when you enter the place. A lot of little dive bars miss that."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for breakfast... Come check it out! We come on Sundays and absolutely love the breakfast... And conversation."}
{"text":"My cousin plays  on a pool league every week and that is enjoyable. Not the best service but I was impressed by the quality and amount of food!"}
{"text":"Recently went because I had heard that it was under new ownership and wanted to see if it had changed.  We went a few years ago and the food was good but the service was just ok.  Since the last time we were there the place is clean and everyone is very nice.  We love their food as it is your traditional classic american food.  We look forward to the new volleyball courts and wish the new owners luck.  I recommend the tex burger."}
{"text":"This place is horribly awesome. My husband and I love our dive bars, this one makes the list! Our waitress was very friendly, prompt service. The food was mediocre at best. The bartender may or may not have been a drag queen. The highlight of the evening was the older crowd there for karaoke night. It was a 'special' evening to say the least. We'll be back, I'm sure, but it won't be for the food..."}
{"text":"So disgusted how this cockroach was on my girlfriends shoulder as she was eating and then the very large woman manager you cannot miss her she said we will take care of you guys, well we had been having some drinks and food and our bill was $58 she took off $4 for having a COCKROACH on my woman's shoulder we stepped on it and took a picture, highly highly do NOT recommend going there, not even McDonald's would be so rude to customers about a large roach on someone while eating at their restaurant, basically the large woman Angela does not know how to handle situations, UNLESS YOU LIKE COCKROACHES do NOT go eat or drink there !!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a dive bar. But that being said, a good one! Even though it's run down and could use a cleaning and reorganization, it has a great atmosphere and low prices. The food is pretty decent and very afdordable"}
{"text":"I love it here on the weekends!  My girlfriends and I like to come here for dinner on Friday nights to start our weekend. I will recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Great place to step back in time. when a bar/saloon and grill was what it;s supposed to be. It's a place where you should be able to throw the peanut shells on the floor. Great grub and atmosphere and busy if you're expecting a pristine place it's not for you. if you like that old west feeling it's where you should check out.  great happy hours too!!!!"}
{"text":"yes it is a throw back in time, went for first time today. looks maybe a bit tired but food was spot on. i'm a very picky eater i got the smaller hamburger and fries and could barley finish.so much food my friend got the all you can eat beef ribs (sunday and monday) bartender/ waitress was prompt and friendly  will def be back."}
{"text":"Now thats a hamburger YA HOO! Service is okay but not great its always either hot or cold. Great prices and we will be back."}
{"text":"Great lunch! Great prices! Our server, Nikki, was so helpful! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Terrible service!!! I went with a party of 8 that got separated into 2 tables and was still charged for the party even though we didn't get to sit together. Waitress brought my nephews meal to me and my boyfriend and after she realized the mistake tried to give our eaten food back to my nephew. My family and I will never go back!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with my girl friends. Didn't have high hopes, it's a honky tonk. Won't be going back for breakfast... I'm air it'll do just fine for drinks though."}
{"text":"Went here with friend.  Used to go here years ago.  It has changed.  Food was terrible as service had a two for one coupon but will never be back.  Smelled and bathrooms were not clean.  Dont waste your money or time.  what a dissapointment"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or anything. French Toast w/ sausage LINKS is the best, except for the steak and eggs. Burgers and wings both great; just generally good food!"}
{"text":"Seriously, the charm of this place is the people. It's been through allot in the last couple of years, changing hands and reverting back to the owner who had it for decades. This last loser stole everything of value, defaced the sign and closed the doors leaving an entire staff of loyal employees jobless because he couldn't get a liquor license. It WILL re-open. The bar tenders know how to pour a good drink, the food is cheap and good but the staff and patrons are like family. Think \"Cheers\" in the west. Can't wait to be able to walk in again and welcome back June and Eliot. :)"}
{"text":"This a downhome type of place that I hadn't been to in years.  Karaoke was good but the food was very underwhelming tonight.  Had a very sub-par $10.95 Chicken Fried Steak (cheap frozen beef fritters).  My friend has fish that was good but tarter sauce was horrible.  Our sides were wrong, drink was wrong!  Waitress was nice but very busy, forgot our salads, didn't correct wrong sides and never refilled our drinks!  Doubtful I'll ever return!"}
{"text":"The best part, was the music. From what I understand, it is under different management? I lost a big part of my appetite when I received my order. Why? The plate was dirty, underneath, on the back of the plate. I could feel it when I took the plate. It looked like the chili had been spilled & only the front off the plate was washed. The hamberger bun was soggy on the bottom, the hamburger was fair. Would I go back? Probably not."}
{"text":"Great bartender! Came for happy hour this time and got the dinner special...SOOOO good chimichanga was amazing!"}
{"text":"The biggest shock of my recent culinary exploits was that The Wagon yard, a dark dingy looking place I'd passed by a million times would turn out to be not only a place I would enjoy eating, but a place that I would find myself visiting at least three times a month. The first time I stopped in it was almost out of desperation for lack of other close by open breakfast options. When I stepped inside it was exactly what I'd always imagined, dark and divey, with occupants at the bar just before eleven A.M. I was greeted almost immediately ajd told to sit anywhere id like, this wasnt the reception I'd come to expect from similar locations. I found a breakfast menu waiting at the table, the options were what you would expect to find at places like this, \"two eggs plus this and that\" and \"pancakes and such\", the prices? insanely low, Id be so user to eating at overpriced breakfast establishments in Scottsdale so I was delighted to find that this place had full meals for extremely low prices, yet a part of me remained skeptical. I had a two egg platter with sausage and wheat toast. I was shocked that they used real egg, and tasty ingredients. I was in love, the service was quick, honest, down to earth, and all around pleasant.  since my first visit I have been back enough times to fill one of their loyalty cards and treated myself to a ribeye and eggs at a discounted rate, and even then I wasnt let down, the steak was quality and cooked just how I liked it. I'd recommend this place to anyone who, like myself, would never think to give this place a chance. like the saying goes; \" you cant judge a book by its cover\", visit The Wagon Yard and treat yourself to a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Must say MOST disappointed!! Was in this past Saturday and my group had to sit in two different booths.  We couldn't even talk to one another so not sure how that qualifies as a large party.  I was not explained a tip was added so I added my own.  I realized today I tipped twice.  My sister called to see if anything could be done since technically a group of 4 is not a party.  Angel hung up the phone on her without any regard or care.  RUDE!!!  Our food was also given to someone else and then given back to us after the plate was eaten off of.  The waitress did bring a different plate but the ribs that came back was the same eaten off ribs?!?! My steak was not eatable and I was told it would be taken care of since I didn't eat it but the check came with nothing adjusted!  NOT HAPPY AND WILL NEVER GO BACK!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for old saloons and cool bars.  Been going to the Wagon Yard on and off throughout the years ever since since my wife & I moved here 29 years ago. My wife goes there every Friday night for Karaoke and I go with her on occasion.  Although I've been here many times I never reviewed the Wagon Yard. So where do Ibegin with this place?  To start honestly the Wagon Yard is not going to be everyone's bag. At first glance the menu is fairly standard for a country western saloon. What I like about the' Wagon Yard is they get a nice mx of people not just a western crowd.  They have a harty breakfast menu, a nice selection of sandwiches for lunch and sevreal dinner specials. None of which are pricey. Everything is very reasonalbe there.  My wife normally orders either the mini chef salad with ham. Why because the regular chef's salad with ham & turkey is huge. Even the mini chef salad is more than enough for one person. If she doesn't get the mini checfs salad she will order one of their burgers. She says they are always made to perfection & taste good.   For me I think over the years I've tried everything on their menu. My favorite is the liver & onions. Just make sure they don't over cook it. If done correctly it is FREAKING PHENOMINAL. in fact I'm salivatng thinking about it right now. :-)   CUSTOMER SERVICE: SERVICE: Our waitress normally is DJ she is Super (super) friendly and always accomodating.  FOOD: The food isn't out of this world phenomenal, but they do have decent prices and okay portion size. AMBIENCE: This is not a fancy place and they even have a pretty decent size dance floor where we can only imagine the amount of line dancing going on. CONCLUSION: Been coming here for 29 years why stop now. Overall rating of either a 3.5 or a 4"}
{"text":"Growing up in Canton, Texas with both kinds of music, country and western..., what I remember most as a young boy was the food and the people.  The Wagon Yard is a delightful surprise that makes no attempts to be something it is not, and that honesty is most certainly felt in it's food.  The RIB's are nothing short of amazing and the people are a moment in time when America was a place of genuine character.  Coming from Hollywood where everything is fruits, nuts or flakes, finding a place that reminds me of what was best in America along with the sights, sounds and food to go with it, is a treasured feeling well worth the wait.  When you go there, don't be in a rush, take your time and enjoy the moment, it is well worth the effort to slow down and enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The ladies (Angela, Nikki & Brandi) really take care of the customers week in & week out & we don't always make it easy for them but it's always service with a smile.  Storm, the karaoke host (Tue-Thu) is the best in the business and keeps this place rocking.  The food's good & the drinks are made well.  My home away from home, I highly recommend this place to anyone that likes good service, good music, good food & drinks."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for a date night this past Friday. He warned me it was a bit of a dive but I don't really mind. Some dives are real gems! We were in at about 7 for dinner. As soon as we arrived we noticed a car parked in the handicap spot that had no handicap plate or placard. We go inside and are told to sit wherever we want. I like that because with my hubby being in a wheelchair, we often get seated in the back aka out of the way. The menu had a lot of options but we were there for the steak! I ordered the New York strip medium well. Which I've had at other places and it came out great. Our waitress Renee brought us drinks quickly and was right there when we were ready to order. Our food came out pretty fast and she actually stayed at the table and asked us to cut into our steaks to make sure they were okay. I loved this because as a person who doesn't like a bloody or desert dry steak, I hate cutting into it and having to wait 10-15mins for the staff to come back so I can tell them it's not done right. Especially if it's over cooked. So we cut in and I could immediately tell mine was dry and very hard to cut. So I cut the center and it was soft so I said it's okay. And it really was. Besides about 1/2 inch on the end the rest was good. The fries were hard and dry. But the steak and salad and drinks were on point. Renee was amazing! It was overpriced a bit ($23), and the inside is in major need of updating, but I would definitely go back! Thanks Renee!"}
{"text":"Don't make any mistake about it,this is a bar. Looks like one,smells like one,people up at the bar drinking early.That being said ,great breakfast,good price,wonderful service. Really a great place,can't wait to do dinner here."}
{"text":"Certainly one of the BEST burgers I've had in a long time! It's simple yet very well seasoned and juicy. Also, still one of the BEST places for wings as well."}
{"text":"Worst experience we ever had! Would not recommend this restaurant. The waitress we had was very nice but the food was horrific we sent the steak back because it was burnt. They came out with Second steak and could not cut it even with the steak knife. The manager came and told us our meals were on the house but never come back and find a different place to eat! We were shocked but still willing to pay for our drinks so we waited for the waitress to come with the bill and then a different waitress came and told us to leave! We were not rude , loud or inappropriate with any one! Two lessons learned only order steaks at a steakhouse and a place you imagined that would suggest hospitality was non existent at that establishment! Enter at your own risk!!!"}
{"text":"I have been driving by this place for over 17 years and we never stopped until tonight. Lured in by the $2.00 happy hour beers we went for dinner. The place itself is a dive which is NOT a bad thing when describing a place. Dive bars can be the most fun sometimes. The band was setting up when we arrived. They regularly have live music and do karaoke.   The place is nothing fancy but it needs a very deep cleaning. We were seated at a booth with a large collection of various dried sauces on the wall. Our server was Carlos and he was very friendly. He took our drink orders and came back later to get our food order. We ordered the potato skins to start off which turned out to be two large potatoes cut in half. Typically you hollow them out a bit before you fill them but that didn't happen. They could have used another minute under the broiler as the cheese was not completely melted but there was a generous amount of bacon on each one. I had the chicken fried chicken with mashed potatoes and a side salad and my husband ordered the honey mustard chicken sandwich with coleslaw. Neither of us finished our meals. As soon as I saw the that both of my pieces of chicken were perfectly round I knew they were frozen chicken patties covered in gravy. The mashed potatoes were actually smashed potatoes and bland. There was 4 pieces of lettuce and an orange wedge on my plate. I'm not sure if that was the side salad or they just forgot to bring it out all together and honestly I just didn't care. My husbands chicken sandwich was dripping everywhere from the sauce overload yet he said it lacked flavor.  Dinner came to $33.00 for the two of us before the tip.  Go for the happy hour bar specials and karaoke but skip the entrees."}
{"text":"After seeing the giant sign for years we decided to stop in yesterday to check it out. Overall it was pretty good. Our server (I wish I got his name) was really personable and went over the menu and drink options for us. We both ordered sandwiches that were tasty. This is definitely a hole in the wall BUT if you like places like this like I do then I'd recommend stopping in. We were told they have live music/karaoke most of the week."}
{"text":"If I could get this place negative stars, I definitely would. There was only one lady working the entire floor.  She was behind the bar and she was our waitress at a table.  She only came over to the table about 2-3 times. All the other times I had to walk up to the bar to get what I needed and wanted. She was very rude every time I asked for something.. The food was also absolutely not the most tasteful..."}
{"text":"I drive past this place daily and (thankfully) I finally decided to give it a shot.  $.55 wings m-f 2-7 for happy hour.  They're large, juicy, and perfectly fried; my new favorite wings (for the price)!"}
{"text":"Good prices and nice staff. I will say though, the place needs an upgrade and less karaoke nights. It's frustrating when you come to eat food at a restaurant and almost every night people are doing karaoke."}
{"text":"I definitely give this place five stars but it's not for the food. It's for the people. It is the most charming hole in the wall. The staff and patrons treat you like family. If you like to country western dance, this is the place to go on Friday and Saturday nights! Now it's not the place to go if you want to meet young singles. But if you want a real authentic country western dance experience with the best people phoenix has to offer, come to the Wagon Yard."}
{"text":"friendly bartender/waitress. Inside was nicer than I expected.Large clean bar and seating area and food was great. Had the Philly and it was well prepared. Will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu"}
{"text":"New owners New Menu Blah blah   I used a restaurant.com coupon and wish I hadn't.   Dumpy, bad service, worst food.   3 kids and myself for dinner during the week,   I had the steak, a nice rib eye ...BARF  IT WAS ABOUT 1/4 INCH THICK, GREY IN COLOR, NO SEASONING, AND 2 GRILL MARKS (SERIOUSLY 2) IT TASTED LIKE IT WAS BOILED.   I SENT IT BACK (VERY UNUSUAL OF ME)   I went with the ribs, which were Gray and boiled tasting too but the sauce was good and I was done!   She sucked at refilling water, it spilled everywhere when she did and she never mentioned any kind of discount or anything.   2 kids want wings, which were on special for $0.35 each IF you buy drinks @ 1.75 each. (waitress proceeds to tell me this is CHEAPER then buying the wing plate.   1.75x 2 = 3.50  12 @ 0.35 = 4.20  total 7.70 for 12 wings and 2 kids hopped up on Dr Pepper.   I ordered the 5.50 for 12 wings. and 2 waters.   PS Wings were good.   Kid #2 got fish... it was greasy and chewy, she didn't even eat all.   The salads we OK the dressings were OK.   Don't bother unless it is the bar your are after, at least the bar girl was cute."}
{"text":"Like some of the other reviews, I initially went to the Wagon Yard because of a coupon (you guys should print more, looks like it brings you business!).  We've been a few times and the food is probably a 3 overall, it really depends on what you order.  The service staff have always done a good job, but I think we always get the head waitress (or is she the owner?).  But the place is just cool, so we keep going back.  If you go later on a Saturday evening, they have karoke and the people are actually pretty good.  They have a crowd of regulars, who want to make sure you feel welcome.  It's mostly an older crowd (I'm in my 20s), but on an evening when you are just looking for some chill entertainment, and if you love country music, check this place out.  It's like going to the Buffalo Chip in Cave Creek before everyone found out about it.   And not having to drive so far."}
{"text":"Delicious great food  fun crowd. Recommend the breakfast ... nice mimosas.. will be back"}
{"text":"Came to the Wagon Yard for breakfast and I got to tell you how.........wait for it! Well I rate this a 3 because well 1st they didn't have enough help.....and you asked for something it never came back. Overall for a dive bar it was ok. Remember when ordering eggs with cheese they mix the American cheese in with your eggs so you don't get the shape of the square cheese just sitting on top........lol"}
{"text":"Great place for karaoke.  Good place for friends to hang out.  The wings and the burger were good!"}
{"text":"Extremely poor service had a large party didn't seat us together still charged a large party tip didnt refund when accidentally doubled the tip and management very unprofessional hanging up on us when asked to make good on the mistake.  Will not recommend and will not return."}
{"text":"From the outside it doesn't look to appealing and neither does the inside, but the food is good! We had a coupon for the place,that's how we found out about it. I am a big french fry fan, and the fries were pretty good! Over all good service and food."}
{"text":"Wanted to enjoy a burger and some wings. At first impression this was a nice place with country western atmosphere and friendly staff. However It took over 10 minutes just to get our order taken. We were brought drinks right away. Another 10 minutes after that our order was taken.  We arrived around 550 pm. 645 rolled around and still were sipping on pepsi with not even an appetizer in sight or any sign of our server. Others who had came after we did were being brought food.  I really wanted to try the food here but was so angry we walked out and went somwhere else."}
{"text":"Wagon Yard used to be awesome, but it has since fallen to \"still pretty good\".  Their happy hour wing special is still good, it used to be 25 cent wings, now it's 30 cents. Their steaks are pretty good but for some reason used to be better. Their bbq ribs are still great though.  I don't know, maybe it was the service. The first time my wife and I went we couldn't wait to come back, and then we brought a friend, and then we went again and wasn't quite as good, and then we went another time and the quality diminished just a little bit more...  Maybe they're in a slump, who knows. Hopefully they come out of it. Wagon yard is the quintessential rustic western food and drink joint. they have karaoke very often, and they even have a coupon in the Entertainment book if I remember correctly, so it's worth trying at least once."}
{"text":"The staff at Wagon Yard is so awesome!  The owner, Elliot is amazing.  If you ever want to have a party they can accommodate a lot of people and have a room in the back that works out fantastic.  The food is great and portion sizes are quite large!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"After spending a few hours at a friend's house in the early afternoon we decided to go to the Wagon Yard after discovering another establishment nearby was closed Sundays. My two friends had been there already but I had never heard of it, my usual stomping grounds being Central/West Phoenix, a little of Tempe. I have a couple friends that just moved into this area, so it looks like my territory might expand. :D The place was described to me as 'rustic' before we arrived, which made sense from the name, and after we parked and went inside we realized the owners must have spruced up the place a bit since the last time my friends had been here. There are booth, table, and bar seating options and the back patio is HUGE!   There were several people hanging out quietly at the bar, not too many people eating when we were there (before 5pm). Beers are discounted on Sundays (and Mondays?) here, so it was only $3 for a HUGE German-sized mug of domestic. My friends didn't have to order another beer while we were there because the mugs were so gigantic. This was certainly impressive! Hot chocolate is on the menu, but they were out of it when we were there. An all-you-can-eat rib deal for just under $10 was going on at the time, so two of us ordered that and the third ordered his usual, the shrimp plate. The server guy was quite friendly and accommodating, and we received our order just as we requested. All of the food came out with perfect timing, and he came over to check on us at all the right times. Restrooms were clean and basic, I visited a few times to wash the BBQ off my hands after we ate. Music was a local country station.  The ribs were okay, I'm not usually a fan of the big, non-babyback ones so that probably has something to do with it, but even from that point of view we both finished off two plates each. The meat was quite tender. The first plate came with 5 large beef ribs and the second came with 3 (thank goodness, because we both had one leftover). The second plate's BBQ sauce seemed much tangier than the first. The ribs came with a choice of soup or salad AND choice of potato (mashed, baked after 5pm, potato salad, frieds, cole slaw). I ordered the soup and mashed. My friend ordered the fries and salad. I stole a couple off his plate - the fries were tasty, not overcooked, but were crinkly like Ore-Ida brand. Might be a boost if they served steak fries instead, but these were good. The standard salad looked fresh and was a good size with our choice of dressing. The cup of soup was a tasty vegetable beef, but nothing to write home about. The large side of potatoes came with a choice of white or brown gravy, and seemed hand-mashed - yum!! I hardly touched my potatoes in order to make room for the ribs, but they were just as good the next day.   All in all, the quality of the food isn't super top notch but it wasn't bad either. Affordable prices for a large quantity of food, and the staff was quite friendly! We left with big bellies. I'd come back. :)"}
{"text":"a whole in the wall bar, but thats why ppl like it. they have karoake nights which is fun and its very laid back, not usually is a big crowd. the bar stuff is nice and the chili is good. they have pool tables, dart, bean toss, and a couple arcade games. pretty cheap as well."}
{"text":"The last tome I was in I was waiting for my motorcycle to be finished woth service next door. The wings tastes awful and the fries were clearly frozen store bought. The place still smelled like rotten feet. Later that night I got terribly sick and had diarreah for hours. Clearly the chicken had turned. Will not go back! Truly awful!"}
{"text":"Wagon Yard is older than dirt. It's been there since forever.... and it is the same now as it was back then. Wagon Yard is the least cowboy-est cowboy steakhouse in Phoenix that i know. It IS like going to Cave Creek before Cave Creek became the annex of North Scottsdale. Prices are cheap, portions are big and the atmosphere is completely unpretentious. I went the first time because i was WAAAAAAAY up on Bell (which was then the north edge of civilization) and most recently, because i had a coupon. It was well worth the stop."}
{"text":"A dive, in a good way. Not fancy, but tasty! We are here for Saturday morning breakfast. The crowd is a mix of folks that seem to have been here all night and hard working folks out so mom doesn't have to cook. Our breakfast was nicely prepared and delivered quick. Service with a smile by cheery and professional wait staff that had no need to write down our order. (Ask for Nikki). I'm always impressed by a real pro the can perfectly remember an entire tables order.   If you are in the hood one morning, you can hide here and enjoy a fine breakfast."}
{"text":"I'm new to the area. Attending Mmi. saw this place and stopped in. Great dive bar atmosphere. Cold beer good food. Friendly staff, prices are decent. I'll come back for sure."}
{"text":"I suggested place after walking past. Incredibly affordable eats. Been in AZ 9 months...best meal I've had. My girlfriend couldn't finish hers. Great honky tonk (not country pop twang until someone requested luke bryan) and great service. 3. 1.2.3 servers attempted to help us. Order meat mediun rare and prepare to be satiated."}
{"text":"HAHAHA..this was an adventure gone bad.  My friend and i saw this while we were hanging out. We were hungry and thought....why not, maybe it is a diamond in the rough.  NOPE!!!  it's just rough. The burger i had was bland. no seasoning at all. I've eaten better burgers off a george foreman before... ...  fries were mushy     and it was awkwardly quiet and dead in there."}
{"text":"This place is great, we recently moved to the area and wanted to try some local eateries. My wife myself and 3 of my younger kids went there for happy hour...2-6 Monday through Friday.  They had half off appetizers and .45 wings everything we got was excellent, with the bonus of local bar people watching! We even went back the next morning for breakfat, again cheap and excellent.  We will definitely make this one of our new spots to hang. Also Monday through Thursday they have 1 dollar drafts and bottles. ..yes 1 dollar. Can't wait to go back without the kids, it looked like they also had a good karaoke and dance floor set up."}
{"text":"came here on a wednesday for the all you can eat spaghetti, i think its 8.95 and it comes with a salad or soup. they give you some much spaghetti and sauce and meatballs you wont be asking for more.. I almost finished it but didnt want to push it. server was really nice older lady. will be back, it was good"}
{"text":"We went there for breakfast today. Good. Over easy eggs cooked perfectly. Cory waited on us and was great. Bloody Mary's . It is an older bar but worth a look"}
{"text":"This place is one of a kind!  My wife and I went on the nite of 12/5 and not only got a   real good meal for peanuts, but a wedding too!  I too used the Entertainment coupon.  Give this place a try if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Call Jon Taffer, this bar needs rescuing!! Hubby and I were out for a birthday adventure day and thought we would try it. Should have turned around as soon as I used the womans room. Filthy, smelled horrid, gross. Felt like pressing my luck so ordered a couple of whiskey and sevens. Holy hell...not sure what well they got their whiskey out of but I couldn't even finish it (and that says a lot!!) Hubby ordered hot pastrami sandwich, he said was fine. That was then. Hubby has spent a lot of time in the bathroom since we've been home, that's all I'm saying. I ordered a 1/2 sandwich with cup of their house vegetable beef soup. The soup was rancid tasting. It had bubbles around the edge?! Ended eating my wonderbread Oscar mayer turkey sandwich and haven't had screaming diarrhea yet....You can be a dive bar without being a nasty bar."}
{"text":"I recently moved here from TX and my parents told me about this place, we actually frequent here for happy hour, which is $2 domestic and rails and discounted apps, it's a great deal! I've also been on a late Saturday night and watched karaoke as well as live bands, now today I sit here having a glorious and inexpensive breakfast with a nice strong screwdriver and can say with confidence I've always had a good time here. Cheap drinks, good food, friendly service, and plenty to entertain, whether it be horseshoes, pool, darts, or live music. This place, without a doubt has a new regular with this TX transplant."}
{"text":"First time I have ever seen a roach crawl across the table as dinner was being eaten."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was dark and dingy, the food was high priced and lousy, and the service was horrid... I read the reviews prior to going and was a little nervous, but we had a coupon for $25.00 off... Hindsight being 20/20, I wish I would have headed others warnings."}
{"text":"only gp there if you have a coupon.  dark, dingy and old but breakfast is good and cheap!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to get together with friends for fun day Sunday starting off or happy hour Mimosa mornings. It's definitely no fancy place but it makes you feel like home. Met a lot of really great people here each time that I come. They got great breakfast for great prices."}
{"text":"OMG.  Save yourself the trip.  The filthiest, crappiest, dingiest, ugliest, most disgusting place I've ever entered.  And none of that would have bothered me if the food was good.  Everything is frozen and industrial, as I like to call it.  The \"vegetable\" soup had only one piece of celery in it.  The vegetables were MIA.  The menus had last years' food stains on them.  Couldn't find a clean one in the joint.  This place deserves minus 5 stars, but since that does not exist, I'm stuck with giving them the overrated 1 star review.  How anyone can like the food here, is beyond me."}
{"text":"Beyond bad. Sitting at the bar. No eye contact. Only people without a drink. Really? My medium 90/10 beef was bleeding and falling apart on the plate. After 30 minutes. It came back smelling of cigarettes. Just gross. Don't go. There is so much better than this in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Welp,  I'm back again.  It is.extremely hard to have an issue with this place.  Food is usually very good as far as bar food goes.  My girlfriend and I shared a dozen honey hot wings which were freakin delicious, a half dozen medium wings, and a bacon cheeseburger and a monster batch of fries.  Grand total - $17.84.  Had we been there on happy hour, it would've been $3 cheaper.  This place is an A+ in MY book."}
{"text":"I love this place.  For months after living here I drove by that huge sign wondering what the heck it was and finally decided to give it a shot - on a Friday night.  They have an all you can eat fish fry and the food is surprisingly delicious (their prices are so good I have to admit I was expecting low quality.)  They have live music Friday and Saturday nights which is always fun to watch (note - this is NOT the place to go for a quiet dinner if you want to chat the whole time.)  The staff is always great and treats you like family, even if you're not a regular.  I now go here all of the time for dinner and breakfast.  I grew up in Montana and this place reminds me of home!"}
{"text":"I honestly diidn't expect much but our waitress was great and the karaoke host made the night very enjoyable. Most importantly cheap drinks :)"}
{"text":"First time in for breakfast was great.  Came in tonight for their fish fry and got the other end of the spectrum.  Slow service. Wrong food order (potato skins WITHOUT bacon) is not overly complex. Fish arrived 10 minutes before the wife's dinner salad.  Sad, since I was hoping to share a stellar review. Not sure we'll be back.   PS.  do I get another helping of fish tonight?"}
{"text":"Really great time. Not super cute inside, but good band, fun dancing, and GREAT server, NATASHA. She made the night!"}
{"text":"I've been a couple times with my family. We love their fish and chips! And when they have their karaoke nights it's a fun place for the family to go and enjoy themselves. When you first arrive it's a little weird I have to admit because the decor is really random and it s dark inside. But it's like a country bar/restaurant so I wouldn't expect much. Over all we always have a good experience when we go."}
{"text":"Well it is really hard for me to not give this place four stars on the price alone...but the food was just okay and I don't want anyone to think otherwise.  The honey mustard wings were a bit undercooked and not really covered in much sauce.  The fried mushrooms were soggy.  My philly cheese steak was decent but could have used more provolone.    All of this food was less than a $20 so I can't really complain.  Just don't expect a gourmet steakhouse."}
{"text":"A great dance floor. And the house band Fri and Sat play lots of great country, along with some classic rock and blues. If you love to dance among an older crowd, or don't care about the ages ... come two-step with a great bunch of regulars!"}
{"text":"My family has a lot of great memories here and that has been over 42 years now.  So needles to say it has been around for a long time and that is nice to see places still here that have great memories.  The food was really good and the music was great (just need to turn the volume down a little).  Great place to go dancing.  The service was really good too!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews and the major consensus was that it was good food, but maybe dirty.  If this place was clean - it would not be the \"bar\" atmosphere that it is.  We went for our first time last week and have already been back.  The food is GREAT and the prices, well they are CHEAP.  We had a 34 ounce beer for $4.50.  We ordered 4 meals, 2 appetizers, 2 ice teas, and 2 beers for just over $50.  If you want clean and fancy - go pay for it with; I prefer good, cheap food."}
{"text":"This place has some really cheap deals.  The buidling is older and is falling apart a little, but it sort of adds to the divey old western feel of it.  The food is decent.  It's basically Denny's type food, or similar to what you would find in a truck stop.  It's nothing super special, but if you are looking for cheap eats, this is the place to go.  I would like to try and come here for karaoke some time."}
{"text":"Have been here many times before. Dining area is next to bar. Server is also bartender and owner cooks.   Place is old and rustic...is one of the early Phoenix  restaurants still operating... approximately 60 years.  Have had many breakfasts here. Burgers have been good. I sometimes think \"greasy spoon\" after breakfast. That is perhaps due to my choice of two fried eggs, home fries and bacon...but all good.  Prices have increased but what hasn't. Service was good. I will be back again."}
{"text":"I grew up not far from here at all - and I never went there.  I passed it.  I made fun of the signs.  I never went there.  Then one day - I got a coupon.  Buy one entree, get one free.  And we were going to be in the area.  So, we stopped.  The prices were so low that we actually felt too guilty to use the coupon.  Without the coupon the bill was only about $16 for dinner.  Prices were amazingly low.  Food was pretty darn good.  We were shocked.  We went back a week later.  It was just as good.  We forgot to use the coupon.  This time we'd gotten some extra things so it was $23.    I drove by this again the other day and remembered that I think I have another coupon.  One of these days I may have to take that coupon, order some great food and forget to use my coupon again.  By the way - big bar area.  We stayed out of that part, but if you're looking for a cowboy/country western dive bar - this could fit the bill.  And they can wrestle up some grub for ya while you're there."}
{"text":"It seems like the Wagon Yard has been around forever, yet we made our first visit there about a week ago.  The waitress (I didn't catch her name) took great care of us. She noticed immediately that what I was ordering was painfully diet/limited and she catered to me without blinking, made sure my salad didn't have croutons, etc. The food was very good with great specials."}
{"text":"This place is SO unique. Everyone is so friendly. A few regulars came up and introduced them to us and made us feel like home. The live band is INCREDIBLE on the weekends, it's crazy. There is definitely dancing, good (and strong) drinks here. They do close earlier but it was fine. It's such a fun place to just relax, grab a good drink and enjoy the band."}
{"text":"Great service and food!!!!!! Great  Friday night and Saturday!!! Friendly staff as well!"}
{"text":"Pocket friendly and I have to admit some of the best wings I've ever had. This place has a definite country feel. A couple of pool tables and dart stands for the gamers. Mostly has a restaurant atmosphere wit tables for dining. Don't dress up but definitely enjoy yourself and relax. Angela was my bartender and very friendly. I'll definitely be back with my family for some country music and food. Reminds me of Texas. My good ole' home state."}
{"text":"I'm not even sure where to begin.  This place is so weird!  They call themselves a saloon, and from the outside, that's exactly what it looked like.  They also have a sign out front that says no firearms allowed, but they have some weird iron sculptures of guns on the walls inside.  Strange.  Anyway, we were hungry after work, as usual, so we were looking around for something new and interesting.  After giving up on searching for something closer to our current location, we gave in and decided to give this place a shot.  After all, who can resist cheap food?  I had to stifle laughter when we walked in.  I don't know what it is, but this place gave me the giggles!  We stood at the hostess table for a few minutes before we were acknowledged and then a table was cleared for us.  Our drinks were brought out quickly and then we ordered.  Honey Mustard Chicken Wings and Fried Mushrooms for the both of us to share, and a Turkey and Bacon grilled sandwich for me.  Now, you will be sorely disappointed if you come here expecting any sort of creativity with food.  This is straight up generic as it comes food, but they at least do it right.  The chicken wings were piping hot, meaty, and had a pretty good flavor.  I'd probably order a bolder sauce next time.  The mushrooms were really strange.  They were fried, but their breading was soft, and not crispy at all.  I like the outsides to be crunchy, so they weren't my favorite, but I had plenty of ranch to dip them in and make things better.  Now, when my sandwich came out, I stared at it and was disappointed.  It just looked sad, especially with the straight from the bag wheat bread it was made with.  Let me tell ya, don't judge this book by it's cover.  My sandwich was packed with turkey and simply loaded with delightfully salty, crunchy bacon.  It was a really good sandwich, I'm just sad that I was too full to finish it!  The fries were, well, just fries.  I'll probably come back to this place sometime when we're in the area again.  The food is solid, the service is decent, and you cannot beat the prices.  I think we got a soda, 2 apps, and 2 sandwiches all for under 20 bucks."}
