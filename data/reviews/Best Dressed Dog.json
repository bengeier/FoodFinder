{"text":"we drove 17.3 miles for one of these critters.....mmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmm! I just wish they were open for breakfast, luckily I have to drive by here during my lunch hour three times a week, double up on the dogs and a bag of chips....yea baby, get some!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to update my review :) 

the owner e-mailed me and told me the dog was a customers, not his. it was another customer who wasn't watching his dog. so, that clears up that problem! the hot dogs are great. vienna beef and they do it chicago style which is my favorite when I am craving a hot dog. 

5 stars!"}
{"text":"Ordered both the chili dog and chili cheese fries. The chili was made with BBQ sauce--tasted nothing like chili.  Also, the french fries were translucent and chewy.  I asked if the fries were re-fried, the said no, but they offered to re-do the chili cheese fries.  I asked if they were going to be any different they said no.  So I declined.  I thew them out at the nearby trash can.  Waste of $8!"}
{"text":"Great service and the dogs are delicious. I love the Judd sauce that they put on everything. The fries are also amazing! I love to get the bacon chili fries and ask to add some pull pork. It's Heaven!!"}
{"text":"Well I wasn't going to try this food truck since Im not about hotdogs but was hoping they had the burritos they showed on the website, nope. I ended up ordering the Nacho BBQ fries with no Jalape√±os. Ingredients are as follows Pulled pork, cheese sauce, fries and red onions. The pulled Pork was good but I did get some pork that was hard prob overcooked pieces. The cheese sauce looked awful but tasted good, its not cheese whiz as i had feared. The fries where freshly fried as where good. Overall the food was decent, my only issue that I had was there was 2 prices 1 regular $7.75 2 large for $9.75 plus tip, You have to say ask the customer what size they want and don't charge the higher price without saying a word. I wont be back, I like to try all food trucks but its kind of crazy paying almost $10 for fries and pork ha ha My bad."}
