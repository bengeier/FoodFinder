{"text":"It feels really fake. The staff is wayyy too overly friendly so it comes off as condescending or feels like a kid's restaurant. The decor has no personality. It's like the creator of the McMansion opened a bar. They have a good beer selection, but the atmosphere is just not fun. I hope they can fix this."}
{"text":"I was here twice. Once during a fundraiser and the back bar was very busy. Another time to watch a pens game. My bartender was the best! So fun and my margarita was amazing. I think her name is Lauren. Will be returning for awesome haply hour deals and to see my girl again!"}
{"text":"This place had opened awhile back, and I've wanted to try it because the menu looked really good. I had been to the store side a couple times. It's expensive but convenient and for the size, good variety.   There was a private event happening so only the front of the restaurant was available. Glasses of wine are $4 all day so I ordered a moscato. The glass is really small, I wish I would've taken a picture. Whatever, I didn't come here for the wine; I came for the food. I ordered garlic Parmesan wings and the spinach dip. The wings were more like 'wing dings' and not worth the $7 simply for their size. I will say that they were flavorful and crispy. The spinach dip on the other hand was just not good at all. It was super thin and I continually added salt to help the flavor. I'm curious to see the back of the restaurant so I may venture back and try something different on the menu. Also, the speciality drink menu looked amazing."}
{"text":"I love the Thirsty Scholar! They always have great deals and the back area is very welcoming with the servers. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I can see it now.. I'm a first-year med student, need to take a break from the books and diseases, and find this bar - The Thirsty Scholar.   I can see myself posted up at the bar, with some notes and a draft beer. The friendly bartender makes just enough conversation to keep me feeling welcome, without interrupting my studying. This is the kind of bar I would be at if I went to UPitt.   I unfortunately just stopped by while waiting on a plane to fly back to Texas. I had the Philly and some buffalo chicken dip (which was awesome). The Philly wasn't great, but why get a Philly in Pitt? Idk, I just did.. ok?!  The only thing I could offer this spot as advice, would be to get some local beer on draft. I'm always looking local when visiting new cities and the bartender mentioned that there weren't many in their rotation. Oh well, it's a great stop if you're in town!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here and tried to use a valid Just Pay Half certificate and the management refused to accept it.  Gave me some bull about not being able to validate it.  I've bought dozens of Just Pay Half certificates and this is the first time that I had trouble with one which I believe was because they did not want to honor it.  Crappy way to treat new customers.  Also the food was not very good, probably a tick below average.  Just an FYI for others that may try to do the same."}
{"text":"I's named the \"Thirsty Scholar\" for a very good reason, lots of good beer and large drinks. Come for the alcohol and stay for the alcohol... The food is very unimpressive and not worth the money unless you're really drunk and need something to soak up the booze so you don't puke. I mean this in the best possible way since it is a collage bar.  I could go down the path of a culinary critique of a hugely disappointing meal but why... it suffices to say the Scholar could greatly benefit from someone in the kitchen with some, any actually, cooking experience."}
{"text":"I was visiting the doctors office in Oakland and had to wait for test results to be completed. My wife and I found Thirsty Scholar right across from the hospital. I had the BBQ pulled pork and my wife had the Cubano. The place was very clean and the staff was very friendly and service was really good. I had Jaz and she was always in top of my every need. We'll be sure to visit again when we visit the doctors again"}
{"text":"Free delivery from Postmates and quick delivery brought us to Thirsty Scholar. After decorating the tree, bar food was exactly what we needed and TS delivered.   We both ordered burgers and were pleased with the taste. Mine was a little bit smaller than my boyfriend's, but I did order mine well done while his was medium well. The most impressive part of the meal were the sides. I ordered cole slaw and my BF ordered onions rings. They both were HUGE portions. The slaw came in what was close to a soup cup and the onion rings could have passed as an appetizer. Both meals were around $10.   There are a million other places like this in the city, so nothing quite stands out. However, everything was good and I really have no complaints."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! My friends and I have been here a ton of times since it has opened, and we still love it! The owners and staff are all extremely friendly and go out of their way to make sure we are well taken care of, and the food is delicious (especially the wings and zucchini planks!) This place has turned into our go-to bar and restaurant in Oakland, and I would highly recommend it to everyone else!"}
{"text":"I have to give 3 stars. The food was good, the staff was friendly but it took 45 minutes to get our food. There was us, another table of 3 and a table of 1. (Table of 1 came in after us, got food before our table of 3). The server apologized because they had \"to go\" orders. To those who eat in Oakland who arent students, our time is as valuable and we are present in your facility. Those customers should be priority."}
{"text":"Slow service = Cold Food. 1st time this place was busy? It sure seemed like it. Terribly understaffed for a busy night with an concert going on at Peterson Event Center. They even had advertisements outside their door about the concert so they weren't caught off guard. Wings and onion rings were decent but both were cold, honestly probably sat for a while because our server looked to have way too many seated customers and was also helping at the bar. Beer selection was great. Probably a decent experience at a slow time. Need to hire more staff!"}
{"text":"This is the place to be. The drinks and food are good, obscenely well priced and the atmosphere is perfect for a fun time with friends. The staff treats you like family and you will want to come here every night!!  I personally recommend any of the bucket drinks, the Scholarita (to be shared!) And the pretzel bites.   They just added board games too!! What more could you want out of a night with your buds?"}
{"text":"After work wings for dinner are always a great option. I also had a ginger beer to wash it down. In the summer time it's sort of quiet and empty so it's the perfect place to go for relatively fast service. The bartender was friendly and chatty which is generally nice and the place was clean. The tv was on ESPN which is great for the guys trying to keep up with sports. As far as the wings go, you can order 6 of a kind with different flavors. I like to keep mine spicy with some citrus flavor. Dry rubs are the best! My coworkers love this place so I'll probably be back with them at some point."}
