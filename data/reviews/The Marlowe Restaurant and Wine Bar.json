{"text":"I had actually read the reviews before I went so my expectations were super low but they still managed to disappoint.  I waited so long for someone to take my drink order that I ended up ordering at the bar. The food was dropped off so quickly that we didn't have a chance to ask for cutlery (and no one noticed we didn't have any). We ended up taking it from another table. When the mains came, they didn't clear the appetizer plates. Then when the desserts came, they didn't remove ANY of the dinner or appetizer plates. Seriously? We also didn't get cutlery for dessert and had to once again pillage another table.  And don't even bother trying to get a glass of water...   Bottom line: mediocre food, terrible service."}
{"text":"Service is bad . Place is virtually empty and they have not taken our order. Been here 20 minutes. Bad bad bad. Menu is very limited"}
{"text":"We were here for valentines day dinner. The atmosphere had a winter wonderland feel with the snowflakes and the dim lighting but not in a cheesy way lol. There was a set menu for the night. I had the seared scallops, braise short ribs, and for dessert tiramisu. Unfortunately, the scallops were overcooked and the vegetables--accompanying the short ribs--were frozen and overcooked. I enjoyed the tiramisu, and the bread w/ olive oil and balsamic vinegar."}
{"text":"The waitress did not smile at all.  The manager came over at the end of the meal, and we were definitely not impressed.  Food was mediocre, and many of the dishes I wanted on the menu, were not available that evening..."}
{"text":"Went with a party of 4. Service was pretty good, but the food left a lot to be desired. We shared a Margarita pizza which was decent, but I had to send back my steak due to being fatty and rubbery. Ironic that the menu claimed their steaks may be unusually tender. Unusually lousy.  Ordered the ribs instead, which were supposed to be smoked, though I could not detect any smoke flavour. They were dried out in places, as if they'd been sitting under a heat lamp for a while. Not so great.  One of the guests ordered a portion of salmon, which was small and unremarkable. Everyone agreed the mashed potatoes were good, but it should be pretty tough to screw those up.  Never going back willingly."}
{"text":"Generally speaking,  food was pretty good.   Service was excellent as well.     I ordered the 10 oz New York steak medium rare and it was made exactly the way I ordered it.   I didn't find the peppercorn sauce to be too good. Just didn't taste right to me.   Potatoes and veggies were ok as well.  My friend offered the seafood pasta.   The portion was pretty big.   Looked pretty good as well.   I didn't get a chance to actually taste it. .. but smelled wonderful.   Price for pasta was reasonable. .. but found the price for the steak to be slightly higher than other places.   We than order two desserts.  The chocolate cake and the banana fritters.   Both were pretty good as well.   Slightly on the sweet side for the cake though.   All in all... not bad at all."}
{"text":"I went to The Marlowe with my co-workers as it is not far from my work place. I ordered a salad as a starter and a sirloin steak as the main course. The steak was very delicious and tender and exactly as I told them that I wanted it to be (well done). For dessert I ordered a crepe with vanilla ice which was also excellent.  The Marlowe is very tastefully decorated and has a very good service but the thing that I like the most is that they actually have food which tastes good. I would definitely go back to the Marlowe.  P.S. It's a little bit on the expensive side (with tip, taxes and alcohol you can easily end up paying 55-60$ per person for a full three course meal) but I guess it's worth it once in a while. )"}
{"text":"We regularly have our Friday adult or ladies night out here at Marlowe's but last night was quite different. When we are asking for a Girl's Night Out Friday menu, the server told us that it is no longer available (he apologized that he was just new, but sorry my dear, you looked like a PRO) I told him that it's impossible because we are just here last Friday and we ordered it and it's available. So I ask for the manager (who is not even aware of what is on their website and even a big CHALK BOARD sign at the entrance) about the Girl's Night Out Friday menu. As a manager, you should be aware of what you are offering to your customers, you should know your products otherwise it is FALSE ADVERTISING! And she even told us that she can erase it whenever she can! (WOW!!!) She was amazed when I showed her that it includes 4 bellini's and 4 appetizers for 50$ and even take my phone probably to verify with the other workers. So they have no choice of giving it on us but it now comes in small servings compared before. Their service is so slow, we ordered fries and asked for mayo but hello we almost finished the fries and yet the mayo is not yet on our table! And the highlight of our experience...they gave us a wrong bill! We know what we ate and as we will never take advantage of paying a much smaller bill. So I told the server that \"I think you gave us a wrong bill\" then he realized that it's wrong but it took him forever to bring us our REAL bill and he thank us for being honest but gave us a side comment that \" Definitely you will be having a good sleep tonight for paying the right bill and it's me who will be not having a good sleep\"... I will appreciate more if you will just say a simple THANK YOU  than saying any unnecessary comments which I think is quite rude and not proper especially for us who frequently hangs out at Marlowe's... HELLLOOO.... in the 1st place it's your fault of putting a wrong bill on us! It just so happen that I'm the type of customer who checks the bill and will never take advantage of you stupidity!  To the Marlowe's owners...try to hire somebody who knows and familiar with your menu's or what ever in your website so that they will not looked dumb or stupid when the customer asked or inquire something."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch today with a voucher off groupon for a 5-course meal. The restaurant was somewhat dark, with a more formal than casual ambiance. It was more packed than expected for a Thursday lunch, but had many seats nonetheless. Our waitress was friendly and our orders arrived quite quickly.  Overall, the food was good, but strayed a little from what I expected. The menu stated the second course would be a sorbet, yet what we recieved was more of a frozen lemonade or flavoured ice in a spoon, which was a bit disappointing. My entrée, listed as mushroom risotto, came with (Rigatoni?) pasta rather than rice. The David's tea, as stated, was in fact generic bagged tea. Despite these menu errors, the food as a whole was decently enjoyable.  The biggest error, however, was when the bill arrived. It charged us for an extra dish, due to the groupon being processed manually, which went unnoticed by the staff until it was pointed out by us.   2 stars for decent food and nice staff, alongside a bit of disappointment and a blunder. I may give this place another shot in the future."}
{"text":"Had a late mid-week dinner out on the patio with a couple of friends. We were told we were seated in the \"non-smoking\" section but another patron lit up a cigar. We had to asked the waiter to intervene, which he was quite reluctant to do, claiming that after 9pm smoking was permitted. Not sure how that would change based on time but we certainly weren't told that upon seating. He finally asked the patron to smoke in another area.  While the food tasted good, the portion sizes were pretty small and the margarita special definitely tasted watered-down. I can't remember our server's name but he was not overly friendly.   Visited July 2013"}
{"text":"Simple review. This place sucks. That is unless you like calamari that taste bbq wings and wings that taste like calamari. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Marlowe has been a stable fine dine establishment for a long time, and it consistently has a good flow of crowd that comes often. Its quite busy for the saturday we there. Lots of party tables!  Ordered two apps, two mains.  French Onion Soup: Once we tried better onion soup elsewhere, we wanted to try here and see how it compares. The soup here is not comparable. The soup is not that cheesy. The bread inside is soggy. The soup broth was not salty, so it was fine for that area.  Spinach Goat Cheese Dip with Nachos: This is decent, nothing too exciting. The first few bites seem a bit better, but after that you would just leave it aside for any hungry ppl that would want this.  Entrees: Eggplant Pamigiana with pasta. This eggplant was alright, more breaded than eggplant. I find the best eggplant parmigiana was in Niagara Falls pizzeria we had there.  Seafood Whisky Bake: Basically cheese sauce with a few small scallops, shrimps, and i recall one piece of lobster claw that was the size of my pinky. Not memorable.  Overall the experience of this place is nice. A bit dark for my liking. The food is hit and miss. Note: Watch out for their liquor tax that they add with their HST!"}
{"text":"Was there tonight with my wife. Meet at the door by to uneducated goons. They told me to remove my hat it wasn't allowed in the Restraunt. I did so and my wife got a table and then we were told there will be a cover charge. We have been there regularly and this never happened. I called to speak to the manager and he refused to talk on the phone. Business must be very good for them if they don't make it I won't be too upset. The surprising thing is I cont believe how many people put up with this kind of crap. Will never eat there again and attempt to tell lots of people."}
{"text":"The Marlowe fell far short of my expectations.   Fixed price menu at $45.00 came to $60.00 including taxes and mandatory 18% tip for large parties (excluding drinks). For 18%, I expect the server to:  -set my plate down in front of me, not hand it to me from across the table, over my dinner companion's head;  -pick up my plate when time to clear it, not ask me to pass it to him over my dinner companion's head;  -take my drink order after giving me a couple minutes with the menu, instead of waltzing away for half an hour;  -serve my dessert before the ice cream melts into a puddle;  -bring me a new dessert after I politely explain that my dessert is melted, instead of consulting with other serves for 10 minutes to decide if the soggy pile of goo on my plate should indeed be replaced.  There was nothing much I could do about the fixed price menu choice, as I was invited to a party that had been pre-organized, but from what I saw of the Prix-fix menu options, you'd be better off getting the $27.50 menu, it's not that much different.  I had the following from the $45.00-turned-$60.00 menu:  *Brushetta and olive sharing plate -of which 2 plates were set down at our table of 16, so there was not enough for all of us.  *Miixed greens, beet & feta salad - which was basically just a plain mixed greens salad with  a teaspoon of diced pickled beets and a tablespoon of crumbled feta  *Salmon - actually, this was tasty, the only thing that was done right the entire night. Friends chose the gnocci (tiny portion) or the beef medallion (dry).  -Hazlenut ice cream crepe - served melted, so I sent it back and asked for the cheesecake instead (see above). I got it only after my friends were already finished their desserts. The rest weren't offered the option to exchange their melted desserts, and were simply told to eat their soggy crepes and were brought fresh ice cream.  When dinner was over, the place turned into a club, and as we were seated next to the smoking patio, we had free air conditioning on a below-freezing winter's night.  I felt very, very, ripped off."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I ate here and this used to be one of my fav restaurants as they have amazing catches of the day. They have changed the place and menu quite a bit.   They seated us at one of the middle tables between the bar and dining room area. I'm pretty sure that the table for two as it was very crammed. The server was friendly and came to help us right away. We also got a free app courtesy of Yelp, and we ordered lobster and crab spring rolls ($14). It was delicious but definitely not worth the price as there were only 3 pieces. For mains, we order Ahi Tuna Salad (~$18) and seafood pasta ($~20). The presentation was very nice, however the salad portion was a bit small. Yet the pasta was very delicious and the portion was generous as well.  It was overall a good experience. Yet I wish the portions could be larger."}
{"text":"Service always good and staff are friendly and welcoming all the time. But one thing I felt disappointed from last visit was the tips stamp. Marlowe suggested pay tip on original price ($320 for 4) but not on the groupon price ($180 for 4). They even stamped the tip value on the receipt. $50 tip for 4 guests ??? Way too much although service and food were good. I'm a big fan of Marlowe even recommended friends about this restaurant but they noticed that tip stamp too. It was their 1st visit and felt they were forced to pay it even server told them it's just a recommended tip value."}
{"text":"Disaster.  Food was cold and the service worst.  Spend your hard earned money else where."}
{"text":"Went with a group for a birthday party.  The roast beef was flavourful as was the appetizer from their pre-set menu. Unfortunately our large group was split between a long table and a booth skirting the dance/dining area.  At 10:00pm everyone at the table were vacated and the tables taken away to be converted to a dance area. Even though the booths did not interfere with dancing, we were asked to vacate it as well (unless we got bottle service for the booth at $160).   The music, what I guess to be current top 40's and popular old school dance (Katy Perry, Madonna, et al)  was the order of the day.  The music however was ruined by an overbearing live drum accompaniment.  It caused more of an ear ache than anything.  I guess I got used to the drums and after a while it was okay (like after entering a smelly room...it still smells bad, but you get used to the smell).  It wasn't a bad experience.  It was memorable for a birthday but not memorable as a restaurant."}
{"text":"On March 23rd at 8 p.m., a group of about 15 people went to Marlowe for a birthday celebration. During the service, the waiter dropped a knife covered in butter on my girlfriend, he ignored people at the table several times. He then dropped a plate of ketchup on my brand new pants, and blamed me for moving my arm in his way. I requested a manager, who took at least 20 minutes to come over, despite it being relatively slow in the restaurant at the time. The manager finally came over, the events of the night were described, and the manager said he would \"take care of the drinks and look into the bill\". When the bills came, all of the drinks and food had been charged except for 2 drinks that they gave us. However, we could not drink because I was driving and I had already had 2 drinks. The bill also already factored in the tip. The manager was called over again and told that tip would not be paid. He said he would take it off the bill and disappeared. He was then seen doing shots at the bar with some girls instead of reprinting the bill without the tip as he had said he would. The waiter was then told the tip would not be paid, and he was very discouraged. Throughout the night other members of our party, including a very distressed birthday girl, also made their concerns known to the manager and waiter, but nothing was done."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I decided to dress up and go somewhere fun. This was my first time here and it was alright although the first impression wasn't great. We got there relatively late (around 9:30pm) and the hostesses greeted us with no smile. They had to go in to the dining room to check to see if there are tables available (really?). So it was a 5-10 minute wait (still without a smile like she hated her life). We were directed to a small table in a corner (small but cozy and intimate). I would have preferred a booth but it was busy so I don't mind. The lights were a little too dim. I had a very hard time reading my menu and I'm a 20 something! Our waitress was very nice and pleasant. But she was wearing knee high knitted socks. I don't understand why she'd wear that at a restaurant to work. Wear pants if you're too cold to wear a skirt. Anyway, it was just not right seeing that. Food was alright. Wasn't splendid but it was ok. Yes, the restaurant turns into a nightclub around 10pm and we found it quite difficult to talk. But by that time we had 2 bottles of wine and we were talking loudly to one another already so it made no difference. We would have gotten on the Dance floor if the crowd on it wasn't 50+. Yes, there was an older crowd there which is funny to watch but I won't get involved. the music was good though . At the end when we got the bill, I forgot to tell them (again) that I have a free appetizer from yelp so another girl (not our waitress) took my phone to show her manager, took another 10 minutes before coming back with my phone and a reprinted bill. They honoured the deal with no questions asked. Our waitress just disappeared on us! The least she can do is tell us that she'll be working at the nightclub side and this so and so will be here to help us. You know, just common sense and courtesy would be nice. Would i come again? Maybe."}
{"text":"The worst service I've ever had this past Saturday (August 30, 2014) and it wasn't my first time there. Never again will I waste my money at this establishment. Oh and not to mention the DJ is terrible... Pure disappointment."}
{"text":"We went as a group of 7and ordered the Marlowelicious $25 set dinner menu.  The soup is too thick.  After the soup, I am already half full.  The entrée meat is well cooked but the sauce is very thick.  Basically all 7 of us agreed that the chef must be a salt lover.  I don't know whether it is because we order the Marlowelicious menu but the food quality that I had experienced with this restaurant before is much better.  I do hope that the chef can control the food quality no matter what you order.  I may give it any try."}
{"text":"Dinner Dining Dancing that was advertised on the outside of their establishment.  Guess they wanted to inform everyone they're a supper club, but was dining necessary?  First time here (and most likely last time) as I usually don't venture up too far north of the city.  Attended a friend's birthday party on Saturday night and apparently lots of other parties happening that night as well, so it seemed like a very happening place.  Wines per glass varied from $10.50 to $19 and bottles from $25 and up.  I had ordered a bottle of red from Sonoma for $35 which I thought was a bargain considering the pricing of the wine list.  The waitress had to come back to confirm my order and when she finally appeared with my bottle I was disappointed it wasn't a full sized bottle but a half sized bottle.  Perhaps it was me not reading correctly,  but I really didn't see any indication of size except bottle written. Guess it was too good to be true a bottle for $35.  It was a decent bottle so I didn't mind too much, but it was definitely not worth the price as I got two glasses out of the bottle.  Since we had a large group we had opted for a prix fixe menu for $40 inclusive of tax and tips which was a great deal. Choice of two different salads or a soup for appetizers and choice of steak, fish (tilapia) or pasta for the mains. No desserts, but choice of tea or coffee included.  It was okay since we had brought our cupcakes and a cake for the birthday girl.   I had the caesar salad which was well presented and tastewise it was flavourful, not too zesty, and bacon topping cooked to a nice crisp.  For main dish, I had the steak which came with mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.    Upon making my first slice into my steak, I noticed it was not pink in colour which you would expect from a medium steak that I had requested.  It was definitely overcooked, but I was very hungry and took a bite.  After the second bite, I just couldn't stomach it and was hesitant to send the steak back since we already waited a significant time for the mains and I was hungry.  Plus it didn't help that my friends were teasing me to not  send my dish back or they'll spit in my food.  The server was nowhere in sight, so luckily for me the busboy was around and I told him my dilemma and requested a medium steak in exchange for the welldone steak on my plate.  By the time I got my steak, most of my friends were done their meal, and one friend didn't even get his main dish yet, so it was quite the wait.  My second steak was cooked exactly medium to my liking and the busboy followed up  and asked how it was.  No sign of our server anywhere and you would expect it was the server's responsibility to ask how the meal was regardless of the situation.   Service was a bit sporadic because it was quite busy that night, but when a diner has a wrong food order you would expect them to be more attentive ensuring that everything was okay.  One would expect with an establishment that specializes in prix fixe menu with Dinner Dining Dancing advertised, they would have their service down to perfection.   The DJ appeared around 10pm and the main dining area was cleared of tables and chairs for the dancing floor.  I've been to many supper clubs in Toronto in the past,  so know what the protocol is, but Marlowe just doesn't seem to know what they're doing.  Dancefloor was busy and the music varied from Spanish, R & B, hip hop and top 40s.....really a mix of everything. Half our group left after the cake cutting, but the remainder of the group stayed and tried to make the most of the night.  Considering the location, wine pricing and lack of service, I most likely won't go back.  The original Marlowe restaurant located on College Street in Little Italy many many years ago was great and they should have just stuck to the restaurant business."}
{"text":"Here visiting the fam. Cousin and I decided to go somewhere and have a drink or two on Saturday. I randomly picked this spot, because the music was bumping. Little did I know, there's a charge to get in, 10$ cover. Walked in and in the back.... Ta da! A lil dance floor! I'm screaming \" yes!!!!\" in my mind, cause I'm the type that needs to move after some drinks.  I gotta say, pretty chill place with the d j and his partner on the drums.   I'll come back again , on my next visit."}
{"text":"I've been to this place for dinner and also for drinks.  It is tastefully decorated, however I found the menu lacked ample selection. I ordered the salmon which was overdone and on the dry side.  The place does offer good music and a dance floor. I would go back for drinks and skip the dinner."}
{"text":"GOOD food and ok prices.  Service was a bit slow but it is Christmas and the place was jammed.  Was SHOCKED at the mark-up on wine ... Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc costs $19.95 at the LCBO .. Cost of a glass at the restaurant $17.00. Will not go back because of that!"}
{"text":"Food was good. But was very hard to get the waitress attention. Our orders took way too long to come. I saw others who ordered after me get all their dishes. Our small two person table was horrible and just tiny. Saw other couples get the empty booth, that was empty when I came in."}
{"text":"I went here for a friend's birthday party and I'm glad that was the reason, cause this place was a waste of money. My close friend and I went together and he ordered the wings and I the calamari. I don't know how you can screw up something as simple as fried calamari but they did it. It was so greasy and tasted like mush. Some bits were cold, I bet they just frozen calamari for convenience.  The wings, what can I say..They were overcooked and dry. When our waiter came by and asked if we wanted any mains or entrees we politely declined and told everyone else we had a bite to eat before we came. The service was alright until it came to the cheque. It took them forever to split the bill even though it was requested at the start. Nothing to go back for, spend your money else where."}
{"text":"Got a mushroom pizza. Not much to say, thin crust, extremely tasty sauce, cheese and toppings. I'd get it again! Way better than Boston pizza or any other pizza chain restaurant."}
{"text":"A mixed bag.  The good, the bad and the ugly:  The good:  The food! Ordered a mix of dishes. Burger, pasta, fish etc... All were surprisingly excellent! Decent portions. Keep in mind the prices match the quality of the food, but I think that is fair. The bad: A minor gripe, but it was difficult to see in the restaurant due to the lack of lighting. I'm leaning on the side of forgiveness considering this place doubles as a club at night. The Ugly: Terrible customer service. From the mildly annoyed hostess who didn't seem interested in taking us to our table (odd especially since the restaurant was empty and...you know...its her only job) to the bartender who kept taking selfies of herself throughout our meal (must be a part time Insta model, good to have goals), the service was not at all customer focused. Everyone was disinterested. There was no room for accommodation. Any request made me feel like like I was intruding on the staff."}
{"text":"The Marlowe is a mixed bag of a place. The decor is an attempt at high class that doesn't really make it. The food is pretty mid range but the staff is very attentive and the drinks are done well. The won't selection is reasonable but not as extensive as one would expect. It's a place best enjoyed on a quiet night for drinks rather than a weekend."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Marlowe's today.  Beet Salad and wine.  Salad was maybe a bit pricey for the serving size ($15) but nice flavours and combination.    Service was excellent - our server was very nice, stayed on top of the service as appropriate even as it got a bit busier and also gave us space when she saw us talking (didnt interrupt).  I will go back for sure to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place.  Food and service were at McDonald's level, with a mish mash of things on the menu, all equally tasteless.  Expensive for what you get.  The only decent thing is the decor.  If you're in the area go to Alice Fazooli's instead (next door).  Both food and service are definitely better (even though this place is trying to position itself as something higher end than Fazooli's)."}
{"text":"Not the best experience! Service is ok but food is not that tasty. Even crepes are not good. Dancing is ok."}
{"text":"I went there for my birthday with my family.  There was no service. The  waiter spilled my husband's beer all over the bench.  Luckily my little nephew went to washroom otherwise it would spilled on him. Our entree came before our appetizer after reminding our waiter about our appetizer.  The ribs and tiger shrimp was awful.  The steak was too dry though we ordered medium rare.  We find the table  next to us was getting much service.  We have to ask a few times to speak to our waiter.  I would not recommend restaurant.  Overpriced and no service."}
{"text":"My fellow yelpers at all cost avoid this place for food. I don't think I have ever been to a place with worst quality and service than this place and unfortunately for me I have given them a number of chances. Came in with a group of 10 people they forgot some of out appetizers got us incorrect entrees after making us wait an hr for them, steak was completely raw, baked potato was hard, the food bland, and they didn't even bother to make it up to us when we complained. Last time I came in the chicken was raw.  I went to a different restaurant the next night and the difference was magical. Good was much better and when we said that we liked everything except the pasta without is even asking they comped it.  This place is horrible and I really hope that some this better opens up in that area."}
{"text":"If i could give zero stars i would.  This was the worst possible service I have ever received.   Saturday night, 11pm, 7 girls, bday party....we had called to book a table and were not informed of the $10 a person cover charge.  The bouncers and greeting staff at the main entrance of about 6 people were not welcoming at all.  It was so loud we could barely ask about of table reservation. Once seated we waited well over 15 minutes before our drink order was taken and then did not receive our drinks until 30 minutes after that even after asking a manager and at the bar what was taking so long.  When the drinks finally did arrive 2 of the 7 drinks were wrong and the waiter kept trying to convince them to take the wrong drinks.  He finally came back with the correct 2 drinks 5 minutes later.  We complained to the waiter about the extremely poor, slow service on our friends bday night out and he said he was sorry then came back saying his manager was comping us a round of shots on the house which ok cool but then said it had to be vodka.  A girl in our party is very allergic to vodka so we asked for tequila and were told no and that he would mix something up.  Our waiter came back 15 minutes later with what we were told was sourpuss.  It was just plain cranberry juice with NO alcohol!  So we tracked down a manager again and complained again to which we were told we would get out cover back...yea right.   WORST SERVICE OF MY LIFE!"}
{"text":"Well I was browsing through the events page, trying to find a place to take my bestfriend out for dinner since it was her birthday and saw that Vivian made an event for Thursday ladies night! Lucky for me, I clicked \"I'm in\" and made my way to Richmond hill. I took the ETR like a baller and made it there in 20 minutes from Brampton. I arrived on time since I had reservations for 7:30pm and I was seated immediately. The inside of this restaurant seemed very hip and the red lighting makes the place look pretty cool. My best friend  and I ordered some nice cocktails, I forgot what she had but I got the blueberry Collins. Since Thursday is half price tapas at 8:30pm, we were to hungry to wait so we started off with the spinach & goat cheese dip. When it arrived, it was too goaty for me lol my best friend loved it. As soon as we got our drinks we asked for 2oz, for both of our drinks. When we took our first sip it seemed like they didn't even put any liquor. I told the server and she went immediately to check what happened and she came back apologetic and explained that she punched it wrong in the system. I'm glad at least she was honest, after all, she did mention that she just started, so we cut her some slack. In return she gave a extra drink on the house for her error, how nice of her! After blabbering about for a hour it was 8:30pm and we started off with steak surrounded by corn salsa, delicious! We also grabbed the wine platter, one of the best platters I've ever had! It had Parmesan and Brie with sweetened walnuts with dried cranberries.. Yum! After that goodness we ordered the Brie filled with Apple and cranberry puff pastry. That was delicious as well but I was Brie'd out!! After all that I had no room for anymore food. The only problem was it was hard to find our server most of the night and she was quite forgetful with our drinks. Also it was said it was ladies night, I only saw one group of girls and mainly couples so that kind of killed the \"ladies night\" vibe. Otherwise a great experience and I would come here definitely with friends or on a date :)"}
{"text":"Came here for a nice dinner with my fiancé tonight - super unimpressed. The hostess was snappy and short with us saying we only had 1 hour and 15 minutes to eat even though the restaurant was half empty - sure, no problem.  After that, our waitress was okay, but didn't offer us refills on drinks or pay us much attention. There was a specific waiter that kept eyeing us down our entire meal making us feel very uncomfortable as though he wanted us to leave. Had to wave down a waiter for ketchup for my fries who was very rude. Never coming back!"}
{"text":"Before coming here, I knew not to have very high expectations. I know this from previous experiences that this place is not so great but I showed up for a birthday.  We had a large group and were seated at two long tables that were unfortunately separately to accommodate the large crowd.  The nice thing about it was that we were behind the DJ booth and in the back of the restaurant so it was more private and spacious for everyone to mix and mingle.  I ordered the Bruschetta, which was really delicious in my opinion, but could've used a little less tomatoes.  (Just a heads up, if you check in you get a free appetizer, thanks to Yelp).  For my main, I decided to go with the Lamb Burger - House made Lamb Patty, Pickled Red Onion, House Tzatziki, Crisp Lettuce and Crumbled Feta Cheese on a Toasted Brioche Bun with a side of salad.  I'd say that the burger was mediocre, nothing special and it only tasted OK.  Let's just say I didn't end up eating the whole thing.  I only ate half of it and left the rest.  Other than the not so great food, we had a really great waiter who was very accommodating and engaging. The other guy that was assisting him in serving the food, unfortunately, was not so great.  He got all the orders mixed up and was extremely disorganized.  One guy from our group wasn't allowed to have bacon on his pizza and he got pizza with bacon on it so they had to send it back to the kitchen to remake it.  All of us were halfway through dinner already before he even started eating. The DJ at the restaurant wasn't very good, he literally just sat there and played Top 40's music.  I would've much rather listened to the radio.  The people on the dance floor are creepy old dudes that stand around creepily watch girls dance.  Overall, good company and a fun night out but I don't recommend the food, crowd, ambiance or music.. Next!"}
{"text":"Do not get the sangria in a pitcher!!!  The food was delicious and so filling. The lobster grilled cheese had tons of lobster in it, and the wild mushroom rigatoni was cooked really well. Both dishes in a good sized portion.  The sangria we ordered was the worst sangria I've ever had. It was extremely watered down and tasted like nothing. It had no wine flavour and basically tasted like watered juice. Nobody at our table finished one glass.  A nice atmosphere on the patio and inside as well."}
{"text":"Wednesday nights @ Marlowe -Latin Dancing  Since I frequent this establishment practically on a weekly basis, (my weekly \"Havana Night\") I thought it's only fair that I write about it. The Marlowe is a beautiful restaurant and lounge with a charming dining room complete with white table cloths and dimmed lights. The bar area is equally as beautiful as it features leather booths for groups or you can sit at the bar to chat it up with the bartenders.   I've honestly only been here for desserts, on a Sunday night, but it was still a remarkable experience, because it's where I met my lover: wine sorbet. The wine sorbet comes in 3 flavors: Rosé, Riesling and Cabernet Sauvignon, and since I had a Riesling earlier that evening, I chose the Cab. (I hate Rosé! Yuck!). The Cab sorbet was amazing: ice cold and full of flavor; you can definitely taste the wine. I also had the fried banana fritter, it was also very good: deep fried banana dusted with cinnamon and sugar. It was very delightful because I love bananas.  Wait, I just remembered, I had a Cesar here. What can I say about a Cesar? I'd never had a bad one and you can't really mess it up. The one I had was very fresh tasting, spicy (by request) and it came with a celery stick. YUM. My friends seem to enjoy the beers here, they have quite the selection on tap, but of course, it's no Biermarket. I would join my beer-drinking salsa friends, but I don't like beer and the only beer I wouldn't mind drinking is the Mill Street Organic, which they don't have. Too bad, so sad.   Anyways, back to my main purpose of writing this review: Wednesday nights -Latin Dancing. It starts at 9:30PM on the dance floor (in the middle of the dining area) and it's mainly for beginners. One of my salsa partners doesn't like the classes, he finds them boring and not helpful because the instructor doesn't teach us to dance with a partner, but teaches us the steps on their own. Some people (like my dance instructor) calls Marlowe's salsa lessons \"aerobics\" because of his teaching style.   After the dance lessons, the floor opens up and it gets flooded immediately by couples that are about  twice my age and older,  but can totally out dance you. Everyone on the dance floor is like a pro, and it's also crowded, so it may be intimidating for someone who has very limited Latin dancing experience in a crowded club setting.  The \"pros\" may be pros, but they really need to work on dancing \"small\" because they're all over the place, totally disregarding their environment, mainly the other dancers around them.  I myself have been shoved, kicked, and stepped on countless times by guys and their partners because the guys don't know and don't care to dance smaller and they also don't know where to put the girl. As a girl who hates being confined to small places, I started dancing with my left elbow up (so more ballroom than Latin) and out so people would stop bumping into me. (And if they do bump into me, they'll get jabbed by my bony elbow! Now who says I don't play contact sports? The dance floor is just as bad as the hockey rink, especially if 90% are pros.)  One thing I love about Wednesday nights at Marlowe's is the music. They play a variety of music via a DJ booth and I really appreciate the DJ spinning authentic Latin music (en Español)  throughout the night. The restaurant also have a small stage at the corner of the dance floor where a Latin band plays LIVE as you dance. I love LIVE music and the Latin band is SO talented! Oh yea, the reason why I don't call it \"Salsa, \" because the instructor and the band don't just focus on Salsa, they also teach and play music for the bachetta and merengue.  Marlowe's on Wednesdays is just one of the many themed nights. For more details of their themed nights, check their website: http://www.themarlowe.ca/richmondhill/index.php  I would definitely love to go back to Marlowe on another day just to try their other themed nights."}
{"text":"The \"Marlowe bruschetta\" contained soft black kalamata olives and plum tomato chunks on an olive oil brushed white baguette which was very tasty compared to most bruschettas being served on just plain bread.  The spinach and goat cheese dip was pretty good but I think it was a little too thick.   It contained a lot of ingredients in it like cream cheese, parmesan cheese, goat cheese, mozzarella cheese, artichokes, jalapeños, and roasted red peppers.  The nacho chips were just average crispy chips."}
{"text":"Wednesdays are Salsa nights Fridays are Ladies nights  If you live near this area and don't feel like going all the way downtown then you should check this place out. Spacey dancefloor. Great DJ and even live band. Mature crowd. There are plenty of booths if you prefer to sit down and have a bite."}
{"text":"Just a few bites from our full review -  \"Marlowe is fairly generic from the outside, it does not have the cache of occupying a unique building or being in a cool neighborhood. We would have normally skipped a spot like that, but very happy we did not on this occasion.\" \"The undisputed champion of our dinner was the Australian Lamb Shank. Marinated, slow braised meat with roasted red mashed potatoes, root vegetables in combination with Barista Valley Shiraz Dani and raisin pepper relish were to write a separate post about. \""}
{"text":"Long overdue review (about three years too late). $99/person for New Years Eve for the 2011 NYE bash.  It was basically a 3 course prix-fixe menu with dancing afterwards.  I remember having the beef wellington and it was delicious.  Nice crispy outside, medium rare on the inside, just amazing.    So why 3 stars instead of 4? Because I found the crowd a bit too uptight and \"douchey\".  Oh well.  Would I visit again? Sure, why not...food was decent."}
{"text":"I'm surprised for a 2.5 star restaurant, the food was really decent! It wasn't too salty or sweet and the service was great! Came on a Monday evening and it was pretty quiet.  I got the truffle rigatoni with chicken. Delicious cream sauce with mushrooms and parmesan. The chicken soaks up all the sauce and the pasta is perfectly al dente. It's a big portion too.  The chocolate mousse bomb was surprisingly not too sweet! It was rich and dense with a dark chocolate coating and a thin cake layer at the bottom. It wasn't sweet nor bitter. It was so good!   Though the creme brulee was a bit more liquidy than custard, and I didn't know it came with berries on top  The bread and butter are fresh-ish, soft.  The appetizer platter was okay; typical breaded shrimp, bruschetta and hot goat cheese dip that was salty.  The truffle aged cheddar aranchini was okay too; nice presentation, breaded risotto cheese balls on tomato sauce"}
{"text":"If you've ever been to east beaver creek on a Thursday evening, you know that every restaurant is busy busy.  When I walked into Marlowe to meet a friend...it was dead.  That should have been clue #1...  I would never choose to go to Marlowe, b/c I've heard it isn't worth the trip, but my friend suggested it, so I went along and kept my thoughts to myself.  My friend arrived before me.  When I walked in, the girl pointed and said, 'over there, third booth on the left'.  So, great service off the bat (not).  We ordered wine and then shortly after, ordered our mains.  We waited quite some time for the food, not a long time really, but about 45 second before we got our food, they brought us some bread.  Why not bring the bread after the drinks?  This was a second indication that the service is weak.    I ordered a steak and truffle fries.  Friend ordered the swiss chicken.  I was not given a steak knife, so i had to wait about 5 minutes until I could flag someone down.  My steak was like a leather boot, truly unenjoyable.  The fries were just OK.  Better than frozen, but still just average.    And, that's really all I have to say.  The food is sub-par at best.  The place is dead, the service is not terrible, but it isn't acceptable either.  kwim?  I will not go back."}
{"text":"A few days ago went for drinks on the terrace. They had a list of special on one page of the menu that were about $2.00 off. My wife ordered a Mai Tai and I ordered a Mojito made with \"premium\" booze. The drinks were fine although the Mojito was on the weak side. We also shared and order of fries which were meh.......  The service was excellent. With regards to female pulchritude, one of our wait staff excelled in that regard and was dressed in appropriately revealing bar little black oufit. Another one of the wait staff was also dressed in a little black outfit, but it definitely was not \"sized\" properly, nor should that construction have been worn. It certainly did not do what this person thought it would...but I digress....  When we received the bill, the Mojito was not discounted. When I pointed out to our waitress that it was on the list of the day, she said she could see that and would speak to the manager. She returned to tell us that it should not have been there (on a printed brochure!). I told her that she should talk to her manager again and they discounted the price appropriately. Its good as the prices are a tinge high.  Its a nice terrace, but I hate having to argue that is obvious. I love terraces so I may occasionally come again."}
{"text":"Ambience is nice, service is standard, food is standard, prices are high. Very poor value for the food and service you are getting. They do however have a very nice wine selection and full bar. That is all they have to offer. If you're looking to drink and just munch on some food, this place is great. If you're looking to dine, I would recommend elsewhere."}
{"text":"Place has gotten a little better since the last time I was here.....a few years ago. They have expanded their outdoor patio which is a PLUS for the summer, as well there's some added parking spaces which was well needed for the area.   Anyhow our gang of three decided to come here for some drinks after 10pm on a Saturday night, Marlowe transitions from a restaurant-lounge into a club at 9:30.  Cover is $10 and they start charging after 9pm. I've got to say that being a fellow YELPER has its perks, and upon checking-in our party received a free appetizer of choice, so we went for their spinach dip. One word, YUM! served with lightly salted chips, the cheese was decadent! and complimented our drinks. overall rating for the spinach dip was about 4/5."}
{"text":"I guess this is a good compromise for people who live in Markham or Richmond Hill and don't want to go downtown for that downtown vibe.   A few friends and I came here for drinks only.  We sat at the bar and ordered.  It took a while b/c there seemed to be only one bartender.  Now this was around 5:30pm on a weekday - happy hour time.  The place didn't start getting packed until about 6:30pm, but there was still one bartender.  Ordering took awhile, then of course I was charged incorrectly when I got my bill.  I've heard the vibe at night is much better, but to be honest I would rather just drive the 15 min downtown and enjoy myself.  The plus is that they do have a space in the back if you want to host a semi private party - it isn't completely cut off from the restaurant so not 100% private, but at least you can have a larger group in the back.   There is plenty of tables./booths and the bar is actually quite large so this restaurant can hold a lot of people."}
{"text":"Not sure where to start... upon arriving to the restaurant, we were greeted by one of the cooks in a hairnet. He was acting as the host, and instructed the waitress where to sit us. We were seated in the same section as to where a table of 13 was throwing a birthday party. I'm not sure why... the restaurant was quite large and spacious, with a few diners scattered here and there.  The food didn't taste right either. Mussels and oysters didn't taste fresh. Caesar salad dressing tasted sour and linguine sauce was super bland. Each course to our meals also arrived at every 30 minute interval, after you're done with the previous dish. My mom got really tired of listening to clubbing music, while we waited for our food. Food was also delivered by the chefs. Not sure why, because the restaurant wasn't short staffed. Our waitress pretty much neglected us the entire evening. Service was so slow, and she never bothered checking up on us. As soon I was able to grab her attention, I asked for our coffee, cakes to go and the bill. She came back with the bill and the cakes, but didn't realize until the next day, she packed the wrong cakes! Coffee also took forever, because she had already forgotten about it. I asked for cream and sugar, and she came back with milk and sugar. I assured her it's ok, we don't want the cream anymore, because it would've been another long wait. She got pretty scary..... and said she'll bring the cream, even though I repeatedly I said I didn't want it anymore.   It was a truly odd dining experience from beginning to end.  I recommend this place if you enjoy loud music, have a lot of time and need a place to chill. You'll be dining here for a minimum of 2 hours, waiting for service."}
{"text":"Went there for an event with a lrage group that was expected. It's a nice place and the food is alright, but it's horribly understaffed. The staff that is there try their best, but I blame the management. Food took forever to come and they ran out of bread while we were waiting for our meal. Seriously? I understand that the place becomes a nightclub at night and they probably make a killing because of that, but if you want to be a respectable restaurant during the day, get your act together."}
{"text":"Came here back in December with a group of co-workers for dinner.  Immediately upon being seated, we were informed that the very table we were sitting at had a reservation for 8:30.  Since our reservation was at 6, we didn't think that would be a problem.  However, half our co-workers were stuck in the ridiculous traffic that day and did not even make it to the restaurant until 7.  While we were waiting, the servers brought around opened bottled water and asked if we wanted water.  Not knowing that it was going to be charged (they also did not say that it was going to be charged when asking), we said yes.  The food was decent, but nothing spectacular. Service was standard, took forever to flag down the waitress so we could order.  She even ended up skipping over a couple people and we had to flag her back again.  However, the reason for my 1-star review is the fact that at the end of our meal, when we got the bills, we got slapped with a $30 dollar water bill, despite the bottles NOT being left at the table after being poured - meaning they could have either filled the bottles back up with tap water and/or gave the water we were paying for to other tables without our knowledge.  The aforementioned reservation at 8:30 ended up not showing up, which we were suspicious of in the first place.  Also, the tip was included in the separate bills, which the waitress proceeded to round our totals up to the nearest dollar when we asked her to add $3 per person to each of our bills due to the preposterous water bill."}
{"text":"They are pretty inconsistent here. A few times I had excellent service and the food was amazing, and then there's other times when it's the total opposite. So im giving it a humble three stars because the food is quite delicious. I really like when they gave a special menu for the seasons or just the catch of the day. They make fantastic sauces to accompany their dishes and the seafood has yet to really disappoint.   Service wise, sometimes we got welcomed right away, others, I had to go get someone to tell them we were at the door. It's a little frustrating because the restaurant is pretty well lit.... Though they do have that dimming atmosphere. But at the door, it's so much darker. Kind of puts you off when you walk in cause then it makes it look super fancy when inside, it's more if an upper scale casual dining restaurant.   Some servers remember to check up on you after a minute or two of giving you time to review the menu, others tend to just stand there and stare at you and over load you with information until you order. Some just say they'll be back and don't return until twenty minutes later. Fine by me though cause the seats are comfortable and you are slowing down your own turnover.    Would I return? Probably... Cause the food is pretty good... But the service really needs work"}
{"text":"I recommend the lobster grilled cheese. It's got some kind of truffle aioli thing going on. Super tasty. Also, the side of gravy (which I requested with my fries) was well above average.  Ahi tuna salad was like $18.95 so we expected a dinner-sized portion. Not so. It was fairly dainty, however also very tasty. Apparently they just launched a new menu (November 2014)...and surprisingly they have a wide selection of fresh catches, if you're a fish fan. But they ain't cheap.  Service was mixed. Nobody came to check on us after serving the meal which I really hate, because we needed stuff (ketchup etc) and had to wait far too long before someone finally walked by.  Also, it gets super loud in here....but I guess that's not a bad thing if you enjoy a lively atmosphere.  Food tip: Thursdays after 8pm their \"tapas\" menu is half price.  Drink tip: If you like vodka martinis, order them \"without vermouth\". Otherwise you're getting a nearly 50:50 vodka/vermouth ratio and far less buzz for your buck :)"}
{"text":"I went to this place on Friday ... The place was good with great music ... The light and stage was amazing ... If you know how to dance salsa make sure to come on wed as I did but I am not good in salsa ...  It is nice to have place close by than going all the way to downtown ... I have not tried the food here but my plan is to get booth next time and give it a try."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now for corporate events... So not paying myself.  This time ordered the paella. Ok... Not too bad at all. On my paralla scale of 1 - 10 id give it a 6. Service and attention to our group... Id give it a 7. Value for money maybe a 7.  All in all, the fell and ambience is about a 7.  So, having said that; looking at other dishea, my friends loved the lamb. They loved the duck and they loved the tuna. One friend was not pleased eith is over cooked burger.  Most felt the quantity was a bit light for the dollar but overall was a tasty experience.  I found the drink prices about average to slightly high, but not too watered down or acceptable.  The feel of the place is nice as is the overall enjoyment and ease of being able to talk over the crowds or noise.  Totally worth a trip if your in the area or for a corporate get together, but i am sure there is better out there, but in this area not too much."}
{"text":"Went here with a date.  Service was horrible first of all.  The bus boys were way better than my server.  My date arrived first and got a table , but the hostess was clueless and said for me to go look to see her (also there was a whole 3 ppl tables here.... how do you not know that there is a girl by herself at at table for 2 is waiting) I think we saw our server 3 times.  Always waiting to order a drink, a meal, get the bill.  Also there was a fruit fly in my date's drink (which honestly..sometimes that does happen.)  No complaint about that, but we didn't see our server for 15 minutes, and had to tell a bus boy. who got a drink right away.  The waitress eventually did come by and joked oh you don't like protein in your drink.  Food was good.  Nothing I would rave about, but it was solid.  But a 2 star was the service was horrible.  BTW people got bread here???? how come I didn't get bread??  Pros: nice look Good drink selection  Cons: Service.  You can have the best tasting food in the world, but if your service is awful, it is not worth it.   I honestly didn't feel like tipping a minimum 15%.  (yes i did still, but decent service i give 20, and great service 25%)  No bread!!"}
{"text":"When you want to do date night on a weeknight without totally breaking the bank, Marlowe can do it for you.   Always wanted to come by here, having \"Wine Bar\"  in the name. It was a decent experience. You get nicely cooked food, friendly servers, in a contemporary atmosphere with some modern touches. It's not ultra fine dining, but it's not a dive either. Placed perfectly in the middle.   Atmosphere  There is several pleasant looking sections in the dining room and even an outdoor patio for when weather is friendly. Good mix of fun wall art and accents make it a comfortable place to be with multiple TV's around if you want to keep an eye on the game.   Food   Date and I both had a 4 course meal with a Groupon. Beet salad was great. Good mix of greens, veg and got cheese with candied pecans which made it.   The beef carpacio was also very delicious and appetizing. Loved having the lamb shank main course which was juicy, spicy and very meaty.   Desert was a cheesecake and brownie and both are sweet, filling ways to top off what should've been a filling and delicious meal.   Overall a 3.5 carried by both atmosphere and food quality, dragged down by value as it is still a tad pricey"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner and I have to say-food was great. The service-EXTREMELY POOR. I have to knock off stars for this one...because at one point I feared that our server must have suffered some kind of medical ailment to prevent him from showing up! The dinner was with a groupon which I must say was a great deal-four courses plus wine...and the food was quite delicious. Dessert was disappointing. Will not return for the purposes of a dinner..perhaps for a drink and lounge atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just had my sons Barmitzvah brunch at the Marlowes (Sunday 11am).   The food was fantastic, the service was beyond expectation and at $29 per person for the premium menu, the value was good.   The event was seamless and the staff amazing. I am so happy I chose this place.   My son loved the food so much, he even asked to take left overs home...... And he never asks to take food home.!!!!  I can be rather fussy with my reviews, but this place didn't disappoint in anyway.   Highly recommended for a private function!!!  Returned as a couple a few months after our event. While the food was good, the prices were very high (about $70 a person) and the service was average. While nice, I don't. Feel the place warrants a premium..... I prefer the Keg overall."}
{"text":"I felt compelled to write this review because some of the other reviews are so negative, specifically about their service.    I met an old friend for dinner here last night at her suggestion and to be honest, I was dreading it based on the reviews.   The reviews about the service couldn't be further apart from my experience.  The place was jammed due to many holiday parties but we wanted for nothing during our time there.   The timing of food arrival was perfect, we didn't wait long for plates to be cleared, our water glasses were continuously topped up, quality checks were perfect in quantity and timing.    I have a high standard for service and our waitress killed it last night.     The food is pretty average, kind of exactly what you would expect from this type of place.  We shared bruschetta which was massive and very good although the bread could have slightly more toasted.  I particularly enjoyed the addition of kalamata olives.  We also shared the ceasar salad which could have used more garlic but was fresh and not over dressed.   The mains were the worst of the meal.  My friend has the seafood linguini. The pasta was well cooked but the seafood was over cooked.   I had the Jumbalaya, which was spicy as requested but not good.  All the proteins were way over cooked as was the rice and veg.    I find their menu pretty limited and wouldn't go back for mains but would go back for apps.     They had a decent wine by the glass selection."}
{"text":"Marlowe's has an electic fusion menu going from pizza to burgers to a good fish variety as well as aged red meat choices. They also have anextensive wine list.The ambiance & music is very hip. Loved the place it has a sexiness to it. The staff is extremely nice & caring. The food was well presented and good. I really liked the vibe of this place.  I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Someone introduced me here and I am so glad they did! I love it here for date night. The atmosphere is really great and I never have any complaints about the service or food. I do recommend calling in for reservations on a Friday/Saturday night and coming early for parking.   Pros: - Food: I haven't made my way through the menu yet, but I love both of the pastas listed below. So good!  - Service: The servers are so nice and polite. They are very helpful in terms of asking for recommendations so feel free to ask should you not know what you want to eat.  - Consistency: My food is always consistent amongst the times that I've been here which is great.  - Decor: The restaurant decor is so nice. It has a great vibe to it! Great place for date night or a night out with friends.   Cons: - Parking: It may seem like there is tons of parking in the lot, but with the amount of restaurants in the area it is very hard to find parking during dinner time. Be sure to leave a little earlier before dinner to get parking.   Foods I like: - Wild Mushroom Chicken Rigatoni - Butternut Squash Ravioli  - Spinach & Goat Cheese Dip   Overall, I definitely plan on coming back. I plan to try new things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Totally wasn't planning on coming here but was pretty much forced here because Touro Churrascaria was too busy to take more customers and the wait time for a table of two was over an hour. Marlowe was pretty busy themselves at about 1:00pm on a Thursday but they didn't turn us away and found us a nice booth seat. One thing I really hate about this plaza is the parking. Literally had to circle around for about 25 minutes to find a spot. People were making their own spots and parking on curbs and even handicap spots. So frustrating and its on a normal Thursday afternoon at around 1:00pm. I know there are a lot of office workers around during this time but still.  Anyway, now that I have finish complaining; on to the actual review.  Meal came with complementary bread. No butter for some reason but still tasted good.  For appetizer got the lobster poutine $13.95 - didn't really like the taste at first but it grew on me and there was a healthy portion of lobster meat which made me happy.  Prime rib dip with mash potato $15.95 - looked small but by the time I finished the complementary bread and lobster poutine and this sandwich I was quite full. Good portion of meat. The dip was pretty good but definitely had better dip sauce before.   Lunch special sandwich and soup of the day $12.95 - basically a BBQ sauce sliced beef sandwich and creme of mushroom soup. BBQ sauce was a bit sweet and once again a good portion of meat. The soup was really good but got a bit boring towards the end. Maybe I was feeling too full.  Even though it was really busy the service was pretty efficient and very friendly."}
{"text":"What a sh!t hole!!! The service was atrocious, the steak was like leather, and the background music was garbage.  I will NEVER go back to this craphole. AND the washroom smelled like piss!"}
{"text":"Surprised to read such negative reviews of this place! I ordered the salmon with goat cheese salad. My meal was pleasant and cooked how I like it. Sure, the menu seems a little over priced but I had a decent experience! Huge menu selection and in a busy plaza area of Restos! Nice ambiance! Didn't drink wine but a pretty good selection!"}
{"text":"Wished I had checked first to grab the free appetizer.  Planned to go to Izakaya tonight but there hear wasn't working so wandered over to Marlowe. Marlowe said they were full on reservations, but if we were okay eating in a two hour time slot then they could accommodate us.  We had been here before, but I have to say that tonight the service was extremely attentive. I'm pretty sure the dinner rolls were from Ace as we sometimes get them at home for a treat. Had some drinks, mussels, jambalaya (bit over seasoned maybe) and yummy Swiss chicken. Ended with tea.  Solid dinner."}
{"text":"I've been to Marlowe quite a few times for drinks but this last Friday I went there with some colleagues for dinner for the first time and all I have to say is I will have to work very had to gain their trust back in making dinner recommendations. Yikes. The service was ok but the food was terrible to say the least. I'm not going to comment on the food that everyone else ordered tho they were all disappointed. but my seafood pasta ... Well didn't think you could that go that wrong with a Seafood pasta but they did. The seafood the over cooked, scallops, shrimp and mussels hard and rubbery, over cooked they not edible.  I took two bites and stopped. Our server noticed and asked and I was honest. He did over another pasta, but I had to stop I there. I just couldn't risk it. I refused and asked him to forget about it. Sorry Marlowe you gotta work on the food! Never eating here again and I have redeem myself with my friends."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner recently with my partner after receiving a gift card for writing an honest review.  I still would rate this place a 4/5 for hosting events; however, dinner here would be a 2/5 (which is why I give this place a 3/5). I ordered a steak with vegetables--vegetables were good, but the steak was chewy and it was supposed to be a New York steak....unfortunately, it was very bland too.  My partner ordered the pizza which was decent but nothing special.  The crust was thin which was great, but there wasn't a lot of ingredients except a whole lot of cheese.  Overall, although I'd probably consider hosting an event here again for a large group; however, I probably wouldn't return for a normal dinner."}
{"text":"I wish there was a negative star to give  We went there because It was last resort  We were not welcomed properly  Given attitude when we wanted to change spots in an empty restaurant  Then when giving our fish taste and experience at four seasons in Santa Barbara the waitress tried to tell us that THE FOUR SEASONS GAVE US BAD FISH!  Like seriously !!!! You are comparing ur restaurant with four seasons ! Then she started pretty much arguing with my guest !  We ordered about 200$ and she had nerve to point out the tip section on the interac! Though we left her 40$ I will never ever come back this place has seriously gone down ! Oh next day my friend did get food poisoning !!!!  Never again !"}
{"text":"We often go there on Wed night for dinner and salsa dancing. The food is not bad, though I certainly like their appetizers better than entrees. I like their spinakopita and scallops. The service is slow, so be prepared to wait a long time - bad if you are hungry. They are a bit pushy with reordering wine..."}
{"text":"For some odd reason, my company has decided to host few corporate events at this venue. Being part of the social committee, I took part in the planning and execution of the events. I was very unimpressed with this place. The manager is a very unprofessional individual who was not only non-responsive and, frankly, outwardly pervie (he was totally hitting on my colleague at the event, who was married and felt very uncomfortable). My other colleague told me that she took her parents to the place for a bday celebration. They were seated at 9pm. The food was served around 9:30pm and at that time they were informed that they need to be done by 10pm as the restaurant will be turning into a dance club. I think it would a professional courtesy for the servers to inform this BEFORE placing order and/or at the time of reservation. I'd personally never wanna go back."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of this place. I was really excited about coming here because my friend enjoyed this place and we usually have the same taste. However, I came here with my parents and none of us really enjoyed our meal.  Portions aside, (since this restaurant is geared towards quality instead of quantity), the food was not impressive or delicious. I remember everything thing being salty and just okay. It wasn't so bad that I'll refuse to eat it but it's too ordinary for that price range.  The service here was good though and I did enjoy the sangria so I decided to gave this restaurant a 3 instead of a 2 stars."}
{"text":"We were a group of 7 with reservations at 7:30pm, and because of the slowest/poorest service that you could imagine, we weren't finished and out the door until 10:45pm.  The food was above average so at least that is a positive. 3.5 stars   As far as the service.....zero stars. Anytime we wanted to order/get a refill of water it was our job to find someone and flag them down.  We literally had to beg someone to take our entree orders, and get on our hands and knees for someone to take our dessert order.  At the very least the entree orders came out promptly, but our desserts took 25 minutes to arrive at our table.  The last straw was when I asked for the manager to let him be aware of the situation, and after waiting 15 minutes he did not bother to come and the waiter apologized for the poor service.  I was shocked at the indifference.  To top it all off, because the meal took so long we were stuck eating our dessert during blaring music that they turn on at 10pm and the place turns into a night club.  Needless to say I will not be going back and I will most definitely not recommending this establishment to anyone."}
{"text":"The Marlowe Restaurant and Wine Bar is as it's name implies a restaurant and wine bar but also a dance club as well.  We had a social gathering just tonight with family and friends and the atmosphere started as a restaurant feel but became more like a dance club as the dance floor opened up and music got loud and the place became more vibrant.  In terms of food it was good but didn't really stand out as we chose from a set menu.  Service was good but little slow as staff had to juggle between all the orders.  For those of you who enjoy a vibrant restaurant/bar/club, The Marlowe definitely fits the bill.    3/5."}
{"text":"Have been going to Marlowe for years and am sad to say that the quality of food and service has really gone downhill recently (within the past year or so). Not sure what happened? Used to be a 5* establishment, with wicked gourmet food and drinks and stellar mature service. There seems to be much more focus on the dance floor and turning the restaurant into more of a club in the evenings, rather than a classy dining establishment. I used to be a server, and I am very patient when I notice poor service. However the server I had on my most recent visit was immature, messed up our order a bunch of times, kept forgetting things, and did not come back to check up on us at all. The food used to be top notch, but now it is barely on par with Kelsey's. For the price, I expect more - better food and better service. I have been a fan of this place for many years and so keep hoping that if I go back again things will have improved, but I have not seen this at all. I hope they pull their socks up and bring Marlowe back to its high quality roots!"}
{"text":"So this my wife and myself's 2nd attempt at Marlowe.  The first attempt ended after just 15 minuets of us sitting and looking around for a server to place a drink order.  Needless to say we walked and decided to try elsewhere.  Well today beckoned round 2.  Things i must say started off very promising.  We were sat immediately and within 3-5 minutes we had a server come over and take our drink order (2 glasses of red wine, a pepsi and glass of water.)  2 minuets later our drinks arrived sans the water... forshadowing... possibly... we placed our dinner orders off the groupon menu and waited.  The food started rolling out.... now, i must say, the food was tasty.  We got into our 2nd course but still no water... and at this point i ask the waitress and she had the \"oh shit... i completely forgot\" look and off she went to grab it.  By this time my wife's pepsi was finished and she mentioned she would grab another... you can probably guess what happened... now i'm not a hard person to please and i try not to complain unless absolutely necessary but the service here has much to be desired.  The food is actually quite good but is hard pressed to make up for the front of house staff who in my opinion are failing the restaurant. If they got their stuff together, this would be an awesome place to bring a date.... now to top it all off, to have the server who forgot multiple items, who i will not out on social media write on the bill what the tip should be and she feels she deserves for our meal is out of line and in poor taste...  Management really needs to step in.  Customers would tip what they feel the server deserves.  Unfortunately the cooks end up suffering for the lack of skill by their servers."}
{"text":"Marlowe was terrible..I got there and they refused to let us in because we were not on guest list. The door man was rude and told us that you have to be on guest list to get in....I have been to Marlowes many times and I have never been on guest list..I gave it a bad review based on one experience which was pretty but the other times weren't much better"}
{"text":"Mediocrity would be generous. Poor management, poor service, poor food. I wouldn't return but it seems their event nights are keeping them afloat."}
{"text":"This was the second try at this restaurant. The food wasn't amazing but it wasn't horrible.   The first time I went we started with the bacon wrapped scallops and I had a seafood risotto and he had the steak. We were with three other couples and it took FOREVER for the waitress to come around. After waiting at least 30 mins we finally ordered, then another 30 minutes our food came. My risotto was missing flavour and you can't really mess up a steak.   The second time was last night for my friends birthday. Tony the waiter was FANTASTIC he made everything for the chaotic group work. The food though again was just mediocre. Nothing memorable to be honest, everything just lacked flavour.   THEN it turns into a lounge. I must say, if your trying to get the club vibe from downtown you definitely got it. The washrooms were SO DISGUSTING. That was even before while we were having dinner. No toilet paper, apparently women in York region don't understand how to use the facilities correctly and no one I assumed wanted to clean it.   This is be the last time I come here."}
{"text":"fancy smancy.... who cares.. We had a group of 30 people.  Book for 7pm, was not seated til 8:30pm.  Almost like they did that on purpose so we would purchase alcohol from them.  And it wasn't like there wasn't any room... they didn't bother to put out the tables on the dance floor for us for 1 and half hours... so we had to stand... and starve.  Some food was passed to us while we were waiting, but very little for the 30+ people waiting.  Food was outrageous... the taste was ok, nothing special.  The worst thing is the portion size... after standing for over an hour, the size of the soup, chicken, and cake was ridiculous small.  What is this, food for kids... even medieval times gave bigger portions.  Too add insult to injury, the plates and bowls were huge for the food was tiny in the middle... reminds me of Gordan Ramsey doing critiques of restaurants....  Do not attend if your hungry.   Marlowe... more like MarNOT."}
{"text":"Great looking place inside and service was great, however, the food was not worth the price.  Out of 16 of us, I believe 2 had a good experience and they both ordered steak."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times for dinner in the past few years and I recalled the food here was alright but nothing too memorable.  However, our dinner here a week ago was pretty good, definitely better than before.  The place was pretty packed on a Friday night.  I heard a staff mentioned that a lot of people were there with Groupons that were expiring soon which might explain why the place was packed.  I never got the Groupon for this place as I still had an Entertainment book coupon to use here which was a saving of $15.  I know that it's hard to believe that someone still buys the Entertainment book, but it still has some awesome deals.  We ordered 3 mains - Shrimp Linguini at $17, Seafood Linguini at $24 and Baby Back Ribs at $28.    Everything was delicious and generous portion of shrimp and seafood on the pasta dishes.  The seafood included lots of mussels, clams, shrimp and squid.  As for the ribs, the portion was huge and the meat was very tasty and tender.  All in all, it was a great dinner.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First off I want to say that I went with a group the started with 13 and ballooned up to 20. That being said, they could not handle 20 people. The waiter tried his best but he was just not up to the task at hand.   The dancing was good and if you like crowded, then you'll enjoy. Good music all around but the drummer did like one of his instruments a bit too much.   The food itself is a subset of the regular menu with large groups. It was very bland all around. Everyone in my group said the same thing, needs more flavor."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place as I live in Mississauga and my friend lives in Richmond Hill. We wanted to go to a place where we could talk and have a nice dinner and Marlowe delivered! My first impresssion was it was clean with an 'upscale vibe' to it .  I ordered an arugula an walnut salad, and baked chicken with potatoes and the meal was delicious. Our waitress was very good too.  The menu was extensive with lots of things to choose from as well. It's very rare that I would travel 45 min to come back to a restaurant, but I will definitely come back here ;o)! If you are looking for a nice place with great food, service and atmosphere, I would totally recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is like a 1/2 and 1/2 mix of the Keg and Moxies.  It was fine for lunch but nothing overwhelming to write home about.  Eat at the bar or high tables for lunch and get 10% off."}
{"text":"I am only able to speak for the meal that I just had there, I was invited for a business meeting and saw the yelp reviews and thought this was going to be bad. But I had the Cajun Greek Salad and it was excellent.  The chicken was spiced really nicely and was just nice and warm and not dry at all.  The salad was great and I did nibble on one roll that was fabulous.  The other person had a penne pasta that he said was excellent.  Overall I have to give this 4 stars.  Service was great but the place was pretty empty."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was average. What I didn't like about this restaurant was that the waitresses will ask if you want certain things with your meal making it sound like it came with the meal but really it's extra cost for something like sauce. She asked if we wanted sauce and sautéed mushrooms to go with the steak we ordered, making it sound like it came with the steak, but it was an extra $9 for something that didn't really add value to the steak. She never said it was extra or anything, just added it to our bill for us. Didn't like that, don't like when restaurants aren't completely clear with charges and bait their customers to pay extra."}
{"text":"It used to be THE SPOT! But that era is long gone! Marlowe used to be a great spot back in the days, especially in the mid 2000s where it was a smoke and wine bar! Where you used to be handed a menu of different low to high-end cigars to company your fine wine and appetizers! This was a great add-on, I believe it used to be on Wednesdays or Tuesdays. But once it turned more into a night club on weekends, the crowd it attracted changed from all professionals and businessmen to something else. For some reason, it always does not seem or feel clean, whether it's cutlery, plates' set, booths or just the overall look and feel of the place. The \"restaurant\" part of Marlowe doesn't have much to offer, although it has a wide menu selection, it doesn't provide anything unique in terms of taste, nothing really stands out in my opinion. Service is below average, and no one seems to care, they had lost their will and hope for one reason or another!"}
{"text":"This review of The Marlowe is based on the Savour York Region Special $25 dinner menu.  3 Courses for $25 sounded like a good deal? But if you comes with an empty stomach, you would leave hungry unless you stuff yourself with the dinner rolls. The dinner rolls were warm and really tasty.  Appetizers: Caesar Salad/Organic Green - I could not believe how small they are...... I hope it is not their regular order - fresh and crispy though  Mains: Short Ribs Braised in Red Wine/Baked Tilapia/Crusted with Lobster and Crab Meat - Short Ribs was rich and tender  - Tilapia was so so... I was a little disappointed because as fish is their speciality??  Dessert: Crepes with Ice Cream/Chocolate Mousse - I would not have order them again... remind me of some home made desserts  Side order: Mussels in Tomato Broth ($10.99) - That's was the best food of the night. The broth was nicely flavoured and mussels were quite fresh!  Would I go back? Not Really?   For a drink? Maybe? Definitely not for their food!"}
{"text":"The food I ordered was good. I would come again for the roast beef sandwich."}
{"text":"This restaurant made me laugh out loud. Everything was horrible from the food to the staff. I literally don't have one good thing to say about this restaurant. If I could give it 0 stars I would. I went on a Friday night for a friends birthday dinner as soon as I arrived the hostess informed me that the reservation was wrong and that I had to \"go figure it out\" because they needed to know. Only to find out that she had looked up the wrong reservation.   We were seated and ready to order around 8:30. The waiter came back several times to ask people again what they had ordered. Ordering drinks was impossible because he couldn't even get our dinner orders right. The food didn't show up until after 10:30 and had I been there on any other occasion I would have left. I ordered Oysters as my app and the Ahi Tuna Salad as my main. My oysters didn't come out when everyone else's appetizers came so I called the waiter and he informed me that the half dozen oysters I ordered are an entree and would be coming out with my salad entree, and that I should clarify next time as to what I want first. I couldn't help but laugh and tell him to please bring my 6 oyster \"entree\" to the table.   The oysters were small and had lots of shell in them. The tuna salad wasn't a salad at all. It was more like burnt flavourless tuna chunks and coleslaw. I also ordered shrimp with the salad that were too salty to eat.   I had 3 gin and tonics through the evening and they were made with variations of tap water Sprite and tonic water. The staff at the bar were just as rude and unprofessional as everyone else.    I'm pretty sure the waiter ended up pocketing a bunch of the cash we paid him because none of our bills were correct and he didn't bother adjusting them in the system. Just don't eat here there's no point. There are plenty of other decent restaurants in the same parking lot. I suggest avoiding this one at all costs!"}
{"text":"When we first walked in, the 'welcoming' staff wasn't very welcome. We had to wait 15 minutes even though we had the reservation and we were a large group. Nobody was sitting at that booth prior to us. Not sure why we had to wait. When we were seated, our server gave us the menus, asked if we wanted water, what we wanted to drink and walked away. 15 minutes later, he came to ask if we wanted to order food. Didn't tell us that we had to pay for water ($7 per bottle) and kept brining us water. What happened to pitcher of water from tap? The main thing is that he failed to inform us that water is not free. Next thing we noticed was dirty glasses. I mean come on. You cannot check your dishes before you put them on the table?!?!? Poor service, rude waiter(s), poor management, and a very disappointing evening. It was my friend's birthday and we couldn't even enjoy it. One positive is that the food was good.   Will not come back. I love my downtown restaurants & service much better. I tip really well based on service. And the service I get downtown I would tip well over $50. This restaurant got $0."}
{"text":"Yeah.. Not too happy about this place. A group of us of 15 people went out for a birthday dinner on Saturday and I was not happy about the food. We ordered our appetizers and the waiter informed us that they will be sent out with our meals, not before... Which is completely pointless because the whole point is to get it BEFORE our meals.. But anyways. The bruchetta was absolutely perfect, definitely 5 stars for that.. However, myself and a friend ordered their $36 New York Steak on the menu, cooked Medium Rare. When we got our food, it was delicious. After the FIRST bite, the waiter asked us how it tasted. Of course we said it was good because it was the first bite - the waiter did not come by again until everyone was finished. Reaching half way into my steak I took a bite and I almost ran to the bathroom to be sick - The entire middle of my steak was so raw it looked like it had just been taken out of the package and slapped on my plate. I have never had a steak cooked so poorly in my life. When we mentioned this to our waiter, he said he spoke to the manager and said the ONLY thing he could do was give us buy one get one half off appetizers for NEXT TIME.. No thank you sir. That steak ruined my entire evening as I felt sick and did not want another one because I was completely turned off. If there are larger parties, they should not focus on cooking the food QUICK and TERRIBLE, but rather cook the food that everyone orders perfectly how it is expected to be cooked... Not happy with this place at all."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Marlowe with a group of friends around the time that they opened, so we had our choice of seats. I suggest calling ahead on a Sunday since their hours aren't posted on their website. They were very accommodating, since my friends had a 1-year old. The wait staff was also very patient, since we spent some time catching up instead of deciding what to order. They were also very attentive at refilling our waters.  We decided to start with the spinach and goat cheese dip (free appetizer with Yelp check-in deal). I also ordered the seafood and whiskey bake for myself. The dip was very tasty, just what I had expected it to taste like. Creamy from the cream cheese. Fresh nacho chips. The seafood and whiskey bake was just okay. I thought that the main dish was a little too salty. The dish itself is quite small. I thought that the use of scallops was not a great idea, since it continues to cook inside the dish.  We paid with gift cards. Unfortunately they can't partially deduct amounts from gift cards. You either use the entire gift card balance or lose it. You also can't use some of the gift card balance to pay for tip."}
{"text":"This place is horrible! We are never coming back. I was meeting 3 of my girlfriends at 9:30 last night. I arrived at about 9:40 and was told that the kitchen is closing at 10 and that I only had 5 minutes to order from the menu. My other girlfriend arrived at 9:45 and they gave her the after 10 short menu, refused to offer her the full menu because they had already turned all the ovens off for the night. My 3rd girlfriend arrived at 9:50 and the front doors were locked. She called us and the manager opened the door for her. When I asked our server what time they closed she said 11. (Google said 12pm). She said google was wrong, straight faced and really didn't seem to care. When we asked the Manager he said 12. When my girlfriend came in there was another couple behind her who were surprised the doors were locked at 9:50 and left. When we told the manager he said oh sometimes the doors get stuck. WTF?? THEY WERE LOCKED! The Manager nor the staff seemed to want to be there and was rushing us to leave. We didn't even order drinks, we finished our food and debated for our bill to be discounted for the next 10 minutes. Oh and the best part, watching our server take shots behind the bar. We asked the Manager what the owners name was and he asked \"what is this concerning\"? I then was looking for the candid camera ... are we being punked??? Is this for real?? He said he is not allowed to give out his name. Really unbelievable .. I hope he reads this and realizes that he's lost business and on one of their slower nights. Not even an apology from him. Took him another 10 minutes to prepare our bill and I brought my dish to the bar to have it wrapped because ya know all the rushing then we get zero service! When we finally left we went to Jack Astor's next door, thank heavens for Mark, the Manager, we told him what happened and he showered us with love and attention. Super fantastic place to be and 1000% customer service and how you want to enjoy your evening. He apologized for our experience next door and gave us free apps! Can you believe that??? Great karma is coming to this Jack Astor's location and not so good karma will definitely show at Marlowes. I can't even give a Negative Zero star rating for Marlowes, otherwise I would. Stay away from this place, seems staff has attitude and it stems from the top management."}
{"text":"Went to Marlowe on a Saturday night for a 30th birthday party. The host ordered a pre fix menu which had a lot of options. I got the tilapia Neptune...tasted amazing! There wasn't much appetizer selection in their prefix but the menu itself does have a few good options. Desserts were also good, however the chocolate lava cake did not have much \"lava\", maybe a teaspoon. Our server was excellent and very knowledgable. My suggestion to the management would be when taking reservations is to inform the guests about the live DJ that would be there and that after 10 pm there would be a cost to the guests. A few of the hosts friends came after dinner not realizing they would have to pay. Also, price fixed menu should always offer at least one glass of wine! :-) just saying!"}
{"text":"Went for a business dinner meeting and had great service. Food was fresh and sampler appetizer very delicious.  I had the broiled tilapia with Garlic mash and veggies.  Tilapia portion was very small for the cost of dish. Mash was not fluffy and only received 1 half piece of red pepper,  for cost of the dish, portion was too small and quality not up to par.  The ladies washroom was slippery along with floor leading to it and I almost slipped and fell.  Washroom odour was not pleasant, it's like there was an issue with toilets earlier."}
