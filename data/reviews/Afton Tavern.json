{"text":"We've eaten at this place many times and even attended a company dinner here.  We love the ribs which is a big surprise since it is not their specialty but we get them every time.  Their cookie skillet & fondue dessert are great!!!"}
{"text":"Nice local place.  Food is neither spectacular nor is it horrible.  An overall decent local place to grab a bite.  Typical tavern bar fair."}
{"text":"Afton Tavern is a fun and lively place with well-priced food and drinks. The Blue Cheese & Bacon Burger is a great burger for anyone near the Charlotte Area. Featuring blue cheese crumbles, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and onion. The blue cheese pairs very well with the crispy bacon and juicy beef. Overall, this was a very good burger, but a better bun or juicier beef patty may put it in another league."}
{"text":"I understand why this place has mixed reviews. The staff is friendly and the place has a lovely outdoor patio; however the food is mediocre at best. 

I went for lunch. We started with the boom boom shrimp as an appetizer. You can get it grilled or breaded. Per our server's recommendation we got it breaded. It was tasty; however it has more sauce than I personally care for. It made the breading a bit soggy. 

For the entree, we both tried the turkey burger. I choose the saut√©ed zucchini, squash and onions as my side. My friend ordered a side of the mac n cheese. The burger was decent and the bun was soft and warm. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't good enough to order again. The zucchini was bland. I only ate half of it. The mac n cheese was very disappointing. Our waitress highly recommended it. It tasted like Kraft Mac n Cheese. I have nothing against Kraft, but that's not what I expect from a restaurant that brags about homemade Mac n Cheese. We sent it back and got sweet potato fries instead. The fries were good. 

I probably wouldn't order another meal here. On my last visit I met a friend for martinis and appetizers. They offer half -priced appetizers after 9 pm. We sat on the patio, which has flat screen tvs and a beautiful fire place. That was a good experience, our meal today was not."}
{"text":"3rd and last visit.  Food is consistently bad. Overcooked dry steak. Worn out place. Never again."}
{"text":"Wish I could give  it less than one because it deserves nothing more. 4 visits  first2  were acceptable, but the last 2 visits were worse than bad. Visit 3 had a salad with salmon and the fish was raw. Told them to take it back ,they offered to redo. However I waited took long to get the first salad by now with the wait and raw fish my appetite was  gone. Waitress apologized , but it was not her fault. She said it would come off the bill well duh of course. I at least expected manager to come to the table. Well that never happened. Figured I would give the. Another chance and next visit asked for an outside table. Waited a reasonable amount of time and then my alert rang. They begin to take us inside. Stated ask for an outside table and the perspective. That tried to seat us said someone must have made a mistake. Well she took our name down. Duh. Told them never mind, walked right by manager, and he heard what we said. Guess he could care less. Will not waste my time or money  on such  a poorly ran establishment ."}
{"text":"My sole purpose to come here is for oysters and cookie skillet. They are very good!!!
Fresh oysters and the cookie skillet is to die for... I recommend both."}
{"text":"I love Afton Tavern!  The food is great, especially the barbecued ribs, the wait staff are all friendly, the managers are always visible and cater to customers.  Best thing that ever happened to Afton Village in Concord!  They are involved in the community too; have a special teachers' night, Rotary clubs meet here, special events, kids nights.  I live in this area of Concord and we go here all the time!  Love it, love it, love it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I like to go here because the Nachos and BBQ Chicken Flatbread are killer.  The nachos with chili and chicken are awesome.  The afton salad with candied pecans is also a favorite.  

They have been running a special of 1/2 price appetizers after 9pm and so my family of 5 can go on weekends or we go with friends have a few drinks and apps.  We really like it here.

Don't forget to leave room for the cookie skillet."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always has great service, managers who care, and food is amazing. Love their crab cakes and jambalaya. Almost every table around me always gets a cookie skillet to end their meal. They have a chocolate chip one but my favorite is the butterscotch oatmeal cookie skillet. Delicious! They also make almost everything there including dressings, sauces, and soups. If you live in the area and don't at least try this place out... You're missing out!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to check Afton Tavern out for quite a while. We had a group of 5 attend. The waitress wasn't very talkative but service was just fine. We had the bacon cheese fries as appetizers and they were fantastic. I want with the chicken tacos (can't remember the actual name) and they were fantastic. My gf had the shrimp version of my tacos and they were good as well, even when heated up in the microwave later. No one else complained about their meal and we had a great time. I will definitely be going back.

Apparently they have $8 pitchers of draft been on Thursday night. I am hoping to be hitting that up soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered cheese broccoli soup, but was brought vegetable soup cause they were out. Ordered steak medium but got one very rare. Mashed potatoes clumped and cold. Corn bread hard and possibly over cooked or old. Other than that, the wine and water were ok. 

Not the experience expected!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and got in with no wait on Father's Day! Food was awesome! The manager comped our apps before we even realized the wait time for the first course. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"A great location and great outside seating, but unfortunately the food is not great. Once again a small, local restaurant where it seems like the chef never tastes the food he/she lets leave the kitchen. They would be better creating a smaller menu with fresher options. And please purchase tomatoes that are not hard and lack flavor."}
{"text":"Totally just created this account to write this review about Afton Tavern..we made a reservation on a Thursday for Saturday for a party of 14 in which they would have it set up for us at 7 Sat...we checked in and they claimed they couldn't find our reservation it's kind of strange how a party of 14 was lost, anyways they put us on a wait list and we waited for an hour cause we really wanted to try this place but after the hour and sum minutes were up we asked how much longer they said another hour or so and they claimed they NEVER take reservation in which I saw the reservation layout of the evening CLEARLY in front of them so after they lied to our faces we left and this is what brought me to write this review. Idk if it's poor hosting or what it is but never have I experienced such incompetence in a restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was 7/10, however, if you enjoy staring at each other for 30 minutes waiting for shrimp tacos then this is the place for you. Also whoever is in charge of the music needs to be fired. One time we were here and they had 2007 rap on and today they had some strange jazz from the 1920's"}
{"text":"Not great, wouldn't recommend, go to Afton pub and pizza right around the corner...way better, nicer management, and better staff. All around alright, used to be much better for less."}
{"text":"I like this place. The service usually is hit or miss. The last few times I've come in however there has been a strong bleach smell. Almost like I'm walking into a pool. Not sure why but it's not something you wanna smell while eating."}
{"text":"I visited Afton Tavern a couple weeks ago on a Monday night.  There were 8 of us, 4 adults and 4 kids.  It was a kids eat free night and they had a movie playing that the kids could watch while they ate.  I was expecting it to be pretty busy, but it didn't appear to be overly busy.  There were no long lines waiting to get in but tables were turning over and there weren't many empty seats.

Let's start with the good.  The food was decent - about what I would expect from a \"tavern\".  I had the buffalo chicken philly and wasn't disappointed.  It was tasty and came with sweet potato fries.  It was also $3 margarita night and it was a basic margarita - nothing fancy, but nothing wrong with it.  My daughter had a hot dog and fries and it was a good sized hot dog for a kids meal.  The rest of the group had no complaints about their food.  

Our server came to our table and introduced himself to us by writing his name backwards and upside down on the disposable paper table cloth - that was the highlight of his service.  Several times he told us he was new and apparently was absent on training day.  He was slow, unfamiliar with the menu, inattentive, and apathetic.  After waiting 7-8 minutes after being seated he showed up and asked about our drinks.  We weren't given a drink menu so he had to go get that.  When we finally ordered drinks, the four adults all ordered something from the bar plus a water.  We received the bar drinks, but had to ask about the waters - which were difficult to get refilled.  The kids meals did arrive before the adults - which I like, because kids generally eat slower and have a small appetite for waiting.  The entrees came out next and the two people whose meal came with a salad/soup didn't get those.  He blamed the kitchen for not bringing those out, while I suspect it was his responsibility to handle those.  There were other things missing from our meals and again it was \"their\" fault.  Once we finished our meal it was again a waiting period to get our check and then check out.  If not for the automatic gratuity charged to large parties, he would not have received much of a tip.

One of the guys in our party is a frequent patron and assured us this was an anomaly.  He spoke with the manager to let him know about Hans and got the impression that the manager wasn't surprised to hear the feedback.  We weren't looking for a free meal, but more to let them know that he's not cutting it.

I would go back as there was nothing wrong with the quality of the food, but if I got another server with a similar experience it would be the last time."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this establishment multiple times over the last 5 years. I live in the Afton Area and can walk to The Tavern. The Food is normally done pretty well and they have Kids night on Mondays which is awesome. The issue I have is the service 80% of the time SUCKS! They have some of the worst service in Concord and when brought to the mangers attention......nothing happens. ATTN: Managers. You level of service is terrible. Encourage training!!!!

Solid 4 for me.  But the service is below BoJangles"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. Not bad. Bar is good. Drinks are strong. Burgers are good. Nice outdoor eating area. One of the better places in Concord for this sort of dining. Better than 131 Main in Cornelius and 10x cheaper. At least my wife doesn't get sick here!"}
{"text":"Afton Tavern is a good local food choice.  My family and I enjoy sharing their warm cookie skillet- it is absolutely out of this world!!!  The food is okay, but the service is not very quick.  Also, some of the booth seating is not very comfortable, so I recommend sitting at a table when possible.  On the bright side, Afton Tavern's prices are vary reasonable for lunch and dinner.  The restaurant has different rooms that can be sectioned off to accommodate large private groups (perfect for large get togethers, team dinners, showers, graduations, etc.).  The atmosphere is very family friendly, and has items on the menu that are accommodating for guests of various ages."}
{"text":"Over priced for what you get.  The service was great and easy parking. Everything is just average.  It was really crowded and they need to redo the floor plan as everyone was bumping into each other"}
{"text":"Once again, Afton Tavern provided us with a tasty, affordable meal.  We went on a Saturday night at 6:00.  We were able to sit down right away and we had a monster glass of ice water within minutes of parking.  

My wife had a chicken sandwich (called the Everything Else sandwich?) with avacados, a couple other ingredients, and a side of sweet potato fries.  I had a Kickin Chicken sandwich with ranch and cucumbers and a side of regular fries.  The homemade wing sauce on the Kickin Chicken sandwich was amazing.  It had just the right balance of spicy and sweet.  They must make it with BBQ, hot sauce and maybe some ginger?  Whatever's in there, it was excellent.  The sweet potato fries were a 9 out of 10.  They could've been slightly crispier.  

The dessert was the best dessert I've ever had at a restaurant.  I don't care if you're not hungry for dessert, you HAVE to get the cookie skillet.  Imagine three freshly baked chocolate chip cookies, a scoop of ice cream, and whipped cream and chocolate syrup topping on a hot skillet.  This dessert literally melts in your mouth. You have to eat it fast which shouldn't be a problem for anyone. And yes, this is a kid friendly place; they do have milk!  You can get it in two different sizes, one with three cookies and one has six.  

Overall, Afton Tavern is definitely a restaurant we will return to.  The atmosphere is casual and kid friendly and the service was above average.  Our bill for two sandwiches, a couple waters and the best dessert ever was less than $30.  That's what I call a successful restaurant trip."}
{"text":"We have some friends that live right up the street from this place, and since it's opening a few months ago, we've been impressed.  

The menu is what I would expect from a fun, casual bar; big sandwiches, soups, salads, filling apps.  It's always tasted fresh, and I've enjoyed the burgers, wings, and boom boom shrimp.  Apps are half off every night after 8pm!

They always have good specials at the bar, as well.  

I know they do some kind of sunday family movie night; I've never been, but it's a cool idea.  

Service is consistently upbeat, prompt, and friendly.  

Even though it's a good 20 minutes from my house, I'm always happy to head up there (especially for $3 25oz imported drafts on thursdays!)."}
{"text":"Overpriced bar food. Service sucks. Got bad chicken and dumplings that the manager said they must have been in the pot too long. Yuck."}
{"text":"Afton Tavern
We chose to visit this family favorite for lunch on a Sunday.  I ordered the Nachos with chili and my wife ordered the Afton Tavern Signature Salad with her usual modifications. The nachos were served with white corn tortilla chips topped with spicy queso, diced peppers, cheddar cheese, and chili. They were great, with just the right amount of kick, and the chips stayed firm under the weight of the chili and queso. The Signature Salad included mixed greens, Fuji applies topped with fried chicken, pecans, bacon and blue cheese crumbles and served with a tangy Apple Cider Vinaigrette dressing. She enjoys the combinations in this salad, especially the fresh, light dressing. It's tucked back inside a mixed use neighborhood with residential townhomes above commercial businesses, a quiet neighborhood lunch/dinner spot that we enjoy at least weekly visits.

Overall I would highly recommend this restaurant for someone looking for a local restaurant offering exceptional food. I would rate this establishment 5 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food.

The restaurant was reviewed by Food Blogger Ernie Hiers. For other reviews see http://dorahiers.blogspot.com/"}
{"text":"this place is a crock of shit. the service is absolutely pitiful.  after waiting 45 minutes for our 3 meals, i got my entire dinner spilled all down the front of me.  which after getting completely covered in my food, the manager never even came over and apologized.  we also asked 4 times for napkins and never received any the entire meal. there was not an apologetic bone in anyone's body except the person who actually dumped my dinner all over me.   not recommended."}
{"text":"Don't order the fries. Found a black bug in mine. Manager came by and gave us a $20 Clift card to come back!  Nope never will."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, wait staff very friendly. Was in, seated, ordered, fed and out in an hour! Only thing that prevented 4 stars.... while the fish and chips was tasty, the breading was not as crispy as it should be. You should honestly be able to pick up the fish with your hands and it not break into pieces. We have tried the burgers (Great), and several other items on the menu as well."}
{"text":"Our most favorite spot! The staff are all wonderful & always have a smile on their face. Everyone is friendly as well as eager to please.
We love our Friday nights after the highschool sporting events.
If you've not been, you are missing out!"}
{"text":"I was here (Concord, NC) for an interview, and the night before I wanted to get a feel for the location, so where better to learn about a town than the local bar?  I couldn't find a bar \"downtown,\" so I was forced to go to a restaurant bar off the highway (I generally like to avoid these places, mostly because I'd prefer to support a local business).  This place was a lot better than I was expecting.

I got the buffalo chicken wrap, and it was really good.  +1 for the very helpful bartender who answered all my questions about the town, and gave me that feel for the town that I was looking for.  The bartender was also very good about keeping the beer flowing.  They were also surprisingly busy for a Sunday evening."}
{"text":"Had an event there tonight, March 7th, for 75 people, and it was fantastic. This is second year have had it at Afton Tavern, was even better this time. Will, the manager made sure everything went smoothly and it sure did. If looking for venue in Concord Mills area, check this place out. We had an event at Cabarrus Arena, and was close enough to the arena, but also right off I-85.
They did a buffet and everyone was raving about how good the salmon, shish kabobs, and chicken breast were! You have got to try the cookie skillet for dessert. We will be back in 2015..check them out!!"}
{"text":"We had Jake as our server the other day and he was phenomenal! He made wonderful menu recommendations and is a real jokester. The food is great but Jake's service is even better!"}
{"text":"Went with a big party, boom boom shrimp and spinach artichoke dip were both great! Also had a burger that was cooked perfectly. Definitely would recommend!!"}
{"text":"We just moved to NC so we have been trying out restaurants, this place has been the worst so far....the corn bread was beyond dry, my husbands crab cakes were horrible, my steak was way undercooked and so chewy I couldn't even eat it. They took of half the price for the steak and that was it. Worst $40 we have ever spent. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Our group of 18 was looking (well in advance!) for a dinner option on a Sunday evening that didn't scream, \"Large big-box chain\". We had a tough time finding a place that could accommodate our group on a Sunday, and would provide a full menu for everyone -- until we stumbled upon Afton! 

Our private space was ready when we arrived, and we were greeted with friendly servers immediately. We had access to the full menu, and the servers were more than happy to explain menu items AND give some of us (who are lovers of craft beer) feedback on best beers to try. 

The menu itself was large and vast enough to please a variety of nutritional lifestyles on the starter menu as well as the entree menu.

I'm really pleased our group found this place in Concord after searching high and low for a local dinner spot. Skip the chains. Buy and eat local!"}
{"text":"We eat at Afton Tavern pretty regularly (even had our rehearsal dinner there when it was Max/Ally's) but unfortunately the service has really gone downhill recently. Tonight we were there with a party of 8. Service was extremely slow. We ordered cheese fries as an appetizer and asked the bacon to be left off. Sure enough, when they came to the table, the bacon was not left off. We sent back the cheese fries. It was at least another 30 minutes before they brought us a replacement platter of cheese fries, but by this time, we'd almost finished our entrees, so what's the point. The person who brought our food to the table dropped a side of salsa all over my friend's new jacket. The dessert that my husband and I ordered was forgotten and not brought out with everyone else's, so we had to wait for them to make another cookie skillet while everyone else was eating. When we got the check, we were charged for 2 beers instead of 1, so we had to wait for them to adjust it and bring us a new check. 

To add insult to injury, a 20% gratuity was added to this check since our party was 8 people. I consider myself a very generous tipper for decent service, but there is NO WAY I would have given 20% for this experience. I think this was the nail in the coffin for us, as far as Afton Tavern goes."}
{"text":"\"Dem buffalo tenders is bomb.\" Service is a hit or miss though. Usually always friendly but sometimes not attentive."}
{"text":"Parking sucks. Everywhere we tried had a permit sign in front or mismarked handicap. Took us forever to find a legal spot to park. Went here for our anniversary. Wasn't expecting anything fancy. Just bar and grill. I wasn't impressed. It smelled awful upon walking in, literally like dried urine subway smell. Not promising when walking into a place to eat......but stuck with it. 
Ordered a diet Coke and it had the strangest flavor. Like musty or moldy leaves. I chalked it up to bad tasting tap water used to make it.  On the plus side they had 25oz. drafts on sale for $3!!!  By far the best cheese fries ever eaten!  Cheeseburger and tacos were just okay. Macaroni and cheese wasn't that special, nor were their sweet potato fries. 
Would I go back? Probably not. Only two good things. The cheese fries and beer special. B"}
{"text":"The Tav is awesome.  They've got some super awesome employees, some unique and delicious food items, and some good specials.  I know they used to do late night apps half off, but I think they have a whole new late night menu now.  

I love the bar-b-q chicken flatbread.  It's one of my favorite lunches."}
{"text":"Half price apps after 9!! Great wings. Excellent Chowder. Try the boom boom shrimp and definitely order the cookie skillet...or 2 cookie skillets."}
{"text":"Nice little tavern in the Concord area. Easy to get to. Good amount of parking. 

Fairly crowded for lunchtime on a Thursday, so a reservation may be a good way to go, especially if you're in a rush. Luckily, there was seating available in the bar area (table seating, not seating at the bar itself), so we were able to get started right away. 

Our server was sweet, but a clearly a little overwhelmed. This was most likely due to the high volume of seating that took place in the bar area within a matter of minutes, which she seemed to be handling entirely on her own. 

I kept it simple and ordered a bowl of chili. Yummy. My aunt and uncle both had the chili with a delicious-looking grilled cheese with it, which - I'm not going to lie - I was totally wanting as soon as I saw them. 

Overall, a very low-key, straight forward dining experience."}
{"text":"I was very skeptical of this place based on the reviews, but I recently attended a baby shower here and based on the reviews I was a little nervous about eating here but to my surprise the entree was very good and the service was great.  They have the perfect area for showers and other special events."}
{"text":"I want to like this place I just can't, the food is ok last time here but not great. Tonight the bar area smelled of chlorine and sulfer! The Draught beer lines need to be cleaned out, the wine selection is awful. It's too bad considering the great outdoor seating area, lots of potential just poor execution."}
{"text":"\"Great party location\" is nothing to boast about.

My sister and I reserved Afton Tavern's meeting room for my mom's birthday party.  We had a total of 30 guests.  I will first start by saying one of the managers, Jordan, was great with answering questions and making sure details were perfect.  However, she was not the manager who was in charge of setup/breakdown of the party.  The other general manager, who will not be named, was not warm or friendly at all.

The location is convenient, and the room was beautiful.  The food and service were nothing to brag about.  We had one \"head\" waitress.  Salads and drinks were constantly \"mixed up,\" meaning they weren't received or she didn't add them to the proper tab.

If you are planning a meeting here, make sure you get a room rental agreement in writing.  We were given different information by 3 different people.  We called and were told it was perfectly OK to come in and setup the cake/decorations early (while the restaurant was dead)  During the party, this same general manager, had stated that we would be charged a rental fee for \"setting up.\"  There was some verbal miscommunication with Afton that should have been resolved by getting something in writing.

Overall, my mom had a great time with family and friends. She still remains unaware of the party speed bumps.  

Party planners beware: get details from Afton Tavern in writing."}
{"text":"Afton Tavern is one of our favorite places!  We are typically there once a week.

The food is consistently yummy!  We each have our favorites but have tried most things on the menu.  My son loves the chicken & dumplings.  The hubby typically gets the Kickin' Chicken sandwich.  I switch it up between the grilled chicken sandwich (with avocado!) and the wedge salad.  The apple cider dressing is amazing, as is the house-made BBQ sauce.  And treat yourself to the cookie skillet!

The staff are friendly, fun and attentive.  The patio with the outdoor fireplace is perfect for casual gatherings, although the three of us usually sit in the bar area.

The Tavern also does family-friendly events throughout the year, including Scrabble Nights and Movie Nights.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Outdoor patio on a nice night, and it ended there. I ordered their wings in the house sauce with a side of sweet potato fries. First they fries were cold, I sent them back and 10 minutes later still no fries. I told the waitress to not bother. The wings, deep fried to death... It was like the turkey from Christmas vacation. DRY as sand!!! Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"I ate here during a recent business trip after it was recommended by some coworkers.  It was a slightly chilly Charlotte evening, but we wanted to sit outside -- we asked the hostess if they would be turning the outdoor fireplace or heat lamps on, but she said they would not.  We ended up sitting outside anyway, and asked our waitress if there was any way they would consider turning one of the heating apparatuses on.. she said she would check and let us know.  I assume the verdict was still \"no,\" because they weren't turned on during our dinner, even though myself and several other patrons outside were obviously shivering.

Anyway, we went there for dinner -- I ordered the shrimp tacos with a side of rice pilaf.  The tacos were good, and served with a bit of the famous Boom Boom Sauce in each one.  The rice pilaf wasn't anything to write home about, but it was still good. I even added a little to each of my tacos for an added treat.  The 3 people I was with seemed to enjoy their meals, though none of us were blown away.  Overall this is a good place for a quick bite... Prices for most of their menu items are extremely reasonable, and they offer some more pricey entrees if your stomach so desires.  I hear their lunch is much better than dinner, so maybe I'll try that out next time!"}
{"text":"Every time we go here we have a positive experience.  Specials on craft beers on Thursdays and super ice cream sundaes for the kids for $1.  Menu is excellent, service right on.  Today I enjoyed the Josh fish tacos:  3 tacos with choice of shrimp, mahi mahi or chicken or combo.  I chose the fish combo and it was Delish.

They never disappoint!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and Angela at the bar area was the best.  Our table had marinated chicken breast, fish n chips and ribeye all were excellent. Must try their homemade ranch, all entrees come with house salad which was the best salad ever! A definite must try if you are in the Concord/Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Innovative Menu. Great service.

Went  to Afton Tavern today with wife's son and his family to celebrate the youngest's 8th birthday.

Menu offered something for all. I have Lexi's Chicken and Dumplings as a starter followed by a great Rueben. My wife had a Steak Philly as did my daughter-in law. Sue's son had Manhattan Clam Chowder and a Chicken Salad plate.  As far the kids, one had her favorite Mac and Cheese while the Birthday boy had  couple of sliders.

Everyone enjoyed their meals.

Service was great and I love the relaxed atmosphere of this place.  Prices were very reasonable and I would readily recommend."}
{"text":"I went for lunch and was seated (at a patio table) immediately. I found the staff to be friendly and efficient. The turkey wrap and steak philly that my husband and I ordered were made perfectly."}
{"text":"I just realized after coming here forever, I have not reviewed this place.   This is one of my wife and kids favorite spots, everything on the menu is scratch made and absolutely excellent.   The reason for my posting is that I noticed on their menu that Chicken Wings are back.  I am not sure that I ever noticed them on the menu in the past, but whatever.  I have been there twice in the past couple weeks and both times, I really liked the wings.  As far as I can tell, they are not frozen.   I ordered them extra crispy, perfectly lightly breaded where the meat has a nice pop off the bone.   I am not sure if they make their own buffalo sauce, but its butter creamy traditional buffalo sauce.  I really like the flavor, with a mild hotness factor.    I had the Boom Boom Shrimp, which comes with their KaBoom sauce.   The shrimp are great, but the KaBoom sauce not so much.   It is okay, but here is what I did --- I ordered a little bowl of the buffalo sauce and dipped the shrimp in it, YUM.   Next time I will just order the Boom boom shrimp with buffalo sauce, Yass Pleez!!!!!

The service is always awesome and the staff is great.   Thursday nights, it is half price mug night - at least last night was.    Thank you Afton for supporting the local craft folks."}
{"text":"Entrance is small.  Lots of people waiting and no hostess around or another person to cover.  After 5 min, the hostess reappears.  Starts helping whoever she sees instead of asking who was next.  I took a seat at the high-tops at the bar rather than wait. 
  The Tavern Chips were ok, but for $5 they were nothing special. Had the crab cake sandwich w/ roasted red potatoes for the side.  Good sandwich and Bang sauce was spicy.  Potatoes were tasty as well. 
  The wait staff and bartender were great but this place is above average in my opinion. Some of the menu items were pretty pricey and a $10 burger better be dynamite.  Otherwise, it's an expensive meal. Thought it interesting that $2.50 domestic beers don't include Sam Adams (brewed in Boston).  Oh well."}
{"text":"Huge portions. 
Bacon on the hickory chicken sandwich is nice and thick. Fish is pretty good.
Red potatoes and fries came out a bit cold."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for lunch and each time the service has been quite slow.

I ordered the lunch salad the first time and on my last visit, I had the turkey burger. Very mediocre food that just took too long to be served. The tables are 'dressed' with brown paper and crayons so you can draw while you wait.....and wait. The beverages are served pub-style meaning your soda/water/tea/etc will come out in a huge glass that's similar to that of a beer mug. I mean, it's B-I-G and well worth the less than $2 charge.

Other than that, the menu is stocked with all of the typical American fare. It's a good spot for OK food just not quick service."}
{"text":"We really like the Afton Tavern. The food is mostly good and the desserts are terrific. If it's near you birthday, you get a free Jordan's Cookie Skillet. Yummy."}
{"text":"I actually come here ALOT with my family since it's literally 5 minutes away from my house! I tried numerous things on their menu but the salmon salad would always be my go to! They give you a hugee piece of salmon & their salad is so fresh! It's not the best I've had but it's pretty dang good for a typical salmon salad! Everyone comes here & raves about their famous cookie skillet, but honestly I feel like I'm scooping sugar lol! The cookie is waaay to sweet and so is the icecream so it's really not for me. But must try if you have an really, really sweet tooth! (:"}
{"text":"Great selection of food, nice cozy atmosphere.  Our server was very pleasant, just took a little long on getting to our table & not as attentive as should be.  My burger was very dry, but I'd come back to try something different."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a peculiar layout and is dark inside. They do have a patio where you can dine. The food is good but nothing special. Staff seems rushed but attentive to our needs. The owners also have another restaurant very nearby, that operates under the name Afton Pub & Pizza. I think Afton Pub & Pizza has better food and recommend it over Afton Tavern.

Parking can be problematic since there are many other businesses and the YMCA nearby."}
{"text":"Do not eat here. Just don't. 

We went after the lunch rush, so the restaurant was slow and quiet. We were seated by the kitchen doors and could hear the chefs talking and what not. Maybe if they spent less time bull shitting around, they wouldn't have burnt our order of potatoes wth bacon and cheese. Or given me a cheese burger instead of a chicken sandwich. The ranch dressing is soup. The decor is a bit dated and on the shabby side. The manager comped us our app and gave us free coupons for their cookie platter thing but that was it. Our waitress was scarce and the food was sub par.

They definitely need to be on restaurant impossible, it's the only way we would ever come back here."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times, and had good experiences both times.

I did a casual weekday lunch with some co-workers one time.  They do have a nice reduced portion/price lunch menu which we all ordered off of.  I got a salad topped with salmon which was good but I could've used a larger peice of salmon, but I do have a big apetite!

On my second visit my boyfriend and I had a late dinner with drinks on a Friday night.  We went casual, Nachos for an appetizer, Me and Reuben, He a burger and of course the Cookie Skillet for dessert!

Everything was good.....nothing I'm raving over, but it's a cute spot and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best food around town! Ate lunch and dinner here multiple times with my family, friends and dog. They have never let me down. 10/10 I will be back again!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed! The food was cold when I finally got it and was not correct. It took forever for me to be able to send it back and was starving. I was given the crappy food for free, but was really disappointed. After dinner everyone I talked to said they stopped going here because the food is not good! The cheese dip was good. What made me the most mad was the manager never came over and said a word to us! Totally unprofessional and I will NOT be going back!"}
{"text":"The Management is awful. I saw others being treated poorly, then I experienced it firsthand myself. They are not appreciative and grateful of their regulars, instead they treat us badly. You will receive your bill 20 mins before closing, and if you ask for anything else they will insult you by saying your you are cut off because they want to go home. Don't visit this place near closing time, or you may have a rude server and a bad experience."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on 4/21/2018 expecting more......the menu looks awesome, incredible selection of items. A Saturday night at 6:45, so i expected a wait and was pleasantly surprised to be seated  after 10 minutes. 
The server was pleasant, but not efficient.....anyway, long story short, we were in and out in just over 2 hours (way too long), i had a club sandwich with soggy steak cut fries and my wife had fish and chips with tasteless coleslaw and tasteless sweet potato fries.....not a place to write home about. I guess i will give it one more chance this summer because they have a nice outdoor dining area and a live band......more to come.."}
{"text":"This place is way overpriced for what you get. Nothing tastes fresh, not many healthy choices and sometimes very slow service. Ordered the crab cakes once and had to send them back they were awful!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best. Not terrible, I guess. But overpriced for the quality. I had a ribeye which was over cooked and way too thin. Mealy texture and a poor quality cut. Totally lacking flavor. The salad was good at least. 

My wife got a burger which was actually undercooked. 

Service was also mediocre. Polite staff but didn't seem experienced. And while we would have liked to have sent back our food due to it being prepared incorrectly, we couldn't find our server to ask. 

My biggest issue is that the food is the same quality you'd expect from a cheap diner or cheap bar food. But the prices make you think you're getting a fine dining experience. Yet it's hardly that."}
{"text":"This used to be a standard favorite, but the last two times I've been there were not good. The food and service weremediocre at best and the staff looked like they'd had a rough night out the night before. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Ordered two entrees for take out. After we arrived back at home we found out that none of the sides were packed with our meal, but they did include two pieces of bread that no one asked for. Used to like this place but their service has steadily gone downhill and would not recommend them any longer."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants.  The battered shrimp are fantastic!  I'm not normally a fan of breaded or battered shrimp, but these are absolutely wonderful!  The batter is light and crispy.  The burgers are quite good as well.  A must have on the dessert menu is the chocolate chip cookie skillet.  OMG!!  This is to die for!  Additionally, the staff is always friendly and very attentive.  They never leave dirty dishes sitting the tables either."}
{"text":"Met up for a family dinner here. I ordered the shrimp wrap and squash/zucchini. The wrap was good-- not great. The squash and zucchini was 4 giant pieces of squash so I was disappointed in that. The general consensus was that the everyone's food was pretty mediocre. Service was fine. However, the smell of the sanitation products was a little overwhelming-- and not in a good way. They do have a nice patio I would like to check out some time!"}
{"text":"We happened in one weekend morning while wandering about the area, and found the space very welcoming.  Even the outdoor patio seemed nice, but it was a little too crisp to be enjoyable.  A nice spring or fall day and that would have surely been awesome as well.

Somewhat surprised by the space on the inside - it is much larger than it looks.  There were a whole lot more people than we expected too.  Unfortunately this seemed to bog down the service.  They were friendly enough, but not particularly fast.

When it came to the food, it was perhaps a step above your fast casual fare - so if you are in the mood for Applebee's or Ruby Tuesday, go a bit of your way and check this place instead.  Otherwise, you might want to find something else."}
{"text":"Food is always good at Afton Tavern and the service is very friendly. Great for group get-togethers or a nice date night. Most importantly, order a cookie skillet for dessert- they're to die for!"}
{"text":"Have been here many times.  Always busy. Great shrimp wrap, chicken and dumplings soup, salads and chicken sandwich.  Food is reasonable priced and service is always fast."}
{"text":"Ordered the Mahi tacos, but I didn't receive mahi. I'm sure what I got wasn't mahi. And it wasn't good by any means, I'm not a complainer at all. The others at the table had a good experience with their choices. I will come back but I won't order mahi."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Afton Tavern on about 5 different occasions and have loved it every time. I always try something new off their extensive menu and have been happy 4 out of the 5 times. My only complaint is with the \"Fish & Chips\" that is offered. 

It is not your typical fish and chips so I was disappointed. I was served a filet-o-fish and this is not what fish and chips is to me. However the fish was crisp and delicious so I was too upset. I've had the burgers, tavern tacos and the chicken & dumplings. All were tasty and would definitely order these items again. 

Must try the cookie skillet & oatmeal scotchie for dessert=awesome."}
{"text":"I am rating Afton Tavern 5 stars because there is nothing else like it around.  Across the highway there are some chain restaurants but this is much better.  Our friends that we met there are frequent guests and they love it.  The drinks are priced good and it is a good atmosphere and location.
The Bacon Cheese Fries come with waffle fries which is great for scooping all of the toppings up.  They will also toss your chicken tenders in wing sauce at no extra charge.  
Next time I want to try the fish and chips."}
{"text":"I love eating here! Everything I have tried has been wonderful. I like the BBQ chicken skillet. Very tasty. The best part, however, are the cookie skillets! They have chocolate chip and butterscotch, both are delicious."}
{"text":"I dig this place and would go back for another meal. Our group headed over for lunch and drinks after running the ROC Race up at the Speedway. My friend told the hostess we had 8 and wanted the patio and they put two tables together. Another friend was joining us and I informed the hostess that we would have 9 instead of 8 and she acted like she didn't know what to do. It took about another 4 to 5 minutes for her to come outside and slide a two-top table right beside the table together with the rest.

The waitress was polite but not overly friendly. She would come over and ask if we needed anything but really only took care of one side of the table so our friends sitting on the opposite end were constantly waiting to order another drink. 

We started with the bacon cheese fries and they were so good! The fries were waffle fries and the stringy gooey cheese was plentiful. I ended up getting the crab cake sandwich which was tasty. It came with a side of specialty sauce. Hate that I can't remember the name but it had a kick of spice and worked perfectly with the flavors of a seafood sandwich. I opted for the mac and cheese with it which was good but nothing great. Pretty average and wished it would have been creamier. 

The Sunday drink special is half priced bottles of wine and nothing else which really sucks when you are looking forward to a Sunday funday. My Bloody Mary was $7 which I feel is a bit high. I think I've just been spoiled by all the great places in Charlotte that offer cheap Bloody Marys and mimosas on Sunday... but even Chili's standard price for a Mary is $5. 

The service was prompt and the food came out in a timely manner. I would like to swing back by and try it again as the menu had so many things that just sounds delicious. I'm not in Concord all that much but if I'm ever up that way and hungry, I'll surely stop by again and give it another go... the mahi grilled tacos sound delicious and I was jealous when someone else at the table ordered them - it look yummy as well!"}
{"text":"Had a nice waitress. Nice setting.. good menu options.. but I came here specifically for the cookie skillet since I had heard so many people say it was great. I did not like it at all.. neither did my mom. The cookies were barely cooked & tasted like dough. I told the waitress and she said that it was supposed to be like that but she didn't offer to take it off our bill.."}
{"text":"Not really a fan. The food is sub-par and the service definitely could use some work. I only like when they have Red Oak on special and there's half priced appetizers at night. Besides that, I wouldn't consider going - and I live super close to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here one evening to meet a friend that lives in this area.  I had her pick the spot because she is more familiar with this area than I am.  The food was decent, nothing special, but overall pretty good.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come back, but would stop if I was in the area.  

It was fairly busy for a weeknight and got crowded as the night went on.  The service was good.  I would try this place for lunch or dinner again sometime.  Not a bad visit."}
{"text":"Good place to go if you want some good food in your stomache before the lush inside you comes out. 

Try the carmel apple martini, it will let you forget about that summer heat and remind you that fall's crisp air awaits you in the near future.  : )

Went here with a group of 6, I believe I had some type of chicken entree... and it was good. 
Good hang out spot to grab drinks and hang out or talk with friends."}
{"text":"I saw the waitress being very rude to a patron and stop serving alcohol because she was closing her station down. She also decided to argue back with her customers which was not a good look as a server or for the restaurant. I was very disappointed in how the manager responded to the situation and made matters worse. He too was very argumentative. This was the first time I had ever been and after seeing how the waitress and manager treated other customers, I do not think I'll be attending again.  Two stars because they served beer and apps"}
{"text":"I would definitely come back to this place. The burgers were great and they service was good. I highly recommend the burger."}
{"text":"Love coming here for the cookie skillet! Me and my boyfriend are regulars. Love Amber & Alyssa, they have great customer service & always make me wanna come back! 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Solid 4.5 here.  I liked this place.  Popped in at 7pm on a Saturday night and was happy to score a small but comfy booth with no wait.  (There was a line waiting to get in when we left).  We had an affable, likeable server named Ben who really added to the experience, he was a nice guy who tried hard and checked back frequently and at the right time to replenish drinks, always a plus.  There was also a manager or backwaiter who'd check in on drinks and helped clear our table, a surprising little extra at a place that's not terribly expensive.  I wish they were located closer to LKN so we could go back more frequently!

We tried a bit of everything.  Appetizer, dinner, dessert and martinis.  It was $6 martini night and we tried the caramel apple (vodka, apple schnaps, sweet and sour and caramel drizzle) and a stupendous pineapple upside down cake (vanilla vodka, amaretto, pineapple juice and grenadine).  Seriously good enough for me to note the ingredients to replicate at home, delish.

I noticed they had lump crabcakes as a dinner option but I knew I wanted to try the tacos so I compromised by ordering the hot crab dip $10.  We got a decent amount of dip and a generous amount of garlic flatbread and super thin tortilla chips.  Super thin tortilla chips are my favorite, I hate when you get thick heavy tortilla chips.  I'm going to try their queso and/or spinach and artichoke dip next visit, this place was worth another visit.

My husband ordered a turkey burger with all the fixings and a creamy, cheesy mac n' cheese as his side.  The burger was well-seasoned and a hefty size, it looked like a good 1/2 lb portion.  Just $9.  I ordered the three tacos $10, and Ben asked if I wanted one of each (crispy shrimp, grilled mahi mahi and grilled chicken).  I said yes, definitely and it came with lettuce, tomato, shredded cheese and their spicy KaBoom sauce.  The shrimp was far and away the winner with it's perfect fried coating and KaBoom accent.  I'd get again but make all three the shrimp.  They weren't perfect, I can't put my finger on it but i think it was the shredded, heated cheddar cheese I wasn't fond of.  Maybe Americanizing it a little less and instead of lettuce, tomato and shredded cheddar topping with shredded cabbage, onion, tomato (or pico de gallo) and cilantro with perhaps a sprinkling of cotija cheese?  It was pretty darned good though, the fried shrimp were spot on!  The KaBoom sauce was a nice touch too.

For desert we tried that decadent Oatmeal Scotchie ($8).  A piping hot out-of-the-oven serving of oatmeal butterscotch cookies topped with vanilla ice cream and caramel syrup, it was also available as a half size.  

All in all, interesting menu that I plan to try again at a future time, affable server with personality and a cute little Birkdale-esqe location.  Give it a try, it's got a hometown vibe and the little bar area looked perfect for the nights you just want to go out for a few drinks."}
{"text":"This place was a little sketchy.. Only the outside tables looked appealing but the wife wanted to stay inside.  It happened to be family movie night and there was a huge video playing on a 100 inch screen. - Luckily it was the football game but there still was kids all over the place.  I ordered the half rack - meh.  And their homemade mac n cheese - MEH.   If anything, you should come here just to try out the cookie skillet dessert.  That was delicious.  Other than that, good luck finding the place and enjoy what you can.

-Ian M."}
{"text":"Great lunch and dinner location, for the entire family. You can order a colossal burger and pile it up mile high with all of your favorites! Oh yes, you have to order the sweet potato fries with it and a chocolate cookie skillet for dessert! Yummy! Bon app√©tit...."}
{"text":"We've just moved to this area so we've tried this place out several times recently, and haven't been WOW'ed. The food is basic mediocre bar type food, the inside atmosphere is more traditional and outdated however the service is always great. Carrie our most recent server has been the absolute best. She is so personable and great that it made the food being mediocre worth it. We come back due to the lack of local options in the area, but do hope that the food could improve a little."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times for multiple different reasons. The last couple of times the service seems to be lacking a bit. Last night we went for a birthday and barely saw our server. Several people in our party had food come out that was cool. I'm not one to complain because I understand accidents happen but my food was cold, wrong, and I never got a refill. I will give it one more shot here because the food is typically good but I go by 3 strikes and you're out."}
{"text":"Typical bar food, done pretty well. Not a lot of vegetarian options, but the black bean burger is tasty, and they'll do the salads without meat. Great sweet potato fries and you can get broccoli instead of chips with the spicy cheese dip, which I think is kind of cool.

The patio is lovely in nice weather but there is usually a wait at prime times. Half price bottles of wine on Sundays is a GREAT special, and they'll wrap your bottle for you to take with. Really nice place to have a drink with friends (on the patio!) on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant! We have been here a handful of times in the past year and have never had a bad experience. The waiting staff has always been friendly and we usually have top-notch service. I love sitting outside near the fireplace when the weather is nice...great atmosphere!

I really enjoy the burgers and the chicken and dumpling soup. Yummy! And although I've never saved enough room for dessert, I have seen the awesome cookie skillet and heard it is delicious! I'll have to remember to go there one day just for the cookie skillet. :)"}
