{"text":"Best Sate Beef around, hands down!!  We are so excited to have good veitnamese in the NW! We have dined in 2x and ordered take out at least 3x. The Sate Beef is different than others and far better.  The vermicelli is always good too. The cuts of meat in the soup and vermicelli are good.  The prices are competitive.  The spring rolls aren't greasy like some places.  And you don't need a nap an hour after dinner with the food that they serve here. We will be back!"}
{"text":"First experience at this place was not great at all.  Very slow for take out and by the time we drove  two blocks home our order was completely cold.  Thought I would give it another try after about 3 months.  This evening was slightly better but still below average.  The lady taking orders was not friendly whatsoever.   Spring rolls seemed like they had been refried multiple times and were burnt.  Vermicelli dishes were ok but nothing spectacular.   I think I will pass on round 3."}
{"text":"We had the spring rolls , pho sate and the rare beef pho (pho tai).   First off.  It was not busy at all on a Saturday lunch time.   We had to ask for a pot of tea.   The soup for the sate is missing the dept of the sate.   tastes too weak and diluted and more like MSG enriched.     The pho soup is too oily, can really taste the beef fat and too much anise taste.     The spring rolls is way over priced and the filling is too mashed up with too much taro and not enough meat   NOT authentic at all.   Will not go back, there are better places in the NW"}
{"text":"Love this little family run restaurant.  The service is always amazing, and the food is great too! I always have the same dish but that's because it's sooooo good!"}
{"text":"I just recently moved into the area  and had to get my bearing by scouting out the restaurants nearby. I'm glad there's a decent Viet place should I have a hankering for pho or vermicelli and don't want to venture far.  For the record, the pho sate is VERY spicy. As is their sate beef noodle bowl. Both delicious but you will be guzzling glasses of water.   Seeing how they are an up and coming restaurant, it's very clean and the service is top notch. I hope they continue to keep these two things as they progress."}
{"text":"Well first off - they caught me on my check in! ;) we ordered the xl beef satay soup and chicken salad rolls.  Both were fresh and good!  The broth was hot and spicy but not too intense.  Maybe just a touch on the oily side, but I would rather than than too little.    As in my check in I was quite hopeful that it would be better than some of the other Viet places in the northwest and I was not disappointed.   My wife and I will absolutely be back several times.  You should check this place out, no complaints."}
{"text":"This little place is new and is in the mall by the Nolan Hill traffic circle.  It is bright, clean and staffed by pleasant and efficient folks.  Since moving to the Sherwood area, it has become our go to Vietnamese location. Initially,  I would have the Tofu over vermicellii ( I am vegetarian ) but have since gone on to have what I consider to be  ThE BEST Vietnamese sub in the city, the best I have ever had.  Its a lemon grass tofu sub. You can also have different variations of subs, but without a doubt they are the best, layers of flavours and topped with crushed peanuts.... the level of detail on the sub is what sets it apart from so many others I have tried.  This restaurant has become increasingly busy since they opened - I hope the trend continues as they certainly deserve the business - check them out, they are great."}
{"text":"So far so good, we've had takeout from this place twice and the food has been delicious both times. I will be going back for more."}
{"text":"Pretty average Vietnamese. Staff was friendly and service was prompt. Will go back because of convenience more than anything."}
{"text":"Very good service. The restaurant looks clean with soft Viet music that is not too loud. The seatings are quite comfy. A good place for a relaxing lunch and casual chats with friends.   Their regular water is lemon infused which makes it taste very refreshing. The noodle soup is pretty good portion with decent pricing. The overall taste is quite good, although I do find the taste of the soup somewhat like powdered and not from scratch. Fresh beansprout and a good generous portion in comparison to some other stores closer to DT. The bowls are also ceramic unlike some other joints with cheap plastic and faded pattern.   During Monday to Friday, their lunch menu is a really good deal. A good sized salad roll, a bowl of vermicelli with your meat choice and a drink for only $11!  Every time I am back, the restaurant seems to improve in someway. I'd definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I went there for a takeout beef pho, and it was awesome, it was spicy, and full of vegetables.  The quantity I got for the price was fantastic, it fed me dinner, and lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Moved to Nolan Hill not long ago, and as a hardcore Pho enthusiast, I have to say that this place is one of the greatest Pho restaurant I have been to in Calgary so far.  The prices are good, service is awesome and friendly, and the amount of food they give you for the price is great!  I highly recommend their Pho dac biet."}
{"text":"I've given this restaurant 3 chances based solely on the fact that it's within walking distance to my house.  The first visit resulted in what tasted like boiled chicken, noodles and quail eggs in water. It was bland, tasteless and inedible - I gave up after 5 bites.  The second time of stir fried curry chicken on rice was slightly better, but still far behind any typical/authentic Vietnamese curry dish. It lacked depth, the chicken was dry and the typical creamy curry goodness was missing. The most recent visit was the best amongst the three with regular pho. I only call this the best because compared to the other two, it was better. If I was to compare it to other pho restaurants however,  it's absolutely not up to par. The broth was thin, lacked depth and needed generous amounts of Hoi sin and sriracha to enhance the flavor. To give it some perspective,  I'd rather drag my hungover butt halfway across the city for good pho than consider coming here.  2 stars for good service and that it's close by if I'm reaaaaaaaaaally desperate though. But seriously,  don't mess with me and noodles."}
{"text":"Their pho soup base is different from other restaurant we went, it is rich and tasty! We were told by the friendly owner there's no MSG. Their sate beef viet sub is also very good, the sate sauce is full of peanut flavor, one thing I would hope is they can have meat inside. Overall it's a very nice restaurant and their food is tasty!"}
{"text":"This is your run of the mill pho place. I've been to several pho places in Calgary and this one was close to my house so I thought I'd try it. I got the beef with flank pho with half noodles and extra beef. When they brought it to me I asked if this is with the extra beef? Our server checked and came back letting me know, indeed it was.  I would hate to see what the regular order looked like. It's not bad, it's not the best either. I'd go back for the convenience but they are stingy on the beef."}
