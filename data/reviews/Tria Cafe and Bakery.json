{"text":"Warm atmosphere, superb service, so yummy and delicious food! Three main reasons make me drive every Sunday an hour to enjoy this great place... Tria is my second home in the city, it is totally wheelchair accessible for my son Adnan, dishes are super generous and customized to the best of the client's interest! The owner/s are always there welcoming and taking extra personal care of their visitors... The selection of desserts in the display, the tasteful coffee, and the many many favorite savories offered are more than I would want in one place... Thank you Tria for offering the best of the best service and food!"}

{"text":"Great for lunch or a coffee . Friendly staff and nice decor. Large seating area the red chairs are funky but a bit short for table seating ."}
{"text":"Comfortable cafe. Plenty of seating. Stopped for lunch and a coffee. The service was quite nice. Efficient, friendly and accommodating. Large assortment of food options and a large display of desserts. I was dining solo and was happy to see window bar seating. Caught up on some email using the free wifi.  Loved the salmon and cream cheese on a multi grain bagel."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. They were not use to making what we asked for,but it turned out great. The owner even gave us samples of there desserts."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch spot food is fresh and taste amazing , lots of sweets and treats for the whole gang ! 10/10 staff 10/10 experience"}
{"text":"Not happy with the service. The staff there closed the cafe 20 minutes before closing time and asked me to leave. The coffee and the food tasted a bit old."}
{"text":"This is really cozy and favorable cafe,nice customer service with all smiles and greeting!food is excellent and affordable,ordered two vege samoaas cost $3.50 and breakfast egg burrito with egg and cheese only,macchino halal crispy chicken burger with fries with black tea all cost $25 but then got frozen veg samoaas 12 for 20 bucks kind of costly.
but would highly recommend Tria cafe"}
{"text":"A very nice place to have a Sunday morning omelet, home fries are delicious and the coffee is just fine. Quite good, good priced. The only caveat, they didn't have croissant and offered a sandwich instead."}
{"text":"As nice as the place looks...it's very over priced. I was charged $12 for 1 small sesame bagel with haloumi cheese and tomato which made no sense. I can buy a whole block of haloumi cheese for less than that and make multiple sandwiches. Sure enough I cancelled my order. I've been there once before and the food is good and atmosphere is nice...but again it's nothing extra that justifies how over priced everything is."}
{"text":"This place used to be very good. Although drastically over priced at least the food was good. Lately in the last 2 months the food has declined. Strange mixes of flavours much less care in preparation. Maybe a new cook. Disappointing since I go to my doctor in the building."}
