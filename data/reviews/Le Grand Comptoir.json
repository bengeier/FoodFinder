{"text":"I was searching for French food that doesn't cost more than my entire wardrobe. I'm so glad I found Le Grand Comptoir on yelp! It's exactly how the entire 2 reviewers described it. It's not intimidating, the prices are reasonable, the waiters are friendly, the portions are substantial. I ordered the pork tenderloin and it's soooo tender!!! It came with a creamy mustard sauce. Mmm mmm! I ate every morsel on my plate, the fries, the salad, the pork! It's a good thing Montreal is a walkable city because I can't stop eating the amazing food!"}
{"text":"The food was very fresh and tasty. We ordered salads (chicken and Niçoise ) from the lunch menu. For desert we took caramelized apple and cappuccino. Well it was nice though I was not trilled :-). Overall service and food were excellent."}
{"text":"This was a good place to eat. We had the sirloin steak which needed no sauce and made the way we wanted. I gave it a 4 because of its small dining room area, but they had great service and friendly environment and I would go again."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for lunch today. I ordered a very uninspiring steak frite. Honestly the dish was okay. The steak was alright. The fries were alright. The salad was a complete afterthought, just lettuce with tomato. I paid $30 including tax and tip. By Montréal standards for this price, I'm expecting to be impressed. Or at least an attempt at originality. There are so many good restos in this city, and this one is just not one of them."}
{"text":"I ate at this restaurant this past weekend and would highly recommend it. It was the most authentic French bistro food I have had outside of Paris. Plus excellent, personalized service.  Nothing fancy, but if you are looking for good, relatively inexpensive, French food in a non-intimidating friendly setting this is your place! 

Try the steak frites!"}
{"text":"The service was nice but the quality of the food was just OK. The duck and pork were dry and the salad wasn't anything special. The pate and soup were good."}
{"text":"Lovely place with fantastic staff.

I love their soups. Every dish comes with a starter soup and it was never the same soup twice! If I could I would order a three course meal of their soups.
The food is very basic, which is nice. Usually you get a salad, some type of meat, and fries, along with a starter soup. 

They do favor their salt, so I did find a few of their dishes to be over salted, so fair warning to those who watch their sodium intake! 

I always make sure to visit this place whenever I am in Montreal, and I recommend you do too if you want a nice, basic but tasty meal."}
{"text":"Look, I'm not a french food expert by any stretch. The fries aren't different from fast food and you pay a lot by-the-bite. But I do have to give Le Grand Comptoir some props.

For starters - the staff is friendly and willing to work with non-locals. (In old-school eating style they have a big pin-map on the wall to show where different customers have come from.) They handled our stumbling in with a smile, poured the wine, and gladly took our orders. If you need an entry-level french food experience (ie: low on the french, and a few baby steps into the eating), this is a good place to start. Some soup, some meat, some frites, some wine - enough to orient you in the right direction but not the full-blast of a more expensive restaurant over in the Old Port.

The downside is obviously quantity. I gather bistro food is meant to be quicker and lighter, and for our money was definitely that. (Ordering the sausage, for example, means one sausage.) It's not really a black mark - soup, wine, and entrees are a great way to eat but not feel heavier on the way out - but you'll definitely wonder a little bit after getting hit with the sticker shock. All told, our food was chosen, served, devoured and paid for in hardly more than an hour! Three people should expect to make it out alive under a hundred dollars, depending on how much you order. (Foie Gras will obviously boost the number.)

To me, Le Grand Comptoir is a starter restaurant. Perfect for a light meal in the area or as an introduction to more daring locales. It should expose you to the tastes, experience, and the cost of eating en francais. I'm not sure I'd go back, but I don't regret the experience either."}
{"text":"Excellent bistro français. Menu classique. Un voyage à Paris à peu de frais."}
{"text":"Incredibly rude. My food came cold and instead of addressing the situation the manager/owner rudely told me off. Not surprising given he was yelling at people on the sidewalk"}
{"text":"This place is a true hidden gem. The service was amazing, polite, attentive, and accommodating of our food allergies. The restaurant is small, and clean with no frills as is the menu. If you're looking for fresh, delicious, amazing food with very little pretension at a great price this is the place for you! I would go back once a week if I could."}
{"text":"Gazpacho was delicious and the sangria was very good. I had Salade Niçoise. It was too large for me to eat it all, and it was excellent--anchovies, capers, French beans, tuna, black olives, eggs all accounted for! My husband had the daily pasta special. He liked it but felt that it came out too hot. 
This is a good restaurant and reasonably priced. There were not many others dining when we were there. Puzzled by this because it's a great place. Very cute inside and excellent outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"Simple food, very good service. The escargot appetizer was very good. The terrace is nice an big. It's not too far from la Place des Festivals and it is a solid alternative to the more expensive restaurants like Brasserie T. The steaks are of very good quality and perfectly cooked. The wine list is decent, but limited, correctly priced. Good value for the money!"}
{"text":"To echo the other reviews, Le Grand Comptoir offers quality French cuisine in a friendly setting, all at a very reasonable price.

One thing I have to add is that I would highly recommend the desserts. Their white chocolate and raspberry cheesecake is one of the best I have ever had. We also tried a flaky pastry dessert, covered in chocolate and served with ice cream, and it was simply divine. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I stopped in here recently and was pleasantly surprised.  This place didn't have quite as good reviews as the places I typically choose, but we chose to go here based on its convenient location between hotels.  It was a very simple place but the service was friendly and the food was good so I can't complain.  

I ordered the duck and it was cooked perfectly.  Other than the duck itself the meal was kind of boring.  It came with a salad and fries similar to what you would receive at a deli.  The wine menu is cheaper than most of the others in the area and the selection is still very good.

Overall I'm giving it 4 stars for its great location, decent prices, and good food.  I wouldn't call this a hidden gem but I would happily return if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Bonne ambiance, service efficace et prix raisonnable 
Parfait pour un voyageur cherchant calme et dîner de bonne qualité au centre de Montréal"}
{"text":"We were the first two customers in Le Grand Compoir Restaurant on this Friday evening around 6:30pm in a busy area of Montreal. We called around earlier to several 5 star French Restaurants but they were all booked solid. Initially we felt lucky to have found this place that wasn't busy at all.

My wife ordered the special which was Osso Bucco (Pork with gravy), broccoli, salad and a bowl of vegetable soup (actually looked and tasted like split pea). The Osso Bucco was good but not outstanding. The broccoli was steamed perfectly but lacked favor.

I had the Salmon which came with diced tomatoes and basil on top. The rest of the dish came with broccoli, rice and also with the same vegetable soup. All the food was served hot. But I found the way the Salmon was prepared just didn't work. While the Salmon was hot and moist, putting cold diced tomatoes and basil on top did nothing to enhance the taste. The rice also lacked taste and really didn't go with Salmon. Again the broccoli for me also lacked taste.

We also had the house Merlot wine. Here again, it just wasn't that good.

The service was excellent."}
{"text":"The service was frankly abysmal. The waiter started by asking what we wanted without asking for drinks or anything. When we couldn't decide because we hadn't had enough time to look through the menu, he said he had to leave and come back because he was too busy. When we did finally order and the food arrived, it was a joke. The chicken in my sandwich was dry, and their excuse for a salad was some shredded lettuce and a single quarter of a tomato with mayonnaise dressing lightly drizzled over the top. My mothers salad nicoise came with no egg or olives. Apparently they cost extra but they were never offered. Tl;dr: you'd literally have to pay me to go back here."}
{"text":"J'y vais le midi car je travaille dans le coin.
Ambiance bistro
Le menu d'hôte est bon mais pas très copieux (j'avais encore faim après la saucisse et les frites..), et pas donné (16.95 il me semble)
Les autres plats sont encore plus chers
Le service est ok, pas exceptionnel
Le midi, on sent qu'il faut manger vite et partir vite car il y a du monde qui attend..
Bref, pas mal si vous êtes dans le coin, mais pas extraordinaire j'ai trouvé"}
{"text":"Food is excellent! Service was really efficient!! Terrace is very pretty!  Had a really great night!"}
{"text":"Technically well prepared food, but very average flavours and questionable plating. Le Grand Comptoir is an old-school French bistro, complete with older Frenchmen quietly chatting at the bar/back of the restaurant. The ambiance is casual and almost lethargic compared to the hustle and bustle of lunchtime Square Phillips. With Il Focalaio's fully packed terrasse next door, Le GC looked rather dead. Yet the service was attentive and food came fast. 

We ordered the Atlantic salmon, special of the day (pork ballotine), smoked salmon salad and veal sweetbreads. All dishes came with the soupe du jour, which was bell pepper potage. The soup was good, but quite peppery. The main courses were ordinary, with good ingredients, but underworked flavours. Side veggies were simply steamed, adding nothing to the dish. The rice was desperately bland. The portion of sweetbreads was huge, and with nothing to alleviate the richness of the fat, it was difficult to finish. The pork ballotine was well prepared, with the pleasant acidity of red fruits in the meat. But the rest of the plate (2/3 of it) was an uninspired layer of greens. The salad was actually the better half of the meal, with a generous portion of smoked salmon. 

Overall underwhelming experience, not really worthwhile. Some details in the service could easily be improved. E.g. using plated butter instead of pre-packed Saputo butter cups, or actually thinking of what side dishes could best complement each main course."}
{"text":"Very good bistro. They had a special menu of the day for $35 because it was Valentines day weekend. It was lovely fresh french food. I had a vegetable soup (puree) that was nice, hot and rich. Considering it was -11 that day it hit the spot. That was followed by the Escargot with artichokes. I have had Escargot at fancier places that tasted like dirt. These were nice and clean and the sauce was good enough to slurp off the plate when no one was looking. The entree was a pork tenderloin with salad and fries. The pork had a mustard sauce. The sauce was nice and rich as expected for french food and the pork was cooked well, just a little medium-well as it should be but it was not very favorable, maybe an herb crust or something to add some extra to it would be better. It was probably the low point of the meal but the sauce made up for it and I assume that was the intent. I finished with a mint tea and chocolate mousse. The mousse is made by the my server's wife (I assume he is the owner). It was everything I wanted in a mousse. This is not fancy french food but good old Bistro food and wonderful."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable price, and good service. would go back there again, next time when I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"Friends and I lunched at Le Grand Comptoir, a pleasant bistro in Phillips Square. The owner greeted us, seating us at a table by the window. 

Their menu is typical French but their cooking is anything but. To start, we shared a plate of escargot with artichokes (C$7.95), deliciously finished in a creamy sauce, and an order of the pate du jour (C$5.95). My pork cutlet was seasoned just right, was quite good, coming with a side of fries. I decided against wine[1].

Service at Le Grand Comptoir was great, and it's easy to recommend them for a satisfying French repast.

[1]I had imbibed copious drink the night before, so a glass of apple juice kept me company instead."}
{"text":"It was closed (looked like permanently - couldn't really tell....) there was no sign in the window explaining why they were closed, but we were pretty disappointed since we read the reviews on Yelp & hoofed it there with a long walk and no dinner at the end of our journey. Sad Face."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting and SO over-priced. Old lettuce in their salad, the ketchup bottles are dirty, old, and refilled. Not to mention the staff is so rude. Complete tourist trap. Don't go here."}
{"text":"I was with a group of Friends and our experience here was spectacular.  The Wait staff was so wonderful, the best I've experienced in a long time.  I had the Pasta of the day which was delicious, and shared a pitcher of Sangria with my Friends which was also very good.  We were seated on the Patio so we were able to enjoy the beautiful Summer day in Montreal.  One word; my favourite word; fabulous:-)."}
{"text":"Le Grand Comptoir.... un vrai délice!

I grew up going to this place every week.  At 10 years-old, I could hardly describe the foreign feeling happening on my plate...a perfect fusion of flavors exploded in my mouth. I couldn't get enough of the bavette with the side of fries and salad. 

Years later I understood. I had my first foodgasm at Le Grand Comptoir."}
{"text":"A good place to have affordable French cuisine. There is nothing fancy about this restaurant, food is good but nothing special."}
{"text":"OMG....you will never want to leave this place. if you order anything here....MAKE SURE ITS THE ESCARGOT.  you will think you died and went to heaven. The BEST I have ever had. Better than Paris."}
{"text":"I was seeking a solid authentic Montreal restaurant and the desired experience was delivered by the chef and staff. It was great to \"slow it down\" and enjoy time together, as well as a great meal."}
{"text":"Had a late Saturday night dinner here with a friend for my birthday. It's nice to have a relatively inexpensive French restaurant close to where I live when I know that Bonaparte in Vieux Montreal will cost you quite a bit more! Mon ami et moi both had the Entrecote (steak) Bordelaise served with a side of frites (fries), cooked veggies, and salad. It was very good. Service was attentive, sometimes a little too attentive. Since we arrived somewhat close to closing time, we felt somewhat rushed by our server. He kept coming to the table asking if we were ready to order and also near the end of the meal to ask if we were done. Granted, I had placed my napkin on my plate not realizing that that apparently signals that one has finished eating. In any case, this is a great little place and I will be back, probably with my folks who had wanted to eat here with me, but it was closed."}
{"text":"This was the second time I've been Le Grand Comptoir (the  first being 2 years ago) and the food and service was as good as I remember it.

This night I started with the escargot with artichokes with a cream sauce which were ok. I was actually expecting the escargot to still be in the shell which they were not so I couldn't help but think that they came from a can.  They did have a good flavor and were not rubbery so I was still happy.

The meal was accompanied by the soup du jour which was potato and leek which was really tasty.

I accompanied this with the house white as per recommended by the friendly waiter and it was a great combination.

For my main course I had the sirloin steak (medium rare) in a beajolaix (sp?) sauce which came with fries and a sald.  The steak was cooked perfectly and the fries were excellent.

I had the house red as per recommended and again it went perfectly.

The servers were extremely attentive and awesome.  

Definitely try it!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here for a few years, but the food was always a great bargain for the price - good French food at reasonable prices. I've liked all of their sauces that I've tried and companions have enjoyed the sweetbreads. I think they have a slightly more friendly/less intimidating vibe than a lot of nicer French places, too."}
{"text":"Nous sommes tombés par hasard sur ce petit bistro français sur la rue square Philipps caché entre d'autres petits restaurants. Nous allions initialement à la pizzeria mais mon père adore la cuisine française. Nous n'avons pas été déçus, plats simples mais savoureux, des portions assez généreuses, un service courtois. Plats quand même un peu dispendieux mais papa prenait l'addition ;) le décor devrait être rafraîchi, ne donne pas trop envie surtout pour une soirée en amoureux..."}
{"text":"We were staying at a hotel down the street and planned to have our first French dinner at this place.  We arrived about an hour before the posted closing time and upon arrival we were told they were closed.  We walked around the neighborhood looking for somewhere else and on the way back, saw new people being served, seated in the window, who hadn't been there before."}
{"text":"It was alright. But for the prices they have, I had expected something a little better. 
Tomato cream soup was good! The steak is so-so. 
Overall impression: not too bad but could be better."}
{"text":"Found Le Grand Comptoir through Yelp. I walked far far distances to dine here because of the reviews. haha

We ordered a half pitcher of sangria, the braised steak and the poutine. It was my first time having poutine duing this year's visit to Montreal so I was super excited.

With the meals, we got some sort of soup along with sliced baguette and butter. When our entree came, it looked great. The poutine however, was not as I remembered it from last year. The fries were thin, there was gravy but then just shredded Swiss cheese. I thought.....Hmm maybe it's just because its a different restaurant that I went to.  It was a big portion, so I couldn't finish it.

Service was wonderful. It was this lady who was very attentive and always had a smile on her face.

A tip I received: Later that evening, I went to a bar and the bartender told me to never go to a French joint for poutine and to get it some place else. So hint hint, go someplace else if you want the cheese curds with thick slices of potatoes."}
{"text":"Solid three stars for both service and food! Neither is too shabby, but it's still midrange. Decent selection of drinks as well. The portion sizes are actually really great, however, fries and salad are a bit 'over-featured' while the 'main parts' (protein) are small. The soup is pretty nice. The environment is that of an older cafe, and frequented by an older crowd, but it beats many other Montreal establishments (in that their fries are crisp (not soggy) and crunchy)."}
{"text":"I chose to eat at this place based on Yelp reviews, and also the fact that it is really close to the Centre Eaton and shopping area, which is where we were at the time. Le Grand Comptoir was just a quick walk away, and is located very close to the McGill Metro stop.

We were a little bit wary about entering the restaurant when we arrived around 7 pm, because there were only two other groups dining in there. The place was virtually empty on a Saturday night! We went for it anyways, and I guess the relative quiet ended up being a good thing, since we felt like the service was particularly attentive. The waiter/owner was very friendly.

The special of the night was cannelloni stuffed with veal for $15.95, so we ordered that. It came with a side salad. I ordered entrecôte (steak) bordelaise which came with fries and a little side salad, and my dad ordered grilled salmon. We shared an appetizer which was escargots with artichokes ($8.50) and came in a creamy sauce. I thought they were pretty good. The waiter originally told me that there would be 6 snails, but we ended up with 8. They were a good texture, not too chewy, not too hard. I ordered my steak medium rare and thought it was a tad overcooked, but not so bad that it was unpleasant to eat. The bordelaise sauce was interesting, it had kind of a sour undertone, and overall I thought my steak was okay. Not the best, but then again, this is a little French restaurant and not like a world-renowned steakhouse, plus it was only $22. The fries were fantastic though, they were thin and crispy, kind of like McDonald's fries but better. I couldn't stop eating them and my mouth is watering just thinking about them now.

The inside of the restaurant is really cute! They have tried really, really hard to give it a French vibe, with lots of photos of French landmarks i.e. Eiffel Tower, Montmartre, Notre Dame, etc. I would say they did a pretty good job, at least the decor and feel of the restaurant has a pretty French vibe! I fairly enjoyed my dinner here and wouldn't mind coming back if I was in the area again!"}
{"text":"Really great place that was vey reasonably priced. They were very accommodating with our large group. Food was very tasty Bistro style with very nice seafood. Steak and fries were ordered by a number in our group"}
{"text":"Great deck overlooking the square. The food is pretty good. The mustard pork tenderloin was highly recommended, but I can't rave about the smoked salmon salad. Should have gone with the Salade Nicoise instead."}
{"text":"The server was very attentive. We are outside(there is good outdoor seating). The food:
Bread with butter. Wait to dip that in the cold soup, which is delicious. The escargot with artichoke is also very good. Their cheese plate is okay, and their brownies are the BEST. 
If you want your steak to be a little pink, do the medium rare, not the medium, which has almost no pink. The fries are really good(you will have to ask for ketchup if you want any). Overall, I would definitely go to this restaurant again."}
