{"text":"Small hole in the wall restaurant. Saw this place when I was driving down Euclid. Read a review that mentioned Taiwanese food and I knew I had to stop by. Definitely a take out restaurant that is designed to cater to the CSU community. Parking is a pain.   The cook is Taiwanese, but can understand Cantonese. His son? who runs the front can speak mandarin. The menu is in both Chinese and English.   We tried the Taiwanese beef noodle, Taiwanese minced pork and rice, hot pot tofu with salty fish and chicken. The noodles were good, but definitely not the traditional noodles you would expect. The beef was tender, but the broth was not too impressive. The minced pork was good, but could do without so much corn starch. I prefer the traditional boiled tea egg vs the pan fried egg that came with the dish. The hot pot tofu dish was tasty. The tofu was firm and the salty fish was surprisingly not overwhelming. Ended the meal with a hot milk bubble tea. The tea was good (made from real tea leaves - option of black vs green tea), but the boba was not as soft as I would have liked. Pricey for the portions, but a must try. Not too often can you get Taiwanese food in Cleveland. Will prob come back to try other dishes on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great newly open Chinese restaurant! Very impressed with the authentic Chinese food from this local place."}
{"text":"Horrible experience and very dirty.  The buffet cart out front is just plain gross.  I have a few extra pounds and can count on one hand how many plates of food I have thrown out in my life.  I literally took two bites of food and immediately tossed in trash.  I had no clue what the meat actually was and very dry.  The food tasted like it had been reheated from yesterday."}
{"text":"Honestly I didn't expect to get authentic Chinese food in Cleveland, however the food actually tastes pretty good! Service was great too"}
{"text":"This place just opened and I finally tried it tonight. It was amazing! The friendly owner showed me pictures of his dogs while I waited for my food. I had the snow pea greens with tofu and it was divine. I'm a vegan and obsessed with greens so this really hit the spot. They cook all their vegetarian items on separate equipment which gave me peace of mind. I will be back to try more."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday afternoon about 4:30. To start with we were greeted at door nice... but we were told to only order from two sections on menu. After ordering and actually pointing to ordered items on menu we still managed to get 1 of 2 items we ordered. Getting what you order is first and foremost. Soups were ok. Fried rice boring. Again not getting what you ordered ruined the whole experience. Taste lower than your neighborhood take out."}
{"text":"Was so excited to visit the resto because of the reviews! And i ordered beef noodle and i was so dissapointed it was tasteless!! Well its cheap for 7 dollar i believe but i expected more! Ate 3 flavour chicken! My favourite dish too but tasteless still! No ginger and basil taste! Boba is ok quality! And they cook very slow too! Well its a great journey to visit ohio and tried tw food!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in to get some food on a whim - I ordered the General Tsou's chicken combo and ended up eating some of the best Chinese food I have had in a long while.  The chicken was perfectly lightly breaded instead of encased in the thick batter armor most Chinese places seem to do.  The sauce was not too sweet and had great flavor.   The food had great value for the price.  I plan on coming back for more."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here based on the hype and reviews by other Yelp users. The parking situation is not ideal but we were lucky enough to find an available street parking. We took a look at the menu and I ended up getting a combo of Shrimp Egg Foo Young + Fried Rice and my wife ordered some noodles with pork and squid + rice. They served the food within 15 mins but the problem was they gave my wife noodles with pork and squid.. without any squid. The lady at the cashier asked the cook what happened and he said they're out of squid. (Now they tell us!) It would have been nice if they informed us first before cooking the food and serving it. Other restaurants do it, I'm not sure why they didn't. To make matters worse, they gave me a bowl of plain white rice, when their menu clearly said I was supposed to get fried rice. We didn't want the food to go to waste so we just went ahead and ate it anyways. Not coming back here again.."}
{"text":"I have never written a review before, but my experience today was extremely disappointing. I've been here at least eight times, and this will probably be my last time here. I'm so so disappointed by the food and milk tea today. My first warning should have been none of the old staff here since they moved to their other branch Phusion Cafe (which is fantastic by the way).  Milk tea - Large pearl black tea. I asked for light ice and sugar. It came out tasting only of milk and no tea flavor. Extremely disappointed because I love milk tea and Ten Ren milk tea is one of my favorite milk tea stores. Boba was still good. I didn't feel like asking them to remake it.  - My two friends got Jasmine Milk green tea with pearls with light ice and sugar. Slightly better tea flavor, but mostly milk flavor. Still good boba.  Food - Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup. I ALWAYS get it when I come here. Why? Because it is my comfort food that reminds me of home since my mom makes fantastic beef noodle soup. This time, the soup (which is typically dark brown and flavorful) was bland and watered down to a light brown. The beef was still marinated well. - Minced Meat Rice. My friend always get this and both her and I were disappointed. The sauce is supposed to be slightly thick, but this time it was so watery. It was pretty much had no taste  with a weird sour aftertaste. Honestly, it seems like it may have just been premade and then reheated, but maybe kept in the fridge too long. - Kung pao Chicken. My Caucasian friend got this and even she couldn't finish half of her meal. The chicken was bone dry and had no flavor. The peanuts were not cooked well and tasted and crunched like just normal salted peanuts. The celery was literally mush in your mouth. The fried rice was extremely yellow and tasted so bad that I spat it out.  Service - We were ordering to eat at the restaurant, but had to pay first and order at the front desk. In the other times that I have been there, this was never the case. We were always seated, given menus, and paid at the end. I'm not sure if this is a new store policy or something. - The food also came out in takeout containers and takeout chopsticks despite the fact that we ate in the restaurant. I saw the Indian cashier take my take out container and pour it into a bowl before serving me. My friends still had take out containers though. It wasn't even close to closing hours too. - It honestly just felt like we had ordered takeout and ate at the restaurant instead.  I'm so so disappointed about my food and drink that it is almost hilarious. After this, I will be going to Phusion Cafe since most of their workers will be there and I won't risk the chance of having one of my favorite foods and drinks being bad.  EDIT After emailing Phusion Cafe, I was notified fairly quickly that there is no relation between China Sea and Phusion Cafe. They are separate restaurants and I will still be going to Phusion Cafe as China Sea has gone downhill."}
{"text":"Great place for a cheap and great tasting lunch. You get what you pay for. Not fancy. Buffet-esque. Food hot and fresh."}
{"text":"I went with a friend here based on the reviews and because I was craving milk tea.  We ordered:  1. Beef noodle soup - I guess they've changed things, since it looks nothing like the photos on Yelp. I wish I took a picture of it, but they're thin noodles (almost like spaghetti) and there's bok choy and cilantro. The braised beef was tender and flavorful. Overall, I actually liked this dish although the soup was a little watery. And I wasn't a huge fan of the noodles. But hey, I gotta give Cleveland some props for trying. This place is probably the best place for Taiwanese-style beef noodle soup in Cleveland.  2. Milk tea with boba - the tea flavor really comes through! Happy. My criticism of this was the boba. Half were appropriately chewy and the other half were a little hard. They need to stir the boba around more.  3. Pork chop with noodles - my friend and I did not expect this. Taiwanese style is usually deep fried pork chop with pickled mustard greens/veggies on the side. This was pan-fried over a bed of the same noodles used in the beef noodle soup. The vegetables were an assortment of sad-looking napa cabbage, carrots and mushrooms. Overall, the dish looked really unappealing. I didn't taste this.  4. Potstickers - again, it looked really unappealing. They looked like little fried nubs of dough. These tasted ok, but I can definitely make better. It confusedly came with broccoli on the side? I don't understand.  Disappointingly, when we got the bill, I found I had been charged $4.50 for the milk tea instead of $3.50. When I asked, the waiter had assumed I ordered the large instead of regular. Who does that?  Overall, this place is a hit or miss depending on what you order."}
{"text":"You have got to try the bubble tea! This place is literally the only place I've been to where the bubble tea is not just a concoction of sugar and milk. I've never realized that bubble tea would taste like tea! Another great thing is that they don't load up the drinks with ice! I hate that because it makes me disappointed in the quality of the restaurant.  The owners are also super nice and I'll be definitely back for more!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I think I expected a little too much from this place after hearing all the hype about it.   This restaurant is located in the center CSU, which means the parking situation sucks big time. Luckily,  we found some street parking on 21st street!  My first impression of this place was that it looked like your typical Americanized Chinese restaurant with buffet style trays at the front. And I guess China Sea is sorta like this, but it's also got some \"traditional\" Taiwanese food. I ordered the beef noodle soup, which is a classic traditional Chinese dish that rarely disappoints. Well, China Sea's version of it was just really disappointing. They put snowpeas in it and the noodles were curly!! What is this?? Also, the flavor was too freaking light. I literally put a bowl-full of hot sauce to make it taste somewhat bearable. Don't get this dish! Save your stomach for something yummier.  This is probably the only Chinese restaurant in the Cleveland area that sells Ten Ren tea. If you've been to LA/SF/NY/Asia, then you know how yummy Ten Ren is!! China Sea has a limited option of tea flavors, and they don't quite make it the way Ten Ren cafe does :/ buuuut it'll do for now! The tea is probably the only thing I'll come back for in the future!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I used to eat here all the time when it was in the old location in the Buckley building.  It was the go-to place when the weather was nasty.  They strike a good balance between \"fast food\" Chinese and traditional Chinese, offering speed and convenience without sacrificing too much authenticity.  The food is always of good quality with a nice, if somewhat predictable, selection on the buffet.  The buffet is priced by the pound so you don't feel like you have to pack your takeout box to the brim just to get your money's worth.  With a little practice, a normal person can take just the right amount of food to eat a full lunch for around $4-6 (via buffet by the pound).  The trick is in learning what's just enough without taking too much.  I especially like the peanut butter chicken, the egg foo young, the fried green beans, and the mushroom-pepper-chicken.  The owner is great, very friendly, usually laughing and making jokes.  I missed seeing him and the giant buffet when the old store closed, I'm really happy that the new store is still within walking distance of where I work."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch during Sparx City Hop 2014. Good, inexpensive lunch menu. Decent bubble tea. Got pepper steak lunch special, and bourbon chicken for the kids. Good preparation, veggies were crisp and fresh. Will be back to try dinner entrees."}
{"text":"Too much grease and salt on the food for a start as my experience started.  I tried their fish and fried rice deal along with a couple of vegetable rolls and by the time my meal was complete the roof of my mouth was covered with grease.  Normally this means the cook is not draining off food before plating it.    Too bad because their location is right across from my alumi matter, CSU and this would be a good place to buy some grub if it was not so greasy.    My indicator when it comes to Asian food is through things like vegetable rolls and in this case the two I ordered were served hard as a rock (overcooked) and very greasy.    Rice was cheap and dry and the few frozen vegetables were clearly microwaved and there were only a few peas and onions spotted.  Please drop the frozen vegetables or at least add something to your fried rice.  It's been seven hours since my time at China Sea by CSU and I am still trying to get the grease off the roof of my mouth.  It's all too bad because I truly loved the other location of this restaurant and was looking forward to some good eating."}
{"text":"Big fan of the restaurant. Very authentic Chinese food!  Strongly recommend: Sautéed deep fried Jade Toku & Fish! Hot & Spicy beef! Sautéed pork and squid with turnip!  And also the bubbbbbble tea! !Just amazing!!! The tea there is also great!   Another big pro: really large volume! Big plates! But fair prices! I went there several times. Every time I left with boxes :D  Forgot to say,it has board role-playing games! Nice place to hang out!"}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful owners!  I've eaten there 10-12 times over the last six months and haven't had a meal that wasn't outstanding."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant, have great tea time there, big fan of their Bubble tea and Tian Ren Tea......best Bubble tea in Cleveland,  mango, green apple, passion fruit, strawberry, litchi, peach and mango flavour .....all worth the taste!!!!!"}
{"text":"The worst boba i've ever had. Like a scoop of matcha, spoonful of half and half and the rest is straight up water. I was in a rush so there's room for error but he certainly took his time in not doing a good job. They're not a boba house so i can't blame them i guess...hope the food is better!"}
{"text":"Nice Taiwanese restaurant! I can find the Taiwanese food which I miss badly here. The bubble tea with tapioca is most recommended. I hope they could open another sub-store in Pittsburgh as well."}
{"text":"I used to frequent China Sea. It was amazing years ago but not anymore. Six months ago I got sick twice in the same month from eating it but since the staff is amazing and I work across the street I tried it again. Big mistake. My shrimp and lobster sauce tasted like soap and had mangled chunks of what I presume to be pork. I gave it a taste but man was it awful. Dry unidentifiable and stiff. The shrimp was twisted and hardly recognizable as shrimp and tasted like they soaked in laundry soap and salt. I couldnt finish. No matter how friendly and nice the staff is its not worth the risk again. Im only hoping not to be sick from whatever was in there. On a side note CSU has a very large population of those who don't eat pork. I find it disturbing the staff is ok with serving this to people. I watched him look in the container to verify and repeat the number. Not good. Gone are the days when I recommended this spot as a best kept secret. I wouldnt feed this stuff to stray cats."}
{"text":"When I entered the China Sea, I expected a mediocre Chinese fast food parlor; for the most part, this is what I got. There is a lunch \"buffet\" area where you can get a variety of food for $4.50 a pound, and lunch and dinner specials that are priced relatively the same as other fast food Chinese joints. The taste of the food is decent, but what really stands out is the amicable and congenial staff. Do expect a 3-5 min wait if you come during lunch hours."}
{"text":"Apparently, the owner takes off on Sundays (but the restaurant is still open).  This means that on Sundays, they don't offer anything from their authentic Taiwanese menu, and the restaurant transforms into an wholly Americanized Chinese place.  So if you are looking for authentic Chinese food, don't come on Sundays.  We've also come back a couple of times and tried a few different things.  They offer pretty delicious jade tofu dishes (with the soft, yummy tofu!) and pretty good three cup chicken.   The beef ho fun (beef with thick flat noodles) is on par with other Chinese restaurants in the area. The seafood hot pot wasn't as good.  Also, the bubble tea tastes different each time depending on who is making it on a given day.  It's still pretty good overall compared to Cleveland standards, but it varies from so-so to very good.  They also seem to run out of bubbles for their bubble tea quite frequently, especially if you are coming at dinnertime.  Everything else from my previous review still applies.  I still like the beef noodle soup despite the different noodle."}
{"text":"Try the food on their menu, that are some authentic Chinese/Taiwanese food. Good services, good food. Would definitely visit if stop by downtown Cleveland again."}
{"text":"Lots of great things on the menu. You have your traditional Chinese food but then so many other options. I highly recommend the beef noodle soup. All in all a great addition to Csu Campus."}
{"text":"Hip hip hooray! China Sea is back! (Used to occupy the location where Sung's House was).  After seeing the reviews of this place, I had to go try it. Good Taiwanese food? Why, oh yes, I must go.  Walked into this tiny restaurant off of CSU campus- luckily finding parking by the door.  Sat down and looked over the menu....and decided to go with the Taiwanese dishes. I'm not sure how they cook Chinese food, but hey, the Taiwanese food was quite good.  We ordered the Jade Tofu with fish, as well as the beef noodle soup.  The soup was good- not too sweet and the beef was tender and flavorful. (thumbs up!). The Jade tofu came out piping hot, and the fish were cooked quite well. (thumbs up). Service was fast- and while we waited, we played some card games behind us. Some of them looked kind of hard...so we opted for Uno. haha.  What made me really happy was that China Sea serves TenRen tea! YESSSSS! I heart TenRen tea. I walked in and was utterly surprised. Whatttt! Oh, that's good, i thought.  So, of course, I had to order some bubble tea. Got the kumquat lemon green milk tea, with some boba. Mmmmm. I was so happy the tea wasn't a mix of powder, sugar and something else- but that it was actually TEA. The boba was a bit too soft to my liking, but hey, it was pretty good and probably the best bubble tea I've had in Cleveland.   Would definitely go back to try some of the other dishes. I felt very at home at this restaurant too- definitely felt like...homey with some hot homecooked food coming out for dinner. :) Will definitely stop here again!"}
{"text":"I guess I was not too surprised by the bubble tea quality after I stepped in the store and after tasting the bubble tea, I was not too surprised by their food quality either.  bubble tea: many people seemed to have good things to say about their drinks but my opinion is: it is way too watered down. I could not taste any milk in it and a third of the drink was filled with ice. it was like drinking sweetened beverage rather than thick, milky bubble tea. the flavored teas were a little worse - I thought it was just smoothie but no they literally just added some condensed fruit juice or powder into their already bland milk tea. the bubble consistency was very good tho, good job. but man this bubble tea is way off.  food: we ordered minced pork over rice, hot and spicy two flavored beef, and salted fish with chicken and tofu hot pot. I have to say the pork over rice was probably the best among all. it is cheap, only $7. although it tasted a little different from what its suppose to be like, and Taiwanese people don't really put bean sprouts and snow peas and fried egg on top of this dish, but I'm in general happy with this one. one comment about their rice: it was so hard. it is obvious that they used left over rice and didn't heat it up properly. sigh.  the hot and spicy beef was way off again - the cut was too thick and the meat had a weird after taste. not sure if they didn't make it spicy enough to cover it or if the meat was not fresh.  the hotpot dish was ok, but it really didn't wow me at all.  parking: street parking is hard to find. you may get some luck with lot parking behind the restaurant. you will have to pay tho."}
{"text":"Cool spot for some fresh rice and chicken, prices are decent and customer service is awesome."}
{"text":"I knew that I had visit this restaurant after seeing the Cleveland Asian community reviewing and singing its praise. I sat down and was presented a menu with the familiar logo from their other locations. I was puzzled because this looked like typical Chinese-American food. I knew that they gave me the \"white people\" menu because of the Yelp pictures I saw of the real menu. So if you get a color menu, ask for the white menu. White meaning printed on white paper. The white people menu is on colored paper. Paradoxical and confusing. I met up with the legendary Young P who was also eager to try China Sea by CSU. There is something on the menu called Seafood Tanglement. I imagine a \"rat king\" or a mass of underwater creatures joined together at the fin. We went for the safe bets and ordered the pork, egg and rice. The spiced sliced beef was served cold and tasted just like roast beef deli meat. The bubble tea was very good. Not overly sweet and was a good compliment to the meal. I am glad I took the recommendation of Mao Yin."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this place for years and finally got to stop in for lunch, while picking up a package from Amazon, just one block over. China Sea is part of the Phuel/Phusion family of Chinese restaurants in Cleveland and while it had an extensive menu of Americanized dishes, it was the Taiwanese menu that I ordered from.   The chicken leg I had was deep fried and very tasty! The man cooking consulted the menu multiple times to see what exactly it was that I ordered and didn't seem confident that he was executing it correctly, which was a bit off putting. Unfortunately, this was reflected in the massive mound of mostly plain noodles served with the chicken, which were totally flavorless. I doctored it up with their homemade chili oil, but those noodles were still really lacking and could have used a sauce of some kind. Because of this, I'm left wondering if Phuel and Phusion do Taiwanese better at their other locations, and will probably skip a repeat visit here."}
{"text":"One word GARBAGE!  Never had worse food in 40 years. Dry, cold, greasy disgusting !   Server was non existent.  Dirty sticky tables. Cob webs on the lighting fixtures. I guess other reviewers didn't notice.  20$ later still hungry ."}
{"text":"This restaurant is just what the CSU area needed! While I was a frequent visitor at the former China Sea on Playhouse square, this location has refined and improved for what is needed in the on-campus area: quick, affordable, and good food.  I visited here for a quick lunch to-go today, and I was immediately impressed by the service. The owner was extremely welcoming, and willing to explain all of the options which they offered. The dining room was small and cozy, as I expected for the location. I kept it simple and ordered Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup with a Spring Roll and a Hot Black Milk Tea. My order was ready in 10 minutes, and my friend even decided to sample their \"buffet\" option (priced by the ounce) once he saw how fresh everything was. The price point is right- especially for the generous amount you are given. I was pleasantly surprised at the tenderness of the beef in my soup, and the noodles which weren't overcooked, as you often find at take out Chinese restaurants. The tea wasn't spectacular, but it was really reasonably priced (I think $2 for a small) and I'm eager to try other flavors The owner was eager to recommend other things, and even gave me a packet of his favorite hot tea to try.  I have to say I'm really glad to have something other than pizza and burgers to eat around CSU, and I'm even more glad to not have to deal with the terribly unpleasant service at CSU eateries. I'm definitely looking forward to returning for more!"}
