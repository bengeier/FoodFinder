{"text":"I visited on a Thursday evening, 7 pm. Menu seemed pricey but we wanted to give this place a try. Although the restaurant was only half seated, we had to wait a bit before being served. (Not sure if they were understaffed). The chef was polite enough to reassure us that it would just be a moment.   Tempura Udon - While super hot in temperature (which is an absolute plus), the shrimp and veggie tempuras were placed into the soup, causing for them to be extremely soggy as a result. Other restaurants place the tempura on a separate dish so if I ever come back, I'd probably request for this! The noodles were not too mushy and not too hard - a well balance.  Crispy Butter Roll - This came in a cute triangular roll, which was different. It was made of deep fried butter fish with oba leaf, yamagobo, cucumber, tobiko and spicy sauce (it wasn't spicy). However, it often fell apart easily if I took more than one bite, so it may be best enjoyed by taking one large bite!  Chicken Teriyaki Set - Quite pricey for the portion. Carrots were nice and soft, potatoes were a slightly dry, while the chicken was average. I can't say that it was worth the $23, when there are likely other restaurants that have a lower price without compromise of the quality.  Their service was fair. They were polite but it was difficult to get our server's attention when we needed them. Their washrooms were tidy, clean (with many mirrors!)  Would I come back again? Nothing urges me to do so strongly. To keep expectations realistic, Nami is not out-of-this-world outstanding."}
{"text":"Some of the best Sushi I've had has been on business trips.  Nami was no exception.  The food was incredible, and the environment was warm and inviting.  They have traditional secluded booths for privacy, and the service was attentive.  If I venture back to Toronto, I'm definitely coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good place to try various Japanese dishes that are not too westernized or improperly prepared Nami is THE place to go... Nami offers good ambiance with western style seating for the rookies or the contemporary version of the Japanese seating on the floor with the cheat hole underneath for a comfy tour du Japon....  But what is most notable in this Korean owned but Japanese staff'ed pearl is that it offers quite a fresh variety of Japanese originals  such as :  TRADITIONAL and exquisitely fresh sushi and sashimi ferried by their famous love boats.... Moist and perfectly grilled assortment of seafood (more on this)  THE BEST nabe yake featuring too many to count seafood types in this soul comforting broth with udon noodles  AND FOR the more adventurous the Dish of the Day featuring a rotation of Japanese originals.....  The best time to visit this place is lunch because they offer the Robata Special... Robata Special literally translates to food found in carts near Train Stations in Japan... This consists of a seafood (choose from the iced display showcasing fresh red snapper, mackerel, tuna, salmon, squid, etc) that is grilled to a perfection keeping the meat moist... This comes with a miso dressing salad, miso soup, rice, and undoubtedly the best udon in T.O......All for less than $20  And if you still have space left... you can venture yourself in green tea ice cream or black sesame seed ice cream..... If you do try the black sesame ice cream.... Make sure you stick your tongue out to your friends.... :-P  Of course the Robata special is available at dinner as well but at a premium price....  Their selection of hot pots is great and their Beef Amiyaki cubed and cooked on the table are not only delicious but quite a fun experience...  If you'd like to try quality Japanese food but can't make yourself to seat for a 16 hr flight... drive down to Nami..."}
{"text":"After eyeing this restaurant for ages, I finally had a chance to go there to celebrate a friend's birthday. Things looked up when we got seated in one of the private rooms in the back, which felt more like a lounge with a table that sits at floor level and you sit in the floor, but your feet and legs are below the table. Pretty cool.  The food was ok, but nothing to write home about. My date and I had the Love Boat course menu (minimum 2 people) and our expectations were high. Unfortunately the food was pretty average, but way below what you would expect for these prices. The portions were small and after dinner I was still a bit hungry - and I'm not a big eater.  Service was good with the servers going out of their way to cater to our large group, but the whole experience was eclipsed by just ok food. I may try it again, but with so many other sushi options, it'll be a while."}
{"text":"another Chinese run \"high end\" Japanese restaurant.  Try hiro or ematei, much better quality and service.  check out the actual food/drink to make sure it is what you ordered.  we ordered large sake and was given a small one, waiter did not want to correct the error initially.  took me some hard work to get it resolved.  then we ordered premium sushi dinner and was provided regular sushi dinner, a Chinese lady \"manager\" came and told us it is almost the same and refuse to change.  I would expect better food and service at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I expected a lot coming here, given the average 4 star review.  I was pretty disappointed with my experience.  For two people, we ordered the BC tuna sashimi, black cod, love boat and an ice cream each.  The BC tuna was fresh... Melted in my mouth! The black cod was very good as well; buttery without being too greasy.  The love boat had a ton of stuff: assorted sashimi, sushi, maki rolls, salmon teriyaki, fried chicken tonaksu (spelling?) and of course miso, salad and fruits. I expected a lot more since the love boat alone was a hefty $39/person.  The fish was not super fresh,  the portions sound like a lot but really wasn't, and the fruits were kind of stale!  Ice cream is ice cream (got green tea and black sesame- you can't really go wrong with these).  Overall it was okay but definitely not the best sushi I've had.  Also based on the reviews and prices I expected a lot more."}
{"text":"I love this place - I came across Nami when I was doing a search for best sushi restaurants in Toronto.  I have probably been here over 15 times in the last year and a half.  The service is great, the food is amazing and the seating is really cozy.  Love having an entire section to yourself, its private, it just makes the entire atmosphere.  The sushi pizza here is amazing!"}
{"text":"After reading all of the wonderful reviews on Yelp, I thought Nami was going to be a good experience - boy, was I ever disappointed!  While I appreciate the \"traditional\" Japanese ambiance, this place was simply run-down and uninspiring.  The service was slow and they got my order wrong, even though we talked about it in some detail as I made a few changes, given my allergies. The food was overpriced. The miso soup was tasteless, the shashimi was not fresh or tender, and the teriyaki beef was nothing to write home about. Hands down, Nami is one of the worst Japanse restaurants I have been to, since arriving in Toronto."}
{"text":"I'd have to say Nami is the sexiest sushi joint in the city.  It's super exciting and slick as far as sushi spots go. And it's great for groups. There's two bars and waiter service.  This is definitely the kind of place that you take fancy clients to impress them. It's not cheap that's for sure, and they do put mayo on a lot of stuff which is always my meter of how authentic a sushi place is. The more mayo, the less Japanese.  But like I said, you go here for the character, not the cut of fish."}
{"text":"My friends and I were contemplating between Terroni and Nami (the restaurant with the black exterior, next to Terroni). We decided to go for Japanese and ended up at Nami, which I kinda regret.  After reading over the menu, we decided to order a bunch of items for the four of us to share. We started with the Kaiso salad - Three different kinds of seaweed, served with crab leg, thinly sliced cucumber and house dressing ($8.95). This isn't the typical seaweed salad you get at most other Japanese restaurants. It came with 3 different kinds of seaweed and really lacked flavour (even with the house dressing). I much prefer the regular seaweed salad over this. The crab leg also didn't really add much to the dish.  The next dish we ordered was the Beef sashimi - New York Strip (US Black Angus) seared to perfection, then sliced paper thin. Served with ponzu sauce and ground radish ($10.50). When it came, I didn't think it looked very appetizing...nor did the taste really change my mind. It tasted okay with the ponzu sauce, but overall just an okay dish.  We also ordered the Nasudengaku - Deep fried eggplant topped with chef's own sweet miso sauce ($8.95). Finally, a dish I really enjoyed! The skin was crispy on the outside and the sweet miso sauce was amazing. However, at 9 bucks, it was a little steep for two pieces of eggplant.  Since we also wanted to try a roll, we decided on the Spider roll - Deep fried soft shell crab with avocado, mayonnaise, cucumber and flying fish roe ($17), which came with 8 pieces. It was pretty tasty, but I found it to be a bit overpriced.  Since one of my friends wanted to try one of the hot pots, we ordered the Sukiyaki hot pot - Thinly sliced US Black Angus cooked in a sweet soy sauce based soup with hakusai cabbage, green onions, spinach, shiitake and enoki mushrooms, tofu and udon noodles. Served with raw egg for dipping. The price of this is $33 per person (with a minimum order of two people, and orders have to be taken before 10:15pm). Since we had ordered several other dishes, we requested two servings ($66). It was my first time trying sukiyaki, and I really enjoyed it! The sweet soy sauce was nice and gave the food a great flavour. However, for $66, we didn't get very much food, and again felt it was overpriced.  Overall, I wasn't very impressed. I felt for the most part, the food was overpriced. For those prices, I expected much better."}
{"text":"Bad food poor service and the waiters can't speak well not coming back"}
{"text":"Very authentic Japanese restaurant, their fish is very, very fresh, but their customer service could be a little bit better."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 5 yrs consistently for their Robata Lunch Special. It comes with your choice of grilled fish, skewers or Udon noodles. A great value for lunch and absolutely delicious.   I also highly recommend their Hamachi and green onion roll. Their black sesame ice cream is also very good.   Knocked off one star - while I feel their sushi/sashimi is good, for the price I feel the fish can be higher quality."}
{"text":"Funny thing about this place is that people refer to the place as high end but when you walk in, the decor is very traditional and almost in need of a reno. We went there during a week day so it was not busy. We were able to get a table right away after we found parking for $10 flat fee in the area.  We decided to order the Tuna tataki which was soooooo good. Very flavorful.  We also wanted to order the Sushi Spring Roll since it looked really good in the photo and a fresh fish from the Robata bar however we had chosen to order other items on the menu so there was already too much food. We ordered the spider roll (8 pieces for $17) which was tasty.  We also ordered Uni and Yellowtail a la carte. The fish was fresh and flavorful.  Overall a good experience. The only thing is that we left still pretty hungry, though the bill was only $50 + tax and tip since we ordered sparingly."}
{"text":"3/5! Recommend the sushi spring roll and the sashimi. The rolls had too much rice for my liking. Great location!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with their chef special. It costs more than what the chef provided. We can get exactly the same kind of sashimi at way lower price somewhere else."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian, so I hope other folks like myself will take note...  while the selection for vegetarians is not wide ranging (if, like me, you avoid things like fish broth as much as possible) but is more than adequate and tasty.  First, my waiter did not fully speak English or get what I was saying, but he understood enough to go and ask the kitchen several questions on my behalf, which is always greatly appreciated.  To start I had the edamame and pickles, both of which tasted great, were fine portions and came very quickly. I also had a green salad that wasn't much to talk about, I'd say it was a step below the simple green salads you might find in any sushi place.  I had the \"veggie\" roll which is cucumber and avocado - it was quite tasty and nicely sized - 6 pices, lots of 'cado. The soy sauce, ginger and wasabi were nothing spectacular but not bad by any means.  I topped off this gargantuan meal with the mixed mushrooms from the grill with the \"BBQ Rice Ball.\" Both were kind of bland and I would have enjoyed more butter on the mushrooms. Using their house sesame sauce helped the taste but for such a large portion, more flavor would have been great.  All in all, I rather enjoyed the meal. I would probably get more sushi next time, but was pleased."}
{"text":"Go to Ki if you want a bar scene, brush elbows with traders, and overpriced but good sushi. Nami is low key with quality rolls and sashimi. The sushi pizza is...interesting and perhaps an acquired taste. Stick with the inside out rolls on the back cover of the menu.  Bottomline: quality sushi, definitely try the sesame ice cream!"}
{"text":"Nami is the go-to place for my business Japanese lunches. This time around, we were seated in front of the grilling station which made the meal slightly more entertaining (tho I liked the booths more).  I ordered   a) Chirashi - it was fresh but I could not stand the minced ginger in my rice. BLOODY HELL - I HATE GINGER. I was picking at my rice and making a mess of it all. The fish was fresh but that was about it. I prefer both the seasoning of the egg and rice at Japango more (where the lunch Chirashi is also about 5$ cheaper). I think the fish at Japango was more varied as well but I did not take a pic (stupid me).  b) Green Tea Cheesecake - I don't know. The last time I was here, the cheesecake was creamy and fresh. This time around, it tasted stale and crusty. I could barely finish it. The red bean filling was also meh.   Overall, the ambience was good. The service was impeccable. If you have an expense account, by all means - go here. I am sure I will return (the bosses like it) so I hope my next round isn't as bad. I will keep y'all posted. Side note: I do recall eating the rolls here and liking it."}
{"text":"The quality was decent here but I don't know if it was worth the price. Maybe I just had high expectations because of the other reviews I've read. I ordered the salmon sushi pizza and the spicy tuna roll. Presentation did not match the 'high quality'. Also, there was a little too much rice and too little spicy tuna in my roll.  Service was attentive and the waitresses were also dressed in traditional kimono garments, which just adds to the 'authentic' Japanese feel.  Overall, I'd stick with a 3/5 and I wouldn't come back strictly due to pricing."}
{"text":"Superbly prepared sushi, friendly efficient service and fun ambiance. The secluded booths are great for business meetings and outings with friends. The sushi spring roll is a classic - awesome.  The fresh mushrooms steamed in foil are amazing. Strongly recommend the entree option to just let the chefs make whatever sushi/sashimi they recommend. Have done this a few times with a group of four and solo. It never disappoints. The price is always reasonable and you'll venture out into new delicacies beyond the delicious spicy tuna roll."}
{"text":"Sushi Pizza, Little Neck Clams on the grill with a splash of sake, Black Cod, Yakatori with sesame sauce...impeccable service....just a few of my favourite things!! Ever!!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this restaurant for  a while and glad I did. The quality of the food exceeded my expectations! You can also find dishes you normally don't find at the more common Japanese places. First I thought it seemed pricey, but when I experienced the quality and freshness of my meal, it was worth every cent."}
{"text":"A very special restaurant for personal reasons, bias aside, this Japanese restaurant has extremely fresh fish!  We routinely make the trek to Nami for some tasty sashimi. The yellowfin was especially good.   The chirashi was excellent as well with a variety of fresh fish and pretty decent rice.   There are excellent, private booths that are available, I highly recommend these for special occasions (they can seat 4 comfortably).   Costs are more expensive than you would find at New Generation or Sushi on Bloor but it is reflected in the quality of the fish.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"One of the few real authentic Japanese restaurants in the city. They seemed to have recently changed their menu, which is disappointing, as I actually enjoyed their variety of small dishes.  Their grilled items can be a bit expensive, but they are fantastic. Their staff is very friendly. Similar to all these other restaurants downtown, it can be a bit hectic during lunch hours, and I would highly recommend going there for dinner and enjoy the vibe and try on different dishes. Their sushi and sashimi is also very good. The place is not cheap, so be prepared to spend some money."}
{"text":"Sashimi was quite fresh. Japanese style hot pot was kinda bland. Wouldn't come again as at the same price u can find better places in Toronto."}
{"text":"The sushi bar at Nami isn't the greatest, I have had better. When it comes to Japanese, I am very critical. The way I test a sushi bar is by ordering Uni Sushi and Ikura Sushi, and let me tell you, the Uni was NOT fresh!! I was seriously disappointed by it and the Ikura wasn't that great either. But I have to say that their freshly grilled fish and seafood was very impressive. If you sit at the bar, the chefs will grill it right in front of you as you order. If it wasn't for the fresh grill bar, I would have given this place a 2 star. The next time I'm there, I will stay clear of the sushi and order from their fresh grill menu."}
{"text":"I lived in Toronto for 16 years and Nami's will ALWAYS be my favorite restaurant! I'm now living in Chicago but I really really miss Nami's sushi pizza! I used to stop for lunch and get 2 sushi pizza's to go and eat an entire one on the way home and share the other one with my husband. Nami's sushi pizza would be my last meal before I die! I wish someone would send me a couple, I'm dreaming about them as I'm writing this review. Nami's is a wonderful restaurant and the biggest reason I miss Toronto! 5 wonderful stars!!"}
{"text":"Nami is delicious. Fresh fish, awesome atmosphere, very authentic set up and vibe. The restaurant is set up like any fancy izakaya in Japan, open space and private booths. I loved being sat in the private booth. I always order the chirashi don because Ii feel like it is more bang for your buck. Suki was my server last time and she was very friendly and attentive. You can dress up or dress down for this place, not pretentious at all. The spring sushi roll is deliciousss, the crunch in it is awesome - I highly recommend ordering it as an app."}
{"text":"I have been to Nami twice in recent months and am unfortunately withdrawing my 5 star rating. The beer was stale and the sushi was no fresher than what you can get on College West on a Friday night for a lot less money. A great disappointment."}
{"text":"I chose Nami as my first review on Yelp since I absolutely *love* the place! :)  I first went to Nami exactly 5 years ago on a date with my boyfriend. At first, I was a bit surprised as the prices were a bit higher than what I was used to in B.C., but I found that the quality of the food was (and still is) well worth the higher price.   Being of Japanese descent, I am extremely picky with sushi and after having been to 20+ 'Japanese' restaurants in Toronto over the last 5 years, I can safely say that Nami is the only sushi restaurant that I love and would highly recommend to anyone. In fact, whenever my family comes to visit, I bring them there and they are equally impressed!   My favorite signature dishes are the sushi spring roll (love this!), the negitoro roll, the unagi roll and the mixed appetizer tempura. I have also tried several of their main dishes such as the salmon teriyaki dinner, but I generally stick to my favorites.   Another thing I would like to rave about is the 5-star sushi presentation that you will receive at Nami. Again, no other sushi restaurant that I have been to in Toronto spends so much care and passion in the presentation of their dishes. A lot of restaurants forget that sushi is an ART form in Japanese culture, and everything from the way that the sushi is placed, to the size of the sushi roll itself and the amount of ginger on the sushi board is important! Every time that I go (and I have been over 30 times in 5 years), I am impressed and I walk away extremely happy.   In terms of attire, I don't have any qualms about walking in with jeans and a t-shirt. At the same time, it is the kind of place where you can wear a cocktail dress/stilletos or for men, a suit, and you would still not feel overdressed. It is a *perfect* date venue if your boyfriend/girlfriend/husband/wife loves excellent-quality sushi!   If I had to say one negative thing about this restaurant, it is that if you are sitting in a booth whether it is inside the main floor or towards the front entrance/exit, it may take a bit longer to flag down a waitress since you are not really in their line of sight. We never have this issue when we are sitting at a regular table on the main floor. On the other hand, there is more privacy when you are in a booth - it's certainly, much more romantic/intimate! :)"}
{"text":"Living in Ottawa for a few years and only having access to the Ottawa sushi scene, I felt like sushi was something I had not eaten in years.  Nami has always been one of my favourite places in TO.  It's more expensive than most places but it's also really good.  I've been here a handful of times and the food is always delicious and always fresh.  Price aside, it has good food.  This meal we had miso soup, beef sashimi, tuna sashimi, salmon sashimi and various sushi and rolls.  The things I remember most about the meal was how much I liked the  beef sashimi, how fresh the fish was and how nice our server was.  The salmon was good but the tuna was fantastic!   I'll make sure I don't wait another year or more to drop in next time."}
{"text":"Sushi is good and the fish is fresh, but the seaweed for my hand roll was rather soggy - a bit disappointing, considering prices are above average.   Tempura udon is an OK size for me, but someone with a heartier appetite will find themselves needing a bit more.   Maybe I'm being unfair, and didn't order enough dishes to give a real test of Nami. I could've sworn it was better a couple years ago...   On the plus, seating is comfortable, service is OK, and Nami's could be a nice and quiet enough spot for a date night!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with traditional food as always.  I will return again.  The first time for me being here is Winterlicious, when they have the sake dessert (the closest thing I can get before finishing work).  After that I tired to go every Winterlicious/summerlicious every year and also regular days.  I have tried the sushi bento and other stuff, very fresh and well prepared as always.  Today we went there at lunchtime to celebrate mom's birthday.  Food was great.  We ordered from the grill the first time.  I love fatty salmon grilled and lightly salted.  The skin is lightly crispy with oil that goes well with rice.  Mom ordered grill set B: the black cod with chicken skewers.  I ate one of her skewers and loved it!  I have the chicken teriyaki bento.  In addition we also ordered the grilled sweet potato.  At the end we ordered too much food and we did not have room for the special dessert they have prepared for my mom.  It was nice of them, but I don't want to be wasteful.  It is the gesture that counts. :)  The service was great.  The waitresses wear kimono cute custom.  5/5.  The ambience is traditional Japanese and they even have the samurai armour at the door, if you are into those things.  The bathroom is clean.  (Yea I have a thing to check out all restaurant's bathroom).  I will be back."}
{"text":"I love it here.  Let me provide some context. I regularly travel to Tokyo and I have had wonderful sushi and have eaten in tons of restaurants in Japan. The challenge for a Japanese restaurant in Toronto is not a challenge of authenticity. The challenge is that so few customers actually are interested in authentic Japanese food. Instead they are are more interested in the tasty western fusions, such as rolls, and the like.  I'm not saying their taste is wrong and it is hard to condemn a restaurant for serving what customers want, but I think it is unfair to condemn a place for not being authentic when the demand is more Canadian than Japanese.  Tonight I sat at the sushi bar and ordered omakase, and I asked for it Japanese-style, rather than rolls.  It was fabulous. Several of the wonderful fish selections were flown in from Japan and everything was exquisitely prepared.  It was like being in Tokyo again. This is a fantastic place and where I will return next visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"You ever watch those movies where the yuppie takes the dumb blonde to a ultra expensive sushi restaurant, and it's followed immediately with the sex scene? Well, this is that restaurant. Except, in this case..I was the dumb blonde, and there will be no sex.  The staff here are Japanese, which means the food is authentic, and the directions they give you over the phone is..authentically Japanese, let's just say. I came here for a very light dinner prior to heading to the Opera, and I only ended up here because my Bay Street friend recommended the place. I was immediately greeted by a Samurai statue at the front door, which is very cool, but a little bit creepy, and perhaps unnecessary. An old Hon Kong horror film entailed a Samurai resurrecting to a zombie and terrorize a town made an impression on me as a child, and ever since I've been wary of Samurai armour. The waitresses here all spoke Japanese, and wore fake kimonos, which was sightly entertaining. The entire restaurant greets you including chefs as you take your seat.  I immediately noticed the outdated furniture. It wasn't like traditional outdated, but just old. The lighting was perfect, as it somehow made the experience of dining more engaging. I left the ordering to my friend, as she had been here before, and the pictures on the menu was not extensive.  They have booths for groups of four, and two elevated section where you dine the Japanese way, on your knees with no chairs. It looked very uncomfortable. I don't like discomfort when I eat. Between eating your with hands on a banana leaf and eating on your knees, I'd take the hands method any day.  My interest directed towards the patrons. This literally felt like the foreplayground of Bay Street. As I looked around, it seemed sex was on everyone's agenda. Pairs of the opposite sex that you just knew wasn't a couple.   The food came. I had no idea what I ate, but it was bloody good. The more authentic and unrecognisable the food got, the more delicious it was. I really enjoyed the mushroom dish. I thought it was a very light but satisfactory dinner, my friend thought it was heavy--she was a third my size.. My friend offered to pay the bill, but did it in a way where I knew I couldn't convince her otherwise. So for the first time in my life, I didn't argue to foot the bill..she may have been a women, but her position in her bank demanded reverence. I guess I got a reverence for Bay Street. It was expensive, I suppose you can say that it's worth the money, only if you're getting laid afterwards.   Nami has more than enough funds to renovate the space, and the owner should really consider updating a few details. Like keeping the entrance to the kitchen less conspicuous, or invest in a wine cellar, instead of keeping the dozen bottles of Yellowtail in a display fridge by the entrance like it were some kind of convenience store. Food alone; perhaps the best Japanese Restaurant experience I've had in Canada so far, honestly. I think I ate some kind of brains, but I love brains, so it's all good.  And tone down the AC, I spent a good portion of the night trying to keep that sheet of paper from blowing off of my table. You know, that sheet of paper you get in some restaurants to coaster your plate? Yeah, this restaurant had many characteristics of a shabby place, but it just isn't, and that's annoying.  \"May I take that plate?\" \"No please don't, I need it as a paper weight!\""}
{"text":"Unagi Don!!!! Pricy place but you can taste the quality. A definitive must try!!!  Great atmosphere and the service is on point."}
{"text":"If only Nami wasn't downtown - that's the only complaint I have.   Intro. My parents and I have been going to Nami for a very, very long time. We are pretty adventurous when it comes to food and will always try new and different restaurants, but somehow, we go to Nami time and time again. The restaurant can get pretty busy so we always ask to sit at the booth...we cannot imagine sitting in the middle area so close to your neighbours that you can hear their conversation more than yours.   The only booth we don't like is the one that is shared, usually for two people, but it still is a booth.   Food. What can I say but yummy! My favorite dishes are the karioge (fried white fish), agedeshu tofu, beef sashimi, California hand rolls, and a selection of sashimi including tako, toro, maguro, and mirugai - and that's just appetizers. Then for main course it really depends on my mood but I love the grilled fish dishes such as gindara or salmon collar (hamachi). The beef terriyaki is not bad either.   Me and my amour have tried the shabu shabu which is a fun way to enjoy a variety of foods cooked in a pot in front of you (includes vegetables, rice and noodles). The dinner ends with black sesame seed ice cream, which although tastes soo good, does stain your teeth and tongue black (FYI, not a good first date dessert).   Ambiance. Great. I go to Nami for the food not the decor so as long as I have my booth I know I am good.   All in all, you can count on the quality and freshness of the dishes which is very important considering we are dealing with raw foods. I have never been to Japan so I cannot comment on how authentic the food is, but it has never let my parents and I down."}
{"text":"Went with a huge table and we ordered just about everything. It was OKAY.  Tons of way better sushi/Japanese places in Toronto. Also I should note their rolls selection here is really lacking.   Everything we had was pretty average including the sushi pizza everyone raves about (maybe because I've had way better). Fire grilled beef was not a tender cut of beef and lacked any depth of flavour. Sashimi was average in freshness. I was surprised the uni sushi was pretty fresh. Oh and the black cod was good. Spicy Scallop hand roll was also good. Those were the only things worth mentioning. My table also ordered grilled lobster and love boats... Nothing worth mentioning.   Overall just decent. Goos service though. Enough to go back? Nope."}
{"text":"This place is going on my blacklist!!  What's wrong with all these yelpers and their taste for Japanese food? Or Am I the weird one here? Honestly....4 stars?  Let me start by saying I did give this place 3 full tries. Each time ordering something new from the menu. Its a very convienent place for me to drop by since its so close by to my neighbourhood.   Disappointing....  1st time I went here I ordered the usual benchmark Japanese food. Sashimi platter, Kaiso salad and some makimono rolls etc. Let me say, for the price paid it is definately NOT worth it. Be prepared to be hungry afterwards. The portions are small and the fish is comparible to any AYCE japanese place, except you can't order more. We also ventured out and decided to order the SUSHI PIZZA, which in my opinion should be renamed sushi FEETsa. It smelt like my feet after a week of going camping with one pair of socks. It was also rock solid and each bite I thought my tooth was going to crack. ALL these people raving about it are either working there, knows someone that works there or have no taste buds or sense of smell. (Sorry if I'm being harsh)  the 2nd time I came here we hesitated but didn't feel like cooking ourselves and gave them the benefit of the doubt. I ordered the Zosui and my gf ordered the Nabeyaki udon. they were both Meh. My rice was pretty damn soggy. almost like a risotto but far more bland. How can you screw this simple dish? *sigh* My gf's order was ok but for $16 bucks premium it was as satisfying as bowl of instant noodles with ingredients bought at any chinese grocery store.   And the 3rd and FINAL time we came here (recently) was the final straw. We order the Shabu Shabu hot pot. Which we were craving for since last week we had an awesome chanko nabe. the verdict: IT was flipping HORRIBLE! The soup base came out as plain tap water with a seaweed floating in it. The ingredients provided were slices of beef (bought at any T&T I presume) and the rest were an assortment of various veggies. for $38 bucks a person.. c'mon now.. I honestly felt like I was on some \"Punk'd\" show and Ashton Kutcher was going to come out with a camera crew after I paid for this.  Nami, We gave you 3 tries. Each time an utter disappointment. My humble apologies NAMI you are officially on my blacklist.  The one star I give this place is for the service. It was actually quite good."}
{"text":"First let me qualify what my sushi standards are. I've eaten at about 50 restaurants in Japan, from subways to the best at Tsukiji. I wanted to try Nami because it is established, has quite a lot of good reviews, and I'm not yet familiar with many Toronto Japanese restaurants.  The short review. Don't go to Nami.  While on the surface it has many Japanese touches, these don't run very deep. The cheap wooden chopsticks and lack of oshibori should be a dead give away that this is not really a premium restaurant and all the little customs are missing from the service staff.  We ordered a very standard meal, tsukemono, seaweed salad, miso, nasu dengaku (which they were out of), as well as beef sashimi and the chef's sushi selection (15 pieces).  First, the tsukemono tasted like it was out of a can, like it was old. it had none of the usual light, fresh vinegary taste. It was rubbery and disgusting. The seaweed salad was okay, but the miso dressing tasted and looked like soy sauce mixed with oil. It was quite unflavourful and had a weird texture.  The miso soup was obviously missing the proper ratio of dashi and tasted thin and flavourless.   The beef sashimi was okay, although again, flavourless and somehow too dry for raw meat.  The sushi, (which is the really important part to me) was in part better than the appetizers, with the salmon, tuna, hamachi and other common fishes being okay - 7/10 for Canada standards. However the \"difficult\" fishes such as octopus and ika were nearly inedible. One fish, which I couldn't even identify, was so bad, as soon as I put it in my mouth I knew that it was off and I should have spit it out. For this kind of price I regret not making a fuss with the staff.   Long story short, this meal cost more than any sushi meal I've had in Toronto and could easily be surpassed by a good train station meal in Tokyo for 1/3rd the price. This is really a disappointing effort considering how they bill themselves. The chefs should be ashamed."}
{"text":"Upon entering the restaurant, it just had expensive written all over it. Luckily, the company was paying and the guy who was ordering for us was Japanese so he sure knew what to order.  I give this place 4 stars because it was here that I had my first taste of toro which basically ruined all other sushi for me. At around 10 bucks per piece there was no way I'd be paying from own pocket but damn, even if i did, it would have been worth it. If I ever visit japan again i'll make sure to save up for an order of premium toro.  I have come here several times after just for sushi and its safe to say it really is a quality sushi restaurant, though I find the pieces to be a bit small. Only lunch for me too coz the prices practically double in the evening."}
{"text":"This is the type of quality of experience, ambiance, and finally food that makes over ordering so very easy to do. It had been a while for my wife and I to have a night out, as well as sushi. Our original date night plan was different, the past week was trying, we reset and decided on sushi. We've been here a couple of times previously and it always consistently excellent, not good, not okay. Excellent!  We started with the tempura appetizer, my favourites are the shrimp and asparagus. Cold soba noodles, yakitori with teriyaki. We had to order two orders as my wife didn't want to share her two skewers. My wife ordered the grilled mackerel and sardines as her main. I had Japanese Amberjack, Saba, and the Ankimo sashimi. We spilt the Hokkaido scallop, Botan Ebi and the tamales in the head are the best part, Zuwaigani. All of it was totemo oishi!  We arrived post-rush and as such the uni from Hokkaido was sold out. Drat!  Thank you Nami, we'll be back for the chef's selection and robata."}
{"text":"Came here because I had a mad craving for sukiyaki. Ordered 3 portions for 4 people to eat. The food portions were more than enough for us. The waitresses were dressed up in kimonos and extremely attentive. Ice cream was served at the end of the meal. My brother had a very unique tasting vanilla ice cream, which was the best flavor of all. Will be coming back if I'm in town again to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"I live in los angeles and dream of nami so good! the grilled giant prawns and mixed veggies are soooooo good"}
{"text":"I'll just start by saying that this is one of my favourite Japanese restaurants in Toronto.  The ambience is nice, not too loud, and has a nice traditional Japanese feel to it. Service is friendly and fairly attentive if a bit slow, although it can be a bit harder to flag down a server if you're sitting in a booth.   Their food has been consistently good every time I've gone. In my opinion, some of their highlights are their sushi spring roll, tempura (their batter is light and crispy without being overly dense or oily), rolls/sushi in general (good selection of both more traditional and modern maki, along with fresh fish), and their robata grill - if you choose to sit at the robata bar you can see your food being prepared in front of you (definitely try their black cod).   One of Nami's specialty dishes is their sushi pizza, which seems to be a dish unique to Toronto. I've seen variations of this at Japanese restaurants all over the GTA and not in any other city I've been to, but Nami's sushi pizza is definitely the best - it's a crispy rice cake topped with salmon sashimi, green onions, tobiko, and a mildly spicy sauce.   They don't have a big selection of desserts, but their green tea creme brulee is pretty good, as is their black sesame ice cream.   Nami definitely caters to the business crowd and their prices reflect that, but overall, I'd say Nami is definitely one of the best places for good Japanese food in Toronto hands down."}
{"text":"Nami is a pretty old and established Japanese restaurant in Toronto. It's been around since I've been old enough to know about Japanese restaurants which is to say it's been around for at least a couple of decades. From what I know, it's become famous enough that you will regularly see local Canadian celebrities and politicians drop by for a meal.   The quality of the food here is very high but you'll find that the cost of eating here is equally high, if not a bit higher than you would hope. It's not a place I would go to regularly but if I had to impress clients, this would definitely be one very classy Japanese restaurant to bring them.  If money isn't as much of a concern for you then perhaps this may become one of your go to Japanese restaurants. :)"}
{"text":"I must have passed by this place a hundred times in my life but never been.  Finally stopped by for lunch on a weekday.  Decor is average.  I've seen non-authentic sushi places that tried harder.  Not that it really matters.  They have booths that are a chore to get in and out of.  Sushi was excellent, which is really what mattered.  Fish was fresh.  They have a few lunch specials in the $20-25 range, including non-sushi based items.  The chicken/egg on rice with the egg custard on the side is a great choice and filling.  I also had the sushi pizza.  Hands down the best sushi pizza I've had!  I think Nami is in a relatively tough spot given that the choice for authentic Japanese restaurants has steadily increased in the past 5 years.  They keep it interesting by offering other Japanese options."}
{"text":"I started off my Summerlicious journey by coming to Nami, and it did not disappoint. My friend and I came in at 6 and it was pretty empty, but soon after it quickly filled up. I loved the interior design of the restaurant because there were private booths, tables that can be shared with other people, and benches around the sushi bar area. To start, they gave out a small warm bowl of miso soup.   If you're looking for a Japanese/Sushi restaurant out of the Sumerlicious restaurant list, I recommend Nami because the menu offered a wide variety of items. Appetizer wise, you can choose from sushi/sashimi to salads to tempura. I ordered the Seafood Salad and it was a huge bowl of greeny leafs with seafood such as pieces of boiled shrimp and soft octopus. On the menu, it said there was crab cakes, but unfortunately there wasn't any on mine. I loved the creamy ginger dressing because it wasn't too overwhelming and had a nice simple flavour to it. My friend ordered the Tempura, and it came with five pieces of assorted tempura.   For my main I chose the Sushi and Sashimi Dinner. The sashimi was really fresh and they give you three pieces of salmon, tuna, and yellowtail. Also, there was four pieces of sushi which were tuna, salmon, boiled shrimp, and butter fish. In addition, there was also three pieces of spicy tuna roll. Finally, there was a piece of chef Inari's sushi: rice inside a sweet bean curd bag with shrimp, and crab on top!   No meal is complete without dessert, and god bless their dessert options. We ordered the Mochi Ice Cream and this was delicious, I wish I could've ordered more of these. There was two pieces of soft mochi stuffed with vanilla ice cream. Even after Summerlicious is over, I will definitely come here next time and order from their a la carte menu."}
{"text":"Always passed by this restaurant when I go to Terroni. Finally decided to walk in and check out this place. The first thing I noticed in the menu is the price. Albeit it is not an all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant, the a LA carte food is quite pricey. Just a chirashi dish costs $26, another sashimi dinner costs $28. As such, I decided to go for just unagi and spicy salmon rolls - total to $19  The rolls are pretty standard. Nothing spectacular. However,my friend's tempura dish was surprisingly abundant in quantity. My friend's chirashi dish has 9 kinds of sushi and they do offer two of each kind.  I would also like to mention that when you check in at yelp, you will get 50% off on Sapporo beer. However, when I tried to redeem the coupon, there was some confusion.   Anyway, I think this place is overpriced."}
{"text":"Very biz during diner time. My favorite is uni hand roll. The $10/piece tuna sashimi is good but not good value of money. they have fantastic sake, good to take a couple of shots."}
{"text":"Hubby and I had a great experience here. Waitress was very attentive and made sure we were okay with what we ordered (in case it was something we didn't expect), no allergies, etc. I really appreciated it. Had the seaweed salad ( my favorite), nabeyaki udon, and a set menu special (variety of sushi). Very beautiful presentation in each dish. Yummy in my tummy!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since we were there but we had a good experience. The food was good especially the grilled cod. Not very cheap though. But we would go there again if the opportunity came up."}
{"text":"Anyone who thinks Nami is reasonably priced is on an expense account. I went here on a weeknight when it was relatively empty, with a few men on business who probably didn't have to pay.  The decor feels authentic but quite dated, with the female servers wearing kimonos.  I ordered the salmon dinner for $29, which I thought would at least be a bento box at this price.  Wrong.  It came with an average miso soup and salad,  rice, and a small piece of salmon which I could have made myself.  Maybe if you're on business, you can afford to try one of every dish, but I don't think this restaurant deserves a second chance."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong with the 2 stars only... but for the price I paid, I expected way more. The ambience and decor are unique, and when I went inside, my first thought was \"I have to bring more friends here\"; I ordered the \"Love Boat\" (for 2) and when it arrived at our table, I thought i had ordered the \"Castaway Raft\" Sushi and sashimi on the boat were few, presentation of them was uninspired and the flavor was OK, but nothing to rave about. My thought going out the door after paying the bill was \"I don't think I'm coming back again\" Maybe some other dishes are way better than what I ordered, but if you don't want to be dissapointed, please skip the \"Boat\""}
{"text":"Might be the only place I will eat my sashimi! Their ootoro was amazing, a bit worst than when I had in Japan but already better than most Japanese restaurant in Hong Kong. I see them as the top three places to go to for sashimi in Toronto. Tempura, was ok, at least not soft and saugy like most of the restaurant in Toronto. Other food were good according to the toronto standard. I would always ask for a tamago sushi before I order any sushi to see how the skill is for the chef that handle my sushi"}
{"text":"The last time I ate at Nami was 5 years ago, but I don't feel like much has changed. You enter through its classic dark doors and are greeted with the typical ambience of a fancy Japanese restaurant. The servers speak some Japanese to each other, so that made it feel more authentic.   I'm giving this place 5 stars because I think most of their items on the menu are expensive. For example, the supreme moriawase that's $33 is only 9 pieces nirgiri and 6 small pieces of maki.   We all ordered the chirashi, which I think it's quite the bang for your buck here! For $27, you get a very substantial bowl of rice and fish. The # of pieces of fish you get is less than other places, but the size of the pieces are SO much bigger. Their tamago is HUGE and the best tamago I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"I've realized on my return here just how amazing this restaurant really is, the quality is absolutely fantastic, and well worth the money. I had some of the best sashimi of my life here. This is now my favorite Japanese restaurant in Canada, and among my favorite anywhere period , including Japan."}
{"text":"The Best Sushi place in downtown Toronto. It is authentic, fresh, and the service is amazing!  Make sure you order a bottle of sake to go with your meal!  The fish tastes great and the cooked dishes are also cooked to perfection.  The prices are higher than most \"regular\" sushi places but it definitelt is worth the price.  GO HERE if you are craving extremely good and authentic Sushi downtown!"}
{"text":"This is your typical old-school Japanese restaurant complete with the little curtains at the entrances to their booths and a smaller downtown location.  They have a fish tank when you walk in the door, but it wasn't really doing it for me on the night of our visit.  It looked like it needed a good cleaning on the inside of the tank because it was quite murky.  However, I don't judge sushi bars/Japanese restaurants by the cleanliness of their fish tanks, and there is a good reason for that.  The food was excellent!  Since we were entertaining a business associate, we all shared a number of dishes.  We had the mixed mushrooms (not my personal favorite but very well prepared), hamachi kama, maguro sashimi, black cod, nabeyaki, and a few other items.  Everything was very good, and nothing was left behind.  At the end of the meal, I was very pleasantly surprised that a dinner for three was affordable.  I thought the price was fair for a large meal, including alcohol.  The best/most important part is that my associate thoroughly enjoyed the meal, and still comments on how he wishes us to return on our next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for lunch. I ordered the sashimi lunch special. I like the crabmeat as it was fresh crab meat. All the other sashimi were fresh. I haven't been here for awhile but it does seem the quality is still pretty good!"}
{"text":"I'd say this place is definitely expensive, but offer quality fish. I ordered the chirashi which is sashimi on a bed of sushi rice. It was super fresh, and super tasty. In terms of service, it was just alright but I really liked the ambiance of the restaurant. The waitresses wear kimonos, they have private booths and a tatami room for groups. If you feel like splurging and eating good sushi and Japanese food, swing by this joint. I definitely tasted the quality."}
{"text":"As Japanese restaurants go, Nami is a solid B. I was visiting from Northern Cal where we have some of the most elaborate collection of Japanese restaurants, why with an entire Japan town neighborhoods in SF and SJC.   Nami was quiet, clean and very modern Japanesque in its interior design. The preparations were carefully done and had a few authentic Japanese items (such as Nato beans) which many mainstream restaurants don't care to carry.   Overall a comfortable place for business or family oriented gathering. Service is top notch.   The only reason for a three and not four star is coz I'm spoiled by having lived in N California."}
{"text":"For years I waited until the day I could finally eat at Nami Restaurant.  That day arrived when I was treated to a birthday dinner a few weeks back.  Sadly the wait was not worth it, at all.  The quality and texture was equivalent to the packaged sets you can buy from Sushi-Q.  Terribly disappointing."}
{"text":"Nami. Nami. Nami.   I have heard of your former glory... The once popular hangout for the sushi eating elites... But what has happened?  I had dinner the other night for the first time at Nami having heard of its authenticity and amazing food.  Here's my comments.  Yes, it is extremely authentic. Including the sock wearing flip flop ladies in waiting. You can even sit on the floor mats in the back tables for the true Japanese experience.  No, what I had an issue was, was not the ambiance or the service... We had a first time waiter but he was lovely as he struggled with the language and with the questions I peppered him with.  The soup was decent. Nothing extraordinary to write about. The seaweed salad, again very traditional as it isn't the green type but the black variety... The real kind of seaweed. It also came with a great snow crab leg and sauce on the side.   The mains were my issue... They are supposed to be known for their sushi pizza but it was cold. It was crispy like sushi pizza should be but it was cold... The spring roll sushi was inventive and flavourful wrapped in a rice wrapper but it could of had some zing. Maybe a spicier sauce or something like a sesame mayo. The grilled mushrooms were cold as well, drenched in butter. It lost all the natural flavours of the wonderful variety of mushrooms and left me the feeling of having melted a stick of butter in my mouth.   All in all. It was very expensive and I was left wanting of a better sushi place."}
{"text":"I have been going to Nami for years and only now am I getting around to reviewing it. Hey. Slow day at work. Was there a week ago for lunch.  Best sushi in Toronto - I think better than Takesushi or Hiro. Fish is really fresh and the spicy tuna roll - best in the city. The seafood salad is incredible...wow the dressing. Rolls aren't full of rice (see my review of the Vegas sushi place) which is fabulous - they're actually quite small which I hear is the authentic way of making sushi.  The albacore is amazing. The cooked food generally comes in very small portions - the cod for example is delicious but wow - such a tiny portion. Same for the beef.  Try the chawanmushi - cooked custard with all sorts of treasures in it. Sushi spring roll is a fave. Black sesame ice cream looks like you're eating asphalt but is yuuuum. Very expensive, so be prepared. Service is good."}
{"text":"During summer, I went to Nami often for their summerlicious menu since my office was only 2 minutes away and I love authentic Japanese food. One thing about Nami is that the overall atmosphere here is really nice with a tatami room at the back and individual stalls decorated with bamboo near the sides. The waiters and waitresses are also Japanese and they wear kimonos to further replicate the Japanese restaurant experience.  The premium seafood salad is the only salad ever that I finished. I'm not a gigantic fan of salads but the premium seafood salad really left a deep impression on me. I would definitely order it again without any doubts. The dressing they use is PERFECT and the chunks of seafood were fresh and flavourful. Definitely a 5/5.   The rest of the menu is great  - the salmon don rice, nabeyaki udon, and the sushi moriwase lunch were solid lunch choices. The mochi ice cream is also great - the fruits they use for the ice cream must have been the freshest fruits I have ever ate.   Highly recommend for people that want authentic japanese food in TO!!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant as sashimi is one of my favourite things to try at a restaurant. I was recommended by quite a few friends so I went in with high expectations- only to be very disappointed.  We had reservations and were squeezed in some line of really close tables - that I didn't even have room to get up. It was also very loud so it made conversation very hard to hear even though the person is so close to me already.  Sashimi was okay- wasn't the best cut of fish I've tasted and the roll we had was subpar. There was this type of sashimi bowl we had as well- it was $38 and was REALLY disappointing, caused both of us to not feel well after the dinner.  Service was just OK- wasn't bad but wasn't good. Wanted to get out of there because food wasn't that great and stomachs were starting to feel bad.   A reservation is a MUST if you're coming to eat here."}
{"text":"I don't remember much, but I remember it was 3.5 stars.   I went here with some colleagues after work on Friday for dinner and drinks.   Drinks were in the form of sake and dinner was a mish mash of sashimi, sushi and hot pot... Interesting combination throwing hot pot into the mix of a Japanese restaurant but it seemed to work.   We started off with the BC Tuna Tataki. This serving of fish was incredibly fresh and very very soft and tender... incredibly melt in your mouth. This was then followed up by a sukiyaki for one. I urge anyone going here to get this dish. The noodle soup is served in a hot, boiling bowl with a plethora of meat, mixes and toppings.... The broth was rich and flavourful and the attention to detail was second to none. Throughout my meal, this soup stayed hot. Deeeeelicious.   The fallacy of this restaurant is the wait times between dishes. The service is slow but I guess in some parts, the food makes up for it. Anyways, hidden gem in the financial district, we ended up here because we got rejected from the place next door. 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Ate there again last night, as always the sushi was excellent, along with the authentic Japanese atmosphere."}
{"text":"After reading a friend's review on a sushi restaurant, I was craving for it myself. Decide to head out to Nami. Nami has Winterlicious, but since I'm by myself, might as well treat a little better. I've ordered the Chef's Special, ranging from $70 to $90 per person for main course of about 13 to 15 pieces of sushi, sashimi and/or maki. First came the miso soup, a typical taste, nothing special. As I look around taking pictures, saw this chef making a boat of sushi/sashimi. I assumed it was a love boat for another table, but little I know, the boat came to me unexpectedly. It looked amazing. The chef suddenly came to me explaining each of the sushi/sashimi and how to eat it. I was very impressed even though I had to ask someone at the end what I had due to my forgetful brain. Start eating from top-down with the sashimi first, and then top to bottom from left to right for the sushi.   First Row:  Chutoro Sashimi, Albacore Tuna Sushi with Pickled Wasabi, Ocean Trout Sushi, Jumbo Shrimp Sushi  Second Row:  Kampachi Sashimi, Hamachi with Hokkaido Hotategai Sushi & some kind of egg, Madai Sushi with Charcoal Seasoning & Sesame Oil  Third Row:  Salmon Sashimi with with Charcoal Seasoning, Marinated Akami Sushi, Unagi Sushi  They gave me the real wasabi that was just grind and changed the soy sauce to a more rich and authentic one.  The experience was fantastic, and the waitress keep pouring my tea as I eat my meal."}
{"text":"Great service. Old school omakase -- specify quality over quantity. They definitely don't cheap out and it's worth the value! They served us an expensive fish roe that we've never seen at any of the omakase places we've been to. We were really full -- there were about 18 pieces of sushi and sashimi per person. Would love to go back to try their grill bar next time. Only set back was that they wouldn't let us incorporate kitchen food into the omakase but they did offer to fry our prawn heads and fish bone from the raw mackerel and it was delish. Didn't waste anything on that boat!"}
{"text":"When in Toronto, a good place to stop off at if you're craving some sushi.  What we tried: 1. Spider Roll 2. Tuna Tataki 3. Black Cod 4. Half order of eel 5. Salmon nigiri 6. Scallop nigiri 7. Uni nigiri  Overall, the meal was definitely enjoyable. The eel came out first, and had a pretty good and balanced taste. I love eel, so I enjoyed this.  The Black Code was cooked really well, and I enjoyed that dish probably a bit more than the eel.  The Tuna Tataki and the nigiris were of a pretty good quality. I tend to think of the uni as a good measure of how fresh the nigiris taste, and the uni here was actually pretty decent. I might be spoiled from some of the freshest uni I've tasted of the California coast, but the uni here was still very enjoyable.  The spider Roll was the one low point of the meal. It wasn't bad, but it didn't have the same taste that I'm accustomed too. I wonder if it's more of a regional thing, and the soft shell crab available in other parts of the country have a slightly sweeter taste. Don't know, but what I do know is it tasted a bit off here.   But overall, would go back. Enjoyed the meal, good service, and a great menu."}
{"text":"Apparently, and I can confirm, the poor attitude from the business next door has spilled over. Don't get me wrong, I love the whole Japanese attire the waitresses wear but what they should be sporting is a smile. Is that too much to ask. Really? The food's ok but the presentation is horrible and the prices are outrageous. I work across the street and this place isn't going to be my go to restaurant."}
{"text":"3.5 stars - Came here after the Jay's game on a Friday, it was around 6:30 the place had lots of seats. The look of the restaurant apparently has not changed in many many years I am told by my boyfriend who used to go here with his father. It is cute inside, they have these private booths and the back has a neat private eating section where you sit on the floor. It looks like a lot of fun if you had a party.  The server was very nice, but she had a bit of a struggle understanding us (however, got the order all correct), and she had to keep asking the manager if we could do substitutions.  Unfortunately, the reason my star rating is not higher is because they are so lacking in vegetarian options and are unwilling to substitute things to make it veggie friendly. I really wanted veggie sushi pizza, but somehow they are not able to not put salmon on it :-S I am pretty sure its not difficult to make substitutions if you're making everything fresh. We ended up getting tofu salad (ask for the creamy ginger dressing), veggie rolls (cucumber and avocado) and baked rice patty. Everything was very good, very fresh tasting and the prices are quite reasonable.  I would come back here, but I hope someone of authority there reads this and considers making their menu more appealing to those who do not eat meat or fish. It is pretty easy to do a green dragon roll with avocado and yam tempura, be more creative then cucumber and avocado !"}
{"text":"Very fresh fish along with very good cuts.  Service was above average well.     We are NYers and I visit the west coast a lot so we are pretty hard critics.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Nami is a reasonably priced high end sushi restaurant.  Try the sushi spring roll (a roll wrapped in rice paper with some fish and avocado around the outside)...also definitely try some of the individual grilled items like the whole fish or ribs.   The restaurant is very elegant and they will usually accommodate reservations for specific tables/areas (i.e. booth, hori-gotatsu sunken floor, standard tables).   The service is quite quick and 'authentic' Japanese.  Extensive sake list for the Japanese rice wine connoisseur."}
{"text":"Overall, I was a little disappointed after our first and probably only visit to Nami Friday night.  It was recommended to us as one of the better Japanese restaurants in Toronto.  (We were in for the Rod Stewart/Stevie Nicks concert at ACC)  The decor is kind of touristy cutsey, the servers are all in little matching kimonoes.  It's a style.  We were seated in one of the little enclosed booths with another couple.    My husband is new to the world of sushi, so we started off with a spicy tuna roll, which he loves.  He enjoyed this one as much as the ones at home. He was a little frustrated with the dearth of selection of \"non-seafood/sashimi\" items.  The only poultry selections were dark meat chicken.  He does like dark meat chicken.  I know there are cultural tastes (and I personally like dark meat); I don't know if this is Japanese or Canadian.  He maybe could have ordered one of the set dinners for two with me, but I love sushi so that's what I was planning on.  So he ordered the beef teriyaki, medium rare.  It came with miso soup and salad.  I ordered the Sushi Moriawase.  (I would have just gone with the sashimi, but I wanted DH to try and I knew he'd have to have some rice to make it not so scary.)    First of all, my sushi was excellent.  Beautiful plating, the flying fish roe was gorgeous, like tiny ruby jewels and popped in my mouth like pop rocks.  Everything was fresh and yummy.  Only disappointment was the mackerel.  I'd never had that before and it was just plain nasty and fishy, but that's a personal taste thing, I am sure.    The miso soup was not too salty at all, a common problem.  So that's what we liked.  What we didn't like.  We were rushed from the moment we were seated.  The restaurant was half empty, but our waitress acted like she needed to turn the table NOW!  We'd barely sat and looked at the drinks list and she was asking for our appetizer and drinks order.  We asked for a few more minutes and she returned in three, so my husband hastily chose a glass of wine and I just went with water and we quick chose the spicy tuna roll as a starter.    We had the tuna roll within moments (I didn't feel as if it was freshly made in that time, or else the sushi chefs at our local are very slooooow!) and hardly had we taken a couple of bites when she wanted our entree orders.  As I said, I ordered the Sushi Moriawase and DH the beef teriyaki.  Our soups arrived---yum!  DH got salad; I did not.  His was iceberg lettuce awash in a pale, liquidy dressing of no particular flavor with a couple of paper-thin slices of radish.  It was VERY messy to eat, dressing was everywhere.  He'd hardly finished half his soup and salad and I was just about a third of the way into my soup when our entrees arrived.  (I HATE the main dish being served when I am still trying to eat my starter---it's so rude and shows such poor timing in the kitchen)  Like I said, my meal was enjoyable---DH...oh dear.  His meat was over-cooked to a dull gray, and had the tenderness of old shoe leather, except for the couple of pieces that were essentially blobs of fat.  If that was prime Black Angus beef, Nami committed a grievous crime to it.    The only time our server returned was to drop off the bill, while we were in the midst of our meal!!!  The she hovered just at the edge of sight-line while we uncomfortably finished our meal and picked up the ticket.  As soon as we had, she showed up with her little credit card machine.  (Now that IS clever--have never seen in the States!)  We handed over our credit card, signed, and she started removing the plates and serving pieces from the table.  My husband still had a few bites of beef on his plate (but he didn't want the gristly stuff anyhow) but I would have liked to have finished the tuna roll that had come with my meal, but at that point, I was pretty disgusted and wanted to leave.    All in all, we dropped about $100 Can$ there in and felt hustled out in less than an hour.    Now to be fair, maybe this is culturally Canadian---this kind of promptness is considered good service, though I have not experienced it during stays in BC or AB---but styles can be regional too, I suppose.  I would recommend Nami for the sushi, but not for the other dishes and certainly not for the dining experience.  It wasn't fun or relaxing.    (And I am still wondering about the freshness of that mackerel.)"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!  This is one of my Dad's favourite sushi places in the city, so it's one of the retaurants we go to most often.  It's high-end sushi, as far as Toronto is concerned.  The service is FAB, the atmosphere/design is upscale, chic, very cool but still authentic feeling, and the chefs are INCREDIBLE. You will find some of the freshest ingredients in the city here.  So: to clarify the scope of this review, I am a vegetarian (sometimes I do eat shellfish though... this is a result of a summer spent in PEI in 2008). The only non-veg thing I have tried here is the California Rolls, and that hardly counts!  Nasudengaku - deep-fried eggplant with miso sauce Ohitashi - boiled spinach with sesame sauce Edamame - done RIGHT here! Sansai Udon - soy-based bonito broth with mountain vegetables Kappa Maki - cucumber  Natto Maki - fermented soy bean California Roll - avocado, cucumber, flying fish roe & crab cake Vegetable Maki - avocado & cucumber  And at the robata, my favourites are: Mixed mushroom - grilled or steamed with butter & sake Satsuma Ino - yam/sweet potato Nasu - eggplant  NOTE!!! As tradition dictates, the wasabi is rolled WITH the maki when the chef prepares them. If you are sensitive to or dislike wasabi, be SURE to alert your server or ask to have it left out completely so you can flavour to your own taste!"}
{"text":"Walked in without any prior knowledge of this place. The sushi was very good and the wait staff, super attentive. The fish was fresh and portion size was appropriate. I was dining solo but I'd give this place another try with friends."}
{"text":"Went with a party of four, so many reviews.  Good: The fish (not sushi) aka the Robata menu was good. Shrimp tempura was very good (note below veg tempura below) Good miso soup. Tasty sauce in house salad.  Bad: Presentation of roll was poor. Both teriyakis ordered were definitely sub-par Vegetable tempura was definitely not up to par. Service was slightly disappointing and not very attentive (tea refill was difficult) The squid was under-done. Need a party of at least 8 for the tatami mats.  Overall, we expected much more. We've been to Japan, and some of us even lived there. With all the positive reviews, we thought this would be our new go-to place; alas, we won't return. They deserve 1.5 stars, but will round to 2 in kindness."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite Japanese restaurants downtown.   I've come here numerous times in the past few years. My favourites are the chirashi sushi and the robata course dinner (for two). The fish is always fresh and tasty in the chirashi - I highly recommend trying it here. On the other hand, the robata is a one of a kind experience. I've gotten the robata twice and each time it was delicious and satisfying. Some of the highlights include the grilled yellowtail neck which melts in your mouth, and the flavourful black cod. It felt like there were an endless number of courses in the meal. If you're a fan of robata this is a must try! I would have to say the 2015 Summerlicious menu was the worst meal I've had here; with average sushi and spicy salmon rolls drenched in sauce. However the robata and the chirashi definitely make up for that experience.   Every time I come here the service is spectacular. the waitresses are so friendly and accomodating. Highly recommend checking out this gem!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with one of my friends...pretty packed on a Wednesday due to the location, close to financial district and the food quality wasn't bad...I am overall giving this place a 3.5/5 ...  I ordered the black cod udon, which was quite filling with salad and soup...nothing really screamed delicious but it was decent food for a decent price, especially in the DT area.. The service was prompt in filling our teas and water....   It all came to approximately $25 per person..all in all, a place I'm.coming back with no doubts..."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago after reading some reviews and since I was craving some sushi. We ordered the edamame, seaweed salad, and a few maki rolls.  We didn't end up ordering any of the sushi or sashimi because honestly, they were a little expensive... About 10-15$ for 2 pcs of sushi or 3 pcs of sashimi.  Of the rolls that we ordered, we had the unagi roll, the spicy salmon, the California, and the crispy butterfish.  All the rolls that we tried were amazing. The fish was fresh the flavors were great and although they're just traditional simple rolls without much frills (there's a lot of places that add a lot of pzazz such as flambé and what nots) but the taste was definitely very much above average, probably one of the best sushis I've had in Toronto.  The only downside is that it is a little expensive... So check the menu before going!"}
{"text":"Nami is a Japanese restaurant located in the heart of the downtown/financial district.  The restaurant is up a flight of stairs and the bathrooms are gendered.  The menu is expansive, but if you're vegetarian or vegan, your options are VERY limited.    The food was more \"traditional\" Japanese food you'd find in Canada; the menu stuck to staples like miso soup, bento boxes, tempura, classic sushi rolls, nigiris and sashimis, and green tea ice cream.  If you're looking for more fusion or modern Japanese food, this is not the place for you.  If you're looking for quality and more traditional Japanese-Canadian food, I'd come visit.  I found the prices a little bit on the high side, but I would certainly return for lunch."}
{"text":"The food is meh but pricy, had better at $10 lunch sushi places. Service was not good either. The waitress had good attitude but doesn't seem to know what she was doing, very unprofessional. We had to wait for her for a long time to do anything. On Wednesday night they were not busy at all. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"I had a lovely experience here. Very authentic vibe (the servers wear kimonos) and friendly service. The sushi is great, you can tell that it is high quality fish. A little on the expensive side but worth it if you're willing to splurge on some high quality sushi!  I also really like their private booths."}
{"text":"Everything was tasting amazing and the service was great. I would recommend giving it a try if you have some extra money for a meal."}
{"text":"Nice local sushi joint, almost always guaranteed to find a seat. I always get the tempura udon as it's super tasty and the batter isn't overwhelming. The botan-ebi shrimp is another favourite, especially when they fry the heads afterwards.   Service is consistent, can be slow sometimes but that's normally cause the restaurant is busy so can't really complain. Clean, bright and not cramped and pretty centrally located, no complaints here apart from the fact it's not open on Sundays"}
{"text":"Nami was pretty much the place to go for sushi in Toronto in the early 1990s. There were a couple places at Bloor/Christie but those were Korean and they looked pretty sketchy to Toronto people circa 1991 who were just getting over the idea sushi wasn't just a punchline but something you might actually want to eat. We were still, indeed, pretty paranoid about eating something raw and afraid of death by ill prepared sushi, as if wrapping salmon in rice and seaweed required the skills of a licensed fugu chef.   It was great sushi. And expensive. The kind of place you held in reserve for when your rich aunt and uncle came to town and wonder where they could take you to eat. \"I know a place. You guys like sushi?\"  Eventually, sushi became democratized in Toronto. The Sushi Bistro on Queen kicked it off. $15 (in 1995 dollars) for a \"makimono set\" was amazing deal compared to the $30-$50 you might have to throw down at Nami. Oddly for $15 now (in 2014 dollars) you can get decent all you can eat sushi at a number of places.   Anyway, my GF and I decided to give this blast from the past try for a Friday night repast. It strikes me that many of the people working here are actually Japanese people. Not that Koreans and Chinese and Mexicans can't make great sushi. But never much been a fan of when Koreans *pretend* to be Japanese because they think western diners just won't get Koreans also make and consume sushi. Although they call it chobap.  So. Yeah. After spending the last few years pretty much only eating AYCE sushi, it was kind of nice again to eat decent real sushi. Something more than salmon or \"white tuna\".   And Nami still abides."}
{"text":"Came here for my boyfriend's birthday - service was good.  We ordered the Robata Special Dinner (for two people) which includes: * Yakitori * Steamed Mixed Mushroom * Grilled Scallops, Black Cod (so good!), Yaki Onigiri * Grilled US Black Angus Beef   I liked the Black Cod, Yaki Onigiri and grilled Scallops the most. The balance between the veggies and meats in the dinner set was great. Felt pretty healthy after the meal haha (despite eating 3 scoops of ice cream & a cake for desserts!) :P"}
{"text":"Great sushi - all the fish was very fresh. Arrived just after it opened, so it was quiet, but things picked up. The restaurant has secluded booths and is darkly lit, which makes for a nice ambiance. Tried the sushi pizza and tuna appetizers. Also got a few rolls. Overall it is a little pricey, but it's worth it for the quality and was a short walk from our hotel (One King West)."}
{"text":"Oh Nami, may I count the ways I love you...  I have a serious love affair with this place.  I remember many late nights, sitting in the private booths, eating some of the best vegetarian sushi I've ever had.  It's a great place for dinner parties or work meetings.  The staff is very traditional and so polite.  I love this place and if I lived in Toronto, I would want to make it my home.  SOME FAVORITES OF MINE ON THE MENU:  CHEF'S CHOICE PLATTER:  I don't eat fish but I thought I'd start out with a shout out to this one.  I was at a work dinner meeting and my boss and a coworker ordered this and man, they said it was out of this world.  It's a blast seeing what's fresh.  If I had to eat fish, I think that this sushi place might be a great place to do it.  VEGETARIAN ROLLS:  Great avocado/cucumber roll here.  Very fresh, rice is a great texture.  VEGETARIAN TEMPURA:  Yummy tempura.  Not greasy at all.  The sauce is great to eat it with.  AGEDASHI TOFU:  YUM.  I remember this always being a favorite of mine when visiting.  Great big portion.    STEAMED MUSHROOMS:  I dream about these, so much so that I have begun to seek them out at different places when I am in Los Angeles.  Now that I came back to Toronto, I will say that these may be a little more subtle than some places I have had them ... but these mushrooms have a mellow creamy texture I just can't get over.  GREEN TEA CREME BRULEE:  The waitress recommended this to me over the mochi and I was so glad she did.  Kudos to her, because this may be one of the best custard/brulee's I have ever had.  Was thick, rich, and mellow at the same time.  I am sure there are tons of great dishes that I have tried that I am missing, but these are the standouts to me.  I love Nami, and I wish I lived in Toronto full time so that I could enjoy Nami year round..."}
{"text":"This place is probably normally better than a three star, but we made the mistake of arriving shortly before they were closing the kitchen down at the end of lunch, so we had to order all of our food upfront and very quickly, which isn't what I look for in a good sushi restaurant.  There were about a half-dozen options on the menu that were vegan and a couple more that were easily modifiable to be so.  The waitress was helpful, warning us when we attempted to order items that did not fit our diet.  What we had was good, about four stars.  And I thought the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Nami - on my TDL for a while, and was happy when my friend Jon, a regular here, suggested it as a proper way to end off a productive Tuesday. It was a toss up with Terroni (one of my faves), but Jon made the right call.   Nami is an authentic higher end Japanese restaurant.   We didn't hold back. Here is the run down:  - Kaiso Salad - Osumashi Soup - Toro - (fatty tuna) - black cod - sea bream  - spicy salmon roll - spicy tuna roll  The Kauai salad - was delicious. The seaweed was perfectly chopped into bite sized pieces. Served with the soy based dressing on the side and accompanied by radishes, shrimp and lemon. Once the right amount of dressing was applied the salad took on an absolutely amazing flavour that I haven't tasted before.   The soup - was not as hot as I like but still very flavourful and clean. The broth was translucent and not cloudy. In it, was a delicious blend of fish, shrimp, fish cake and sea weed.   The Toro - i.e. Fatty Tuna. So fatty tuna is my most favourite piece of fish in the world. At $10 per slice of sashimi, it is expensive - but absolutely worth it. They serve 3 pieces of sashimi for $30 or 2 pieces of Sushi for $20. We opted for the sushi hoping to eat more later but we got full so boo! It was perfectly fatty and also fat in size. This is the filet mignon of fish.   The black cod - was a delicious and perfectly cooked piece of fish. It was lined with a crispy, flavourful lining of skin. Moist, tender, flavourful and delicious. A must have.   The Sea Bream - was bonkers. Grilled, powdered in a tempura like batter to finish it off. Market price was $34 for the fish, which is a bit pricey, but thankfully my friend was treating. It took us just a couple of mins to devour this little guy nose to tail.   Both the Spicy salmon roll and spicy tuna roll were fantastic. The rice was perfectly done and the meat was super fresh. Right amount of meat to rice ratio as well as the right amount of spice.   As a side note, the wasabi was also delicious as was the soy sauce. Not your run of your mill all you can eat restaurant.   $160 plus tax and tip, inclusive of 480ml of wine consumed by the host.   Service was also amazing.   Go! Go! Go!  The only reason that I give it a 5/5 is because it's not a douchy vibe at all. Very chilled out and humble, which is just my style."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is one of the best sushi restaurant's in Toronto, if not the best.  I've been to places like sushi Kaji, but Nami has dishes that are just unique and in a class of their own.  You can't go wrong with the sashimi dishes.  HIGHLY recommend the BC tuna with ginger and shallots -- amazing flavour.  The salmon carpaccio has a zesty tamarind kick in it which is amazing... on a bed of fresh salad.  Yum!  It's great for a romantic evening though.  If you reserve in advance for a special evening, ask for a private booth.  Very friendly service and top quality sea food (at least, for Toronto's standard)  Downside?   The prices are steep."}
{"text":"It IS possible to have great sushi in Toronto!  Nami set the bar for all my dining experiences in Toronto and was hard to top.  When you enter the restaurant, you'll be confronted by a samurai warrior.  Not a real one, it was just a costume, but beside it you'll be greeted by a friendly Japanese hostess dressed in a traditional kimono.  So far so good.    The Sushi Pizza was recommended to me a few time from friends so I had to order it.  Salmon sashimi topped with spicy sauce and roe on top of deep fried rice.  The combination and textures went together very well.  All other nigiri and sushi I ordered were fresh and high quality.    As my husband and I ate, there was soft music playing in the background.  I know it was a CD, but I imagined a harp being played behind one of the screen doors while a geisha danced to the music.  The service throughout our whole meal was fantastic and we'll be back again."}
{"text":"Winterlicious 2017 begins.  We opt to go during lunch time.  The place was packed and good thing I made reservation for our large group of 16 people.  We sat down and waited a long time for tea.  We didn't even end up getting a menu but we knew what we want.  I ordered the tempura, sushi and pudding.  Nothing special for the tempura.  It wasn't crispy at all and we waited long for each courses.  Sushi was average, not high graded fish, just regular fish you eat anywhere else for half the price.  The portion was rather small.  All of us had to get BK after.  As for dessert, they ran out of pudding and sub for ice cream.  I was rather disappointed as we made reservation ahead of time where they could have planned better.  Overall it was just regular sushi restaurant paying for a premium price."}
{"text":"I like! Outside looks like a ka-ra-o-ke bang to me, but inside is nice. More importantly, the service is very good and from my first visit, food fulfilling.  Got the Robata Set B. So good, salmon neck for fish recommended by the waitress who I was shocked to find smiled very brightly, probably thinking about the fish. Noted the waitresses seem generally very happy here, which I feel rubs off on you.  I will definitely come back, and try some other fish!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Japanese restaurant in terms of food and atmosphere. The best part about it is how traditional looking the entire restaurant looks. From the interior design, to the waitresses wearing kimonos, you almost feel like you've traveled to ancient Japan once you've stepped in. The food was somewhat pricey but you do get what you pay for in quality. I would recommend the sushi pizza."}
{"text":"Walked by this place many times but went for dinner for the first time recently.  I thought it was good but not amazing.  The sushi was fresh but was pricey for what you get.  Service was really good and the place felt authentic.  If you're going for value, skip this place as there are dozens of other sushi joints in Toronto where you will get more for less."}
{"text":"When I went to Nami, there were so many choices I ordered them all.  Miso Soup- amazing. Great appetizer to start a great meal.   Steamed rice - really good. A great side dish  Shrimp tempura - fried perfectly. Probably my favourite group appetizer  Niku Udon - AMAZING. steak was cooked perfectly and the broth steak and noodles worked together to make a dish I will never forget.   Cucumber roll - very good and tasty   You must go to this restaurant if visiting Toronto. You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Fantastic place.  Women dressed in traditional garb, quiet atmosphere, and best of all, food that makes you say \"WOW!\".  Try the miso Black Cod and the black sesame ice cream for sure.  Ahhhmazing."}
{"text":"No place says that you've \"arrived\" more than Nami.   Sure, you could get excellent sushi from any of the 350 Sushi restaurants in the city for $15,  but at Nami you can get the exact same thing for eight times the price.    All this, and you get to be surrounded at lunch by a variety of the top middle management in the downtown core, all wearing their fancypants business costumes.      It's like Harry Rosen himself, munching on Tuna rolls like there's no tomorrow.    It's a delicious, but expensive time machine.   You're whisked away to 1989.   Going for sushi is an ethnic delicacy and you're comparing business cards as you argue who to expense lunch to.     Recommended."}
{"text":"I like their food and atmosphere. But the service was mediocre. I had to cancel my sushi dinner plate because the place was overcrowded and took forever to serve it. The number of employees was not enough for the number of customers. I was so sad because I went there solely for sushi but ended up eating anything but sushi: bits of my family's 'kitchen prepared' dishes and dessert. They did not compensate for their disorganization of not being able to even serve sushi- no manager came up to me to apologize, no discount or anything, except for the server who seemed to be a bit sorry for this. I was disappointed because I thought this place was finally going to be the my personal best authentic Japanese restaurant in Toronto. So far I haven't found any Japanese restaurant here that have the same quality of taste and service as in Japan."}
{"text":"Nami has the freshest fish in the city.  After having been spoiled on the west coast, I'm thankful to find my hole in the wall that just delivers excellent sushi and sashimi.    I don't particularly care for the decor, any of the sushi rolls or the fact that waitresses do not clear the hot towels for the entire duration of your meal but it's frankly irrelevant when you're the only game in town with sushi like this.    Sit at the bar, enjoy a cold beer and enjoy what the Itamae serves you!"}
{"text":"Never disappoints. Among the best Japanese restaurants in toronto. Atmosphere/decor is superior."}
{"text":"I had the premium seafood salad from the restaurant, and it was absolutely the BEST salad I have ever had in my life. All the seafood was fresh, the dressing complemented it well (without drenching the salad), and the fish roe on it was the cherry on top of it! I 100% recommend getting the premium seafood salad, you will not regret it!   The restaurant was also very authentic, with areas of the restaurant where people can eat on tatami mats. The customer was decent too, but they sometimes had trouble understanding what we were asking."}
{"text":"One of my favourite sushi restaurants in Toronto. The Robata Bar is a particular highlight, with many choices of fish (black cod is incredible), meat (their steak is delicious too), and vegetables (yams, zucchini, eggplant, mushrooms cooked to perfection). I have always been extremely pleased with their service, their professionalism, and the quality of their food. Their Sapporo is also ice cold and flavourful.  The sushi bar is very traditional and they don't generally go for anything too fancy or trendy which is sometimes preferable when you want to highlight the quality of the seafood - which they do! I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for an authentic, delicious, and sublime Japanese experience!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times and absolutely love this restaurant. Ambiance is great, service is fantastic, and food is amazing.  Try the black cod, and sushi spring roll. Seafood salad is refreshing.  Sushi pizza is to die for. I just discovered that Nami originated the sushi pizza which is why it's the best in Toronto."}
{"text":"Nami serves traditional Japanese cuisine. Sushi, sashimi, and sukiyaki dinner set - my family and I ordered a variety and shared.   To be honest, although we enjoyed our meal, we didn't find anything memorable or outstanding. The sushi and sashimi tasted pretty much the same as lower cost/grade restaurants'. The sukiyaki had a strong soy flavor (a bit saltier than my liking). Wished it was a tad bit sweeter. Portion however was surprisingly generous especially for the sukiyaki dinner. My dad who is a borderline competitive eater had leftovers!   Some of the dinner sets were served with miso soup, some with salad, some with ice cream. Wished they just made all equal so it would be less confusing. Overall - $35 average for each dinner set before tax and tip. A bit overpriced but glad we gave it a try!"}
{"text":"Yum. For my money, this is the best sushi in Toronto. Though maybe a bit overpriced and a bit skimpily cut, the fish is as fresh and tasty as all get out. I've had some of the cooked food, too. The miso sea bass is sublime, though also very small. The ohiitashi is great. The salmon teriyaki is dry, but show me a cooked salmon dish that isn't dry. The chicken karaage and tuna tataki are also very good. And, of course, the black sesame ice cream is a must.  If you have $40-$100 burning a hole in your pocket, go here. The only thing that may be disappointing is the prices.  (And this place is more of a 4.5 than a 4.)"}
{"text":"I loved my experience during dinner tonight. The sushi was very fresh and he chefs selection didn't disappoint. Big shot outs to the chef, I loved the selection !"}
{"text":"Amazing o-toro. the sushi spring roll was super awesome number 1. the miso soup was lack luster, skip it."}
{"text":"Finally a Sushi restaurant in Toronto that lives up to its pricing. I have been to several 'upscale' Japanese restaurants downtown and have always been disappointed with service levels and portions but this place scored 5 stars on both counts. We went with the Sashimi Bento Box. The Mitso soup was very good, the salad was fresh and the Sashimi portions were very large and fresh. They have a good selection of beers and wines as well as mixed drinks. Reserve in advance, this place is packed at lunch and try and get a booth for a more intimate dining experience."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Fresh ingredients. Attentive waitresses. No complaints whatsoever. I can't wait to go back and try something else on the menu. I see that there are some polarizing reviews up here for Nami, but until you check it out yourself and form your own opinion, you won't really know if it's good or not. Typically, if you like what you see on the photos means that there's a high probability that you will have a good experience at a given venue."}
{"text":"Eh. It wasn't very exciting.  I went here with 2 of my girlfriends and I was underwhelmed.  Sushi was good but not amazing.  We ordered some sashimi a la carte, which we enjoyed.  We had the sushi pizza.  It was very good.  I would probably order that again.  It's basically salmon and roe over a bed slightly crisped rice.  I usually like crispy stuff.  And, we had a couple rolls with tuna/salmon/Hamachi.  They were all good but not very exciting.  We were there on a Saturday night and they close at 10am.  I was really surprised, esp since we were downtown.  Would I come back?  No.  If I did come back, maybe I would order the chirashi bowl. Would I recommend this restaurant?  No."}
{"text":"Cozy and warm atmosphere and staff was kind. I ordered sushi and sashimi dinner, but I got disappointed. Tuna was not fresh. Beef steak in the course menu was not tender but sauce on it was very flavourful. Their in-house green tea warmed me up. Anyway, I feel like little hesitated coming back."}
{"text":"One of my clients referred this restaurant to me & I thought I'd give it a shot.  Apparently, it was her go-to place for her business luncheons.   As soon as I walked in, I noticed the waitress in authentic Japanese clothing.  I knew that the prices weren't going to be cheap.  I was suprised that the prices weren't that high..The services were quite good & so was the food. I'm always a fan of miso soup.  I ordered the lunch special which is the Salmon Terriyaki.  I really enjoyed the taste.  The vegetable & shrimp tempura were pretty good too.   I would definitely recommend this restaurant for you to visit.  If you're in the mood for an authentic Japanese experience, Nami is your restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a child so you know Nami is a solid Japanese restaurant when it's been around for so many years. The restaurant is clean, the service is good, they take reservations and the fish is always fresh. I usually get the soba w/mountain vegetables or beef, sashimi dinner or chirashi sushi. Honestly, everything here is fantastic so I'm sure whatever you order will be amazing."}
{"text":"Well, starting this review off as I would with ANY Sushi review, namely based on the actual quality of the sushi(meaning FISH), not the rice, or the tempura, or the soup (idiots). Although the miso was fine and the black cod was delicious, I am here to talk about the sushi (or in my case the sashimi, as i no longer eat carbs).  Sidenote: I used to come here every weekend with my parents, probably from the age of 7-13, it wasnt until i turned 11 that i tried sushi, and its been a love affair ever since. On to the review, Nami hasnt changed since the last time I visited 12 years ago, honestly. But with that said, it still remains a traditional, get to the point japanese place, its not super flashy, but sushi resto's arent supposed to be. Service wasnt fantastic,  but then again most old-school resto's in toronto arent used to young guys in jeans ordering alot (as this young guy in jeans does). SO with that said, I tasted a good variety of their sashimi last night, let me start off by saying that the hamachi might be the best ive had in a long long time, maybe even better then katsura's. Fluke was superb, salmon was salmon  (very fresh at that), and I tried a offspring of the hamachi called bamachi, or something like that, which was also good. but wow was that hamachi ever delicious. Summary: if you like sushi/sashimi, this is definitely one of the best places in Toronto to do so. If you like dynamite rolls, well your just not worthy"}
{"text":"I was sad to see the sushi boats floating on water no longer there when I was a kid, hope they'll bring em back! The decor is still pretty nice, I love how they have the traditional Japanese style rooms.   Ordered the BC Tuna Tataki, Beef Aguri Pizza and the Sushi+Sashimi Dinner Platter.  All delicious goodness, BC tuna softy soft, Aguri pizza's beef was flavour land and a nice contrast to all the fish. Finally the platter had some unique tasty piece in there. Sushi quality was definitely quite solid but didn't feel that it was that amazing for that price. ($40 - 6 sushi , 6 maki, 4 sashimi) Spent about $80 and still felt kind of hungry. Happy with food though."}
{"text":"So delicious! I took a first date here, and dropped a pretty penny on a few platters and a bottle of their finest. The ambience was really pleasant, the wine was extraordinary, and the sushi was incredibly addictive. My date was really happy! Indefinitely recommend this place for a romantic night out."}
{"text":"I'm giving Nami a 3.5/5. Came here for summerlicious dinner and instantly loved the interior and authentic decor and waitresses dressed in kimonos. They also had a section to sit in front of a chef as well as an authentic Japanese-style sit down table at the back. The food was great, however, the service didn't meet my expectations for a nice place like this.   We ordered the sushi and sashimi for appetizer, salmon teriyaki and unagi bowl for main, and green tea ice cream and pudding for dessert. The sashimi and sushi was amazingly fresh (5/5 stars) and the mains were flavorful but the service was slow (3/5 stars). It took 20 minutes just for appetizers to arrive and then some before the main dishes. What's more, we received beef teriyaki instead of salmon teriyaki. We were too hungry to bring this error up so we let it be. But at least the beef was tasty and cooked medium. The unagi was very delicious too. As for dessert, it was okay, nothing spectacular.   Overall, I'm undecided as to whether I want to go back here. The food was great, the decor was awesome, but the service could be better (especially for summerlicious customers)."}
{"text":"Nami delivers consistently good food, polite and efficient service, and a nice, quiet atmosphere.    One specific thing about this place that I love is that they have these semi-private booths that have dividers separating you from the booths next to you in either direction.  If you can get one of those booths, it's definitely worth it for some privacy.    For an appetizer, I recommend the BC tuna tataki.  For a main course, I recommend any sushi, but the premium sushi dinner is a good way to go.  It's a nice selection of salmon, tuna, eel, scallop, and other pieces of nigiri.  It comes with miso soup, too."}
