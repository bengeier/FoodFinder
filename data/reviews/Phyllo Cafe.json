{"text":"I'd give this a 2.5 stars if possible.

Pros:
- It's new so it's got that nice ambiance to it.
- Service is fairly quick

Cons:
- Very pricey for what's offered. Two small coffees and two small pastries ended up being $14."}
{"text":"Came here because of lovely promotion on BlogTO. Beautiful new cafe, everything shiny and upscale, Greek pastries authentic and delicious - but I want to feel welcome when I arrive. Youngish guy behind the counter talking loudly to youngish woman and not greeting us was the start. Whatever is the mood or magic that makes one want to return was not here for us - or were we so clearly not of the Greek community? Too bad, won't return."}
{"text":"Clean and quaint Phyllo spot. You're definitely paying for the renovations done to make it look as chic as it is.  Regardless, the staff are wonderful, kind and informative. 

I went at lunch and it wasn't that busy, ordered the cheese boat with bacon which was just over $12.  The women warned me that it would take about 30 minutes to make. After 40 min (my whole lunch) it finally came and man was it worth being late!!! DELICIOUS!!!

Coffee is premium coffee at premium prices. (You get what you pay for)

My advice would be to call ahead if you want any of their 'Cheese boats'."}
{"text":"This spot is a clean with a nice ambience. 

The display case has fresh phyllo pastries as well when I went there were samples at the top of the counter. 

One spanikopita square is $4.25 and up.  Not the most budget friendly or under the \"cheap eats\" category; please don't expect it to be such. It would be around 4\"X4\" around there in size. 

The pastry I did try was flaky & crisp & filling had flavour. I saw there are other menu items such as crepes. 

One of the nicer spots in that neighbourhood. It was quiet during my visit."}
{"text":"Very kind service and delicious cheese boat. It pays off. Cheese lovers this is a must."}
