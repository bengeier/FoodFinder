{"text":"So funny about the one review calling this 'the ashtray'. Yup! You smell like one when you leave, but the folk and the food don't get no better!!  We're huge fans of their burgers and their buffalo chicken salad and sandwiches. Fries are great too!  There is a dining area...  right by some pool tables ... in an adjoining room. Not much smoke over there and that's where we usually eat. But a lot of times we just chuck it up and eat in the bar. There's always a shower in our future once we get home. With a belly full of good food and some beer  AND getting our money's worth- we're happy Manny's fans!"}
{"text":"\"The Ashtray\" is a great nickname.  Really smoky and it gets in everything.  If you're not a smoker you won't like it. The crowd is mostly regulars who tend to give the hairy eyeball to newbs. The crazy bar arrangement can leave you literally sitting right in front of the main entrance, inches from the door.  Otherwise pretty average old-school bluecollar neighborhood place."}
{"text":"Super fun bar! Sammy is a great cook and bartender. Try the stuffed mushrooms w crabmeat or the GIANT muffaletta sandwich, both are great!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Hands down Best wings in Pittsburgh!! All the food is great but the wings are my personal favorite. First Class management and service! Try it for your self!"}
{"text":"I lovingly referred to this place during our visit, as \"The Ashtray\".  Yes. You will walk out of there smelling like one, but you'll also leave with a smile on your face... some pretty nice folks hang out there."}
