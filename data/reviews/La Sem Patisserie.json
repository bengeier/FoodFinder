{"text":"Best sfoglia cake in town. Hands down. I haven't had much else here. But if you need an amazing sfogliatelle cake, this is the place to get it!"}
{"text":"I bought a cake from here for Mother's Day and I have to truly say, it can't get any better than this! We ordered a Red Velvet Cake without Rum (for the kids lol) and it was honestly delicious! It was just the perfect pitch of sweetness and every bite gave you a sensation to die for! The price is expensive but you get what you pay for! Will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Have ordered several custom made cakes and cupcake cakes for special events and birthdays. Amazing! Great job, professional, friendly staff, fresh, never disappointed! Would highly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I've only ever gotten the Tiramisu here (always ordered in advance, always to go), and its incredible. Best I have ever tasted available for purchase. The only person who makes it better is a friend of mine. They have actually lowered their price from what it used to be years ago, and it's not expensive at all. My recommendation: ask for more liquer or espresso (moister) because otherwise they don't put much; they told me it's because some people don't like for it to be moister (lol)."}
{"text":"An old school italian eatery.  It was a true pleasure to eat here.  It reminds me of the little neighborhood places when i was in New York.  You can taste the love this place puts into their food.  Now we actually came in for the bakery section, not for dinner, but hey, it was worth it. And a must have when you dine in is the icecream.  Make sure you give that a try.  So the food is great and the price is right but i dont think its possible to get out of this place without a box full of little goodies from their bakery.  I know, I've been trying for about a decade now and still cant leave without some tasty treats for later."}
{"text":"Stoped in here on my way out of Toronto on recommendation from a friend. They make an amazing cappuccino! It was my first time having zeppole. They were so delicate in flavor and soft. They just melt on your mouth. The staff are very friendly and helpful. It is not to far from the airport so if you have time stop in. I didn't get any cookies but my friend did and swears by them and he brought a bunch home to his Italian family."}
{"text":"I've ordered a 2 things from this place, and I've gotta say, I was extremely satisfied each time! 
Their cannoli's are killer....the outer shell has the perfect crunch, not soggy at all like others I've tried. The ricotta filling is exceptional, it has a slight hint of lemon or something in it, without being too overpowering.
I've also ordered a sfoglia cake with chocolate and cappuccino flavoured fillings. The cream fillings were alright, but the thing I was most pleased about was the fact that the cream didn't make the flaky layer of the cake soggy........nothing worse than biting into a piece of sfoglia that has the texture of wet cardboard!  
I'd definitely recommend ordering cakes and pastries from here.....and to top it off, it's not too pricey compared to it's competitors."}
{"text":"I've been a regular here for about 8 years. However my latest sfoglia cake order wasn't the best in comparison to past orders. It was too creamy, with barely visible fruit filling, drizzled with barely there chocolate over top. Half the cake (aka cream) was not enjoyed by my guests as they are health conscious. What a waste and how embarrassing! It wasn't cheap either."}
{"text":"Horrible service and poor quality. The place is filthy with bugs. Bought gelato and espresso both to disappointment. Not feeling well after that gelato, wondering how long it's been sitting in that container."}
{"text":"I've been making my pastry and cake orders here for a number of years. I've had maybe 3 bad experiences.  Today I picked up my dad's birthday cake. Of course another custom order. It didn't disappoint. It was a chocolate sponge w/ rum, filled with amaretto creme and wild berries. The outside was a whip cream topped with glazed strawberries and chocolate swirls. (You can sponges with or without rum) Maria is great! She is precise and will take the extra time to let you know if flavors will or will not pair well. Let's not forget their ricotta cannoli!! Yummm!"}
{"text":"If someone kept putting La Sem's Tiramisu in front of me, I would keep eating it until my stomach exploded. I would literally be unable to stop myself even with my life on the line. With every bite, you feel like it is your first. The flavour is so amazing, you just do not tire of the taste.  

They do make a variety of other cakes as well. All that I have tried have been, as I have mentioned before, to die for. There is also a nice selection of fresh pastries ready for you to choose from if you happen to stop by to fill that sudden craving for sweets.

This place has easily become one of my favourite joints for cakes, and it will just as easily become yours."}
{"text":"Cakes are dry. Taste as if they have been sitting around for a week.  Cashier is inattentive and doesn't listen to requests while choosing items, but has a overall friendly attitude.  We had to wait 5 mins for ice cream we purchased.  You can taste the inside of this fridge."}
{"text":"Just walked in to check it out.. ordered the small mini cakes. One tirumasu one red velvet one cheesecake. Wasn't impressed. Cake was stale. My friend ordered the ice cream and he said it sucked."}
