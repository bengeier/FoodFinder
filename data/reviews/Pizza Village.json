{"text":"This is another one of those hidden gems in Toronto. Went here for my first time and the food really exceeded my expectations. Not a dine in place but do they have a side table mounted on the wall if you want to eat it while it's hot.


First, the food... They have a lot of items on their menu so my friends and I decided to order a good variety of food to try a little bit of everything. I tried the homemade burger, steak burger, fish burger (in their \"hidden menu.\" I just told the owner I was craving a fish Burger and she said she can make it for me haha really nice service IMO), chicken wings, poutine, Greek salad, fish and chips, chicken souvlaki dinner, and their cheeseburger. The homemade burger is hand made and you can definitely taste the difference in the patty; moist and tender. Fish burger uses the fish from the fish and chips. If you thought McDonalds fish burger is good, wait til you try this...please add extra tartar sauce...my friends demolished the chicken souvlaki so didn't get to try it. Heard the chicken was not dry which is surprisingly hard to find these days...poutine was a classic. I wanted some fries deep fried after the order was made and again the owner was nice enough to do that. Made fries taste really fresh and the cheese was melted as well. Chicken wings are very crispy, so make sure you eat this one while it's hot!

Overall, id recommend to grab the poutine and homemade burger on your first try. But from quality, consistency, and uniqueness stand point this place has definitely not disappointed!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on yelp I decided to check this place out. It's a small hole in the wall with no seating. It appeared clean with an extensive menu.

It's called Pizza Village but yet there is no pizza served here. The three customers that came in while I was there ordered poutine so that's what I ordered as well. 

A large was $4.45 so very reasonable for sure. So out of five stars I had to deduct a point for frozen fries instead of fresh cut. A point for using shredded cheese instead of curds and a point as well for the heavy greasy taste of old oil. 

I give it a 2/5 but considering how much I didn't eat it should probably be a 1. All in all I don't think I'd come back for the poutine. Maybe something else on the menu."}
{"text":"From sneaking out for lunch during elementary school to a quick after school snack, this place will always have a heart warming feeling of nostalgia to me. Love their poutine and burgers. The cheese curds melt perfectly with the gravy and the burger is nice and juicy. Btw I feel like the low ratings are just because you didn't grow up/go to school around here ?"}
{"text":"Great food, reasonably priced, and friendly service - Pizza Village remains one of my favourite hidden gems in South Scarborough. 

There's something quaint about this mom and pop burger joint. It's quick service pick-up and go place. Yet, the stay, ever so brief, is always pleasant. I've only been there a few times but I'm on a first name basis with the staff (albeit there's not a whole lot of them). Despite being rushed with orders, they always make time for a quick chat. 

The food selection here is surprisingly diverse. Despite its name, the focus here is on burgers. They have great burgers for great price. Their burgers are simple and hearty, with an underlying homemade taste. It's consistency is another thing worth complimenting. It's always a pleasant experience at Pizza Village. 

9/10 - value
8/10 - food

{"text":"Consistently delicious  she makes the best fries n gravy - burgers taste so good"}
{"text":"The dollar doesn't go as far as it used to,. Pizza village delivers quality food that doesn't break the bank. You can get a generous portion of poutine with just $5.

It has a cozy set up sandwiched between a subway and the money mart, so it's not something I would walk buy during my day to day but I decided to give it a try after a friend referring me to this place for a quick fix on hearty food. I tried the poutine and I got the fish, they do all sorts of foods likes burgers, slovaki to your fish and chips.

The poutine was amazing, it's got a home made feel to it. There was a generous amount of gravy and cheese which I prefer and it is at a very reasonably priced. The fish was very nicely battered and fluffy as I would hope to expect when ordering fish. I was in and out of the place in 10 minutes.

If your looking for a quick fix while preserving the money I would highly recommend you give this place a try"}
{"text":"Don't let the past reviews fool you. My first instinct was to try this place out, 4 and a 1/2 stars, how could you go wrong? Upon arriving I began second guessing if this was the same place described in the past reviews. I then started investigating and realized that all the reviews were written within a few days of each other. Not only did this feel like fake reviews, but three of the five reviewers are friends on Yelp, I mean come on.

The food wasn't anything special. If you're looking for something affordable and to fill your gut, then this place does exactly that. Would I go again? Maybe? After realizing I had been duped by fake reviews it left me feeling scammed and not wanting to return regardless of the food. The service was sub par as the woman making my food left to watch TV as my food cooked, again nothing special. 

To put it simply, when I finished my food I had wished that I had gone somewhere else. This place is definitely not a \"Gem\" as another reviewer put it."}
{"text":"I've tried this place for the first time many years ago and I remembered it being tasty, hardy and a great value. 
Well this past weekend I finally got around to going back and eating the food again and it was exactly how I remembered it. This joint is at an extremely convenient location and the whole places gives off a down-to-earth and friendly vibe. 

On to the food:
I had the home burger, the wrap (shared it with a friend) and the poutine. 
The burger was very good and fresh. I love burgers that taste home-made! It was a huge burger and I couldn't even finish it on my own. The patty was definitely my favourite part, it tasted well balanced and reminded me of summer bbq's. 
The pita wrap was very good for a place called village pizza, it was again large in size and the meat was cooked very well. 
Now the poutine was definitely my favourite! I loveeeee thick fries, and these ones were definitely cooked to the perfect texture! The gravy combined with the cheese curbs were well proportioned and it was very delicious."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and amazing food for a great price! Poutine & chicken souvlaki highly recommended."}
