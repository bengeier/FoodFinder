{"text":"Better than Schwartz and Dunns. Definitely coming back when I'm in town. Will try the smoked duck next time. 

Got the poutine and it was perfect individual sized bowl. There was only on waitress but service was very good.  Decor is a flash from the past but it's clean. I'm here for the good food"}
{"text":"Generous portions - Good Value.
Staff was attentive and efficient.
Food came out quickly and was at ideal temperature to start feasting!
Have visited previously and will be back again."}
{"text":"Saw this place beside Dunn's and read some good reviews and decided to try.  What an awesome find!  Ordered the large smoked meat combo with Poutine for $16.95.  The meat was full of flavour and the fat melted with every bite.  I actually prefer this texture over Schwartz's...Schwartz's meat crumbles too much hand even has a bitter after taste...but hey...to each their own.  This will be my go to place for smoked meat when I come to Montreal."}
{"text":"Reviews here didn't disappoint. I went there a few days ago to try their smoked meat sandwich but couldn't stay bcs something had came up. I ordered two smoked chickens instead for Saturday and left. A note; they'd need 2-3 days notice for any of their whole poultry orders. To purchase, marinate and then to smoke them.

I returned a few days later to try but after seeing their lunch special and its affordable price compared to the rest on their regular menu, I ordered their chop chop spaghetti topped with smoked meat. It was something I've never had before and was also a way to try the quality of their smoked meat while saving a few bucks. For some reason, I wasn't feeling wealthy that day lol. 

Healthy portion with 5 slices of moist tender rye bread accompanied with whipped butter. After a few bites which I enjoyed but since I like things hot and spicy, I added some crushed peppers and the rest is just a memorable sweet history. All that for $10! Very reasonable and very good quality food. 

With no hesitation, I'd give this place a 5 star but taking down one for the following two, not so major reasons. I wonder why the gentleman at the counter who took my order asked me the time of the pick up for the chickens. One would assume that's bcs you will be getting what you ordered hot out of the oven or smoker right? Turns out there is no reason. When I picked up the chickens, the containers were cold so when asked him what's up with that, he says they finished smoking them in the morning and then they've been sitting in the fridge since then. Hmmm, I wish I was told about this when ordering so I could synch my time well with the side dishes we'd prepared to eat with the chickens. We lost a good 45 minutes between warming up the oven and finishing warming the chicken. 

Second, although the taste of the chicken was different and awesome, the other reason for the knocked down star would be for some of the spots deep inside the chicken left pinkish, almost red and a bit rubbery. An indication of a chicken escaping the full cooking process earlier than usual. We had to reintroduce our chicken to our oven and cook it for another 30 minutes. 

In general, I would think of this place in nice ways and definitely would return but would advice them to leave my chickens a few minutes longer in the oven or smoker. They were pretty good and worth the try. Good find overall."}
{"text":"One of the best Ruben sandwich's I've ever eaten. Hats off, these are some of the best smoked meats just outside Montr√©al. Great people and great food. Yum, yum."}
{"text":"Wanted to try poutine and smoked meat since they are classic Canadian dishes!  I love that it was a local haunt and not touristy at all!  It was quiet being Monday,  we were one of two tables, the other being a local old guy!  The food was really good and did not disappoint. Not a fancy place by any means, but a simple and satisfying meal!! Really good experience!"}
{"text":"Georges Deli is an excellent option for those of us simply not willing to drive into Montreal to get your hands on some quality smoked meat. This joint screams \"I'm a Mom & Pop owned deli!!!\". The waiters/waitresses as well as the resto decor pretty much confirms that much.

Their jumbo smoked meat can be a challenge for some with the regular portion eligible to be considered pretty generous as well. The smoked meat is flavorful with little fat to it and sometimes... fat is a good thing! While I usually like my smoked meat lean, I do recommend medium as lean can be drier than usual here. The side fries were great, with the coleslaw mix and pickle keeping deli tradition strong. 

Service was quick and friendly.

All in all, a solid bang for your buck in cost to quality and definitely somewhere I'd re-visit occasionally."}
{"text":"Great smoked meat, fast service and friendly. The meat was one of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Well it's simple this smoke meat is better than Schwartz hands down. You can pop in plenty of room no line up outside, no hurry up and get out feeling like at Schwartz. Staff super friendly and place is clean. Now for the smoke meat I took medium and it was delicious. It was succulent and just the right amount of fat which melted in your mouth. Came with a huge pickle, fries and coleslaw which was equally tasty. Over all for $15 it is worth it. Good job George see you soon."}
{"text":"George's was recommended by smoke meat lovers & I decided to give it s shot. We got there at 8h45 & we realized theyclose at9h00 pm. Then staff was very nice& inviting, they invited us in & got our orders. You guessed it was Smoke meat of course! Medium was recommended. As you can see in the pics the sandwich was enormous, the meat was good but a bit dry. French fries were awesome & not greasy like certain restaurants. My only disappointment was the coleslaw salad. For a place where the specialty is SM you better have a good coleslaw to accompany it. Overall, the place is authentic, feels like you've come home."}
{"text":"Georges is a hidden treasure.  I've been coming here since 2007 and tonight I met up with a friend for a famous smoked meat sandwich and coleslaw.  The legend goes is that the owner use to work at Schwartz's or has some relation to being involved with Schwartz's in the past.  I would say that the smoked meat is seriously on par with Schwartz's!  I know this is a bold statement.  Come check for yourself!  I've taken home whole brisket's back to my hometown and they will pack them for travel for you.  They charge by the pound and the brisket's are usually 9 - 13 pounds each!  When I was there tonight I saw they were smoking duck, turkey's and chicken's also!  I know there are tons of places for soaked meat in the greater Montreal confines,  but close to my home this is my go to place!"}
{"text":"Thank you thank you thank you thank you Yelpers!! What an amazing find this deli is. Old school decor, amazing service, delicious smoked meat sandwiches, crunchy french fries and onion rings, and yes even Cott Cherry coke. Simply amazing, delicious food. I agree with the others, why go to Schwartz when you can come here, find plenty of parking, and actually take your time and enjoy your meal? 

My family is hooked! Thanks George (yes he still works in the kitchen!) and staff for an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"The smoke meat tastes delicious. large portions at a reasonable price. I have found that ordering the meat \"medium fat\", yes I said fat, is the best combination of taste moisture and satisfaction. Quiet local place, so don't expect any \"wow\" factor when you walk in"}
{"text":"Who needs schwartz when we have Geroges!!! Hidden treasure yes, most do not even know this place. But I am a regular here living in laval unless I bring visitors from out of town, then we go for the real McCoy. 

Rumors are that this restaurant was suppose to be a schwartz but just before opening Schwartz was being audited by the government and George wanted no part of that and just opened under his name. Even the logo is the same. 

Good for him!!!


I will be back."}
