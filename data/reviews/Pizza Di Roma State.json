{"text":"Delivery order - 55 minutes for delivery which is fine. Ordered a stuffed spinach pizza, garlic bread and fries. Pizza and bread were delicious, fries a little soggy. Delivery boy was cute and very nice  Overall very satisfied !"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Madison, better than Ian's and Glass Nickel and Greenbush (that's what that basement place on Regent is called, right?).  Big floppy slices that you've got to fold, and that nice orange grease oozes out and drips down your arm.  Sprinkle on some parmesan, get a coke, tuck a napkin in your collar and dig in.    I'd say that a cheese slice will set you back $2.50 or so, and the more elaborate pizzas get up to around $6.00 a slice.  Barbecue Chicken pizza is a favorite with this humble yelper, and I think you'll like it too.  Free delivery in the downtown area (but tip well as always!)  Open late"}
{"text":"Roaches. Freakin ROACHES!!!. They were literally crawling over a slice behind the counter. RoACheS. I told my friend and she said one crawled over her friends pizza at the table. Sick. Plus the food is kind of gross anyway."}
{"text":"Convenient and rapid delivery. The insalata is relatively fresh, penne marinara savory though a little bit oily with mediocre desert of strawberry cheese cake. Overall about average."}
{"text":"I'm putting 3 stars bc I love PDR. BUT I had a terrible experience last week. The patrons in line behind us were such assholes it makes me sad that such a great establishment would attract literally the scum of the earth but unfortunately that's what happened. Anyway love the pizza but I wish they stood up for their loyal customers when push comes to shove..."}
{"text":"This place should have a higher score. 4 stars minimum IMO. I don't usually like NY style pizza and thought this was fantastic. BBQ chicken was incredible. Sausage Pepperoni very good as well. Caprese least favorite thing we tried, but still very solid.  Honestly, i was skeptical given the overall condition of the restaurant, but the pizza is truly legit. Noticed they were tossing fresh dough in the back. Tough to find good pizza in Madison, but this is one of the best options."}
{"text":"decent pizza depending on when you head in (sometimes the pie has clearly been sitting there for awhile).  There isn't that much good pizza by the slice in Madison and this will do the trick in a pinch, but don't expect anything special"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a big delicious slice of pizza, you're better off going to where they do it best: Ian's.   PDR is basically the same concept as Ian's, the Madison staple that is a MUST try for any out-of-towners. PDR's pizza is the same size and about the same price, but it's not nearly as flavorful. Every time I've gotten a slice here, it's been dry and bland. The staff is average--I've really only ever been super impressed by friendliness and helpfulness of the staff one time. At certain times though, they'll give you free samples of whatever the chef is currently working on, which is a nice little \"appetizer\" while you're waiting for your pizza to be done.   PDR has recently become the \"hipster\" place to go (I guess Ian's is becoming too \"mainstream\"), but I'd still gladly wait in the line running out of the Ian's door if I had the time. If you're dining with a group, you'll find more seating here than at the Frances St. Ian's, but the State St. Ian's is better than PDR for large groups because you can actually all sit at one table (here they just have a lot of 4-seater booths)."}
{"text":"Best NY style pizza in Madison.  Best pizza in madison, hand's down.  And don't start in about Glass Nickel or Toppers or some other crap...Pizza di knows how to do it"}
{"text":"Although I don't have a difficult time believing both poor and positive reviews for this place, I can only remark on my own experience.  With that said my chicken, tomatoe, and garlic pizza was really good! The place was a bit of a dump but the food was yummy. I also got garlic rolls that were nice and soft with a tasty marinara dipping sauce and a ceaser salad that was nothing great. Just lettuce croutons and some store bought dressing probably, but it was healthyish :-)  I would definately recommend this based on this experience here. In fact I liked it a bit more than Ian's (I did not expect that)!  I did think the price was a little high for per slice but doing there speacial deals brought the price where I liked when buying a full pizza.  So, go here. Its good greasy cheesy yummy pizza."}
{"text":"Good New York style slice that would be an acceptable, if not standout, option back in New York. Still, the quality seems to have gone down a little in the last few years. Less sauce, more grease. I prefer Ian's, but Pizza di Roma is still a good option. A little on the expensive side -- almost $3 for a slice -- but they're big slices."}
{"text":"If you're craving a slice of New York style pizza, this is the only place for you to go in Madison.  I'm not saying the pizza is going to change your life - but I do believe that if you were to somehow pick up Pizza Di Roma and relocate it to Manhattan, you'd never know this was a pizza place from the Midwest.  And that's a compliment (an average slice of pizza in New York is usually better than a slice from anywhere else). The atmosphere, service, and flavors will make you feel like you're back in New York.  I'd recommend it over Ian's any day."}
{"text":"I ordered through Grubhub...twice. The first time, I went to pick it up and as I got to my car, I looked in the bag and realized they forgot my main entree. How the #$%^ do you miss the main entree? The second time, they forgot my garlic roll, cracked peppers, and parmesanl. My linguine was very bland and didn't even bother finishing it, just threw it out. My buddy ordered from the same place and they forgot his garlic bread and slice of pizza. He threw out his chicken linguine. Pizzas were good, that's basically it. Anything else, it's either bland, too salty, or you didn't even get the order."}
{"text":"A person definitely has there choice of pizza by the slice on state street and pizza di roma is one that has been there for sometime. I have frequently be there for lunch when I am working downtown and I've never been disappointed.  The business has a long standing tradition of New York style pizza, you know the slice you have to fold in half. In my recent visit I purchased the lasagna pizza and I was more than happy that I stopped. It left me wanting more."}
{"text":"I give this a meh, only because the quality of the pizza seems to be declining.  I'd always loved Pizza Di Roma for its New York pizza quality and taste.  I don't know if the owner has moved on, or what, but the recipe seems to be changing.  I also received a cold and stale pie from EatStreet last week. I'm really going to mourn if the only New York style pizza in Madison -if not the whole state of Wisconsin- has passed."}
{"text":"Very great pizza and other food, but they dont give silverware on their deliveries.  Otherside would have been a 5-star review"}
{"text":"Go there every time I get the pizza craving while traversing State St. The spinach pizza is to die for, Double YUM! Slices are embarrassing huge."}
{"text":"Got a couple calzones from here and they were good. Not like incredible or anything, but definitely good. I'm new to Madison and trying new places out. I would probably go back here for a slice of pizza sometime."}
{"text":"Closest thing we have in Madison to a solid old school neighborhood NY pizza joint you'd find all around the NYC tri-state area.   Looking for a solid classic slice? Visit Pizza D. Looking for a shiney pizza restaurant with a marketing team and/or a head chef catering to their weird millennial crowd putting wild stuff on their pizza? You are in the wrong place."}
{"text":"I was in town on vacation and got the ravioli for dinner. About 6 hours later I was barfing my brains out. Idk if the cheese was bad or what but beware the ravioli. My boyfriend got the chicken parm and was fine though. Just my luck I suppose."}
{"text":"Usually come for pizza but decided one day to try pasta. The penne ala vodka was great!!!!! Was not sure what to expect but it highly exceeded expectations. They have a hooked deal on Monday nights for any pasta $7.99. Such a great deal!!! Would recommend :)"}
{"text":"Whenever I am in the mood for pizza, this is the first place I think of.  They reheat each slice before they serve it which makes the crust wonderfully crispy while still being flexible.  My favorite varieties are the caprese and the barbeque chicken.  Both are outstanding."}
{"text":"Pizza Di Roma is awesome! Sure, the building might be... not nice, but the pizza makes up for everything. If you're on State Street, make sure to come here."}
{"text":"This is your standard pan pizza.  The crust of this pizza tastes like any other pizza I've had and it was good.  $4 got me a huge slice of pepperoni mushroom pizza.  I enjoyed every bite.  Lots of toppings and cheese.  Pretty yum.    There's a TV in the back that showed a Lakers game that you watch on connected plastic style picnic tables and benches."}
{"text":"How do you rate zero stars? Out of everything INCLUDING GARLIC ROLLS. very disappointing. Never coming back. So rude with the response too."}
{"text":"Pizza by the slice that's just as good as Ian's - and depending on your mood, sometimes way better. The options are more traditional American-Italian, and the ingredients are all pretty standard in terms of quality and creativity. But for the same cost as a specialty slice elsewhere, you can get a ridiculously huge slice that is a meal in itself.  I get the baked ziti slice every time I come here and have yet to be dissatisfied. The texture of the pizza is especially unique - the crust is a perfect combination of soft and flavorful. Combine that with a sauce on the ziti that appears to be made from crack, and this makes one of the best fast-food Italian places in town.  Gyros ain't bad either, surprisingly."}
{"text":"The pizza is not good. I don't know how they survive with Ian's and Salvatore's. Fine people and all but the dough, cheese, sauce, and toppings were not good. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza di Roma an hour and 10 minutes before closing and never received my food.  I waited and waited and called into the restaurant and never received my food.  I was assured it was on the way and had been picked up, but nevertheless it did not ever get delivered.  My family went hungry as pizza di Roma was the only place open. This is the worst example of customer service. The guy on the phone did not care and I never received my food. My family went hungry.  Don't ever order Pizza di Roma. They will not deliver your food. Up yours"}
{"text":"I was too lazy to leave my hotel and my stomach told me it was time to eat and pizza was on my mind.  Unfortunately not all pizza joints will deliver to a hotel. This one did! I ordered for delivery through Yelp which was pretty easy to do.  After making my order I was told that I could download an app to keep track of my order.  I tried that out and it was pretty spot on for how long they said it would take, plus you could track to see if the driver left and how far they are from you.  They even came up to my hotel room and delivered the pizza.  I bought a  20 inch pizza which was basically eight huge slices that I was full just eating two.  Lets just say I also had pizza for breakfast....and lunch....and a snack...."}
{"text":"Just finished having my pizza and caesar salad which I had delivered. I really wish I would have gone with my first instinct and had ordered from Falbo's. Got the pizza and salad within the delivery estimate (40 mins or so). My pizza slice was extremely soggy. I ordered the supreme which had veggies, sausage, and pepperoni. None of my toppings would've stayed on had I lifted the slice. I was forced to use a knife and fork because the pizza just would not hold up. My caesar salad was just as bad. The dressing was very thin and watery. I'm Still hungry! Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I'm upping the rating of this place after coming here a second time.  Before leaving Madison to conclude my mini \"pizza tour\" I decided to stop at Ians.  I was not impressed in the least (see my 1 star review) and decided to head back to this place to get dinner.  Both to get a decent slice of pizza and also to get some Italian subs to take back with me to Columbus (see my previous review of this place for a review on that sub).  Yes their Italian sub was just so good I decided that, right before leaving I would come back to Pizza Di Roma and get 4 subs to take back with me to Columbus.  At $7.95 a sub they are not cheap but worth every penny.  I've eaten at a ton of pizza shops in my 42 years on the planet and gotten an Italian sub at every one that offered one and have yet to find anything as unique and delicious as what they offer at Pizza Di Roma.  So this time I decided to try the traditional New York Style pizza with the toppings I always use as a comparative \"baseline\" so to speak.  That baseline, which I usually order to judge all New York style pizza places upon is: Pepperoni, mushroom, onion and extra cheese. So I ordered my 4 subs to go and while doing so decided to also try their Ham and Cheese sub as well.  And then while ordering my \"baseline\" pizza decided to try their Barbecue chicken and bacon pizza.    First things first, their baseline pizza is superb.  The slice with pepperoni, mushroom, onion and extra cheese was fantastic.  I mean about as good as it gets for New York Style pizza.  Add a dash of garlic powder to the slice and it's heaven.  I honestly don't know how anyone can give this pizza place less than 4 stars based upon this slice alone.  The barbecue, chicken and bacon pizza was also fantastic.  The bacon was crisp, the chicken, while not too plentiful was decent and the barbecue was nice and sweet.  The slice is VERY heavy as in you only need ONE slice to fill you up.  In fact I ended up cutting off pieces of this and eating it over three settings it's such a heavy slice.  It's also no doubt saturated with transfat and the like so this one should be a rare joy.  I loved it though and that's saying because I don't really go off the \"beaten path\" for pizza in regards to non-traditional pizzas.    Lastly the Ham and Cheese sub looked great when I opened it (see pic) and was utterly delicious from the small part I sampled.  I say small part as I was filled up with pizza.  However the sub was much like the Italian, the bread tasted homemade, not frozen and the meat and cheese top of the line.  There is also plenty of fresh vegetables in there as well which gives you a small ability to kid yourself you ate somewhat healthy.  All in all it's simply shameful in my opinion this place isn't rated higher on here.  The help is quite friendly both times I came to the shop despite it being quite busy.  They indulged all of my pizza talk about their styles of pizza as well as their competition.  I cannot say enough great things about this place, if Ians is highly overrated on Yelp this place is highly underrated, ESPECIALLY their sub sandwiches.  Take my advice, if you want New York style pizza this is the place to go in Madison!"}
{"text":"This is a review for delivery that was placed via GrubHub.  While travelling you always need a solid pizza meal. We decided to go with Pizza Di Roma since they have gotten good reviews and lots of options on their menu.   We ordered a 14\" pepperoni pizza and chicken wings. Our food came very fast and the delivery guy was very nice. The pizza was easily devoured by my girlfriend and I with no leftovers. We were pretty hungry from not eating all day but I would still suggest getting the next size up if you're ordering for more than two people.  The pizza was quite tasty. I'd say it's better than your average thin crust. The pizza sauce was sadly scarce but it was still very flavorful. The chicken wings came with buffalo sauce, ranch dressing and blue cheese dressing which we bought separately. Having the different sauces on the side was a cool way to eat.   I would definitely order from here again and I'm looking forward to trying their other dishes."}
{"text":"Probably the worst experience I have ever had ordering from a restaurant.  I order and it was late I called to get an update they said it would be there in 15 minutes and hung up on me.  Another hour later I called back to check in again they told me the delivery driver had it and gave me his number.  He said he didn't have it, I called the store back they said it would be the next one to leave the store.  When I asked them to read me back the order I had, the person on the phone just said I have no idea.  I asked to speak to a manager and they said there wasn't one.  Told me if the food never shows up to just call the following day to get a refund, and hung up again."}
{"text":"Good if you want really bad and super greasy pizza after hitting the bars, but if you want something that tastes the way pizza should taste, go elsewhere.  Good for hangovers, but not much else."}
{"text":"I love this place! I grew up in the NY/NJ area, and when I first tasted Pizza Di Roma, I felt like I was back on the East Coast. I know that Ian's is great, and it has become the official pizza of the revolution, but really, Pizza Di Roma is great pizza. Tremendous variety - this crispy crust and glorious toppings."}
{"text":"Pretty big individual slices of thin crust pizza that work well for a quick meal on State Street.  This place would be a solid 3.5 star spot if that was an option. There is usually not a long line, which makes it a good spot if you need food right away. I feel fairly neutral about the place and most of the slices. I tried the BBQ chicken pizza once and found the chicken to be dry. One slice I do really like is the spinach and feta cheese pizza."}
{"text":"Not a bad pizza place. You can always come here if the lines at Ian's are too long.   I don't recommend buying pizzas by the slices here since they are relatively expensive. But if you take out or dine in with a group and get a whole pizza to share, it'll be pretty worth it. I like the fact that this place offers 20-inch pizzas. I'm always game for a bigger fill of pizza.   Pizza Di Roma isn't usually that busy, so you'd be able to find seating or order pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Closed Early.... was not informed by Yelp's delivery ordering service until right around when the order should have been delivered.... Not acceptable. Apparently, comunnication is not this restaurant's strong suit."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good. My girlfriend enjoys the pasta and salads. Unfortunately they are 0-2 when it comes to deliveries. Last two orders they have forgotten the ranch and the most recent order they sent out the wrong pasta dish after confirming twice. However, mistakes were corrected promptly which is why I am willing to continue ordering and would be happy to adjust my review."}
{"text":"Seriously love pdr! Amazing supreme pizza. Skip Ian's long late night line and go straight to pizza de Roma!"}
{"text":"I dont' like pizza, but I can still appreciate this place.  They have heaping portions of pasta and the biggest slices of flat-crust traditional pizza that I have ever seen with everything you can imagine on them.  Great for a quick bite, affordable, with fast-food like seating.  A drunken favorite late at night for pizza by the slice. 4 stars."}
{"text":"Not bad for a quick slice. I wanted Ian's badly, but my friend recommended PDR, assuring me we'd have our slices in less than 5 minutes and he was right! The decor inside is pretty blah, I couldn't help but feel like I was in middle school sitting inside an old Burger King. The spinach and feta slice was yummy. I was probably in and out of that place in 10 minutes. I gobble slices down like it's nobody's business."}
{"text":"In short: I'd go back.  Totally, totally decent pizza. Nowhere near as good as Cafe Porta Alba, but definitely better than the crapfest that is Glass Nickel. I ordered a 14\" cheese pie, my typical pre-finals unhealthy food of choice. Plus: They accidentally gave me a 20\" pie. Plus: They gave me garlic rolls. My roommates were happy.  Honestly? It's about as close to NY Pizza as you're going to get here. Adequately greasy, easily foldable, solid crust. Not as crazy as Ian's, but still pretty good.  I approve, Pizza Di Roma. I whole-heartedly approve."}
{"text":"I actually like this place better than Ian's for a late-night pizza on or near State Street.  It's your more classic New York-style, greasy pizza that comes in huge slices. It's not as crowded as Ian's, so you'll actually get to sit down, and the pizza is good if you enjoy the NY-style.    I've actually come here occasionally when it wasn't after midnight. I came here once for a post-5K carb reload (so delicious and greasy! just what my body needed!) and also on the way home from an evening out elsewhere.    It's your great classic pizza place, and one of the things I miss about not being in Madison!"}
{"text":"I really do love the pizza. I'm a big fan of the thin hand tossed crust. But the delivery is SNAIL LIKE. Expect at least an hour even durning an in busy time. And I don't like far! My last pizza came half crushed, 1.5 after I ordered. It still tasted good but very disappointed."}
{"text":"You know, a couple of months ago, I would have given Pizza Di Roma only 3 stars.  But, after eating some of the shittiest late night pizza in Chicago ever, I think Pizza Di Roma is tasting pretty good!  I work nights, and as one of the few places in Madison that doesn't close at 9 or 10, we order from here a lot.  We usually always get the spinach and feta pizza which never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Terrible, awful sandwiches. Seriously gross.  The pizza looks tasty (but looks can be deceiving)."}
{"text":"There's better greasy pizza to be had when you're drunk and craving food that's bad for you (particularly now that there's an Ian's on State St).  I might consider this pizza almost inedible if not drunk."}
{"text":"Casa Bianca was some of the best thin crust pizza I've ever had.  They had a couple locations, two closed, the last became Pizza di Roma.  I was slightly disappointed, as Pizza di Roma wasnt quite as good.  However, I couldnt find anything better as far as New York thin crust in this area, so I kept going back.  I was in New York recently for the first time in years, and was dead set on finding the best pizza within a reasonable distance from my hotel, and bringing an entire pie back home with me.  I surveyed every New Yorker in Brooklyn, and quite surprisingly, every single one had the same recommendation.  \"You gotta go to Gino's\".  On the way back to my room, pizza in hand, this New York archetype scowled at my pizza box \"You shoulda gone to Gino's\".  I said, this is Gino's.  \"Oh you're good then!\".  When I tried the Gino's it was very good, but nothing distinguished it from Pizza di Roma to me.  So I brought it back home and compared the two.  They were almost exactly the same.  Since then I've looked at Pizza di Roma with new respect.  For what it's worth, I always get pepperoni and sausage (and that's what I get everywhere else as well).  I also frequently get the garlic knots.  PdR gets extra points for being open late, points subtracted for having one of the most depressing dining areas of anywhere in Madison.  Staff is friendly, in a surly and sometimes non english speaking sort of way."}
{"text":"I've always loved their pizza and their penne ala vodka, but they just added a ton of vegan options too which is insanely cool! I'm trying to go vegan and the fact that they have these options makes me so excited. They also do gluten free pasta at no extra charge."}
{"text":"PDR is pretty dope. It definitely has character, from the tacky blue-green booths and tables to the fake, shitty paintings of Italian scenery on the walls. No matter if you love or hate the setting, the pizza here is excellent and reminiscent of a New York slice: thin and crunchy-doughy crust, light/sweet sauce, plenty of cheese, and most importantly, a huge portion. Equivalent to Ian's for a late-night slice, if not better for having lotsa booth seating! Bless u PDR. Love, the college kids."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I don't care what people tell you, this place has the best pizza in Madison.  The have the best crust I have ever had.  It has a nice crunch with every bite you take.  The toppings are fresh and delicious.  Its the total package!"}
{"text":"The pizza was decent NY style pizza, we got just plain cheese so can't talk to their specialty Pizza but the pizza was pretty good but the star of the meal was the carrot cake which was surprisingly very good. Delivery was 45 minutes on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Madison if you're getting pizza, and by pizza I mean plain, pepperoni, or something simple. That foo foo stuff at Ian's, i.e. Mac and cheese, cheesesteak, cheeseburger, chicken cordon bleu, etc, isn't pizza. PDR makes slices like those to appease the idiots that like that stuff, and yeah it's not that good at PDR, because it's not that good in general. If you know and love pizza, get your pizza here. It's the best pizza in Madison."}
{"text":"Even with the sub-par reviews I tried it out (mostly because of the great Italian sub review).  We got the Italian sub and chicken parm.  The sub was alright, not bad, but nothing great.  Maybe if you've never had balsamic before you'd be blown away, but it just wan't anything special to me.  The chicken parm... was far and beyond the worst thing I've attempted to eat.  I hate when a restaurant burns something but lets it slide... like I'm not going to notice the charred flavor because you completely cover it in cheese?  I didn't have great expectations going in, just wanted to eat something a little comforting.  What I received was  SUCH a disappointment.  Like I said, COVERED in cheese, I could hardly find the pasta.  The noodles and sauce were OK... not the worst I've had, but not good.  The breading on the chicken tasted of just burnt breadcrumbs and grease and the chicken... hard to describe.  It was impossible to cut through with my fork (bad sign) and when I tried to pull it apart the meat separated like string cheese!  It  was so dry I couldn't even pull it apart in some places and yet seemed under-cooked in others.  I only had two bites of the chicken, because the texture really worried me and I couldn't stand the thought of eating another bite after that."}
{"text":"I wish there was more stars. I could eat pizza every single day, but now Pizza Di Roma has ruined me and nothing compares. Huge slices that are cheap. Big selection (I recommend the spinach). WAY better than Ian's imo, with a much shorter line to wait in. Can't recommend enough!!"}
{"text":"I ordered an eggplant parm sandwich and fries for delivery. They came a half hour faster than Grub Hub estimated, which was great, and the delivery guy was friendly. My sandwich was HUGE--I'm talking twice the size of any other eggplant parm I'd ever had before, must have been 12 inches--but it was little soggy and wasn't very flavorful. The fries were a huge portion as well, though they were soggy too, but this could be because they were delivery.   For the price and convenience, this place is pretty okay! I'll still be searching for that perfect eggplant parm hero though..."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I love all of the by-the-slice pizzas I've had. My favorite is currently the mac'n'cheese. I think it's better than Ian's and have argued for many hours over it with friends. My old favorite was the BBQ chicken. I think I got a free slice of cheese from the Moocho app that wasn't very good, but with a selection like Pizza Di Roma's why would you get cheese?  My absolute favorite thing here is the calamari. They easily have the best calamari I've ever had. I hate the tentacle parts and they're always more than happy to not give them to me whenever I ask. Which is very appreciated as I just find them weird (I know it's silly).  I've gotten delivery a few times and it's always warm when I get it. It can take a bit longer than other delivery  places I've noticed, but it's not enough of a difference for me to care.  They've only gotten a few of my orders wrong and considering how this is one of my top three most frequented places, that's not bad. They're always nice when they have to fix a problem.  I don't like sitting in the restaurant. It has a lot more to do with the people who go there and the fact that I only eat there late night. I just don't like listening to drunk frat guys talk about the women they're screwing. I imagine during the day it's fine. The place is nice looking and clean. Plus the murals are really pretty."}
{"text":"This is the way pizza was meant to be!! Huge, New York style slices sooooo good!  I prefer Di Roma to the more popular Ian's down the street. I have never tried any other menu items here because I love the pizza so much. My favorite is probably the baked ziti pizza, but there are a lot of delicious slices to choose from."}
{"text":"Got in here at 2:58 AM as they were closing up for the night. regardless of time I received amazing service from the front staff and the slices I had were great. I ordered a mac n cheese slice along with a plain slice. My only problem was the selection was very limited when I walked in. Next time I won't make the mistake of coming 2 minutes before closing"}
{"text":"Pizza Di Roma is Italian for the baddest ass pizza in all of Wisconsin. By the slice or by the pie, this place is legit!"}
{"text":"Must visit in Madison.  Vegetarian heaven.  Free water cup right behind you."}
{"text":"I tend to find myself at PdR only when I'm in the company of others - even when I lived down the street in college, my visits were always at the suggestion of another. They are great at what they do, but no matter what time I'm there I can't help but feel like I stumbled through the door in a 2:30am need-drunk-food haze.   A little update to the decor, and, perhaps more importantly, a good deep cleaning of the entire establishment, would go a long way to making me feel like it was a good choice for dinner. I'm not looking for white linens or dim lighting - I understand that it's a quick and cheap pizza place where a little scratch takes you a long way - but maybe they could wipe the chunks of pizza sauce of the walls?  That being said, the half slice of pizza I ate on my last visit was quite tasty and better quality than I remembered from my previous trips. I tried the barbecue chicken slice that my boyfriend couldn't finish, and was pleased to find tender pulled chicken topping the slice instead of chunks. There was a lot of flavor without being particularly spicy or sweet (not that I'd have minded, but that's often the predominant note on a BBQ pizza). The slices are as big as your face, and one could probably satiate the average diner. With a little elbow grease, I think I could be persuaded that Pizza di Roma is a four-star experience."}
{"text":"Incredibly underrated! Delicious pizza in huge portions, reasonable prices and fast friendly service. Also less crowded than some other similar places."}
{"text":"FINALLY found a NY style pizza place in Madison that is delicious.  Thin chewy crust, good sauce, nice thick cheese and toppings, bends when you pick it up, and GASP, is cut into slices not squares.  I give it a 4/5, and it will be the only pizza place I order from in Madison from now on.  This is the first food review I have ever written so that should tell you something about my pizza mission here in Madison and that this place is very good.    I moved here just about a year ago from CT, and have been trying out various Italian places to find something that resembles the pizza I love back home.  Never thought it would be so hard, but I guess good pizza is hard to find out here.    The first pizza place I tried, The Pizza Pit...I had never heard of it, and now I know why, WOW horrible....if you'd like to eat something that tastes like sauced cardboard, go here.  I threw the leftovers out...never a good sign, I LOVE leftovers.  I have no idea how they remain in business.    Second place I tried was Glass Nickel Pizza...I got a coupon in the mail, so there ya go.  Pizza is decent but not NY style by any means.  Crust is thicker and toppings are scarce.    Third place I tried after a friends recommendation was Cafe La Bellitalia.  I ordered the thin crust wondering if thats what you had to order in Madison to get NY style pizza.  Blech no, was the crunchy wafer like crust, ruined further by being cut into squares.  Maybe their regular pizza is better.    Fourth place I tried cause I thought it might be interesting was Papa Murphy's Pizza.  This pizza was actually very good.  Its a take and bake thing, and the pizza is very tasty, high quality ingredients, really good sausage.  However, not NY style.  But was so far, the best pizza I had found.  I ordered from here a few times.    Fifth place I tried was the Roman Candle.  Pizza was pizza, nothing amazing, but good enough.  Again a thicker crust and not the classic heavy topping NY style I was looking for.    Sixth place I tried was The Pizza Oven after purchasing a Living Social Deal.  I was hopeful about this place as it got good reviews and has been around for a while.  Pizza was pretty good, however once again major docked points for cutting the pizza into small squares, and having wafer like crust.  Ugh.    Then I tried Pizza di Roma.  WINNER, my search is over.  I got sausage, pepperoni and mushroom 18\".  Price is whats expected, but for me the pizza seemed very large.  My boyfriend and I had lots of leftovers.  We both loved it and it took all the willpower in the world to not eat it for every meal the next day, only two out of the three, hehe."}
{"text":"Pizza Di Roma is terrible.  At any given time of the day the vast majority of the pizza that is sold by the slice will have been made hours and hours ago.  Don't bother asking the staff-- they will lie and tell you that it is fresh.  Trust your eyes-- most of the time you are buying reheated pizza that wasn't all that good in the first place.  Their appetizers and entrees are pretty bad too.   Chicken marsala is bland as can be and comes with a pathetic, skimpy little side of pasta.  Service is also slow-- why does it take 30 mins for a takeout order?  God I wish there was a decent pizza place in this town."}
{"text":"I don't know why I bother coming here every time I come here to get a few slices with family i never get bbq chicken. They never have any made. Tonight very limited choices asked if the could make it nope. Every e gets there pizza since pepperoni and chesse.is always available.   Really sucks wasted trip to down town"}
{"text":"Great pizza by the huge, foldable slice, and calzones that can be clearly seen from orbit."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza for Wisconsin. Being a Chicagoan, I'm definitely a pizza perfectionist, but for a thin crust, by the slice pizza joint this place was about as good as it gets. There were a ton of options for ready to eat slices, and the staff was pretty friendly as well. I'd have given 5 stars, but c'mon, let's be real, it's still no Chicago pie, great attempt and delicious to boot. I'd say order two slices before you make up your mind about pizza Di Roma"}
{"text":"We ordered a spinach and feta pizza from here and it was SO good. I've had spinach and feta pizza other places and I like it ok, but it's generally not something I get really excited over. This pizza was incredible. It had a very light alfredo sauce on it - just enough so you could taste it but not so much that it made the crust soggy or overwhelmed the other flavors. I also liked that it had mozzarella cheese on it too since feta has a strong flavor and can be overwhelming in large quantities. We had delivery and it arrived reasonably quickly and was very hot."}
{"text":"As a New Yorker, I'm a big snob about pizza. Fortunately, Pizza di Roma lives up to my standards. Slices are big, the cheese to sauce ratio is right, and the crust is a good thickness/consistency. When pizza is good, there's no need to get a specialty slice (*cough*ians), cheese or pepperoni will do. The spinach slice is also yummy.  Would definitely recommend this over anywhere else in town, during the day or late night."}
{"text":"Was craving pizza late at night and found this place. I ordered a slice of cheese and it was amazing. Just what I needed. The crust was delicious.  Prices are reasonable. Will recommend and will return again."}
{"text":"they raised the prices of a single slice of cheese to 3.25,  this was supposed to a cheap alternative to ian's and stuff. will not be back"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Madison.  The barbecue chicken bacon pizza is God's gift to all who inhabit this great earth of ours."}
{"text":"This is an atypical review for Pizza di Roma as I'm basing my review on my carryout experience rather than the usual eat-by-the-slice experience of most of Pizza di Roma's customers.    I recently ordered a 20 inch La Caprese Speciale (fresh mozzarella, tomato, basil, red onions & green olives).   Far such a large pizza, the crust held up extremely well.  While not as tasty as the top echelon of Madison's pizza royalty (Grampa's and Salvatore's), I found it tender, light, and flavorful.    The copious amount of toppings overwhelmed the sauce component - it was very difficult to taste the sauce under a heap of tomatoes and fresh mozzarella.    While I give Pizza di Roma high marks for topping quantity, quality was more of a mixed bag.  For early April, the fresh basil was outstanding.  The red onions were fresh and did not have any bitterness.  The fresh mozzarella was just OK as were the green olives.    Then there were the fresh tomatoes.  Granted, you're not going to get high quality tomatoes in Wisconsin this time of year, so the fact they lacked flavor and had a chewy texture was not surprise.  The other problem was the size of the tomato cuts.  I know they were trying to replicate the feel of a caprese salad, but the whole slices of tomato made the pizza difficult to eat as the tomatoes kept sliding off the pizza.  Another problem with the tomatoes was they gave off a LOT of moisture, creating an extremely soggy pizza after 30 minutes.  In the summer, this would be a much better option when the tomatoes are ripe and fresh, as long as they drain off the excess moisture."}
{"text":"Like Ians, I just don't get this place. The service at times is surly and confusing.  The pizza is extremely cheap and quite good. They have a wide selection of after-bar fried foods.  Otherwise there isn't anything very exciting about Pizza Di Roma."}
{"text":"Very disappointed the Pizza has a very bland taste for nyc Pizza. Im from the Bronx and the only places that tasted like this were the rat hole places. The owner or manager whoever he is that sounds foreign is a real mean guy to customers that is not okay. I remember this place opening a little after casa bianca closed on basset st. This must of been the replacement... Bring casa bs back!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, HUGE slices and since its in the middle of State St, it's close to YOU!  The BBQ pizza is my favorite."}
{"text":"The closest thing to real pizza in Madison, and so far the best I have had in Madison.  Ian's is a close second, but PDR has better sauce.  Pizza Bruta is good, but more like flat bread with stuff on it."}
{"text":"This is pretty much the quintessential 4 star pizza place. Delivery was lightning fast for our online order, the order was correct, and the portion sizes were generous for what we paid. Online ordering system was slick, and had options to personalize your order. Food was decent, not spectacular. French fries, interestingly, were very good. Pizza sauce was a little on the non-flavorful side. Other places tend to have more spice to it, and I think my old man taste buds appreciate more flavor. However, when I added the banana peppers and olives from our salad to the pizza and cheese bread, it was great. Maybe I just needed a supreme. Overall, though, a 4 star experience, and there was something for everyone in our very fickle family to enjoy."}
{"text":"The calzone didn't have ricotta and was just kind of blah. That was disappointment #1. I ordered the extra marinara sauces with the meal (and paid for them) and instead received bleu cheese dressing and no marinara. Right. Cause I'm a eat my calzone with bleu cheese dressing. Disappointment #2. I was refunded for the marinara, but I ordered extra because I like a lot, and eating the calzone dry just kind of ruined the experience. The Caesar salad was good."}
{"text":"Solid pizza and huge slices, 1 is a fair snack and I don't think you would ever need more than two."}
{"text":"My absolute FAVORITE pizza place in Madison. You've gotta love a giant New York style slice that's super affordable and always delicious. Their staff is fantastic and the service is fast.  We order delivery from here often, and it's almost always really quickly - relatively speaking since ordering pizza in Madison is always at least a 45 minute wait.  They also have much more than just pizza on the menu. Also, it's always fun to go in and eat inside the restaurant which I NEVER do at Ian's. It reminds me of New York so much and you really can't beat the price.  I love Pizza Di Roma!"}
{"text":"Best caprese pizza in madison hands down!  Fresh ingredients, straight Italian. Open late too!"}
{"text":"Ordered food for delivery and with an estimated delivery time of 30-45 minutes, received cold almost an hour and a half later on a Wednesday night.  Called to figure out the status of my order and was rudely spoken down to by an on-staff Manager"}
{"text":"Went here and got two specialty slices: chicken parm and caprese. The chicken parm was mostly flavorless and the caprese was completely flavorless. It seriously tasted like water. Ended up being the biggest waste of calories I think I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a quick bite.  Huge mistake.  Got a $4 slice of pepperoni and mushroom--I would have much rather had a slice of Tombstone pizza. Absolutely flavorless--it's a good thing I was in a hurry and eating fast because it was not worth tasting anyway."}
{"text":"Pizza Di Roma is easily the best New York Style pizza I have had in Madison.  It actually makes my list of favorite pizza places.  To qualify myself I am somewhat of a pizza snob and fanatic.  I grew up in eastern PA around a lot of quality pizza shops.  I have had my share of good pizza in NYC, New Jersey and Philadelphia too.   I pretty much only eat pepperoni.  Anywhere I go that is it.  I can not weigh in on specialty pizza at all, which I here is Ian's cup of tea.  For your standard NYC style pizza this has to be the place."}
{"text":"I'd like to begin by saying that the food was pretty good. The delivery driver was offensive and challenged. Unable to do his job, he called three times because he didn't have a navigation unit, sense of direction or clue where East Johnson St. was.  Apparently his phone was stolen so he didn't have navigation, and he thought I should sympathize for his loss. His poor attitude was the worst part.   My calzone dripped with grease, but I wasn't going for \"healthy\" on football Sunday. The tiramisu was a bit dry, but was still tasty.  I'm not sure I can try the place again."}
{"text":"I went here for a late-night slice a few months back.  The pizza wasn't anything special, but I was extremely revolted to see a live roach on my way out.  I will not return."}
{"text":"Why is Madison so obsessed with charging specialty pizza prices for low quality, post-bar munchies?  PDR definitely scratches the hunger itch after a night on State Street, but it's quite frustrating to pay $4-5 a slice for pizza that's typically $1-2 in most college towns.  Do not go for lunch; this is not that kind of pizza place."}
{"text":"Maybe the decision to order in a gyro from a pizza restaurant wasn't my finest decision ever. But it was okay. I missed lettuce in the pita, of course. The two hunks of tomato and three random shards of onion just didn't cut it for me. The fries (which I didn't know were included) were a nice surprise, but they needed a scosh longer in the fryer, to get rid of that pale limber quality that's so disappointing in a fry. Then again: it's a pizza restaurant. On the plus side, my order arrived much faster than the estimate... and the delivery guy was real cute and smiley and courteous (extra star for that). In any case, while I wasn't all-that pleased with my food, I still ate it ... and I think I *might* try their pizza, one day. It's a pizza restaurant, after all."}
{"text":"Say what you want about Ian's--I'm going to Di Roma every time.  This is probably my favorite pizza in the Madison area, next to Salvatore's in Sun Prairie.  I don't live anywhere near it, but I will make special trips just to get it.  It's solid, New York style floppy slice pizza and I would eat an infinite amount of it, were that logistically possible."}
{"text":"I'm surprising myself with this 4 star review. As a devout Ian's supporter, I normally cast PDR aside in favor of a slice from down the street. Lately, however, I've been frequenting Pizza Di Roma almost as equally as Ian's.   It's fresh, the portions are even bigger than Ian's massive slices, and the pizza is gooooood.  I was shocked by the finding that the mac'n'cheese slice from PDR is just as good, if not better than Ian's variation. Served piping hot, swimming in creamy cheese sauce, and al dente mac, this slice is too good to be true.   What makes me love Pizza Di Roma so much is the fact that they're always offering up generous deals on the Hooked app for discounted food. From buy one slice get one free to half off pizza, PDR certainly caters to their college kid clientele.   When the lines get excessive over at Ian's, know that you have an option that is just as delicious right down the street."}
{"text":"It is a good alternative to Ian's at bar time if Ian's is too packed.  Their pizza is probably almost (or just) as good as Ian's but is a less popular spot.  They have unique varieties of pizza as well offered by the slice.  I liked their goat cheese pizza - different and delicious."}
{"text":"I'm from Philly, and this place is a darn good imitation of New York pizza. You cannot get a slice this good in Chicago, anywhere. And that says a lot. Atmosphere and amenities no worse than a Brooklyn pizza stand."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in Madison. I live on the west side and will routinely drive all the way down to state street just to pick up a pie here for carry out . Yes, the restaurant isn't spotless and could use a remodel, but the classic New York style pizza (big, floppy slices) makes up for it.  I almost always order carry out so I don't have to worry about getting an old slice that's been sitting out forever, but the slices taste reasonably good even when they're re-oven'ed. Never had a major problem even microwaving a slice for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"For what Pizza Di Roma is, it's perfect.   If you're looking for a nice place to sit and have a nice quiet dinner, this is probably not your jam. But, if you're looking for some quick DELICIOUS pizza by the slice, to take on your way or to sit down with, then this is the right spot.   The inside is nothing special. Large murals cover one side of the restaurant, and a wall of mirros covers the other. The murals are nice to look at. The rows of booth style seating are older and outdated, but why fix what isn't broken?   There is always a nice selection of pizza available. Anyone would be able to find something they like. Spinach and feta is probably my favorite offering of theirs and it's almost away available when I stop in.   They do offer other menu items such as sandwiches and pastas. I've personally always just gone for the giant slices of pizza.   It's a similar set up to Ian's, but much less to-do and a lot more calm. Usually a much shorter line, too!   I've been coming to Pizza Di Roma since I was a kid. It's one of my State Street faves and I couldn't say a bad word about it. Love it!"}
