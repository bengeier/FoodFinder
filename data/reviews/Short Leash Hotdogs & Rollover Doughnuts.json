{"text":"Short leash is the best! I love the igby and the lady. I have been going to the food truck for years. Brad and Kat grew an amazing business. I was not very excited when I heard their would be a restaurant because I kind of like having to track down the truck and find them when I have a craving but the restaurant is amazing. I really love the new additions. The pig in a blanket and poka dot mac and cheese is amazing. I also really enjoyed the fried green tomato stack. 

I don't understand the lukewarm reviews at all. The flat bread they use is amazing, I love that they have many hot dog options (and the veggie dog is amazing), as for the hipster vibe...well it is downtown but I am the farthest from hipster and have never been shunned so maybe something was going on or it was a fluke. I can't imagine anything like that ever happening. In fact, I am someone who gets forgotten. I am shy and I don't tend to talk to people I don't know yet Brad remembered my name, my order, and never stops being polite and accommodating. 

Back to the food though. If you have not tried short leash you really need to! I don't even like hotdogs but I crave their hotdogs like nothing else. Also, they use local venders for pretty much everything and support our community better than any other business I have seen. It's really refreshing to see."}
{"text":"Good food, good drink, good people. We have followed these guys from the days when Sit...Stay was behind Stinkweeds at Central and Camelback. They work hard to bring the best to your table. Schreiner's Fine Sausages. Local Brew and Spirits. Now with Donuts. If they had a room in the back, I would move in. Try everything, especially stuff you think does not work. Start with the Bear - dog or doughnut, then Fried Green Tomato Stack, and add on a Beer Float. Your tastebuds will mouth kiss you for coming here.

It WILL be yummy. And may enhance your date night."}
{"text":"Best Hot Dogs in Arizona, great beer on tap, and an assortment of good eats. Definitely a new addiction!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today with my boyfriend as I read some great reviews online and saw that they had a neat bloody mary beer fusion online. I was excited to try it out however, the whole experience left me pretty underwhelmed.

The restaurant's atmosphere is really great. A lot of seating both indoor and out as well as a small bar area. We sat outside by choice which was lovely. It took a little while to get rolling with the waitress as she really took her time to take our order/bring it out. The bloody mary/beer fusion that I was amped to try was not on the menu (even though it is online) so I ordered their regular bloody mary which was overwhelmingly spicy and had no traces of alcohol. All the beer which my boyfriend inquired about was also not available.

The food itself was tasty but with the tiniest portions. I ordered a hot dog with a tiny side salad for $8.50! The salad itself I finished in about three or so bites and the hot dog was so small inside a huge naan outter layer and toppings. I was hoping for that amount of $$ I would be getting larger portions. The particular hotdog I ordered was the \"Lady\" and was covered in way too much cream cheese with fried pickles which were cold with all of the outter layering having fallen off. The donuts my boyfriend got ($2.25 a pc!) Were also tiny. 

Overall if your looking for small portions at cost and spotty service go here. Otherwise, I think there are better places to go in that area."}
{"text":"Best Hot Dog I have had in Phoenix. I like to think of myself as a Hot Dog Connoisseur and I would give this place a perfect score. We had the food truck version and the service and food was great. We will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Good and bad experience here.
We arrived at 8pm ordered a pretzel dog to split and several donuts. It was about 45 minutes later that we received our food, and it was lukewarm. Being that we were starving we ate it. I can tell they use good quality products, but it was only a mediocre hot dog. Maybe if it would have been piping hot it would have been a better experience. Their chips, again lukewarm, were greasy, like maybe their oil was too cold. I feel like when there are only 5 other people in the restaurant they could have had our food hot and fresh for that wait.

The redeeming factor was the donuts. Tried the maple bacon and the spicy thai. The maple bacon was very good, but the spicy thai was excellent. Probably the best donut I have ever eaten. So for their donuts I give them a good rating. I will come back and give them another try with their dogs, but for sure will be back for those donuts."}
{"text":"it's a hot dog place. it's along a very cool stretch of Roosevelt. been here a few times. each time, the service has been great, the food was great (i like the Chi town dogger), the cleanliness was solid. parking seems difficult but there is a small lot and plenty of surrounding meters. very accessible location with friendly faces staffing the place.

hot dog lovers be prepared...all dogs are served on a pita bread-like bun. i myself prefer the USA Major League Baseball bunny buns that are more the norm. even so, the flavors at Short Leash compensate for the different kinda \"bun\".

prices are not too high considering Short Leash is near downtown/ASU/Roosevelt...smart move to keep things pretty affordable. smart move to staff your restaurant with employees who care and take care. good spot."}
{"text":"Cute place. Friendly staff. But in the end, it's $8/$9 for a mediocre hotdog. The cool packaging and hip feel definitely don't make up for the food.  Our family ordered five different things off the menu, and none of us are interested in going back."}
{"text":"Food is over priced and very bad. Poutine fries (10.00) chili dog (8.00) and ice tea (2.50). The fries had tasteless gravy and 8 quarter inch squares of cheese. I don't think they were cheese curds as stated in menu. The chili dog was so dry I didn't eat but 2 bites (horrible). I will not recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"Intimidating to try their unique menu. I had a \"hotdog\", bratwurst with chipotle cream cheese, saut√©ed onions, and fried pickles which was actually one of the most  normal things on the menu. It was surprisingly delicious. Great place to go if your bored of the same routine and menus everywhere. Great service and atmosphere. Definitely try if you are in the mood to be adventurist."}
{"text":"So happy this food truck establishment now has a brick and mortar restaurant. Grabbed lunch here and will soon be back. This visit I tried to have something I hadn't tried yet so we got the corn dog bites, the oliver and hubby got the moki (which looked great, but too messy to share- or he just liked it too much). I really liked mine and the jalapeno cheese stuffed corn dog bites were my favorite. I almost wish that the app only included these and not the plain hot dog filled bites. Luckily for me I think they know this and I think only 2 out of the 6 were the regular bites. We didn't have a beer this time and I spent quite a bit of time regretting my decision because they had such a stellar selection. Great local and not so local craft beers are available. Must drink next time! Also- I miss the fried pickles and the lady hot dog I tried on a prior taste at the truck, so I will have to visit more often to work my way through the menu! Aw, shucks."}
{"text":"Sucked...food lacks portion. I ordered a goat cheese salad entree and it was appetizer size, hot dogs are poor quality, they don't over a choice of bun or puta bread, water glasses had lip stick on the rim.

Service was very poor...I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday around noon. There were not a whole lot people here but the service was still slow. I ordered a Miko style to go and it took a long time to wait for the waitress and get my food. But, the hot dog was a BOMB. I loved it wrapped in a pita bread. Next time I will try the naked style to see if its tasty as the same."}
{"text":"What a nice little surprise in Downtown Phoenix! I stopped here on a whim for lunch, and didn't even check Yelp 1st! I know, quite unusual from me, so yes, I was a little nervous! haha
Small place with a full bar and huge beer list! Whats the story here? Gourmet-Simple Sausages! They have 3 types of Sausage(Beef Brat, Hot Beer Sausage, Chicken Sausage) served on a piece of Naan(Indian flatbread) They offer about 10 of their own creations as far as topping combos, but they also have a Build Your Own option with probably 25 different toppings to choose from. 
I decided to go for their Special of the Day(Week maybe) which was Bleu Cheese, Bacon, Arugula. And chose the Hot Beer Sausage. It was delicious! Great flavor from the bacon and sausage, and the bleu cheese just brought it all together. 
They also have another specialty here, Insane Donuts with a kiss of artistic flair! 
I was so tempted by the dessert menu that I went for an Apple Fritter with caramel! It didn't disappoint at all! 
While I was leaving, I noticed they also have a Food Truck! Actually, 2! One looked to be Donuts only and the other was much larger and seemed to be their Mobile Sausage Delivery Unit for the hungry people of Phoenix! 
Check this place out if you want a modern twist on the age old Cased Meat!"}
{"text":"Happened to walk by while down in the art district over the weekend because this place caught my eye, and I say they had Chicago dog ok the menu, me being from Chicago figured, sure why not. First let me say, these are no way even close to what a Chicago dog is. I'm not sure if anyone here actually has had a real Chicago hotdog, because what they are serving certainly isn't it. Almost $20 for my \"Chicago dog\" and the dog my date got. As another review has written on here, I can't think of anywhere in Chicago that charges that for 2 hotdogs. The only reason they are even getting 2 stars is because the pita bread was great, maybe they can start making gyros, and the beef hotdog was good. Besides that, unless you want to be overcharged for hipster style, so called hotdogs, just keep walking and save your money"}
{"text":"You charged me $8.50 for my already $6.00 hot dog, it was really good but I don't have an extra $2.50 just laying around for hot dogs.  Please charge what your menu says."}
{"text":"We stopped at Short Leash Hot Dogs on Roosevelt in Phoenix while on an extended road trip. We're so glad we did! One of the owners, Brad, and the rest of the staff made us so welcome, explaining the menu and telling us about this place. We got our hot dogs on naan, a super idea! There are lots of choices and you can customize your selection. You really should try this place!"}
{"text":"I am so happy this place opened up, now I no longer have to chase the food truck around town or stand in a long line, I get to sit down and enjoy this local legend on the regular. When I first discovered short leash I was a vegetarian. I only went a few times to have the veggie dog Moki style with sriacha (very good). I think I might have even cheated once and eaten a chicken dog. Things have changed and now I have to say that I am enjoying even more. It was hard I stray from the Moki because it was very yummy, but I've tried the Igby, Oliver and the Lady with either a beer hot or polish. All of which are fabulous. To my surprise, the Lady on a beer hot is my favorite (I was scared off by fried pickles at first). What I also love about this brand is how real, authentic and grounded the team is. Brad and Kat are so genuine and they've attracted a motley crew. I wish I could eat here every day."}
{"text":"I hosted my book club there last night because the book was about a dog and I wanted to keep with the theme. Everyone was so friendly and accommodating! Our group had everything from the Bear dogs, Pretzel dogs, Polish dogs, fries, and mac and cheese. They tasted a variety of the beers as well.
It was all delicious and the whole group raved about the food, atmosphere, and the staff! Because it was a book club we stayed there longer than a typical dinner and everyone was so gracious and kind about the length of our stay. At the end of the evening we even had the opportunity to taste their donuts and they were delicious too! I appreciate the hospitality and wholeheartedly recommend the short leash!"}
{"text":"Every time I have come to short leash there is either an issue with the way the food is made or customer service. One time they messed up the order so bad that they offered me a voucher for the next time. I thought this would be a great experience for a family with vegetarians and meat eaters alike. I honestly don't know why I get talked into coming here. The concept is great but the employees are not always on the top of their customer service experience. Smile, offer over the top service and even through mistakes I could work with that."}
{"text":"If you're downtown and hungry there may be plenty of places you can go, but none will be as satisfying, as fresh, or as dedicated to the art of delicious as Short Leash. 

Fried pickles are a must. Their salads are fresh and the entr√©es are inventive creations that leave you with a full stomach and a stupid grin.

Short Leash's Signature dogs feature meats from Phoenix's historic butcher Schreiner's Fine Sausages. The meat is grilled along with innovative and daring ingredients and then cradled in a warm naan flatbread. 

By marrying fresh local ingredients with savory hot dog flavor, Short Leash has created a refreshing, fulfilling and truly transcendental hot dog eating experience. I would eat here daily if I could and I recommend it to all who enjoy life."}
{"text":"Really good, quality hot dogs. However, very pricey for a small-ish meal. Also, not a ton of seating, which is kind of a downer. I would go back for a casual meal when I'm downtown."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is always great and the service is always friendly though it can be slow at sometimes. The beer selection is a little limited for its location in downtown, but that's never been a negative for me because the food is outstanding."}
{"text":"I think heaven might just be short leash hot dogs. 
They have been touched by the gods, they have been blessed by the angels.  
Try a hot dog, any hot dog.  You won't be disappointed.  You can't go wrong.  

It's just...perfection.  

That's about all there is to say.

Sure, sometimes there's a wait.  Sometimes it's crowded.  Sure.  All those things.  But can you put a wait time on excellence?  Can you complain about something that will change you fundamentally as a human being?  Can you really be upset about something that will show you what we're truly here on earth to experience?

...I might be SLIGHTLY exaggerating here.  But believe me, not by much.  If you love hot dogs (and how can you NOT?!), you simply HAVE to eat here.  There is no other option.  Eat. HERE."}
{"text":"Just had a Chicago style bratwurst. Excellent! They use  nan instead of buns and it works perfectly. You won't have mustard on your tie. 

The fries were enjoyable. 

Service was excellent.  Everything was!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Friday at 9:30. I am not the biggest hot dog fan of all time, but wanted to try it after reading the reviews. I'm a plain kind of girl, so I got the build your own with regular hot dog, cheddar, raw onion, ketchup and mustard. Now, this may seem plain and boring to you, but to me, it was the best hot dog I've ever had!! I think the naan bread puts it over the top. The chips were quite delicious, too. I got a ballast point pale ale that was very good with the hot dog. The person I was with got the goat cheese salad and said it was very good. Our waitress was great and attentive. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I had no idea a hot dog could be so ridiculously delightful. The bear is outrageous - In a good way. I personally love the mango chutney topping and the spicy dog. It is a true local success story and uses all local ingredients. Great beer selection too."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me knows that I love going to Short Leash. The food is incredible and creative. The owners are genuinely nice people. The new dessert donuts are amazing as my husband gets one each time."}
{"text":"This place is great! I love hot dogs and I really liked that this place serves them a little different than I have had before. The icing on the cake for me was the strawberry cheesecake doughnut that they recently started making. WOW.... make sure you save room for that."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have great vegetarian dogs, and the waiters/esses are friendly and helpful, and they bring you some great food... What's not to love?
The hand cut chips are one of my favorite things, but then so is
The devil dog, the sunny, fried green tomatoes salad...
I've seriously never had anything here I didn't like!
Oh and the specials are pretty cool too! 
Thanks for being a great neighborhood restaurant!"}
{"text":"Brad is a complete idiot. Went here one time and will never return. Very unprofessional. I hope this restaurant and his others all go bankrupt. Nasty food, terrible service, and poorly ran. Good job Brad.. Keep doing what your doing."}
{"text":"All I can say is yum. They catered our job on food truck day and their Chicago 
 hot dog on a pita was delicious. Plus they serve coke in a glasses bottle and poore brother chips!  What could be better? Staff was also very nice and fast!"}
{"text":"While I would have given the bratwurst 4 stars, this place gets 5 stars for the overall experience. It's a cool little spot, the staff was incredibly friendly, they have a few good local IPAs for reasonable prices, and it's connected to the upcoming storefront of Mamma Toledo's pie truck. All in all, it's the type of place you feel good about supporting.

As far as the brat, I went with the Moki (roasted green chilis, pinto beans, tomatoes, cheddar, etc.). The brat and the toppings individually were solid, but I wasn't sure about the combo, which was my fault. I might go for one of their signatures next time, which eliminates the selection of the meat. Comes with a side of greens or chips; the greens were a tasty way to break the whole thing up. Afterward, they offer a few types of pie from Mamma Toledo's, or you can just walk over to the pie display (connected inside the restaurant) and pick from any of them. $4 for a slice is definitely worth it.

You should go here."}
{"text":"Tried this place twice. Hot dogs = good. Little pricy but gourmet hot dogs so I guess thats okay.
Chips = both times tasted like burnt potatoes. Service is great."}
{"text":"This food truck hasn't quite figured out how to be a restaurant. The food was ok, but the service was crap. We got there and half of their tables weren't bussed. The waitress took our order, only took half the drink orders and we never saw her again. Our appetizer  never showed up and when we asked they said it would take 20 minutes because they were chaining their oil... in the middle of dinner service? 

The food was good, a dog on its own won't fill you up, and it's was not worth the wait and bad service. Huge bummer because I was really excited for this restaurant and probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Awesome surprise to stop into when wandering around Phoenix as tourists. We wished we were hungrier so we could keep eating. Cute atmosphere, awesome beer, creative fare, delicious food."}
{"text":"It's a shame that the hot dogs and donuts are grouped into the same listing because I haven't tried their hot dogs... but based on the donuts, I might not.
First, the cost - I think it was $12 for SIX donuts (and that was after getting a \"discount\" for buying 6).
Second, the donuts - all of them. Awful. The \"apple fritter\" - and I keep using quotes because they just can't be serious - tasted like a stale Circle K discard. And it was super tiny. Also had the pistachio, chocolate cinnamon, maple bacon, Thai coconut and black and blue... 
Which reminds me. The black and blue was actually good. Not amazing. But original, and pretty good. That donut, along with the super sweet but ultimately misguided about what constitutes a \"good donut\" cashier alllllmost earned the place a second star, but the abysmal failure of the only two things that truly matter - value and quality - keep this joint in one-star territory."}
{"text":"Best gourmet hotdogs, fried pickles. I will come back again and again to taste the whole menu"}
{"text":"The negative complaints about this place are all about the prices here. The food is awesome. Fried pickles are some of the best I've ever had. Support your local restaurants and pay the extra buck or two. It's going to be better than chilli's. I promise."}
{"text":"Great hot dogs. I love the way they come up with new ideas on old classics. It all started with the food truck and the restaurant is just that much better. Jon well done!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.. I came here recently to catch up with an old buddy of mine not knowing anything about it.. we sat at the bar that was playing ESPN as I feel it is a must to watch baseball while eating a Dog.. so that was a plus.. but this place is definitley hipster so youre not gonna get sports stuffed down your throat..  it was 2 dollar tuesdays for IPAs and other beers from many local and national breweries.. fuck yeah!! After killin 5 of the Camelback IPAs I tried the mini corn dog bites that were oh so good and fried to perfection.. they come out on these giant sticks and have the most amazing fresh golden batter.. this place is no bullshit people.. its a giant purple building so you cant miss it.. also say Hi to the bartender/server chic Mary Lynn as she was a pleasure to chit chat with and made us feel like we were best friends!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times the staff and management shit the bed.

First time I came, they didn't have enough competent wait staff to handle the patio at half capacity. When I went inside to grab a brew, the staff informed me that I had to stay with my group and order outside. I asked to just order one beer. Denied. Screw you, I'm not spending money here.

About four months later, I came for killer prices on craft cans and $2 off appetizers. Seems like the place is trying to make amends, right? So, they decided to make the place counter service only, and you have to wait in line (the kitchen opens directly into the line which is annoying). They tell me that the credit card machine is buggy, but I got 40 bones in my pocket. No problem, right? Well, after waiting 15 minutes in line, and hungry for some gourmet corn dog action, I finally learned my lesson about this TERRIBLE business.

Here's why the CAPS. The manager decides that, as my hungry ass gets to the counter, and after having served 20 people in front of me, that her register is broken, and cannot serve me. But, I patiently waited about 10 minutes to see if I can get some dog. And yes, I know it was the manager, because she said \"my employees.\" I even offered solutions. I told her that I have cash. \"Nope. It's broken, can't do anything.\" I asked her to write down my order and I'll pony up when you get the register fixed. \"Nope, can't do anything.\" What, you don't have the tech to WRITE my order and charge me later?  Even though you served 20 people in front of me? Nope, \"I know this is frustrating for you.\"

Ok, lady. Like the 40 people behind me in line who left already, I'm not \"frustrated;\" I'm annoyed. My $40 will be spent on food somewhere. I don't give a crap where. I'm a seasoned professional, and you're a foolhardy and patronizing manager of a glorified hot dog stand. I'll get food. You won't get my money. You're too dense to write down orders IN A RESTAURANT. Not my problem. That's not \"frustrating\" to me. 

TL;DR:  the staff is arrogant and idiotic. Apparently they don't like making money. The owner should fire everyone, but apparently doesn't read reviews."}
{"text":"The hot dogs are definitely not for everyone. They're served on naan (which I didn't know by reading the menu, but which I liked), and there are strange toppings. And there was an exorbitant amount of these toppings, so my brat (which itself was good) was drowning in sauerkraut and dressing, making it more goopy than anything. The service was also slow; we were the only ones in the restaurant and we waited a very long time for our check.

On the plus side, the decor and theme are outstanding, and each table had a deck of Uno cards, which was great for passing the time."}
{"text":"It was good. Or hot dogs were great! Our apps weren't. I would just go for hot dogs and drinks. Staff was very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"On of my favorite Central Phoenix spots.  Great bear on tap and the menu is fantastic.  The staff is great."}
{"text":"Friday night, not enough food left at home to feed 3. It's Friday! We all wanted something different, delicious (healthy is optional). Yelp to the rescue.

THE PLACE: It's right in downtown Phoenix; SE corner of 1st Street and Roosevelt. I've lived in the Greater Phoenix area for over 10 years, but I can't say I'm familiar with the history of the area. The vibe to me, up and coming, beatnik. Lots of graffiti on the surrounding walls by the parking lot that it shares with other small establishments. Not vandal type but the good kind of graffiti. More artsy if you will. The restaurant is not really big, but it has ample seating inside and plenty of outdoor seating.  The decor is very casual, with an industrial feel to it. Best part, right by the unisex restrooms is a wall of photos of dogs -- the barking kind. With endearing notes of who their loving mommies and daddies are.  Quite cool.  Oh, and before you take the correct turn to the restrooms, make the mistake of turning left and not regret it -- takes you to Mamma Toledo's Pies.

THE SERVICE: The server was friendly, helpful and happy to help with recommendations. The service was fast and efficient.

THE FOOD: I would recommend the Fried Pickles. Not a big fan of pickles? Don't knock it until you try it. Pickles tasted like they were a mix of sweet and dill dipped in delicious batter. Comes with 2 dips, ranch and chipotle. My daughter is a not a big fan of pickles, but you couldn't tell by watching her eat it. Hubby had the Mac Daddy -- mac n cheese, beef & bean chili, beef wiener. I had the Sunny -- grilled fruit, prosciutto, mixed greens, goat cheese, honey, chicken wiener. My baby girl had an Aiko - mango chutney, mayo and her selected wiener was a polish. What sets the experience a part?  All are served on Naan versus your traditional hotdog bun.  I looked at my plate of food, and thought I could have more than 1 for sure.  Not so much! It was surprisingly filling. I was getting full, but it sure did not stop me from savoring every morsel and making sure none of my Sunny was left behind.

Definitely, coming back -- I want to try the Oliver next :)"}
{"text":"I tried the food truck and loved it.  Today,  I looked forward to trying the \"Sit and Stay Restaurant\" -- they got the \"sit\" portion down pat!   Around 1 p.m. I sat at the bar hoping to order a beer and one of the special dogs.  To their credit, I was quickly handed a menu and glass of water but that was it.  For twenty minutes, the waitresses moved quickly in and out behind the bar filling water or ducking into the kitchen.  I tried to get their attention and was ignored. I left.

Extremely disappointed because the people in the truck were cool, quick and helpful. I won't be back to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Fun place. Great dogs! Fried pickles, where have you been all my life? Also, an adorable Rollover Donuts mini counter on-site! Winning!"}
{"text":"My partner and I ordered from Postmates. I had the \"Monnika Style\" which is described as \"two bacon wrapped crispy dogs served with dragon sauce.\"
You guys.... This reminded me of the hot dogs you get at Circle K. It was a greasy hot dog filled with some kind of gross cheese sauce wrapped in a TORTILLA AND FRIED THEN WRAPPED IN BACON. This \"meal\" was the epitome of the dark side of American food.

With all of the awesome restaurants in Phoenix, save your time and money and skip this place."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times and I have discovered this.
This place decided to reinvent the wheel.
Something as simple as a hotdog, and then you flip it on its ear. At first glance some of the combinations seem intimidating, but you could not be more wrong. Today I had the food I order delivered by a food delivery company and it was worth the extra $5, even if the food had been cold it would still have been amazing.
 Last thing I will say and please listen close.
Fried pickles!!"}
{"text":"Awesomeness! Chili cheese dog was divine. Their pickles are splendid. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff.  Will visit again!"}
{"text":"I will start with, if today was my first day ever eating here, I wouldn't come back.  I started coming to short leash almost a year ago and fell in love with The Bear, so much so that I always get it.  The way the crumbled cracker jacks meshed with the Gouda and the PB with the BBQ sauce with just enough bacon to sit up and say hello.  Something recently has begun to change.  It started with the Cracker jacks being not so finely ground and even som left whole which detracted from the flavor.  Then, they stopped even attempting to crumble then and just dropped whole ones on so that a when you take a bite you either get the flavor of The Bear or just a mash of either BBQ or PB depending on which was slathered on more that day.  The proportions were so different on some days that I couldn't finish it.  When you order a food based on playing off unique flavors, make sure all the flavors are always there or you muck up the experience.  Today, the dog was entirely bacon, not kidding, so much bacon that I felt like I was eating a bacon dog.  I love bacon, but I didn't want a bacon dog, I wanted that lovely mash of flavors that makes me smile.  This was trash.  With the ever changing formula of this flavorful dog continuously changing for the negative and a waitress that simply smiled when I voiced my concern I will have second thoughts before coming back.  
I miss you The Bear, I hope we can meet again one day, but today was not that day."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great. Great beer selection. Great hot dogs. Awesome apps. Great service. Karn is always on point."}
{"text":"I've been there four times in the past week and I want to go back tomorrow. This place is amazing and I'm only upset that I haven't gone here before! The hotdogs are bomb and Jill is the sweetest! Definitely one of my favorite places in all of Phoenix. 
P.S. Get the Bear, with the hot sausage (if you aren't a vegetarian of course). It might sound weird but I promise it will be the best thing."}
{"text":"No!

Not just no, but hell no!

Pure garbage food, misses on all cylinders. The brat in a pretzel roll \"entree\" is the equivalent of a boiled hot dog in a Fry's grocery store pretzel roll.

I guess the real irony is that I wouldn't feed this crap to my dog (and he wouldn't eat it).

Way more focus on being \"hip\" than quality food."}
{"text":"Save your money and go to costco!
We had the Braut pretzel dog, overloaded with sauerkraut, enough for three dogs. Don't get the salad, no dressing, don't get the coleslaw, also no dressing. Just don't go!   Also the fried pickles were burnt, burnt like you hate your job burnt."}
{"text":"Ok. Lets get the lone slight negative out of the way; more dressing on the slaw is preferred by yours truly. That said, great selection and diverse choices on the dogs. Love the flat bread. Outstanding choices of beverages. Knowledgeable staff. Will definately come again."}
{"text":"Love this place! What a cute little laid back spot to have lunch on a Sunday afternoon. My family and I really enjoyed ourselves. I really like how they serve water out of the glass bottles. The fried pickles were delicious as well as the hot dogs. Very fresh food. The prices are a little high but worth every penny."}
{"text":"After experiencing the legend that is the Short Leash Dogs food truck, I was excited to try the Sit...Stay Restaurant.  The same popular dogs are available, but the expanded menu is just as good!  On the most recent visit, I had the Fried Green Tomato stack.  As you might guess, it is a stack of fried green tomatoes, with avocados in between each tomato layer and sitting upon a salad of greens, corn, bacon, and possibly some kind of nut.  The whole thing is drizzled with a mayo based dressing.  OH my gosh it was good.  I washed it down with an ice cold coke from a bottle, and supplemented with a couple bites sneaked from my husband's Bear dog on naan.

The atmosphere is active and busy, and a little hipster.  Everyone is super friendly and laid back.  Apparently there's pie next door?  We'll have to try that next time!"}
{"text":"\"How will Short Leash be able to translate all the good things about their food truck into a sit down restaurant?\" was my only question when I ventured over to Roosevelt Row last week. Imagine my surprise when I had all of my expectations topped. 

Upon entering their new establishment, my mom and I were greeted by a host. Totally unexpected. In fact, I walked right past the stand and in to the dining area. A bit embarrassing! Oh well!

We were promptly seated at a community style table we shared with another family. The furnishings were all clean, modern, and not fussy. We loved the geometric wallpaper on the north wall. Very cool. 

Our server was low key and likeable, and showed us around the menu I know so well from patronizing the truck for several years now. My mom was less familiar, and he helped her build her order patiently. 

We were served our food with cloth napkins, glassware for our beverages, and metal silverware. This all made for a great dining experience. 

The food was delicious as always, and they still offer a wide selection of bottled sodas to pick from. We didn't order desert, but the selections from the Pie Hole looked and sounded tasty too. 

As I said, my expectations were definitely exceeded! What a great business this is. I enjoy the owners and the company they are building. The care and deliberation they are showing is very apparent."}
{"text":"Great service. Great bar. Mary Lynn is awesome! So great. It is chill, good vibes! Such good vibes! Weiners are chicken, pork, beef, or vegan. Go now!"}
{"text":"We really liked this place a lot. We were introduced to it via the culinary food event  Devoured.  Short Leash Dogs stood out amongst incredible contenders. So, that inspired the 22+ mile trip for a hot dog. 
We started with the fried pickles. They were good and unique but I was satisfied after two or three and there was a big basket for 6$. I ordered the Oliver with a spicy beer hot dog. When I picked it up, water literally ran out of it for lets say 20 seconds. Too late, my naan was now soggy. Clearly no one even attempted to drain the sauerkraut. The taste was there  and the salad was exceptional.
Partner had the Moki. That was divinity wrapped up in a naan. What a crazy good combo of deliciousness on a spicy dog. We would definitely order this puppy again....with a salad. The chips were boring.
So we drove 22+ miles, spent $42 on hot dogs (with two delicious tap beers and tip) and will do it again. The restaurant is darling and funky!"}
{"text":"Great food and drink selection. Very cool atmosphere and love playing Uno there.  
The pretzel dog and the one with green chilies were amazing.  If you like fried pickles, try them.  They are sweater than ones you probably have had in the past due to the Frosted Flake coating."}
{"text":"I love the food. I love the decor.

I don't love the careless employees who let us wait for almost an hour for our to-go food.  Cold food, cold fries, cold hearted.

Guess I'll stick to the food truck, lest I spend another entire lunch hour waiting on food that is ready behind a counter."}
{"text":"Love the food truck and the brick & mortar!"}
{"text":"I must be too old for this place. I wasn't impressed with the loud rock music playing and the service was only so-so. We ordered what the waitress suggested which was fried pickles, the mac daddy & the bratwurst stuffed pretzel. Both dogs were bad and the fried pickles were so sweet they could've been dessert. The small hotdogs were drowned out by the cornucopia of strange ingredients on them."}
{"text":"The staff is great, food is great, beer is great, and you don't break the bank. Downtown needs more places like this."}
{"text":"Very unhappy that shortleash has changed their menu so much. The scotch eggs are no longer available, the scrambled breakfast crispy dog was tossed out awhile ago and the crispy dog that came with 3 dogs now only comes with 2. We used to come here pretty frequently and would bring any family and friends that were visiting phx but we are sad to see the menu diminish and are less likely to come now."}
{"text":"There are very few places where I try a completely new menu item confidentally. Short leash hotdogs is one of those places. I have been here multiple times and every time I am so amazed at what they serve. My girlfriend stays with the Mac Daddy dog, and it's incredible. The last two times i've gone, I've gotten the stuffed sauerkraut pretzel dog, and the pretzel dog, and God damn they are delicious. The staff on hand is always so friendly. The ambience is original and fun. I have nothing bad to say about this place at all. I absolutely love short leash hotdogs!"}
{"text":"This review is for Rollover Doughnuts only--came in looking to try a variety of unique, decadent donuts for breakfast and I was not disappointed! I had my choice of almost a dozen different kinds of fun flavors and came home with a box of different donuts to sample with my husband. We really loved all of them! The service was nice, the prices were alright, but I will say it was a little difficult to pinpoint their exact location (took a little bit longer than normal to find them)."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and definitely a must every time I'm in the area! The food has always been great here and they have a solid beer selection as well. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Sincerely the BEST fried green tomato I have EVER had. This is a must try of a menu of winners."}
{"text":"Loved the menu here - I'm not really a hot dog person and I would be back. Besides just putting together fun and surprising combos of ingredients, the presentation (dogs folded up in naan bread and then tucked into one of those zigzag steel taco stands, salads served as fresh heaps of lovely ingredients, fried pickles scattered about a tray with colorful dipping sauces) has obviously been thought through and lovingly prepared."}
{"text":"Just as good as the truck, if not better.  The restaurant is a little small, but we went on a Friday night and had no problem getting a table.  Food tasted great and has many more options than what is on the truck.  

For an appetizer, we tried both the fried pickles and pimento cheese dip and both were great!  The corn dogs are also amazing!

We love the food truck, but think I will be frequenting the restaurant more due to the convenience.  Friendly service, fun atmosphere and great staff, would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My sister and I stopped by for a quick before dinner snack.

Their menu is extensive with a million topping choices as well as sausage options.

We ordered the bratwurst stuffed pretzel with a spicy beer hot sausage - $9. The sausage came out encased on a what appeared to be a pretzel boat. It was loaded with sauerkraut, onion, bacon and dressed with swiss + sweet bavarian mustard. 

It was a little difficult to eat because it was so enormous, and the sausage to bread ratio was a little off, but other than that, it was good. The spicy beer hot sausage was delicious - hot, and the casing had a nice snap when you bit into it.

My favorite of the night was something call the aiko with a bratwurst - $8. Listed under the signature dog list, it comes enveloped in naan bread and topped with mango chutney + drizzle mayo. This dog made me a naan believer - I don't know what it is with the combination of the bratwurst + naan bread, but it was unlike anything I've ever eaten and it was good.

Short Leash's innovative approach to take an old American favorite into a foray of new flavors won me over. Kudos to them and their sausage game."}
{"text":"I waited for about 10 minutes. The hostess looked right at me and walked away. I know I might not be their normal clientele....I mean I had taken a shower that morning and don't have a beard but geez how rude. If you don't look hipster enough be prepared to be treated like crap."}
{"text":"I walked in 15 minutes before close (which I hate doing), and Evelyn who greeted us treated us like it was the middle of the day! She was so helpful with the menu, extremely kind, and offered us to take as many of their homemade doughnuts to go for free since it was the end of the night. 
I ordered the Lady (fried pickles, a creamy sauce, wrapped in a pita-like tortilla).
My friend ordered the Bear (peanut butter, cracker jax, bacon, and more). 
They were both $14 and AMAZING. 
The only thing I would improve is my own fault--we went towards close and didn't get the full experience. 
I'll definitely be going again. 
The ambiance was great, they had a wide selection of beers, and the food was great!"}
{"text":"Decent selection of donut flavors but wasn't really what I was interested in when I wanted donuts. Taste was really good but texture wasn't like a traditional donut. Coffee was very good."}
{"text":"Here I spent a lot of money. For food that was warm, and for the service, which did not completely obscure my needs. I'm depressed."}
{"text":"First time here and will need to return! Enjoyed a Devils Dog vegetarian hot dog. For a vegetarian dog, it tasted pretty good! I'll have to come back to try an actual hot dog! My only complaint is that I didn't realize just how spicy it would be. I also like that unique twist on the \"bun\", which is actually what looks like naan bread."}
{"text":"Top notch service! Brittany was kind, attentive and knowledgable. So hard to find in downtown phoenix. Bartender was great too. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Lunchtime & Thank my lucky stars I called my order in. I got there & place has a long line to order. There is some awkwardness as the line goes thru the main dining room & I got the stink eye from patrons waiting in line, but as I consider myself a professional at eating out, I knew better than to go the route of ordering when I got there. ANYWAY....my main concern is the food. Our doggies were delicious. I'm not gonna get into mundane details. If you even remotely like hotdogs, try this place."}
{"text":"Last night was the grand opening of Sit....Stay the sit down restaurant for Short Leash Hot Dogs. I have only had Short Leash one time before this at a UYE that Jon H. hosted. From first bite I was in love. So much more than just a regular hot dog. Then I heard that this restaurant was opening, I was super excited.
Had to show up for the first day. So did a lot of other people but that is a good thing. When I got there I muscled my way inside and got my name on the list. I was told the wait would be about an hour and a half. That is understandable. First night. Ton of people. The place is not that big. Nice cozy spot. So many people it took me awhile to realize there was a bar as well as tables. I thought it was just a bunch of people standing in one corner.
The wait was awesome. Best wait for a table at a restaurant I have ever had. The owners were also running around handing out hot dog pops. Little corn dogs on sticks some with Jalapeno cheese in them. It was a surprise as to which ones did. Also the nicest girl was handing out waters and refilling them for those standing around. She had the best attitude, I think, ever for someone filling up water glasses. As busy as it was she was super happy and excited to be refilling water. Plus she was genuinely happy that you had shown up. The owners were very nice too. Everyone was.
So after my awesome time of waiting I finally got called. Felt like I won something. Got seated at a table with several other people in various stages of their meals. Again understandable with so many people. Waiter came over, also very nice, took drink orders. Nice girl with the water showed up again. The menu is changed slightly from the food truck menu. All the regular dogs are there and you can build your own. Plus they have new entrees and salads. You can also order pitchers of beer which is great and they have Kilt Lifter on tap another plus. Had a little trouble picking which dog I wanted. So many great choices. Finally got the Bear. Which has the oddest list of ingredients that you would think would not work at all but it just does. Peanut butter, cracker jacks, smoked Gouda cheese, bacon and BBQ sauce. Crazy right? But soooo good. The fact that all of their dogs are served on naan bread pushes it over the top.
Drinks took awhile coming out. Again no problem. I love the little tin trays they bring the food in. All dogs are served with chips or a garden salad. It was one of the best meals I have had in a long time and the hot dogs were really good too.
This place is awesome. If you go here and just get a plain old mustard and sauerkraut dog you are doing yourself a disservice. Also don't miss out on Mamma Toledo's pie shop. Hidden in the corner. Turn left instead of right when you head towards the bathrooms. They will Shut Your Pie Hole. Didn't try the pies but the cookie bars were really good. If they are any indication the pies should be great.
I had an awesome time. No one else can have as awesome of a time here as I did, it is impossible, but you will get a great hot dog though. The best around. Even if you have to wait for it trust me it is very worth it. There is a reason there is a wait. They are that good. Your mind might just be blown. It is possible.

This place has the possibility of becoming very special for me but that is just me. Only me. I don't want to build it up too much for everyone else."}
{"text":"I LOVE HOT DOGS! 

Hot dogs in a pretzel? Hot dogs in a na'an? What?! Am I in HEAVEN HERE????? 

My favorite place to grab a bite, the food is amazing. You can't ever go wrong with anything on their menu. 

If I could eat here every single day I would. 

The beer selection is great, I love the sides and I am currently working my way down the menu to try every hot dog."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!! I ordered a Crispy Dog and it was fantastic!  I was so excited I forgot to take a picture.  It was 3 juicy dogs with jalapeno & cheese taquito style.  The creamy avocado sauce didn't have much flavor but the cool texture was good with the dogs.  The salad that cons with it was wilted and gross. I didn't eat it. 

My spouse got The Sunny.  This was a new experience for him.  He loved it though.  He said the fruit wasn't sweet, it was more like a chutney.  The goat cheese and Naan is what made this dog.  He liked the salad on the side but did say his was wilted too."}
{"text":"Why 4 stars? Because gourmet hot dogs never get old.

   ---   ---   ---

I feel like the market of gourmet dogs is undersaturated. I never get tired of visiting these types of places. Eating a hot dog is generally associated with good memories from your childhood, from being at the ballpark, or out at the pool on the 4th of July. Why wouldn't one enjoy a good hot dog?? Maybe because no one is really sure what's inside of those Oscar Meyer weiners. If that's the case, I can understand your hesitation.

Enter: gourmet hot dogs. You get all the pleasures of hot dog nostalgia, sans the mystery meat, but with delightful toppings added on. Everybody wins!

My only \"beef\" if you will, is that I've had better gourmet dogs elsewhere. Not in Phoenix, but in my journey across the land. On this particular vacation, I had just come from Denver, where Biker Jim's set the bar incredibly high.

But I'd definitely return to Short Leash again!"}
{"text":"This was such a unique find! Such a diverse menu and even a veggie dog! The veggie dog imitates a meat flavor just a heads up for all the vegetarians who aren't looking for that in a substitute! The dogs are so creative and there are so many options. I got the chili Mac n cheese dog and they all come out on a naan type fry bread! It was so delicious and the fried pickles were to die for!! The atmosphere is great as well with indoor and outside seating!! Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"My dad and I were visiting from CA and wanted something unique for dinner so we came to Short Leash after some investigating on Yelp. It was incredible. I got the Chicago dog with a bratwurst and my dad got the Devil dog with a bratwurst and we both agreed that they were the best hot dogs we've ever had. (And we have had many ballpark dogs to compare them to!) We also shared an order of jalapeno poppers but we were too full to finish. They were the best jalapeno poppers I'd ever had and completely different than the traditional method. Instead of feeling like a deep fried chunk of cream cheese they tasted fresh. They slice a jalapeno in half fill it with smoked gouda and put a light batter on top of the cheese. I don't ever want jalapeno poppers a different way. We also saw a customer order the most glorious cinnamon roll and if we had any room left we would have ordered one to go! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Before going to the Phoenix Art Museum, my boyfriend and I decided to stop by to get some hotdogs! 

We decided to get the bear and the moki. I was a little scared because of the wacky food combos, but decided to be adventurous and give it a try. While waiting, they had uno cards on the table so we played that until the food was ready. The food came out in a cute little tray. It was pretty hefty and boy was it good. I'm not a big fan of bbq sauce but the sauce mixed with peanut butter is pleasantly good. They offer a variety of unique hotdogs thatll explode your tastebuds! I'll definitely be back to try out their donuts

Their doggy wall of fame is also very cute"}
{"text":"This place is one of my ultimate favorite for their fried pickles, and Signature Aiko"}
{"text":"I love this place. New favorite. Good beer, great veggie dogs and a really nice patio."}
{"text":"Had the sunny and loved it!

While it may not be the item to order every time you go if you are in the mood for something not too heavy it is perfect!

Love the vibe of the restaurant. Plus any restaurant with a solid beer list like theirs is my type place!"}
{"text":"The hot dog was good and very large. I'll come back to try a pretzel bun with all beef hot dog. The regular pita they use is just a weird combo. The reason I gave 2 stars was the coffee... I don't think I could buy or make worse iced coffee. 

I asked for liquid sugar and he said he didn't have any (which is weird because regular sugar cannot dissolve in ice), but he was nice and offerred to add \"flavors\" then listed the names starting with carmel. I was thinking it was carmel cane sugar which is liquid sugar so I asked for \"a half a pump of carmel.\" I left without noticing he just put a whole spoon full of carmel in the bottom. If I enjoyed very sweet coffee this would have been nice, but I do not. Luckily he didn't mix it in so when I got home I just dumped the coffee in another cup without the carmel. The second I tasted the coffee I realized the low quality. It's almost like you need tons of sugar and cream to mask the actual taste.

 If you like a little coffee with your sugar and cream I suggest you come here, but if you like good iced coffee, this is absolutely not the place to go.

A couple side notes: 
- I have asked other coffee shops for liquid sugar in downtown Phx and on a couple occasions the worker had no idea that their vanilla cane sugar was actually liquid sugar. 
- I thought that specifying \"a half a pump\" and motioning my hand as if I was pumping the sugar would indicate I was talking about cane sugar.
- I was so sad because I threw away my coffee and just made a fresh pot of my coffee at home :/ I was really looking forward to it. 
- Lastly, the guy working there was really nice and I liked the place. I just know now... never get the coffee lol"}
{"text":"Super delicious! My friend and I both got the Sunny. I opted for an all beef dog instead of the chicken. It was amazing! The different flavors blew my mind. I can't wait to go back again and try the other options. We got a side of French fries to split and they were very thin, just how I like it! The decor is also adorable as everything is \"dog\" themed!"}
{"text":"Great dogs! I called beforehand to ask if they had any vegan dogs and the cashier went to the kitchen and asked. When I got to the restaurant I found out they had pretzel buns and asked about that too. The cashier was really nice and went and asked about that too. I ended up ordering a veggie dog in a pretzel bun with sauerkraut and mustard. The whole thing was so good especially because I was so hungry that day. It was one of the best pretzel buns I've ever had. The cashier was a little confused when I first asked about vegan options but she was really nice and kept checking things for me. Would come here again. It's right by some bars downtown and by a bunch of murals. They have a donut place attached. I didn't ask but I don't think they have vegan options. It's an open space with indoor and outdoor seating. I liked the decor, it was greyish-black with art work and signage. They also had a foosball table  and we played a game. Fun experience, really like this place."}
{"text":"While visiting the metropolitan Phoenix area I decided to post a message on Yelp talk to enlist the assistance of local Yelpers in helping me locate and identify places to pick up some hot dogs during my stay. One of the first places suggested was \"Short Leash\" which apparently has a much longer title of \"Short Leash Dogs Sit.. Stay Restaurant\". A day later I was off in search of this eatery and further more on the hunt for a good hot dog.

After driving past this place several times I eventually spotted the food truck associated with the restaurant on the outside and realized I was there. There wasn't any immediately noticeable signage from Roosevelt street indicating that this was the right place which threw me for a bit of a loop. There is a door to enter from the side near where the truck was parked. I walked in, verified I was at the right place and got a menu. 

After looking over the various hot dog options, all around 8.50 to 9.50 I asked for a recommendation from the lady there and settled on the \"Devil Dog\". I had an option to try it with different types of sausages and went with the all beef hot dog. One interesting note about this place is that it's a waiter/waitress style dining establishment rather than a typical order at a counter and grab your food when it's ready hot dog joint. This place also seems very bar oriented, but because I both don't drink, and it was around 10:30 AM, I stuck with water to compliment my meal. With the Devil Dog, I was offered a choice of chips or salad. Being a straight male I went with the chips.

I snapped a few pictures of the inside while waiting for my food, and in under five minutes the \"Devil Dog\" had arrived. It came wrapped in paper with a toothpick with a pickle on it, the chips being off to the side. I dug into the chips first. These were kettle style chips that were hard but tasty. After eating a few I unwrapped the hot dog from it's paper prison. The hot dog was wrapped in a tortilla, it was a long hot dog that was skinless. The Devil Dog had a red peppers, green peppers, cheese, onions and some seasoning that I can't immediately identify. This tasted very Southwestern and was quite good.  Unfortunately, the tortilla wasn't quite up to the task of holding all the peppers and other ingredients on the hot dog as much of it slopped off, I scooped up some of the remaining peppers with chips.

Overall I found this to be an excellent and non-traditional hot dog. It was a bit on the pricey side but was well worth the money. I was both impressed with and enjoyed my trip to Short Leash and would recommend it. I'm going to give this place a full five star review. Thank you Phoenix area Yelpers for recommending this place."}
{"text":"I tried it for the first time and had the bratwurst in a pretzel bun with sauerkraut. It was good but WAY too much bun and nowhere near enough bratwurst. Asked for the house chips as a side, homemade potato chips, and they were excellent. 

Will give the place another shot but first visit felt like i paid $10.50 for a pretzel bun and chips [ with no drink ]."}
{"text":"I thought I was over hot dogs.

Short Leash has proved me wrong.  I was impressed with the concrete and tiled bar, the sleek and curved wood barstools, the gray and white wallpaper, the cute mantras of good living with fun orange and turquoise colors. 

My wife and I were greeted by a very nice young lady who sat us at a community table.  Maybe it's just me... but I am usually weird about this kind of thing.  I hate to eat in public anyway, since eating time is when I get a chance to relax and not think about putting on a smile or selling something to someone.  You know?  Someone serving me.  Well, this was not the case. In this place, I saw a few people I have known from years in the Phoenix area, and then realized that the community table is a new concept that I actually enjoy.  I look forward to sitting at this table and possibly have a conversation with Alice Cooper, the Mayor, my neighbor, my teacher from 2nd grade.  This concept is especially great for a neighborhood full of artists and college students!  Thanks Short Leash for making me get out of my comfort zone and appreciating my community over great tasting food (at a community table, you are more likely to be offered a bit of someone else's appetizer...)

I am going to keep this leash short - THE FRIED PICKLES are one of the greatest things I have ever stuffed in my face.  The pickles are thick-sliced and prepared with a slight spicy kick (what they put in their brine is a mystery to me).  The panko outside is chunky, crisp, and dry!  Each bite was deep-fried magic

The staff was nice, casual, knowledgeable, and not afraid to make substitutes to give each customer what they are looking for.  

The hot dogs are incredible and range from classic styles to new spins and ingredients with a unique flair that could only be born from a very competitive food truck market!  I ordered the Mac Daddy, and although the meal was not what I expected (I expected macaroni noodles but was surprised to find cheesy penne on my hot dog) I felt that it was a smart move and was probably a healthier and more tasty alternative.   The chili had black beans in it, and I give it a thumbs up too.

When we left, I felt great.  Usually when I consume a meatbrick from a pub or bar I feel like a tub of lard wallowing out into the street.  At Short Leash, I feel like they have really created something fun and savory for Phoenix that left me satisfied, relaxed and entertained."}
{"text":"Wow this place was great!!! The food was DELICIOUS! And I tried a really yummy grapefruit beer, definitely try it! The service was also pretty good! They were very nice people! The outdoor seating was also fabulous! Seriously check this place out"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! I had the Mac and Cheese Hot dog! it was very good, however, I wish that had a tad more macaroni and cheese on it! YOu are able to sit where you want, and its very relaxing atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Came for the Bratwurst Stuffed Pretzel featured by Thrillist- a beer-cooked brat on a house-made pretzel roll, topped with sauerkraut, bacon, onion, and mustard. The sausage was tasty, the bun held up well, and the plating was pretty. Added on a side of fried pickles, and they were thick-cut and clearly fresh-made. There are local beers on tap, and we had a great amber ale. They serve several of their dogs wrapped in naan, which is a fun twist we were looking forward to trying with another order. 

The pickles were amazing but the dog was served at roughly the temperature of the sun, and had so much mustard on it that it was a terrible mess to eat. And then we saw a hair on it. At first I thought it was probably my own from rearranging and photographing my food, but when we cut the dog to share it, my guy found another that clearly was not mine. We didn't touch our food after that, and opted out of the donuts at the adjacent shop as well. Staff didn't say a word as we left after ten minutes and only half our meal."}
{"text":"Um. It was just ok. In all fairness I am not a huge hot dog fan but I was with my 3 year old and he is a hot dog fan so we tried it out. 

I got The Lady. Chipotle cream cheese, grilled onions, and fried pickles. It was too spicy for me (I am a wimp when it comes to spicy stuff anymore). The naan bread was
soft and good. 

My boy got corn dogs from the kids menu and he loved it. Not sure if the kettle child are made fresh but they were good. 

The greens that came with my dog were actually the yummiest part of the meal :)

We got some of the donuts to take home to my other sons. They had a different taste and texture I can't put my finger on but they were good.  

It was just ok for me."}
{"text":"The fried green tomato stack is my new favorite dish in all of Phoenix. ALL. OF. PHOENIX. Seriously try it. 
It's only a matter of time before this dish becomes as infamous as the Stetson Chopped Salad at Cowboy Ciao. If it doesn't, it's a crime."}
{"text":"Delish! Cute spot casual atmosphere! They have a really good beer selection-at least 80+assortment of things to try! 

Ordered the fried pickles they came with dragon sauce (Sriracha and mayo ) and ranch! Loved that the pickles were sweet and they were crunchy and not soggy! We also ordered the pimento cheese dip that is served with deep fried naan bread ( so good)! 

I ordered he pretzel dog (pigs in a blanket on steroids) with a side of Mac and cheese! Large portion I could only eat half! The pretzel was hot and soft and the dog was large and cooked perfect! The Side of cheese is perfect to smear on! Boyfriend got the Bear, woah that was too intense for me but it did come served on the naan bread he said it was a really solid combo! Lastly wanted to say staff there is awesome checked on you cleared plates and helpful.  

Small spot but defiantly worth a shot to check it out - we will be back! FYI 2$ cans of beer on Tuesday's!"}
{"text":"Unique hot dog eatery. Large variety of hot dogs served on naan instead of a bun. I liked it better this way. The fried pickles were very good as well, not too thick batter. I had the Chicago dog and am anxious to try some of the other creations. Service was fine and the atmosphere is what you would expect in a \"hip\" downtown hot dog joint. Nice selection of beers. A little pricey but I'll be back."}
{"text":"I really like this place and I think it's here to stay. Had a spicy beer hot dog with bacon, onion and Swiss. Should have added a sauce; oh well, next time. Had a chocolate chip cookie donut, and that was as decadent as it sounds. They lose a star because the service, though friendly, is really slow. We walked in at 12:30 and the dogs didn't come til 1:05. I get that these are upscale dogs and all, but it may be hard to satisfy big crowd with that sort of lag time. Still, great little place. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Here's the universal truth: all veggie dogs suck. Really, really hard. There are no good ones. Therefore, the toppings and bun of a veggie dog must be really spectacular to make it an enjoyable. Short Leash succeeds at this with all their creative combos and delicious naan. I've tried a few at their truck, but I'll always be partial to the first one I ever tried, the Igby. The spicy barbecue sauce, coleslaw and blue cheese makes my mouth water.

At the restaurant, I was finally able to try the green tomato stack, something I've been seeing on instagram all summer. It definitely lived up to the hype, and I'm sure the bacon I left off takes it over the top. I'm glad they had some Dos Cabezas wine on tap, but it would be great to see their 4 item wine selection expanded.

Sit...Stay is a great option for downtown dining. If they could somehow come up with a tasty, housemade veggie dog, I'd give them a million glittery stars."}
{"text":"Finally went to short leash.  I had been wanting to hit this place up for like a year. Seemed every plan to changed to somewhere else.  But went and had a great meal. The whole menu looked amazing, so hard to choose.  I will have to go back soon.  The people working were really friendly and very attentive.  The location and ambiance is very cool.  The restaurant lies right in the heart of the art district.  

I ordered the Lady with bratwurst. Basically, I ordered this one because it had fried pickles on it.  Really wanted to try them but not order an appraiser just for me.  really enjoyed the hot dog on a flat-bread.  I ordered the chips with the dog.  They were really good, but i found they needed a lil flavor added to them or at least salted better. They were very good but only thing I'd change.  Overall a great location to enjoy a dog and a beer."}
{"text":"The best hot dog I have ever had! My choice of the day was Oliver (Swiss cheese, 1000 island dressing and  sauerkraut). Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding dogs! I had the IGBY (blue cheese, BBQ sauce, coleslaw with an all beef dog. It was a great tasting dog and ample size to fill up the stomach! Their fries were excellent as well. I am headed back again when I get back downtown! Definitely worth a try!!!!"}
{"text":"Try the Bear. It looks weird with peanut butter and what not, but it's delicious. I was really surprised that I liked it!"}
{"text":"Hot dog with peanut butter ? That just sound like it's not a good idea. I went in wit my buddy to see wat all the fuss is about , ok food ."}
{"text":"Sit....Stay- you complete me. 

I had to try the place out on opening night. My wingman and I got there and there was already a line out the door. We went down the way to grab a beer as our wait time was estimated at two hours. 

While waiting outside they handed out water and free apps, cus that's how Short Leash Dogs roll. With legions of SLD fans, it was cool to chat with other people while we waited. After about 2.5 hours my name was called we were seated at the communal table. I must admit, historically I'm not a fan of the concept of sitting next to strangers- but I love SLD so I went with it, and was glad that I did. Before long, you have made new friends and it's fun chatting with people. I strongly recommend just relaxing and enjoying the experience. 

I ordered the pig in a blanket, which was so amazing, and comes with mashed potatoes and gravy, with green beans on the side. They have delicious icy beers on tap and my beer was perfect. Brandon was our server and he was polite, charming, and on point. 

Sit....Stay is a smash success. The food, ambiance, and people are second to none. It's truly an American Success story. Brad and Kat started Short Leash and worked 7 days a week. Years later their brick and mortar location and it kicks ass.  Well done guys, I look forward to years of having amazing food at your great restaurant."}
{"text":"Came in here earlier for a donut and didn't realize that Rollover Donuts and SLHD were connected! I got a donut and some Frito Pie. The Frito Pie is really from the kid's menu but it was perfect as a snack and surprisingly filling! Other kid's items include a corn dogs and a mac & cheese casserole. 

*Easily accessible via Lightrail

Coming back to try one of their 20 dogs and hope to catch their food truck sometime."}
{"text":"Food was better then expected. Very tasty stuff. Also great doughnuts. Great food experience. Service absolutely sucked. Terrible waitress. Never checked on us. We ordered iced coffee and she kind of slammed on the table and walked off. I went to the bar for cream and sugar. That's just an example. Never made eye contact, not even while taking our orders.
I would like to try it again, but no way will I sit at one of her tables. Great food/worst service around. They lose her and it gets 5 stars. The food was delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've had some excellent service every time and they have a great selection of dogs and doughnuts for everyone. Make sure to get the chips!!! Although I wish their tap beer selection had a little more variety.!"}
{"text":"We came here on a recommendation from a friend who's not even from this country! So I guess their name travels far and wide! 
And I wasn't disappointed. We tried 3 different hot dogs and all 3 were tasty in their own right. But the best one (for me) was the Devil Dog! It's spicy! Imagine, when an Indian says it's spicy! The taste buds just explode. Have a cold one handy. Their extensive beer menu does come in handy here. 

I'm certainly hooked and will head back soon."}
{"text":"I LOVE HOT DOGS! AND THIS PLACE HAS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE. 

My daughter had a sunny dog. She said it was phenomenal. My husband had something rather too spicy for me. But he loved it. My son had the pretzel bread bratwurst which was very good. Although he thought the brat was not tasty enough. I judged my dog the winner! A very tasty chicken dog with spicy mustard and lots of sweet relish - just the way I like it! 

All dogs are served on naan, a tasty and less bready alternative to a bun! Well done Short Leash. We will be back should we pass this way again!"}
{"text":"Love short leash!
The restaurant is very cute inside.
The fried pickles are amazing. 
The hot dogs are good and I love that they are on Naan bread. I always get the lady kind..
We usually will go here when we are downtown for a baseball game. 
However, I wish they had a location in North Phoenix. 
Would recommend to all for a casual night out on the town."}
{"text":"I made a custom dog with bacon, cheese, BBQ sauce and onion.   best dog I've ever had.

I'm not a fan of pickles at all but the person I went with wanted to fried pickles so she ordered some and said they were amazing,  I tried a few pieces and I actually liked them."}
{"text":"I decided tonight that I was going to be lazy and order from uber eats. I love hotdogs so I decided to give this place a try. 

I ordered a Mac and cheese dog, but with no chili, since I'm just not a fan of vegetable chili. The order arrives and I guess someone mixed it up and put online chili on instead of just Mac and cheese. Usually I'll just suck it up and deal with it, but again, not a fan of chili. So I called and a nice woman told me to reorder the order on uber eats and she would take care of the rest. 

A few minutes later she called me and said everything was taken care of and that my new order would be sent out. 

My food arrived, with an additional donut! Which was awesome. And the Mac and cheese dog was delicious. I'll definitely order from them again. Great food and great customer service."}
{"text":"Finally made it down into this part of town to check out what everyone else was barking about. Really love the Hot Dog and they do a totally different kind of spin on this puppy.

The restaurant is in an older building that has been around the block a few times. They definitely did a fine job fixing it up and giving it a nicely revamped interior. It is simple yet modern in a unique way.

Ordered the Devil Dog with an all Beef Hot Dog and then a Bear Dog with the Spicy Beer Hot Dog. My eyes were apparently bigger than my stomach and I could barely finish the bear. Lions, Tigers and Bears ... Oh My!

The menu has plenty of choices and different ways that you can build your own Dog. They even have several appetizers and some tasty beers on tap when you need to wet your whistle.

Both the food and service were delightful. Everyone there was having a great time and even saw plenty of families getting together on my Sunday visit to break Naan.

This place is really popular. So popular that I had the special occasion to meet Mr. Laz C and his lovely family at the adjacent table next to me. Noticed he checked in at the same time and had not met him before. Looked around and there he was finishing off his tasty meal. Couldn't resist a quick shout out and a handshake.

Bring the family and a good appetite and you will not be disappointed. Parking is a little sparse and the weekend crowd was not too crazy. Most of all don't forget to check in and see who else is there eating at the same time. WUZ UP BRO!

{"text":"Amazing as always. Friendly staff and great food! I love the BEAR (aka seventh inning stretch) It may sound strange on paper but with everything together magic happens! Try it! You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Went to PHX on a business trip and needed a quick place for lunch. Found this place on yelp and it definitely delivered.

The staff was very friendly and recommended some things on the menu. I had the Aiko hot dog which was awesome! I also had a special for that day, don't remember what, but that was also pretty tasty.

Overall it was a great experience and I was able to find this place thanks to all the reviews!"}
{"text":"Waited for 2 hours just to get seated at the grand opening last night (National Hot Dog Day!) and it was, as expected, well worth the wait. If you've never visited the food truck... Short Leash is known for their funky combinations/toppings but have no fear... they are just as complex and delicious as they are strange. My personal favorite is the Devil Dog (green chiles, jalapenos, sriracha, onions) but when vegetarian chili is available the Mac Daddy (mac n cheese & chili) is going to happen.

Congrats to the owners on such success!"}
{"text":"Yum.  I'm not a hot dog person.  I can take them or leave them.  But last week, after an evening at Sidebar, we decided to give the location a shot.  (Previously, we had Short Leash Dogs when they catered a friend's wedding.)  Even though they were closing a half hour, service was good and the dogs were (again) delish."}
{"text":"First off, I think it's awesome that Short Leash has gone from a food truck to the downtown location and recently opened a location at the Biltmore. I love to see local businesses thrive in our city!

The location downtown is super chic, hip and a place where you want to have a beer and hot dog. Don't forget a side of that fantastic creamy mac and cheese... YUM!

I ordered the Chicago dog without sweet relish and add spicy pickles. My husband ordered the Lady and my stepdaughter ordered the kids corn dogs. Unfortunately, my Chicago dog came out with sweet relish and without spicy pickles. The server did a great job with exchanging out my dog for what I ordered, was apologetic, and was friendly about the situation. My husband hates sweet pickles, which comes on the Lady, but he didn't ask to change his order. Much to his surprise, he loves the dog exactly how it was made and was glad he didn't alter it. The kids corn dogs were good and what you would exact. Overall, great customer service and good dogs.

Here are the reasons my review was broughtdown from 5 to 4 stars include:

While the servers were very friendly and when I asked for something they provided it, it seemed one more person would have been helpful. There was only one person taking orders and one person checking on the tables. Because there were only two people in the dinning room, when someone would sit down at the table, they were asked to either order at the podium or bar. I would like to see the order being taken right away. Our order took a little longer than anticipated as well."}
{"text":"Fun little place with great service. I had the Lady which was really good and the naan surprisingly works really well. The accompanying salad was a nice side but too overdressed and small in portion. My only complaint is that I was still hungry after my $10 dog! I could get 4 polish sausages and 4 sodas at costco for that price. I know, not in the same boat...but just saying."}
{"text":"First time  buyers.  Menu  is limited but lots of condiments.  Tried their polish dog it was a little pricy. The dog was tasty and we added so  added extra hot sauce. We would try again"}
{"text":"Ok, I admit I was skeptical when someone from the office suggested going here for lunch.  Just hot dogs, I asked?  But I'm a foodie, so I figured I'd try it.  Boy, am I glad I did.  I never saw so many exotic combos of dogs...not only toppings for them, but what was INSIDE them!  I wound up going for the more healthy turkey dog, with simply kraut and ketchup.  Wow, even that was great.  It was served on warm pita --genius---that was less bun to impede the flavor of the dog!  The dog was crispy on the outside and delish on the inside.  I got it with a little side salad, which is the option if you don't get their chips.  I also tasted their chips...quite good also.  The waitstaff were very helpful and explained all the different choices.  And if you have a sweet tooth, they offer their own doughnuts.  There is also a good selection of bottled drinks to accompany your dog.  If you like dogs or brats, you owe it to yourself to check this placed out!"}
{"text":"They've got the hot dogs.
You want the hot dogs.
This is where you get the hot dogs downtown! 

Unfortunately the hot dogs do not taste very good and that is putting it politely. I have tried several variations including the chicago dog and the moki and each time i am less than thrilled.

Per their website: \"At Short Leash Hotdogs our mission is to create a unique twist on a classic favorite\".

I think this is part of the problem; No one asked for a hot dog served in naan bread, it's strange and unwelcome. The issue for me is the ratio of naan to hot dog, it is completely and utterly out of whack. The dogs themselves (you can choose between beef/brat etc...) are small, particularly when placed at the bottom of a parachute-sized naan.

I recently gave the chicago dog another shot. Their food truck was situated at Hance park for an event. I was let down again, I was also figuratively let down as all of the toppings fell out of the naan as I picked it up to take a bite. It seems to me that they just don't really try that hard and it shows in the food. 

The staff is always polite and the actual restaurant is in a good location on Roosevelt Row but I think the concept is where they went wrong. I will not eat there again, there are far better options in the area."}
{"text":"Short leash was on my list of places to eat while in Az though unfortunately due to our busy weekend, and my very long list of places to eat, we just couldn't find time.

Well the stars were in our favor because on our way back from grubbing at Welcome Diner and through the arts district, sure shit enough there it was, short leash dogs.  I mean I wasn't hungry but there's no sense in passing up the opportunity, you know?

We walked in and had a chat with the nice lady at the counter. I ordered the pretzel dog to go because we had the light rail to catch.  It came out nicely packaged with some fresh potato chips. While waiting for our train, I took a large (as if I were hungry) bite of my pretzel dog and wow it was a good bite. The pretzel was extra salty and the hotdog had a good crunch to it. I gave my hubs a bite then took over the remainder.

Ah funny thing, that evening, while we were at the Whatever USA/ Budlight event, short leash truck was there too (free food!) and I tried the crispy one with the jalapeno cheese beef dog. I'm glad it was available because that was the other dog option I considered while at short leash. Man oh man that was so freaking delicious. I got a few more and then a few more thereafter. Even the hubs really loved them too.

Happy we got to try short leash, though super sad we can't get it in CA. Since then, I've craved that crispy dog numerous days in a row!"}
{"text":"I so love everything about these guys!! Love their truck, love their restaurant, love their food and love the owners!! So happy for them and their success!!"}
{"text":"Decent donuts. I enjoyed the brioche donuts here, but the other cake and yeast varieties were just good. Extra points for unusual flavors, including pistachio. It's a nice space to hang out in too."}
{"text":"Short Leash? Yes please! I had the pleasure of having brunch at Short Leash on Sunday. They have the best bloody mary's ever. I'm absolutely in love with their blue cheese olives and spicy green beans. Mon Diue. I could eat an entire jar of those green beans willingly, and free of shame.  I am not really a hot dog eater (I read The Jungle and haven't been able to eat them since) so I ordered home fries which were delightfully delicate and crispy (it tasted like they were cooked in duck fat) and a breakfast sandwich. Which was also delightful and delicious. The menu had lots of items that catered to my vegetarian friends, and everyone seemed super happy with their orders. 

I've been looking for a better brunch spot since I moved downtown and I finally found it! Good drinks, great service, wonderful food. You should go!"}
{"text":"Holy moley, I've been late to this party for awhile! Today, I ordered to go from short leash; my husband and I were trying them out for the first time. Called in my order, ready in 10 mins! Way better than postmates, which would have taken an hour. We ordered a Cubano, the Millie, a side of fried pickles and an order of poutine. The hot dogs were so amazingly delicious, and the spicy dogs delivered a perfect amount of heat. The pickles, both on the cubano and the fried variety, were a delicious blend of sweet, salty and spicy. And the poutine was like salty, cheesy heaven. Definitely cured my \"hanger!\" Would absolutely try again!"}
{"text":"Great spot we stopped at, dogs were delish, fried pickles were really good and the craft beer selection is on point, Odell Brewing was there and a pinewood derby just happened to be going in, will return again for sure."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible!  Sat at the bar for 5 minutes and no one even acknowledged us.  Totally rude staff.  Sign says welcome 1st Fridays peeps - not so much.  Don't bother."}
{"text":"Holy Chicago Dog heaven! No need to visit the windy city to find the perfect dog, we have one right here in our backyard! 

We popped into Short Leash on First Friday and it was busy but we were able to find a table for 7 pretty quickly! The service was quick, beer selection in amazing, and the food - well if you are a hot dog eater, you'll be in heaven! They have a variety of different dogs to choose from with extremely unique toppings. I switched out the pita bun for a pretzel bun which I HIGHLY recommend doing. It was so dang soft and tasty! My ONLY complaint was that the toppings were so plentiful, that it was hard to get a bite with everything. The toppings fell off pretty easily! But that is what a fork is for, I suppose! 

We will absolutely be back the next time we're craving a hot diggity dog!"}
{"text":"We had a lovely lunch here on a Saturday. The owner knows us by name, so that's pretty awesome. The interior is hip, clean and cheery. It feels just like you would expect the inside of the food truck to feel. The owners have clearly put their stamp on every inch of this establishment, and it shows. I had the Sunny and my husband tried their pulled-pork sandwich special. I was not blown away with the bread to topping ratio. It was a bit too much bread for my liking. However, it won't stop me from coming back in the future and supporting this awesome local business!"}
{"text":"Don't be afraid of The Bear, it's delicious.

I only have one bad thing to say about Short Leash: the side salad is crap. It's literally just a bunch of dry lettuce leaves, maybe a little wet from when they were washed. I just put it on my hot dog, because eating it alone was sad. Is it that hard to add a splash of oil and vinegar? I can eat plain lettuce at home. 

Other than that, I love this place. Again, don't let The Bear scare you. Do it."}
{"text":"Loved this place! If you are from NY looking for a Nathan's hotdog, this is not the place. But if you want a great hotdog done with a great wrap or pretzel, this is the place. Prices are very reasonable and food is fantastic! A hotdog is not complete without a beer! A very large selection of beers, including local beers! Met the owner while dining on a Saturday afternoon! Very freindly place! 5 Stars all round and recommend!"}
{"text":"Who let the dogs out?! Yes, cheesy.. I get it.. but never in a million years would I say I liked a hot dog joint! They have beef, pork, veggie, and chicken (I think). The latter two is what I can comment on. The veggie is a wee bit bland, but the chicken is quite tasty. I usually get the Devil Dog (spicy goodness) without onions. 

I've also had the fried pickles (heavenly) and the fried tomatoes and corn dogs. Do I feel good about myself after I leave here?! Absolutely not, but do I enjoy it going down YAASSS!

Next up: Pies.. I've heard great things."}
{"text":"I got recently introduced to this eatery! Wow! Delish! I typically don't like fried pickles. But now I am a regular here just because of this item on the menu. I have eaten here a few times now and their Chicago dog is a bomb! I highly recommend this little place. The food is very good."}
{"text":"This is the first food truck I experienced in Phoenix. The actual restaurant on Roosevelt has an expanded menu. I would recommend their hotdog wrapped in bread. The sides are all good--fries or cold slaw---and everything is served in this amazing metal tins with compartments. I also like the hotdog with sauerkraut and thousand island dressing. On the donuts side, come early or the best, fresh made choices might be gone like the coconut spicy Thai one. Overall, a fun place to have lunch and sit outside on the patio or inside when it's too hot outside."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this.  I've been a fan of the food truck for a long time now.  So when they opened up a brick-and-mortar restaurant, I couldn't wait to try it out.

I visited on a Friday night, and the place was packed.  It's not a very large place to begin with, but it was busy.  We sat down to wait and, while waiting, the hostess brought out glasses of ice water to help keep us cool.  Finally, we were seated in one of their few tables and ordered our meals.  My wife ordered the Sunny dog & salad plate and it was perfect... peaches, grilled chicken sausage, goat cheese all wrapped in the naan bread with a salad on the side made for a delicious dinner.  I tried the Pig in a Blanket, and the mashed potatoes & dog were fantastic.  The green beans were a little on the raw saw, but overall a good dish.

Overall, the food was good.  The hot dogs and sausages were still the stars here.  The only problem with this is that I could get those from the food truck at a reduced price.  If I'm paying $9 or $11 for an entree, I want something better than just a good hot dog.  And unfortunately, the ambiance was only so-so, as it was a loud, open room with no air conditioning.  It didn't feel like a place that I could settle down and enjoy for a night out.  

In summary, good food but nothing that stands out compared to the food truck.  The service was wonderful at the restaurant, but I've always received wonderful service at the food truck as well.  And given the price difference for a sit-down meal as opposed to just a quick food truck stop, I'd rather stick with the food truck."}
{"text":"It's just ok. Nothing spectacular. The taste is ok, the serving is small, for the size it's really pricey... The naan bread kind of keeps the hot dog and toppings neat but since the dog is so small it makes it super bready. 

TIP: order the chicken sausage. Skip everything else. I don't recommend anything from this place. It lacks flavor, especially their tasteless homemade chips. Skip that too. Yes, just skip this place period. Best tip ever =)"}
{"text":"Great fried pickles! 

So as a vegetarian, the veggie dog is pretty disappointing. It's so small, it gets lost in the toppings and the naan. They really need to find an alternative. If they had a better veggie dog, the concept is fun so I would probably have given them a 5 star review. 

Other than the dog, their fried pickles were awesome, and we had great service. I also indulged and had an orange glazed pistachio donut.... AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I now see what I've been missing.  I've always known Short Leash was the most popular of the Downtown Phoenix food trucks, but now that they've got a brick and mortar restaurant, I no longer have to chase down their food truck to taste this piece of hot dog heaven.  Their restaurant has a pretty modern feel, though small enough that it feels like part of the neighborhood.  My girlfriend had a craving for the fried pickles so we started with that as an appetizer (and washed em down with some Kiltlifters).  But the main event was the hot dogs.  Holy God, so awesome.  I got a Spicy Bear (Peanut Butter, Gouda, bacon, barbecue sauce, and cracker jacks on top of a spicey beer sausage wrapped in pita bread).  Its was a party for my mouth.  She got the Igby Brat (coleslaw, blue cheese, barbecue sauce on a bratwurst wrapped in pita bread).  I honestly never thought hot dogs could be so fun or creative (or mindblowingly delicious).  They also let you build your own dog from amongst over 30 available ingredients.  The server we had helped us through the selection process and was very friendly.  And vegetarians can rejoice as they have vegetarian dogs with vegetarian ingredients to choose from.  I could sing the praises about this place all day, but if you're in the Roosevelt District looking for a hot dog fix, it really doesn't get any better than this."}
{"text":"Great spot for a truly unique hot dog. Don't be afraid to try the bear. The combination of cheese, peanut butter, BBQ sauce, bacon and cracker jacks makes for on tasty dog. Impressive selection of local and regional craft beers to top off your meal. Give it a try."}
{"text":"I must be from an alternate financial world when it comes to prices here.  Some of the best dogs Chicago has to offer are $7 with fries....and downtown in the highest rent districts.  Often times they're less than that.  Here $8 +$3 fries.  A $5 premium?  wtf?
At Gene and Judes (Chicago) which happens to have its own wikipedia page and chosen as the best dogs in America, with fries they're $2.69.....and no tipping!  They're still making a profit.
Short Leash, PHX is your market."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and service are awesome. I came in a group of 5. Together we got 7 different dogs and no one was disappointed. Only raving reviews. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Five score years ago two great Americans, Brad and Kat, signed the Short Leash food truck proclamation. This momentous decree of great bacon, sausages, naan bread and gourmet toppings will be seared in the flames of delicious. But years later we face the tragic fact that we are still not free, not free to eat Short Leash when we want it.

But there is something that I must say to my people who stand in the long lines which leads into the palace of delicious. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and eat Short Leash whenever we want. I have a dream that one day we will be able to sit down together at a table inside a restaurant. I have a dream today. 

It's not every day that dreams become reality, but the dream of dining at Short Leash on a whim, whenever we feel like, without waiting in lines has come to fruition.

I had the privilege of visiting during their friends and family preview, and left with great conviction to visit over and over again. They've got a few restaurant only items on their menu like Scotch Eggs, savory Funnel Cakes, and a few other gems I'll let you discover for yourself. They're serving beer and wine on their menu now, with a pitcher costing you just $7.50

Short Leash Sit...Stay will be a great addition to Roosevelt Row's way of life.

Happy Yelping Phoenix, I can't wait to see you there!"}
{"text":"Had the bear dog, Scotch eggs, and on a separate visit I had the Moki dog, and my wife had the crispy dog breakfast. I have to say, the Moki is my favorite so far. It reminds me of a Sonoran dog like down in Tucson, very tasty. The crispy dog breakfast is also excellent. And I've never had scotch eggs before, but I highly recommend it as an appetizer. Overall great food and friendly service. 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"Watched a movie downtown and was driving home but realized it was the first friday of the month with all the tents and foodtrucks downtown.  
We were hungry and my hubby had been here before and liked it a lot so we decided to eat here.  Walked in, it was a bit busy but no line.
Server at the walk up counter was super helpful explaining the food and nice.
I got the devil dog with a chicken frank.  Hubby got chicago dog and devil dog both with all beef franks.
Got our number and headed outside to grab a seat and people watch.
I really wanted to love this place as I love hot dogs.
I must have missed the memo as the hot dogs came out in flatbread?
Te devil dog was nice and spicy because of the jalapenos but it wasnt a knock it out of the park meal.  Got a bite of hubby's chicago dog and it was better.  
Service was definitely on point and the location is great.  
Best part was there was a little entertainment with live music and the singer they hired sounded just like Adele.
I will come back and try another dog...i hear pretzel buns are available too but I am not a pretzel fan."}
{"text":"Great place off the beaten path with a unique take on a classic! Great homemade hotdogs wrapped in naan and dressed with all kinds of amazing toppings! Add some locally brewed beer and I'm pretty much in heaven!"}
{"text":"Being able to sit down and eat a short leash hot dog in their very own restaurant for the first time made the food taste even better. Their building is purple on the outside, so it's hard to miss! Always easy to find parking, we walked right in. I was comfortable, the room is simple, and the sunshine barely coming in felt cozy.

The waiter was a little bit silly; he didn't attend us right away even in a near-empty restaurant, and he forgot to get me my soda pop. He was really sweet, so I didn't really let it get to me. 

I only wish that they weren't so expensive. A custom dog is about $9. I still recommend this place! Everyone needs to try a short leash hot dog once in their life, and shame on them if their prices steer them away. Your stomach won't regret it, I promise. 

(And make sure to try their traditional soda pop - it's all part of the experience!)"}
{"text":"Delicious- Fried pickles, side salad, braut in pretzel.  Giant portions."}
{"text":"It was my first time in today, and I will Definitely be back. The vibe is cute, a little hipster-y. They've got a bar with a few drafts, tons of craft beer cans, and a few cocktails. It's counter service, so you order and sit- with plenty of tables inside and out to pick from. 

As for the food, it was sooo good. I don't eat meat, but my boyfriend does. I got a build-your-own veggie dog, with mayo, relish, onion, ketchup and mustard. It was exactly what I was craving. 
My boyfriend got the Moki (I believe) with all beef dog, which is similar to a Sonoran dog. He absolutely loved it.

They use naan instead of traditional buns, and I will say it's a little excessive as the naan is so much bigger than the hotdogs. It was very delicious, though, and well worth the left over bits of bread."}
{"text":"I have a dog so being able to bring him to dinner is always a plus, but it makes it even better when the place provides doggie water bowls!! 
We came on First Friday so it was busy, our order got stuck behind a big order so our waitress went out of her way to give us a complimentary treat to tide us over. 
Great Vibes, Great Patio Area, Great People Watching and Great Customer Service!!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite.  Everyone is friendly, great food and service. We split to the jalape√±o poppers and the pretzel dog with the Mac and cheese.  
They also have a great selection of craft beers"}
{"text":"Came here to grab some dogs before the baseball game.  I don't know if it was worth the hype but def a place you need to check out.  Ordered the three most famous dogs.  Moki with bacon, lady and igby.  Get the spicy sausage, that's the tastiest."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The owners are awesome. The customer service is on point. They have a wide selection of craft beer."}
{"text":"Great place for one drink.  Why one drink? Cause you only see your server once. We waited almost 15 min before we got our drink order then saw her only once.  Really excited to see a gourmet hot dog place with cocktails but the whole service of our server made it a bad experience."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch.   Started with the green tomato stack, which was really good.   We went with the Akko and the devil dog.   Each was o.k.   I was bummed that they were already \"out\" of a lot of options I wanted...no spicy beer dog, no polish...so we had to go with regular dogs which aren't worth the $9.00 premium.   The chips were fresh and pretty good although a little under seasoned.   I was a little thrown off that the fried pickles didn't come with a dipping sauce and unfortunately I didn't see my server again until it was already too late.   The pluses...the naan makes for a better dog."}
{"text":"I've had gourmet  hotdogs from a few places over the years.  They all fall short after having Short Leash.  

I had the Devil Dog with some added bacon, Becca had the Bear and my friends had some build your own types.  The table was completely quiet after our food arrived.  All of us focused on our meals.  

One of my friends that joined us spent the rest of his weekend telling everyone he could about the most amazing hotdog he'd ever had in his life."}

I got one of the \"supreme\" hotdogs or whatever which was a dollar more ($9.50ish).  It sounded good, brat cooked in beer, covered with saurkraut and bacon.  The brat was as big as a pointer finger and the pretzel bun was slightly larger than a dinner roll.  So picture pig in blanket with much larger roll and a pig that's just a little bigger.  Not proportional, and kind of messy - people get this off a truck and are able to eat it without a fork and knife??

The pita bread with pimento cheese was actually very good, however, the bread was SO greasy.  We were thinking we should go back for this and beer, but realized its probably not a great idea.

Maybe the dogs off the truck are a little bigger?  It would definitely have to be several dollars cheaper for this to work..  The beer selection was pretty good though and value priced."}
{"text":"I have never been able to get to Short Leash Dogs' food truck since I am a teacher and can't get out for a lunch break downtown.  So, I was really happy to find out they now have a restaurant!  A large group of my friends and I ate here before heading out to enjoy First Friday.  Supporting a local spot who uses the finest locally made hot dogs and sausages is where it's at.  

Their fried pickles are certainly worth an order and perfect for sharing with friends.  Another friend ordered the funnel cakes with chive remoulade and capers...they loved it, while I didn't seem to adjust to the taste combo.  Meh.  

I had myself a regular Igby.  Cole slaw. BBQ Sauce. Blue Cheese.  And of course the best thing a hot dog could go in...their flat bread.  I'm not sure why I didn't like this one since all I've ever heard about is how delicious their dogs are.  But I was a bit underwhelmed by this one.  Dang!  Somehow the coleslaw was too well...cabbagey, while the BBQ sauce was not tangy enough.  It overpowered the blue cheese too much.  I was too chicken to try the Bear with peanut butter and cracker jacks.  So, I am going for the Devil Dog next time!  Or I'll possibly create my own, but I don't consider myself a hot dog flavor combo connoseiur and would rather rely on Short Leash's expertise.  

If you are a fan of their food truck, definitely step in to Sit...Stay.  Or better yet, if you've been waiting to grab a bite...get in there!  

P.S. I did have the pleasure of devouring their sausage stuffed green chiles at the Chile Pepper Festival this year and it was totally tasty!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  It has a great vibe and excellent food.  The dogs are served in a pita instead of a boring bun.  The prices are fair.  The place is spotless."}
{"text":"They have a good selection if dogs. I love the moki with a veggie dog. It's so good. I add slaw to it. Yum."}
{"text":"I really like the Moki, it is what I order every time.  The green chile could be hotter, but that is a preference.  The best part is the naan the hotdog comes on.  Also I like that you can pick the type of dog, chicken, beer, hot etc."}
{"text":"Oh come on who doesn't like the classic hotdog?!

But here you can take that classic shoved in your face with a myriad of other toppings and assortments. 

how is that not the greatest invention since Betty White-- did you know she was invented before the invention of sliced bread? I mean seriously, what the fuck, that's the bee's knees. 

Anyway I'm gonna give this 4.5 stars. They obviously have a dam good thing going here some of the best hotdogs my fat ass has ever had. 

Now I'm off in search of the best Hot Cats... I have the sneaking suspicion it will be an Asian restaurant that serves them."}
{"text":"Unique dining addition to the downtown scene!  We stopped by for dinner last night with friends prior to a performance at the Phoenix Theatre.  The space is quaint...nothing over the top with the design, but comfortable.  The service was friendly and efficient too.  The food was great...unique in its presentation and a super extensive menu.  Everyone should be able to find something they like.  

I tried the bratwurst on a pretzel roll with mustard and a side of mac 'n cheese - delicious!  Our group also tried the Lady, the Bear and the Pigs in a Blanket.  Everyone finished their meal with no complaints!"}
{"text":"Now you may think you're not a hot dog person, but think twice. This place will convert just about any uninterested non-hot dog eating human. Who knew hot dogs cud be as creative & gourmet as this?

And like are you kidding me!  \"The Bear\" has peanut butter, cracker jacks, bbq sauce & gouda. How could this possibly be as delicious as my taste buds are telling me?!  You gotta check this place out!  Creative genius."}
{"text":"What a disappointing visit to this place. 

First of all, the employees working up front (bless their hearts) were freaking clueless. 

We asked, \"What's in your veggie chili?\" 

The response, \"I don't actually know. Beans\" 

Ok dude. Then there was confusion asking if they used the veggie dog in the chili (my bad, you don't know yeah) and the dude thought we were ordering a veggie dog. 

He answered the phone twice while taking our order. 

If you have a kids menu, and high chairs, a changing table in at least one restroom would be appreciated. Not excited to change my kid on the floor next to a urinal that is filthy and caked in urine. 

The food: the only saving grace. I got the Chicago dog with spicy beer option. It was really good. Significant other and baby boy got the veggie chili fries (which we had mass confusion over when delivered- thankfully the only competent employee in this place, the cook, came out to assure us we got what we wanted) and the Mac n cheese (which is really good) 

I ordered an iced tea, but realized after I left, I never even got the iced tea I paid for. Probably because I was so involved with the cluelessness of the staff. He did carry the high chair outside for us (which was the one helpful thing he did during our experience) 


Was really craving this place today but after this visit I think I've gotten my fill for quite a while. Like forever while."}
{"text":"Just plain tasty. Lots of great toppings choices. The \"sunny\" was actually really good. Nice cold pilsner to wash everything down as well. Good service to boot."}
{"text":"I went to this place a few weeks ago and the food is still on my mind. The hot dogs are excellent and though filling, make you want to go back for more. I will say that it does have a lot of breading - rather than normal buns, they use naan or pretzel buns. It makes for a unique experience and the toppings really fill up the experience. Available on UberEATs as well, I won't lie - I ordered it again the next day. I still want to go back."}
{"text":"Over the past year, I have patronized Short Leash on Roosevelt several times.  The food is delicious, different and enjoyable.  

BUT... it is really the staff that makes this place work.  A server is supposed to ask if everything is okay, or if you need anything else.  Here, you feel less like a customer and more like a guest."}
{"text":"Had the best hot dog ever yesterday when Short Leash was set up at the Carnival De Coronado event. Their food truck is very cool and service was super. Lots of amazing options for adults and kids."}
{"text":"Hot dogs yay, donuts nay..
The donuts will fool you as they look amazing and are definitely creative. I'm a donut fiend and I just didn't like em. Tried maple bacon, pb, and coffee cake. Non of which really impressed me. The Bear is a different story.."}
{"text":"We were in town for a conference and to visit family. We arrived on a Friday at 5 pm and loved this place. We had a toddler and two kids in tow and this place was very kid friendly. The staff was so nice. We had a large group and pushed tables together. I had the pretzel dog and the cheese dipping sauce was delish. The fried pickles were different as they used bread and butter pickles but they were very good, somewhat spicy, as well as the devil dog dipping sauce. My sister had the hot dog on naan bread with BBQ and coleslaw - delish!! My husband and I split the maple doughnut with chopped bacon on top. Would definitely get that one again. I did try the crumbcake one and wouldn't recommend it. Tons of cinnamon and not that sweet. The kids had mac and cheese and the corn dog bites and were thrilled. Definitely coming back to this place. Thanks so much for being so nice to the kids!!"}
{"text":"Was lucky enough to catch Short Leash Hot Dogs on The Go, at Record Store Day by StinkWeeds.  The guy setting up seemed nice. He eventually took our order.  My daughter and ordered a couple of Coke's, 2 Moki's dogs  and 1 order  of fried pickles to try.  Food was done very quick, but they didn't have our fried pickles.  They did make us an order right away.  The Hot dogs were good. The Moki is like a bite of chili on your Hot Dog, kinda.  :)  I like that the offer so many toppings. Lot's of interesting ones, peanut butter? lol.   They also offer different hot dog choices, including a veggie dog!!     I would like to try the Olive Combo next. Hey, those Fried Pickles were awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I loved this restaurant. They have fantastic food and is totally worth the drive. They have pretty big portion sizes so you can share one hotdog. They also have fantastic homemade donuts. They have local beer (which the boyfriend loves) and Uno on every table (which I love). Would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Definitely not a healthy sport but very unique and tasty food. This place also has an underrated happy hour and alcohol selection."}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection. Nice staff. Donuts. Kid friendly. Cool space.  Food delist. Did I say donuts."}
{"text":"I got the brat. I've had better brat at outdoor bbqs. The German bun wasn't that good either.  Sauerkraut was decent.  The salad that came with it was good.  Service was excellent. I'll try something else next time"}
{"text":"Iv'e been here a few times now, sampled a handful of things off the menu and still don't want to come back. The place just isn't for me. 

My first experience was a takeout order. My friend ordered the bear and the corndog bites. The bites were delicious! The bear was weird. Peanut butter and hot dog was just too odd of a combo for me. And I should have realized then what I was getting into eating a hotdog on a piece of naan bread. 

My second try was on July 4th - hot dog day pretty much. They were out of the pretzel buns - bummer because that eliminated my two top choices. Ordered a build your own with all beef hot dog, ketchup, mustard, mayo, relish. WAY too many condiments and way too much bread. I get they're trying to be original with the naan instead of buns, but the dog was sliding out with every bite, and the condiments were spilling out the back. The dog had good flavor but I stopped eating because it was seriously messy. The beer was great, but it didn't save the night. 

Third try. Finally got tot try the pretzel bun with bratwurst and sauerkraut. Huge letdown. Again way too much bread. The pretzel bun was huge and not what I was expecting. The bratwurst was tiny! And dry, and not very flavorful at all. The only flavor I could taste was the kraut. It was such a disappointment. The only upside was the coleslaw. I thought it tasted fresh and light. You could still taste the cabbage, but it also had enough mayo/creaminess to it. 

Overall, I will not be back again. I just haven't had anything that would REALLY bring me back. Nothing I can't find at other places - except naan bread, and I think I'll just save that for Indian food. You guys can have Short Leash, I'll just buy all the ingredients from the store and make my own the next time I'm having a hotdog craving."}
{"text":"Always good! Lots of good choices,the organic chicken dog is my go to. Interesting friendly staff . What's not to like."}
{"text":"I was really surprised! Seen the truck around and decided to try out the restaurant. My dad just recovered from a heart attack so when I saw poutine on the menu I thought, yea I should try that!. Beef hot dog with gravy, cheese curds, and French fries, inside some naan. It was really good! I loved it. The inside of the restaurant is your standard modern hipster look. I like the menu layout, easy to follow and choose. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"My friend and I came into Short Leash on Wednesday night to grab dinner before her tattoo appointment at Golden Rule. We only had about 15 minutes to get our food and eat. We asked if they could make it happen that quick, and they did. We were served by a really nice tall guy with a full beard and tattoos. He made sure that we got our food, our check, and out the door in time to make her 6pm appointment. His service was great, and the food was delicious. I only regret that I didn't have more time to savor my hot dog. I'll definitely be back when I have more time to enjoy!"}
{"text":"We loved this place.  A group from the neighborhood rode our bikes down and were there when they opened for lunch.  We started off with the Scotch Eggs that we all shared and I would highly recommend.  Delicious.  We all tried different hot dogs and all loved them.  I like that many are served on naan bread and others served on quality rolls.  The side I chose with my dog was the cole slaw and it was really good.  It's a mayo based dressing but not heavy.  Good beers and a friendly staff."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good friendly staff and something different is always good. Served on pita bread."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place. Our service was excellent. Waitress was very kind and very patient with our group of 8, 4 adults and 4 kids and none of us had been before. Just looking over the menu takes a while because everything looks good. We started with corn dog bites which were good and then we ordered dogs. I had the bear which was different but in a good way. The house made chips are good too. Everyone loved their food. The brat stuffed pretzel and regular pretzel dogs were good too. The real star at this place are the donuts! We tried a strawberry cheesecake, a root beer float and a chocolate chip cookie dough. All were excellent and I would come here just for the donuts. Add in the uno cards at the table to keep kids (or adults) occupied and the great beer list and you get a great joint I can't wait to go to again."}
{"text":"Sometimes in life you just need a bratwurst stuffed pretzel loaded with sauerkraut, bacon, swiss cheese and some sweet , sweet bavarian mustard to make a lousy day better.. oh and maybe a side of loaded fries and a doughnut to top it off with.  Now this may seem like a bit much for one person to eat, but I promise you, it totally was.  Yet, I could not help myself.  
     The combination of juicy bratwurst absored into a soft, warm pretzel covered in melted cheese and sauerkraut topped with a sweet yet tart bavarian mustard was too much to handle.  It was everything I had been waiting to eat but it left me wanting more.  After finishing it, I immediately regretted not having ordered another dog, but it was ok, because I had ordered some back up items.
     Along with my main, I had an order of the loaded fries which consisted of crispy french fries covered in chilli, cheese, sour cream and japalenos.  The chilli was quite yummy and would have been good even on its own.  I would highly suggest this if you like your fries messy and delicious.  The next victim after the loaded fries was the orange glazed, chopped pistacio covered doughnut.  It was a light, airy, full flavored mess.  The orange glaze was not too sweet where my brain had to shut down due to sugar overload, but it was still upfront enough to let me know, I should only eat one.  The mixture of orange and pistacio was aromatic and very prominent in the taste.  The pistacios themselves gave a great texture, and really added that \"wow\" factor.  
     I really cannot find fault in my meal, it was freaking GOOD and I was completely satisified with it."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, contemporary spot, delicious bloody Mary and mouth watering dogs.  What else can i say?

Came in on a Sunday morning, thought i try the crispy breakfast dog, loved it!  The bar had \"The walking dead\" Marathon on.  They make their bloody Mary with pink sea salt and Okra, i also ordered a side of fried pickles to go.  

loved everything about this place, definitely will be back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Best fried green tomatoes anywhere. Best part is they put them in a salad! 
We have been there 3 times in last 6 months...not impressed...we live in Idaho! this is a must stop for us every time we come to town. this trip we were there less than 1 hour after landing in Phoenix.
What a great menu and fantastic beer selection!
Don't forget the donuts for dessert!
Can't wait till next trip to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Like food from a truck, hate the lines, standing heat and lack of a place to sit, oh yeah and lack of beer? Well then come here as this solves all of those issues. The one issue it still does not solve is: is a hot dog and chips worth $8.50

In a hip urban down town spot which was the easily forgotten tedybertos is Short Leash sit and say, what happens when a food truck graduates to a food storefront.  There are a few bar seats, several 4 person tables and a larger table to accommodate small groups. 

The menu consists of hotdogs with unique toppings server on naan bread, and some other items, and even a few dinner only items. There is beer and even a local little it shop to the side.

I oped for a veggie dog in the seasonal style with a roasted pablano and pumpkin cream. I was skeptical but it worked well. I think the veggie dogs them selves could use a bit more character however.  The chips were home made and quite good, maybe the addition of a seasoned salt or aoli would be nice. 

If you want to flex your hipster muscles and show off to a guest take them here, then cruize the hood on your fixie as there are a few other spots to grab a drink near by."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for the first time on First Friday, so it was quite busy, but that is to be expected. We just got drinks, but perused the food menu as well. They have a wonderful beer selection with lots of IPAs. The bartender was very good and attentive. Their food looks excellent and we are a fan of the food truck, it just strikes me as a little expensive for hot dogs. We will definitely go back to try the food soon though."}
{"text":"Had lunch here the other day. We started with the fried cheese curds. Pretty much like fried mozzarella sticks. Nice spicy dipping sauce.

One of us had the Crispy Dog, which is 2 cheese stuffed wieners fried in corn tortillas, with an avocado cream sauce. Wow, one of the best (and probably most caloric) hot dogs I've ever had. Nice crunch with the tortilla (not at all soggy). Gotta watch out for the cheese/oil squirting out of the hot dogs though!

The other order was for the Oliver dog - a regular hot dog with sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, and 1000 Island dressing, served up in a naan. Actually great concept, as the naan held everything together without tearing.

They have a display of soapbox derby cars - the place hosts adults' soap box derby races every year. Some cars are very creative!

Nice place and would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped here recently for the 2016 Urban Wine Walk event. They had the food truck pulled up to the side of the building with the attached patio. They were organized and they kept the wine chilled well too. I didn't get to try anything more from the menu due to time restrictions but the food I saw coming out looked great. 
The idea of these event is to introduce new people to these places; I really enjoyed the food sample they offered at the event, the Spinach Artichoke Stuffed Pretzel Knots, however, upon reviewing the menu online, I don't see it even listed? Fail. I'd go back to this place just to get more of these - they were so good. Get these on the menu for goodness sake!"}
{"text":"Stopped in towards the end of an awesome date with my girlfriend and got a Bratwurst Stuffed Pretzel and it was absolutely delicious. 

The beer selection was a welcome sight with many regional and local choices (Four Peaks, San Tan). 

Can't wait to come back and get another awesome hot dog! (and a beer!)"}
{"text":"Ok, but not worth the price. The $8.00 I spent for a bratwurst with a few chopped tomato pieces and some sort of sauce, all wrapped in a puffy taco shell, was about double what it was worth. You'd think the bratwurst would be the star of the bunless \"hot dog\", but it was tough - the casing was either really thick or just hard to break through. And, it was pretty tasteless. No repeat visit for me!"}
{"text":"Q. What did the Short Leash dog say when asked about the secret to a great hot dog?

A. \"Naan of your business!\"

These hot dogs are out of this world good. Each one starts with, you guessed it, naan bread, topped with a hot dog, brat or sausage with your choice of any number of creative toppings. You can also get chips or greens on the side.

I stopped by a UYE here last night and was blown away by the crowd. Luckily, we had a table and the service was prompt. I should have tried the special hot dog of the day, but in my hurry, I \"settled\" for the Bear. 

If you haven't heard, the \"Bear\" is a culinary masterpiece containing peanut butter, cracker jack, gouda, bacon and BBQ sauce. The mix of sweet BBQ and peanuts must be tried. Don't just scarf this one down - savor each bite. 

I'll be honest, I liked eating at the restaurant more than the food truck. There is decent seating, you remain unaffected by the elements, and the hot dogs taste better to me. When you're in the area, check out this fantastic spot right around where downtown meets midtown."}
{"text":"Ahhhhhh wasn't super impressed w the hot dogs, pretty bummed actually. Great location + cute spot + enjoyed a cold glass of beer!"}
{"text":"In my opinion the difference between rating Short Leash Hot Dogs 5 stars versus my rating of 4 stars is the price. Your meal costs about $12 when you order a premium dog which comes with a salad or chips and no drink plus tip.

I've had a few items. First of all I am not a corn dog fan but I loved their Corn Dog Bites appetizer for $7. Kudos to Amy H. & Lisa E. for ordering that! Dip it in mustard and you will be very happy.

I've ordered the Bratwurst Stuffed Pretzel which is paired with sauerkraut laced bacon. It's awfully good. But my favorite has to be Sunny. Sunny consists of grilled seasonal fruit, prosciutto, mixed greens, goat cheese, honey & cracked pepper served on naan with a chicken wiener. This was so unbelievably good. I really don't see myself ordering anything besides the Sunny when I visit Short Leash Dogs. Did I mention the side salad? It's very tasty and with the right amount of vinaigrette.

Finally, Let's talk parking. Just park on the street that is North of the restaurant. There is parking next to Short Leash but it fills up by noon."}
{"text":"So I still love short leash but am very disappointed in one thing.

They stopped making the chips in house!:( they were so tasty!! 

They did extend the patio and add more seating which is nice. They're definitely not skimping on the beer can selection.

I've tried the Mac and cheese which is good but nothing to die for. The dogs I love are still the bear, devil dog and aiko. They do a great job with the doughnuts too. I'd just like too see them up their sides game."}
{"text":"Stopped in for first Friday- finally! The atmosphere was great and the staff was very friendly. We sat outside and the patio was really nice. I ordered the Oliver with a brat and fries with green chilies. The fries were COLD. So cold in face that the cheese wasn't melted at all. The green chilies were from a can and the fries appeared to be from a freezer bag. Unimpressed.

The presentation of the dog was great but that was it. The \"brat\" was skinny. The cheese wasn't melted again because as we all know food must be hot to melt the cheese. The menu lead me to believe that there would be a small amount of 1000 Island on the dog and it was drenched. So drenched that it was everywhere. 

The server was very attentive and helpful at first but as the end of the meal approached she disappeared. First Friday is busy and I get that so I stood up to help her with a visual cue. I stood for over 20 minutes and I ended up having to find her myself. Luckily, she was kind and offered to buy my drink for me. 

The atmosphere and cleanliness and kind staff are great but the food is cold and mediocre at best. You can prepare a better dog at home. Owner please reach out because I expected better from an award winning place and would give it another shot if you respond and give me some answers!"}
{"text":"Caught them on an off moment or something..I ordered lime soda, and a lady with a bleu cheese side salad. Received lemon, and a lady with a vinaigrette side salad..but that didn't matter, because I never got a fork to eat it with. By the time she came back, I had eaten the average hot dog concoction, built on naan, with indecipherable flavors that didn't taste like the description. I mentioned the dressing error, and no fork thing and asked for only the check. She runs in the back trying to remake the salad, or repair the error, which took another 5mins. I throw $15 on the table, hoping that will cover it, and start to leave..she comes out with salad in hand, still no check..maybe a food truck is the best bet."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant I used to follow the food truck. Everything here is so unique. Its definitely one of a kind"}
{"text":"Nice work reinventing the hot dog, especially for a vegetarian. I've visited the food truck several times and decided to try Sit...Stay. It did not disappoint. I was craving the veggie lady so bad, so I begged my husband and we made the 25 minute trip downtown to get a fix. 

Simple casual decor with a nice bar - seating for 8-10 and several tables, including a community table. 

Started with the fried pickles, nomnomnom, and some local brews. 

I ordered the veggie lady - such a simple thing, but I am seriously addicted. My husband ordered the spicy beer hot devil dog with a side of mango chutney and he loved it too. 

Open a north Scottsdale location, maybe a quick window service style in The Quarter?"}
{"text":"Another episode of Paul and Lynettes Adventures Around the World!

 Such a great place. Great vibes and even better food. I read before we arrived that if you weren't a hotdog fan before, this place will change you...and they were right. 

The \"bear\" and the chili dog were on today's order. We added some insanely amazing fried pickles and jalape√±o poppers. Omg it was all so good. Definitely worth a shot. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good eats. Great kids menu, gourmet hot dogs (all beef, bratwurst, chicken, and vegan) and a huge selection of canned brews with 7 to 8 draft beers on tap. Foosball table a huge hit with kids and adults."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today and as per usual Short Leash delivered.

I had the currywurst Oktoberfest special which was a red curry (think curry ketchup) sauce, chopped onion rings, currywurst (i think might have been knockwurst), served on top of nan bread. It was really good and every bite was flavor packed.

I also had a side salad which had a really tasty dressing but might have been a bit too much of it on it.

I want to come back again and try some of the apps and beers they have on tap. Sadly I went during lunch on a work day so I couldn't have any drinks (yes all of you who know me and are rolling your eyes I do know how to pass up a beer)."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of this place since it was just a hot dog food truck and have been happily eating here while watching them expand to 2 different locations ever since. 
It' s hard to pick one favorite because they are all so tasty and each fulfills a different \"food\" mood. 

I love coming here before seeing a game at the Diamondbacks stadium or grabbing a drink and some food on a First Friday night. Tasty food, cold beer and feel good vibes.

Can't get better than this!"}
{"text":"Had the Bear dog and a chocolate porter.   Not only was the dog excellent, but they have a surprisingly good craft beer selection.  I will be back. Plus I caught 9 Pokemon there while eating my lunch."}
{"text":"If you are downtown, this place is worth checking out. There are different options when it comes to the hot dog. You can order all beef, chicken, bratwurst, or regular hot dogs. Be adventurous and try something new. 

They also have beer, wine, donuts, and coffee."}
{"text":"I've always loved this food truck! My husband and I were so excited that they opened a brick and mortar location so now we always know where to find them. 

Our first visit was great - cute industrial looking place peppered with their dog theme, same friendly service, same delicious gourmet dogs. They offer incredible combinations or build-your-own gourmet hot dogs, wrapped in warm naan. We're vegetarians and the veggies dogs are delicious and available with any toppings.  This has always a favorite, and the new place has beer and wine, to boot :-)"}
{"text":"Great quality hotdogs! The unique toppings they use will make you question ever settling for ketchup and mustard again!"}
{"text":"I was worried that food truck taste would be lost by transferring to a restaurant but it didn't!  And the menu expansion is amazing!"}
{"text":"Very cute and surrounded by awesome art and scenery. Loved the many options offered :)"}
{"text":"We got the crispy dog and the bear... Both were good, the crispy dog was a bit plain.  All the fixings on the bear actually worked pretty well... The standout however were the fried cheese curds... They were excellent. Service was prompt, music, good but a but loud... Must be because I am old."}
{"text":"I came to Short Leash with my boyfriend on Friday night. We had been before, but only for the beer, as part of the Ale Trail months ago. This time, we already had a few beers in us but were stoked to try some hot dogs. Short Leash did not disappoint!

As mentioned by other Yelpers, the vegetarian dog isn't spectacular--however, I am always just happy that there IS a vegetarian option, and that it's available as any menu item. So nice! I had the Lady, which our server recommended, and it was so delicious. Those deep-fried pickles really get me, you know? My boyfriend had the Mac Daddy, and he couldn't stop talking about it. Seriously, the next morning he was still telling me about it and I kept having to remind him that I was there. 

Overall, awesome food, awesome beer, AWESOME service. I left a note for our server, Amanda, and after the large Chainbreaker I had, I think it read like a love note; hopefully I didn't scare her, because we will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"I think it might be puppy love! 

The fried green tomato stack is the kind of dish I'll start to crave. There are enough elements like corn, avocado, and tomato that I can convince myself that it is healthy even though I'm eating something deep fried with bacon and a blue cheese dressing. 

Holy crap, I just don't care! 

I'll spend my days dreaming about you until we can meet once more. The atmosphere is inviting and clean and don't forget to check out the wall of furry friends that's by the bathrooms before you leave."}
{"text":"I don't have any pictures because it got scarffed down so fast. It's THAT delicious!! Definitely have the strawberry cheese cake donut with lots of strawberry and whipped cream without request. I tried the Scottish eggs here and they're better than the ones at the Irish Festival around St Patrick's Day. 

The slow cooked bratwurst pretzel has an ample amount of the classic souracraut and cheese on it but the bread is a little bit too chewy. My boyfriend had double bacon wrapped cheese stuffed brauts with German coleslaw is HELLA yummy! 

Shout out to our server, MARY, who also gave awesome service and chill attitude at Rice Paper! :D"}
{"text":"We stopped here for the first time after a hike. We had ordered the chilli cheese hotdog, Miko beer hot hotdog, fried pickles and Mac n cheese. I will start by saying the actual hotdogs themselves were tasty but nothing spectacular. However, the chilli that was on top of the hotdog had no flavor and tasted like it was out of a can. The Miko hotdog was good but all didn't provide any flavor. The fried pickles were sweet and the breading was hardly on them though when brought out. Furthermore, the mac n cheese was horrible and lacked flavor all together and was NOT cheesy. Certainly will not be going back here."}
{"text":"Don't know why I've waited so long to review this place, these people, this concept! We love Short Leash! We have been visiting Short Leash since it first opened! We discovered the food truck and have been visiting ever since! We absolutely LOVE the restaurant though & were so excited for its opening! 

The food is all good, but The Sunny is our favorite! We also love the Fried Green Tomatoes, The Pimento Dip & the Pig in the Blanket! YUM! I'm getting hungry just writing this review! Be sure to visit the Pie Hole next door too as Tanya's pies are fantastic! We love the Chocolate Eclair!!

Support local & definitely try this place! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Awesome donuts. Stopped by this am, to break my 14-hour overnight fast, and picked an old fashioned and a triple chocolate. Both cake. Wouldn't call them massive in size, but substantial and weighty.

The old fashion was dense, tender, wonderful mouthfeel and texture, and the white creme into which the top was dipped was a heavenly, creamy, gooey coating. A meal in itself, and I can usually eat several standard donuts at a sitting.

It took a couple hours to feel ready to eat the triple chocolate. Dense yet. Tender, chocolate-ish cake, rich chocolate frosting, and garnished in mini chocolate chips. Another great tasting donut!

Both are calorie bombs, and both carry the richness of the cooking oil. A single donut seems to be completely filling, both from the stomach and mouth points of view, making them unlike any donuts I've ever had. Maybe these are like donuts that my mythical home-made-donut-making grandma would have made!!!

These are awesome donuts, well worth eating. However, they come at a significant cost delta over plain-old Dunkin' Donuts type donuts. The pair cost $4.84 including any taxes. That's a lot of money for what until now I'd considered to not be worth that kind of money. After considering that, perhaps it's time I contemplate that $2.42 for a morning meal isn't a bad thing, rather than thinking of these as \"just\" donuts. There is no comparison when it comes to taste and mouthfeel."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review in the midst of the happy food coma this restaurant put me in. I was so excited when I found out that Short Leash was going to be unleashed to become their own stand along restaurant! This means that I don't have to chase a truck to get my Short Leash fix anymore! We rushed here the first available moment and tonight was the night. Knowing that Short Leash has a cult following and others would probably be lining up to eat here too, we came early at about 5:30. I'm so glad we did because by the time we left at 6:45pm, there was a wait almost out the door! 

The hot dogs are exactly what you would expect: delicious Schreiner's sausages sandwiched between fresh Naan with a variety of different delicious ingredients on top. There are several unique hot dog entrees to choose from and you can also build your own dog. We started with the corn dog bites which come on skewer sticks and are accompanied by a ranch and a spicy sauce. The corn dogs are amazing; freshly made corn dog batter and cheese infused sausage. For my entree, I decided to go with a class Short Leash special, the Sunny which is a chicken sausage with grilled fruit, goat cheese, prosciutto and arugula. It's one of my favorite hot dogs and the perfect combination of ingredients. Besides the hot dogs that made them the local celebrities they are today, this restaurant has some new additions to the menu including salads and sliders. They also have beer on tap so you can have a beer with your dog! 

As for the environment, it's very neighborhood friendly. Everyone is encouraged to be friends while they eat and this is reflected by the communal tables. Be prepared to dine with a couple strangers (who might become new-found friends!) if you come during peak hours. If you don't feel like taking the chance to have to dine at a communal table, then I suggest that you eat at the bar. It's simple sophistication inside with a cool feel to it. Brad and Kat's friendly personality comes to life as Brad welcomes you inside while Kat cooks up a storm in the back. 

I am so happy that this successful food truck has turned into an adorable restaurant. Their food, service and charm has rolled over nicely into their new restaurant! I will happily return again soon to get my Short Leash fix. 

***** 
After dining on our hot dogs, we headed next door for a piece of pie from another food truck success story, Mamma Toledo who opened up The Pie Hole next door. Look for that review coming up next!"}
{"text":"Love this place? I've been a couple times now. First time I went with a few friends after brunch at Matt's Big Breakfast right down the street. We initially walked in just to take a look at what they had while we were waiting and decided, upon seeing the display, that we would be back for desserts.

We split a few donuts - bourbon cream, peanut butter chocolate, and coffee donut. They were all so delicious, reasonably priced for fancy donuts. And the place itself has a great vibe, very chill and laid back. We even played a round of Uno while we ate.

The next time, I got a maple bacon donut and it was just as tasty as the other ones I had had. I must have been hungry, because I also ordered a hotdog and a scoop of banana and dark chocolate gelato. Got a can of beer too because it was happy hour. Already looking forward to my next time back!"}
{"text":"Omg this place is amazing and who would've thought that replacing buns with naan would be so amazing. I customized my dog and both it and my fries came out piping hot. I'm excited to try new flavors but definitely a go to for gourmet dogs."}
{"text":"Only 4 stars because often times lately the hot dogs aren't that warm. I understand that due to new locations, the owners aren't usually around. I would encourage them to do some quality control checks. The luke-warm food thing is repeatedly a problem for me here."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from alot of friends saying it was great. Had to try it and yes....it's FANTASTIC!  I had the igby. If you like bbq and blue cheese, it's for you! Hot dogs on Nan bread. Soo good! Also grabbed some of the best fried pickles and a grape soda. Nothing short of awesomeness here. Go give it a try!!!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: A smaller sized restaurant right smack in Roosevelt restaurant scene has 12 tables inside with a long bar, 12 tables outside in their shaded patio via the help of some Palo Verde trees. The vibe here is laid back and whimsical. Lots of hot dog inspired art work on the walls. 

Food: Gourmet hotdogs? Yes, and they're wonderful. First let's start with the protein, all their meat is nitrate free...YEAH for healthy. You can pick from beef, brat, chicken or veggie dogs. The buns are naan patties. The ingredient list is killer. Just take a breath and jump in. The Bear had peanutbutter, gouda and crackerjacks...somehow it just works and I totally dig it. The sunny has fried peaches or pear, prosciutto arugula and honey, equally delicious.

Price/Service: 8/9 bucks for agourmet hotdog is reasonable. Service is always great.

Overall: Gourmet hotdogs with a lot of healthy options, what's not to like!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! The designer of this shop is really creative.. this shop matches perfectly with the downtown Phoenix look and vibe! 

Get the Bear hot dog.. peanut butter, bbq sauce, gouda, bacon, kettle corn.. So bomb!"}
{"text":"Been here several times and try to order something different each time. This time was the bratwurst with saurkraut with sweet Bavarian mustard, with jalapeno poppers. The poppers are fresh and very tasty. Bratwurst is served in nan rather than a bun. Delicious. They let you sample the draft drinks which is nice. Super nice wait staff and an all around great experience"}
{"text":"Try their fried pickles, they are really quite yummy. Sausages on a naan, which is a neat concept. I have not tried the Chicago dog yet since I'm sure it's heresy to have one on anything but a poppyseed bun 
Decent beer selection and a great addition to Roosevelt row"}
{"text":"Wow!! This place was so freaking good. I got the Bear with a spicy beer hot dog, and my bf got the Lady, also with a spicy beer dog. We also split Scotch eggs (their homemade sauce was GREAT), jalape√±o poppers and crispy dogs. All of the food was damn good. I didn't know my dog had bbq sauce on it so I was surprised when it came out but WOW was it a great combination!! The naan bread is different, not too heavy and dry, perfect. The donuts in the case looked impressive too, we'll probably try them next time. The staff was all really friendly and attentive even though the place was packed. We will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"The bartender I had here was pretty dang cool.  It's so nice to talk to a female who knows about beer.  I sat at the bar and chatted with her and another server that was doing silverware at the bar, they were so friendly.

I can't remember what I had but I know it was delicious and that I should go back for more especially because it was so reasonably priced. The decor is pretty cool. Small and laid back.  Great addition to the downtown good scene!"}
{"text":"WOW!! Absolutely blown away with how good these hotdogs are. I'm from Chicago and have been a frequent visitor to SuperDawg, Weiner Circle, and plenty of other great  Chicago hotdog destinations throughout my glutton filled life. Short Leash Hot Dogs blows away these famous Chicago places. 

I go back to visit Chicago a couple times a year and it won't be as exciting to go back now because half the reason I like going back to visit is so I can stuff my face with Chicago style hotdogs, and I'll be disappointed eating there now because Short Leash is so good.

I also enjoyed the little hipster bar set up that they have and also have a good beer selection.

Any person who gives this place less than 5 stars should be jailed in Tent City a bit longer than first time DUI offenders. And should also be forced to register as a food offender for the rest of their lives, so the public knows exactly where you food deviants live."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the customer service with this place. I ordered the large fries that came with beans, cheese, chili and the flavors are very bold. The corn dogs were a bit salty though and the waitress was extremely nice and recommended a hot dog that was on the huffington post's must eats before you die. Everything came fairly quickly. Definitely one of the must eats if you are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is full of delicious combinations of joy and hot dogs. Fried pickles were other worldly. Great service!"}
{"text":"The grossest, most weirdest, most delicious hotdog you'll ever try... Find it here in the form of the Bear. Peanut butter, gouda, bacon, bbq sauce and CRACKER JACKS on top of a hot dog (all beef is my fav), rolled up in a piece of fresh naan bread. I didn't believe I'd like it until I tried it myself. I dare you to order the Bear, and if you hate it, call me and I'll eat it and buy you something else. I'm sure the other unique options are just as delicious as the Bear, but I can't stay away. That being said, Short Leash Hotdogs isn't a restaurant you can frequent every day or every week. Too rich, too many calories.

I've yet to try their donuts, simply because they are always sold out when I come in. They've got a breakfast menu so I'll have to stop by earlier in the day. Cocktail selection is intriguing, and I'm looking forward to the day I'll have time to grab a drink here.

Despite being downtown, there is ample parking adjacent to the building. Service is quick and friendly. Definitely worth your time!!

5/5 delicious eats
5/5 service
0/5 no donuts available late in the day :("}
{"text":"Great time here! Loved the hot dogs! We got he crispy dog and something else! It was all so good! Only downside is that it was SO hot in the building. 

Other than that, great food!"}
{"text":"It shames me to admit this but I only just recently discovered Short Leash dogs but I am thrilled that they now have a permanent spot in downtown. These guys truly represent what local business is all about: they serve up a unique, high quality product and it is obvious that they love what they do.

The unique, high-quality product to which I refer is of course hot dogs. But not just hot dogs. They have brats and a choice of different wieners.

I prefer to build my own so I went with the all beef wiener with sauteed onions, mushrooms, bacon, tomato, bleu cheese and chipotle mayo served on flat bread. SO good. They also have their own creations which are pretty unique and creative.

What's nice about Sit....Stay is that they have a nice little bar with draft beer and wine. They also have an expanded menu that includes appetizers and salads as well as some entrees like Polka Dot casserole and Pig in a Blanket which both sound awesome.

The people that work here are all super nice as well and that is what makes me happy to spend my money here and support this business. Definitely worth checking out and supporting. They are close to where I work so I see myself in here often for lunch."}
{"text":"Dear short leash, 

I am a supporter of all things short leash.  I bring everyone that comes to town to devour your awesome dogs...and the corn dog bites with a beer are the best afternoon snack on a hot day.

However, I cannot support the donut effort.  The donuts have to go back from whence they came.  Good idea. Good flavor combos. Bad execution.  If any, work on the dough part of the nut.  It just doesn't taste right.  Toppings aren't bad, at least the orange one that I tried...but alas did not finish, as the rest of it (all that was not topping) just couldn't happen in my world.  Please work on the dough and try again. I really want to support the donut.  It is chewy and odd and sour-ish and leaves a horrid aftertaste on the buds,  and just all-around not very nice...kind of like weird yeasty, sourdough bread dough that had been deep fried. 

In the mean time, I will stick you your amazing dogs."}
{"text":"Not bad.  It does get rid of two cravings.  Flat bread and hotdogs.  lol  Service was great and it seems they do a lot for the community."}
{"text":"Serina was fantastic!! She was an absolute delight and took the time to walk me through my first time here. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here with a friend today during the Art Detour. The place was full but they did something really nice and they would put 2 groups of 2 on a 6-top to get us seated faster. It worked out great. Once we were seated, the service was super slow. I think we waited 15 minutes before someone came to take our order. The food was five stars but the slow service took them down a notch.

I had the breakfast scramble and oh my goodness it was good - eggs, sausage, cheese, peppers, green chilis, and mushrooms on naan. It was delicious.  My friend had the Igby dog - vegetarian - her favorite. She also had a ginger ale and said it was really good.

I'll be back, but probably not when it's so busy."}
{"text":"Fantastic! I fell in love with Short Leash as a food truck, and love the brick n mortar location even more so. Great for the whole family, everyone gets what they like, vegi-dog for me, and plenty of options for kids. Killer local craft beer selection too! Love it!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! Their hotdogs are served on naan bread rather than the traditional bun which is delicious! I got the Aiko with chicken. It was very good. I definitely want to come back to try other items on their menu and get some drinks that are on their daily specials."}
{"text":"Pretty cool idea, lots of different options on the menu to choose from. The beer selection was decent for canned beers but the only had one brand on tap and the one I wanted was out.
 (typical)

We ordered the loaded fries as an appetizer and each got a hot dog. The dogs actually came out first which is super annoying, but what was more concerning than getting the main course before the app was the fact that the food came out in a matter of minutes. 

The brats, dogs, and fries have to be sitting back there already cooked and ready to go. I'm all for quick service, but I'd much rather wait and have freshly made food. 

I got the Bratwurst Stuffed Pretzel. Although it looks huge, its basically 90% bun. The inner bratwurst was very thin. I also would have enjoyed it a bit more if the swiss cheese on top was melted. The pretzel bun was delicious and overall the sandwich was good.

I would come back again but I'd be lying if i said I wasn't a bit disappointed after reading all the amazing review on here."}
{"text":"Short Leash has been through a lot of changes and renovations over the last 4+ years, but it has remained a mainstay in my rotation of downtown Phoenix eateries. 

The menu is short but sweet, giving you unique combinations to top your choice of dog. The Bear can't be more praised--where else do you find cracker jacks and peanut butter AND bacon on a hot dog? If this isn't up your alley, other options include mac & cheese or seasonal fruits. There are dozens of combinations between your choice of frank, bread, and menu or build-your-own toppings. 

Local beers also reign supreme here. The drafts encompass a wide range of brew types, and the fridge is always full of cans. 

Finally, the donuts tempt you with a two-shelf selection at the end of the bar. Take one to go so you can have a bit of Short Leash wherever you head next."}
{"text":"Tasty & Fun.  Service was friendly and great!  I tried the Lady - fried pickles, spicy cream cheese and grilled onions on your choice of dog wrapped in flat bread.  Oh, the fried pickles are sweet, not savory.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is on point. The staff is really friendly and warm. You feel like your part of the short leash family when you're there. My favorite dog is the bear with a veggie dog. So good! I also love that they have great beers on tap! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"For someone from Chicago to give 5 stars to a non-Chicago hot dog place, you should probably go.  It's really the new Hot Doug's."}
{"text":"We come here quite regularly and love it but, but today my husband felt like a kid finding out that Santa isn't real and not only that, but a smelly guy in bad suit who had a few too many drinks. We are giant fans of the Bear, but today there was so much bacon and bbq sauce that it ruined the experience. Usually that wierd but wonderful mixture of peanut butter, gouda, bbq, bacon, cracker jacks, and spicy dog leave your taste buds awed, inspired, and feeling confused, however today they were crushed by the weight of the salty bacon. No finesse to the flavor combos, just a mass of bacon which when scraped off 2 bites in amounted to more than the hot dog and peanut butter combined! So we will come back but not sure if my husband will dare his beloved Bear again, at least not without saying light on the bacon. He also misses the crumbling of the cracker jacks from years past.

My crispy dogs were delicious though, as well as the fried pickles. The jalapeno poppers were tough though."}
{"text":"Happened upon this place when walking down Roosevelt Row. Clean, quick, and reasonably priced. Half of the mini corndogs were filled with cheese."}
{"text":"Gather round children of all ages, for I have a tale. A tale of a wondrous magical place, full of sausages, bratwurst, red hots, bacon, donuts and many many more amazing tasty things. This place my friends, is Short Leash Hot Dogs on Roosevelt.
Don't let the word \"hot dog\" turn you off, as these aren't those amalgamation of animal parts you'd find in your local grocer's fridge section. These dogs are simply amazing marvels of meat perfection.
With many signature dogs and premium dog creations, such as my favorite, \"The Bear\" which is  peanut butter, smoked gouda, bacon, bbq sauce & cracker jacks on your choice of dog, I choose Bratwurst. My second favorite would be the \"Devil Dog\" which consists of roasted red peppers, green chiles, sriracha, saut√©ed onions, cheddar cheese & jalape√±os and I love it on the spicy beer hot.
They have vegetarian dogs as well for you not so into eating our animal friends out there kinda people. Sides, salads, appetizers, dinners all ranging from scotch eggs to polka for casserole to a bevy of delicious sweet balls of donuty goodness ( yes it's a word, I have spoken and thus it is so )
You can even create your own dogs, with a great array of toppings. 
Today is had the bratwurst topped with pinto beans, raw onions, sriracha, bleu cheese, jalape√±os and bacon. BTW, ordering with bacon, means bacon wrapped ;) Which is IMHO oh so much better *wipes drool from mouth*
So, my friends I tell you to drop what you're doing now and head on over to Short Leash and have most delicious dogs you'll ever eat, a drink of your choosing ( such good local brewers have their alcohol available here ) and finish it with an awesome dessert that'll leave you wanting more. I know I want more now and may have to stop in for seconds ;)"}
{"text":"Our hot dogs were nothing special. I LOVE hot dogs so I always try every place that I can. When we got here the guy asked us if we minded sitting \"community style\" which is a table that seats 4 and then we sit shoulder-to-shoulder with two other strangers like on the subway. That's totally weird but okay. I got a Moki dog and the dog itself was just a normal boiled-in-water hot dog. They took some barely cooked naan and some shredded cheese and beans and rolled them together and that was what I got for $8. I can make that at my house in a few minutes without much effort. Wife got a pig in a blanket that was a deep fried kielbasa that tasted like it was heavily rolled in sage. We didn't even finish that. Fried pickles were awesome. Our tab was the best joke of the night-$30 for two hot dogs and some fried pickles and a \"special\" root beer. They ran out of the good kind so he brought me a bottle of IBC and hoped I wouldn't notice the difference.

If you're a hipster looking for a good atmosphere with other androgynous and edgy hipsters then this is your spot. You can wash your hot dog down with a $7 small coffee from Luxe a few blocks away and then go home and wonder where all your money goes. I'm poor and not cool so $30 for two hot dogs and a root beer and fried pickles was not a good value in my opinion. If the food was good then I wouldn't worry about it but the food here is nothing special. If you want a good hot dog go to the new El Guero Canelo in Phoenix or Morenos. They have Sonoran dogs for $2.50 each that taste amazing! Even Portillos will give you a HUGE meal for $30."}
{"text":"Great place to get a hot dog that isn't boring. Hot dogs come on warm naan bread and you'll be glad a standard bun isn't used. They have a lot of free toppings to choose from and even dogs with clever names for interesting combinations.

Their selection of dogs is diverse and I love the spicy one. If you just want a normal hot dog with ketchup, although it will be tasty you may want to take your simple tastes elsewhere. The free toppings are basically included in the price of your hot dog.

Great place and very friendly owners."}
{"text":"Yum the vegan hot dog was a fabulous treat from a food truck! The fried pickles were the best I have tasted!"}
{"text":"Just can't wrap myself around this place. I tried the truck and the restaurant a total of 4 times.....no buns, no like. It's a creative idea to use a tortilla-like pocket for the dogs but it just doesn't cut it. I'd rather eat street dogs.

Service last time was poor. Waitress seemed to be inconvenienced."}
{"text":"We had such a nice dinner here with my parents. The patio was lovely and the pickle chips were amazing! The hot dogs came wrapped in naan rather than a bun which was pretty rad. If you're looking for a reasonably priced fun local restaurant, give this place a try."}
{"text":"overpriced. $10 for poutine. and it was mostly fries. barely any gravy and even less cheese. $9 for a hot dog... didn't include fries or a drink. those were separate. $30 for poutine, one hot dog, fries, and 2 sodas. not worth it. the only thing worth going for is the wall of dog photos by the bathroom."}
{"text":"Food: ordered a basic chili cheese dog with all the works. They had a good amount of options but I wanted to be safe just in case. Overall the food was just ok. I've had better hot dogs at a cheaper place. However their ingredients were very fresh.

Location: nice location... loved that they had uno games on the table to play while you wait for your food.

Time: time waiting was not long -- about 7 mins after ordering. Food was fresh and hot."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Short Leash Hot Dogs ever since I found there food truck in alley off Camelback & Central, I'm not even someone who likes hot dogs, but these guys, man they made some great dogs!

I won't even lie when I do make it to Short Leash it's because I already know what I want. My favorite starters are the fried pickles, beer battered & deep fried slices of deliciousness and some of the best jalapeno poppers I have had in a long time, fresh jalapenos stuffed with smoked gouda and pimento cheese, battered and fried, Oh sweet lawd! These are some great tasting poppers!  

My top 2 favorite hot dogs are The Bear and The Moki, both all beef dogs and on naan bread. The Bear has peanut butter, smoked gouda, bacon, bbq sauce and cracker jacks and the Moki has roasted green chili, saut√©ed onions, tomatoes, pinto beans, chedder cheese and some mayo. I'm sure if you are reading that you're thinking um no, but no really give it a try! Both of these dogs are amazing! The Bear is my favorite and The Moki to me like a fancy chili dog.

If you haven't been to Short Leash, you should stop by and give them try!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes because I love their corn dog bites from the food truck.  The location and feel of the place is nice.  The service was slow and you had to ask for refills.  I got the custom build your dog: Bratwurst, cheese, and mayo with chips.  It was disappointing to be just OK.  I have had better Bratwurst.  Maybe I should have gotten the Bratwurst Stuffed Pretzel, it got great reviews."}
{"text":"Back in the day [about a month ago] when they were 'just' a food truck they were my Wednesday dinner at the downtown Farmers Market and alternate Fridays at the empty lot on Camelback.

Now I have to bike all the way 2 blocks north to their sit down restaurant to get my Wednesday fix.

Worth it. The only place I eat hot dogs in America.

What's up with the empty lot now? Who knows - who cares"}
{"text":"Really good hotdog! A new look to a regular meal. The Cuban hotdog is really good and the service was decent. It is expensive though. Would go again."}
{"text":"I know this is a popular spot.  I know the owners are down to earth, friendly and nice people.  I even like their food even though none of it qualifies for food good for your heart.  In fact, you could even claim that I love their food cause well, I just love hot dogs . . . it's one thing that's hard for me to 100% delete from my diet.  I cheat with hot dogs the way others cheat with their cigarettes.  Sometimes I'll give my husband an excuse, get in my car then drive to get an ever so yummy hot dog.  I'm just kidding, well, almost.  

I also love creativity and you have to admit these guys are creative~ infusing all kinds of flavours and combinations to their doggies and tasting all so yum, yum. 

Speaking of doggies.  This brings me to the reason of 3 stars.  The night we were there, all Elite Yelpers mind you so I mean, you know, we're going to be writing reviews, we're having a good time, tasting practically everything on the menu, including the fried green tomato salad (which is delectable and you get your veggies in).

Here we were, enjoy ourselves when I looked over at another table and there is a LARGE dog sitting by the table, lapping it up, doing I don't know what and well, this dog was not a seeing dog.  Just a regular, friendly, happy dog. And don't get me wrong, I like dogs . . . just not INSIDE the restaurant of where I'm eating.  I could be wrong but I think having this dog inside the restaurant violated several health code violations.

If having dogs inside restaurants is a new trend I'm NOT aware of and it complies with Photenix health code for restaurants, send me a message and I will update this review.  Otherwise, please keep the doggies on the plate, not inside the restaurant where it will cause me to question the cleanliness of the place!"}
{"text":"Great hot dogs with interesting toppings and even better doughnuts. The quality of the hot dog is bar none and you get Naan bread instead of a bun which works great"}
{"text":"Everytime I come here I affirm what I already know, simply the best damn hotdog join in phx!!!
Such great taste combos keep my buds entertained even after the 12th time this year"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here with family after morning at the Childrens Museum. Food was great and service was good as well. Great place to take kids of all ages."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place but overall the meal was pretty disappointing. My boyfriend and I split an order of jalapeno poppers which were okay. I got a pretzel dog which had way too much pretzel and not enough dog. Overall the \"eh\",\" no desire to go back."}
{"text":"Shut the front door!  We tried three different dogs, fried pickles and the fried tomatoes salad.  Holy s$&t they were good.  My favorite was the bratwurst stuffed pretzel but I don't think you can wrong with anything.  The \"bear\" was crazy original and delicious."}
{"text":"Great local spot!  From a wonderful food truck comes a wonderful sit down.  I loved the beer selection and the food is excellent.  I suggest the fried pickles or corn dog to start off with, after that it's up to you.  

Thank you Short Leash for being an example of the Phoenix pride, you are models of a great business plan and community leaders."}
{"text":"The food is DELICIOUS. Very simple, yet unique and the flavors are great!

I have been here 4-5 times and the food is always good, but the service is always VERY iffy. 

Many times, being seated has been an ordeal, the service is slow, they haven't had the soda I want, the wait staff is extremely awkward and they seem really anti-social. They are not overly welcoming.

I always come back for the food, but my biggest and most recurring complaint is the service. Considering the food combinations are based off of different hot dogs and sausages, in my opinion it takes a little longer than I think it should, especially with the service itself. 

Otherwise, it's a great new, unique place with great food. I have never tried the food truck, but have never heard any complaints about the food. 

They also have a good selection of \"hipster\" drinks, local products and alcohol, if I remember correctly."}
{"text":"Great food, terrible customer service. Felt like I was being treated like a child. I asked my boyfriend if he wanted a beer and before he could ever respond we were hassled for our ID's, almost like the guy didn't think we were old enough. I was just taken aback considering that we hadn't even ordered yet and the guy was so abrupt. The hotdog was out of this world and I loved the setting (and beer was great) the but the guy made me feel so uncomfortable I don't think I'll be back. Bummer."}
{"text":"Maybe I live under a rock, but I had no idea that Roosevelt had so many great restaurants/shops.  We were hungry after a DBacks, game so we stopped in here for a bite and a drink.  It was about an hour until closing, so the place was quite empty.  We sat at the bar, and my hubby ordered a craft beer that even he had never heard of, and I got a cabernet on tap.  I love the tap wine selection; 4 different wines.  There are also 4 craft beer selections.  We ordered the Moki, which was a delectable mix of beans, tomato, mayo, cheese, and a few other yummy items on a bratwurst, all enveloped by the best \"bun\" I have ever eaten around a hot dog.  It was more like a thick tortilla.   It was warm and soft and pillowy.   The chips that came with it tasted like they had just been made in house.  You better believe that this won't be our last trip to Short Leash!"}
{"text":"Yes! Everything a great restaurant should be. Clean clean clean, friendly, efficient, delicious and charming. You get the sense the owners take true pride in providing a welcoming neighborhood establishment in which every inch appears thoughtfully planned out; from the custom logos on the fans to the bar and bathroom areas. Check it out and take note Valley business owners!"}
{"text":"Place is very modern and inviting. The devil dog with a brat was amazing! It's delivered on a pita flat which was also very tasty. Jalepenos and peppers mixed with the cheese was almost too good. Service was prompt and friendly. Tea was fresh, firing on all cylinders. If you find yourself downtown or on Roosevelt Row, stop in. Oh, and the price is WAY too low, I expected my meal to be at least 20, nope 9 bucks. The tip I'm sure made up for it."}
{"text":"Could've sworn I wrote a review for this place. It's pretty neat, it's all wrapped around hotdogs so their menus a bit short but the items they offer are pretty legit. They also serve my favorite root beer of all time, Sprecher from Wisconsin. It's a fun environment so bring your friends and see what kind of fancy hotdogs you like!"}
{"text":"I've been to the truck before, but never inside the purple building next to the Phoenix Jazz hotspot The Nash. I had a sort of vegetarian breakfast with the green chile cheese grits, the home fries and an egg. 

The meal was great, well-cooked and just greasy-spoon enough for me to enjoy without feeling like I was about to birth some other-worldly creature. The decorations inside are cool, one might call them industrialized-modern like many of the other new spots popping up around the downtown area. I'm fine with that. 

They also had Chainbreaker from Deschutes Brewery on tap, big plus in my book. It was clean and well-lit. Nothing really out of the ordinary as far as hot dogs go, it's worth mentioning that you can get anything you might get on the truck here, as well as a bevy of other options that aren't available on the truck. Definitely worth a try for lunch or maybe a super-casual dinner."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!

Ordered through ubereats and was excite to  receive the delivery. It was delicious I like how the use a pita type of bread.  I ordered the Devil dog with a spicy beer hot protein. Would definitely eat from here again, next time I will try the Frito pie."}
{"text":"This place is crazy. But the dogs are A+, the beer selection is excellent and the service was friendly. If we lived in Phoenix, we'd be regulars."}
{"text":"The good was delicious, it's a very retro area, small location, mellow atmosphere. They also have a little doughnut bar! It was a little overpriced for a hotdog, but we'll worth it! It's definitely a place to revisit."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place ever since I visited their booth at the Devoured Food and Wine Festival. After a busy afternoon, a girlfriend and I decided to go by for lunch today. So glad we did! When we came by the place was empty, and we got immediate service. Our server was very nice and made sure to point out the featured hotdog for the day, which was an Italian sausage with bolognese sauce . We ordered one, as well as the Oliver to share. So good! It was easy enough to split each hotdog for sharing, and we each got the delicious chips. We both also enjoyed the atmosphere and friendly staff. My only complaint was the sangria, which was good, but $8 for a very small glass. 

Overall, this was a great place to eat and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Went in with my friends today, it was 110 degrees outside and was looking for some beer to cool it down - it didn't live up to the expectations. We had a look for a table which was closest to the Fan to get some good air. 

The food was good but not great , the menu had all the interesting keywords (jalape√±o, chipotle , pickles , bell peppers ) but lacked Flavours."}
{"text":"I wasn't particularly impressed. Food wasn't bad, but it also wasn't super great.

My friends both got the bratwurst stuffed pretzel which tasted good. Both agreed they would have liked it more if the cheese were melted. I got the Sunny (and was SUPER excited bc it hits pretty much all my food buzz words - prosciutto, arugula, pear!?!?! Goat cheese!?!?!?!? Does life get any better?). Anyways I was a little disappointed bc the naan was far bigger than the toppings filled in so it seemed like I wasn't eating very much. The flavors were good, but I did feel it was a better hot dog conceptually than in practice.

We also split the fries - poutine style. I do have to pipe in that I'm from Montreal so I like my poutine. This isn't what I would call \"poutine\" but rather just fries with some gravy & cheese on top (not cheese curds). They didn't taste bad whatsoever, but don't go in with the expectation of getting something spectacularly poutine-like! It's just a topping here.

I'm actually wondering if I had done this place wrong - maybe this is more of a day time place? Maybe there should be more dogs around? Maybe it's more of a food truck thing? Overall, I wasn't impressed and wouldn't come all the way back to Phoenix (esp for a $7.50 hot dog). If I saw a food truck around wherever I was though, I would consider stopping by!"}
{"text":"While waiting for the Lunar New Year festival to open at Hance Park, J and I scoured the vicinity for some breakfast. We saw a sandwich board advertising breakfast, so we decided to stop in.
The decor is super hipster, with fun doggo decor and trinkets. I do like what I call 'the quiet room' to the side of the main restaurant area. The food trucks are parked outside, and I totally need the baby vintage ice cream truck in my life! It was adorable!
When we came in, there was no one else there. We waited at the counter in silence, looking around like lost puppies off the \"short leash\". The blue-haired gal at the counter made it super weird by looking at us and asking if we were just there for a doughnut. After stuttering a while, we told her \"breakfast\". We also ordered a maple bacon doughnut from the case. This doughnut was fantastic. #1, bacon. #2, icing. And #3, bacon. 
The menu had a few breakfast items on it. I got the breakfast corn dog, and J got the breakfast sausage bowl. We also ordered a plain coffee for J, and a chai for me. The gal takes our order and disappears into the kitchen. And we wait. She comes out and ignores another patron, then eventually hits him with the same awkward doughtnut line. As if asking a question, seemingly as taken aback as we, he replies \"um, breakfast?\". Before running his order back, she looks at J and says \"the drip coffee's over there\", geaturing with a nod to the coffee stand, where there is no sweetener, no stirrers, and sparse half & half, while dropping an empty paper cup on the counter. She says nothing about my chai. 
The corn dogs on sticks were served with a warm syrup and apple slices. I really liked them, although I found that the casings of the sausage made them really difficult to bite through and eat. J didn't care for his bowl too much, and the jalapeno sausage was very, very spicy. The gal must have seen him sweating, because she asked if we wanted water, bringing us a bottle and glasses. She also tells me that she'll make my chai \"right now\". To my chagrin, the Oregon Chai mix box came out, and it was steamed and poured. She then added the almond milk and foamed it. I took a sip, and it was cold. After a few minutes, I was able to get her attention to heat it up. It was underwhelming, as the mixture was clearly more milk than chai.
We left without thanks or fanfare. Nobody cared that we were there anyway, so...
For our meal, it was NOT worth 30+ bucks,  and we will not be back."}
{"text":"My best friend had a Short Leash truck at her wedding and although the hotdogs were a hit with everyone, I was too busy making sure everything was going well so I unfortunately didn't really get to savor my hotdog. Well my husband and I returned this weekend and were not disappointed. I ordered the Devil Dog and my husband ordered the Moki, both with the bratwurst. Both are delicious and super filling. Our picky 4-yr-old had a regular beef dog with ketchup and nearly finished the entire thing, which left me with my mouth wide open. She never finishes her food! 

We also had the loaded fried with grated cheese, green chile and sour cream. I probably could have gone without them. The cheese wasn't melted enough and there wasn't enough sour cream on there for them to feel or taste \"loaded.\" The green Chile is also not spicy as I'm used to having it.

Wished we would have tried the doughnuts but we were just too stuffed after our meal. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Wow. Every time I come here I leave full, excited about the food I ate, and with a great feeling in my stomach. 

My friends and I came here to the restaurant after a night of canvassing around First Friday, and while it did take a while to get a table, once we sat down... It was all good. The appetizers were hearty and flavorful. The drinks were cold and fresh. The food was inventive and fun. It's always terrific to try new things here. 

Our service was from someone who was busy, sure, but really worked hard to make sure we had everything we needed to have a great time. 

I don't always eat in downtown Phoenix, but when I do, I prefer Short Leash."}
{"text":"Food, concept and design are fantastic! Love the cheddar brat and the naan for a bun is delicious! Almost every time we go though the service sucks. They're not attentive, never pay attention to your water and just really don't care. Last time we had all dirty cups... so that's a bummer and something they should fix cause it definitely keeps us from going more often. They used to have brunch and that was the bomb. Recommend for sure and a great place to bring folks from out of town"}
{"text":"I got the Mac and cheese hot dog a few days ago and it was very good, I also really enjoyed their kettle cooked chips. Would definitely suggest getting their all need hot dog instead of the regular one. Only complaint is that I think it's a little overpriced. $9.50 plus tax and tip, and that doesn't include a drink."}
{"text":"Yummmmm!!!! Who knew that wrapping your dog in naan would be like a heavenly pillow of tastiness. Whatever kind of hot dog you like, they got it! The soft naan and fun toppings are delightful. My favorite is the Lady with a veggie hotdog. And you should always have some fried pickles or save room for a housemade donut."}
{"text":"The bratwurst was tasty and covered in really well done sauerkraut. Unfortunately, the sauerkraut covered the pretzel bread making it too messy to be considered finger food, yet the bread was nearly impossible to cut with the butter knife provided. The fried pickles were delicious. When it come right down to it, my meal (hot dog, salad and pickles with an iced tea) was a bit high (in the $20 range) and the service was terrible. (Polite, but terrible.) I'd try Short Leash again if only to use it as an excuse for more pie from the Pie Hole."}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of these guys ever since I discovered their food truck at Food Truck Friday a couple summers ago.  There's a reason why people would stand in line for 25 minutes for one of their dogs.  They're THAT good.  

I was ecstatic to hear that the owners were finally fulfilling their dream of opening a sit down restaurant!  Thus, the Sit Stay Restaurant was born.

Everything that made Short Leash's food so good has carried over, and they've added even more!

The dogs are phenomenal!  Whether you go with one of the Menu items (Igby, Oliver, and Devil Dog are my favorites), or decide to build your own, you can't go wrong.

A couple other favorites:   Polka Dot Casserole, a gourmet twist on comfort food, and it is incredible!  

And one I didn't see coming, the Fried Pickles!!  I didn't know what to expect, but I don't have the words to describe how amazing these are!!  You need to experience them for yourself.

There are plenty of other things on the menu to amaze you as well!

The restaurant is clean and comfortable.  The wait staff is super friendly, and the service is excellent!

You can't go wrong with Short Leash Hot Dogs, either the mobile version, or at Sit...Stay!!"}
{"text":"I think this place is a hit or miss. When you look at the reviews, its usually really high or really low. 

First look, decor is really trendy. From all the little trinkets on the shelf to art on the wall. Loved it. Service was great too.

What this place loses stars for is the food. I came in with a big group and we ordered a lot of different things. I tried several of the appetizers including fried pickles, jalape√±o poppers, and a pretzel. All good but not great.

I had the moki for the main course. It was kind of messy and tasted on the average side. It didn't really stand out... I would not order it again.

They do have a great selection of beer and on Tuesdays they are only $2. Definitely would recommend trying this place, but I'm not a huge fan."}
{"text":"I love love love Shortleash hot dogs. The hot dogs are big and they will fill you up. The most wonderful thing about Shortleash is that you can replace every hot dog option with a vegetarian option! Completely veggie friendly. 

The prices aren't bad and last time I was there they had $2 beer specials. Any kind of beer you could want, they have. It's super casual with a laid back vibe. One of my fave casual restaurants in downtown Phoenix. Plus the patio is pet friendly! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try Short Leash for a long time, but I never got on board with the food truck trend. Why would I want to sit outside in the hot downtown sun when there are a hundred actual (air conditioned) restaurants in the area? When I heard they got an actual brick-and-mortar location, I was stoked, but had already moved across the country so I didn't get the chance to experience what everyone was going on about until now. 
It's right next to a gallery in a very artsy district of downtown (I think it's now literally called the Roosevelt Arts District), so lots of murals and public art, which gives it a nice feel. The parking lot is shared with a lot of other businesses so it looked really busy when there was still plenty of seating inside. They have a nice patio, too, which was perfect for this December afternoon, but I'm not sure how much use it gets during the 9 months of summer.
I tried the Mac Daddy, which is a beef hot dog in a naan topped with chili mac. The macaroni and cheese was good, though not as cheesy as \"three cheese\" would suggest. The chili was typical bean and beef chili, could have come from a can as far as I could tell. I loved that it came in a naan rather than a bun, so it had more toppings than your typical dog. I didn't like the tray it was served in - it keeps the taco/dog/thing upright for the toppings but when you start making a mess, the metal triangle just gets in the way. It should have been covered with a paper wrap under the dog, rather than being on top of the tray paper. It was also served with house-made potato chips which were a little too thick but decent enough. I'm not a fan of chips so I would have rather had fries or coleslaw, but I didn't see those options on the menu. 
They had a ton of drink options, including bottled sodas you don't typically see in Arizona, especially in restaurants, like Cheerwine and Faygo. They also have alcohol options with a full bar. 
Overall, a really great hot dog, but I felt it was a little over priced at $9.50. Hot dogs, no matter what you slap on top, are still hot dogs. With my bottled root beer and tip, a bit over $15 for lunch. It would have felt more worth it if I liked the potato chips."}
{"text":"I ate some macaroni and cheese hot dog and it was very interesting to say the least.  Sure it's loaded with fat, carbs, and who knows what else is in a hotdog, but it sure was delicious.  That said, the hotdog itself wasnt' anything amazingly special, but the dishes they make from it is.  Next time I'm going to try that crispy hot dog and see how that tastes first.  But as for my first impression, I like it and will return."}
{"text":"Went there on a First Friday, early enough that we didn't wait for a table.  Server was fairly prompt in getting our drink orders.  There was some confusion about an appetizer being available or not (it was but another server told us it wasn't...lol).  Placed our order, (Preztel dog and Mac Daddy bowl w/ Beef and beans) the scotch eggs were pretty good, not the best I've ever had, will have to come in and try them when they're fresher.  Entree's came out, one was spot on and correct, mine had to be returned to the kitchen as it was incorrect.  When it arrived, it was correct and very tasty.  The restaurant went above and beyond, imo,  to ensure that we were pleased with our meal.

It being a First Friday downtown would be why I expect the service was somewhat slow, they may have been understaffed or just swamped.  Server was very nice and I look forward to going back again.  The food receives a 3.5-4 stars... the service and attitude.. 5 Stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Best Hotdogs in Phoenix. My first trip there, I started off with a couple of scotch eggs. A sweet and a spicy mustard paired by the restaurant made it all the better. The craft beer selection was excellent ranging from the hoppy to the light. But back to the hotdogs. Not into buns? Great, try the Crispy dog. 3 hotdogs filled with cheese and jalape√±o, wrapped in in a crispy tortilla and deep fried. Even better, ask for it Monika style (wrapped in bacon) and a chipotle avocado cream sauce. The house made chips are a great pairing, and it about as good as it gets. The environment is friendly and very laid back, and the staff is very accommodating."}
{"text":"Ordered through postmates and left special instructions for a custom order, maybe it's a  postmates issue on how they transmit the order but it was completely wrong. Called short leash directly and they said to contact postmates, they couldn't do anything. I'm fully aware this is a 1st world issue but still super disappointing."}
{"text":"A good place to go!  I have found they have good food and good service.  This seems to be consistent from visit to visit.  They have great tasting hot dogs and brats with a wide variety of toppings all for about $6 to $7 per dog.

I would recommend that you give this place a try because I think you will enjoy it.

When you go in - tell them that Chris from Yelp recommended you go there.  They will have no idea who the hell I am but it might provide some interesting entertainment and a good laugh or two!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not only are the hot dogs so fun and unique the staff is friendly and owners responsive.  We have hit up short leash for a quick dinner a few times and also had them bring the truck to an event for our church.  They were super friendly helpful and served up tasty dogs for our entire group.
If looking for a fun dinner with the family or to cater a large group check out Short Leash."}
{"text":"I love the hot dogs from the hot dog truck so I had to try out their Short Leash restaurant. And it's amazing!!! The food is still awesome! They even have delicious donuts too. But what sets this place apart from any other place i have ever been to is the fact that even though this place is so busy one of the owners, Brad, still remembers me and makes my experience personal and not just like another customer."}
{"text":"Super tasty (but messy) dogs served by an incredibly friendly staff. $2 craft beers in a can on Tuesdays. And they have vegetarian dogs which means I'll be back with my girlfriend! Very pleased with this restaurant and will recommend it to my friends!"}
{"text":"This review is for Rollover Doughnuts only. Places an order through uber eats for iced coffee and a cinnamon roll. The iced coffee was half milk, which I cannot drink. There were no specifications online that anything came in the coffee. Also was not given any utensils with my order.  Pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of trying Short Leash's dogs at Yelp event and we were not disappointed (thanks, Lindsey D.). My hubby and I shared one and luckily he made good choices when choosing toppings. All of their dogs are served on Naan which is fantastical! The hubs chose jalape√±os, green chiles, pinto beans, ketchup, and mustard in a spicy beer brat. YUH-MEE! I hope I see this truck again...I'm gettin' my own next time!!"}
{"text":"This place was very unique and the meals were great. We went around 3 on a weekday so it wasn't very busy at all, which was great. Our server was decent, not exactly friendly but not rude either.

 We got fried pickles as an appetizer and were slightly disappointed as there wasn't much there. Maybe we were used to bigger portions but it seemed like they skimped out a bit. However, they were absolutely delicious.

 I was a little upset when I saw the menu, for hot dogs these are some pretty high priced meals. Either way, I ordered the Bear Dog while my friends ordered the Devil Dog. I wasn't too sure the Bear Dog sounded good but it seemed to be popular so I thought I'd go for it. I was glad I did - somehow it works I promise! The dogs came with baked chips which I thought was great. They tasted good and were a nice change from the cliche fries. 

My friends ordered doughnuts for dessert (I was too full) and were satisfied with them. 

Overall, very unique place and I would recommend it to anyone going through Phoenix. However, quite pricey so keep that in mind if you're deciding where to stop."}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing hot dogs, probably in the country. The choices for meat are exceptional. The breading for the dog was naan bread, phenomenal. Service was quick and we received our food in under 5-10 minutes. A++"}
{"text":"My daughter and I were excited to come here as we are huge fans of the food truck. We came on a week day afternoon, before it got too hot, and sat on the patio. The venue is small but cool and we will definitely come again. 

I had the Bear and my daughter had the Lady. We ordered two sides of the fried pickles but the server shared that the restaurant serving size was larger than that of the food truck so we changed to one order to share (kudos to the server!). 

Sadly, our food did not live up to our experiences with the food truck. Perhaps it was an off day or the hour (late afternoon, between typical lunch and dinner). We both though the flatbread in our dogs was dry and tough and wondered if it had been sitting out. Likewise the fried pickles were off a little and not as crunch nor tart as those we get from the food truck. I am a huge fan of the local beer and they had a good selection and mine was fresh and cold. 

We have gone to the food truck a number of times since visiting the Sit and Stay location and have continued to be thrilled with the food from the food truck. I am thinking we caught them in the brick and mortar on a bad day or at a bad time. For that reason, and because the customer service was excellent at Sit and Stay, we will definitely be back at least one more time."}
{"text":"Just what I was looking for: a local success story with great food at a decent price. I came in at about 12:30 on a Friday afternoon. The lunch crowd was light, and I had my choice of seats inside or out. I sat on the patio to enjoy the nice December day. I noticed they are very dog friendly. Several patrons had dogs with them, and one took advantage of the water bowl provided outside.

I ordered the pimiento cheese dip and the all-beef Igby. The pimiento cheese was delicious. It tasted like it was made on site and came with delicious fresh made flat bread. The grease on your fingers should give you an idea of the flavor and health levels of the food.

The Igby comes with cole slaw, bleu cheese and BBQ sauce, served on a pita or possibly naan bread. The cheese was funky enough to prove it didn't come out of a bottle, while not so strong as to overpower the other flavors. Honestly I would have been fine without the dog, which tasted just fine. The bites I got of just slaw, cheese and sauce were mouth-wateringly delicious.

I'm a big enough eater, but this was too much food for me. I was leaving that night and unable to bring a to-go box. I left behind a little less than half the pimiento dip and a handful of the fresh made chips that came with the dog. The chips could have used more salt and/or a dip of their own, but they were well made and good tasting.

Chad's service was friendly throughout the meal, and my total bill was under $20 for the food and a gourmet root beer. It seemed like they had a big selection of canned beer, but I was working and not able to try any. Maybe next time.

I also didn't have room for dessert, although now I'm thinking a strawberry cheesecake donut to go would have been a good idea. I guess I have something to try next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"++fried pickles, shepherd's pie special, local beer on tap, patio
- - currywurst (the worst)

Things started out well. There were two of us, and we sat on patio. Waitress couldn't remember everything on tap (only a few) but offered to bring a sample of the type of beer I was interested in. We ordered the fried pickles, which were excellent - sweet pickle, savory batter and dipping sauces. The portion was large for two people (I think four could split it and be satisfied). 

So many items on the menu sound interesting. I ordered the currywurst.  This was described as knockwurst slow cooked in a tomato & onion curry sauce served in a flatbread bowl with a mixed green side salad. It is basically just as described (except the bread was flat, not in a bowl shape) but it tasted pretty awful. It was like slightly watered down tomato paste with a little onion and sliced hot dog on top of some naan, oh and some curry powder sprinkled on top. The sauce was so thick and plentiful, you could barely see the wurst slices. I ate about half the bread under the sludgy sauce and fished out the wurst. I had to remind the server that brought my dish (not our waitress) that it came with a side salad. It tasted alright, nothing special.

The person I was with went with the featured special - shepherd's pie dog. It came with a side of chips. I tasted it and found it to be what I was thought I would get from this place - an unexpected and impressive twist that completely worked. My dining partner wasn't expecting much from the restaurant but was sold upon biting into this. He was already planning a repeat visit. I wish I had ordered this as well, but, b/c this was our first visit, I wanted to try different things in order to get a feel for what was on offer. 

I really hope the currywurst is the only miss on the menu. I wish I had noticed the other yelp reviewer who panned it and ordered something else. I also wonder if anyone does like this or if the cook just didn't do it right (given it didn't look like the photo short leash has of it on a website and that the salad was forgotten)."}
{"text":"Surprised I haven't reviewed this spot yet. Loved coming here when I used to work nearby and it beat going to Food Truck Friday because the crowd was significantly smaller. I normally order The Bear with a vegetarian dog and replace the bacon with jalape√±os, I still enjoy the eclectic mix of flavors. Service is always friendly here, and today when ordering to go I chose a blueberry lemon brioche donut that was pretty yummy. They've got a good space with a patio suitable for post summer weather, and haven't had an issue finding parking here. As long as I'm a hot dog fan, I'll continue coming here."}
{"text":"After experiencing the Short Leash Food Truck, it was nice to try the sit down place. Love the variety of different types of dogs you can get. There is something for vegans, vegetarians and the good ol' hot dog lovers. Definitely recommend the fried pickles and jalape√±o poppers off the appetizer menu. Only downfall really is the hot dogs seem small because they are buried under all the ingredients you order on it. Overall great place for lunch or dinner and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good food but they charge $2.50 for one 12oz can of diet soda. No bueno in my book. They can get away with that with free refills, but not for one can. Otherwise it was okay. Please get a soda machine and leave the third world behind. 

Real reviews, really."}
{"text":"This place is really neat! Our waiter was super friendly and had a very dashing mustache, added to the charm of the place. When you walk inside, the decor is very simple and nice.  I had the bratwurst which is cooked in four peaks kiltlifter beer (my fave beer!!)  with sauerkraut, onions and bacon topped with swiss cheese and sweet delicious bavarian mustard. I asked for their homemade chips which were super good. They also had Four Peaks beer on tap, which is pretty awesome as they're supporting local breweries. The bathrooms are unisex, which was totally different from what I'm used to, but somehow it worked. There's a nifty little pie spot right next door that I'm going to have to try at my next visit. I will be coming back here for sure."}
{"text":"The selection of beer is vast and very reasonably priced. The hot dogs we ordered we're sufficiently awesome and interesting."}
{"text":"Hot dogs! My weakness. Since becoming vegetarian, it's been a struggle to find a decent veggie dog and after years of searching, I FOUND IT. The most delicious and unique variety kind too! 

Short Leash offers lots of different variety on plain hot dogs but their \"build your own\" takes the cake! I made my very own concoction of a spicy and savory veggie dog. I love coming here and trying another variation of it. It's definitely worth the 30 min drive! Every time I come, I have to double check that my hot dog is a veggie because it's that good. It doesn't even taste vegetarian. I ordered a salad for the side but I enjoy the chips better. The salad had a bit too much dressing for me. 

The price is very reasonable too! On Sunday we came for brunch and ordered jalape√±o poppers (homemade, none of that frozen stuff) a mimosa, Mexican sprite, two build your own dogs, AND two delectable donuts  all for under $40 bucks! I love this place. Thank you for existing and catering to us vegetarians. We really do appreciate it.

Now for the service: It's been very good so far. There was one incident where they gave me the wrong hot dog, real vs vegetarian, but they gave me a new one quick. My husband got my veggie dog and he didn't even notice due to the delicious flavors. 

Definitely my favorite place to go eat hot dogs! Try it just once. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Short Leash for lunch and it was such a great experience.  The staff was very inviting and helpful and the food was RIDICULOUS!!!  I ordered the Aiko with a vegetarian dog and my husband ordered the Monika.  Both of these dishes were just so different and sooo DELICIOUS!  To top it off our side dish that we ordered and shared was the Arugala salad and OH MY GOSH it was just heaven!!!!  The food here is truly AMAZING and it needs to be eaten!!!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I'd go back even tho I had the Bear, and really thought is was too sweet.  Next time I'm doing the build-your-own hotdog, but overall I like this concept.  Kinky, cute idea you won't find any place else.
Don't think this is some cheap hot dog place as 2 gourmet dogs, 2 beers, one fried pickles and one corn dog appetizer with tip came up to $45.  The corn dog appetizer is HUGE, so the son took it to his girl's afterward to share.  
The fried pickles were great to me, so I'd come back just for that being the big fried pickle fan that I am....and darn, if it isn't hard to find good ones and these are good! Very good!!!
They have a wide variety of canned beers for $3 which was fun to choose.  I got something peachy which was decent.
This is a cute place for a date I think, however, I saw people here with little kids and for $8.50 a dog not sure if I would take little ones here.  Another adult, tho, you bet.
The food is good, the service was great, the concept is beyond clever considering this place is a little tiny room with a minimum of decor.  Someone who owns this place is mighty clever as a marketer.  I admire them anyway for their creativity if nothing else and taking a very simple product (hot dog) and spiffing them up, serve a few good sides, cans of beer (no glasses, no washing) and charge healthy prices = clever.
This one is a \"gonna return\" to....I really liked it overall alot."}
{"text":"The best hot dog you'll ever have. The menu is always in flux. The pretzel hotdog is bonkers and the patio is perfect for people watching on the burgeoning Roosevlt Row. Indoor and outdoor seating. Small bar inside."}
{"text":"I'm a dog lover... and a vegetarian. And I think Short Leash is heaven on Earth!!

Stopped here for lunch last week with coworkers who raved about the place. I have heard about their food truck for a long time and couldn't wait to try their veggie dog. I was NOT disappointed!

The atmosphere is great... casual and funky. I love the pictures of the dogs by the bathroom wall. My life's goal is to get my dog's pic up there. Even though we dined inside, the patio looks like a great place to have a couple beers and eat a dog WITH your dog.

The vast array of toppings makes it a bit challenging to order for an indecisive person such as myself. They have a few specialty dogs that take the guesswork out of it, however I'm pretty picky and found things on each dog I didn't like.

I ended up getting *drumroll*... a veg dog with tomatoes, pinto beans, cilantro, and chipotle cream cheese. Winner, winner, chicken dinner!

The naan. *Sigh* As an Indian food lover I have had LOTS of naan in my lifetime. This is the BEST naan I have ever had. Light and fluffy. The dog itself was tasty and all the toppings were fresh and abundant.

The chips that accompanied it were freshly made and tasty.

An eatery that honors people's pooches and gives vegetarians and meat lovers alike a place to get their gourmet hot dogs on? With booze? I think I'm in love."}
{"text":"I ordered the devil dog and the green chili cheese fries. 
The fries are ok, I didn't really eat much of them. you get a lot.
The devil dog I liked, wasn't spicy and I might order again but id probably try something different next time with all the choices."}
{"text":"Hot Dog Heaven! YUMMY! As an animal rescuer, vegetarian, that loves to support  local businesses, it does not get any better than Short Leash. I just moved here from, well, let's go with back, \"East\". My daughter said I would love this place and she was right. Great hot dogs, super nice staff, loved the pictures of the dogs on the wall, reasonable prices.  I see Short Leash in my future a lot!"}
{"text":"Amazing, eccentric selection of hot dogs! I'm so glad that this funky food truck opened up an actual restaurant, because it's much more convenient than searching for the truck when I'm craving a hot dog! I can't remember the name of the item I always order but it's basically a hot dog on their naan bread covered in chili and mac n cheese! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"-Bear-yum!! Our fave.
-Sunny-okay, prob try something else.
-Crispy dogs- Hubby thought pretty tasty but prefers the Bear. I liked the cheesy sausage inside but not really the crispy tortilla shell. Still... Probably worth having once.
-Devil dog-second to the Bear (per hubby)
-lemonade- delishhhh

This is surely a place I need to come back many times so I can try everything!"}
{"text":"Decided to try something different and it was but in a good way! Ordered the jalape√±o poppers and let me tell you!!! They were HOT!!!!! But so good! Also ordered the devil dog and I give it a thumbs up!. Also ordered the corn dogs and enjoyed them also ."}
{"text":"This place is so stupid!!! Went in for lunch with my puppy. Thinking hey! There's a dog friendly environment. Walked in and the hostess says there's are no pets allowed. Strike 1!!!! So I asked if the patio was available and she says it's too hot and sits us anyways.... Did a couple of orders and 5mins later comes back and tells me that they are out of it. Strike 2!!!! Still giving them the benefit of a doubt... Walked in and asked for another order and it was also out... It's midday and you don't have nothing on the menu!! And tells me they have soup! It's 90degrees out and you expect me to eat soup?! Strike 3!!! Why do you even bother opening in the first place? For drinks? Stupid stupid place!!!! No stars! Just arse!"}
{"text":"So I have to start this off saying this place is super cute! I am a dog owner and love places that are into their pups. The donuts  are really good made from scratch and if this was just a rating based on the donuts they would get five stars. However, we ordered coffee  and breakfast. We ordered vanilla lattes and they were not very flavorful, in fact they kind of tasted like burnt beans (the espresso machine probably needs to be cleaned). That being said I am a coffee snob and love good coffee/espresso. The breakfast options are inventive. My husband rated his breakfast doughnut sandwich a 2 for taste and a 5 for creativity so over all 3. I had the breakfast wrap which was filling but almost too much like hotdogs and eggs I ate as a child. I would rate it a 3 for taste. The breakfast fries were a 5. I will definitely give this place another try b/c I like supporting the little spots and the donuts were amazing."}
{"text":"Yum!! 
The best place to grab a dog. Such a variety to choose from. Went there with a big group and everyone was very pleased! Pricy but we'll worth it."}
{"text":"i guess the shine has come off of this place for me...its still got some decent food but the transition to brick and mortar brings some slow service and (if i am thinking clearly) raised prices for what was already a bit overpriced before. wifes food came out cold after a long wait,on a night that was not over-crowded or anything.

so yeah, 3 stars because its not great, but its not bad. now the Pie Hole that is set inside of there on the other hand, ooooh boy i cant say enough good things about them. but thats another review..."}
{"text":"I'm more than willing to sit, stay, rollover, play dead, shake, or whatever trick Short Leash Hot Dogs wants me to do to enjoy one of its wonderful hot dogs. I've loved the truck, so naturally I would love the restaurant. And even better, I can enjoy the food pretty much whenever I want without the lines that always accompany the truck.

Just so you know, there is not a lot space in the restaurant or parking lot. I had to use a meter down the street, but don't worry, meters downtown take credit cards.

Also; If you want a pretty good donut for desert, there is a bakery case with some Rollover Donut selections in the back."}
{"text":"For all you haters out there. Go on ahead and hate. For every person that's not a fan of this fine establishment, there are 5 more that love it. It's science. 

The great thing about the sit down restaurant from Short Leash is the beer. I mean really. What goes better with that all American dog than a frosty cold American style IPA from a local brewery? Uh... Not a damn thing! Plus this place has appetizers and a dollar on the wall. Can you get that from your other hot dog place? I think not! It's great for groups, as long as you're not a group of buttheads. Or a super large group. Ain't nobody got time for that... 

Only thing you should definitely be aware of is that the price is a tad higher than if you ordered the same thing from the truck. So I always try and stray from my usual and venture out onto the rest of the menu. 

I have yet to try breakfast but I will soon!"}
{"text":"I waited a month since my last review to return. I realize they were in transition from sit-down service to counter service at the time. That doesn't bother me, but they had nothing displayed to show that they were transitioning, and nobody said anything about it to me when I walked in. I returned last week to see that they've moved the counter that used to be right beside the front door to the wall you face when you walk in. Now, you walk up to the counter (or grab a menu and stand in line), place your order, and pay. You then sit where you want and grab your own water by the patio door. They'll bring your drink and food out to you. They may check on you once, but if you need anything you'll have to ask. Also, the dessert (donuts and other things) are located in a display case beside the front counter.

The food was great as usual! I got a bratwurst and fried pickles with the dragon sauce - so good! I'll definitely continue to recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"One of the best hot dog spots I've found in Phoenix. My boyfriend ordered a crispy dog and I got a Moki and we both were very impressed. Will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Overall solid food. It's not easy to take something as classic as a hot dog, completely reinvent it and make it work. Short leash has done that. 

Whether u want spicy, savory, or something completely bananas they have it. I got the bear dog which had peanut butter, BBQ sauce, bacon, gouda and cracker jax. Sounds weird, tastes awesome. Also, the fried pickles are pretty bomb, albeit a little more sweet than sour (if you're really into sour pickles you've been warned). The chips that came with my dog (which I chose over a salad, duh) were the only shitty part. They appeared homemade and we're warm but really needed salt or some kind of flavor, besides dull potato. But who cares, fuck chips! 

I'll definitely be back, although I wish the prices were a little lower for a hot dog place (8.50!) Probably create my own dog next time from their endless list of options. Live down the street, two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Omg...I finally came here! Man I was super excited coming to experience what all my help friends have been talking about. A hot dog...yes a hot dog...not what you would ever expect. These dogs are art!  From the min I walked into the restaurant I find a small table and grabbed a menu look at all the options. Mac n chees dog or the Bear with peanut butter?? After suggestions from the server she tells me I have to try the Bear because it's their famous dog. Wow I'm glad I did!!  The best hot dog I've ever had in my life. I'm a huge fan of peanut butter, but I was a little worried about the BBQ sauce and cheese, but nope.. Tasted amazing together. I can't wait till I can come back for another one!

The rest if the dogs also looked good. Plus they serve local beers too.  

Overall Short Leash is amazing. I'm going to make this my must stop when I'm in downtown."}
{"text":"Killer place, killer food, killer service, killer vibe.  Great first visit.  Lots of creative choices on the menu.  I had the Bratwurst Stuffed Pretzel Roll, the only thing I would have changed would have been to melt the cheese a little on top, other than that, it was awesome!  For a side I had the best fried pickles I've ever had in my life, and I've had A LOT of fried pickles over the years.  These had a sweet flavor in the background, not sure what the batter was, but they were excellent.   

They also have a second \"restaurant\" inside called Rollover Doughnuts, I'll be back for those soon!"}
{"text":"NO VALUE. The brat was tasty and very small. The pretzel bun was a little dry. It is more of a role than a bun, so you will be eating it with a knife and fork. There are too many places around town to get great food for what they are charging. 

I will be going to Schreiner's Sausage Co. for their brown bag special for half the price. They buy their hotdogs from Schreiner's."}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced for the mediocre food that you are served.  I have had much better hotdogs at half the price.  I'm not sure how these guys stay in business.

If you want a better hotdog, go to El Caprichoso Hot Dogs Estilo Sonora at 35th Ave. and Thomas."}
{"text":"Best fried pickles ever. I swear there's something addictive in the batter because I need them at least once a week."}
{"text":"Yummy and fun menu. It's counter service and a small dining room. They are good about fixing something that you don't like. The Mac and cheese is super yummy. Haven't tried the doughnuts. But they looked good."}
{"text":"Small restaurant but very bright and I think there is also a patio but I sat inside. The staff was very nice and the food was so good, I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Came in and was greeted immediately. Nice atmosphere, ingredients tasted so fresh. Got the jalape√±o poppers--so good!  The devil dog was very good as well. Get some dragon sauce on the side for it and some fries and your meal will be great.  I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Really good and quality ingredients....haven't tried the donuts but the hotdogs are bomb and the employees were super friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"A little on the pricey side for \"gourmet\" hot dogs, so that takes away a star. However overall I really can't complain. Their food is unique, to say the least, and is definitely a niche. They're located right on Roosevelt Row in downtown Phoenix so given the amount of regular foot traffic it is tricky to stay in business there. 
On our visit I was stunned how silly and goofy the waitress was. Maybe it was just me and the long trip we just returned from but it was refreshing that she was just as interested in chatting with my girlfriend and I as she was in taking our orders. 
Honestly we ended up getting the appetizer, dinner, and dessert for that very reason. 
Service is big for me, having worked in the food service industry myself in the past. So I can't speak highly enough about great service. 
Again it's a unique joint but worth the drive into downtown and certainly worth the price."}
{"text":"The C-Clan went to Sit-Stay on grand opening night.  We got there just in time as we took 2 of the last seats at the community table.  The wait was the better part of 1hr to get in afterwards.   

We decided to order some corndog bites (though J wanted to order the Scotch Eggs) as a starter.  Mini versions of the jalapeno cheese corndogs...drool!  

J's order - The Mac Daddy, which he raved about!

My order - A salad for which I can not remember the name.  Had grilled peaches, chicken sausage, and 2 slices of fried goat cheese.  Perhaps it was the Sunny?  Salad dressing was pretty non-existent.  Though the dog was flavorful, I probably wouldn't order the salad again.    

Baby Cs order - Kids polka dot casserole.  A penne pasta with a cheese sauce and slices of hot dog.  Baby C enjoyed the pasta and bites of dog.  

Other than my salad, the only thing that would make Sit/Stay better is if they had high chairs.  Baby C had to sit in my lap because unfortunately they only have booster seats.  Baby C is a too small for a booster.  And there's a big difference between going to a restaurant and having a 13month old sit in my lap vs visiting the truck at the Phoenix Public Market and having the baby lap it.   So hopefully they'll have a highchair or two by the time we go again, or maybe we'll just bring our travel highchair.

But all in all, it was a great experience!  We don't have to stalk, er, chase the food truck for our dog fix!  YAY!"}
{"text":"My first experience with hot dogs was pleasantly surprised. I ordered chicken bear it was good with peanut butter sauce, my beau ordered devil and chili hotdogs he was not sure he will like devil but he enjoyed both of those it just was too much in the end and he couldn't finish. As we ordered a side of jalape√±o poppers and fries which were not bad either. We couldn't leave shop without trying donuts they made our night we tried chocolate cookie dough and chocolate nuts both were yumilicious we have been craving those everyday."}
{"text":"This was a great experience! Had an awesome bartender/server, Brittany! She was definitely busy between the bar and the floor, but she remained very sweet, patient and suggestive! She went over the beer list and took the time to let me taste the local beer on draft. Also, as curious as I was about the Bear Dog, I was still very unsure! She encouraged me to try it and suggested I pair it with the spicy beer dog! Hands down the best hot dog I have ever had! Thanks Brittany for being so kind and attentive and thanks to the cook that prepared my food! Two thumbs up! I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The dogs with the cheese inside wrapped in a hard shell taco... GOOD LAWD! And that mustard sauce, I mean, c'bon c'bon!"}
{"text":"Went for an early lunch with my wife last week. I had the Oliver, which was tasty but very greasy and quite heavy. She had corn dogs which I thought were awful. At first they came out with raw batter inside- staff was very pleasant and comped the corn dogs. They came back and the batter just tasted bizarre. I couldn't put my finger on why- perhaps too much pepper? But it wasn't what she wanted or expected. The chips were slightly stale and chewy but had great flavor.

The ambiance and service were great and I couldn't give less than 3 stars to a place smart enough to serve a hot dog on naan (my favorite) but we won't be returning. Would much rather go to teds which is more classic, simple and well done."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to visit their brick and mortar for a while know and finally had the chance last week. It's exactly what I expected, a cute little shop with tons of local flare. TONS. I already knew going in that I wanted the Bear, but there were so many other tempting things on the menu (Sweet Republic ice cream, Mama Toledo's pies, their new donuts and fritters!!). The service was great and I enjoy their homemade chips. We opted to try a donut before we left, I had the cinnamon sugar and my friend had the orange and pistachio one. I had no idea what brioche donuts were and I learned that they are much thicker/denser than your typical donut. They'd go great with a cup of coffee or tea. I with these guys the best of luck, especially since they just opened up another location."}
{"text":"Someone may want to call the police to check welfare on the bartender. By her subtle cues and body language, she obviously doesn't want to be here and is possibly being held against her will. 

Description: female, early 20s, dark hair, glasses, tribal earrings.

Other than the lack of customer service, the food was fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is awesome variety of unique items to choose from.  Love the jalape√±o cheese dogs. The corn dog bites are yummy.  If you like different beers this is the place for you."}
{"text":"What a fun little place to dine during the First Friday art festival.  We came here about 7ish and they had live music outside on the patio.  We ordered our food quickly and found a seat outside to listen to the couple singing.  We ordered two hot dogs at $8.00 a piece.  Both came on pita bread which was bizarre for me but it worked and both were nice sized.  I ordered the chili dog with their spicy beer hot dog (as opposed to just a regular dog) with no raw onion (just chili and cheese) and my sister ordered \"The Lady\" (chipotle cream cheese, saut√©ed onion + fried pickles).  My sister loved her dog.  Mine was good but I wish I would have had the option for a regular bun.  We ordered a side of fried pickles which was a nice sized order for $8.00.  These were very tasty!  Our sodas were $2.50 each and came in a glass bottle.  My sister had a Mexican Coke and I had Leninade (Blood Orange soda).  This is place is definitely worth a try for the vast selection of dogs they have.  Check out their menu to see all of the nifty items to try,"}
{"text":"wow. 
 chili-mac & cheese hot doge. wow. so delight. such donuts. wow v amaez ice tea.  such wow water bottle v glass so blue wow. wow amaze staff.  Also wow. So taste. So doge. wow so hot doge. very doge. much flavor. very yum. 
pls toast the naan tho.
wow."}
{"text":"Oh...my. I am normally not a fan of hot dogs. They have never sat well with me. But seriously? This place is amazing. They have created a name for themselves by finding a perfect niche- spicing up the hot dog. Sometimes literally. Not to mention, their beer selection is STELLAR. The staff seem really happy to work there, which says something. Our waitress was super knowledgeable about different beers and the menu. We MAY have overdid it with the corndog appetizer AND a hot dog meal each, but I have no regrets. Those cheddar jalepeno dogs have my heart, and so does Short Leash."}
{"text":"Love this place. Mac Daddy and the Lady are my two favorites. Try one of the local brews with your meal while you're at it!"}
{"text":"Wow...I consider myself lucky to have had the opportunity to try this place the other night and sad that I hadn't made it over there before!  I love hotdogs, but rarely do I have one that lives up to the hype.  For instance, I had one a month or so ago that had been written up in a couple of magazines, and I was very disappointed because, although the meat was very good, the bun was too big, so really all I tasted was bread...definitely not the case with the Short Leash dogs!  I love, love, love the fact that they are served in naan instead of a bun.  Like the example I mentioned, buns too often dull the taste of the dog.  I ordered the Oliver, an all-beef dog topped with melted swiss, sauerkraut, and Thousand Island, and I added fried pickles!  Holy hot dogs, it was amazing!!  My friend and I had split the corn dogs bites to start with, and they were very delicious and sizeable--definitely more than \"bites.\"  So, I figured there was no way I would eat my entire hotdog.  But it was so delicious that I just couldn't put it down!  My friend had the Mac Daddy, which she loved.  I took a bite of it, and the mac 'n' cheese and chili combination was fantastic.  The only thing I didn't like was my drink.  I had some sort of sangria, but not the raspberry one, and it just tasted very odd.  I will not order that again, but I will definitely be back to Short Leash as soon as I can for the food!  I want to try almost everything on the menu :)

One more thing, I saw someone else's review that said that the corndog bites were undercooked and \"bizarre\"...they must have had an off day at that visit because they were wonderful when I had them.  I've actually never had corndog bites outside of the southeast that I've been happy with, and these were perfect.  They were perfectly cooked and a perfect ratio of meat to batter!  They are quite large and filling, though, so, if you have a small appetite, you might want to skip them, split them, or have as entr√©e."}
{"text":"This is a cool place downtown for some delish dogs and donuts! I recommend anything in a pretzel roll, but the flat bread is good too."}
{"text":"The reason i like this place is because it is AWESOME! There is no place like it...I am a really big fan of unique and artistic places that i can find serve really good food. Anybody can open a kitchen and a dining room and have people walk the food out to customers but when your server practically sits down at the table with you (after invited to) and jokes around with you, telling you her favorite things on the menu and secret treats that they serve, that the difference. I first learned about short leash from their Biltmore Fashion District location in \"The Union\"  which is a neat little shopping district in the middle of all the huge brand name stores. When the friendly ladies over there told my girlfriend about their original downtown phoenix location, i didn't hear the end of it until we visited. When we drove down there to try it, our minds were blown the second time, even more than they were when we first found this hidden shop at the Biltmore. WOW! Basically Willy Wonka of Hot dogs and beer floats. That's right! Beer Floats! First i've heard of those as well!!! Overall, i would say that if i was moving i would probably consider downtown phoenix just because this place would be my regular stop! Go Here! Its not a review, or a recommendation, its an Order! You are missing out if you havent tried Short Leash Hot Dogs.....but its only hot dogs....no, its not only hot dogs.... hahah"}
{"text":"In Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl - GO BUCKS! Staying downtown and stopped here for lunch to go.

I was excited about the vegetarian hot dog option with Lady topping, and my dad went for classic all beef with Chicago topping.  He found his to be just the right crunch and mine tasted so authentic I was almost concerned it was meaty.  We also got a starter of fried pickle chips, with two tasty dips.  Fried pickles were very sweet so beware if you are not a sweet pickle fan.

The ambiance was very hipster and the staff were super friendly.  

We also bought donuts per the recommendations and yet to eat them- but you can't go wrong with a pistachio orange cream cake donut!  Mmmmm...."}

HOLY COW

KABOOM

if that bastardized version of a Haiku did not convince you of this place's extraordinariness, then just go, order the Crispy Dog, eat it, look me in the eye, and try not to recite that haiku

i dare you"}
{"text":"Looking for something familiar with a twist.. check out this spot you won't be disappointed..

I seem to always pick the same thing when I come here .. the Sunny.. a chicken hotdog with peaches, goat cheese, arugula served on naan. Not your regular hotdog and the flavor combo is delish! 

Save room for a donut or sweet treat.. as always I had the bourbon donut.. a brioche donut with chocolate custard .. dusted with powdered sugar.. so good!"}
{"text":"I didn't believe hot dogs could be this good! This is a unique twist that sounds interesting to say the least and ends up being amazing. I had my doubts and now will be a regular! I had the lady with fried pickles and cream cheese and other goodies all on naan and chips that were fresh, homemade and I want another! They have a good selection of interesting combinations and dogs including a vegetarian one, a spicy brat, etc. I had fried green tomatoes from their food truck once as well and they were great. service was quick and friendly, prices are worth it, the place is small but has charm. Great location and we were able to find parking right down the street not to far. I have been twice now and had the lady both times because it was so good but I will venture to other combinations soon!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been here, you MUST try The Lady! Soooo delicious and the fried pickles are amazing as well. The staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"Had a blast, the food is good and the location and atmosphere are great. We took the kids and it was a wonderful time. I want more fun and unique places like this in Phoenix, thanks for being one of the few:) 

Great for friends, family, or just a quick bite"}
{"text":"It's a down-to-earth hot dog eatery that lets you choose from dozens of toppings.
You don't even have to have a plain old dog. Make it vegan. Polish, even. I made mine a brat. Oh, and there's naan (think pita bread, only better) instead of a regular bun.

I ordered the \"bear\", with a very sweet BBQ sauce, peanut butter, and bacon. Sounds weird enough to work! I enjoyed it, even if the toppings outshone the bratwurst itself, probably because it was small and actually kind of bland. 

Toppings usually complement the meal, but an easy criticism here is how toppings BECOME the meal itself. On the other hand, in an age in which everyone wants to innovate staples like pizza and burgers, they insist on limiting hot dogs. You've got Chicago, Sonora, chili or good ol' ball-park-style traditional. That's it. Short Leash changes that. 

Also, the house-made chips suck. Half of them were soggy. I won't really hold that against them, though. 

Overall, Short Leash is doing what most restaurants don't--take ONE very simple concept, and focus on executing it. It's not perfect, but they've got the best hot dog selection in town, so I can't be too hard on them."}
{"text":"Stopped by early while checking out the graffiti walls in the area. 
Decided on the following Doughnuts:
Chocolate chip cookie dough 
Peanut butter pretzel
Everything bagel stuffed with veggie cream cheese. 
All of it was amazing! Plus the great service and it was an all around awesome visit."}
{"text":"1.5 stars for the beer selection. 
0.5 stars for the food. 

Had the \"Bear\" which caught my eye as the menu described it with peanut butter, BBQ sauce. I thought \"wow, if someone can pull this off I will be amazed!\". I was not amazed. I was also not amused by the side of fries which were obviously the frozen, seasoned variety. My better half had the \"aiko\" which was a better effort than the \"bear\" but nothing to write home about.  

I wish this restaurant all the best. It's always good to have local eateries.  But alas I won't be back any time soon. Well, maybe just for a beer."}
{"text":"The devil dog was so delicious!! You choose a wiener and select a custom made or you can decide to add your own toppings. The devil dog was so delicious!! Oops.. Did I write that twice?? ... Well, it was really delicious. Definitely a gem in an area where there were tons of artwork, park, rummage sale, etc. definitely go when you're super hungry because it is extremely filling... But even still... I ended up finishing the weiner and condiments without the naan..it was so delicious!! Okay I'll stop:)"}
{"text":"I have to be honest, I was so bummed. We've eaten at the food truck MANY times and even at private catered events and we LOVE their food. Today we went to their sit down location because we were in the area and what a disappointment. The waitress brought us water but never asked if we wanted something else to drink. Brought kids waters 20mins into service. We asked for a high chair twice and ended up having to get one ourselves. It was not busy. We were one of four tables (others each were only 1 person). Food took forever. My hush puppies were awesome. Corn dog poppers great. Never offered ketchup only mustard. The Aoki is normally my fave but the mango chutne was actually just a mashed up mango. No flavoring. Before it was almost like a chopped salsa. The mango was so fresh before but this tasted canned. Also the mixed green side was under seasoned and wilted. I almost sent my meal back but never had a waitress check on us so it was pointless. We sat for almost 15 mins with cleared plates and finally got our check. Took another 15 mins to close out. Asked for lolly pops for the kids and she rolled her eyes and then brought them out after mentioning it again. 

Again I love their food truck. And their hush puppies and fried green tomatoes were great but the service and Aoki was so disappointing."}
{"text":"I like the beer selection, but I dislike the new system with ordering. Each time you want something, you need to get up and order it at a register, which cuts out the personal service from the servers. My favorite person at Short Leash, Mary Lynn, is gone now and I miss her sense of humor and awesome service. She remembered everyone's orders and always delivered our things with a smile, joke or well wishes. Won't be going any back anymore due to the new system and the loss of Mary Lynn"}
{"text":"I came here with some friends. I like the place and they have a nice selection of beers. I had the liquid amber and I liked it so much I got two! 

For my meal, I ordered the currywurst and pickle chips. I first had currywurst at Disney Epcot and so i was comparing it to that. When the dish came out, I thought it was actually someone else's. I'll be honest and say I didn't really like it. It looked like a pizza. It tasted like sliced up hot dog in prego sauce with curry sprinkled on top. Plus it was lukewarm. I really wanted to like it but I didn't. I would be open to trying more items on their menu though.

I had some of my friends homemade chips and they were sooo awesome! I like it a lot. I also liked the fried pickles! Those were great too, and I highly recommend those items.

Btw, also, frosted glasses with your beer!!"}
{"text":"I've always loved Short Leash Dogs, so Sit... Stay is just more of a good thing. I have to say that they found a great location for their bricks and mortar restaurant. And the ambience is clean yet eclectic with lots of clever little touches... like the fire hydrants on the outside of the bathroom doors.

The beer selection adds to the already stellar fare (who doesn't like a beer with their hot dog?) and is appropriately focused on craft beer and local breweries.  As for the food, I've raved in the past about their signature dogs served in flatbreads... but now I've found a new favorite.  The beer hot sausage done up as the Bear is amazing.  Imagine smoked gouda, peanut butter, BBQ sauce, bacon and caramel corn all together with a spicy sausage, and you have the makings of a gourmet classic.  I can't seem to order anything else when I visit. 

Sidenote: I tried the currywurst and was a bit disappointed. Maybe I'm overly critical having grown up in Germany, but the curry ketchup on this dog (while seemingly house-made) lacks the sweet and spicy punch that defines the true German street food classic.

The corn pups are also a great starter. I like that they seem to include a mixture of the traditional hot dog and Schneider's jalape√±o cheese sausage in the corn pups.  It makes each one a little bit of a surprise. If they really want to elevate this dish (even though it's already great), they should consider sourcing the jalape√±o cheese brats from Von Hanson's in the East Valley. If you read my review on Von Hanson's, you will find that I have an undying love for this particular sausage.

I'll sit... and I'll stay. As long as I get my fill here on the legit dogs and beer!"}
{"text":"To say that I love Short Leash is an understatement. In fact, they will be catering my wedding this November because I want to share the wonderfulness that is Short Leash with all my family and friends.

But enough about me, what you really want to know is why you should eat here:

1) I have never had a dish that I didn't like from Short Leash! It's hard to narrow it down to few favorites, but I definitely recommend the Aiko (add Sriracha if you like spicy), Moki, and Devil Dog. And definitely get the chips for your side. They are homemade and delicious! The fried pickles are also a great choice if you're looking to start with an appetizer.

If you happen to be here for dinner,  get the bacon-wrapped cheddar brats since they only serve it after 5 p.m. and also because it's amazing.

2) Not only are the toppings unique and interesting, but there is enough variety to satisfy everyone in a group. I have vegetarian friends that love Short Leash, and if you happen to have friends who eat gluten free, they can leave happy too.

3) You can definitely taste the freshness of your ingredients, and I love that everything comes from local vendors.

4) The staff at Short Leash are always super nice and welcoming, especially the owners Brad and Kat. 

5) Booze! They have a great selection of craft beers and they also have local AZ wines on tap. The truck was great on its own, but now that I can have a beer with my hot dog, it's just that much better.

6) Brunch! You might be wondering how a hot dog could possibly taste good at breakfast. I'm not quiet sure either, but Short Leash has found the secret, and it is damn delicious.

At this point, I don't know why you are still reading this and not at Short Leash!"}
{"text":"Found this place on uber eats... we are from California and always like to try places we don't normally get back at home.

I ordered bakers dozen($21) which with fees set me back 26 bucks. Not a problem, these were supposed to be some pretty amazing hipster donuts.

I have 3 lids 11, 9 and 4. Once a week they get to indulge in donuts, they were super excited to get 2 boxes of donuts to choose from.

The donuts are huge! We decided it would be best to cut the donuts in pieces so they can try all or most of the ones they wanted.

I took one bite and it was cold, hard and had zero flavor. I didn't say anything out loud so as to not ruin the experience for my kids, my 4 year old tasted 1 put it down tasted 2 more and didn't finish any of the pieces,  turns to me and says \" mooom, why did you get these gross donuts?\" She tried almost all of them and did not like one of them. The 14, 11 and 9 year old took bites of a few but tossed them in the trash and decided to eat some left over brownies that were made 2 days earlier. 

I stopped trying after donut 4, since they didnt seem to be getting any better.

In a house of 9 people, all ready to eat donuts with thier coffe or tea I came back to california with 3 whole donuts and 1/2's or 1/4's of all the rest, majority of them went into the trash.

These donuts came home to my mom who is a very non compliant diabetic who gorges on donuts most of the week and she tried one and said \"why did you bring these home, are they for the dog?\"

Based on the cold, hard, stale tasting donuts I received I wouldn't recommend or return to this donut spot."}
{"text":"Cool concept putting a twist on hotdogs.  Ordered a moki. Instead of a traditional bun they used Greek flat/pita bread. The type that would typically be used to rap up a gyro.  That was cool! But bread wasn't fresh or even warmed/toasted.  Toppings were all fresh/delicious. My biggest problem was with the hot dog itself.  I like my hotdogs cooked/grilled well - grill lines and smokey and swollen on the outside and juicy on the inside. This one seemed like it was barely on the grill or maybe even boiled :( if I ever go again I'll be sure to give special instructions about cooking it for longer. 
Also ordered a $3 dollar side of fries that was super disappointing. Thought I'd get something special/eclectic. Nope. It was previously frozen thin cut fries w a little black pepper sprinkled on.  And I got less than a handful. Do not get fries as a side."}
{"text":"I visited with some friends and one of the servers had an attitude whilst serving us. He got food and drinks wrong, but didn't really seem to care that it impacted our experience. An email to the owners proved this business cares about its customers and their experiences. I would not hesitate to return again.

Food is really good and you should try this place."}
{"text":"The service and food was awesome. I looked up the best top ten restaurants in Phoenix for a quick lunch before I flew out! It was exceptional and well worth the trip! :)"}
{"text":"I'm afraid to try many of the other fun looking dogs here, but I must say that the Chicago dog is quite tasty. I love that style of a hot dog. The \"bun\" is interesting on these because it's more like a wrap kind of. Maybe like naan bread? The fried pickles from when I had their food truck were great too. I think they use sweet pickles though rather than regular pickles."}
{"text":"Really love the concept, however the execution could be improved. The venue has plenty of seating. The space is shared between donuts and hot dogs. I came for the hot dogs. Looking at the menu alone, there are SO many options. A lot of combinations and flavors offered. They also have several different kinds of hot dogs offered...including a veggie dog.

I ended up having the chili Mac hot dog with a veggie dog. It was $9 and I had it with a side of fries. I shared it with my partner, and it gave our stomachs enough to be full for 3-4 hours. So why the three stars? For a $9 hot dog - I expected more. The veg chili was okay, the Mac n cheese was good, the pita or as they call it...naan was probably not homemade, AND the veggie dog was for sure store bought (Smart Dog). I'd rather buy a pack of smart dogs and save $10.

Sure, may be worth it for meat eaters. For vegetarians...pass. May come back for cheese curds and beer, but no to the hot dogs."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I've searched high and low for a great hotdog and they don't disappoint here"}
{"text":"Working downtown today and happen to drive by and pulled it up one my phone and great reviews. So stopped by and got the sunny dog and it was the best hot dog I have ever had. The only bad thing I could even say was the pickle was to hot for me but for sure will be back. Ps the staff was very nice"}
{"text":"This place puts a twist on hot dogs. Instead of using a bun they use naan. The taste and texture goes well with the dog. It also nice because it allows room for all the toppings with out them falling off and making a mess. I got the dog with Fritos. It had good balance and Fritos gave it a nice texture with the spicy dog"}
{"text":"Supremely unimpressed!  Waited 10 minutes in a mostly empty restaurant to be waited on and waitress when she finally came over was unapologetic.  Food was incredibly overpriced for what it was - hot dogs - and the donuts were mediocre at best, the bear do it was actually disgusting - the only bright spots was the spicy Thai coconut donut and the fried pickles.  Overall don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"I've been excited about this place from the first time I saw they're \"coming soon\" sign in the window and was even more excited when I finally had a free moment to stop in and check them out earlier this week.
I loved the restaurant! decor and ambiance was great, though not at all what I expected. I was expecting something far more casual. Kind of a order at the counter, it comes in a to go container and be done with it.
No its very nice, decorated modern casual, cool. I sat at the bar, talked with the bartender a bit. I ordered the sausage sliders at his recommendation and they were delicious. 
The reason for a four star review, rather than a five-star one is this:
1. Prices. Sliders (two small sausage sliders and a side salad) $10, glass of wine $8, piece of pie $4.50 (from Mamma Toledo's which is attached to the restaurant) and tip $6. Total bill for 1 person = $30. Did I enjoy myself? Yes, Would I have enjoyed myself even more if it was a few bucks cheaper? Definitely! Hot dogs from the food truck are $6. Here at Sit, Stay they are $8.50 and 9.50. (Yes I understand than in a brick and mortar restaurant, there is much more overhead costs, but I wasn't expecting such a big difference in price.)
2. Pie is on the menu but wasn't available. I had to go to Mamma Toledos to order my pie. As I said previously, it is part of the restaurant, so it's not like its inconvenient to get there or anything, but it means separate bill, separate tip. Just a minor inconvenience over all. Oh and it wasn't air conditioned. 

Would I come here again? Absolutely! And probably frequently. It's in the perfect location for me, barely a block from the light rail.
Though higher than I'd like, the prices won't deter me and I hope they don't deter you."}
{"text":"Super plus that it is dog friendly! Great service! Huge Choice of local brewed beers! And food was great! Fun and friendly!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere has a cool vibe and the bathrooms are super clean! As for the food, I don't eat piggies but the veggie dog is very good. Oh and don't forget to bring a pic of your dog, puppy, pooch:)"}
{"text":"This place is just fun. From the different and varied combinations they throw out there, the flat bread that will make You never want a bun again, to the great sausages this place is a blast. 

I had the bear which had peanut butter, cracker jacks, and BBQ sauce and it was a great hot dog. The tangy BBQ and the peanut butter worked well together and the cracker jacks added some needed texture. 

If your looking for something fun ad delicious I would check out short leash"}
{"text":"Dogs were a bit over hyped IMO. Portillo's being my standard, I thought their meat was good, but their toppings are a bit excessive. I like the pita bread/tortilla idea and it was good, but I suppose it's more of a novelty thing, and I like the traditional bun. Next time I'll try their pretzel dog. I had the Moki, and reminded me of a chili cheese dog.

The thing that bumps them up a half star if i could is their fried pickles. Id come in any day for an order of those bad boys"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the authenticity and creativity in their menu. If you're in the mood for a hotdog, this is the place to go. And don't be afraid to order fried pickles on the dogs, they're delish!"}
{"text":"Sit....Stay and you won't be disappointed. Short Leash takes a great American pass time food, the hot dog, and turns it into a dining experience to not miss out on. Their gourmet style hot dogs will thrill your taste buds in the moment and leave you salivating for more after. I am getting Pavlovian just writing this review. 
The dining atmosphere is cozy, the wait staff is very friendly and knowledgable about their products.  There is a small area for bar seating and several tables for larger groups.  The decor is minimalist which adds to the charm.  There is no outdoor seating which is great for the hot summer months. 
I went with some friends and arrived after walking a mile in the 115 degree afternoon sun. The first we ordered was water and lots of it.  Our server was so nice as to not only leave the pitcher of water but brought out two more.  They were all gone by the time our dinner was done.  And she provide waters in Togo glasses after hearing our story when our meal was done. That was great thoughtfulness. 
My friends who had never experienced the food truck were dazzled by all of the options available for a hot dog so they each chose a create your own.  I ordered the Bear because they didn't believe that bacon and peanut butter with crackers could be delicious on a hot dog.  They were eating their words once they had one bite of the deliciousness.  Dave H. ordered the deviled dog and thought it was the most amazing gourmet dog he'd ever eaten.  
If you have never tried the food truck I recommend trying the restaurant you won't be disappointed.  If you have tried the food truck try the restaurant as there are added delicious treats that await.  Treats like corn dog skewers for appetizer and a delicious key lime pie for dessert. I already have plans to return with more friends."}
{"text":"I normally don't like hot dogs but I figured I would give it a shot and it was amazing! I loved \"The Lady\", it had chipotle sauce and fried pickles on it. Very unique how they use naan bread instead of bun."}
{"text":"I hate to do it, but I had to come back an re-review based on recent unfortunate events. :( 

I really like Short Leash. The food is good and local, the service is great, I love how they've improved the little corner they're on that so desperately needed it.. 

BUT, recently they have been involved in parking wars that have lead to VERY unfair treatment of one of the local non-profit businesses which has been here for more than a decade and serves one of the most critically in-need populations in Phoenix. The treatment and descrimination is very, very disappointing to say the least and I cannot with a clear conscience patronize Short Leash again until the parking issues are fairly resolved."}
{"text":"The Short Leash seems to have taken a downward turn. My wife and I stopped in for a dog and fried green tomatoes. The dogs were excellent. The fried green tomatoes seemed to have been cooked at an earlier time and reheated in the microwave. Needless to say, they were dry and a little hard. The girl who was the bartender, server and cashier (all-in-one) seemed to be more interested in what was going on with her cell phone than taking care of the customers. We had to reorder the fried green tomatoes, as she said we had not done so when we ordered the hot dogs. Put down the damn cell phone and pay attention to the customer's orders. The donuts at one time were the best in town. They are displayed in a main case, and on various plates on the counter. Some of the donuts on the counter plates are not covered (I guess the flies have to eat too). All-in-all I don't think we will be going back, which is a shame because this place used to really be great."}
{"text":"My husband and I are in Phoenix this week for business and tried out Short Leash Hot Dogs at their physical restaurant (\"Short Leash Sit... Stay\") on Roosevelt St. It was absolutely wonderful! We saw the great reviews for both the restaurant and the food truck here on yelp and figured we'd give it a go. I'm so glad we did! Even though we're only here for a few more days, we definitely plan on returning. Walking in the atmosphere was very relaxed and slightly artsy - very cool. We were seated promptly by a very friendly, pleasant employee (I think she was the bartender) and given water before even having to ask for it. Each table was set with a metal basket containing napkins, silverware, flowers, and Uno! The game! Of course, this totally distracted my husband and he became almost more distracted by winning the game than ordering food! 

We each had a drink besides water - I had the Blackberry Cobbler cocktail and he had a locally brewed peach beer from Four Peaks. Both were so good and came out shockingly fast! The cocktail was slightly tart with hints of vanilla and cinnamon and chunks of real raspberry. The beer was sweet-ish and very peachy - just what he likes! I'm not a beer connoisseur so I'm sure that I am describing the taste wrong. I loved that Short Leash takes pride in serving local food/drinks. It introduced us to a brewery that we probably wouldn't have known was here! Now that we know about it (and he loved the beer) we'll probably try out the Four Peaks tasting room!

The food also came came out extremely quickly and was very unique, filling, and delicious! We started out with the fried pickles which ended up being the best we've had. The pickles weren't overly battered and were served VERY quickly with ranch and a delicious concoction they call \"Dragon Sauce\" (order it by the gallon - it is that amazing!). For the main course I had the Vegetarian Lady hot dog with a side salad and the hubs got the Bratwurst Stuffed Pretzel with house made chips.  They both were totally different dishes but each were wonderful in their own way! 

The Vegetarian Lady was a vegetarian dog with chipotle cream cheese, sauteed onions, and fried pickles served on naan. Oh. My. Goodness. This was seriously a magical creation bursting with flavor! I loved the fact that their dogs are served on naan - it definitely makes eating a lot less messy. The side salad it was served with had a delicious house vinaigrette that was bright and flavorful. 

The Bratwurst Stuffed Pretzel was a monster of a meal - a brat slow cooked in local beer and stuck through a round housemade pretzel bun topped with sauerkraut, onions, bacon, Swiss cheese and sweet Bavarian mustard. Wow. The sauerkraut/sweet Bavarian mustard combination was honestly the star of this dish. My husband and I agreed that it was the best sauerkraut we've ever had - I think the sweet Bavarian mustard was what made it amazing! The house made chips were really yummy especially when dipped in the Dragon Sauce. 

Overall, writing this review is making me crave this awesome local eatery! We will definitely go back during our time here in Phoenix and be sad when we return to Kansas City and aren't able to become regulars."}
{"text":"Visited on a Friday night before a Suns game.  I visited with my wife and my 2 year old son.  Seemed to be quite a few families at the restaurant, yet a shortage of high chairs.  Yet, our two year old was able to reach from a normal chair, we're not that high maintenance anyways- this worked, just not ideal.  The menu is fairly large considering they serve various wieners.  What impressed me the most was the beer selection and the pricing, its AWESOME!  The beer lineup is full of crafts beers locally and beyond.  The prices run $3-$6, but most of the beers are offered for $3 or $4.  There was also a decent amount of wine offerings and some on tap (AZ wine).  The food- the food was great, no complaints.  I had the special, which was a sausage of my choice teamed up with some sirloin to pass as a Philly style dog, good stuff.  My wife had the bratwurst sliders and she had no complaints.  

One thing I will note is the service could get slow, not too many servers working, especially on a weekend night.  It is also small, so you might hit a wait.  I say hit the bar, there's about 6-8 spots at the bar.  The atmosphere is modern, moderate volume music and a mixed crowd- couples, families, hipsters and hippies.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Short Leash Dogs Sit Stay Restaurant is a mouthful in every respect - and this place represents all that's right with a new wave of fun, young restaurants in Phoenix. We had the corn dog bits appetizer with spicy mustard and a Devil Dog - with spicy beer hot dog. The food pops! Wonderful! The corn dog bits were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of batter, and the hot dog wrapped in flat bread was an amazing mix of spicy flavors. All the hot dogs on the menu sounded delicious. We will be back. Love the owners mission: \"eating well and surrounding yourself with people who make you happy\" - mission accomplished. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It was okay.  Not horribly bad, not awesomely good.  \"Meh\" about describes it.  My wife is vegetarian.  Not the type who wants a veg meat substitute.  She doesn't like meat period.  The waitress seemed perturbed when my wife asked what was available for her and that she didn't want the veg dog.  Would I go again?  Probably just to get some pie from the Pie Hole next door."}
{"text":"Verdict: unless you're allergic to hot dogs, eat here. 

Ambience:  modern, a little minimalist, and a nice vibe. Small bar on one side with somewhat limited seating. 

Service:  Emily was great, friendly without being overly so. Good attentiveness, and she convinced me to try the Bear dog. 

The bear dog starts out sounding right (hot dog and bacon), but then adds funky stuff:  peanut butter, peanuts, cracker jacks (!)...wrapped in naan instead of a bun?  

Trust her and trust me, get past the menu print and try it. It's kind if like a Thai peanut sauce on your jalape√±o dog, the bacon provides a nice burst, and the naan cuts the flavor nicely. Nothing is overbearing, the presentation is good, and although a tad expensive for a hot dog, we'll worth it. Hey, we never thought we would pay $4 for one cupcake right?

I had a normal salad and water (it was lunch), but this is one of the best casual restaurants I've visited while in Phoenix. Check it out."}
{"text":"Fun concept. The restaurant itself has a clean urban feel. Dog friendly patio. Kid friendly menu. Local beer. Uno on the table. A dog hall of fame in the bathroom hallway. Oh yes. The food is good. If you're a fan of the food truck, you'll love the brick and mortar restaurant.

Our young ones liked the choices on the kids menu. On this visit, one opted for the corn dogs, a pretty filling choice. The other opted for the Frito Pie, messy goodness playfully presented in a Frito chips bag. It was more fun, but not quite as filling. Both were fairly priced at six dollars. The more mature in our group all loved their choices as well, but with the numerous wieners and toppings available, how could you not? Everything under ten bucks. I'm a fan of the Mac Daddy.

I'll confess to not really liking hot dogs. Odd, I know. A childhood farm experience in the Midwest involving older cousins and the making of sausage. No more need be said. Still, Short Leash has won me over. I enjoyed my Mac Daddy beef wiener and the pop it made as I bit into it. Perfectly prepared with the juices preserved. The folks in the kitchen know what they're doing. 

Next visit, I'm bring the Labradoodle and sitting on the patio."}
{"text":"We had a Pretzel Dog and the Poutine Dog. Each hot dog was about $9, but they were both very, very good. We even stopped at the Donut shop located inside. I have to admit, two hot dogs and two soft drinks for $25 bucks+tip will keep me from coming back in on a regular basis. Other than that, I was happy with the service and the food."}
{"text":"Ordered food to go, but still had a great experience in store. After we said we wanted to order our food to go, the waitress still invited us to sit at a table to browse the menu, enjoy some water and wait for our orders to be made. The menu offered a wide variety of dogs, with a choice of different meats and spice-level. Each dog was served on naan (an interesting and delicious bread option for a hot dog). I opted for the Chicago dog, a classic. It was fantastic and served in true chicago style. I chose the chips over the salad (worth it) and got a cheerwine as my drink. They also had many other \"vintage\" soda options. Didn't get dessert, but they had a ton of delicious looking doughnuts. Will be back here at some point to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"We tried going opening day, but decided not to wait the 45 min.  So glad we went back today.  I had the bratwurst Igby and it left my mouth tingling.  Wonderful flavor and crisp.  
We sat at the bar and really enjoyed talking with the staff and other customers.  Everyone was supper nice, and the owners are really a wonderful part of our community."}
{"text":"Having to order at the bar has changed the service. Great job listening and solving a problem."}
{"text":"I liked this joint; good beer, really interesting menu (I had a spicy dog with peanut butter, bacon, and Gouda cheese) fine prices and a really nice waitress. The time of service was lackluster, but we were outside and it was a beautiful day. Cool joint."}
{"text":"I'm always down with hot dogs..................

Decided to come down here to check this place out.  I had read about it on Yelp and it sounded right up my alley.  I grabbed a parking spot about 100 feet away, walked in and took a seat.  I browsed over the menu for a bit and decided to place my order for 2 dogs.  I went with an All Beef \"Lady\" and I went with one of their specialties \"The Bratwurst Stuffed Pretzel\". You get your choice of chips or salad so I chose one of each as my sides.   I had water to drink (they hook you up with a huge jug of water on your table...awesome!)  A few minutes later, my food came out.  Here is how everything shook out.........................

Bratwurst Stuffed Pretzel ($9.50)-  Um....interesting?  This is more of a sandwich type entree instead of a hot dog per say.  A knife and forker for sure.  I dug in and honestly, was not that impressed.  They pile a huge mound of sauerkraut, bacon, onions and mustard onto their pretzel roll.  Somewhere in there was a bratwurst ;-).  This thing was too jumbled and messy.  The bratwurst was super small....reminded me of a breakfast sausage.  It was just decent.  I did not really like their pretzel roll either.  It was too light and airy and I prefer my pretzel breads to be dense and chewy.  It wasn't horrible, but I would never get it again.  

The Lady- ($8.50)-  Winner!  With their regular dogs, you get to choose what kind of tube steak you want.  Regular, All Beef, Bratwurst, Polish, Beer Hot, Veggie or Chicken.  I went with the All Beef.  This \"dog\" (they are served on flat bread...kind of like half naan and half pita...it worked well) came with chipotle cream cheese, fried pickles and sauteed onions.  An odd combo but I'll be damned if it didn't work perfectly.  The dog itself snapped when you bit in, had great flavor and was rather large.  The chipotle cream cheese was damn spicy and it melted down into a sauce like consistency.  The fried pickles were perfect and the onions were plentiful.  The whole combo of flavors worked well.  If I ever come back, I would get this again.  It was a really really good dog.  They give you some homemade potato chips too.  They were pretty darn delicious.  It's a decent sized portion too.

Service was excellent!  The 2 ladies that helped me out were super friendly and all smiles.  

3 stars because of two things.  The price was ridiculous.  $18.00 for 2 hot dogs is nuts.  I could go to my favorite hot dog joint, get 3 sausages, a drink and fries for around $16 bucks.  This meal was JUST 2 dogs.  My Andrew Jackson frowned when I told him what he was being exchanged for.  The other reason was that the Bratwurst dog just wasn't impressive.   The \"Lady\" dog on the other hand, was excellent.  If I had just gotten that by itself, I might rate this a star higher.  Cool concept and extremely friendly staff....just too dang expensive for my taste!"}
{"text":"\"It's a hot dog... with BBQ... wrapped in naan... covered in crackerjacks... and peanut butter... and cheese. Also, doughnuts. No, I'm not kidding.\" 

So that's how we decided on Mother's Day brunch. 

Two bratwurst Bears, a Sunny, and a Lady later, we were full, but not quitting. Sunny (prosciutto, greens, honey, goat cheese, good times) was a favorite, but I was intrigued by the promise of crackerjacks on the Bear. 'Twas so filling. 

Speaking of fillings, the custard-filled coffee cake doughnut is stonery-brilliant-phenomenal and the spicy Thai doughnut is pleasant-aromatic-exotic. If you like your doughnuts how you like your men, these fit the bill... but if you like your doughnuts how you like your hot dogs, the Bear also comes in doughnut form. 

Nothing was a miss, but the Sunny and coffee cake doughnut would be my top picks in future. Overall, this place successfully made naan-believing wiener-eaters out of us."}
{"text":"Another great experience, sat at the bar and enjoyed my crispy dog day!  Chips and a refreshing birch beer rounded a great lunch out.  Yummy food and great service, love Short Leash!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place. I never ate at the food truck, but we've been coming to the restaurant for several years - it's our tradition after one of us gets a new tattoo! Otherwise we don't typically drive to this part of town.

Anyways, it was amazing with waiters coming to the table, and now it's a walk-up counter and I hated it, but they've renovated recently and I think it's awesome again! The donuts are delish, and I'm totally in love with the dogs!

My favorite is the \"Sunny\" with pear and prosciutto. And even though the naan is unbelievable, now I get it \"naked\" and they cut it up over a salad, which is delicious! 

Basically - this place is super fun. Doesn't take itself too seriously, and even though it's not super fancy, it's awesome food with pretty gourmet flavors IMO."}
{"text":"I travel a lot for work and this is one of the few places I visited twice. This place was cool, fun, and had some masterminds in the back. The dogs were amazing. I had the bear and the Aiko with bacon added. Didn't get a chance to try the donuts, but will definitely come back if I'm ever in Arizona."}
{"text":"What a cute little place! I've had the good fortune of eating Short Leash Hot Dogs before. Excited I finally have a place to write a review.

+ Dedicated parking rocks
+ Incredible selection of beer
+ The food (come on!)

Bowing to peer pressure (Thanks Deb. V.) we shared the Fried Green Tomatoes. Battered heaven here, layered with avocado, and sprinkled with a heavenly amount of corn, bacon (BACON) and a blue cheese dressing. (The dressing was lighter than I expected. Don't say no if you're anti blue cheese. I really thought it was a creamy buttermilk or ranch. But no!)

I wanted to lick the plate.
Yeah, that good.

Stuffed to the gills (with the beer I just had to have - $3 for craft beer!) I had flipped my menu to the back and selected the \"Devil Dog\". Ordered without naan (the dogs are served on a hearty size of naan) I was offered a side salad or chips. Spicy and delicious with roasted red peppers, green chiles, sriracha, saut√©ed onions, cheddar cheese & jalape√±os. Happy times. (Even tho I couldn't eat the whole thing! Perfect when re-heated for breakfast.)

The side salad was refreshing. I'd do that again as well.

Deb. V. was trying to kill me. We shared a sweet treat served with ice cream. (I can't find it on their online menu.) Suffice it to say IT WAS GOOD. I was very tempted by the concept of a BEER Float. I'll have to return to try that.

Things I've eaten on other occasions:
+ The Bear dog
+ Corn Dog Bites
+ Jalapeno poppers
(Eat any of those and you'll be happy.)

Emily was the bomb helping feed us. Super, super sweet!

Oh! And note: The temperature can be a tad warm inside. The ovens apparently heat this gem of a place up. Just don't show in your birthday suit :)"}
{"text":"This is a cool spot downtown with a casual hip vibe. Staff are very friendly and helpful. I'm personally not a real hot dog connoisseur but a friend wanted to meet here to talk some business. They do have vegetarian options with a veggie dog or salads which is always a plus since I'm vegetarian by marriage. ;).  Also have the most creative dog options I've ever seen."}
{"text":"Amazing hot dogs, amazing donuts, and, oh, those wonderful fried pickles. I've tasted most of the menu and everything has been great, if not downright wonderful!"}
{"text":"The food is okay. The service is actually really great. It's actually really fabulous apparently. So fabulous that their staff decides how much they think they deserve as a tip. I wrote down a one dollar tip on a tab for one beer. When it cleared in my account, another two dollars was added on. Apparently our bartender felt she deserved a three dollar tip on one beer. Incredibly inappropriate. I most definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"If I could marry the Short Leash Hot Dogs I would. Of course like all great love stories it wasn't love at first bite. I got that strange dog with caramel corn in it that my friends love with a brat. It was too weird!!! I'm sorry! But the second time I got the Mac Daddy and it was like something clicked. Service can be a bit slow but relax people. The servers are working hard and they also happen to be some of the coolest people. Haha People who say the dogs are pricey don't understand the value of love. I also hate sweet pickles. But the fried pickles were bomb! Give it a try! Meet some cool people have a yummy meal for once in your life.

OH! and HOLY crap is the brunch on weekends good. I will never be the same."}
{"text":"This is our third time at short leash. Our first experience was really good but they seem to be getting progressively worse.  First of all there was little customer service, unlike any time previous we were told by our server that we had to walk up and order ourselves. We ordered the chili dogs. It used to be they give you complementary chips with your order, this time we had to pay for a side. The chili dogs were delivered promptly but the chili was still cold. Over all we were a little disappointed that a place we initially enjoyed has seemingly gone down hill a little bit."}
{"text":"This is my third visit to this location.  I liked the close parking to the back door.  I enjoyed \"The Bear\" hotdog on my first visit without Cracker Jack's, it was sensational.  It was a spicy beef iiyye weFrank that was in a home made tortilla bread.  
On my second trip, I order a Chicago Dog on a pretzel bun.  It wasb bc coming coming in into  good, but a little  e to chewy for me.  At closing I was given a bag  bc c we the doughnuts.  That was the last thing I needed, being that my diet doesn't permit such delicacies.  Yet,. I took them anyway and enjoyed a late not sugar snack to die for."}
{"text":"I asked the cashier what was the most popular item. She pointed to something called \"the bear.\" It was a bizarre concoction of peanut butter, hot dog, caramel popcorn, BBQ sauce, bacon, smoked gouda, and a pita \"bun.\"  This was a risky decision for an adventurous eater. It sounded awful to me but \"living in the moment\" got the better of me.  The first few bites were interesting. After a while, I concluded that the cashier played a cruel joke on me. I left the dog half eaten because I thought I was going to ralph. The saving grace was an ice cold diet coke."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am a big fan of Short Leash food truck and have been going to it for years. I hadn't made it to the restaurant for whatever reason for a long time, but last Friday (first Friday) I finally went here with the Husband and a friend. Unfortunately, it just didn't stand up to the truck. We sat at the little counter outside that overlooks Roosevelt, which was nice, good for people watching. We ordered our hot dogs and I asked for a drink menu to look over.... well I waited, and waited, and waited and the waitress didn't come back to take a drink order. Someone else delivered our hotdogs... still no waitress to be seen. This brings me to another problem... we had no silverware. I had to eat my side salad with the toothpick that came in the hotdog.... not cool. Meanwhile, my hotdog (the bear) which I have had several times, was not as good as it typically is.... they slathered it in sauce but put barely any popcorn or bacon or cheese on... I don't know, it just wasn't very good. It also wasn't very hot. The salad tasted like it wasn't dressed. It was bland. When I was halfway done with the hotdog we finally were able to wave down the waitress to ask for a drink. Their drinks are well priced, with beer for 3$. Anyway, I gave them 3 stars because I think maybe it just was a bad night to go, being first Friday and all, but I hope they step it up, because this was not what I expected from this place."}
{"text":"This place was a great environment and had really fun twists on hot dogs! Definitely looking forward to going back! I was bummed that the pies had either coconut or banana in them because they all looked amazing!! Looks like I need to learn to like bananas and coconut...ha!"}
{"text":"Still going strong.  Just learned they will do 'naked' dogs without the Naan for no carbers or gluten free people.  I could eat a naked Igby every single day. SOOO good."}
{"text":"3rd time here and every time we try a different dog. The flavors are ridiculously good. It always surprises me how creative they are. Plus the naan, is delicious as well. Definitely going back and of course trying something new."}
{"text":"I've been a patron of Brad's and Kat's for about three years, starting with, of course, the food truck. They've always been supportive of me, so naturally I had to have dinner at the brick-and-mortar.
I love this place. I love the industrial decor. It's simple.
My boyfriend loves the fried pickles.
The different pop flavors are also something different, that you wouldn't get at many places.
And how can you not love a hot dog place attached to a pie place??? ONLY A CRAZY PERSON wouldn't fall in love with that concept.
I'm so glad business has been good for Brad & Kat, because these guys really deserve their success. :)"}
{"text":"Short Leash caught my eye for the naan/pita like bun. Only in the southwest would this make any sense. 

I had the Mac Daddy which consisted of mac n cheese and vegetable chili. The ingredients were tasty and clean. There was no oil, grease or butter overkill. The naan was warm and soft. The sausage was good too. 

Their drink selection is far better than I would of expected. Regional beers in the high numbers and who can say to no to a big red? 

Dessert: I need Anne Robinson to tell them that this is their weakest link. The strawberry cheesecake doughnut tasted imported..imported from Tim Horton's that is. Bad Bad Bad.

Service was clean just like their dogs.

I love businesses that can put a twist on things the way that Short Leash has. A worthy stop for anyone to make. And if you're one of those people that skips dessert, for once I won't consider you stingy."}
{"text":"It seemed like a nice place.  Phoenix PD was eating there, and that's usually a good sign.  However, we waited 10 minutes to have our drink order taken, at which time we decided to flag down one of the two wait staff who had a whopping two other tables to serve.  We ordered our drinks and meal at the same time since we were 1) already done looking at the menu and 2) on our lunch break.  When the food finally came out, the appetizer we ordered came WITH The meal, the salad I ordered as the side with my hot dog looked suspiciously like potato chips, and all three dishes (two meals and an appetizer) were completely lacking any seasoning (including the chips).  There was no salt or pepper on the table, and given the service to this point, I had no confidence we would get it, so didn't even bother to ask.  I did, however, ask for some ketchup to help with the cardboard-tasting chips problem, and the waitress brought  2 TEASPOONS of ketchup in a dipping container.  

The food probably ranks a 3 - original combinations, but the execution was terrible. Service is a 0, therefore, 1 star it is.  I, personally, will not be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in for coffee and a donut before a conference we were in town for. I'm a donut connoisseur and I must say the apple fritter and maple/bacon donuts were incredible. I had to use all of my self control not to order 10 more!"}
{"text":"The hot dogs were okay but I didn't think they were phenomenal.  They are served on house made naan bread which served as an excellent vehicle to hold the dog plus all the toppings without breaking or dissolving.  Wide selection of canned beers.  Good place for kids."}
{"text":"Out of 4 donuts,  1 tasted like it was 3 days old and really stale, 1 tasted like it was 2 days old and starting to get a bit dry, the other 2 tasted like they were a day old...not fresh but still soft enough to pass as decent. For a place that has donuts in it's name, you should have super fresh donuts made every 3 hours. This stuff was not fresh and if it wasn't for the friendly service I would have left a 1 star review."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, I tried the Short Leash Dogs food truck at a the first play date at the Children's Museum. I've longed to get back to them again since that time.  I finally did and I absolutely loved it! I love the naan for a bun and the kettle chips were amazing! I had an extremely difficult time trying to choose which thing to try, everything looked yummy!  I can't wait to try more of the menu, next time!"}
{"text":"\"The noblest of all dogs is the hot-dog; it feeds the hand that bites it. \" - Lawrence J. Peter.

After having Short Leash numerous times at events around the valley, I finally gotten around to visiting their place and boy am I full!  Strolled in today after a dramatic parking adventure with Linh L. and we ordered a delicious meal.  Between the two of us, we had a root beer, a ginger ale, corn dog bites, the Igby, and the Sunny.  Our bill came out to about $30 before tip for the both of us.  Admittedly, it's a bit of a splurge for wieners on naan bread but hey, it's Friday, I paid my student loans, and I wanted some good eats.  It's always good eats with Short Leash!  The Bear caught my eye but I was thinking I wanted something with some greens.  That Sunny... pure bliss.  It had pear with some honey, prosciutto, goat cheese, arugula, cracked black pepper, with a chicken wiener on fluffy warm naan bread.  Savory-sweet [with a hint of bitterness from the arugula]  wins me over every time.  I think it's more than just puppy love...

Other yummy items that have crossed these lips:  The Bear, Mac Daddy, fried pickles, jalapeno poppers, the pimento cheese dip, and the brat-stuffed pretzel.  Yum!  Try to save room for their dessert items.  If I didn't feel like passing out right on the spot from that food coma, I would have loved to split the orange-glazed and pistachio doughnut or the maple and candied bacon.  Gimme gimme!  More reason to arrange lunch again with some friends, right?"}
{"text":"YALL THESE DONUTS ARE SO GOOD. I got the chocolate w sprinkles and the chocolate glaze is the perfect consistency (not too thick and icing like) and the flavor of the dough is so perfect. I live 15 steps away and will probably come here way too often for donuts. Since they are hand made, you have to go early or else they will sell out for the rest of the day!!! I think they are priced a little high, but DTPHX it's not unusual for smaller businesses to have higher than norm prices."}
{"text":"Small space with a big patio- 
Great food, unique menu, and friendly service.
Tasty!
Highly recommend stopping in for lunch or dinner.
It's great to see a start up from a food truck doing so good. 
Can't wait to try their dessert next time"}
{"text":"The selection of beer is huge and very reasonably priced. The food was quite spicy and delicious, so if that's what you're after you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"There isn't single negative thing to say about Short Leash. I'm not a hot dog fan, but I will come here any day. The choices to make your own are limitless... flavorful every single time."}
{"text":"So happy they finally have a brick-and-mortar location! The atmosphere is nice and inviting and the service can be a little slow even if it's not busy. The Aiko is by far my favourite choice and usually pair it with the chicken, or spicy beer hot. If you're looking for a great hot dog, this is the place to go. I've also tried other menu items and have been pleased as well. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I guess I just don't get this place. Why would you pay top dollar for a good but not great hot dog? Heck, if you want a hot dog like they serve at this place, their food truck is a somewhat more reasonably priced option. And if you can get to Tempe, you can get a better hot dog for half the price at Ted's. I guess this is a hipster place, and if you are not a hipster, it is not for you."}
{"text":"So I am usually short leash's number one fan but I had to share this outrageous experience I had today. I ordered food on Grubhub as usual to deliver to my apartment. Keep in mind that my apartment is two blocks away from this place at most. On Grub hub they have short leash and rollover listed as two separate restaurants, so you cant order them at the same time. So as soon as I put in my order for my hot dogs, I called short leash immediately and asked if I could place an order for doughnuts and I would pay for them in cash so they could bring both orders at the same time. The evil girl on the phone (who sounded miserable with her life) told me no and that I would have to go back on the app and order it separate. She then proceeded to tell me that they would make sure both orders were delivered together (after I expressed that I didn't want to put them through the trouble of having to come here twice). Next thing I knew, my hot dogs were delivered and there were no donuts. Before I could even call them, I received a phone call from grub hub telling me that the restaurant had cancelled my order because \"they had no donuts left.\" So being the detective that I am, I had my boyfriend call rollover doughnuts and ask what donuts they had left for the day, and the girl (miserable as usual) read off numerous donuts they had left. Therefore they basically cancelled my order because they didn't want to bring them, after I had tried to make it easier for them, and they blatantly lied and lost my service due to being lazy. It's sad because the food there is so good and I've been such a huge customer and big fan. Shame on this place and the terrible employees."}
{"text":"This is really good place to stop by and get something to eat. Servings are pretty good sized. Loved the cream soda. Music is pretty cool too."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Dirty Franks in Columbus. The way they put together a hot dog is creative and delicious..it's all about the right proportion and they did it well here. 

Service was quick and the place wasn't crowded for lunch. Chill atmosphere and good food."}
{"text":"Do not be put off my this being \"only\" a hot dog place! This is NOT an ordinary hot dog joint! You get your choice of link (from vegan to sausage to all beef & more), all served on warm fresh naan bread with an unexpected selection of topping combos (peanut butter, anyone?) with your choice of crispy peppery home chips or delicious salad of baby greens with pears & viniagrette. Have converted many a skeptic that Short Leash Hot Dogs is an AWESOME place to grab a meal downtown!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I went here on thurs the 22 of May after a long day at the children's museum downtown.  What a awesome little place.  I had the German type dog with amazing mustard and sauerkraut.  It came with the freshest, tastiest little salad.  My daughter had the kids hot dog, she loved the pita bread bun.  We  had a great time.  As a bonus the waitress/bartender who was the only one working went out of her way to interact with my 3 year old.  It was around 4 I think and we were the only ones there, the food came out exceedingly fast and fresh.  One slight negative that didn't effect our meal.  The outside patio had the strong smell of liquid gasoline because 2 of their food trucks were parked in the driveway.  I was going to sit out there but the smell was strong as soon as I opened the door, so we sat inside.  Oh yeah the chips are amazing!"}
{"text":"Not the biggest lover of hotdogs, unless it is an Italian sausage with extra spice and or a Sabarette in NYC, I find myself contemplating why I have been wanting to go here for like, well, forever! Okay, at least as long as they opened their non food truck restaurant. It all started at the Neil Gaiman book signing. I am sure he is thrilled to be associated with this new addiction to food truck love. lol. I heard all about Short Leash from my downtown working and Food Truck Foodie friends. Then of course I have to continue to hear about it from all my Yelpie buddies. \"Afterwards, The Joy!\" They actually open a restaurant. I continue to hear all about it as if people were just rubbing it into my face on purpose. Okay, then what? They joined up with Momma Toledo's Pies too? The horror! Looks like a visit is a must. Finally, they are at the Downtown Revival and dare to not even serve any hotdogs. WHAT? What's up with that? ( In my best SNL singing voice) However, redemption is close by since they offer me and my Foodie Buddy this Fried Green Tomato dish with corn and bacon and a very mild Blue Cheese dressing. It was the most Delish, surprising,\"twist treat\" of the entire night. (And I hate Blue Cheese) Okay, I am convinced. I promise to go visit their permanent location now.

I swing by today after an appointment in the neighborhood. (And to digress, how much do I adore Roosevelt Row? ) I ordered the FGTs of course, again. However, I now have a foodie dilemma. This item is listed as a salad not an App.It is a meal in itself. I was hoping it would be just a small plate App so I could get a dog too. I decide to get both anyway and split the meal as leftovers for tomorrow. I can not see any way out of it. I had to have the FGTs. I dream of those FGTs! lol. I decide to get the pretzel dog too. I am still not brave enough to get the Cracker Jack and Peanut Butter one just yet, although I hear it is \"to die\" for. Maybe next time. I tell the server that she can bring a box since I will have half now and half for lunch tomorrow. Wishful thinking. Out comes this huge monstrosity of a hot dog smothered in Sauerkraut. I start eating. About half way done I am stuffed. I then look inside the box and did not notice the waitress had already split the meal for me. How sweet of her but seriously? More food. What is on my plate was only half of the dog?YIKES! So instead of two meals I got more like four out of it all. 

Anyway, the food was great and the service even better. I had a revelation on the drive home. ( Not a surprising one) I am still not a huge hotdog fan, just saying. However, with Short Leash, who knows? It could happen. I most certainly am a new Short Leash and FGTs fan for life now. ;) If you like dogs check it out. I read they even have a Veggie option. Hmmmm, that sounds weird but I heard it is good. 

See you next time Short Leash. Maybe with a four legged patio dining companion. Did I mention I like the Fried Green tomatoes?"}
{"text":"I have always been a huge fan of Short Leash Dogs.  I just recently had dinner there with a close friend. The \"Brick and Mortar\" Short Leash dogs is located in the historic artsy Roosevelt District with all of its eclectic shops and gallerias and beautiful murals on buildings sprinkled around the district. 

I have traditionally ordered the Bear Hot Dog at SLD.  It has been my staple.  When you look at the ingredients, you think... \"Who puts peanut butter, bacon and cracker jacks on a hot dog\"?  But once you give it a try, you realize, these flavors are amazing together.  I usually enjoy the fried pickles, however the last batch (see below) were a bit different and not as appetizing.

On my most recent visit, I went off script and tried the Bacon Wrapped Chedder Brat with the warm potato salad.  This was a bit of a let down.  I didn't care very much for the brat because the skin was a little thick and the taste wasn't there for me.  I definitely disliked the warm potato salad for many reasons, starting with the fact that it seems like a saucy-soupy mess. If I had known it would be so saucy, I would have passed.  There was a kid in the bunch, so we ordered a Strawberry donut.  The young child took one bite of the donut and said \"Bleh\" and pointed to her tongue.  YIKES.  Maybe those donuts are for adults only?  

I had to kick them down a notch for the last meal.  Albeit, this is one of my favorite places to dine in Phoenix and I will definitely be returning.

{"text":"We were the only other people in the restaurant and the service was slow and horrible. It took about 25 mins to get a hotdog and fries. It seemed like the coworkers were just sitting around talking. There was only one employee that actually asked us how we were doing about 25 minutes of just sitting there without our food."}
{"text":"Delicious hot dogs. We have been following Short Leash around since we first came across it. They had just started out as a food truck and were selling food at a beer festival a few years ago. The owner would make us our hot dogs and knew us by name. Not only is the food delicious but the customer service has and is always great.

This place is definitely a favorite.

All I have to say is that it's rated as one of the best places to eat in Phoenix for a reason. You cannot go wrong with the infamous Bear."}
