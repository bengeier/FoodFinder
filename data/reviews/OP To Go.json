{"text":"Gave this place two stars because I don't feel it is necessary to make someone wait 20 minutes for a soggy 8.00 chicken wrap.  I was really looking forward to this place and had been wanting to try it and now that I have I can say I won't be returning.   I got the satay chicken Vietnamese sandwich on a wrap, I do not like the chicken, I was not expecting it to look the way it did. There seemed to only be one sauce on the wrap which was very runny and there was way too much of it which made the whole thing soggy and very messy to try and eat.  They also served a lot of people who came in after me and ordered as well which is irritating when you're already waiting twenty minutes.  I won't be returning, definitely not worth the wait or the money."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and the restaurant itself has a very modern feel. However if you want to satisfy your pho cravings this is not the ideal place to visit. Extremely pricey for small portions of food..."}
{"text":"$8 veggie salad rolls? No thanks. And why did it take 15 mins to make? In a city full of amazing Vietnamese cuisine this place is sub par. My husband ordered the bahn mi. It was crazy small and didn't even have any chilies. It also was $8. This place is over priced for the basic and unauthentic food it provides."}
{"text":"First of all, yo Yelpers, this place is not fast food joint. It is a Gourmet Vietnamese Bistro which prepares your food fresh to order. So, if you expect to get your \"mush\" in a rush, I highly suggest calling ahead. The staff here is courteous and accommodating that you won't have a problem picking up your delicious and hot food to go. Second, I am an avid fanatic of this uber yummy, awesome reinventions of traditional Vietnamese cuisine -- with an urban twist so it's chic and oh la la, so GOOD.  As a self-confessed purveyor of all things delightfully delish, I think that the grilled pork vermicelli is Da BOMB and cannot be beat! try even the awesome wonton soup or hey, go lighter with a veggie Banh mi - this place doesn't disappoint and always gives me the bang for hard-earned buck.  Lastly, did you check the ambience? Super cool and chic, nothing else like it in the entire city! See ya in the next table soon!"}
{"text":"So incredibly disappointing! As a vegetarian the Vietnamese sub is always appealing. Unfortunately the vegetarian banh mi I had was by far the worst I've ever had, specifically the tofu wasn't cooked or flavoured and the bun was terrible. Maybe a one off by my friend ordered the chicken sub which she said was \"eatable\" but not something she would pay for.  The vermicelli noddle soup was ok but somewhat light on the vegetables and flavour - fine if you are in a pinch.   I think we have some great Vietnamese restaurants, OPTO adds nothing to the 4th st food scene as a gourmet bistro or as a fast food option.   For the positive - it is a clean, bright space and the food is fairly priced. Although I would not pay anything for vegetarian sub."}
{"text":"Horrible! I would be embarrassed as an owner to call this place a Vietnamese restaurant. Chicken Pho consisted of noodles, hot water, green onions, and thawed out slices of chicken. No seasoned broth, no sprouts, no lime, no hoisin. A bottle of Sriracha and soy sauce on the counter next to the cheap chopsticks and plastic spoons was the only thing available to give taste to the meal. We left after trying a few bites and were completely unsatisfied. We were the only customers dining in during the lunch hour and we now know why."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Bahn Mi (sub) was served on an extremely small, stale baguette. Lacked flavour and shrimp tasted 'off'. Salad rolls were SO overpriced. As mentioned below, $8 for 2 salad rolls?! Never again. Also, the ice cream is $4 for one scoop, served in a plastic container.  Such a shame this restaurant is a bust, because the location is perfect."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the spring rolls at this Vietnamese place on 4th Street. They have several seats to sit and have your lunch in a bright space. I haven't tried anything but the spring rolls, but I plan to return very soon."}
{"text":"So based of first impression, the nice mellow and laid back decor on the inside gives a nice ambiance atmosphere, the place is super clean and well maintained. Now on to the more important part, the food! See, the thing is, being Vietnamese, you can't really say that other people's cooking is better than at home you feel me fellow Viets/Asians (no discrimination intended) the banh mi is quite different from what I'm used to, it's different, like hmmm a twist too much? Like tomatoes and salad in a banh mi? Nay nay. The bread is alright but I wouldn't say it gives you the bang for your buck. The pho? Oh buddy, it's different, not saying that it's bad, just different, not fond of it personally, I get a smack with curry powder within the soup base, the noodles are on point though! And lastly I finished my meal with iced coffee and ice cream. The coffee gave me the authentic Vietnamese kick and it was great! The ice cream had great variety and was lovely to devour :) great staff and service too!"}
{"text":"You know.... I was excited for Op to go mainly because it is in very close proximity to my work but also because I got a thing for some good Vietnamese.  I cannot go into detail on their other items because I have only tried the \"rice wrappers\" (the shrimp and chicken) which are their version of salad rolls.   The rolls are not too bad, but definitely not true to traditional ones if that's what your after, also two will set you back $8.   I've never sat inside the restaurant, don't plan on doing so either."}
{"text":"Simply the worst Bahn mi I've ever had.  Wrong bun, no chili, tiny and 8 bucks.  barf"}
{"text":"I had a coupon for $5 off a combo at Op To Go that expired at the end of the month. With that I hand, I felt incentivized to visit for the first time since this location opened up near my neighbourhood.  I ordered a grilled pork vermicelli bowl with sate chicken rice wrappers.  Pros: good location, nice clean interior, generous serving of meat in the vermincelli.  Cons: the meat was very rubbery and, even with the coupon, the meal came to $16 plus tax, an amount far higher than comparable Vietnamese restaurants.  If Op To Go offered a better quality meal than the dozens of other Vietnamese restaurants in the city, I could forgive them their high prices. For the mediocre quality of food, though, there is no excuse. I'll continue giving my business to other restaurants, even if it means driving a bit further."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy!  I love the won ton soup here!  Very flavorful broth and light noodles. This is my go to meal when I'm feeling a little under the weather. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Tasty Vietnamese food and a really nice atmosphere for a quick bite. Tried the satay beef noodle soup which was delicious - my only complaint would be that it didn't come with any basil which I usually love in my pho. Also tried the beef, pork and shrimp vermicelli bowl which was great. The meat had a nice grilled flavour. And the salad rolls came with a tasty dipping sauce. The restaurant is bright and clean and the staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"The place was empty when we walked in during lunch, first red flag. I ask the employee what the \"Curry Chicken\" dish includes and she doesn't give me any details besides \"chicken, some veggies and stuff like that\", red flag number two. I go to use the hoisin sauce and find it to be extremely watered down, red flag number three. The dish was awful. Dry thawed chicken with undercooked rice and randoms veggies thrown into a dish and called \"Curry Chicken\" how is that curry chicken? don't believe me? then order the dish yourself. Believe me? good, now avoid this place at all costs until a new establishment opens OR until they IMPROVE THE FOOD."}
{"text":"This place to fast food to be called Vietnamese. I will say it is very clean but the flavour of the food is just not there .. It is a good try but I will not be returning unless I am extremely hungry."}
{"text":"Food was quick, fresh and delishious and the staff were super friendly.  What more can you want??  I would def eat here again, it is not a cheap place however.. Was $30 for 2 of us and we drank water...."}
{"text":"This place has excellent, fresh food and I disagree with most of their reviews so far. The eight dollar deal with soup and a wrap or sub is not only cheap, but fresh, filling and delicious. Friendly staff. My wait is never more than five to ten minutes."}
