{"text":"Rego's Pizza is one of the best crusts in the area. I really enjoy the flavors and wide range of.menu items. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Super little place! Tasty antipasto salad with all the good stuff, chilled to perfection. Pizza was very tasty with nice crisp crust. I had the all you can eat spaghetti and meatballs, and one generous plate did it for me.  Sauce seemed authentic and long simmered like home. Meatballs were homemade perfection! Service by 1 hard working waitress was stellar!
This is not a fancy place however the welcome was warm and food above average. Lots of take out dinners while we were there, too. Bonus was visiting with neighborhood folks and they secretly bought our dinner! Welcome to Ohio 
Thanks Yelp for helping us find little out of the way places as we travel cross country, great way to connect with local community and support small businesses."}
{"text":"Mine and my fiances first time here. The food was delicious and tasted home cooked. The prices are decent yet affordable enough for a future date night. I would compare this place to a small town version of Olive Garden. We will definitely be back soon when we have the cash for a night out."}

My pizza showed up 2 hours after I ordered it and 25 minutes after I cancelled my order.

Full story:

I orded a pizza at 4:30 this afternoon and was given a 20-25 minute time on my pizza.  After 45 minutes I called to get a status.  I was told the delivery person had just left.  I waited another 45 minutes and called back.  The delivery person had just left (again?).  I canceled my order and went to my favorite pizza place.  As my pizza was being brought out I received a call.  I debated, and then called back.  Rego's was calling me to let me know that my pizza was being delivered and no one was there.  This was a total of almost 2 hours after I placed my order and 25 minutes after I cancelled it.  When I gave that as a response I was yelled at by the person on the phone.  I can't tell you how much I will never order pizza there, that was the worst customer service ever."}
{"text":"Had a private family party at Rego's last night in the upstairs party room. The service and special menu were outstanding, can't say enough how pleased everyone was. A must try."}
{"text":"Really great stuff. The best pizza in town!! Huge portions great salads great prices! Super fast delivery. I wish I knew about this place sooner. I order at least once a week!! Yummy!!"}
{"text":"I worked with James at Rego's to order food for my father's funeral.   The food was good quality and arrived at the church on time as promised.  We 
Ordered a couple trays of rigatoni, several sheet pizzas, salad, chicken tenders.  I felt the bill was very reasonable for what we got.  Thanks Hanks James."}
