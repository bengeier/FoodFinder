{"text":"Basically the upstairs area of Apiecalypse now. Order your food downstairs and ask them to bring it upstairs. More seats and overall better dining experience. Food wise check out reviews for Apiecalapse now. But basically they are mainly famous for pizza. Their corn dog is pretty good. Their \"wings\" are tempeh dipped in a sweet sauce, while their nuggets are fried and salted tofu. Stick to beer & pizza if you ask me!

Overall I love this place, best vegan pizza I ever had!"}
{"text":"Fubar isn't totally set up yet, so bear it mind things will only get better!

Fubar is a bar located above Apiecalypse Now.  In order to get it, you must go up a flight of stairs, meaning the bar is physically inaccessible.  The menu consists of the vegan food offered at Apiecaplypse Now and vegan beers upstairs.  The bathroom upstairs is non-gendered.

I LOVE being able to order vegan food and beer at the same time.  The beer selection is excellent and is only going to get better.  There's nothing better than eating a nice piece of vegan pizza with a vegan doughnut and a vegan beer with a beautiful view of the park.  This place is going to get SOOOO full in the summer!  In case you haven't realized, this place is awesome!  

I'd LOVE if FuBar started offering mixed drinks too, but one thing at at time.  They JUST opened last month.  So they're working out the kinks, such as the fact that you currently have to order your food downstairs but your alcohol upstairs.  And the bar only takes cash.  But you can pay debit downstairs, then bring your receipt up to the bar and then bring your beer to your table.  

I will be returning!"}
