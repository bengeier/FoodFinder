{"text":"This place is the best for Breakfast or brunch. The service is excellent, the food is great, and the prices are very reasonable. I come here at least once a month."}
{"text":"The Olive restaurant is located in a strip-mall just a couple of blocks North of the Canadian Tire on Queensway.  The bacon is well cooked, the potatoes are delicious and most importantly, \"over easy\" always comes out perfect.   The coffee is ok, tolerable but nothing spectacular.  The price is fantastic. Breakfast for 2 can be had, with tip, for under $15."}
{"text":"Had a craving for a good breakfast and I must say that I found the right place for it!  I work less than 10 minutes away from this place and myself and the guys have always thought of hitting it one of these days, although mostly for lunch.  Ordered their Breakfast special, 2 eggs, over-medium, home fries, rye bread and coffee.  There's not one bad thing I can say about the place or the food or the service.  Even at 6:45 AM, the place was starting to get busy.  The server was friendly and the coffee refills kept coming.  The breakfast came out in a timely fashion as well.  The eggs were actually over-medium, which was good (usually people screw that up), the home-fries were really good, the coffee was decent.  Was surprised that the coffee was included in the combo.  The place is very good value for money as I came out paying $5.70 tax in + tip.  But I was happy with it.  Will definitely return and also drop by over the lunch hour to see if they can match/ beat the breakfast.  If your'e in the area and are craving breakfast, definitely give them a try."}
{"text":"Dear Cook at The Olive Restaurant,  Putting the burnt side of the toast inside the fried egg sandwich does not hide it at all because you can still taste the burnt flavour all through it in every bite.  Buttering the bread, on the other hand, would've helped a lot as the burnt taste wouldn't have been so unpleasant if the sandwich hadn't been dry as a bone.  Have a great day!  Love,  Me"}
{"text":"Great family run place! It's my go to for breakfast at work. Been coming here for over a year now. Lunch is good but my favourite is the breakfast."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the area heading to Ikea. We decided to drop in for breakfast one Friday,  after reading reviews on yelp about this place. Had a corner table by the window and it was a bit of a tight squeeze. No big deal. Ordered the classic breakfast with 3 eggs over easy, sausages, home fries and rye toast. Ny wife had the same with bacon. Good quality, good price and it was quick with pleasant service. I left feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"The most dreary of diners with a surprisingly tasty breakfast and lunch menu. All standard stuff...but the exterior and interior ambience leave you with some easily beat low expectations. It's open earlier than most places (I think 6 or 7am)."}
{"text":"Hidden gem tucked away in an unsuspecting plaza around The Queensway and East Mall in Etobicoke. No-frills diner style breakfast joint. The traditional breakfast with your choice of sausage, bacon or ham is your best bet. The Olive used to be 4/5 stars in my books. Cheap, fast, hot, great service with frequent coffee refills however, things weren't been up to par during my visit this morning. Huge sign out front saying \"Hiring Full-time/part time cooks\" helps explain this. My eggs Benedict sauce tastes \"off\". Like out of a package. I was too hungover to care at the moment. My friends \"well done\" home fries were just a huge piece of par boiled potato finished on the griddle. Sausages were completely burnt and inedible. Waitress was very nice about sending back food to kitchen. Overall, management needs to hire another waitress or two, and hire better kitchen staff! 3/5."}
{"text":"Great place, Coffee is really good and the food is good too prices are good as coffee included in some meals."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to come for breakfast in Etobicoke! There are so many delicious items on the menu here and the service is always fast and the waitresses are so nice.   They have the best omelettes hands down and the Greek omlette is the best one by far. The eggs are always fluffy and yellow and they are never overdone. The eggs benedicts are all good as well, eggs always cooked perfectly.  Their peameal bacon is the best in the city too- not salty and has tons of flavour.  The lunch menu is very good and they have the best tuna sandwiches EVER!!!! I don't know what is in it but it doesn't taste like anything I have ever eaten before.   All in all the best little breakfast place in the area and good prices. :)"}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much from the outside but it's a great little diner.  Have been getting takeout from them for years.  They have great daily specials which I occasionally order, but my \"go to\" is their toasted western sandwich.  It's a great, inexpensive hot lunch for around $5.  Can't beat it.  Their service has always been friendly, accurate and fast."}
{"text":"The Olive is located about 30 seconds from where I currently work, and recently popped in for a quick lunch on my ever-so-short lunch break.  It's very mom-and-pop-ish. The back wall looks strange, as if they weren't really sure what to put back there, but it's not too distracting. The chairs could have been a little more comfortable, but they're not offensive or anything. They do get some nice lighting coming from outside, so there's that. The pictures on the wall are fun.  The staff (who appear to be family) are all total sweethearts. They advertise a very modestly priced all-day breakfast, but I opted for a standard burger and fries. While I was getting a little concerned on the amount of time it took for my food to come out, it was well worth the wait. The fries were great, and the burger was big and cooked perfectly.  It's not going to rock your face off, but the prices are very low, the staff super friendly, and the food is just fine. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the olive restaurant. It was a Sunday morning and my friend and i were looking for a brunch spot   The pros: Great spacious restaurant with quick service. Prices are affordable. The eggs benny (pemeal benny) was $12, and you get to choose how runny you want the yolk. Mine was cooked well and the pemeal was delicious (crispy)  The cons: Before even being seated, a cup of coffee was poured for each of us. This could be a pro if you were going to order coffee anyways. But it automatically got added to my bill. I can see how this might not sit well with someone who wasn't going to order coffee. The food was cold, especially the home fries which were a bit bland and definitely not crispy. More like baked potato bits."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now for brunch and both times were great.  I had the eggs benedict and my wife had the Greek omelet.  Food came out fast and was very tasty.  The portions are generous for the price too.      Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Good breakfast place. They make their eggs really well. I find the home fries a bit too salty,but that is just me. The ham was good too."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices, good service. It was fairly cold when we came so I had to wear my jacket. Otherwise everything was good. FYI Almost no options for vegans, and hardly a variety for vegetarians."}
{"text":"My regular three-egg traditional breakfast is something I look forward to each weekend.  Great value and phenomenal service!"}
{"text":"Quick and yummy breakfast.   1 cook and 1 waitress so call ahead or just not be in a hurry."}
{"text":"Service was very good. Food options  Are plentiful, the hours are only till 4. Be nice if you could go for dinner..."}
{"text":"Well today was my first visit at the olive ! I have to say the service was great,  the waitress  Was very friendly and fast !  I ordered eggs Benedict florentine which i love however these were not the best in my opinion , The eggs were ok the spinach wasn't cooked  And potatos little burnt but ok  I wish it was good cause I work really close by and would love to have come back as I love all day breakfast ... Maybe try the lunch menu ? It might be better ?"}
{"text":"The place is kind of tucked away on north queen (and a little ghetto tbh) so it really gets overlooked.  But all around the olive is very much above average. Fairly cheap, good quality, quick service and respectable portions.  And a huge plus: it's almost NEVER packed, even on Saturday and Sunday mornings."}
{"text":"We have passed the Olive so many times on our to Crappy Tire etc.. It's in a rather ubiquitous strip mall across from the Mosque. The food is excellent (I have had the breakfast a few times and a liver sandwich at lunch). Value and portion size are both fabulous. Everything is very warm and doesn't taste like it has been under a heat lamp all day. The staff are all friendly and looking to fill up your coffee constantly. The one thing my wife and I really like is the large spaces between the tables, you don't feel like you are kicking anyone and it's possible to have conversations Great place."}
{"text":"Good for all you to leave such positive reviews for this local family owned restaurant because I always drive by it and would have never in a million years thought to stop in.  It's very unassuming as it's located in a small strip plaza just off The East Mall.  It looks like it might be a dive as you drive by but, trust me, it's a hidden gem!  We decided to try it on Saturday for brunch and, let me tell you, we (especially my husband) will definitely be returning.  As soon as we walked in, we got a good vibe as it was very clean and there were quite a few people in there dining.  I ordered one of the specials - two eggs, corn beef hash and homefries (came with rye toast) for $8.95 and my husband ordered the Peameal Benedict for (I think) $11.95.  When it arrived, I couldn't believe how huge the portions were.  Everything was top notch; eggs were cooked to perfection; homefries were perfectly seasoned and crispy and even the toast was good.  I tried my a bite of my husband's Peameal Benedict and the Hollandaise sauce rivaled some of the best I've ever had for that dish.  Only problem was that I ate 2/3 of it at about noon and I was full until 9pm. One thing to note: it's not lacking ambience BUT it's very quiet in there with only one TV playing so, because there was someone at the table behind us, we had to keep our voices/ conversation low.  Bottom line: awesome food, great service and just a good, honest, family run restaurant.  They don't have a website or advertise so please try and a get out and support this local Etobicoke business!"}
{"text":"Seemed like a husband a wife taking care of the place for the day, probably the owners. The woman served us, she was genuinely helpful and nice, nothing forced about it. Typical menu for a breakfast place, no complaints about the meal."}
{"text":"I like to try new places for brunch when I go up to Toronto, so I did a lookup for an inexpensive, high-rated on Yelp place in the area.  Thanks, fellow Yelpers, for giving this good points! The food was plentiful and very well prepared, and although the Hollandaise on my Benedict was a little bland, it was overall excellent, and I'd definitely head back here again. They also gave Lee ham instead of the bacon he ordered, but he'd completely forgotten anyway, and told the apologetic waitress to forget about it. He'd eaten about half of it as it was.  There's a lot of open space in here that they could probably add more seating to, but it could be that they're trying to control how busy it is. By the time we left on Sunday, the place had a line that was starting to go out the door.   With great little places like this, there's no need to head to a chain!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice.  The first time was pretty good.  The food was tasty and the service was ok, not great.  The second time I went was yesterday, and it was also the last.  We were waited on by the same curly haired server who seemed to need a jolt of caffeine, as she could not remember how to do her job effectively.  The time between being seated and getting our meals was approximately 45 minutes....a little absurd for breakfast food, considering they were not any busier than when we went 2 weeks prior.  The waitress never brought the toast for my partner, and the banana pancakes I ordered on my pancake special did not arrive until an hour and 15 minutes into being seated, which was half an our after our meal was brought to the table.  The waitress half heartedly apologized, but you could tell she did not care.  It was not until I got to the register to pay that the young blonde short haired girl gave a heart felt apology.  Sorry The Olive.....inconstancy and lack of service just lost what could have been 2 extremely loyal guests."}
{"text":"Just  keeps getting better. I love to people watch, and the cutest senior couples come in.  Waitresses are super accommodating.  (always check the daily specials blackboard)"}
{"text":"First time I went here I enjoyed it. But I just ordered from skip and received a nearly inedible meal. I asked for medium poached eggs and got them hardboiled. What's even worse is that the egg was completely broken in its container as if the chef tore it apart and was like \"f*** it, just send it like that\" instead of making a new one. Also my steak was supposed to be medium and it was SO beyond well done that it was so chewy. I couldn't even eat half of it. Awful. It's as if they think they can get away with terrible service if it's being delivered."}
{"text":"I came in here on a Saturday afternoon for a late lunch. The place seemed inviting enough. It was clean and kind of homey. There was hardly anyone in there, understandable, given that it was about 2 pm. I was told to sit wherever I wanted to, and I chose to sit by the window. A young couple also sat down behind me. Well! The waitress went straight over to them, asked if they would like anything to start, and completely ignored me. I felt a little hurt, but thought, what the heck, let's not get too sensitive. She did take my order before she took theirs, but that was about it. The young couple was served first, she came by and asked them if everything was okay, I was pretty much ignored. I had to request ketchup, a coffee refill, as well as the bill. Although the waitress was not obnoxious to me or anything, I did feel overlooked and somewhat neglected. The food was decent enough, for a family diner. I ordered a tuna sandwich which was okay, and a generous portion, with so many fries that I simply couldn't finish it. I'm still puzzled as to why the young waitress was favouring the young couple over myself, a single woman of a certain age.  I do hope this young woman - she seemed very young - learns that single women of a certain age, like myself, appreciate good service with good tips!"}
{"text":"An average brunch place. We decided to go here when our first choice (sunny morning) was closed on Boxing Day. The servers are extremely nice and fast. The food was average. I had 2 eggs, hash browns, rye toast and a side of pancakes. The hash browns are made of real potatoes pan fried. Not really very crispy if that's what you like. The pancakes were quite dense not light and fluffy.   Overall it was a good quick no frills breakfast. But nothing really memorable."}
{"text":"Great portions. Waitress was very sweet. Greek omelette had tons of flavor. Pancakes were huge. Definitely a nice low key spot."}
{"text":"A great place for breakfast food. Pancakes were yummy. Side order of fruit had quite a variety. Pleasant staff. Service was quite prompt seeing that every table was full. I would certainly go back again and try their luncheon foods. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food and service from an unsuspecting little dinner in the middle of nowhere.   Came here today with a friend for brunch after reading positive reviews on yelp. The diner itself was dreary and sad looking but it was quite clean and tidy.   I ordered the hungry men and couldn't have been happier. A slab of Peameal bacon, 2 strips of bacon, and 2 sausages, 2 slices of toast,  3 eggs, home fries and 2 slices of French toast for just a little over 10$. Delicious food at an excellent price :)  I'll soon be living relatively close to the olive and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had wanted to try this place for a while.   Sunny morning was closed for renovations... Unfortunately, as it turned out!   I saw a Yelp pic of corned beef hash, and I was looking so forward to trying it... I haven't had it in years, and it's not on many menus.   First cup of coffee wasn't jot enough by far.   Food comes quick.  Waitress was nice.   Corned beef hash was not what I expected.  Corned beef was separate from the eggs and potatoes.   It had no flavor.  Eggs weren't seasoned either.   And prices are no better than other places for eggs Benedict...   Overall, not impressed.  Waiting for Sunny Morning to reopen!"}
{"text":"Ambiance could use some work as it's like a cafeteria, but the food is solid and great value. Exactly what you'd expect, and very flexible with specifying how you like your food prepared. Great service!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast will set you back 10 bucks. Sausage was amazing! Potatoes were slightly undercooked. Scrambled eggs looked like fried liquid egg. The toast was good. The service was excellent."}
