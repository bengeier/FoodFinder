{"text":"My husband and I went there for the first time. We used a Entertainment card for discount.  The food was good. but upon receiving the check there was a service charge of 18 %.  We ask our server he said since we used the discount card. He is require to add 18% tip on the bill and mention that it states it in the Entertainment Book.   Having been a Entertainment member for over 20 years, I had never been charge this in any of the restaurant we visit.  The service we received was not good. He lack  patience in explaining some menu items since it was our first time there.    Just warning people if you decide to use your Entertainment Card.. you will be require to tip the server 18 % no matter how bad the service is."}
{"text":"Was a great place, we ordered or visited 3 times a month. Always quality food, good portions. In Dec 2013 it's under new ownership and it shows. Menu is the same but totally different ingredients for the worse. Basically mall food now. Sad."}
{"text":"delightfully surprised by their pad Thai! full of flavor and tasted authentic. we ordered takeout and the portions were great. can't wait to try their curry next! judging from the reviews we'd be better off getting take out than dining in due to service so we will stick to that!"}
{"text":"Fried ice cream is the best thing in fusion 108! And the food is very nice too! Best place for A good dinner with family!"}
{"text":"This one of the best I found in the area.  Always fresh land hot.  Great coconut soup. Highly recommend it for take out."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Asian food. They have Chinese, Japanese and Thai. If you're looking for above average mall food, this is the place and does the trick for a craving. The menu has a lot of choices and perhaps this is the issue with their food quality. Too many items means not enough time to dedicate to recipes to make them good."}
{"text":"My favorite take away restaurant. Even though i have closer Chinese restaurants near my home I stop by here usually. I like the honey chicken and green curry. The staff is really attentive and take out doesn't take very long."}
{"text":"We dine here often bc the food is great and the prices are low. The service is quick and our food delivered fast and hot.  This isn't at all like the places where it all tastes the same. Be warned, you too will get hooked on this place. Favorites here; the 108 and hibachi shrimp. Only drawback is the weak parking for the shopping center."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in the waitress walked to our table and didn't even greet us. She rushed our order and was extremely put-offish. She took my friend's drink order and then walked away without acknowledging me. She never checked on us and later when we were done, we asked for two boxes which she never brought us. She proceeded to come back after we reminded her and threw the box on the table at me. I asked her if there was a problem and she told me she didn't work for free because we hadn't left her a tip yet and then threw the check presenter on the table. I never leave bad reviews for places, but this was literally the worst service I've ever had and I will not go back to a place that makes assumptions about it's customers as soon as they walk in the door. Do not eat here."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I eat here once a week. The food is fresh and delicious. Lunch is very affordable and there are a lot of choices. The service is fast and efficient. My favorite thing to order is the Thai Ginger Sauce with chicken and brown rice. They accept substitutions (I request broccoli instead of the green pepper) and you get a choice of salad, soup or spring roll. My friend loves their curry dishes."}
{"text":"One of my two favorite Chinese restaurants in the area. Family run, clean, and fast. The food is great, I've never had a bad experience here. Owners are very nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"Good food for great price! Very friendly service. The garlic chicken was good spice flavor but not overpowering and the veggies www fresh! I would come back again"}
{"text":"Very good food and at a reasonable price.    The service is spotty, but I suspect the low volume of traffic is hurting their ability to attract quality staff.  If you give them a shot, you will be surprised.    Great for lunch!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem near my office and I'm glad I found it.  The salt and pepper calamari is fantastic, especially with the chili sauce that they serve it with. The Sesame Chicken was a bit too sweet, but I got a little more of the chili sauce and mixed it right in for a perfect balance."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a Chinese food place that offers other things as well! Their portions are super generous and the veggies are fresh. The spicy chicken and shrimp is a personal fave. The servers are always super nice and take good care of us when our family comes in. I love meeting family here for lunch, with the huge menu there is always something for everyone."}
{"text":"I love fusion 108! I literally eat here a few times a week. Everyone that works there is so nice! Portion size for dinner is always enough for two meals. Pad Thai and Mongolian beef are my faves!"}
{"text":"First time and last time here. Walking into the empty restaurant at 4pm on a Sunday was a warning sign I regretfully  ignored. I ordered Crab Rangoon appetizer and Shrimp Pad Thai  entree. The crab rangoon was runny with large celery pieces inside, which I did not like. When explaining to the waitress I did not want them, she kept asking why (after I already explained) and telling me how much \"everyone else\" likes them.  The Pad Thai was barely ok. I would not recommend this restaurant because of the subpar food. The waitress did take the crab rangoon off the check, I just didn't like her requesting I provide multiple reasons as to why I didn't like them. I was very disappointed because I was hoping the food would be delish since I'm new to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The owner lady is sweet . I come here not only because the food is good and fresh but because I know I will be treated nice. This restaurant also has vegetarian options"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Huntersville. I love going there and hearing the high burning woks do their magic. They don't use MSG, so you don't feel sleepy after eating all the good food. My husband loves the lo mein and fried rice dishes. I usually stick to all the Chinese dishes, the Thai dishes have a more Chinese flair to them, but are still good."}
{"text":"Fresh atmosphere, great service and good food! (not to mention they have THE BEST SWEET TEA IN THE CHARLOTTE AREA!!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh and good, the value is superb and the service, though not flashy, is quick."}
{"text":"Ordered here tonight for the first time ever... My husband called in and picked up our order. He said the staff was very friendly and the restaurant appeared to be clean and he could see in the kitchen. The food was ready when he arrived. My husband had the 108 chicken and liked it, our 3 kids had the sesame chicken and liked it (typical Chinese food), and I had the Singapore noodles with chicken. They. Were. Awesome. I haven't had many curry dishes so the flavor is still fairly new to me. Loved this dish and our oldest son kept trying to eat my food! We also had the crab ragoons, they had more flavor in the filling than at other typical Chinese places. We will absolutely order from here again!"}
{"text":"We regularly pick up dinner from Fusion and occasionally eat in the restaurant. Consistently good, all the time. If you are looking for great food and sensational ambience, this is NOT your place. If you are looking for good food and great prices, Fusion is a solid choice. Large menu, the Thai food has a real kick, and the Chinese food is fresh and flavorful. Really nice 'home base' restaurant when you are hungry for an easy meal."}
{"text":"Three of us had some Chinese and Thai dishes!    Nice looking, comfortable interior with HIGH Booth Backs so you have much privacy to discuss the serious topics!  These Booths make a tiny space like this even more comfortable... NICE touch!  Curry (red) with Tofu (not Paul Koehler, but it could have been and I would not have complained) Thai Basil with Chicken (my order) and 55 got Sesame Chicken!  Staff was very friendly and quickly took away my stir-fried Lemongrass Chicken that I did not order though it looked great and I would have gladly eaten it!"}
{"text":"As a person who considers Thai food a staple, but not quite sold on any one particular spot in this area, I must say that Fusion 108 does a good job at filling somewhat of a Thai void up in the Huntersville area. Although a mix of Thai and Chinese cuisine, and a bit heavier on the Chinese than the Thai, they have a decent selection of curries, Thai soups, Thai fried rices, and several noodle dishes including Pad Thai. I had a curry brown rice that was very flavorful with Thai basil, onions, bean sprouts and a red curry sauce, although I had to spice it up a bit with the chili to suit my spice taste. Portion was huge and could almost be split or have some left over for lunch the next day. With a dinner menu of nothing over $11 including shrimp and squid dishes, and a lunch menu of 20 items not over $7 including rice, choice of soup, spring roll or ginger salad, I must say that the price is right and the food is good."}
{"text":"We just moved to the Huntersville, NC area and have been trying different restaurants.  We were in the mood for thai tonight so through a google search we found Fusion 108.  We ordered two different curry dishes and I am sad to say they weren't very flavorful.  We probably won't go back and will keep searching for a good thai place in the area!"}
{"text":"Thai Ginger was delicious! Healthy, generous portions!! Every time I'm down here I stop by! .. Price is moderately cheap. Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Easily my favorite Chinese food that I've had in the Greater Charlotte area!!! The egg roll perfectly complements their delicious orange chicken. Highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Asian food. Great people and excellent service every time. Try the Salt & Pepper Calamari appetizer. For main entree you can't go wrong with Hibachi Shrimp with vegetables and fried rice. For something SPICY , go with the Thai Lemongrass Chicken with white rice.  Served with a bottle of cold Bud Light."}
{"text":"First time here. Came in on a rainy day. Me and hubby had a taste for Thai. I ordered summer roll, egg roll, red curry and lemongrass chicken. We had jasmine tea. The waitress is also the cashier. She greeted us and told us we could sit anywhere. We were the only customers but a lot of people came in for pick up. The egg roll was a standard Chinese egg roll. The summer roll I was one of the worst. It was basically a bunch a lettuce rolled up with 2 pieces of shrimp. I had to bite it twist before I even tasted the noddles and mint leaf, definitely NOT worth $5. I will never order their summer roll again. The lemongrass was delicious and spicy. The red curry was pretty good but could have been seasoned better. The beef was good. The chicken was that standard slippery Chinese mystery meat. I hate this type of \"chicken\". They got the spicy levels right :) I asked for extra spicy and my nose was running LOL just like I like the heat. Not sure I would drive here again. There are a lot of restaurants in the area so many options."}
{"text":"I wish we would have had nearly half as good of an experience as the other reviewers. The food was not good. My family and I love asian food. When we lived in Charlotte, we loved eating at places like Thai House and etc. I ordered the Hibachi Chicken with Jasmine rice. The chicken was dry and flavorless and the jasmine rice I ordered was what seemed be white instant rice that was over cooked. My daughter who ordered a simple children's portion of chicken fried rice wouldn't eat her food even after allowing her to cover it with the shrimp sauce (she LOVES shrimp sauce) I ate my veggies and left the rice and chicken on my plate. We paid and left. I'm 7 months pregnant and had to find some place else to eat for dinner."}
{"text":"My wife and I Came to eat at 9:30 p.m. And were told we could not sit in the restaurant which is open till 10:00 p.m. because they did not want to serve us. Absolutely terrible service I would not recommend coming here at all. Never in all the cities I have travelled have I been told no while the business clearly states they are open. I will never come back to these people and give them my business, I would suggest you don't either. ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. IF ABLE TO GIVE NEGATIVE STARS I MOST CERTAINLY WOULD GIVE THEM AS MANY AS POSSIBLE"}
{"text":"Exceeded expectations by far!!!  Was skeptical because it advertised $6 dinners but my Thai basil was delicious.  Fresh veggies & chicken in a light sauce.  Hubby had Singapore noodles spiced to his liking & my daughter had lo mein noodles for the first time.  She loved it and is a super picky eater.  Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"We have ordered take out here a couple of times and both times the food was subpar in taste and technique..."}
{"text":"Great experience here. The lettuce were amazing and the egg rolls were great. For dinner we got spicy garlic chicken and shrimp and the green curry. All of it was delicious, even the unsweetened tea!"}
{"text":"I placed a takeout order for lunch. I ordered chicken pad thai (hot), and panang curry with chicken (bc of a yelper mentioning that it was their favorite). I wanted to see if this place has good Thai food, as I had recently moved into the area. Here are my takes on the restaurant:  1) The service was slow, but it was probably because they didn't have enough employees working that morning. The host was friendly.  2) The food was lacking.  -The pad thai was good, but I've had better. The spicy level 'hot' was reasonable. At the moment, my favorite pad thai is at the Thai House in the University Area. --side note: it probably would have tasted a lot better if dining in instead.   -The panang curry was seriously lacking any flavor whatsoever. I was expecting curry to be placed in a soup container, as curries are usually soup-ish, but instead, it was presented like a stir-fry dish. There was too much chicken in comparison to the number of vegetables given--which could be due to an error of choosing the option to add chicken to the panang curry when ordered online.  The website did not state that lunch panang curry came with any meats.  The broccoli was overcooked and the other veggies were very bland.   - The chicken in both of those dishes is marinated with a cornstarch-like marinade. This is what most Chinese restaurants do with their chicken meat, which makes the chicken taste rubbery and fake. Authentic Thai restaurants don't do this. The rubbery chicken throws off the whole Thai food vibe, and made it taste like Chinese food instead.   -The rice that was given with my curry was very little, which can be very frustrating to an Asian person, like myself.  3) The employees seemed to be speaking in Chinese --not trying to be racist-- but it helps me to determine the authenticity of the dishes.   Overall, with my experience today, I would not go back to eat there again."}
{"text":"Of the 100's of asian restaurants i've experienced over the years - including in China - Fusion 108 is one of the best I've ever had. The food is very fresh and the owner is a very sweet woman. Both the Thai and the more traditional Chinese menu are really good. The shrimp are large and the other proteins are fresh. Highly recommended for eating in our carryout."}
{"text":"Fusion 108 is a really solid lunch choice if you're in Huntersville. I was able to walk right in and my order was done in a mere 10 minutes. My sesame chicken was perfectly crunchy just the way I like it and was served with crisp carrots and broccoli -adding a fresh component to an otherwise largely unhealthy meal. Their fried rice was really tasty (not hard or old tasting), though no egg or veggie as is typically found in fried rice. I prefer egg rolls but their spring roll was just fine. At just under $7 it was a good value for the quality. I look forward to sampling their Thai menu next. One last thing to note, this is also a great option for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Stopped in here briefly tapas style to check out something new. From the get go the staff is the pushiest I've ever dealt with. Rude and almost angry even. Somebody please tell me it's just a culture thing or whatever. That aside they are ridiculously fast.  I ordered the shrimp tempura appetizer. It was surprisingly small but did the trick for my appetite tonight. The sauce was good. Tasted like it had a bit of ponzu in it. Never a bad idea.  The mood is chill and relaxing. I like the decor. In some sense it feels like being in a restaurant in China town NY with the neon glows, only a lot cleaner. I'll probably be back to give it another go."}
{"text":"We walked in at 9:15 (they close at 10:00) and were told we couldn't dine in because they closed in 30 minutes. We went to Noodletasia instead and enjoyed a relaxing dinner."}
{"text":"We love this place for a quick dinner, and it is our go-to for Asian take-out. They have dinner specials for around $6 that include a salad. They also have Thai dishes, so a little more variety than the standard places."}
{"text":"Have been here before when there was bad service. This time it was much much better. The servers were very polite and attentive.   Very nice experience and food was very flavorful.  Give this place a try again. They have improved."}
{"text":"If you like overly steamed meat and veggies then look no further, you've found your place. The dish I had didn't contain much in the way of spice or an over abundance of flavor.  However, the lady who waited on me was very nice. Since the prices weren't high, I'd maybe consider going back to try a different dish."}
{"text":"had lunch hear today and ordered soup (hot and sour) and egg drop, both tasted fresh and tasty.  both lunch entrees were fresh and tasty.  will return"}
{"text":"This has become one of my family's go-to restaurants and it is pretty good. I like it because the food isn't too \"heavy\" like some other Chinese food. Today I ordered calamari and wonton soup. The calamari was okay but the portion was small (not sure why I ordered calamari from a Chinese restaurant, so this is my fault) and the wonton soup is pretty standard. However, their other food is good! I've had the chicken and broccoli and it is good!"}
