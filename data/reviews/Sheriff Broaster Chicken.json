{"text":"I believe new management has taken over. Increased prices, decreased quality. Ordered chicken breast burgers served in poor quality buns, old lettuce with a small, thin piece of chicken breast. Spicy burger was a regular burger lathered in hot sauce. I would recommend spending your hard earned money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Surprised they have lasted this long.  Save your money and stay away.  So much variety in Markham"}
{"text":"Got Thursday chicken special. what are they serving? look like crap. 

we are done going here. 

There is still nandos and popeyes"}
{"text":"I used to be a regular customer and have been ordering from this place since the beginning as it newly opened. The quality has become horrible. The food used to be delicious with great quality and quantity, however it's not the same anymore. 

The chicken salad is possibly the worst dish they have as it lacks efficient quality and quantity. The poutine lacks right amount of gravy and cheese. The service is horrible (Women at the counter very rude and unorganized). I have also sensed uncleanness, the health inspection should be done frequently. I know tons of other boaster chicken restaurants which offer a variety, not just fried chicken. 

Did I mention how oily the broasted chicken is? Made me sick. I advise everyone not to eat from here. Terrible experience. The wait is literally over 20 minutes. So disorganized."}
{"text":"Got sick from the raw chicken they served me. 

The service wasn't that great either."}
{"text":"I've been there once. While the cleanliness and decor is above average, the man behind the counter played vulgar Punjabi radio show on loud the whole time we were there. I don't think I will return."}
{"text":"I usually come to Sheriff's for their wings, but I wanted to wait until I tried a few other menu items before I wrote my review. 

This is how it breaks down...
The wings are exactly what you might expect from a good to average broaster place. The outside is crisp with a little extra kick (if you opt for mild). The best deal is 24 whole wings for $25. Apart from the standard sauces (bbq, honey garlic, etc), Sheriff's also has a homemade white garlic sauce. The flavour is robust and pairs well with a bit of siracha (one of my dad's favourite mixes). I will definitely return for more wings. 

If you just came for wings you can stop reading here because this is where I start to rant... While Sheriff's has gotten their wings down to a science, the rest of their food is pretty bad. The shwarmas taste burnt, that is whatever you can taste through their overpowering spicy sauce. Also don't look into your wrap since all else you will find are some wrinkly potato wedges and wilted lettuce. Truly, the taste of sadness....

As for the fries ...they are mushy. The poutine is nothing like a Canadian poutine and to even call this concoction \"poutine\" with it's thin gravy and scant smattering of cheese would be an insult.

My conclusion...good broasted wings, but not much else."}
{"text":"Saturday at 6:30PM, place was dead.

Ordered the mini chicken sandwich ($2.59), got 2 pc chicken combo and an extra buttermilk biscuit. Biscuits are 99 cents.

The bad:
Mini chicken sandwich - such a small lame sandwich. Horrible. Don't get this. Just don't. It was bland.
Buttermilk biscuits - again, horrible. Tasted like it has been stored away for years and has just been microwaved!! It did taste like an OLD WOODEN CABINET. yes i know what that tastes like. Haha.

The good:
Coleslaw - for my fiance , coleslaw was the way he likes it. Sweet and creamy, crunchy.
2 pc chicken - chicken was good. Juicy. Made to order. Was not greasy. Nothing wrong with the chicken.

Service is non-existent.

Tip: Just order the chicken and nothing else.

Won't be coming back.

{"text":"The fried chicken here is pretty decent. The batter they use is different when compared to KFC. I like the flavor and the skin had a nice crispiness to it. Inside the meat was moist and tender. Would I rather have KFC or SBC? I think its a coin flip but since I have had KFC so often then I think I would lean towards SBC if I ever wanted some fried chicken."}
{"text":"Yeah, I cant even properly review this place because we were actually just shunned. My mom and I were at the counter waiting to order, and the man at the counter basically tottered around ignoring us. Then, when a family came in behind us, he proceeded to look right past us and serve them. We looked at each other and confused, watched as he immediately rang throigh and processed their order while continuing to kot acknowledge us standing at th counter. I am blown away and confused. My mom and I were completely ignored and didnt even get the opportunity to try the food. Great customer service...."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is a huuuge fan of fried chicken and the only place that serves \"decent\" tasting chicken is Popeyes..This place is very close to our home and we drive by it everyday so today we decided to give it a try. I went in there with no expectation of whether it'd be good or bad..sat down for no more than 5-7 mins and our special ($3.99 for 2 piece + fries and we added a Pepsi in) was ready. The fries were DELICIOUS - very crispy and fresh.. Each bite was filled with potato flavour (hard to describe).. it wasn't too salty but had just enough taste. The chicken was amazing! Fresh, perfect taste (we ordered spicy but it didn't taste spicy at all..i think it'd be better if it was slightly more spicy). And I couldn't believe how JUICY the chicken was. Seriously - it's 10x better than what you get at popeyes or kfc or any other fried chicken place. Location not the greatest though - for better business I think it's best to have it in a more populated area and also the colour inside (yellow and orange) doesn't give the right feel - way too colourful."}

I won't suggest you to come here for a quick lunch or a in a rush...

Since Sheriff Broaster Chicken are cooked when ordered, the chicken here are fresh and juicy... But the wait time is over 20 minutes! 

The family here though is really nice, but please tell the truth! Asking me can I wait 10 minute for my chicken is just so deceiving.

I though feel a lot better when I stuffing the fresh juicy chicken in my mouth... but since I am running late, I could not really enjoy that!

The website says the chicken is marinated for 12 hours but I just don't take the marination... The chicken under the spicy batter tastes more like poached chicken. Definitely a much healthier version, but may not satisfy one urges for something sinful and greasy.

Daily Specials of $2.99 for 2 piece with fries.. 

P.S. wish my fries are made to order too, they are just a little cold...."}
