{"text":"Great inexpensive Mexican food in the Sun City AZ area.  You have to try the Green Chili Burro Enchilada style."}
{"text":"Have eaten here since I was in high school. I have visited Phoenix with the primary purpose of eating here and I always stop by when I'm in town (which is hard because they are not open on Sunday and close early because they are in Sun City where  a late dinner is 5:30). The locations is not even close (40+ min) to where I usually stay. Worth it.  I love their chips (when warmed) and SALSA. Definitely one my favorite restaurant salsas (and I've tried a ton all over Phoenix, San Diego, and LA trying to find something as good. Very rare). I could drink that stuff.  I usually get the crispy chicken tacos, bean tostada, and bean and cheese burrito. I don't know what they do to their tortillas, but it makes the burrito so good. The crispy tortillas of the tacos and tostada are also excellent. I love the chicken they have in the tacos. Not to greasy or saucy, white meat, very good.   Eat the tacos/tostadas right away! They tend to get soggy if you wait long. If they do, I would request another, because the servers are wonderfully nice and wouldn't want you to have a bad experience anyway. Plus, the tacos are amazing if still crispy."}
{"text":"3 stars = average.  Nino's service was excellent but the food was nothing special.  As others say, order the HOT salsa and mix it with the red salsa and it's delicious.  I ordered a la carte a chile relleno and beef tostada.  Both were good but I prefer the beef tostada from Federico's (Lk Pleasant) where they add sautéed bell peppers and onions.  Husband had a combo platter and said it was ok but the taco was lame with hard taco shells, like from a box. He was disappointed they don't have jalapenos so won't come back!   Even though it's a fast food place, we prefer Federico's soft shell tacos.  Nino's also smothers on the melted cheese if you like that."}
{"text":"Nothing special. The tacos were ok, but the tamale was sub par. The refried beans came out of a can as did the enchilada sauce. Overpriced"}
{"text":"The food and services were great! Ninos has a great staff and a great cook! Yum yum for my tum tum."}
{"text":"Bottom line: Nino's is nothing special.  We have been here twice, trying various dishes and have yet to find anything exciting.  The salsa is served in old fashion carafes, and just doesn't have any kick.  I expect more from a neighborhood taco shop.  Lastly, the service is slow and not nearly friendly enough.  I would go so far as to say that the server was annoyed that they were busy, an odd attitude for a restaurant!"}
{"text":"Store-bought corn chips, weak salsa, soggy beef and bean tostada, a very non-crispy crispy chicken taco, and an okay tasting margarita on the rocks that was 3/4 crushed ice...am I in Arizona?"}
{"text":"Being a valley native I have had my share of Mexican food. Sonoran is my fav and this little place does it up right. Great service and excellent red chili"}
{"text":"As always, I love Nino's.  Last night my friends and I went to celebrate my 24th birthday.  The girls there gave me extra guacamole and a cheese quesadilla just because.  Then brought me a rose and bought a cake for us to share and sang us happy birthday.  I literally couldn't have felt more loved.  They treat us like family every time we are there and their food is beyond amazing.  Thank you and love you guys!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best chimi's in the valley! The beef is always tender and full of flavor. The price is good and the service is great! I will continue to take people there to celebrate their birthdays as well as eat there myself."}
{"text":"Warning - the food and salsa MAY seem bland to you, unless you customize your order.  But if you have a special diet they will take care of you.     And the portions are Huge!  They add very little (if any?) spices / salt but have them handy for you.  Ask for it hot/spicy or ask for hot sauce or HOT salsa if you want to customize. Don't feel guilty about adding salt even to the hot salsa.  Normally salsa at a Mexican restaurant is WAY too salty for me but I add salt here.    Only place i know that doesn't make me feel like a goof for asking for my chicken chimi with no beans.  Yum!"}
{"text":"My uncle used to live near there. I took a friend one night and we both had the green chili burro, enchilada style. I recommend that. It was wonderful. Kind of pricey but good food."}
{"text":"Absolute garbage. Door says they close at 8, but they stop serving at 7:30. Whole restaurant smells of human waste. Before we were rudely told we couldn't eat here, we tried some chips and salsa, no flavor to speak of and the texture of the chips was quite horrrible. At least they support the police force i guess. Didn't even try the food, but every other review on here says it's very bad. I suppose I got lucky!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't know why anyone reviewed this place positively.  Every peice of my lunch, taco, taquito, and tamale, all came out of the freezer section at the grocery store.  The best part of my meal was the water.  A terrible, disgusting meal that is best avoided.  Please do yourself a favor and don't go here.  Find a real taco place and enjoy some authentic food"}
{"text":"Thanks to Michael's review I decided to check this place out. Gotta say that this place is pretty darn good. The salsa is bland as Michael says but adding salt doesn't change the heat. What you want to do is mix it with their hot salsa!  Bingo!  And why would anyone put beans in a chimichanga anyway?  That's not a \"chimichanga\".  So of course bistec sin frejoles. Lol. Also. The best Spanish rice I've had in the Phoenix area so far.  ¡Deliciosa!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place because of the amount of good stars and reviews......BIG MISTAKE! When we arrived, it was 45 min until their closing time. There were only 2 other couples besides us in the place. Like someone else mentioned, the salsa was very bland. When we got our food, we had to constantly blow on it because it was piping HOT! It was almost as if they took the whole plate and put it in the oven to cook. My tongue had a burning sensation for a whole week. I had the chicken tacos and they were ok (nothing to brag about). I also didn't like that you had to use cash instead of paying with any method of payment you wanted. The staff was pretty nice, but I won't ever return to this place."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I have had hands down.... Will make this a regular stop for dinner!!!"}
{"text":"Love Ninos!! We visit family every Thanksgiving and we visit Ninos at least twice while we are here. Probably our favorite Mexican restaurant including the ones at home in CA!!!"}
{"text":"I'll start with the most positive statement I can make: the food was decent. I ordered a chicken chimichanga, chips and salsa and a drink and the total was $15. Price is fair. The food was OK - as I've mentioned in other reviews, I'm from New Mexico, so my standard for Mexican food are high. The chimichanga was alright - the red sauce wasn't hot at all. The salsa was very, very bland. Beans and rice were decent.  Ok, on the customer service. It was initially friendly, when I asked for an itemized receipt, things took a turn for the worse. I am business traveler and my company reimburses me for my expenses while traveling. This place only takes cash or personal check. I paid my tab in cash and ask for a receipt. Angelica hands me a small tear tab from the bottom of the check that lists the total paid (not even the business name was on the tab). I explain that I need an original itemized receipt for my company. She tells me this isn't possible because they have \"to keep the checks in numbered order.\" Umm, OK, I just paid you in cash, now I need an itemized receipt. She tells me, \"Just take a picture of it with your phone.\" I again (for the third time) explain that I need an itemized, original receipt. She then tells me, \"We have a lot of business people eat here and they never need that. There is an app an they just take a picture of it.\" Last I checked, the IRS does not have an app that allows you take pictures of receipts for tax purposes, but whatever. She eventually goes and hand writes a new tickets...she hands it to me and tells me (verbatim): \"In the future, we aren't going to do this for you, so don't ask for it again.\" No lie.   Well Angelica, no worries because there won't be a next time. This was my first and last visit here. Business travelers (and others who may need a receipt for your cash purchase) beware, you won't get an itemized receipt, don't even ask for it!"}
{"text":"My boyfriends family has been coming here for years! They have talked so much about how great the food is and how cool everyone who works there is. I had my first experience and I fell in love! Best place to go for some great authentic Mexican food!   Another great quality is their staff. A group of fun loving, polite, and professional people who look like they love what they do. They are also one big family, which give you that comfort of knowing that they do this together as a family because they love it!   Definitely would say that this is some of the best Mexican food you can get in Arizona!!!"}
{"text":"Love their taco salads. Always fresh and made with their own taco chips. Quality meat & INGREDIENTS. Food is fast & atmosphere is nice. Didn't care for their  TaquillIa drinks tho."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 3 stars for service and staff. Otherwise, the food I had would warrant no stars.   I don't know how this place has the business it does serving that kinda food but, good for you Nino's.   I mean I was there, the place was busy and people seemed to be enjoying themselves.   My food wasn't good at all, barely above edible. The green Chili was probably the best thing I had but some how it seemed to lack flavor.   The Chili Relleno was just a sarcastic amount of cheese & the taco.   Jussss... don't order the taco.     And its notoriously 'Cash Only' pain for millennia babies like me who don't believe in anything but plastic cos then I won't be tempted to donate drug money to the panhandlers that I see on the corners of every freeway in Arizona--seriously, Wtf AZ, clean your shit up before somebody mistakes your homeless population for Portland.   Look, I'm not a bad guy, and I don't wanna give this place a bad review, but would I go here--no.   Did I enjoy myself--yes. But it wasn't because of the food.   See It's been years since I've been back to Ninos. Back when I use to meet my grandmother here before the dementia and police reports. Back when she thought she new what food was and she tried so hard.   So in the spirit of that, I'm going to say thank you Nino's and good luck in the future.  'So long and thanks for all the fish'"}
{"text":"The Salsa Is Great, Ordered a Shredded Beef Chimi With Rice & Beans..... Very Delicious!! The Guacamole Tasted Like My Own Recipe & They Were Generous. And The Staff Was Extemely Friendly & Honest When I Asked About The Menu."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for a long time there food is always good. Everyone treats you like family. Prices are good the only real down falls are the close early and are not open on Sundays. But there nothing wrong with being closed on Sunday also they do NOT take credit or debit cards only cash and checks."}
{"text":"I ate at Ninos for the first time and within two hours I was violently sick. Vomiting for 14 hrs, fever, headache, etc.  Today is the 5th day and heavy diarrhea began at 6am lasting 3 hours.  I've been in bed a week. My husband and I ordered the same dinners (chicken enchilada and beef taco with rice beans, ice tea) except I ordered the hot green salsa.   It doesn't take much in a kitchen to make someone sick with food born illness. I am reporting them to the Health Dept no matter how nice they are or how many great reviews they have accumulated."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Who has a Mexican food restaurant and doesn't serve Carne Asada. They only have ground beef and Chicken!? Plus they do not accept debit cards. Save yourself the time and either walk over to the frozen food section at the Fry's next door and get yourself a frozen Jose Ole Burrito or go over to Taco Bell across the parking lot and save yourself $15. Did I forget to mention that the young girl at the entrance is so rude."}
{"text":"Food was great!  Fun vibe there being family owned and operated.  I had the Chimichanga and my wife had the chili rellenos.  Both were very tasty!  We will be back for our next Mexican food fix."}
{"text":"I'm only giving a star because if I didn't I could not review.  Salsa so bad we told our friends we were meeting to not show up.  If you can't make simple Salsa that isn't made out of a can you should not be serving Mexican food.  I am shocked that so many people were coming in?  But then I realized all old all white and all of them no nothing about Authentic Mexican food.  Worst part they only take cash???????  Great way to avoid paying taxes!  Save time go somewhere else.  Oh best part employees designated at a table were eating and then serving food!!!!  For the love of god this place sucks!!!!!!  I'm over a half of century year old and I know great Mexican food and this is NOT EVEN CLOSE!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and the staff is awesome! Thank you for the excellent rice, beans and tacos. No coca-cola but who cares! Lol"}
{"text":"Been here several times and even got take out once! The service is wonderful!!! Friendly/ humorous staff! And the food, oh my goodness the food is out of this world! Authentic, fresh, delicious food! Even my takeout meal was great! We will keep coming back"}
{"text":"My family has been coming to this place FOREVER. I love it! The food is delicious, the service is efficient, and the prices are right. I will continue to come here, and highly suggest it to anyone. It is however, a hole in the wall... which is usually where you find the best food. I wouldn't suggest you take someone for a first date as the decor is mediocre at best, but if your date is not stuck up, and they like good food, go for it."}
{"text":"This is a great family ran restaurant with excellent food and great people. I love taking my friends family and office there often. It's a great experience every time I go."}
{"text":"Chips were a little oily and stale???, Salsa was great.  Tacos were okay and so was the Taco salad."}
{"text":"Wow, for the price and quality, I am hooked.    In town visiting my mom-in-law and was out running some errands.  So I treated her for lunch.  We both had tostada a la carte.  I had the beef and bean and she had the bean.  It came loaded with lettuce and tomato...  My lunch was really flavorful.  The beef is nicely marinated.  I also had the chicken taco and it was just perfect.  Both were served and it was nice and hot when it came out to us.  I love that!  My pet peeve is hot food coming out warm or room temp!  Thank you Nino's!   Have told my husband, so...we will stop by one more time before heading back to the OC."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food has always been great and so is the service.  The prices are good to.  I miss the owner, he was fantastic, but the great staff helps. My mom loves the soft tacos a lot."}
{"text":"Worst food I have had in area.  Beans were ok, salsa ok, tamale gross, enchilada bland.  Wanted to try this place out for months, very disappointed in all the flavours which were nil to none.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"We wanted to like this place, we really did.  We like to support locally owned businesses.  We picked Nino's over Abuello's for my husbands bday dinner.  It was SO BLAND.  The salsa seemed like just crushed up tomatoes. There is no hot sauce either. Weird. I'm doing keto so I ordered the skirt steak only to be told they are out. (it was  6 pm, Fry's is a couple doors down, btw)  Anyhoo, so I ordered the taco salad with shredded beef. Asked if I could sub the beans and rice in it for a dollop of guac. I was told no, she 's not allowed to substitute anything, she can only (as she's laughing)  \"take things away\".    Husband had a combo platter. He noticed after he ordered a plate that was being served at another table and said \"ugh, store bought taco shells\".  The margs were slushy and tasty.  They STILL DO NOT TAKE CARDS.  We decided pretty quickly we wouldn't be back unfortunately."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill a lot in recent years. More and more often there are issues with orders and service. The hours and days they are open seem to be more sporadic as well. Plus they still don't accept cards... We're almost to 2017... Card readers are cheap. Get one.   On the most recent attempt to eat here we were actually turned away and told we couldn't order. The excuse was that they were running low on food and weren't taking any orders to go. Tons of people order to go here and it seems like incredibly poor planning to run out of the items to make the things they serve, especially on a Saturday night. This is a consistent theme here too. Things frequently aren't available on the menu.   At the moment they've lost our business. We used to order weekly, and routinely. It then turned into monthly or less and now having this issue I believe we're done here for a while. It's sad too because they have pretty good food and a nice atmosphere. But if you can't get the food and the service is so so... Why stay?  Plenty of other places until I decide to try this again in 6 months."}
{"text":"At first I was reluctant because of other reviews.. went in guarded.. chips and GREEN salsa were AMAZING.. now I couldn't wait for my entree, what can I say we have been there 3 times in a week!!!.. I have found a New Mexican food place! Give this small family owned restaurant a try , you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Food was not good. Wife said the chicken tacos tasted horrible. Cheese enchilada tasted like dirt. The bean burrito was ok but I had them add sour cream and guacamole.  The prices were way too high for this low quality of food. I should have known better than to eat here when i saw they don't accept credit cards.  When an owner is too cheap to pay visa/MasterCard 2% of a transaction, you know they are going to be cheap with the food quality too."}
{"text":"This is a terrific family owner & operated restaurant. Their HH margaritas ain't Z Tejas but they hit the spot.  The food is good and service even better. Everyone has a smile & kind word for you.  The menu is your standard Sonoran/AZ fare. Salsa is better than what you get in a lot of higher-end place."}
{"text":"This place is Good Mexican food!  Love the Taco Salad. My husband had the Chili Relleno, Enchilada, rice and beans. It was REALLY good too!!!  Yummy  Yummy Yummy"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. That green chili is the bomb! They serve Pepsi products which of course is best with Mexican food.   I'd do 5 stars if they would step into the year 2016 and accept card payments. I never carry cash, so I always have to stop at Wells Fargo in the parking lot first."}
{"text":"Passing through the area on a road trip and chose this place due to the number of stars on yelp.   I quickly learned this restaurant and area is home to older folks, but the food was overall alright. Only choices of meat was ground beef, shredded beef, or shredded chicken. The chicken burrito enchilada style only had chicken in it. Basically the same thing as the chicken enchilada; the only difference being one used a flour tortilla and the other used corn tortillas.   The service was good, the food was edible, and the environment is very nice and quiet.   4 stars? Maybe for this area, but not compared to all the other restaurants I've been to."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I have ever had. Delicious food, very friendly staff. Amazing all around"}
{"text":"I have heard so much about this place so finally thought I would give it a try.  I ordered a plain and simple taco salad.  The first bite just turned me off.  The lettuce was soggy and mushy and there was some odd spice in the salad that I could not identify. Whatever it was, was not good at all! The waitress gave us about one minute to look at the menu and was there to take the order.  Asked if we could have a few more minutes.  She was back in about a minute again.  We ordered and were checking the place out and in less than five minutes the salad was delivered.  I felt so rushed.  It was obvious that we were not moving to her liking so finished what I wanted of the salad and left.  From the taste of the food and the attitude of the service, I will  not go back."}
{"text":"I have been going to Ninos for about 12yrs off and on. Surprised it took this long to write a review. I've learned when it comes to Mexican food, different things matter more to some people than others. I've seen people judge a restaurant based off their rice and beans (really!?!)  Ninos is a wonderful and small family owned business. They are busy most days and for good reason, the food and service is great. Their family knows mine now and are always so friendly when we come. They will take care of whatever you need,   I have never had anything I didn't love off their menu from simple tacos to chimis. I think their ground beef is exceptionally flavored and tastes great. I love their chips and salsa. The salsa is a puree style, not the chunky like some people prefer. They do make a delicious guacamole too, just straight fresh avocados. That's why it is so good though, not processed or premade stuff.   The building/suite it is in may be a little old as well as much of the clientele, but it is a very comfortable and affordable family meal.   WARNING though, last I paid attention they only accepted cash or checks."}
{"text":"The service was pretty good the surroundings are nice, however the food is bland and it's for elderly people I'm in my moms account I'm a 11 Years old.  Update: I took my daughter to this restaurant. A lot of people where there and every table was full. Although there was no wait for us, she's right. The food wasn't all that flavorful. However, our waitress was very sweet and most of the customers were old people, I was a bit disturbed they don't take credit card. Luckily I had enough cash to pay our meal. Cute decor though."}
{"text":"Good neighborhood spot.  Service is fast and friendly.  They serve a mild and a not-so-mild salsa which is tasty.  I ordered a soft shell chickent taco which was more of an enchilada but pretty tasty.  Also enjoyed a glass of chardonnay which was very reasonably priced.  The decor is bright and cheerful.  Good place to stop in for a quick lunch or dinner.  It is tiny and it does fill up."}
{"text":"Great green chilli burro enchilada style...like traditional Mexican food here 50 years ago--and you can get it in a mini version, which is a normal portion. Very disappointed in the ground beef taco--meat blah, and a preformed taco shell that tasted like the boxed ones from the grocery store. A plus is a cold glass that was served alongside the cold bottle of beer. Mini cheese crisp was great ans shareable for 2."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been going here for over 7 years every Friday night. Best food and great service. Fifi is the best and runs this restaurant like the pro she is. Always sweet and fun! I recommend this restaurant to everyone! Nancy and Gil love  Nino's!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Waitress excellent. Extra hot salsa was delicious. We ate several bowls. Taco was terrible. taco Bell style preformed shell. Tostada that way too. C'mon isn't there a Mexican restaurant (since La Perla closed down) that has both great food and great salsa? This place is not that."}
{"text":"This place is great! From the food to the people your not gonna find better. My family has come here for years and years. I drive 30 minutes to eat here, and it's worth it every time. The hot sauce is the best I've had in Phoenix. It really feels like your family here, everyone is always pleasant and the service is awesome. It can get busy but that's a good sign, right? It's in Sun City, but you've got to try it. I've read the complaints on here and I'm baffled. I eat here A LOT and never have heard a complaint or seen the sour puss face. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Great family owned business.  I love coming here.  It's been a while since my last visit but they always remember me and my family.  The chimichangas smothered are the best."}
{"text":"Good for Sun City Mexican food. The salsa is OK buy has no heat to it. The meals are good but a little on the bland side. The real plus is the pricing.  Its pretty cheap but they only take cash which can be a hassle for those of us that only carry cards. My grandmother's favorite Mexican food but not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Just say no.  For a family place, they have no heart or passion and it shows.  Bland and prepared food.  Salsa was not worth eating.  Asked for more spicy and was told people enjoy the salsa...what does that have to do with my request?  Blank look and no response to request.  Plate of food was not appetizing. Sad really."}
{"text":"I love Ninos......I feel it's authentic Mexican and I am hooked on their Chili Relanos.  I stop for lunch every chance I get."}
{"text":"Always crowded and always great food! This place is a place I have frequented since I was a little boy. I love their chili relleno and tacos! Highly highly recommended!! Get there early!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was a young child(20+ years) Great hole in the wall, cozy place to eat. Run by a good family making home style Mexican food. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Get's better all the time.  We love Nino's and we love the new menu.  Fifi and all the girls are great!!  We get the  #1 Taco, Enchilada, rice and beans....Yummm.  Great prices too."}
{"text":"A cozy little family owned business I'm guessing.  We decided to try it out for dinner and don't know why we haven't been here before.  I had the steak picado and she had the chicken picado.  Both were very good! Every bit as good as the Mexican chain food restaurants. We will definitely be back to try some of the other offerings. Our waitress was very helpful to assist us with our choices and it was very much appreciated!"}
