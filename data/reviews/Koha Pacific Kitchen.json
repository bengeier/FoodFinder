{"text":"I tried the Korean Chicken Bao today ($5) - I was initially confused if the meat was Chicken or Pork due to its 'boiled' appearance -  Overall, the Bao was satisfying - The pickled carrots and cucumber added a nice crunch and the spicy mayo dressing was delicious. I just wish the chicken had a better texture to it."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for lunch yesterday and it was awesome!!  I had their spicy pork bowl which had tons of flavour and a kick ass sauce.  It wasnt actually very spicy though so next time ill add some extra hot sauce on the end.  The ingredients seemed fresh and I liked that I could also swap out some of the items for ones I wanted.  It also seemed like better quality than most other food court places and at $11 it was pretty reasonable.  They have a really interesting menu with other korean bowls, bao buns and poke bowls so I will definitely go back to try out some of their other items.  Great first impression!!"}
{"text":"Would NEVER go here again. Got so terribly sick after having the chicken. Stayed home for a few days.   Spoke to my coworker and he got sick at the same place and stayed home for 3 days. I would recommend to go somewhere else for Korean food."}
{"text":"Decided to check out the Korean/Hawaiian restaurant at the food court and was not disappointed in the slightest!  Very fresh ingredients in their tasty Poke bowls and baos!! Was incredibly satisfied with the food and the staff members were helpful and kind.  Would recommend for anyone looking to grab a small snack or a filling meal."}
{"text":"3.5 for me. I tried the ahi tuna bowl and was impressed that they had zucchini noodles as a base, it was good and interesting! They were also very generous with toppings unlike some other places. However, the tuna was not very good quality and cut very poorly (as if with a dull knife). For $15 I would expect decent quality fish being used. I still enjoyed my meal though and would come back to try their other items."}
{"text":"Koha has a new location in the food court at 200 Wellington St. West (in the former Japanese Teriyaki space).  I had the Bao Bun with beef today and the Korean BBQ chicken with rice - both were tasty and well priced.  Koha is a very good addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Delicious, healthy & fresh KOrean-HAwaiian options at the Commerce Court! This place is super refreshing in the midst of the other heavy food options at the food court. Definitely the BEST option for lunch in the middle of a work day - for meat eaters and vegetarians/vegans! So everyone. Today, we tried the Classic Salmon Bowl on purple rice and 2 bao's (spicy pork & panko tofu), and they did not disappoint at all - explosion of flavors actually! :) I usually don't like the ginger that comes with sushi, but even their ginger is delicious. There are different options for poke/korean bowls, and you can also build personalized bowls for basically the same price! Ingredients were FRESH, the sauces were YUMMY, and service was GREAT!! Definitely going back as often as I can!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and built my own salmon bowl. The toppings and sauces are Korean inspired, hence it's a bit different than the other poke bowl places downtown. For example you can get gochujang (Korean red pepper paste) as one of the sauce options, or kimchi, seaweed, edamame for toppings. The flavour was OK but the downside is it's a bit pricey. I had to pay $1.5 extra for avocados in my bowl. I also didn't find too many toppings that appealed to me. I ordered the salmon bowl with kale, edamame, seaweed salad, crunchy onion, avocado and spicy mayo sauce."}
{"text":"I tried Koha for the first time this past week. I made a custom poke tuna bowl ($13.50). I had it on zucchini noodles which I really liked. The options of toppings and garnishes were really great too. Everything tasted fresh and portion size was very filling. Also, to note the line up seemed pretty long when I arrived, but the staff there moved it along super quick. Will be back for sure!"}
