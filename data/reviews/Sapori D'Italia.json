{"text":"No better place to dine. Owners are fantastic.  Food is top notch deserts are out of this world. Pork shanks tenderloin all very good."}
{"text":"I've been on a quest to find real pizza in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area after relocating from Chicago where there are real Italians making real pizza (mostly Naples-style - Nella, Eataly, Spaca Napoli). After visiting 10-15 pizzerie in Arizona, purporting to make Italian-style pizza, I began to think that nobody understands that more ingredients does not mean a better pizza. Finally, I stumble upon Sapori D'Italia.  I ordered the margherita (the standard by which I rate all pizza), and it was made correctly (not slices of tomato or multiple cheeses).  Everything is made fresh in house. The tomato sauce was simple, not sugary.  The dough was simple and fresh. Likewise, the mozzarella was fresh (I was told it's made in house). I can't count the number of places I've gone that insist they use fresh mozzarella, only to see shredded goo appear on my pizza.  Sapori d'Italia makes a solid pizza.

The wine list is simple, but will do the job.  Service is great - everyone was very kind and appropriately attentive.  If you sit outside, there's a gorgeous view.  The location is not convenient unless you live in Fountain Hills, but if you care about pizza and quality ingredients, this is well worth the trek. To top it off, the prices are very reasonable.  I'm really happy to have found Sapori d'Italia.  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We recently moved to Fountain Hills and have been here four or five times.  Here are our favorites.  The flatbread/pizzas.  They are exceptional; thin crispy crust and always with fresh stuff on top.  If they have a special pizza, I would order it.  The Gattopardo with arugula/prosciutto was the closest thing to the pizza we loved in Italy.  My mouth is still watering over the Chicken Piccata.  My husband had the marsala and that was great too.  The calamari is fun if you have a group.  

We like to go and have a glass of wine, salads and share a flatbread.  That is plenty for us.  Other people reviewed that the portions were small, I would say the portions are \"normal\" and for the price, I think fine.   It is nicely family run, with good service but not smothering. Maria works the front of the house.  Her husband works the wood fired pizza oven.  By the third time we were there, they welcomed us like we were family."}
{"text":"My husband and I, are from NJ.  He makes a fabulous gravy so we rarely go out for italian food.  On the rare occasion that we do dine out for italian food, we have excellent italian restuarants in our area and some are very hard to match. So hence the reason for being sceptical.  And just because a few reviewers wrote a glowing review, we took it with a grain of salt. The waitress suggested a combination appetizer, which we ordered. Yum - perfect calamari and gravy.  We shared the pasta bolognase plate for dinner.   We were more than happy with our choices.  I was just starting to think about dessert when the waitress brought us a big piece of cheesecake & another glass of wine! I TELL YOU WE WERE FLOORED!  If I am ever back in that area, I will go back.
I am home 2 days now and I'm still thinking about that dining experience."}
{"text":"Our first dinner in Fountain Hills.  We were introduced to Maria and Gasper, and you'd think we lived here our whole lives.  Atmosphere is wonderful, Pizza and Salad was our choice... ALL WONDERFUL!  This is also the first Canole I ever really liked, and I liked it A LOT!!!  We will become regulars!"}
{"text":"My husband and I always look forward to having dinner here. We had some friends from out of town join us for dinner and they said they want to come back. They really enjoyed their meals. Must make reservations. The waitress was just so so, a little slow but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Really, really good!  House made meatballs are excellent.  There is even a home made spaghetti.  Pizza is really good,  but the mussels with marinara is what I crave when I go here.  This is the best restaurant in Fountain Hills by far."}
{"text":"It was our first visit to this wonderful Italian restaurant.  The food was delicious, well prepared, good portions, and appropriately priced.  Tiffany,, our service professional was absolutely fabulous!!"}
{"text":"Despite having run out of mint (for a mojito), linguine, knots ( I embarrassed myself and the very adorable Nikita by calling them \"balls\" when I asked for seconds), a particular white wine, and beef (a weekend-festival slammed them early and we had a late reservation), we raved about  what we did end up ordering.  The mussels with capellini in white wine sauce is a new standard to rate all others by.  The caesar salad was tossed and coated perfectly with dressing that nailed the subtle bite.  If you like caesar salads, you know what I'm referring to.

As a group of five women celebrating 30 years of friendship, the stars couldn't have lined up more perfectly for us when we chose this place.  Nikita charmed us with his bashful smile, Maria with her gorgeous vitality and side-splitting Dorito story, chef Gaspar personally chatting with us and other diners as the last of the evening's orders came out of the kitchen, and the overall rustic warmth of this family restaurant kept us in our seats until we realized we were the last of two groups.  If you are offered cookies that are not on the menu, jackpot!  You only get one, so enjoy each bite s l o w l y.

Delicious food and great people make for a 5 star experience."}
{"text":"We went for dinner and where so happy they had an outside patio, which is where we ate. We ordered clams w/linginie and my husband had chicken marsala. They were both fantastic. The pasta is homemade and wonderful. I got a side of vodka marinara sauce, which I could drink right from the bowl it was so great! We got pizza crust to eat before and during the meal. The crust is awesome and you get that great wood burning pizza crunch and flavor. 
We are so happy we found this place. We will be back for many years to come!"}
{"text":"We went to Sapori Friday night and it was a delightful experience. They have a beautiful outside patio and a more than decent wine list. Also love that they have Peroni on tap :-) I got the Siculi pizza which was delicious and the lobster ravioli also got rave reviews from the group I was with.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good service, good food.  We sat outside on a pleasant spring night.  I had the egg plant Parmesan and a nice glass of wine.  My wife had spaghetti and both of us were happy with our meals.  Fountain Hills has a few good places to eat and this is one of them."}
{"text":"I this is one of my favorite places in Fountain Hills! I like to go to locally owned business whenever I can and this one is owned by the sweetest family! I look forward to getting my hug from Marie every time I go. 

Now about the food, the reason we use yelp to begin with:) 
I've liked everything I've ever had there but my favorite things are the Eggplant Parm perfectly cooked, the eggplant is tender and full of yummy flavor, or any of the pizza's, you can beat wood oven pizza's in my opinion! Everything seems to be made with fresh and high quality ingredients."}
{"text":"The food is top notch.  Nicole was our server last night and was fantastic, she was knowledgeable, friendly, and had great energy.  We tried the sampler appetizer, home made mozzarella, amazing raviolis, bruchetta and calamari.  I'd give this 6 stars if I could.  Pasta was something I'd get back on the east coast.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"The service is generally good, can be a bit slow at times, but the food more than makes up for it.  Everything we've had there has always been excellent.  I'm particularly fond of the pizzas and calzones.  The breads served as appetizers are always fresh and flavorful with excellent texture.  We didn't visit before the Restaurant Impossible show, and probably wouldn't have, because Italian restaurants outside of New York City generally aren't my thing, but a friend saw the episode and told us we should try it.  We are glad we did and have been back a number of times over the last year.  The atmosphere is very comfortable and casual.  But... the cheesecake.  OMG Maria's cheesecake.  Words cannot do it justice.  The cheesecake is fantastic.  The lemon being my favorite."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this restaurant. We arrived on a Friday evening around 5:30 and were greeted warmly by several employees. The place has a very friendly, comfortable feel to it, very different than the big chain restaurants. Our waiter was helpful, patient and attentive. The bread came out first. It was great! It's actually the thin crust they use to make their pizza. It was a tasty change from the usual bread. We shared the chicken parmesan and fettuccine alfredo. The chicken was large enough to share. They had also brought us a bowl full of fresh grated homemade mozzarella. We put some on everything, even the bread. We loved everything about our experience and will be back for more."}
{"text":"REAL Italian! Absolutely LOVE this restaurant.  It's home made, Mamas kitchen style Italian, the real deal.  I frequent Sapori  and they thrive in consistently. Maria is the best, visits the tables, sits down with her customers and treats them like family visiting the kitchen in her own home.  
The food has east coast flavor, home made pasta and great portions.  They have a great brick fire over for the fresh pizza and amazing specials and Gluten Free options. $20 for a pizza of your choice and a bottle of wine?! what else do you need?
The atmosphere is great, nice seating inside with standard tables, bar seating and high top.  The outdoor patio is huge, perfect for large parties, its covered with heaters (for the winter) and a hand painted mural by Gasper.  
I driver up from Gilbert to get my fix.
I have been in a rush and got lasagna to go, always quick and easy. 
HIGHLY recommended from and East Coast Italian that is very picky. If you want AUTHENTIC, this is your place."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed a superb dining experience at this authentic Italian restaurant.  We have recently visited Sicily and the food was just as delicious here.  The service was excellent and the owner's took interest in our food and service.  This is a gem!  My husband is 100 percent Sicilian and very picky about his cuisine and he gave this restaurant 5+ stars!"}
{"text":"What a charming place with great food and personable staff!! I ordered the chicken piccata, and it did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"This is one of the better restaurants  for Italian  food. Service is great. I would recommend eating here anytime you want to have Italian  food"}
{"text":"We love Sapori!!! My parents live in Fountain Hills so everytime we visit this is our #1 go to.  Everything is homemade from the bread to the cannoli.  Our fav is the the Za, it is fantabulious... hand made by Gaspir, it's just like being back in Italy. Staff is great, Maria and Gaspor (owners)are super friendly and fun, everyone is family here. Here visiting we will be here 3x in 10 days!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable. The food and service were excellent. The daily specials are fantastic. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"excellent italian food from sicili. owners are from pallermo.
great pizza and clams with linguini.great atmosphere too"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner in the beautiful Fountain Hills area. The atmosphere is warm and friendly . However, me and my 30 something year old friends were easily the youngest people there. :-)
The wine list is good and the waitress very helpful in making the choice. 
For appetisers we had the eggplant olive dip and bread and it was very tasty. 
Whenever, I try out any italian restaurant, I have to try the tiramisu and the chicken marsala to add  to my search for the best. While the tiramisu was good, the chicken marsala was disappointing as the sauce was very thin and lacked in flavor.The chicken also seemed bland. (The marsala is the only reason I give the restaurant a 3 instead of a 4). 
We had a good time and would recommend the place if in Fountain Hills. Given I live in scottsdale, I may however not repeat the drive to visit again.
However, it looked like a favourite with the residents and was pretty crowded at dinner service. 
 
ps: The restaurant has a good view of the fountains , so I'm a little surprised why their seating arrangement isint such that diners can see the fountain while eating."}
{"text":"We have recently been frequenting this excellent restaurant. The menu for happy hour is excellent and so reasonable and it lasts till 9pm.  Drinks are very inexpensive also.  Pizza is superb and appetizers border on gourmet.  Cheesecake is homemade and delicious."}
{"text":"From Chicago.  In Phoenix for golf with buddies.  3rd year in a row coming to this restaurant and it is a highlight of out trip.  Garlic butter rolls to die for. Appetizers are terrific.  Try the Italian meats or calamari. 

Dinners are exceptional.  Veal parm is awesome.  The lasagna made from scratch daily.  Desserts are heavenly. 

Best part is the owner who frequents the table to ensure everything is to perfection....and it is.  

Don't miss.  In fountain hills and worth the drive. 

Henry D"}
{"text":"We have enjoyed our dining experiences here many times and have always felt so pleased with the service provided and quality of food. Everything here is homemade and made with love and it shows from the wood fired pizzas which are the best I have ever had to the homemade pasta, cheeses and desserts. The Tiramisu is wonderful. They really know how to take care of their guests and I look forward to our future visits!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this restaurant for the first time last night. We just saw it on Restaurant Impossible a few nights ago and needed a place to eat before hitting the theater. As soon as we got out of the truck I was scared. It smelled SO bad, like a sewer smell. 

Once inside the noise was almost unbearable. Maria came over and said she would clean a table for us. The place is very small inside. She grabbed a rag and wiped the table. When we got to the table my chair had food all over it, and it looked like the floor had not been cleaned as there was food all over. Nowhere to put my purse except on the floor...yes, on the food!

The waitress came over and told us they were out of the specials so she wouldn't waste our time telling us what they were. It was a Friday night at 6:45 pm and they're already out of the specials??

I ordered a lemonade. It smelled funky and when I tried it, it tasted like dirty water. Had my husband taste it just to be sure. Traded that for a soft drink. 

I ordered the chicken parm. Not too bad. Veggies smelled and tasted horrible!!  Like burned plastic. Had hubby try too and yep, they were gross. He ordered veal parm. It was rubbery and over cooked. He thinks they used lemon juice on it which gave it a bitter taste. 

Even when the restaurant emptied a bit, we were yelling at each other to be heard. Way too loud!!

All in all it was a huge disappointment. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Nice owners. Very nice and cozy space. It is fit for groups, .specials ocasions and every day dining. I wish it was not so far from where I live."}
{"text":"This  place is Fantastic! We Had to eat here 2 nights in a row, the food was so amazing!!! Everything was fresh and handmade from the breads to the fresh mozzarella, meatballs, and pasta. You can  tell that there is alot of love put into this italian cooking! You must also save room for desert..the cheese cakes are to die for, vanilla cream puff  was amazing and  the almond cookies were from heaven. Thank  you so much Maria and  Gaspar,  we will be back asap."}
{"text":"Amazing food and family friendly service. The homemade brick oven bread, pappardelle pasta and homemade cheesecakes are all amazing. This is our favorite restaurant in Fountain Hills!"}
{"text":"Biting into DEAR PIZZA IS SHEAR HEAVEN....I WAS JONESING 4 one of Gasper Pies..That first bite ....2 the moon & back ....xxoooo love them xxxoooo Best Italian Restaurant in FH..!"}
{"text":"Visiting in the area and we dined 3 out of the 4 nights we were here and would have all 4 nights if we could have. Pizza's are some of the best I have had in NYC, Chicago, San Francisco. Gaspar prepares fresh dough, marinara sauce and mozzarella each day. Made from scratch Lasagne, Pasta Bolognese and Veal Parmesan are off the charts. We have anointed Maria as the desert queen... From scratch NY cheesecake offered in a variety of flavors, plain, lemon, pumpkin, chocolate ganache along with cannoli's and tiramisu.  It is not often you dine at a restaurant and literally can't decide which of the many awesome menu items to order. Instead, we elected to take a tour of Sicily ordering several apps, entrees, pizza's, deserts and table side shared over a couple of bottles of wines. We all left with smiles on our faces. Spectacular food in a great setting with wonderful people like Gaspar, Maria and staff makes for truly memorable evenings. If you have a chance, sit bar side overlooking the imported wood fired brick pizza oven watching Gaspar prepare his masterpieces. Treat yourself.... it's worth the travels from any distance."}
{"text":"Food is excellent!  Their salads have decreased in size, but not price.  The service needs drastic improvement!"}
{"text":"Food and staff were average. We got our app order in, but our waiter took forever to return for our entree order. The antipasti was good;  the bolognese needed more tomato tangy-ness. The vodka sauce was nice but left you wanting something more to fill it in. The seafood pasta was ok, the seafood tasted somewhat dry."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place, but I just can't. My friends and I have given them two chances and both times we left feeling underwhelmed.

Both experiences were after our wine making and bottling experience at Casavino Winery down the street.  The first time, we knew nothing about the restaurant except that it looked warm and inviting from the outside. The ambience is lovely; it feels cozy and intimate. When you get that vibe from a restaurant, you just know you're in for a treat, right? I wish.

We had a ditzy waitress who clearly knew nothing about the menu. I asked her what the lobster ravioli was like, and she responded with \"I don't think there's actually any lobster in it.\" Really? No lobster in lobster ravioli? Choosing to play it safe, I opted for the cheese ravioli (which was quite tasty). I also thoroughly enjoyed the pizza crust bread they brought to whet our appetites. However, the service for the remainder of the evening was consistently mediocre.

We decided to give them another chance tonight since the food was decent the first time. This time, our waitress was friendly and kept a good eye on our table. I once again inquired about the lobster ravioli and she confirmed that yes, it contained lobster. I ordered it with the vodka sauce, while my boyfriend selected it with the lemon garlic butter sauce that she highly recommended. Our friends both ordered ravioli as well, albeit not lobster.

ONE HOUR LATER our food arrives.  Our waitress was very apologetic about the wait and ensured our bread bowl was continually replenished, but we were quite anxious for our entrees....which showed up COLD.  At least, the two lobster dishes did. Mine tasted fine when it was finally heated up, but my boyfriend and I definitely didn't care for the lemon butter garlic sauce. Once again, our waitress was very apologetic and assured us that she served us as soon as the chefs were done, but at this point, considering we're rarely in the area, we're done giving Sapori D'Italia chances.

It's a shame - there are so many rave reviews, and the little family run business has a lot of potential....but they have some kinks to iron out."}
{"text":"The service was extremely slow.  There were 5 of us eating and 2 had cold and not enjoyable meals at all 2 had good food and the other person got the wrong meal to start with.  I had even pointed at what I wanted because of not sure how to say what it is called.  After getting the waitress back to the table to get the right order she came back and said it would be rushed to get it quicker, when it finally did come everyone else was finished eating and it was cool.  They took it back to put the steak on the grill again.  They offered a dessert but not interested as everyone else wanted to go home.  When it came again still only lukewarm.  When I paid the bill it came back without my credit card.  The waitress insisted that it had been in the holder.  After much looking it was found on the floor behind the hostess stand.  While they did comp the one meal, they gave us 3 slices of cheese cake for our trouble.  Will not be going back anytime soon or recommending it to anyone."}
{"text":"Great food as always...waitress a little abrupt. Pizza is amazing! Definitely worth a return trip."}
{"text":"Just flew into town looked up restaurants for dinner and found this wonderful place.  The atmosphere, food and hospitality was fantastic.  A family run, old school restaurant done the right way.  Can't say enough about this place!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous experience on jan 4 for my b day. Food amazing plus the homemade cheesecake and Italian cookies were outstanding. Thank you Maria and Casper for making my b day very special."}
{"text":"Hubby and I recently moved to Fountain Hills and were in search of a close-by GOOD Italian restaurant (no Olive Garden-type stuff for us!) so we stopped into Sapori D'Italia, and were so glad we did!  The atmosphere was nice and cozy, size-wise.  The main dish was EXCELLENT.  I am picky about my alfredo sauce, and they nailed it!  The homemade cheesecake was the second best I've ever had (hubby's is the first ;-)) and I am dying to try the tiramisu.  The owners are very very nice.  We were impressed by how they each came and sat with us and talked for a long while.  That proves that they really care about their customers.  The service was also great, and I regret that I forgot the server's name, but I was told she'd been there for a long time.

I would have given 5 stars but the interior noise was almost unbearable (bad acoustics?).  At the end of our visit the restaurant pretty much cleared out and even with minimal people there, hubby and I still had to yell-talk to each other.  Also, I would much rather be served warm Italian bread before my meal rather than the bread that was served (like a pita/wafer type bread).  Other than that, everything was sooooooo great, we will definitely be back and recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"So third year in a row in town with the golfing buddies and each year we are certain to eat here at least once.   The food and service are terrific and the pricing is very reasonable as well.   Maria makes the desserts and runs the restaurant.   She also takes the time to stroll the tables and meet and greet the patrons.   She even toasted our group with some Lemoncello after our meal.  A very nice touch I must say!

We had the chicken Marsala which was very tasty and the meat tender.  The pizzas are terrific and made in a wood fired oven.  The best!   Be sure not to overlook this restaurant when in town!"}
{"text":"We were golfing in the area and were looking for a good wood fire pizza restaurant as we had worked up an appetite.   So glad we found this place and it's all about timing.   Restaurant had just opened and the pizza oven was ready to go.  Pizza was amazing,  cooked to perfection.  Also had the meatballs and fried ravioli's which were also great, but the best part of it all was the home made Chocolate ganache cheesecake.   WOW!!!!  We'll definitely be back...."}
{"text":"Superb! All fresh and made in-house. My lasagna was as good as it gets anywhere anytime! The pizza was perfect. Other pasta dishes excellent. Fresh lettuce and ingredients in the salads. The cheesecake was fantastic. Great service... Very accommodating to special requests too. A gem of a small restaurant to support locally! We'll be back."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, then it's time to leave. Absolutely clueless for even basic southern italian dishes. Eggplant under cooked, slced too thick, skin left on. Tasteless sauce.
Pasta dishes were poorly prepared."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to eat and enjoy the family atmosphere!! Maria is a great host and owner. You know you are in loving arms when you come to eat here. The food is the best you can get outside of Italy. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Italian pizza.  After living in Italy for a while, this is one of the closest pizzas to what I ate there - great crust and toppings without too much gooey cheese.  Had one with proscuitto, arugula and fresh mozzarella - wonderful! The foccacia bread was also awesome.  The pasta bolognese was good, but more typical tomatoey that what I found in Italy.  The homemade sausages were great. Meatballs okay.   Wish they made their own pasta.  Server was very friendly and helpful, but they seemed understaffed as she had to keep running.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour, friendly staff, and a comfortable bar that overlooks part of the kitchen (large stone pizza oven).  We come here regularly and always want to return soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent.  We ate at Sapori D'Italia (a taste of Italy) three nights in a row on our annual visit to Barrett Jackson (Gasper's Wood Fired Pizza, Chicken Piccata, Ribeye Steak) all excellent with all ingredients made from scratch with home made recipes from Italy.  Maria's cheesecake is also home made and we regularly take one back to Milwaukee with us!"}
{"text":"I agree with Joanne H. It's no wonder every poor review has something extremely negative to say about Maria. This place left such a bad impression that I felt compelled to share my experience. My partner and I walked in today and the hostess and servers all greeted us warmly, all except Maria who was also standing there. The hostess asked us, where we would like to sit? She gave us several options to which I replied, \"the dining area\". The hostess proceeds to look at the seating chart along with Maria who responds, \"seat them at table 10 for now.\" Still not acknowledging us. I'm not sure what \"for now\" meant. Ponder that one. We sit and our server named Paleesa (I'm sorry for butchering your name dear) really politely served our table and was honestly the only positive experience we had in that entire restaurant. I ordered the Parpadelle Bolognese and my partner the Chicken Parmesan which were both good not great. The white and red sangrias were lovely. I'm from NYC where we know our Italian food, this was ok. But the food was honestly not the worst experience. It wasn't busy, there were four tables to be exact. Maria seemed very approachable and friendly to every other table as she walked to and fro greeting and having conversations with all the guests, some which she was obviously familiar with. All the while just passing by our table as if we weren't even there. Even making a point to say hello and introduce herself to the lady sitting at a table about four feet away from us. Although I prefer to not be bothered and enjoy the ambiance and evening with my partner, Maria was obviously going out of her way to ignore us, something which was evident from the moment we walked through the door. Could it be that we were 30 somethings, outsiders, I, a Latin American and my partner an Indian American? I don't know, I personally don't care. I too am a shop owner and every single customer is made to feel equal. I would be humbled and grateful that out of so many establishments you would choose to spend your hard earned money in my business. This here is not the case. It's so easy to be pleasant and friendly to those you already know but the true test of character and heart is showing that same courtesy to the \"strangers\" who are also guests of your establishment. I think that's how you keep them coming back, am I right? Or maybe she's just interested in her \"regulars\". However, she didn't seem interested in our business. I'm a New Yorker and I overheard her mention she lived in NYC. Well we New Yorkers are very tolerant, open minded, we love diversity and great food. And great food has a way of bringing people together. Both which is failing in this restaurant. Great food and bringing people together. So we pay our tab and start walking out of the door, Maria starts to also walk out of the door and sees me leaving as well and instead of holding the door for me she lets it close behind her. This woman is rude. Talk about going out of her way. As she sees us leave she still doesn't even say a word to us. She proceeds to use her phone and walk back into the restaurant. My hats off to our server and the rest of the staff. I hope the owners know how lucky they are to have you. They were indeed a good example of how to treat a customer, something Maria should try to model herself after. It's good to be kind, It doesn't cost anything. Never coming back here again, good riddance."}
{"text":"After having an outstanding meal, a family member had a medical issue. The owners and staff were incredibly kind and considerate. We highly recommend the food, wine and especially the coconut cake. Can't wait to return for pizza, the bolognese sauce, & Italian wines."}
{"text":"We stumbled on to this restaurant looking for a place near the theatre where we were going to see a play, WHAT A FIND!! Authentic homemade Italian food( my husband is Italian and knows good Italian food) !! I had the lobster tortellini with marinara sauce, my husband had the chicken piccata, both were outstanding. We ended our meal with a piece of homemade cheesecake, AMAZING!! The owners were there and introduce themselves. Such nice people can't wait to go back and take more friends and family next time!! It is worth the trip to Fountain Hills just for dinner!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for an early dinner, sat outside on the patio....  nice, but unfortunately the road noise was a bit distracting from the ambiance.  Inside was stuffy and very noisy, so outside was a better choice,
The flat bread and garlic balls bread basket was good, served warm.
Now the main course, my husband ordered linguini and clams... When it came, he honestly said \"we need to go to McDonald's\". The portion was incredibly small.... We counted 7 small, super tiny clams.... and maybe a half cup of linguini.
I ordered the chicken marsala, it was a good size portion, huge compared to the linguini, flavorful and tastefully done.  I shared my food with my husband and skipped McDonald's.  
Service was super slow....
Not sure we would go back with do many other places to try."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been wanting to come here after we saw their episode on Restaurant Impossible. We finally made it April 9th for my wife's birthday. The server was helpful in selecting or order. We started with a Cesar salad which the server said was enough for two and he was right.  We each had two servings of salad. Wifely ordered the veal piccata and I the veal Parmesan. It was absolutely delicious. We wanted to stay for desert but this being a Saturday night the restaurant was extremely noisy so we ordered a tiramisu to go as we could not handle the noise level anymore. The restaurant needs some noise abatement material to soak up the level of the conversations  I would love to go back but never would on a weekend. I'll have to try an early dinner on a week night. Don't write this restaurant off because of the noise level, instead plan your dinner here on a time when they are slower and I'm sure you will be rewarded with a great dinner."}
{"text":"Awesome meal, fresh homemade authentic Sicilian.  Attentive friendly service.  Ask for Maria, she is so sweet! Beautiful murals, relaxed yet fun atmosphere - you have to try it!!!!"}
{"text":"Although there were a few minor problems, this place produces wonderful pizza.  We started our meal with a wine and small bites special.  The wine was pretty good but the server indicated that the small bites included meatballs but included fried raviolis instead.  I think it is generally bad form to make such substitutions without informing the customer ahead of time.  The fried mozzarella and zucchini were not very good.  The breading was very oily, as if the oil temperature was too low, and not flavorful.  The marinara was fresh tasting, but needed additional seasoning.  The pizza was very good, simply done and cooked to perfection.  We had the arugula, prosciutto, and Parmesan pizza.  It was very tasty, but could have used a bit more salt.  I also would consider putting the pizza back in the oven for just a few seconds to wilt the arugula.  The crust is good, not the amazing sourdough that you might get at Bianco's, but much better than some other pizza places in Scottsdale.  The interior of the restaurant is very comfortable and nicely decorated.  The many bar seats and well-spaced tables make for a nice dining experience.  Overall, this is a great place and worth a return visit.  While not the best pizza in town, it is certainly close and with a few tweaks it could be close to the best."}
{"text":"This place is great!!!  The food is amazing and the quantities are large.   I can say it is one of the best Caesar salads I've had.   The family owned business is great and the come by and chat with you."}
{"text":"Randomly chose to stop here on a trip out to the McDowell Mountain Regional Park, and I'm glad we did.  The atmosphere was great and patio seating was pleasant, especially at this time of the year.  We had good service, with visits from our server coming at appropriate times in the meal without being overbearing.  The veal marsala was outstanding, with excellent flavors and textures.  My friend had the linguine pescatore, which was amazing.  I only tried one bite, but it was delicious.  She loved it.

We learned after the meal that all the recipes are original to the owner/operator, and that he often makes the pastas and cheeses himself.  The pizza was also highly recommended, although we did not try it.  The people were quite cordial, which enhanced the experience even more.  We dined around 8:30pm on a Saturday, which I guess is sometimes busy depending on the weekend and what is happening in the surrounding Fountain Hills community.

Make no mistake, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Nothing like a true mom & pop Italian restaurant ! Maria & Gasper
Excel in there own way ...Maria with her amazing desserts 
Especially the cheesecake !!! Gasper with his brick oven pizzas &
Sicilian specials of the day !!!"}
{"text":"Couldn't get waited on, bar staff could careless. When we got up to walk out the lady at the door could careless, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best restaurant in Fountain Hills and my favorite \"go to\" place for pizza. (And it's wood fired!)  The other FH pizza joints can only compete on ignorance, hoping you never hear or try Sapori.

If you want authentic Italian crafted by two authentic Italians (mom and pop) look no further than this small establishment with a good size bar and inviting patio, often with live music. After many dining experiences, you can see and taste the owner's priority -- not making fistfuls of cash, but making quality food with quality ingredients.  Every dish I've ever had has been exceptional, and the price, borderline inexpensive.

As for the owner's temperaments which a few have mentioned, my guess it is part of the secret behind their success. This place is jammed packed in the winter, and by FH's standards, pretty busy in the summer as well.  Providing consistent quality and service in a hectic \"always crowded\" environment that has no shortage of fickle customers, isn't easy, and yea, sometimes it can be unnerving.  To expect an \"always on\" smile from an owner is impossible. Perhaps the owner's demand for perfection is the reason why this place is so darn good.   

If you live in Scottsdale, it's worth the trip up Shea.  Mesa?  Head on up the Beeline.  And then revel in the goodness."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night there with my boyfriend ! 
We both had the specials which we should have shared !
So delicious we didn't ...thank you Chef Habby for amazing dishes once again ! 
Maria for your outstanding cream puffs & cheesecake ...
A must try in the Fountain Hills area ...
Open Tues through Sunday night !
Gasper & Maria put so much love into this restaurant & always make you feel like family !
Also great happy hour in bar area :)"}
{"text":"Excellent!  We consistently have the most amazing pizza, lasagna, desserts.  When we arrive in Phoenix we head straight to Sapori. Thank you Gasper, Maria and David."}
{"text":"Love this place! We are here from Angels Camp CA, Our friends that are also from Angels Camp Ca that are staying close to Fountain Hills discovered Sapori D'Italia restaurant and told us about it. We went to dinner last nigh the food was wonderful. We had the Chicken Piccata, Chicken Marsala, and the Veal Parmesan, we all tasted each others dish and all were fantastic. The salads were delicious, and the wine was wonderful. We met Maria the owner and her son David who was our waiter, both were very kind and friendly, Maria came over often to check on us and told us her story on beginning the restaurant, lovely lady. She then offered us her homemade Cannoli which was delicious. Can't wait to Go back! This now has been added to my list of favorite places to eat in Az. Thank You Maria and David for the good food and warm welcoming."}
{"text":"We love Sapori!!   This is a wonderful, family-run Italian restaurant - excellent food and drink, friendly owners and staff, great atmosphere.  The lasagna  is delicious, as is the pizza, chicken marsala, and everything else on the menu!!  The cheesecake is absolutely amazing.  We had our son's 21st birthday party on the patio and they did a fantastic job of setting it up and feeding a party of 20!   You can always find Maria and Gasper in the crowd making sure everything is perfect.

Don't miss the music on the patio on Friday nights!!"}
{"text":"First time here, excellent pizzas best meatballs!! I love love this place!!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour! Love the atmosphere and friendliness of the staff. Just having a glass of wine and pizza at the bar is pure goodness."}
{"text":"I use yelp for all my choices when out of town. I have to write this review. Food is terrible not even average. Lasagna, and the plus two other dishes were all bad. How bad is this place their carrot cake did even make the grade. You go here good luck !"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, great service and desserts to die for!!! Great place to celebrate special occasions"}
{"text":"We were seated on their comfortable deck where we enjoyed a good wine with a delicious meal served by a very nice young man."}
{"text":"My wife was here a week ago and raved about the food so we tried it.   Average at best. Had the caprese salad and the chicken parm.   Serving sizes are huge but it lacked flavor and the chicken was quite tough.    I was hopeful based on her recent experience.  Not sure I eould"}
{"text":"Best Italian in the Scottsdale/Fountain Hills area. Love the pizza, salads and any pasta dish. We've been over 10 times and have never had a bad meal. Service can sometimes be a tad slow, but hey it's Italian! By the way call ahead and reserve the coconut cake!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for Valentines Day. Took a bit for waitress to take a drink order due to a large older group splitting the check 12 different ways. Waitress apologized and gave us wonderful service. Food was equally excellent. Recommend the cheesecake!"}
{"text":"On our drive from Chicago to Palm Springs we decided to alter our route to Fountain Hills, AZ to eat at Sapori D'Italia (saw it on Restaurant Impossible).  What a wonderful  detour!

The food was excellent.  Service prompt and friendly and enjoyed talking with Maria about the RI experience.  Wish I lived closer.  This restaurant would be one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Great Italian food and wine. Nice outdoor seating and good service. Popular in fountain hills."}
{"text":"It's not like this place needs another 5 star review, but... they deserve it.  I've been going here for almost a year now. This place has the best pizza. As a point of reference, I've sampled lots of pizza in Italy, I've tried the award winning pizza at Pizzeria Bianco (winner of James Beard award), and I am no stranger to excellent Italian food.  So believe me when I say, their pizza is the best! The owners are very hands on and are the type of people who make an extra effort to say hello to everyone.  They take pride in their restaurant.  Service is usually slow; but the food is always excellent. As an added bonus, their deserts are all handmade.  The thing I love the most... this is a family owned restaurant and they bust their tail trying to keep up with the demand. I love when I can support local merchants and sample things not available from chain restaurants.  I highly recommend this place. In fact, it's Saturday night and I'm in the mood for a great pizza."}
{"text":"Great place to go for \"Happy Hour\" 4:00 to close.  Only bad thing is that \"happy hour\" is only available at the bar (maybe seating for 10-12)and a couple of high tables near the bar.  Staff was great, gal bartending was very busy but managed to interact with patrons and was very nice.   Nice outdoor dining area."}
{"text":"Every single item we ordered was bursting with flavor. My family agreed this was the best meal we've eaten in a long time and the best Italian ever. 

To start, we were presented with a bowl of flatbread brushed with herbs and olive oil and garlic knots. We knew with the first bite that we were in for a quality meal.

To drink, I ordered the house Pino Grigio and my husband ordered a porter on tap. 

We ordered the calimari appetizer. Perfection. Fresh, not overly chewy, and bright with marinara and a squeeze of lemon.

My daughter ordered a bowl of kids pasta, penne and marinara. She enjoyed it thoroughly.

My husband had the seafood linguine and was ooo-ing and ahh-ing with every bite. 

My son and I shared the white pizza with creamy parmigiana, artichoke and spinach. It was magical, especially with lemon drizzled on top.

For dessert--we should have but we did--we ordered a slice of the chocolate cake. It was very rich and not overly sweet. It was a little dry to be honest, but that didn't stop us from eating it. In hindsight we should have tried the cheesecake.

The service was exceptional. Everyone was so friendly. We were even brought a bit a pizza dough to play with! My daughter thought it was a little silly but we got over it and played with it anyway. 

It's clear that this establishment has a lot of pride in ownership. From the decor, to the service to the food. This is a five star place!"}
{"text":"Let me compliment the chef and staff!! We were going to try another restaurant based on reviews and recommendations from hotel, but as we drove passed I could not forget the excellent meal we had last month, and my car veered into the parking lot! May I say I am so happy we did! My mother is going through chemo treatments and a few moments of culinary bliss were in order! Again both entrees were excellent ( veal piccata & pan seared beef tender with mushroom veal sauce and risotto ) heavenly!!! We could not help our selfs but to order the lemon cheesecake(2nd time) and the red velvet cake which was so wonderful we had to take some home! Last but not least, don't forget to have some illy coffee, my fav!!"}
{"text":"This was fantastic and flavorful Italian food. The decor is charming and there is a gorgeous wood fire pizza oven in plain view from the dining area. I had the eggplant parmigiana and it was so delicious. The eggplant was crispy on the outside and had melted HOMEMADE mozzarella on top. My only complaint was the drink menu. I know wine is traditional but we were not offered any other adult drinks and I would have loved a spritzer or cocktail of some sort to enjoy while we waited for our meal and had bread. The owners were incredibly gracious, friendly, and welcoming. It was a great experience and I'd definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Gasped and Maria take pride in making certain everything they serve is freshly baked and prepared. Great lasagna and don't miss out on the coconut cake!"}
{"text":"I loved it!! My husband is from Naples and Maria was a gem from the minute we walked through the door!  She knew exactly how to interact with him and that made me SO happy!  Seriously, I LOVED the ambiance and the food and my husband is a tough critic!  

Fountain Hills is a beautiful place and Sapori D'Italia will be our place head that direction again!! Thanks for making us feel at home Maria!"}
{"text":"Good food:) I am sure some are wondering what the heck!!!! She says good food but then gives 3 stars..... 
food is good but if at 7 pm you run out of food options  that in my view is poor planning. We ordered the red wine be (cab), the server says we are out of that wine.... well no big deal we got house wine instead of the bottle. Then I ordered sea food risotto and the server says to us I am sorry  we ran out of that dish..... ok so I order another hanger steak and she comes out and says there is no risotto so we can either do vegetables or pasta. Anyways I order steak with vegetables. I look at the time and it is 7pm.  How can a restaurant run out of food by 7pm!!!! As I was leaving the restaurant the lady at the front asked me how was the food, and I said food was good but my only complain is you ran out of my food choice way too early in the evening. She was super sweet and said well, then you have to come back again:) sure but what is the guarantee you will not run out of my option again!!! 7 pm is too early in the evening for any restaurant to say \" oh sorry we ran out of it\"."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I have frequent ed this restaurant many times and food is very good. That said I was appalled at how we were treated tonight I have never been treated so rudely  from an establishment that takes my money and makes their living off of customer service. (And I'm originally from NY where I've experienced rude) Apparently this establishment is closed on Mondays. They were having a special event-however- no notification was posted. So we went in. Ordered drinks- expecting happy hour pricing. Served us/charged us full price and after we paid actually yelled \"get out\". Could it have been handled better- absolutely. If we had politely been asked to leave or explained the situation- we would have left. If you are  considering this restaurant I would go to Casa Mia on 136th. You would think local restaurants would want to encourage local clientele. Not Maria this spot. Maybe bad day, but to outright yell is unacceptable."}
{"text":"The best of the best when it comes to Italian! The wood-fired pizzas use only the best ingredients - and are the best for miles around. The owners treat everyone like family. If you can make it that far, the desserts - especially the coconut cake - are madness! And more than enough for two!"}
{"text":"I had the Pappardelle Bolognese and it was heaven in a bowl!!! I ate every bite! My server Nate was very attentive. Such a pleasant experience. Thank you Gaspar and Maria for your hospitality and generosity!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are big Restaurant Impossible fans. We live across town but have been wanting to visit this place since we saw the episode and it is the only location the show has filmed that was even remotely close to where we live. We were greeted as soon as we entered and given our choice of seating. Initially, when we watched the show I remember thinking it looked better before the renovation but the decor was very nice. Our server had a great personality and chatted with us a bit, smiling the whole time. We ordered the Italian Meat Plate. It was so big we could of had just that for dinner! It was seriously an appetizer built for 6. I had the Veal Piccata with a side of vegetables. You could tell the vegetables were fresh not frozen. My husband had a pizza. At first I thought maybe we should send it back so the cheese could be melted better but when I tasted it I understood why they served it that way. It was really fresh and light and I really got a taste of all the ingredients. At the end of the meal, Maria came out to ask us how everything was. We were very happy to report we loved everything! We even thought the prices were very reasonable, especially compared to the portions. In the past, we've been disappointed by restaurants that the \"magic of television\" has coaxed us into trying but not this time. If we didn't love so far away we'd definitely go back. Oh and I forgot to mention, if you buy a bottle of wine and don't finish it you can take it home with you. What a great perk!"}
{"text":"I'll definitely be making this restaurant a frequent stop. The service was amazing, from the hostess, who got a table cleared for us quickly so we could sit on the patio, to the bartender, who made sure we got drinks in the few minutes we waited at the bar, to the server, who stopped by just often enough that we always got what we needed without feeling pestered. The food itself was amazing also, and came out astonishingly quickly for dishes that couldn't have been sitting around halfway done under a warmer. The bread was arguably the best I've had in some time, and the pasta dishes were perfect. I can't wait to try their pizza. And don't pass up the opportunity for a bite of their tiramisu!"}
{"text":"First time visiting after seeing them on Restaurant Impossible. It's a shame they learned nothing from Robert Irvine. Maria was the first one we met, she was not friendly. She didn't even greet us and 20 minutes after sitting down, she threw bread on our table. Gasper was not friendly either, after snapping a picture, he rolled his eyes and turned his back on me. The bartender was rude to the waitress. I did not like how he talked down to her. After 30 minutes of no service, we decided to leave. Nice decor, bad service."}
{"text":"I say 4 only because you have to factor your service with the experience. No reservation at 6:30 on Thursday they still seated us within 20 min or so. Busy and looks, smells amazing. Talk to guy in to pick up last piece of coconut dessert. Swears by it tells us he eats here twice a week st least and so it seems does everybody else. Friends tell us they do the same it's so good!  Good so far. Waitress touched the table 5-10 min later, app order in drops our drinks. 20-25 min later Maria touches table asks if waitress has been there to take our order, not in awhile. Waitress back 5 min later are you ready to order? Still no calamari but whatever it's date night. Calamari  arrived it's decent. Not crispy and little rubbery with no real seasoning. Lasagna and chicken Marsala-amazing! Overall patio was completely comfortable albeit lots of headlights and great price for amazing food. We will be back with a reservation to try the amazing looking pizzas going by our table!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Sapori! Back in September, a couple of friends were visiting from out of town, and we were trying to figure out what we wanted to do for dinner. One friend asked if I like Italian restaurants, and I replied \"As a rule...not really.\" She then mentioned that Robert Irvine had come to Fountain Hills for Restaurant Impossible and I was stunned. I had heard nothing about it! So, we agreed to give it a try. Arrived around 5, while Happy Hour was still happening. It was busy, but not so noisy that we felt overwhelmed. We were led to a table with a nice, low candle that was lit as we sat and was brought a swing-top bottle of ice water (very nice touch). We're grazers, so we ordered several things to share. First the Trinacria pizza - brought to our table in just a couple of minutes, right out of the oven, super thin, super crispy crust, with roasted garlic, fontina cheese and basil that lit the whole pizza up! SO very good! We then shared the calamari - beautifully battered, perfectly cooked and lemony; the meat and cheese board - which I could happily graze on for days; and the Caesar salad - with a very clearly in-house made dressing. I think I said \"I'm in my happy place\" at least a dozen times while we were there. Too full to attempt dessert while there, we ordered a slice of the chocolate cake and a slice of the cheesecake to go. I'm very glad we did, because each slice was a meal unto itself! Been back a couple of times to do take out pizza and each time it's been wonderful. I have yet to try the fresh pasta - but it's on the to-do list!"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian Restaurant!  Best NY style brick oven Pizza in AZ with fresh mozzarella.  Great new sauce with the calamari. Fresh hip atmosphere.  Drove by and stopped in during an episode of Restaurant Impossible from the Food Network.  Great work!"}
{"text":"Despite it being a packed house on a Saturday night, our wait time was minimal because we agreed to take a high-top table next to the bar.  We would be able to order happy hour items at this table. Cool.  We didn't know the person we were talking to was the legendary Maria, one of the owners.  She is also known as the queen of the baked goods as she makes all the desserts they serve.  She was very spunky and in a minute I knew she had to be from New York.  

We ordered meatballs and two beers using the happy hour menu ($5.00 and $3.50 for the beers-See photo of menu).  Nice. The meatballs were tasty, not dense and surrounded by a lovely light, red sauce.  They gave us complementary fresh, homemade bread which is made from their pizza dough and came drizzled with extra virgin olive oil.  DELICIOUS!  

We opted for the chicken marsala and the chicken parmigiana which both came with pastas.  The chicken marsala came with two thin cutlets and the parm came with one thick piece of chicken layered with fresh mozzarella.  They were both PERFECTLY cooked.  The red sauce on the capellini which accompanied the  parmagiana was light, not sweet, not vinegary, perfect---just the way I like it.  Hubby thought the marsala had a touch too much salt--I tasted it and didn't think so.  
I don't think I've had a better chicken parmigiana in a long, long time.  The portion was so big I had to take half home.  Hubby cleaned his marsala dish despite the complaint.  
The service was friendly and attentive. 
We definitely plan to go back and try the pizza which is made in a wood-fired oven.
Glad to have discovered this place."}
{"text":"They would not honor their advertised special offer! 

The appetizer combination, especially the bruschetta was excellent.  

The veal dish was too salty. The pizza was served about 10 minutes after the veal. (not what good restaurants do)  It was good, but average wood fired type pizza.   

Friendly staff"}
{"text":"What an absolute gem.  My wife and I were staying in a nearby resort and Yelped this place.  We ate there twice after a fantastic first experience.  Line was out the door when we got there at 6PM observing some chaos of a family owned italian joint. We lucked into getting a seat at the bar where were able to chat with some locals, observe the staff especially what appeared to be the patriarch of the establishment working his magic at the beautiful pizza over.   In between cooking up some fantastic home made pizza's the bread fired in the over and drizzled with olive oil and served right out of the oven. The bread alone was super addictive.  Watching a man doing something that he was so passionate about was fun for my wife and I to watch.  That and watching what appeared to be his wife barking orders around the whole place all night long was entertainment on it's own. The bar only food and alcohol specials made an amazing meal ridiculously inexpensive.  The muscles were amazing and the chicken marsala and chicken parm we had were second to none.  I would have paid double and not batted an eye.  Great atmosphere, even better food."}
{"text":"This is the place you come for a nice Italian meal in Fountain Hills, AZ.  Good wine selection, very good pasta dishes and the very best pizza (wood fired oven) in town.  They also have the very best cheesecake (home made by the owner) you'll ever get anywhere.  If I didn't live in Fountain Hills I would drive here to eat."}
{"text":"Service was top notch. Pizza was great. Pasta (calamari linguine) was fresh but bland. Environment was clean and pleasant. 

I went there with Yelp coupon for a 12\" pizza and a selected bottle of wine for $20. It is a deal. However they limited us to only margarita pizza which I felt a bit cheated. 

Overall experience average to good. Decent place but no as classy as I expected."}
{"text":"Sat at a table outside.   Perfect time of year for that.   The service was excellent and prompt.   The food was even better.   Pizza,  pasta,  & beef,  all were amazing.   The only complaints were that they almost gave our table away because we weren't all there 5 minutes before our reservation and my husband's pork (the special) was under cooked .   They tried to cook it more but still was raw.  So they brought him a beef meal free of charge.   Overall we loved our meal and came away satisfied."}
{"text":"I am a long time and very picky New Yorker who knows good food. I was in town for a few days and was looking for a good local place that had reliable salads and maybe a good pizza. Thanks to Yelp, we were directed to Sapori D\"Italia. Coming from New York City, and having spent a good bit of time in Italy, we were delighted to find Gasper and his wife's place in Fountain Hill. We knew right away, watching Gasper make the focaccia, that he was  an authentic Italian talent - from Sicily,  via NYC. The homemade mozzarella was terrific, and the Margherita pizza was simple, light, and flavorful. The crust was delicious - wood fired with a fresh pizza dough made with flour imported from Italy and nice and thin. Add homemade fresh mozzarella and fresh basil and tomato sauce and you have a classic pizza. Best of all, we enjoyed an endless Happy Hour deal with Barbera at $4.00/glass. Probably the best wine for the glass deal I\"ve ever experienced in the US. (You can get deals like this in Italy.)"}
{"text":"Some of the best lasagna I have ever had and I have been around. All o the entries were very good.  The bar was backed up so drinks were slow. Maria made things happen when brought to her attention."}
{"text":"As we were dining, the waitress came to the table next to us carrying multiple glasses and two big water bottles. She was not able to put them down asnd all crashed to the floor, sending splinters of glass everywhere, one of which hit a person in our party in the leg.   There was some bleeding and all the staff could do was bring a wet cloth and bandaid.  
No effort was made by management to alleviate any discomfort this caused.
The food was nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! Thin crust perfectly baked in the wood fire oven. Happy hour has the best prices but no matter when you go the ambiance is nice and the food is delicious. The freshly made desserts are phenomenal and you have to try one!"}
{"text":"I love the food here but the service is horrible. I got here about an hour ago I just got my salad and I'm still waiting for my second beer. The servers are not helpful or attentive. 4 servers walked past us at the bar several times before someone offered us a drink. It took another 10 minutes to get our drinks. No one offered us a menu we had to ask."}
{"text":"Just fantastic. Great attention, lovely place, outstanding food. I had the capricciosa pizza and tried the lasagna: out of this world good. The Cannoli was also to die for."}
{"text":"This is a MUST STOP place in Fountain Hills. The cheesecake is AMAZING - save some room! The cappucino was as smooth as the cheesecake! The waiter - the tall guy that ducks every time he goes under the archways - was super friendly and entertaining ... That extends to the two owners: making sure everyone feels like part of the family at dinner! real Italian food, wood fired pizzas - can't ask for more. Join us for happy hour Saturday - we are coming back for lemon cheesecake and some Italian cookies Maria is making special!"}
{"text":"When we got there everyone seemed like they were in a bad mood, we waited for like 20 mins before we had to ask to get our drink order. Don't order the piccata de pollo freshly made pasta with mushroom, spinach and chicken and brandy sauce. It's basically milk sauce. No joke this was like cereal! 2 stuffed pasta rolls stuffed with chicken, spinach and cheese in a milk bowl! It's wild. It was ok but it was swimming in milk it was not a sauce. Pizza was delish, large glass of wine served which was good, live music on a Friday night which was good."}
{"text":"First time visit, saw the Restaurant Impossible show and decided to give it shot...and are we glad we did. It was AMAZING!   The food was delicious.  We had chicken parm and shrimp scampi and we couldn't get enough.  Maria's homemade cheesecake was to die for.  Finally, we were lucky enough to meet Maria and Gasper and they are wonderful.  We will be back on future dates for sure!

This place has a wonderful atmosphere, great staff and amazing food!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Always Soo wonderful..and the new décor is Beautiful.. Love Maria & Jasper ..Warm Real people"}
{"text":"After discovering the unattrative buffet in the Fort McDowell Casino, we were scrambling to find a place close and that would serve us after 8PM.  I called Sapori D'Italia, and they were happy to accomodate us.  It's easy to miss the entrance to the service road, but you won't miss the fire on the building.  Our waiter, Eric, was very nice and knowledgeable, and we had two dietary customers.  A great wine list, tons of food and daily specials.  With 9 of us dining, we tried a lot!  They started by bringing us some bread hot from the pizza oven, drizzled with Olive Oil, along with a variety of sauces.  I ate the Ensalata Mista, and then the Eggplant Parmesan which came with a huge side of my pasta of choice - Penna with Vodka sauce.  Everyone loved what they ordered, and loved the ambiance and service.  If I didn't live out of town, I would be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is a gem that will remain with me for years to come...it may even be the reason I get on a plane for a return visit.

The first visit was on our first night in Arizona and I was not feeling like myself I wanted Italian food and my husband found this place on yelp and we decided to try it. 
The atmosphere is quaint and the lighting was perfect for date night or just a moment to relax and refresh. 
First came the bread basket...hands down it was magnificent and the best breads I have ever had. Homemade and different styles of bread with spices that were excellent.
Then came my lasagna...mere words cannot express how delicious this lasagna was...it has literally ruined me and I feel that no other lasagna will ever compare including mine and I make a mean lasagna!!!! 

The waitstaff and both owners checked on us more than once and they were just as sweet as can be. They recommended that we try the blueberry cheesecake that they had that evening and hands down the best cheesecake ever! Ruined me for the Cheesecake Factory!

Everything they make is fresh and homemade by the owners and I am just truly in love.

The next night we returned was my husbands last night before leaving me at the Mayo and returning to Denver. This time we opted for outdoor seating they had a live guitarist and a female singer performing, between the Phoenix heat, the stars, the red wine, my date and my dinner it was just perfect once again. On the patio there was a birthday party going on and the owner had handmade this ladies cake...some type of coconut cake that looked amazing. 
I told my husband that if we lived in Arizona every birthday party for the rest of my life would have to be at this restaurant. We will return one day!!!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to take my Mother and her friend here to check out the new changes... sadly the first change  of the noise level being so loud that you can not have a conversation.. esp.. if you are elderly and have any hearing issues.  the second was the food.   some was pretty good.  and some not so much. when we sat for a few minutes after our meal on a Sunday night the servers started to whistle...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It wasn't even 8pm.  We were not going to be keeping them ... and as we  left the staff that stood there .. not one of them said THANK YOU GOOD NIGHT!     I have to say  I did come back one more time to give this place a second chance..  because the one thing I did like was the salad.  I enjoy calamari as a rule however I must say... this calamari was the worst I have ever tasted.. not edible.. old oil and rubber.  I told the server that my Mom couldn't eat it and she said .. good more for you?  she didn't understand.. I got home and called and left a message as to the quality of this terrible disgusting CALAMARI  it was  bad food  cooked in old OIL  and no one ever bothered to return our call.   we live here in this town.    we wont be back."}
{"text":"so, like many of the other reviewers, my family (parents, in particular) saw this restaurant on Restaurant Impossible.

as my mother prepared to graduate from Grand Canyon University with her double major in Special Ed and Elementary Ed (can you tell i am proud?) we prepared for a trek across the U.S. for a mere 3 days, to force her walk across the stage in a cap in gown.

we made reservations for 7:30 p.m. on Friday evening and somehow, even after the long drive -- or what seemed to be like a long drive, hey! it's the desert -- we were early.  we were sat immediately outside in a corner table.  a party of 5 we ordered a bottle of wine as i tweeted away to Robert Irvine, the host of Restaurant Impossible.  ecstatic when he tweeted back to me, he told me to say hi to Gasper and Maria.  at the conclusion of dinner, we asked our server to say hi (i was fulfilling Robert's request, okay? i'm not always this toursity-- have you seen those arms? i'm not going to cross those!).  Gasper came over in his whites and Maria with her smile and glasses on her head.  as i showed them the tweet, they were so excited. you can feel the warmth and true love they have for the hospitality industry and how proud they are of their restaurant.  that, my friends, in itself is a great reason to dine there.

now. the food. 

the bread was delicious as i cheated on my diet the entire time i was in AZ.  2 orders of calamari later, with empty plates, we definitely enjoyed it.  we are calamari-loving italian family, and we've certainly had our fair share of terrible calamari.

my dad had the clams linguine. what looked like a small portion was not.

mom and sister split the prosciutto flatbrea pizza and my mom thought it was amazing.

GG also had a flatbread pizza that she devoured.

now, as for me. laugh all you want. if charcuterie is an option on a menu, i'm ordering it. no questions asked.  so i did.  i was pleasantly surprised at the amount and variety of meat AND they even had not one, but TWO cheeses on the board -- this was not an additional request, but many restaurants make you have the cheese separate. what ag great surprise and worth every.single.calorie (i just need to remember that at the gym this week).


post-photo, maria insisted on her homemade chocolate cake although we were going to forego dessert. oh well. i dont even usually like chocolate. and i definitely ate it."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Best Italian in the valley!! I have to have the Parpadelle every time it's soooo good!! Love the staff and the owners are so giving and good people! We come at least once a week if not more."}
{"text":"We came here after going to Casavino Winery and reading all the great Yelp reviews.  Typically I'm in agreement with fellow Yelpers, but this time I feel like they lead me astray.  The food was good, but not good enough to make up for the terrible service.  They were fairly busy, although not in a crazy way.  When we walked in the owner seemed more annoyed that she had another table to deal with than excited to have our business.  We asked for water when we sat down, which never came.  The food and wine was very slow to come out, and our server didn't come to check on us that often.  There were a few times that it felt like they forgot us!  There are a ton of great Italian restaurants out there, you may want to skip this one."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!!! You have to try it!!!

Our server was new and we came in at dinner rush on a Friday. We were there a little longer than expected but the food was totally worth it. 

Really enjoyed the bruschetta too!!"}
{"text":"We have been driving by this place for years and never ventured in. We finally did and oh my - fantastico! Had the homemade lasagna and eggplant parmesan, side of meatballs. Wood-fired pizza oven - as good or better with lower prices than our other favorite place nearby in Scottsdale. Our server Dana was awesome even thought she forgot our water - it was very busy so forgivable since she comped the second glass of wine for wife. The owner heard it was our first visit and came over to introduce herself - very charming woman. While this is a further drive than our neighborhood place in Scottsdale, it is worth the drive as we will be retuning often. We can always UBER so we can order more wine!"}
{"text":"We tried Sapori for the first time tonight. The restaurant was very clean and had a great atmosphere with some good live music. Our server Janelle warned us it was her first day working at the restaurant but this was hard to believe. She was friendly and fun and provided excellent service! We ordered the chefs sampler and Mont Etna pizza. The ingredients were clearly high quality and prepared to perfection. This is my new favorite pizza place in all of Arizona."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in Fountain Hills by far! Loved the food and the service and Maria! We will be regulars here for sure."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant with excellent food. Got the Moscow Mule to start off with the Calamari. Calamari they didn't give you a ton, but really didn't need a bunch. We got the special, which was pasta beef tenderloin with mushrooms and tomatoes. It was awesome which I had them spice it up!  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Was in the area for a play at the Fountain Hills community theatre last Friday and stopped in with a friend for happy hour. 

Can't beat the happy hour prices and it's always nice when it extends all the way to 7 p.m.

We sat at the counter in front of the pizza oven... the chef was friendly and the pizza was delicious! Bar service was slow, but the staff was very polite. 

I would go back again next time I'm out there."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  Gasper and his wife definitely have a passion for authentic Italian cuisine!  

The pizzas are hand tossed and the most authentic pizza I've had in Arizona!  

On another occasion I had a lamb Marsala with fettuccini which was outstanding!

The house made bread bowel. The house made mozzarella.  The pizza sauce. The Marsala.  All fantastic. 

The service?  Perfect. 

The atmosphere?  Well this place is super noisy.  The acoustics are such that one loud obnoxious drunk woman can ruin the experience for the entire place. I hope that's not a regular occurrence as that will keep me from coming back. 

Happy to try again!  And I'll gladly get food to go if the noise is a problem for me."}
{"text":"The best Italian Food, atmosphere, and service to be found inFountain Hills. Plus, the most wonderful deserts. Always a great time."}
{"text":"Flavors of Italy, you've now become one of my favorite restaurants in AZ. 

Authentic Italian wood fired pizzas, homemade pastas, mozzarella, focaccia and some of the best Chilean sea bass that I've ever tasted.  All this in a super cute restaurant that makes for a great date night and even has outdoor patio seating to boot. 

Be prepared to wait for a table on weekends, even if you have a reservation, especially during snow bird season.

Mamma mia si mangia molto bene qui! Bravi ragazzi, bravissimi!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Food and service are amazing! Wine list is outstanding! The salads are so yummy! Everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"This is my fiancé and I'd favorite spot in the area for dinner.  Family feel, amazing food every time and great service.  The owners take pride in taking care of their customers and make you feel so welcome.  They make everything from scratch & you can tell.  Tonight I had a friend visiting and we arrived at 9:30, half an hour after they had closed and even though they were cleaning up they insisted on reopening for us, that's service you don't get at most establishments."}
{"text":"This area isn't my neck of the woods....was coming out of a play nearby and was STARVING for something to eat.  Checked Yelp and found a few places, but the wife and I love Italian, so here we come.  Plus just a few minutes from the play.  Place looks nice from the outside, several vehicles parked outside on a Sunday afternoon, so it was a good sign.  Friendly greeting at the door and promptly seated.  The decor wasn't very complex, but it looked fresh, inviting...so we took our seats.

We reviewed the menus.  Nice solid classic Italian food, nothing fancy.  We ordered the salad with the arugula, cherry tomatoes, and gorgonzola to split.  Plenty to split.  The salad was nice and fresh.  A nice \"breadbasket\" was comprised of something like cut up pizza crusts from their wood-burning oven brushed with olive oil, herbs, and maybe a touch of garlic.  Yum.  A few minutes later, dropped in that bowl are some garlic knots, hot and fresh out of the oven.  YUMM!  We gobble up all and ask for more.  C'mon, it's too good!

After we finish the salad, the entrees arrive right on time.  The wifey gets veal piccata, which she says is very good.  I got mussels in marinara sauce.  We both substituted mixed veggies for pasta.  The veggies were carrots, broccoli, and summer squash lightly boiled so as to leave them al dente.  Perfect!  Everything tasted delicious in the tasty marinara sauce, which I'm sure would be excellent on pizza.  I only thought the mussels could have been cooked possibly so as to leave them a little more tender.  But they definitely tasted fresh.

For dessert, we split a house-made tiramisu.  This was the real deal, with good flavors of rum, coffee, cocoa dusted on top, and constructed with lady fingers.  

Our waitress was friendly, checked on us just the right amount, and came with the check in good time.

Unfortunately, we don't live near here, so it's not too likely we'll return soon, but I highly recommend it to anyone in the area.  This is excellent classic Italian food served right."}
{"text":"Returned to support the local business and also because the view from the patio is pretty darn nice. Only got the eggplant parmigiana.  I can't remember how it tasted.  There you have it.  Thus, although I dug deep but I just can't remember a reason to return. Should have just stuck to the dessert."}
{"text":"Their tiramisu is THE best in town/Phoenix area! Their pastas have gotten a lot better I think. The only Italian restaurant I would go in fountain hills!"}
{"text":"I am born and raised in America but to some extent consider myself and Italian food snob after living in Italy for two years. It's often hard to find a lot of really good authentic Italian food restaurants. Sapori D'Italia pretty much nails it. Went to dinner with my girlfriend and we both agreed it was delicious and would definitely be back. Staff was efficient and friendly and I was also able to have a nice chat in Italian with Maria, one of the owners. She was super nice and reminded me of some of the home cooked meal experiences I had while living in Italy. Anytime I'm craving some good local Italian eats, Sapori is top of my list."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place! Great food and drinks, very nice ambience, hospitable and reasonably priced, and definitely my favorite Bloody Mary's!!! The chicken Marsala is amazing and the seasoning is the best I've had. If you want authentic Italian food in Phoenix look no further. The desserts are the best part. All home made and delicious, do yourself a favor and come to Sapori D'Italia!"}
{"text":"Our family was in Fountain Hills during the weekend of November 16th, and we ate at Sapori D'Italia - twice.  It was fantastic!  The first night I had the seafood pescatore and hubby had the housemade pasta special - both were excellent.  The chocolate cake we shared for dessert was to die for.  Two nights later we brought 7 other guests with us, and again the food was great.  I had the scampi and my husband had spaghetti and meatballs.  Both were yum!  When in Fountain Hills, I shall definitely return.  This place is a winner!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner again last night and as always the food was spectacular!!!! They truly have the best Chicken Marsala I've ever tasted. It melts in your mouth. As for the service, it is still a big struggle for them. Kathy, our waitress is always excellent but she is only able to do so much with very little help. They have one busgirl but she does very little if anything at all and it is, in my opinion, the main reason this restaurant struggles. If they employed 2 experienced bussers this restaurant would improve on its service side exponentially. But I still give this place 5 stars for the food and the wonderful owners. Maria is always a pleasure and she always makes a point to stop at each and every table to make sure her guests are happy. Remember, \"Good things come to those who wait\" when you go here you will get some of the best food you've ever tasted, take a deep breath and ignore the wait. It's truly worth it. You'll see!"}
{"text":"We just had the most fabulous meal. Best shrimp scampi I have ever had, so fresh and delicious. All desserts are made by the owner, cannolis wonderful! The prices are very reasonable.  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"High quality, fresh, delicious Italian cuisine! I've had nothing that was short of excellent here. They offer an ample but not overwhelming variety of pasta dishes and other entrees, all of which are incredible. The handmade wood fired pizzas are perfect, and a hard to find treat in the valley.

Don't miss the handmade deserts! My favorite is the lemon cheesecake.

Maria and Gaspar are gracious hosts and will treat you like family. The staff is consistently professional, attentive and courteous.

Great place for families too. They always give our kids pizza dough to play with.

The prices are very reasonable for food of this quality."}
{"text":"Had Veal Parmesan and my wife had Veal Marsela Cherry Cheesecake with Chocolate.  Yummy. Still and always the best."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. Sit at the bar because they have happy hour ALL night at the bar. $4 good wine and app specials. Split the chicken picatta (SO GOOD) and had the Pinot noir. You also get thecwatch the cute owner make pizzas. Probably the best dinner place in Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"Good food for FountAin Hills.  The lasagna for $18 was over priced for a small portion. The chicken piccata with penne is a much better value."}
{"text":"Surprised for a place in Fountain Hills, its a nice casual upscale italian place. Food was really moderately priced and we were able to sample quite a lot for the price. I really enjoyed the atmosphere. I shared a dish of the sample appetizers and it was really tasty. Eggplant parm was really good and was not fried to a crisp like you get a most places. The star of the show was definitely the pizza, we got a basic margarita and it was really crispy and cooked well. Service was great and friendly, they always made sure we were happy and our drinks filled. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Been there twice after our favorite Italian place did not have any openings.  Liked it so much it is now tied for our top spot.  Had the seafood pasta the first time and the chipino the second time.  Both were incredible.  My wife loved both of her veal dishes.  Vary casual atmosphere.   Like the fried seafood sampler as an appetizer. Nice area patio dining. The inside is unspectacular but it is fun watching the chef make the pizzas.  The first time we went the service was fantastic the second time we could have used a little more attention but it was not bad.  The food is so good however I will cut them some slack.  If you are looking for a reasonably priced casual Italian restaurant with incredible food you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Snowbirds left, I can come in and get a seat again. Great for us but doesn't  help the restaurant.  Food is great, summer specials are awesome. The staff is fantastic,  check out summer specials, won't regret."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. They owners are very nice! The Lasagna is AMAZING! The Chicken piccata is also phenomenal! Beautiful atmosphere as well. I absolutely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Went here for husband's birthday and wanted to try a new Italian place.  Disappointed by some things, the server was slow and not attentive at all he kept our drinks with him until he was done talking to people he knew- 10 mins later...  Let's start with the lemonade which our daughter said was more tart than sweet- had to add sugar to make it drinkable.  The bread they gave was ok- although some pieces were burned.  Dinner- I have to say the portions are quite large- the caprese salad was good, husband's spaghetti with marinara sauce had a strange aftertaste, chicken piccata was pretty good, daughter's buttered noodles were good although how could you get that wrong..  Really wanted to like this place based on what we read, maybe an off day for them not sure."}
{"text":"Friendly waitress but slow service,  never got a Refill on our drinks,  dry meatballs,  small salad.  Def would not spend money here again. High prices to pay to get out tea refill for even a second glass of tea.  Waitress salad was huge and enough for two.  It was small.  Make your chicken Parmesan at home and you get better for your money.

*waitress was friendly but inattentive. Checking back occasionally would be nice.  Someone else delivered food so we never saw the waitress between the order and the ticket."}
{"text":"We drove from Mesa to Fountain Hills to take a very dear friend to dinner for her birthday. 
    We were somewhat embarrassed as it was so noisy you couldn't have table conversation. 
    The food was very good but service was just fair.  The house wine selections \"canyon Road\" were excellent except the Chianti was served cold!!
     A very good, and much needed, Italian restaurant in our valley.  I would say also very much a neighborhood favorite.  Something should really be done about the noise....it almost negates all the pluses.  I would go again but only if I could sit outside."}
{"text":"Back again, as we frequent this restaurant every time we are in town. Gasper and wife were in attendance as usual. I had the linguine pescadore and it was the best. We all shared the cheesecake with blueberries. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Sapori D'Italia is the best Italian restaurant we found in Arizona since we left New York. The owner Marie and the staff create an welcoming atmosphere which makes you feel like you've known them for years. The food is delicious. But you have to leave room for dessert, they are amazing! All homemade by Marie."}
{"text":"The enthusiasm for this place is puzzling as the food was average, not special and worth 3 stars.
It was a very noisy place. We could barely conduct conversation and thus I drop a star. 
Fountain Hills has Arrivaderci which is slightly more inventive and much quieter."}
{"text":"After a couple of months, tonight we returned to Sapori. The food was outstanding! The linguine pescatore was out of this world! The presentation and Kathy's service were A plus! They also had Tom Mein with the guitar and the mudic was great! We always loved Gaspar and Maria, but tonight we fell in love again!"}
{"text":"Was styaing at the Radisson at Ft McDowell. This place was recommended by the concierge at our hotel. We did have a large group and were happy that we were seated in a private patio area. Once we sat down things went downhill from there. Two tables NEVER yes NEVER got their food. Our reservation was at 6:30 and at 8:45 pm we finally left. Once they were not bringing our food out, they went into hiding. Never came back and offered drinks, appetizers etc. We had eaten SO much bread that we were sick and had no desire to eat. Worked out well when at least 12 of us never got our entrees. Paid the bill for what we had eaten so far and left. Would NOT reccomend this place at all!"}
{"text":"Wow what a great dinner my wife and I had. Gaspar started us off with a small bowl of flat bread that was lightly cooked and seasoned  My wife had the Chicken Marsala and I had the Angel Hair with Bolognese and sausage both were outstanding. Our server, Nikita, made sure that we had extra bread for our meal. My wife and I ate about half of our meal to save room for dessert. The home made dessert was huge and delicious. We had the chocolate chip cheesecake and the tiramisu of which we again saved some to take home. Sapori D'Italia would be a great place to take family and friends."}
{"text":"This place makes you feel like family!
The food, the atmosphere & the people are outstanding!
If your a New England transplant like me this place is a must!  You may forget your in Arizona and think your in the North End of Boston!"}
{"text":"Great food. Service is great (Cathy), but a place like this -- creating a high-end appearance -- should have cloth napkins."}
{"text":"Sapori is a great restaurant...one of the best in Fountain Hills.  The food is great, and the owners are wonderful."}
{"text":"Best Italian in fountain hills.  Only real option in town.  Love the great food items they produce out of their wood fired brick oven.  We have eaten there dozens of times and never leave unsatisfied.  Wish they had some smaller less expensive items. They are all big meals and a little pricy. Sometimes a smaller meal would be great but that's a very minor thing. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Sapori D'Italia has an amazing environment. The staff was very pleasant and made sure the experience was top notch. I ordered the chicken Alfredo and I would recommend it. It was very creamy and delicious, the chicken was grilled and seasoned perfectly. The portion was very big. Overall I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for some delicious italian food."}
{"text":"Loved this place.
Best pizza 
Amazing deserts
Great atmosphere 
Best Italian resturant in valley.
I true find!
a must go!"}
{"text":"Small little Italian place, only about 15 tables total. Family owned, huge wood-fired pizza oven, nice but casual ambiance. Food was excellent, service was meh.

We started off with a bottle of their Super Tuscan and the calamari app. It was good and big enough to feed 4. Our server overfilled our glasses and kept them too full all night.

Had the gnocchi bolognese and a pizza, both were excellent. Finished with a cannoli. (cannolo?)

So yeah, food was really really good, our server was super nice but he just didn't seem very experienced. Also, granted it was a Tuesday night, but we were easily the youngest people in the place when we arrived around 7:30, and we closed the place down at 9pm. So expect an earlier, more elderly crowd. We'll go back."}
{"text":"Very good food.  We arrived after 8pm and it was very loud.  There is outdoor dining area and had live music."}
{"text":"We thoroughtly enjoyed our meal at this restaurant. We were seated promptly, our server was friendly and efficient. Good wine list, excellent food and the tiramisu to die for. Would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The food here is so fresh and homemade one bite and you will forget what you were about to say!
It's so good it will rock you back in your chair and you will know you've discovered the best place to eat other than your mother's table. Lasagna was excellent!   So was everything else. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had just finished golfing nearby and were celebrating our 16th anniversary.  Searching on Yelp we discovered Sapori D'Italia and called for a table.  As we approached the restaurant, the aroma of garlic and wood fire made us both smile in anticipation of a great meal.  We were early so while we waited decided to have a drink at the bar.  We immediately decided to give up our table and eat right at the bar once realized our luck in being able to sit and watch Gasper at work making pizzas.  Through small talk with Gasper we soon were introduced to Maria and she was an absolute gem.  Both Gasper and Maria made us feel as if we'd known them for years!  As we completed our meal and readied to leave, we were wished safe travels and embraced in hugs.  Food was absolutely amazing but the owners will be our reason for returning!  Thank you for being authentic in your craft but more importantly thank you for making your patrons feel appreciated."}
{"text":"What a way to start 2016  -- tender, lean and delicious BBQ ribs as the evening special .     Sapori D'italia covers all the bases -  and never fails to impress."}
{"text":"We sample different restaurants every month with our friends. This time we came to Sapori D'Italia in Fountain Hills. The owner is welcoming and makes it a point to visit every table. Great wine selection and prices. We had the Bronzino Fish special, Eggplant Parmigiana, Chicken Marsala, and Shrimp Scampi with red sauce. At the end of the meal Maria brings out cannoli that are freshly made everyday. I recommend this restaurant if you are in the area."}
{"text":"5 stars doesn't even describe this place. We were waiting for a lil bit but it was worth it. The chicken canelloni was beyond this galaxy. Pearllisa was our waitress and she took good care of us. A must visit in Fountain Hills AZ. #authenticitalianfood #worldclassfood"}
{"text":"In the mood for Italian, we ventured here for a bite. Did not disappoint!

Clean and simple exterior, the interior had some lovely touches including a very inviting bar area where you can watch the pizzas being made. We were greeted and sat quickly, and our drink orders taken. The waitress took time to make sure we got the right glass of wine and beer, which was much appreciated. 

We started with a wood fired margherita pizza. The crust was amazing, sauce very fresh tasting. The waitress also brought us bread - one small garlic knot for each of us along with garlic oil pita pieces. We could have dined in the knots alone, amazing. We also enjoyed the pita, a different twist on bread with dinner. 

Our meals were all good. I went simple with fettuccini marinara. The pasta was cooked perfectly, and the same great sauce from the pizza. My brother in law got penne with meatballs and marinara, he really seemed to enjoy it. My sister got chicken piccata, she liked it well enough, but reported she'd have liked a bit more lemon to balance the capers. We all had plenty of leftovers, not just our dinners but also the pizza. 

I think the one disappointment was the carrot cake. It was moist, but the frosting just wasn't quite right. Honestly, we had so much done right that I'll give them this one thing. 

 I look forward to my next trip to Fountain Hills to return to Sapori D'Italia."}
{"text":"The best carrot cake, we have ever had. Took a piece to go, we couldn't wait till we got home, we shared the slice on the 30 min. Drive home. And we didn't have a fork either, that was the best part. Amazing."}
{"text":"I'm so glad that my husband & I had the opportunity to Dine at this Fine Italian cuisine.
The Best Calamari & Lasagna  in town- Delicioso.
Everything was so Fresh, Authentic & Homemade. This is Really important to us, being Restaurant owners ourselves we are often hungry on our days off because there's No good places to eat.. However, Our search is over & We're so glad about.
Gasper & Maria are the most gracious friendliest owners, They will feed you & treat you  like you are family.
This is Our New Favorite place to Eat..
It feels like home away from home.."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on our way back to Phoenix from Payson and this was by far the best Italian food I have ever had! From the appetizer to the dinner plates and then the desert, nothing was disappointing. We will definitely make it a point to come back here again. The staff was great too. Stop by and give them a try."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite Italian Local Restaurant... I am Italian and I am very hard to please for Italian food. We moved to Fountain Hills a year ago and started to going to Sapori once a month or more.. food was delicious and large portions! Well apparently that was not a profitable enterprise because a few months ago- Robert- Restaurant Impossible- filmed a show there and transformed the restaurant and it's menu to be more profitable.. I like the way it looked before- very Italian Village look- the transformation happened- it does look much cleaner- trendy and beautiful now.. I prefer old world Italian but I get why they did this.  The portions were cut in half and they somehow ruined the Tomato Sauce- the meatballs were overcooked.. They used to bring out hot garlic rolls with olive oil etc. no more olive oil and the rolls were so tiny I thought they were mini cream puffs and they  were ice cold.. The owner was there and she is delightful- her desserts are the best in the world-- I would go back for her Cheesecake and espresso.. The Calamari was good but half the portion. I had the pizza and it was just OK- It used to be sooooo very good-- the crust was tasteless- no olive oil on it it was dry and not good...
When we moved to Fountain Hills we vowed to support all of our local restaurants and we do as much as we can - we will continue to go to Sapori D'Italia but will try other items on the menu- I love the Show\" Restaurant Impossible\" and recognize what they did to help was much needed but I don't think messing with good home style Italian food is their forte... Service was great as always! Please bring back your old recipes!"}
{"text":"5 Stars is not enough for this restaurant!  Best Lasagna in the Phx area, hands down.  Made fresh from scratch, even down to the past.   Pizza is amazing, doesn't matter which one you order.  Chicken Parm - execellent. Gasper and Maria are absolutely wonderful!  They make every dish with love and passion and it shows.  Service has always been excellent. Atmosphere is wonderful and they have a beautiful patio.  We don't live in the Fountain Hills area, we drive an hour and it is well worth it to spend an evening at Sapori D'Italia."}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent. We had pizza and lasagna and enjoyed both. Great sauce on the lasagna and fresh pasta. Pizza toppings were quality and fresh and crust was awesome. Good portion sizes too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The owner was there, and made our pizza 10 minutes before closing.  He told us the lasagna was just made today, and the paparadelle as well.  The server also described what desserts were made today.  This restaurant truly caught me off guard, in a really great way.  A work colleague recommended we go, and I didn't read the reviews first... which I typically do.  This was such an amazing experience that I told me wife.  It's worth traveling for!"}
{"text":"SAD! So much potential, but missed it completely. Many times, when I first drive up to a place and I see 3 or more of the staff outside the back door smoking cigarettes I will hop back in my car and leave, but this place had really good write ups and we were in the mood for some super Italian food after working all day so we decided to give it a try anyway. We were readily greeted and seated, and water was brought to the table in no time at all. We had a few minutes to look over the menu. My husband and I decided we would each get a salad and then share an entree of linguine with clam sauce. I ordered the mixed green salad which was supposed to have greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and olives. I kid you not, there was only about one fourth of ONE olive on my whole salad and there was no onion whatsoever. There were greens, tomatoes and three half slices of cucumber with a tasty balsamic dressing for $8. What it should have cost was $4 at the most. My husband ordered the arugula salad topped with Gorgonzola cheese. The arugula greens were nice and fresh and the he enjoyed the balsamic dressing as well BUT his salad only had a minuscule amount of Gorgonzola on it ( three small pieces to be exact) $9  I must give credit where credit is due, their bread was really quite good. It was a flat bread that seemed freshly baked right out of their wood fired oven and then lightly brushed with olive oil and dusted with black pepper. Then linguine comes out. First thing I notice is there is no spoon served with the pasta dish. Well, I figured out real soon why there was no spoon because there was NO SAUCE (unless a tablespoon of sauce counts) also, about one third of the clam shells that were served with the pasta were void of any clams. One of the clams was still shut too. So, the tablespoon of sauce we did get was tasty, but really...how hard is it to add a bit of garlic, butter and white wine and put it on the pasta....there was no sauce! The whole meal was so sad because components of it were so good but then it was so messed up by the huge oversights. The homemade pasta noodles had delightful flavor yet so very very dry. I wanted to try the tiramisu for desert but by this point I knew what to expect so we passed. So very very sad. Bummer! It seemed like a restaurant that was skimping on everything because they were struggling not to go out of business. I would not return."}
{"text":"Sapori D'Italia is the best Italian Restaurant in Fountain Hills- hands down! This restaurant is owned by the nicest lady and ( I think) her husband. All of their staff is wonderful!  We always take my mom here for her birthday dinner.  They have amazing spaghetti & meatballs, Chicken Parm, Pizza, and so much more. Everything is authentic and tastes like you are back in Italy. Both times we have been there, they gave my mom a free dessert for her birthday. It really is a welcoming restaurant that has delicious Italian food. You should try it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, truly authentic Italian food!! I went there with my mom and stepdad, who were both born and raised in Italy. They said it was the best Italian food they had EVER had in the States! I couldn't agree more! It was so good that it made my stepdad cry, because it reminded him of his mom's cooking. 

They make their own mozzarella, marinara, and pasta from scratch. Yum!! The ambiance is perfect, and the owners & staff are wonderful, too! It was a great experience all around. I highly recommend the eggplant parmigiana, pizza, and tiramisu. My mom had the veal piccata and said that was excellent, also. If you're ever in Fountain Hills, you should definitely check out this gem of a restaurant. Or, better yet, make a trip out here just to eat at Sapori D'Italia! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant.  The owner's are super friendly and their food is delicious.  My favorite is the Chicken Piccata and their wood fired bread.  Ask for it fresh and hot  if it is cold. The owner is a great artist, look at the beautiful mural he painted on the wall on the patio."}
{"text":"We love the happy hour and daily specials offered by this wonderful local family business."}
{"text":"Sapori has been my favorite restaurant in Fountain Hills ever since I call this town home. I come here a few times a year and always satisfied with the food they serve.

During a cooler season, they tend to get busy during prime dinner time for snow birds but bar counters are available whenever I visited. 

Their happy hour menu is great and only available at the bar. Tuesday to Sunday from 4pm to close. I tend to order too much appetizers from happy hour menu and by the time my main dish comes, I get full. Happy hour drinks are great too. I have one drink or walk from home if I want to get more drinks.

Service is always friendly, they are just nice people. Happy to support locally owned business in town."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing place!  The service is like no other.  Right when we walked in we all could feel the amazing energy and love that these family owners puts into there family recipes.  We enjoyed the food, environment and most importantly the people.  So excited to go back, we committed to returning back the next evening!!!  Thank you. Sapori!!!"}
{"text":"You will not find an experience like this elsewhere! The food out of this world! Each entree is hand made, even the deserts! I have been coming here for 2 years and truly have fallen in love with this place and the owners. Hidden gem and luckily right here in Fountain Hills but even if it were an hour away I would still make the drive!

Love supporting small business and keep support in our local community!  Thank you Maria for always providing my daughters and I such wonderful meals."}
{"text":"Myself and my friend Soraya stopped here after finishing our wine making/labeling over at Casavino. We were starving after all the work we had to do ( not really lots of work but starving nonetheless) We noticed it and decide, why not? It's cute.

OMG!! This place was awesome!  From the time we walked in and sat down, everyone was very friendly. Our waitress, who's name escapes me, was fabulous. She told us about all the specials, let us know what was on happy hour, and even gave us her favorite picks and most popular dishes. We decided to order the appetizer for two which included the most amazing bruschetta ever, calamari that was fried to perfection, fried ravioli and the biggest pieces of mozzarella and tomatoes I have had in a long time. We also decided to split the Mussels in Marinara that also came with penne pasta. OMG it was so good and we had more than enough to share. We got pizza crust to eat before the meal and I swear it took everything in us not to devour it all before our meal came. We each ordered a glass of wine and I swear it was a very generous portion. Even better is that they the classes of wine ended up being on happy hour. SCORE!

This place is seriously a little gem. They have a cute little patio that is covered and has heaters for the winter so I can imagine how gorgeous it is in the spring. If I lived closer, I would definitely put this place on rotation. The portions were generous and the service was spectacular. If I am in the area again, I will definitely stop again for more eats. Seriously delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Back for another meal. The first time was awesome had to come to this diamond in the rough. Had the Chefs Sampler Appetizer. Crispy fried calamari, bruschetta, caprese and toasted ravioli. Delicious. I had veal parmigiana and Shawn had chicken parmigiana both with angel hair pasta. I can't believe I ate the whole thing. Veal tender, pasta perfectly cooked with a light marinara sauce. The breads are savory and hot and the garlic knots perfect. Our server Gina was awesome. Very attentive and friendly. After two visits now I can honestly say it is one of my favorite places and I dont have far to go!  Next time will have to order one of their pizzas-wood fired of course!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food, service, and atmosphere! I had eggplant parmesan that melted in my mouth. The chianti was a perfect wine to complement the meal. Maria is a perfect hostess."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is a must go to if you're anywhere near its location in fountain Hills. I'm sure all the locals will attest how great of a place it is.  If you like some authentic New York style Italian food that is made from scratch in store this is the place to be.   We had four people dining and we tried each other's dinners.    My in-laws both ordered the lasagna multi layers of cheesy meaty goodness.  The Wife and I shared woodfired pizza the came with a bottle of wine and freshly salad with creamy balsamic vinaigrette.  As if that wasn't enough to fill us we had made the mistake of looking at the dessert tray. Freshly made cheesecake three different varieties blueberry lemon and original cheesecake from New York style bakery, Cannolis and tirramaseu (sorry Siri is not wanting to give the correct spelling) are worthy of saving stomach space.  And if you are lucky, Katherine, a East coast transplant like the owners, will be your server.  She was always stopping by making sure that glasses were filled, the food was being enjoyed and that the guests were being entertained by her teasing of me.  We will be back on our next trip out."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to eat. We enjoyed the delicious food and live music from the guitarist. The service was great and the owners were so nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"Excellent warm atmosphere, good good, patio off the restaurant and amazing view of fountain. Great bar service, excellent staff and complete package for a nice lunch/dinner in this perfect hometown."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food! Best happy hour in town. Definitely worth a try!! Promise you'll love it!!!  $5 appetizers from open to close!!! You can't beat this place!!"}
{"text":"Great food!  We had pappardelle, lasagna, and meatballs.  The lasagna was awesome.  You could really tell they care about the quality and freshness of the food that they put out."}
{"text":"Hubby & I thought we would try a different Italian restaurant than our usual ones. We started with the combo appetizer. It definitely was not enough for two but we only wanted to sample things anyhow. The burrata cheese was chewy & the tomato it was on not ripe. Bruschetta was flavorful but hard & cold. Ravioli was fair. Calamari was good. As to entree , hubby got veal piccata. It looked awesome but he said it was bland . He's not picky & ate it anyhow. I got caneloni stuffed with chicken. The side veggies were good but the main dish was literally bland & tasteless. So I ordered a side of meat sauce to hopefully pep it up since the cream sauce had no taste. That was just okay. Also ordered a side of meatballs. They came out cold & hard. Sent back to get them warmed up but still hard. All in all for over $100 we should have gone to our fav Italian rest where the quality is great. Yes we did come in 20 min before kitchen closing but still no excuse. Besides it being VERY loud atmosphere is non existent. Furthermore I was sick the entire night. Hubby is ER Doc & thought it could be food poisoning. Will not be back. So disappointed."}
{"text":"We decided to stop in Sapori D'Italia on our way home from Payson and Yelp came through again.  Truly delicious meal with fantastic service from the owner to the hostess to the waitress to the busers!!  Our waitress was helpful and offered some recommendations.  I loved that they offered Happy Hour on Saturday.  We went for the bruschetta and meatballs off the HH menu. Then ordered a pizza. The crust was thin and crispy! Our food was hot and timely."}
{"text":"Our new favorite Italian restaurant in Fountain Hills, AZ. The service, food and ambiance are absolutely perfect. We go here every time we're in AZ for Spring Training and this year, we went twice in 2 weeks. I
The first time I had my usual papardelle Bolognese (perfection!) but the second time I had Veal picatta. I loved it! I could not have made it better myself.  A great neighborhood restaurant that the locals go to and we happily stumbled upon.
Our waitress, Amanda took great care of us. Marie wished us well and kissed our cheeks when we left. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My parents were in town for the Christmas holiday and since I have been to Sapori twice before and had a great experience, I thought I'd take them there for a nice Italian dinner. I was pretty disappointed this visit. It seemed like they were short staffed, but when you looked around there were 4+ servers running around, plus the owner bussing tables. Our server was friendly, but I think he was also waiting on the patrons sitting at the bar as well as waiting tables. We didn't see him much... My mother ordered the Chicken Parm and got Veal Parm served to her by mistake. The \"bread\" was served in ceramic soup bowls?? It was oddly shaped really small rolls..? The last time I was there we were served oven baked flat bread and it was delicious. We waited and waited for our check when we were finished and our server walked by a few times and never stopped when we were clearly sitting there after our empty plates had been removed. We ended up walking to the front desk and asking for our check there. I was pretty bummed that we had this experience, I talked so highly of this restaurant to my parents and walked out of there feeling kind of embarrassed. I wish I could give a better review for this visit, maybe the next time I stop in there it will be more organized."}
{"text":"Up north for a getaway weekend and found this surprisingly good family Italian restaurant tucked back in Fountain Hills. Owner/hostess was hugging about 1/2 the people who left, but treated us just as well. The fresh pappardelle with bolognese was excellent, as was the margherita pizza. We had leftovers, but wifey wanted something sweet so we ordered two homemade cannoli. Really good. I'd go here again any time."}
{"text":"Gasper has yet again knocked it out of the park!!!  He made the most amazing dish with homemade pasta, baby octopus, olives, capers, tomato paste, caramelized onions - holy cow it was awesome!  Then there were a few extra octopus that were served on the side with just olive oil and some lemon.  If you are not an octopus fan, you have probably already moved on from this review, but if you love it like my husband and I do, it was truly phenomenal!!!  You will never be disappointed eating at Sapori D'Italia!!!"}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed at Sapori. Homemade pasta is delicious. But the best is Maria's cheesecake.  Save room for dessert."}
{"text":"Have tried to give them our business for years. But they cater to Snowbirds and ignore locals.

I won't go into the blow by blow of the times where they were out of pizza because Gaspar sold dough to some woman during the day, nor the inability to seat us due to large Snowbird parties, though we used to support them during the dead summer season. Twice in the past year, no pizza after 8:30.

A perfect example of how NOT to manage a restaurant in a tourist town.  And don't even think about offering experienced suggestions or Maria will try to bite your head off."}
{"text":"We ordered the pasta bolognese and linguine pescatore and a salad. The salad was extremeley fresh with a nice surprise - a decent little wedge of fennel. The dressing was quite tasty - not overpowering - just enough. The hot focaccia crusties were excellent. The pasta sauce was good - not crazy good - but good. The linguine pescatore lacked pieces of fish, was more tomato saucy than soupy - not a zuppe di pesce I guess. 

We ordered cheesecake and cannoli for dessert. The cheesecake rivals any I've had in New York or anywhere else for that matter. Great cheese flavor - superb! The cannoli used ricotta and something else as the filling, but you could definately tell it was ricotta - not that nasty whipped cream some restaurants attempt to pass off. The cannoli shell was super fresh - crunchy and tasty. Both desserts get an A+.

Our server was nice - had to get used to his style - but quite attentive and friendly. All in all - this is a good restaurant. Nice Italian atmosphere. We will certainly go back again."}
{"text":"Fresh house made pastas, awesome cocktails, and festive atmosphere! Really good...will be back for more bolgenaise..."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever. Kids love the pizza dough Gasper gives them to play with while he makes great pizza!"}
{"text":"We visited Sapori D'Italia on a Saturday evening (9/23/17). Outstanding experience!  Dana our server did a wonderful job! We had the meatballs as an appetizer, the Lasagna, the chicken/vegetable white sauce pasta dish, conolli's and Maria's home made cookies!  The food was first class, the service was excellent!  We highly recommend you try this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food at Sapori d'Italia is fantastic.  Perfect pizza, lasagna and other homemade pastas, Cesare salad and a wonderful fresh salad with strawberries and orange segments. Be prepared for a fantastic dining experience --unless you are Gluten sensitive. On one occasion I was able to order a side of puttanesca sauce in a takeout order, but iba second occasion was told a side of sauce was not permitted. Since the restaurant doesn't offer gluten free pasta nor allows you to bring your own, as Tesoro Restaurant does, my reservations will be limited. Casa Mía has GF pasta and that's where we'll go until Sapori d\"Italia offers something for those of us with Celiac Disease."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I moved to Fountain Hills this summer. We have eaten here three times and each time has been exceptional. The owners Gasper and Maria are always mingling to make sure everyone is satisfied. Pasta and cheeses are homemade as are unbelievable deserts Maria makes specifically the cheesecake. We've had pasta, pizza, veal and seafood and everything was superb. Looking forward to going back very soon."}
{"text":"We ordered the mixed sampler as an appetizer.  You know immediately they know what they are doing when the tomatoes are seasoned.  Obvious high quality olive oil.  Wood fired bread and  garlic rolls  while you wait. Arugula salad was fresh and a generous portion.  We shared the mixed grill with steak, chicken, shrimp, and chicken sausage that came with creamy risotto done well. Atmosphere was family friendly.  There is an area tucked away for the romantic at heart.  I would drive the extra mile to come back here.  I finally found a fave Italian spot!"}
{"text":"Don't believe the negative ratings. Go, eat and be your own judge. The food was great (we had wood fired pizza), the service and atmosphere, excellent. Outdoor seating on a beautiful October evening. Great dinner entertainment by Scott Hallock who did covers of soft rock hits from the sixties and seventies. A bonus. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I went to Sapori D'Italia last Saturday evening and had a dinner that was incredible. My father and I split a pizza and the cavatelli bolognese, and both were incredible. The richness of the pasta with the rustic quality of the wood-fired pizza made for a wonderful dining experience that I would rate second to none."}
{"text":"This was some of the best Italian my husband and I have had in a long time. We had the eggplant parmigiana and the chicken parmigiana. To top it off the red velvet cheese cake was amazing. Tyler our server was really great also. We would return again."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Overly priced and boring except for bread and Alfredo sauce. Pasta was overcoked and eggplant tough. Wasn't a good value."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Getting our meals after ordering took too long and the last of seven meals came 8 minutes after the rest.
I had the calamari marinara, the sauce was NOT homemade and fresh. It was served on linguini NOT the angel hair pasta I requested. The person ordering the pizza said it was only average. The Caesar salad I had was only OK. We would not return here."}
{"text":"Veal parm. and shrimp scampi were above average. Tasty Ceasar salad. Calamari appetizer was good, but a little greasy. Plate was a bit skimpy on product too. Ample portions though for the dinners. We passed on the pizza, but will try it next time as it smelled terrific and looked good too. We'll go back."}
{"text":"I held a position for 5+ years that consisted of constant travel. I covered US & Canada. The US division for the company was based in Jersey, so I spent a lot of time on the East Coast. I've had the privilege of tasting many of the best pizzas that the US had to offer. This is the Second Best Pizza I've ever had! Nothing even comes close outside of Connecticut or NewYork. A true Italian style pizza in Fountain Hills! Great family style service as well. How lucky are we..."}
{"text":"This is the restaurant my wife love. The food is excellent. The scampi is fantastic. Atmosphere is a little noisy... not everything can be perfect.... If you like quiet eating, order ahead and head for home!"}
{"text":"Always the best Authentic Italian food in the valley. Family owned and operated with great service."}
{"text":"I was not really expecting to find good restaurants in Fountain Hills but I was pleasantly surprised. I actually found a couple great places, one of them being Sapori D'Italia.

The boyfriend and I visited Sapori on a Sunday night. It was busy but we got a table right away.

It was a little loud but overall the atmosphere was comfortable and our waitress was great - very friendly.

We couldn't decide between pizza and pasta so we got both - especially after we learned that we could do a half and half pizza. I can't remember the names of the pizzas but essentially we got half pepperoni and half prosciutto and arugala. For the pasta we ordered fettuccini with bolognese sauce. 

The food came out very fast. First the pizza, then the pasta. Both were excellent. The pizza had ample toppings and the crust was nice and crispy. The pasta was tender and the sauce was awesome. Normally I don't like a ton of tomato sauce on my pasta but this was an exception. This was sop it up with a piece of bread good. It really hit the spot.

I would definitely go back next time I'm in the area. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Delizioso! Love Sapori D'Italia - and even more so because I can support local businesses in Fountain Hills.

I've been here several times since moving in 2010, and most recently, about 4 weeks ago. I see they have redone their dining room - such a nice, inviting change. Love the color scheme. Feel like I'm sitting in a family member's dining room. 

I'm a bit of a creature of habit and always seem to order their calzones. Why? Because it works for me and meets my needs. That's why. I feel like I have a 10-pound brick in belly post-consumption, but that's my choice. This only happens when I'm craving Italian/heavy foods. 

Noise level in dining room is up there, just because it isn't a huge space either. Plus my ears are a tad sensitive.

I dig their fire torch outside of their entrance too -love how it looks at night. Fancy-schmancy!

Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We love this place and have become regulars.  It's our new go-to and only a mile away from home!  Fresh ingredients, wood-fired pizza is amazing."}
{"text":"The food was very delicious. I had a clam pasta and a prosciutto pizza. Both were delicious. I'll have to come here again!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Best Italian food in AZ! The lasagna is to die for!The owners Maria and Gasper are the sweetest people! Had a wonderful bartender Nicole too!  Very warm and welcoming environment! Don't forget dessert! The cheesecake is amazing!!! Followed them from their old Phoenix location, well worth the drive!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have lived in Fountain Hills for 8 months now and have been by this restaurant several times. We had heard from other locals that it was a good place to eat and that their cheesecake was to die for. Then, of course, we did happen to see the restaurant featured on Food Network's \"Restaurant Impossible\" so I was a bit curious to try it out. A few weeks ago, we decided to go out for a nice dinner and chose Sapori D'Italia. The server was very attentive and friendly, and she was able to answer any questions we had about the menu items. Our food was quite good. My husband had the Chicken Parmiggiana and I had the Trianacria wood fired pizza (with roasted garlic, fontina, sundried tomatoes, and basil). I am a pizza lover and it did not disappoint - it was an outstanding combination of ingredients. The homemade cheesecake that we'd heard about certainly lived up to the hype - my husband and I agreed it was probably the best cheesecake we have ever had (hands down better than the Cheesecake Factory). This is a cute little restaurant with very good food and overall made for a very pleasant dining experience. We will certainly eat here again."}
{"text":"My parents had eaten here before its makeover by Restaurant Impossible, and they were interested in checking it out again, so we went to dinner here on Tuesday night.

The decor was nice but it was very loud--we had to shout at each other to hear and it wasn't even very crowded. I wished we had sat outside.

 I noticed that the restaurant seemed understaffed or perhaps it was just that our server was inexperienced. Our server was hardly there. We were brought water very quickly (by a busser or host) after being seated, but did not see a server for quite some time. We put our dinner orders in on her first visit  to the table, but we hadn't chosen what to have to drink. I told our server I was going to pick out a wine, expecting her to check right back, but she didn't. Our food was delivered by a food runner and we ordered our drinks then. 

After we got our meals, she didn't check back with us for quite some time, even when she was with the tables next to us. This tells me she was new at serving (and not down with multi-tasking yet. I remember that vaguely from when I first started waiting tables).

I ordered the chicken ossobuco because the description in the menu was delightful (braised chicken legs with roast herb pan sauce over mushroom risotto). Unfortunately, the flavors weren't very subtle and the risotto was greasy--plus, it had a yellow cheese on it, which turned me off. The chicken was good, though, and I got to share it with my dad, who only ordered a salad.

The others in my group, by the way, enjoyed the food more than I did. My cousin had the pizza gattopardo, my mom had veal piccata, and my dad had the della chiesa salad. I didn't taste their meals, but based on my experience, I wouldn't want to return."}
{"text":"Last month, I had lunch, after golf, before coming home and my wife wanted to eat out for dinner. She picked this restaurant which was fine by me. I was thinking of a light dinner, salad and appetizer.

The service was a little slow, and to my amazement, when I ordered the Calamari as an appetizer, they were all out. Not to worry, I tried to order another appetizer and the server said they were all out of appetizers. WHAT??!! Give me a break. For real...NO appetizers AT ALL!! This was a Thursday evening and not very busy.

So, my wife ordered the Veal Marsala and I shared a Cesar Salad and bread. The salad was fresh and my wife enjoyed her Veal. I would have given this a three star, but our meal was okay.

We'll venture to this restaurant sometime in the future. When you run out of all their appetizers, something is wrong."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the staff was very friendly.  The atmosphere was welcoming and charming.  I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family.  And the desserts made me gain 8 lbs lol"}
{"text":"After reading a few reviews my husband & I decided to go to Sapori D' Italia for dinner Saturday night.  We were very impressed with their friendly & knowledgeable staff.  Our waitress was also the manager and she was very helpful and informative. 

We started off with bread baked from their wood-fired oven drizzled with olive oil, which was nice.  We had calamari with fresh marinara sauce for our appetizer.  It was excellent!  The calamari had nice flavor, not too salty and the marinara sauce was homemade with little chunks of fresh tomatoes, not canned.  I ordered the pesto sausage pizza.  It was absolutely delish!  It was made with fresh mozzarella and pesto.  My husband ordered the salmon with lemon butter.  The salmon was nice but a little dry.  It would've been better with more lemon butter drizzled on top of the salmon.  

It was overall a delightful experience and we look forward to our next dinner there with our friends."}
{"text":"We held my company holiday party here and the experience was amazing.  After meeting with the owners over the last month, we opted to have the party on a night the restaurant is usually closed (Monday) and had the restaurant all to ourselves.  The owners, Gasper and Maria, put on a cooking demonstration of each course.  The food was excellent.  It was truly a great experience."}
{"text":"Unbelievably good. Everything home made. Steak the best we've had outside of a $60 steakhouse. Incredible value . Great service. All in all quite spectacular"}
{"text":"We've been regular customers since they first opened. As as fans of Pizzeria  Bianca and Grazzie, but not always up for the drive, we are entirely satisfied with the pizzas here. Friendly atmosphere and consistent quality are hallmarks. Service can be a little uneven, but they always manage to pull it off under Maria's watchful eye. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Service, food, wine, and staff! Best thing in fountain hills! We ordered pizza, pasta, wine, and one of every dessert. Blueberry cheese cake is fresh, light, and so tasty! You will not regret coming here! This is a MUST! We had our heart set on home made cream puffs, but they were sold out...so you know they're a hit! The owner is so sweet and genuine. She came to our table and made us feel like VIPs. Make sure you check this place out! Cheers!"}
{"text":"The service was below average. I received a glass of water that clearly had a large black item floating on top. The waitress never apologized and claimed it was simply parsley. 

The food was not that great either. The calamari was over cooked and rubbery. The pizza was under cooked, and me and my date both became ill from the food. It is unlikely that we will return."}
{"text":"Great service, excellent food, wonderful atmosphere.

All the food is very good! 

Must try the lasagna! Fresh, made in house pasta.
   Need I say more..."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!!  Wish this was closer too home!!!  Owner was fabulous!!!  Highly recommend!  Live music too!"}
{"text":"Excellent wood fired pizza that we had for take out. Looked like a great atmosphere (darker, cozy/romantic, a couple TVs, and a smallish bar area with bar seating and a few high top tables).  Good service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is definitely one of the most noisy in the valley. The inside has low ceilings and everything Echoes off of everything else so we chose to sit outside and remarkably enough it was even louder. They had entertainment out there and people were yelling to be heard over the entertainment. Most unpleasant. We would have left it except we had another person with us who wanted to try the restaurant. The pizza is pretty good and after that everything hits the skids. The pasta bolognaise did not resemble anything that I am used to it was just some red sauce and ground meat instead of shredded meat with a more complex sauce. The shrimp scampi had butter and garlic but nothing else no eggs no bread crumbs no flavor. Extremely pedestrian food. Food doesn't have to be complex to be good but it needs some herbs and spices or something and there was nothing interesting here. The servers are good and even though we didn't like the meal we left a generous tip. But I would certainly not return."}
{"text":"I went there with a friend last Saturday evening. The service was too notch and the servers were very friendly. I has the chicken marsala with fettuccine. So delicious. My friend had veal piccata with fettuccine and she loved it. We shared a salad, had a glass of wine, and enjoyed our meal. The cannoli we had for dessert was scrumptious. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Just had the most wonderful dinner! Our party of six all loved their entrees. The pasta, chicken, and pizzas were fabulous. Maria the owner is charming! We highly recommend Sapori D' Italia!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, with fast and friendly service. What's not to love?  Oh, and the bowl of bread they bring to the table...stupid good. Do yourself a favor and eat here."}
{"text":"Dinner there for my birthday....wonderful fresh pasta. The fettuccini alfredo with shrimp was excellent.  Fresh handmade pasta, succulent shrimp, and an excellent creamy alfredo that wasn't overdone with too much cheese like I've been served in other restaurants.  Then Maria brought out my birthday cake....3 layers of red velvet with cream cheese frosting topped with fresh red raspberries. The most beautiful cake that tasted as good as it looked.  Gasper and Maria make you feel like you are surrounded by family and friends and serve you authentic Italian that can't be beat!"}
{"text":"My husband, daughter, and I saw them on Restaurant Impossible, so we've decided to check them out. 
The foods were absolutely amazing, and the service was great!  I had the shrimp scampi, my husband had the chicken parm, and our daughter had the spaghetti.  Hands down -- everything was delicious! If we didn't live in LA, we'd be here all the time."}
{"text":"We decided to visit tonight for the first time in a year. Delighted to find tasteful remodeling of the restaurant, yet the menu contained old favorites and new recipes. 

The portions were generous and tasty. Our waitress recommended the evening specials and I ordered the Italian grill. 

We can't wait to make a return visit."}
{"text":"Authentic margherita pizza had gobs of real mozzarella, fragrant basil, and a simple crushed tomato sauce. The crust was salty, hand tossed and baked in a big wood oven. Friendly service squeezed us in without a reservation on a bustling Friday night. 
Wild greens salad \"Dell Orto\" was also delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"What a great find.  This is a wonderful neighborhood restaurant. The food is terrific and the staff and service is great. From the moment you walk in and are greeted by the warm, friendly owner, it is a great experience."}
{"text":"Four stars but with a caution (see below).  To start, Sapori D'Italia is somewhere between a neighborhood Italian restaurant and fine dining.  They have inside and outside seating, with the outside being by far the best, comfortable if the weather is good and without overwhelming traffic noise.  The inside is a little dark and a lot noisy.  

The food is flavorful, as the name Sapori proclaims, and the portions are ample to large.  I think the veal would have been especially good had not someone in the kitchen gotten overly-enthusiastic with the pepper, and on one of the two slices, with the salt too.  I like seasonings but not as the star of the show.  Too bad the menu is unimaginative; it's like they constructed their offerings from a survey of the twenty most common Italian menu items.

Prices are more neighborhood than fine dining, with glasses of wine being particularly reasonable.  Expect to pay $20 for your entree and $6-8 for a glass of decent wine.

The caution has to do with the service.  Not that it was bad, although our server was new and didn't know the menu (but she was willing to ask).  Actually we had two servers who kind of alternated, but strangely neither seemed to know what the other had done.  Still, everyone was friendly but there seemed to be a tension in the air, like they were walking on eggshells.  I can't put my finger on what it was, but it gave a slightly off edge to the experience.  Do they have a management issue here?

I wouldn't make a long drive to eat at Sapori, but if you are in Fountain Hills at dinner time, this is your best bet.  Hint: Make reservations and ask for outside if the weather is nice."}
{"text":"This restaurant was the BEST absolute BEST mom and pop Italian restaurant - but that was 3 years ago. The service was fabulous, the owners were pleasant and always welcomed you- the house wine was outstanding... but then word got out and more people started to come - which was fabulous for business... they expanded the restaurant, painted, renovated the bathroom... food portions were reduced in size and quality, the owners became miserable and rude (the wife is condescending and horrendous to the staff - you can't help but overhear her)... their only saving grace was their yummy garlic knots that are small pieces of rolled up pizza dough drenched in olive oil and garlic---- but now they treat their garlic balls like golden nuggets and instead of making plenty for their guests, they give 1 per person... and now instead of seeing the same servers with smiling faces, other than the sweet server Violet who is still here - they go through staff faster than they can make their precious garlic balls.  This is the last dinner here- time to find another mom and pop Italian restaurant ."}
{"text":"I feel like I have already left a review but I can't find it so I am writing again. My girlfriend's and I went about a month and a half ago for happy hour and we had such an amazing time at the bar. We enjoyed everything we had, the wines by the glass were nice but the highlight was the dessert. Anytime I go to a restaurant and there is homemade dessert by the owner, I want to try it, especially in an Italian restaurant. The lady who made the desserts was there and we ordered the cannoli with cheesecake and amaretto and I think we got a little spoiled by her. Who doesn't like to be spoiled by mom? It was DELICIOUS. All of it. I highly recommend this restaurant. I recall going another time and having a chocolate cake that was incredible. Pizza is good too."}
{"text":"We watched the Restaurant Impossible episode and decided, how many chances do you have to go to a place that's been on a reality TV show?  So off we went...

The food was actually amazing!  I'm talking lick your plate clean amazing!  Too bad it's so far away."}
{"text":"Liked the food, but very loud. The band was very good the waitstaff very polite just too loud"}
{"text":"Sapori D' Italia is the best restaurant in fountain hills! I had a specially made Kit Kat cheese cake and it was the best! If you have a sweet tooth, the desert is awesome! The food is fresh and tasty! My son loved the linguini and clams and i got their special which was duck. Awesome i would recommend this. The staff is great and they are very friendly. Place is clean and nice not too expensive."}
{"text":"Super great service. I love the homemade deserts. You have to try this place at least once. I will be going back for my birthday meal."}
{"text":"Really freaken good!
Some people think they know good food and some KNOW good food.
Only a few restaurants in the Scottsdale area have been up to snuff and this wonderful place is just that, wonderful!
Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I have only ever ate to go and never dined in. I love spaghetti  and have for 20 years. The spaghetti here tastes home made and the noddles taste fresh like they were made that day. I have lived in Arizona for 6 years and just discovered this place last month. I feel cheated I didn't know it existed sooner. Don't be like me and wait to try this place. Treat your self and do it now!!!"}
{"text":"The owners and the staff are amazing. There was a lady with blonde hair at hostess station who was incredibly rude. I had called and made a reservation for my daughters birthday earlier in the week for for 3 people. When we got there we gave our name and told her we had a reservation and she looked at us and said \" we don't take reservations for 3\" and then just looked at us. Luckily Marie stepped in and took us to out table.
The food was amazing!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience! Sat outside. Weather was perfect. Party of eight. Had reservation and seated right away. Nice solo guitarist provided good cover music. Had a couple of bottles of wine. Highly recommend the 19 Crimes. Appetizers including the fried mozzarella, calamari, spicy salami, and bread with balsamic vinegar and oil was amazing. Huge ribeye (huge!) and perfectly cooked.  Scrummy shrimp scampi served over angel hair. You get to choose the type of pasta you want. Others raved about the lasagna they ordered. Dessert was cannolis and tiramisu. Go for the cannolis. Delish espresso and sambuca. Family owned. Great sense of humor and fun atmosphere. Would definitely make a drive to fountain hills just to eat there again."}
{"text":"The beef tender was amazing.  Great happy hour deals at bar and bartender was great. I will go back.  My mother got the pizza with salami and capricious and it was amazing!!"}
{"text":"1st time there tonight after 5 years of being in town. It was recommended by a friend at work.  Can't beat their summer specials. Today was the pizza and a bottle of wine for $20!!! The pizza like my 7 year old son said \" was out of this world\"! He's quite the foodie!  Service was excellent! Overall, very satisfied.  We will make this our weekly stop from now on!"}
{"text":"Not only is their food off the chart delicious, they have a catering service that is exemplary.  We were entertaining 25 friends and made the decision that enjoying our friends was primary.  Therefore, it was an easy decision to have Sapori D'Italia cater our party.  We were blessed in having two outstanding staff members to ensure that the evening was flawless.  Accolades to Amanda and Tasha, they were the ideal staff and we sincerely thank them.  Maria and Gasper have a wonderful catering menu and the dinner was superb.  So if you're thinking, \"what did they serve\"...here goes.  Stuffed mushrooms, Italian meat and cheese as appetizers.  Salads included, Caprese and a mixed salad with Strawberries, Orange and dried Cranberries.  Main course was Lasagna, Chicken Piccata, Eggplant Parmigiana with pasta and fresh veggies.  For dessert we had Maria's perfect mini Cannoli's.  The take away from this review is \"Enjoy your Friends\"...let Sapori D'Italia be the star of a culinary experience."}
{"text":"Decided on a simple dinner: chicken breast in white wine and capers, the dry Chianti and Sicilian salad. The tomatoes were in winter ( after all today is Jan 3),  but all else was delicious. It's one of those unusual places where you can get unburnt espresso and a cheese cake that matches the NY, not mucky, jellylike or too creamy. The dishes were not pretentious, but ++.  This was an unexpectedly pleasant dinner after some good hiking on the Apache trail. We'll be back next time we're in the region."}
{"text":"What a treasure in Fountain Hills... Now I know a lot of you in Scottsdale probably went, \"ugh, it's so far away.\" But let me tell you it's well worth the 3 extra minutes it would take you to get anywhere else!

We were greeted quickly and treated like we'd been eating there for years! As you walk in you are surrounded by beautiful murals with neutral colors that just makes the restaurant feel big and open even at night.  

Wine list was simple and reasonably priced and tons of menu choices for dinner and starters.  We ordered the caprese and out came 5 huge pieces of homemade buffalo mozzarella nicely seasoned with balsamic on the side.  For dinner my date and i split the pizza with capicola and mozzarella!!! Great crust and amazing sauce!

All in all had a great experience and loved the fact it is a family run restaurant! We need more of them here in the valley."}
{"text":"Such a nice local, casual and reasonable restaurant in beautiful Fountain Hills, Az.  Have eaten their three times since their experience with Restaurant Impossible by Robert Irvine and always a excellent dinning experience before local plays.  Pasta and veal dishes always excellent and cheese cake dessert well worth the calories(take a McDowell Regional Park hike).  Service has always been friendly and efficient.  Have paid much more for Italian cuisine but never any better food throughout the Valley and elsewhere. Definitely recommend but warning, make reservations."}
{"text":"Went to this place after visiting a friend inFH. WOW, the food was amazing. We had a party of 4 and all ordered different dishes to share and not a single dish was unfinished.  A friend of ours told us that they make pretty much everything from scratch/fresh, and I am so happy I went. The food was amazing, and their desserts were especially OUTSTANDING!   Will definitely eat here again the next time I visit FH, AZ!

Oh, and the service was excellent. Looked like a mom and pop dine in, hence, very personable."}
{"text":"Maria (the owner) served us. Very nice person, but clearly a bit overwhelmed by the volume of diners. I enjoyed the RI show and think the place has great potential, but it seems some of Robert's advice has been disregarded. The shrimp scampi simply was not the same dish that Robert cooked up for a tasting on the show. It seems the owners decided to go back to the old tomato sauce that Robert found bland and uninspired. We wholeheartedly agreed with Robert and were quite shocked to find that even after his explanation on the show about the importance of that sauce, it was undeniably below average. People will fill seats in that restaurant for a few months to come due to all of the publicity, but it will not last long term if they don't address that sauce. 

Gasper was not where Robert thought he should be. He was outside doing pizza's instead of in the kitchen. Not sure if this contributed to the bland sauces in the dishes or lack of consistency. The place is too nice and has too much upside to take a turn downhill again after another 6 months to 1 year. That's where the business is headed unless the sauces are addressed.

The old decor was nice and the new decor is nice. The place is inviting and the people are friendly. The service was solid. It's really all about the food, which is simply not where it needs to be. There are too many good Italian restaurants around. The owners cannot tolerate bland food if they want to be around for the long haul. 

Maria's cheesecake - NOT BLAND! It was terrific. 

Pleasant experience overall and we want to see this family do well, but in this reviewer's opinion, taste is lacking."}
{"text":"I am from Chicago and 100% Italian. My mother was born in Calabria and Dad in Naples so I know italian food. 
Family is in the restaurant business in Chicago and I've been around it all my life. 
Sopori D' Italia  is a nice Resturant for fountain hills but the owners wife doesn't belong in the business. 

She is absolutely horrific with customers and a piss poor attitude that's my best  way to describe her. 

Zero personality. Lady you aren't in New York anymore so sweeten up. This is Arizona and people are happy here. 


Ok let's move on to the food I asked for my eggplant not to be fried and the the crabby owner said \" to bad we fry our eggplant \" and I responded by saying I want it baked because I don't eat fried food.  So she finally gave in after I started to get up and walk out!! 
Then I ordered prime rib from here on a Sunday and it was horrible. It was tuff and all fat. 
 Tonight I ordered chicken parmigiana and they made it the way I wanted but I ordered meatballs and they were still frozen. The sauce over the meatballs was cold. 

I will never visit this establishment never again they had numerous chances and don't care it's obvious. The owners are people  that don't deserve to have great customer base night after night . Very ungrateful people... I wouldn't go there!!

{"text":"I seldom write reviews but this time.  The waitress was horrible.  We waited a long time before she brought us water.  And, she waited on another table that had gotten there after we did.  Wine and food was served before ours.  Yes, the food is good, but that can be ruined by the bad service.  We have had other horrible experiences with the wait staff.  This time, we will make a note to never be back there again.  I also would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal here this evening.  A little bit of a wait but showing up at 630 on a Saturday it is to be expected.  Caprese salad with fresh ingredients was delicious.  We order pizza for the kids which came out first and they loved it!  Crispy crust and a sweet sauce that tastes authentic and homemade.  Eggplant parmigiana did not disappoint with a generous helping of pasta.  We took cannoli to go and those were good although not the best I have had. Next time it's cheesecake and tiramisu.  Will absolutely be back for another genuine Italian dinner."}
{"text":"Great food!  Went early Saturday evening to beat the dinner crowd.  By 6:00 omit was getting crowded, but not in a wait list.  Lots of bar seating and great service.  We had two different salads and they were fresh and prepared well. The fresh bread is awesome, coming from their own bakery on site.  Chicken Parm and Short Rib Cannelloni were fantastic.  Tiramisu to-go b/c we were too full to eat it there.  Delicious also.  Can't go wrong here.   Looking forward to trying the pizzas next time!"}
{"text":"I had a taste for spaghetti and meatballs I haven't had it in a while. Stopped here it was perfect also came with some really good bread two different kinds. I will be back quite often."}
{"text":"Last night I had the opportunity to enjoy some of the finest lasagna I've ever had. Starting with homemade noodles, Seven layers of them, produces a light decadent entrée. Combined with the atmosphere in the warm reception of the owners - - this is a not to be missed location."}
{"text":"Excellent calamari and linguini but overpriced and with terrible service.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"This is where you have great Italian food in FOUNTAIN HILLS!  First we were treated wonderfully. Service was top notch. Always checking for drinks and the food was great and fast. I didn't realize that they had a makeover several years ago.They have made a great place I had the pan seared beef w risotto.  It was very good. We also had the eggplant parmesan.  Freshly made! The happy hour looked like a great deal! Definitely returning and looking forward to having more dishes there. The cheesecakes are made there and are awesome.  Super service!
Maria spoke to us and was very welcoming.

And don't think of leaving this place before having dessert!  Cheesecakes,  carrot cake and other goodies! All made fresh!"}
{"text":"We just had a late lunch here after a long hike in the mountains. We were happily received and food was excellent. Pizza was great, help was very pleasant and all of the food made on site. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"This is a lovely restaurant with amazing food and ambiance! We loved the pizzas and pastas and enjoyed the small slices of bread on the table at the beginning of the meal. My only complaint was that it was really noisy. Otherwise, it was a great experience. We will definitely be back if we are in the area again."}
{"text":"So let me start by saying I only got dessert here, so I can't speak to the food. I was a huge fan of Gasper's when it was open, and was so sad when they closed. I was in Fountain Hills and thought, why not go get a piece of that delicious tiramisu I used to get at Gasper's (same owners, so same cake, right?). Anyway, I got the tiramisu to go and took it home. When I had it, it just didn't taste as delicious as I remember it being at Gasper's. It was still ok, just not amazing. So I probably would not go here if I were not in the neighborhood, but if I were in Fountain Hills, I would give it another shot."}
{"text":"We came in for a family Christmas weekend. We decided to try Italian this time around and came here on the family recommendation. We both had the Veal Parmesan and it was absolutely to-die-for! The best we have EVER had! The Sauce, the Veal...it was ALL perfect!! Which sucks for us because we live in Nevada but good for you if you are reading this and deciding where to go....GO here....NOW! No more questions .. just go! You'll be amazed!"}
{"text":"First time there - went before a play the other night.

Nice lively place. Vey nice people.

Food just OK. Looked like wonderful bread and flatbreads, but they were not warm, like I expected and thought should be. Mixed appetizer platter nothing special. Eggplant parmigiana just ok, but they got the angel hair pasta fine. My wife had Chicken Picata. Tender, flavorful, but a small portion.

Shared a bottle of house Chianti for 3 of us. $70 per couple oveall seems pricey for what it is. But not being familiar with Fountain Hills restaurants, not sure if this fair, or even one of the better possibilities there."}
{"text":"Sapori is rapidly becoming our favorite place for Italian food. Gaspar makes the best pizza my wife has ever had - even I like it. It is also great to watch him making them and putting them in the wood-fired oven. Their eggplant parmesan is the best I have had in a restaurant, and their lasagna was superb - also the best I have had in a restaurant. 
The wine and ambience are so delightful 
We LOVE it"}
{"text":"Arrived when it opened, but the doors were locked. so i called and dude said they are open right now! and he came outside to meet me, and locked himself out! lol. he opened the door for me, and on i went! very nice remodeled place by restaurant impossible. i have not watched the episode yet, and wanted to come here first before i watch to give it a more raw review. it feels nice and comfy. i ordered a pizza because of all the good reviews. and i have to admit, the pizza is good, yummy sauce, chewy soft yet has a crunch to it. i like the basil leaves on it, and the wood fire taste. but i'm sorry it will never top Grimaldis Pizza... and honestly it was a little to burnt for me, tasted burnt. i'm sure the other dishes are awesome. but they just opened for lunch so i'm sure it will get better. would prob come again. i would like to try some other dishes:) thank you sapori d'italia!"}
{"text":"We are from the northeast and have had the pleasure of dining at the North End in Boston.  If you have been there you know that is the best Italian seafood you can get--at least in this part of the hemisphere.  Well this is as close as we have come to that.  Loved this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, generous portions, and fair prices. This place is worth the trip to fountain hills for dinner if you're in the mood for a homey Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service, and ambience! I haven't had lasagna since I was in Florence Italy!"}
{"text":"Omg omg omg coconut lovers unite. Sapori makes the most sinfully coconutty Coconut cake I've ever had in my life. Do yourself a favor and give it a try.  You won't be disappointed. So yummy!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST Italian food! Stumbled upon this place 2 summers ago and waited too long to return. True mom and pop restaurant but doesn't lack a bit in ambiance (hole in the wall but elegant at the same time) Pasta and desserts made FRESH everyday and you'll taste the difference. You will absolutely feel like family when you visit. The owners are hands on and ever present! Wish I had pics, but too busy enjoying the experience..next time!"}
{"text":"Decent food but over-priced. I've eaten here once and never went back...wasn't that impressed the first time."}
{"text":"Excellent choice for pizza, handmade, fresh ingredients, wood fired, perfection.  Desserts are also homemade delights.  Substantial portions for entrees all cooked wonderfully.  This husband/wife team know what they are doing.....great food."}
{"text":"We had driven by the restaurant in the past but never tried it.  We found the service to be warm and helpful.  Our food came promptly and was of good quality.  We very much enjoyed the calamari fritti.  We found the Caesar salad and the arugula salad to be of good size and quality.  We had the Etna pizza and our friends had the veal piccata and we we all satisfied.  We also found the prices to be reasonable.

{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant which we frequent regularly because of the outstanding food and one bartender in particular, Chan. The owners are have created a very welcoming and warm atmosphere! Love their special, happy hour and very reasonable pricing. Always look forward to visiting there"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant.  The food tasted very authentic.  I'm from New York and very picky about Italian food but this place was amazing.  Everything was delicious.  I had the lasagna and it was extremely tasty.  I will be back when visiting Arizona!"}
{"text":"My husband and I received the best service, food and ambiance at this lovely Italian restaurant- simply wonderful.  Cucumber salad, mussels, clam linguine, chicken Parmesan, cannoli and yummy chianti  amazing.  Try outside seating great.  There was no rush a nd we had no reservation.  Anything worth having is worth waiting for and it was worth the 15 minute wait for a fabulous dinner. Thanks Maria who owns the restaurant with her  husband and makes all the desserts. YUMMY!"}
{"text":"If there were more stars to rate this restaurant, I would!  We have been frequenting this restaurant for a few years ... and it never has failed!  Maria greets us at the door and makes us feel so special.  I have never had something that didn.t knock my socks off.  Maria is always having us a taste something she has made, whether it be an Italian cookie, cannoli or pesto, for example. The food, staff, ambiance and prices make it a fabulous evening!"}
{"text":"Just plain great home cooked Italian specials. Fabulous Pizza and the Tiramisu is to die for. Maria makes it every day.  Miss this place... Just plain great!"}
{"text":"Terrific restaurant! We've never had a bad meal there; but once we discovered their pizza, which is second to none but Pizzeria Bianco without the drive to a Phoenix and the hour-long wait, it's hard to order anything else. Sapori d'Italia is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Wood-fired pizza and authentic Italian food right here in Fountain Hills! My wife ordered the prosciutto, arugula, and Parmesan pizza. The crust was crispy and the center was not soggy. I ordered the eggplant Parmesan. To me, this dish is the deal maker or breaker when we dine out for Italian. The eggplant was tender, the sauce well balanced with just the right amount of cheese between. More importantly, the dish was not oily at all.

Major pluses - Obviously very fresh ingredients, the pasta here is made fresh, and the marinara sauce is extremely well prepared. The staff is friendly and the restaurant is very clean. 

I do wish that they updated their daily specials on the website. Had they, I wold have also ordered their mushroom and ravioli special which sounded scrumptious! We will be back!"}
{"text":"my family says the desserts here are breathtaking and you just dont get them that way anywhere else. pizza is on point. freshest authentic italian food i have ever seen. very creative."}
{"text":"I feel that Sapori D'Italia offers a very authentic  \"Taste of Italy\"...food that you would experience at a trattoria in Italy.
The menu is very simple, the food is uncomplicated and of very high quality.
Portions of very ample size and I would highly recommend to all.
Wood-fired pizzas are the mainstay of the menu, but they also offer several daily specials, with an emphasis on seafood on Fridays.
The restaurant seemed to be a bit over-capacity during the opening weeks, but I think they have a winner here!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place! Amazing brick oven pizza, to die for garlic knots and the best mushroom risotto I've ever had! Not to mention our waitress, Kathy, was pretty fantastic!"}
{"text":"got there bye 4 -430 pm. one other table in the restaurant however bye the time we left it was full so if you want to avoid rush be in bye that time !. very nice in the evening hours when sun is sitting great for dinner dates or other happenings.very friendly polite staff had pinot really good. And half spinch feta and parma my half was really great high quality feta cheese. I saw some of there desserts and didn't realize they had a dessert menu espic come to find out they had canolis ill try that next time. Overall very nice and friendly place welcoming deff. will be back"}
{"text":"UN BELIvABLE!!!
What else can I say?
I have traveled all over Italy and the U.S. and must say that this is one of the best Italian restaurants that I have been to
Maria (the owner) and Violet our waitress were spot on. Very very warm and accommodating
The pizza is to die for along with lasagna and capellini 
5 stars are not enough"}
{"text":"Great food overall..a little pricey but REAL Italian food..best ceasar salad dressing...fabulous shrimp alfredo..pizza is made in a brick oven right in front of you..so tasty!"}
