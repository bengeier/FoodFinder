{"text":"I've heard great things about the Anancy on the island of Montreal.  Unfortunately, the location in Brossard does not live up to the hype.   This restaurant has been open for about 4 months and just started their delivery service (which is very slow... give them a few more months and maybe it'll get better)  Pros: - Only Jamaican resto I'm aware of in Brossard - Friendly, albeit a little clueless, server - Clean-looking restaurant   Cons: - Long-wait time - The food just wasn't that great (we had the jerk chicken and curry goat)  Conclusion:  I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"i'm on a mission to find the best west indian restaurant in montreal.  i tried out this place about a year ago & didn't find anything really outstanding about them.  i'll have to visit them a second time before I really have an opinion on them, just to be fair..."}
{"text":"So it's been two years since the last review about the Brossard location and I'm happy to say that I loved this place! Although i've only ordered the jerk chicken meal. Comes with flavourful rice topped with some plantains and beans. The Jerk chicken is really well seasoned and tender. I stopped by the shop by chance and have been back three times!!! Take a leap of faith and try it the jerk chicken meal! So good. One thing is the coselaw, just regular (try switching it in for another piece of plantain)."}
