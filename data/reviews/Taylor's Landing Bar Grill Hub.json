{"text":"Decided to come here for a try. Seated in the patio. Ordered brisket mac and cheese (it's alright), fish taco (had better) and chicken and waffles (meh). These were dishes recommended to us.    The decor is nice, service wasn't bad but as we sat there looking at Joey's across the street, we kept wondering why we didn't just go there.  So save yourself the trouble and just go to Joey's."}
{"text":"Sat outside on the patio. The table and cutlery was dusty and sandy (due to construction near by I believe). Anyway service was pretty good. But the food was not. We ordered the lunch special one ahi tuna salad and the other one is a steak salad with running egg. The ahi tuna was crusted with this Cajun spice that was way too spicy and the spice was rolled on the fish after it was cooked and cold so all you get is a mouthful of raw spices powder. Terrible. And my steak salad the waitress asked me how I like my steak done and I replied medium rare and she even brought me a steak knife. And when my salad came the steak was in little thin shredded pieces that looked like it had been stirfried. Lol... what is the point of calling it steak or give me a steak knife when the meat looks like shaved beef slices. And the salad was drenched in this yogurt cheesy white sauce that over flooded the plate. And the egg was a soft boiled egg. Sigh. For $19. I am sorry I could have made this at home with actual real piece of steak on top and a golden sunny side up!!! Probably will never return for their food again."}
{"text":"Came here today with 3 hungry friends and unfortunately we were disappointed. This was mainly due to the cost of food versus the low quality of food. We started off with the charcuterie and cheese board. The bread was fantastic but the meat looked and tasted like low quality deli meat. We also had veggie tacos which filling resembled something from the frozen food aisle and was overcooked. The tempeh sandwich was bland and mostly tasted of garlic because of the chimmichurri. The tempeh itself was honestly just gross and the raw zucchini did nothing for the sandwich. The steak was tough as well. Overall the atmosphere was great but due to the poor quality of food paired with a high cost I will not return."}
{"text":"I ordered the slider, Caesar salad, and the Mac and cheese. Mediocre might be an overstatement.  I would class this under my save yourself list.  Dry Mac n cheese...i think it might have been last week's. Arugula in my salad with some clear garlic dressing not Caesar dressing. Clumpy.  And the littme slider was just okay.  Anyway; I would say save yourself the trip until they hire a chef.  Saturday  at 3pm... need a palate cleanser now."}
{"text":"Service was quick and friendly. Food was mediocre at best. Most entrees do not come with sides and the food is just boring."}
{"text":"Food was good what killed the experience was the long wait time to place the order, the place was under staffed and took us 45 mins to place the order. Food didn't take long to arrive, it was 25mins wait time after we placed the order which seems reasonable. This place needs staff to keep this place up and running good."}
{"text":"Fast service. Was not busy at 6:00pm on Friday. Had the brisket Mac n cheese which was delicious but small for $9. Also tried the calamari which was good but nothing special, the chipotle sauce was good. The fish taco was very unique, different from most, very fresh tasting. The apple maple pork belly was also a nice appetiser, again quite unique flavours that blended well.   My favourite was the brisket Mac n cheese. Overall a bit on the pricey side, but good for special nights out."}
{"text":"I ordered some finger foods and ordered couple of drinks with my friends. The food was descent, but portions were smaller than I expected. Service was great as they visited frequently to check on our status."}
{"text":"My friends were treated really badly here by the waitress.  The waitress slammed the receipt down and didn't even look at them when they were talking.  Don't come here."}
{"text":"My friend and I had nachos, edamame and a Caesar salad and all were disappointing. I would not recommend and will not be back."}
{"text":"My friend had advised me to try Taylor's Landing quite a while ago. We ordered drinks, our waitress did not ID any of us, although it was my 19th birthday, I showed her my ID anyway already having it out. I am from out of province, I do not own an Ontario ID or drivers license, or an Ontario health card and I was asked for a second piece of ID, I showed everything I had in my wallet to which she responded \"I really shouldn't serve you because you need an Ontario health card, but I will anyway.\" Our server was extremely slow and quite rude throughout the night, our drinks took a long time, our steak was very quick coming out and very tasty, our server checked on us a total of 4 times while we were there including bringing drinks and food, other people were bringing our food and drinks for us, and although we were sitting there, wallets out, no food or drinks on the table for at least 25 minutes, we still had to stop our server and ask to be brought the bills, she punched in one bill on the machine and left, and we were waiting another 5-10 minutes to continue paying with the machine. Overall the food was extremely good, our whole table enjoyed, service was very bad and extremely slow."}
{"text":"Come here for a college reunion. After reading the reviews I was worried, but ended up being pleasantly surprised. The ambiance aas bumping with the DJ playing gteat hip hop and r&b. Took us back to our college days. The food was just OK. I barely notice because the company was great. But then again, this is the kind of place you come more for the social than the food."}
{"text":"FOOD Overall, Meh because they don't seem to know how to season food or make it craveable.  I ordered one of each taco:  fish, beef, and pork.  $5 each.  I'm a big fan of authentic Mexican food and this is far from that.  Served on flour tortillas (not corn).  The fish was the best, but really it was the lesser of the three evils.  The shredded beef and pork were a bit bland and boring with mushy meat.  None were remotely spicy.  $6 Onion rings (battered, not breaded) were not good.  Very greasy.  I don't think they seasoned them with salt afterwards.  Was not a very large serving.  Desperately needed ketchup to make them somewhat enjoyable.  Food service was sloooooooow.  A bit offensive that they call their corn appetizer El Chapo Street Corn.  I'm not down with glorifying a drug king pin.  It's more fancy than your basic wings and burgers bar, but there isn't anything special about the menu.  I think they have an identity crisis.  I do love that they gave us each a tiny chocolate chip cookie wrapped in cellophane and sealed with a sticker with our check.  Nice touch.  Which is why I gave them 2 stars.  Not the best cookie, but obviously a housemade buttery cookie so they get credit for effort.  AMBIANCE Grafitti on their website homepage makes it seem like they're hip.  Shops at Don Mills website describes this as upscale dining.  Both give a false impression because it's really just a sterile looking dark bar.  Jeans or shorts will do just fine here.  There is a wall of glass door refrigerators for beer bottles, etc. so it looks like you're shopping at LCBO.  Open kitchen next to the refrigerators.  I glanced over at it and got death stares from the cooks.  Yikes!  TVs inside so you won't miss your sports, but didn't notice TVs outside.  I wouldn't entertain clients here.  I do like their patio, so I'll consider trying their brunch sometime.  Better for a date than for a night out with the guys or gals.  It's not really a belly-up-to-the-bar kinda place.  Definitely not a pub vibe.  ACCESSIBILITY It's a bit crowded, but it is pretty much a single level, large restaurant.  With a bit of assistance maneuvering around tables, a wheelchair or walker could do fine. There is a combination of high and low tables inside and on the patio.  A car can pull right up to the curb to let someone out.  The doors are large and very heavy, so assistance opening them might be necessary."}
{"text":"the service at this place is terrible, sat down for over 15min to get served. ordered a beer to start,  Canadian draught, most watered down beer ive ever drank in my life, didnt even bother trying the food after tasting that hideous beer. walked over to biermarkt..."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant on a Friday night. Got a seat for two immediately on their beautiful patio. Instead of getting mains, we got small plates to share including:   - Ricotta meatballs: One of the best dishes we tried! 3 meatballs in a yummy red homemade-tasting sauce.  - Mac & Cheese: Very basic, we found it to be on the bland side; however, we asked for Tabasco on the side for added flavour.   - Fish taco: Definitely recommend! Their tacos are on the larger side.  - Mezzie dip: Think 7-layer dip made of guac/tzatziki/pico de gallo. The chips & naan served alongside made for a good eat.   All in all, I'll be back to visit for sure. Food came out quick & server was very knowledgeable about the menu."}
{"text":"Incredibly underwhelming and overpriced for what you get. I got the bison bolognese and it pretty much tasted like spaghetti sauce out of a can with random arugula thrown on top. Very little cheese, very little flavour. Altogether that with a pop was nearly 30 bucks. Almost everyone in our party was underwhelmed. Do yourself a favour and just go to Joey's next door.  Less expensive and the food is actually good.  In particular, it's incredibly annoying that the menu has  burgers listed with NO SIDES. 14/15 bucks for a burger. Add another 4 bucks for some fries. Are you kidding me?  Waiting staff was lovely but as a restaurant, the food is DEEPLY underwhelming and incredibly overpriced."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday and it was nice to see that the staff were very attentive. Taking into consideration, the size of our party, the food also came at a good length of time. Our waitress was also quite knowledgeable which helped speed up the ordering process.   Onion Rings - Not your average onion rings.  These came to the table and they honestly looked like donuts. The rings were, surprisingly, not overly greasy considering the amount of batter.  The onions still had a nice crunch to them and were juicy.  If it weren't for the chopotle aioli dip though, it would've tasted a little bland.  4/5.  Fish Tacos - This was a lightly battered and deep fried basa fish, which was also a pretty decent size.  The best part about this taco was the jicama slaw which gave it that nice crunch.  A little on the bland side which could've been easily fixed with some hot sauce but I really didn't want to take the flavour from the slaw away.  5/5.   Beef Cheek Taco - Pretty average tasting beef taco.  3/5.  I gave a higher rating due to the service however if I were to just rate them on the food, it'd be a 3 star."}
{"text":"My new fav go to for dinner. Can't wait to hit their new patio. My son loves it too! DJ on certain nights, best fish tacos, mussels, burgers, fries & margaritas in North York @Shops at Don Mills. Céline wins the best waitress award. She remembered our names 2nd visit. Very impressed. Awesome service & great prices!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night at around 7pm. Sat us quickly even though we were a party of 6. Service was not so great. Our waiter didn't check up on us much and didn't inform our table that they ran out of sweet potato fries but still took the order. He did offer a free dessert though  at the okay of his manager which was nice.  Music was a tad loud as well.  Food is a bit pricey. I had the herb & citrus chicken club sandwich for $14 (came between a sliced croissant and no fries), one friend had 5 wings for $9. Side note, none of their entrees comes with sides. Drinks are decently priced. Had a pint of Rolling Rock for $6 or you can get a growler of Rolling Rock (which is their pitcher but it's 2L) for $27. Prices vary of course depending on the beer you get. Their sangria is pretty good too from what I've heard from my friends."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my steak & eggs brunch which came with a pretty perfectly medium-rare 4oz steak. Was less impressed with the chicken & waffles, which had an oddly sour taste to it (like vinegar).  Other than that, seating was comfortable and although reservations are available on Open Table through Taylor Landing's website, they turned out to be unnecessary for our Saturday brunch as there were plenty of open spaces.  Service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Despite my girlfriend telling our waitress that she was allergic to cilantro, she was served a salad which had cilantro in it. This had been written down, and she even successfully avoided bringing us tacos, which she told us had cilantro in them. To then make a crucial mistake and bring out something which could've potentially sent her to the hospital is inexcusable. I let it go at the time and simply took the discounted bill, but I shouldn't have stopped there.   The food here is ok at best. This is the kind of place you go to for late night drinks and apps. I have to say that the pricing of the beers here is highly questionable. Where else in the world are you going to find Coors Light and Creemore for the same price? It doesn't make any sense to me at all.  Very good image and a strong first impression when you walk in, but a mixture of mediocre service and food really takes away from the potential this place could offer."}
{"text":"The service is very good I ordered the calamari too much breading it was hard to find the calamari. I also had a fish taco that was ok .. But there was a piece of fish that was 1 w x 1 1/2 long and 1/4 high. I asked the server about this she apologized and said there is usually two pieces of fish on this dish. I would not rush back to eat maybe wine on the patio which is very nice."}
{"text":"A new brunch place at shops of Don Mills? Let's try it out! Taylor's landing replaced PF Chang's and offers an eclectic variety of items. I started with a $16 Landing Cure Caesar. Is it huge? Yes. Is there enough garnish to consider it a meal? Yes. Is the Caesar itself exceptional to warrant the hefty price tag? Meh. Moving on. The brisket Mac n cheese? Neat and tasty.  Fish tacos? Bigger than expected. Chicken and waffles? Moist and flavorful. Cheesecake French toast? Delicious. Service was great - the staff still seem very eager and enthusiastic. Though it's a bit heavy on the wallet, the food's different, good/great, and I don't need to trek all the way to hipstery downtown for the same quality of brunch."}
{"text":"This is near me, so I have eaten here several times since it opened and it has never been special but now has only gotten worse. Very basic pub food that at least used to be consistently decent. On my last visit they messed up the ubiquitous Caesar salad and fries! I tried to eat through it but finally had to say something. Mushy fries arriving after the burger was finished, and insanely salty salad. My waitress for fantastic, but the new assistant manager she sent over for my \"feedback\" then began to debate with me- waaay too much work. Even writing out here how many mistakes were made after that moment is too much drama for a place that doesn't merit it. And after all that, nothing was comped! Seriously? This place is a not an eating destination. It relies on locals to come back for basic but consistently decent food and service. Total fail. I had to ask again for another manager (who was excellent) to intervene and correct the new guy who was seemingly power tripping or not getting the market positioning of a local pub. Whatever. Too much work. Not going back. For almost half the price, I could have gotten hormone and antibiotic-free burgers, hot, crispy fries, and a surprisingly good salad and all fast,without attitude, at the South Street Burger one minute walk away. Going there next time for a quick bite, and going downtown for a real restaurant experience."}
{"text":"Location/Service - Right in Shops and Don Mills (near the centre main grassy area) - Plenty of parking available, within their multi-level parking garage as well  - Very large and spacious restaurant. Pub style furniture (comfy, cozy). Patio also available (which you can also bring your dog!) - Staff were overall nice and friendly. Orders were also quick as well  Food - Shared a few appetizers and two mains - Jerk Chicken taco (came in 3's) were good. Sauce complimented well, chicken was tender and not dry. Would be a little better if the taco was a bit more crispier  - Brisket Mac'n'Cheese. Brisket was easy to taste and not dry. Surprisingly fit well with the mac n cheese. But portion wise is really really small (see pic for reference) - Lobster Fettuccine. Good amount of lobster meat, but overall portion does seem small. The tarragon cream was nice to taste and fits well with the fettuccine. - Chicken pico de gallo pizza. Smoked chicken was good, didn't taste much of the spicy tomato sauce. But with the pineapple and pico de gallo, it matched well as a whole. Pizza was also thin crust, suitable for my tasting.  Overall, I think this is just an okay spot. Perhaps it's within Shops at Don Mills, but prices are on the pricier end - can't justify as much compared to the portion size. Food was generally okay, but didn't give me a wow or surprise factor. Sharing wise on the food was enough - would also recommend that as well."}
{"text":"Went there for Sunday brunch and was quite disappointed with the food.  The food was poor in terms of taste and texture, overall very uninspiring for the price and location of the restaurant.  The chicken waffle had both very dry chicken and waffles. The pulled pork burger (taylor's burger or something) had a beef patty with very little flavour.  The saving grace was a friendly wait staff and the salad that came with the burger was quite nice with a mix of cut fruits."}
{"text":"The ambience was nice but service was terrible.   I ordered the beer battered onion rings and turkey burger. The onion rings were too oily for my liking and the turkey burger was super dry.   The place wasn't that busy but it took our server over 15 minutes to come and take our order. He didn't come to check up on how our meal was, he only dropped off the check in the end. I don't think I'd come here again."}
{"text":"Just an upscale jack astors, in my opinion. The wait staff was all nice and friendly, but thats pretty much it. For appetizers, we got the mussels and mezze dip; mussels were okay, same with the mezze dip. Neither blew me away. For the entre we got the chicken club, and turkey burger. The chicken also was mediocre but the turkey burger was bad. Im pretty sure they undercooked it but I dont have the food poisoning to prove it. The tacos here are what set it apart from every other chain bar-grill; and it does make a difference. All their tacos are quite good, but you can deffinitely find better ones else where. Overall, just your typical bar/grill, with nothing spectacular to offer. Not worth the price, but just a place where you can get a drink and watch the game with tacos."}
{"text":"Small portions and kitchen service was slow. Front of house staff just mulled about as there was nothing they could do. Just refilling our water glasses and coffee mugs while we waited endlessly for the food."}
{"text":"Taylor's Landing is much like all the other \"Landing\" chain locations. Food is a nicer pub grub. They have a wide variety of drinks to choose from to pair with the food. They have a nice variety of seating and service is on point."}
{"text":"A pretty cool new restaurant at the Shops on Don Mills, but it does seem quite similar to a couple in the area.  The decor inside was quite nice, with more a rustic approach to the interior. The lighting was pretty sweet too, as it looked a little like stars on the ceiling.  The food here was pretty good, but I would highly recommend their starters. The Brisket Mac N' Cheese was amazing, and the presentation was quite unique. Looked more like a slice of cake! The Apple Maple Pork Belly was also great, cooked just right. For the entrees, my friend and I got the Bison Bolognese and the Slow-Hand Beef Shortrib. Both were quite good and a good sized portion.  Service was very good, as they were very nice. It got quite busy at one point and the main server wasn't around as much, but he did apologize whenever he came by.  Good overall, if I'm in the area, it's nice to know that there is another good choice!"}
{"text":"Four of us went for a birthday dinner & informed the waitstaff 3 times of the occasion. They forgot. And our special event went uncelebrated. Before going, some of us were hesitant to pick Taylor's Landing due to the less than stellar Yelp ratings (2.5/5). Most of the bad ratings, however, were due to the service. According to our experience, while the food was decent, the service was indeed terrible. We all ordered steak frite, and 2 of them had to be sent back for being rare, when we ordered medium well. It was a long wait for the extra cook time. We spent of the evening mostly waiting--for this and that. The staff were inattentive, seemingly going out of their way to steer clear, and 1 even made eye contact and deliberately looked the other way. When they finally brought the bill, they were suddenly all pushy and attentive, while we were talking. Other things to note: the music would alternate between non-existent & deafeningly loud. The mac&cheese appetizer is overrated. Steak was good (once the got the doneness right). Sticky toffee dessert was the best thing we ate. Side salad portion was chintzy. Decor was good. Washroom was dirty.   I would rate an overall of 2, but I'm going 2 points higher for one reason: Nathan, the Australian manager. He was great. He made up for the poor service with his charming wit and apology for our wait, and he comped our dessert. Well done, sir."}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars, but that isn't a possibility. My husband and I came to enjoy a night out, which we don't do often. Since we hadn't been here before, we decided to try out this spot.   I would love to be able to give a proper review of the food, except we weren't served anything. AT ALL. The hostess sat us on the patio, gave us menus, and that was the last interaction we had with any staff member for a while. We waited almost 15 minutes, and in that time we watched numerous busboys and servers whisk by us serving all the tables around us. EXCEPT for us. Nobody came by to bring us water, ask us for our order, or even introduce themselves.  About 5 minutes after we sat down, my husband overheard one of the waitresses behind me telling another waitress that she was responsible for our table, at which point she denied, then the both of them walked away. We waited another 5 minutes before I decided to stop one of the busboys and asked him if he knew where our server us. He walked over to the hostesses to check, and we watched them talk it over, one of the hostesses referred back to the seating plan and looked back over at us, puzzled. The busboy walked away and the hostess went about her business.  Shortly after that, a gentleman, who we assume was the manager, had served the table beside us and then approached the same waitress who denied that she was responsible for us, telling her our table was hers. She rolled her eyes, exasperated and stated loudly \"I GUESS\", and then walked in THE OTHER DIRECTION, still complaining.  At this point, we gave up and decided to take our business elsewhere. At no point is this acceptable to any customer. We would have stayed and gave them a chance, had we not witnessed the numerous times our table got denied service. It was not only unprofessional of that specific waitress to act in that manner in front of customers, it was extremely rude and disrespectful.  We were really looking forward to dining here, especially for a special occasion that doesn't come around too often, so it was highly disappointing that our evening started off that way. To the Taylor's Landing management, you may want to re-educate your staff about proper customer service.  That wasn't a good look for you, and  because of this experience, it's very likely we won't be returning."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I really really did.  Ended up here because I'm tired of Joeys. First, their booths are not made for 4. I waa told sit where I want when I said the table was cramped and a girl that worked there tried to tell me I couldn't sit there but the restaurant was pretty slow... I sat there anyway lol  Drink order was good, virgin ceaser and a heineken. Apps were ok, calamari looked meh but the dip was good. Mac and cheese was on point. The onion rings were underwhelming.  Main, I got the tempeh sandwich. I didnt like it at all. Ceasar salad was very roughly chopped and way too much sauce.  Dessert was toffee sponge cake... So though it tasted good, if youbput that much caramel on anything its gonna pass for a decent dessert lol.  Sorry, probqbly won't go back. Such a shame."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre and not worth the price. The seasoned beef on the nachos was super salty. Brisket Mac and cheese didn't look appealing and tasted gamey. Not once did our server or a manager ask how we were enjoying our food."}
{"text":"I spent Super Bowl Sunday at TL with 2 friends.  All of us decided on trying the $25 pork roast dinner that was prepared on the outdoor patio; the pig was drunk after being injected with Jack Daniels.  Enjoyed the meal along with $11 Coors Light 30 oz drafts.  The place was only about 20% full but we had a great time...with bartender Abby and (crying) Patriots fans!  Didn't win the football pool...but EAGLES RULE!"}
{"text":"Temp of restaurant was cold even the staff were complaining.  Waiting over 25 minutes for a budget and fish tacos with three other tables in the whole place.  The fish tacos were a 2-10 dry and tasteless.  Burger was a 5/10. Serving staff were friendly."}
{"text":"Honestly..................... Food is bland. Seriously off. I'm sitting here right now disappointed."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch with a large work group.  I would say I give it 3.5 stars.  I had the reservation for awhile but still seemed like we overwhelmed them.  The wait was about an hour from order to delivery.  Kind of too long in my books.  The food was pretty good.  I had the chicken (maybe a tad too salty). Everyone else's food looked delicious though.  Just work on faster service.  The ambiance was great.  Would come back to try some drinks."}
{"text":"Dropped by here in hopes that the Shops at Don Mills had another good food establishment opening up...boy was I both angry and disappointed. I should make it clear that I did drop by thier soft opening so I guess thier staff was kind of still working out the kinks but honestly it was one thing built on another that led to a total wreck. So let's start with the food.  El Chapo Street Corn: This dish is unbelievably salty, and the corn they use can no way be fresh as it honestly was more bland than sweet. The seasoning that they use is sodium overkill and I pretty much just brushed all the seasoning off. Mind you I have quite a savory pallette so this was quite a shock  Steamed Edamame: Not really too sure how you can screw up pre-cooked soybeans but this restaurant honestly figured it out. Overcooked and again extremely salty, if you order this dish either avoid it or add the lime to cut down some of that insane sodium.  Brisket MacNCheese: Not really a memorable dish at all, the MacNCheese, and the brisket was bland. I think they just sauced it up to try and save the dish.  Beef Slider: this dish was actually good..but at $5/pc for one mini sampler size burger...it was a bit expensive   Apple Maple Pork Belly: this dish honestly was quite gross, it was like they boiled the pork belly in the fat and smothered maple syrup on it. Extremely greasy and actually just gross  Cheeky Poutine: Soggy fries, bland cheese curds, again extremely salty gravy   Crispy Calamari: The Calamari itself was fine, the pickled red chili was useless to the dish and the chimchurri aioli was again very salty. I skipped the Aioli and just served with lime. Portions are a joke for this dish  Beer Battered Onion Rings: good crust....but again SALTY SALTY SALTY  Manhattan Cut Steak: ....simple don't order this dish  Spaghetti Carbonara: This dish was edible although way too creamy almost like it was an Alfredo sauce instead. The bacon in this dish was extremely chewy, the chicken was dry but hey at least they managed to cook the pasta al dente .  Bison Bolognese: all I remember was this dish was bland... unfortunately not memorable so I can't really recall all the flavors from my pallettes being destroyed from a that salt  Service: Now you're wondering...if the food didn't taste good why didn't I complain...well the thing is I would complain except service was so dodgey after placing our orders that no one really dropped by our table. Water didn't arrive till we reminded our server that she forgot it when our food was already coming out. I saw some people running food to our table including possibly 2 of the managers one female and one male...but it's ok there's empty dishes on our table and our drinks are empty but since you are the manager you don't need to attend your guest...or check on them. Maybe because we are asian? I don't know...but I am paying for the meal and I am trying my best to impress my guest with your beautiful restaurant but unfortunately you left them all with a rotting impression. Server did check up on us...but checking up on us every 2mins was a bit excessive espcially if you do it 10x in a row. However after she checked up on us she had clearly abandoned us after the barrage of check ups as she had forgotten my replacement plate, then forgot my utensil, then forgot my salt that I needed for my extremely bland steak, then forgot to clear dishes or refill my drinks. The manager did pass by and took a glance at our table....but clearly they are above all to help thier team clean up a bit. Our BLONDE waitress was quite clueless, fortunately I'll leave her name out and let management do some sort of work at least. By the way...usually when a manager comes to your table ESPCIALLY if your soft opening, possibly trying to make a good impression of the face of your restaurant, and your guest happens to order quite an assortment of food you should maybe ask how the whole experience was instead of BADGERING RUDELY SEVERAL QUESTIONS about the payment option of the guest? Again...do we really need another #StopRacialProfiling incident like what the Toronto location CactusClub just suffered? Not a single smile nor a single greeting from the manager when he came to our table. As I said maybe because we're Asian? I don't know? I wanted to complain about the food, but clearly the management didn't care about the guest experience so I didn't want to waste my time. I paid the bill, I left a generous tip (ask your waitress), you guys just left a very bad experience to some very nice guest I had. I took a gamble by trying your restaurant and unfortunately you took more then my money, you also stripped away my guest and I's respect.  Will I Repeat? Maybe if I wanted to take pictures of the inside of the restaurant...but dining in...after the sodium overkill and the racial profiling from the manager leaving my guest and I upset?   NO WAY AT ALL!!!"}
{"text":"2 star for our server. 4 star for ambiance,food and choice of beer. So the staff is what screws this place up.   Honestly- if this place wants to survive in an already over-saturated market of high end pub fare (joeys is right across them) they got to have some more cheerful people working in there. We were a table of 10- and the hostess was nice enough to let us know that there is 18% auto-gratuity. So cool. Guessing that we are going to get the royal treatment. We literally had to ask other servers, \"can our waitress please speak to us?\" - multiple times!  Our server- who was also the bartender was just not in the right mind. She would come running towards our table like a raging bull. \"What would you like?\" ...Rushing thru the questions we have about the menu. Taken we are a group of guys and maybe she didn't like that atmosphere. I don't know- she made us all feel beneath. Like we were not cut out to dine at Taylor's landing or are not the demographic crowd that is invited there. Maybe establishments should stop allowing bartenders serve tables as she was miserable. The energy carried on to the table.  We get a nice table in the corner enough to accommodate all of us and lots of TV screens. The hostess brought our menu and drink menu for 10 people. If she didnt- I don't know who would have. The drinks were amazing. Lot of choices for beer lovers like me- I even got touristy and walked up to their beer fridge to see their selection. I was told i am not allowed because it was close to the kitchen area which is understandable- so my bad! The growlers (their version of a pitcher) are little bit on the pricey side. However if you go pint for pint- it is the best way.  The Thai mussels were amazing. At $5 a pop- the sliders are steep. However- really really tasty. The mac and cheese is very popular and it was decent. I also tried the Mac N Cheese Brisket - which had a bbq pulled meat on top of the mac and cheese. Good as well. The taco's were weak. I would avoid them for sure. Their fries were solid as well.  It was my buddy's b-day and even he got a bad vibe from the server. We decided to take our money and go across the street to Joey's. It was impossible to get the server's attention as she didn't glance our direction. We finally flagged the manager. Who was really polite and professional and patient. He apologized and spent some time with us to let us know more about the restaurant. I wanted to like this place. I love hunters landing. I want this location to do well as it is closer by. However- they have got to get nicer people bringing us our meals."}
{"text":"My friends and i on a friday night, went to shops at don mills, & originally planned to go to joeys which was an hour & a half wait .. so we went here which was like a half hour wait instead.   Ill get to the okay stuff after, because I cannot get over how shit my food was . There is only 1 steak on the menu , for like $24 , so i shouldve already gotten the hint..  but seriously, order ANYTHING from that menu,  DO NOT ORDER THE MANHATTAN CUT STEAK!  It was the most piece of shit piece of meat ive ever had as a steak..  & my friend had ordered it too, hers was 'medium' mine was medium well..  both DRY as hell, like full out had to wrestle with it with my knife.. and tasted like stew beef.  Omg. No.    Aside from THAT nonesense   The calamari was great .   Im sure it has other good foood, id be back to try it .  But like, take that disgrace off ur menu."}
{"text":"Most discusting food i have ever had. The steak was over cooked and the fries tasted weird. There is a hair in the water and the manager said we got u a new glass of water and is there anything else........ Will never come to this restaurant ever again!!!"}
{"text":"Everything was over cooked except the calamari  We offered a Mama margarita pizza, burger and grilled chicken  They were all over cooked even the chicken was for my 2 year old from the kids menu!!!  I wouldn't come back here again even if they pay me to come"}
{"text":"The foods are pretty nice and good portion. However, the drink (maybe just the one I ordered) is too over priced + too much ice! For a $12 cocktail, I expect the quanity to be a little bit more!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the bar staff were friendly and food is pretty good. We always sit at the bar. The last 2 times I was there not so great. We had to leave because the music was too loud to carry on a conversation and the worst part was the exceptionally rude door man. He has 1 job to open the ultra heavy door. He failed. Both on the way in and out. He says \"you have to push it really hard bc it's so heavy\" It was really cold that night..I guess he didn't want his little hands to get cold. I really wish I had gotten his name bc he was extremely rude when I mentioned it was his job to hold the door no??"}
{"text":"I walked into this restaurant with medium-high expectations and was disappointed. We went at an odd mid afternoon time thinking it'd be empty but there were quite a few tables occupied. We were greeted and given a table immediately. The decor was lovely. So unique and homey and comfortable.  We walked in knowing that we wanted to order tacos, we love tacos. Our server was nice and our food didn't take long to arrive. It took us awhile to get refills on our waters and to get our bill but we were then informed later that there was only one waitress working all the tables!   Corn appetizer: not amazed. Now I'm comparing to roasted corn from another restaurant at this point and it was a major disappointment. First off, this order comes with 2 - three inch corn on the cob. It was only coated at the top with seasonings and was it feta cheese? Or some sort of cheese that reminded me of eating a Greek salad. There was no buttery flavouring to this at all and I personally feel that corn should. It also seemed like it was boiled and then thrown on the grill for some char marking. Um....I've had better. Much, much better.  Fish taco: hit or miss. Both my guest and I ordered the same taco and mine was loaded with vegetables with the smallest piece of fish. Hers had a good balance of veggies and fish. The flavours of the fish itself was pretty good though. I was thrown off by the  crunchy, melted cheese as the first topping on my tortilla. Pork taco: I had a good balance of meat and veggie ratio with this one. The meat was nicely flavoured as well. I just thought the pineapple was too sour and the large dollop of cold sour cream ruined the taco. Maybe ask for it on the side so you can dress your taco yourself?   The price for these items were decent though although I've had bigger, better tacos in other joints around the city.  Perhaps we'll have to try their other items to make a full judgement but for now, we'll have to stick to going elsewhere for tacos - sorry!"}
{"text":"Probably won't be back again.   The food was decent but not worth what was being charged. To give you an idea: I ordered the beef sliders appetizer (which came out AFTER my meal, by the way) to realize it was just a single beef slider. I paid $5 for 1/5 of a burger. What restaurant serves SINGLE beef sliders?!   To top off it off, my salad was the smallest meal-sized salad I've ever seen in my life.   I get it, some restaurants over-charge for the ambiance and experience but even the service was extremely sub-par even on a busy Friday night.  The only \"pro\" to my experience: knowing not to go back."}
{"text":"I'll be back.  Pretty good menu.  Not a lot on the menu...but whats there is good.  Tacos, onion rings, calamari"}
{"text":"Honestly the service was the only good thing here. Super knowledgeable and kind. I don't remember her name but she was short lol  The macaroni app I had with my beer was OK.. But so small in portion that it was a complete rip.   Atmosphere is fine, just another Landing bar and grill place trying to be more upscale than it is.   It's more of a 2.5 star rating. The experience overall is just as enjoyable as the last Landing place."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Taylor's Landing after a movie at the VIP theatres at the Shops of Don Mills. I was not impressed. I had only ordered a dessert, but it was gross and not at all like a typical crisp. It got sent back and I ended up not eating anything because the dessert menu was very limited.   My friend had a Caesar salad and the Mac and cheese with brisket on top. I tried a bit of the Mac and cheese and was also not impressed. The Mac and cheese itself had no flavour, which probably explains why the brisket is on top.   It was my first time at Taylor's Landing and it'll likely be my last. The only good thing I'll say is that the servers were incredibly nice and helpful."}
{"text":"3.5.  Good service they were able to cater to my food needs.  happy to see some gluten free items on the menu.  the decor and the atnosphere and environement is a great open concept.   the reason why i gave a 3 review is because the i feel like for the portion of food in comparison to the price i dont see the value.  the food was good dont get ne wrong.  but ive been to high ends restaurants and its not about the money spent its about portion value which unfortunately i did not find at taylor and landing.   i would only come back for drinks with friends and maybe a share plate or dessert.  good experience here though."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place zero stars but have to put something down. My friend and I just left. Upon arrival we were promptly seated. However, that was it in terms of speedy-ness. We waited 10-15 min the be served while watching all the other tables around us get served multiple times. Mind you, it was not busy and small number of patrons there were seated on the patio all around us. No one else came to check in with us, ask if we wanted water etc. After waiting that long, we left, never to return."}
{"text":"Our food was ok, not bad, not good. We called here while we were waiting for a patio table at Jack Astors (a few steps away), because their patio is way nicer at Taylor's Landing. 3 moms, 3 strollers, knowing that not everyone cam accommodate. They said yes no problem. Ended up seating us beside a bunch of drunk, swearing men who broke a glass that hit me and missed my baby. This was at 1pm. Everyone there was staring and obviously as appalled as we were. Our server apologized and told us that they actually had the tables reserved so they were there first, not sure what that was supposed to do other than make us more angry. We paid our bill and left.   I emailed them later to let them know in future not to seat people with infants close to rowdy crowds. They did not answer for two days, I forwarded my email to group sales and they answered saying that \"World cup is very emotional for some people\"......ok. Lol. Safe to say we will not go back and strongly recommend you not take any young ones (especially during the world cup, or I guess any emotional sporting events, like an elimination hockey game perhaps ;)"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's really nothing special. The ambiance and patio is nice but the food was okay. I ordered the honey smash cocktail which was probably the best part. It was very fresh and tasted more like a smoothie to me. To eat, I started with the trio dip and then ate the Taylor's Landing salad. Food was good but nothing I haven't tasted before."}
{"text":"I've been to William's and Hunter's Landing so it was about time I tried Taylor's. Anyways, it was really pretty inside. Modern decor with a dim lighting and a homey feel to it. It's also conveniently located at Shops at Don Mills.   When we came in the hostess didn't greet us but our waitress was nice enough. We were seated right away and our food arrived pretty fast. I got the Righteous Greens which I have to say was quite delicious...HOWEVER, the portion sizes at this restaurant are SMALL! After I ate I felt like I literally had a snack. My boyfriend got the Landing Burger with fries which he said was pretty good but the burger itself lacked a lot of the basic toppings (mustard, relish, lettuce) you'd expect to find in a burger.   I also had a problem with the sparkling water. I'm an avid Perrier drinker since I cut out pop almost 10 years ago so I was expecting something cold and bubbly, like what I'm used to. However, this sparking water (which I think they make themselves  as it came in a glass water bottle with the restaurant's logo in it) was warm and seemed to be pretty flat. I definitely wouldn't get this again.  Lastly, I really like that the server sends you off with a chocolate chip cookie ! :)  Overall, I liked the food but probably wouldn't come here if I were starving and I definitely wouldn't order the sparkling water again."}
{"text":"Located at PF Changs previous location ar Shops at Donmills. Service wasn't good. Food wasn't memorable. Definitely better pubs around the Shops."}
{"text":"My second time at Taylor's landing. I first came here when it just opened!!! The place is more packed for sure but that's the only thing that has changed for better! Ordered oysters and fish taco. The oysters were ok but the fish taco was cold and not even close to being ok!  Friends ordered calamari which was cold and stale not crispy at all!  Mezze Dip with nachos was made with one spoon of guacamole, tasteless! Apparently the steak was half decent according to my friend!  The burger is a disaster!!! Seriously worse burger ever, the bread was burned(look at pic)!!!!!!!!  It's February -10 outside, let me put it this way it was -3 inside!!!  Interestingly they run out of wine glasses so the white wine was served in scotch glasses!!!! Some say third time is the charm but I honestly don't see myself coming back anymore!!! This place is a waste of time and money!!!  The service is poor, you are left on your own for long time!!!! If I were you I would go to other places close by, at least you will get a decent food!"}
{"text":"I recently visited the shops of don mills location and wasn't very impressed with the quality of the food. The nacho's was just a bunch of cheese melted on the nachos and chicken dumped in the middle, no veggies and the cheese tasted horrible. The menu said it was loaded or had all the fixins but that was clearly not the case, it was also 20 dollars. The beet salad I ordered was better but there was too much dressing. Even though our waitress was a gem and we appreciated her service, I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Typical terrible Cara Operations restaurant.  Menu selection is terrible and what arrives at the table is mediocre food.  Do yourself a favour and don't go."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with two other friends.  We made a reservation beforehand and got seated on the patio right away.  Great patio.  Tables are either bar height or regular, i prefer regular.  Our group shared the beef poutine and fried calamari. Both were really good!  I had the chicken sandwich on a croissant and both my friends opted for the turkey burger.  Sides are extra so we decided to share some sweet potato fries and an order of onion rings.   My chicken sandwich was delicious.  Friends also enjoyed the turkey burger and said they would order it again.  We also shared an order of sticky toffee pudding which was also yummy.  Definitely quite impressed with Taylors Landing and will return again soon."}
{"text":"Food is bland, portions are tiny and it is unacceptably expensive.    Service was good though but the booths were very upright and uncomfortable. Not sure I would return.  Joeys or BeerMarkt across the street are far better"}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new place other than Joey's at Shops on Don Mills so we gave Taylor's Landing a try. The staff was very nice and friendly and we were given a table after a few minutes even though it was a busy Friday night. We ordered the Burger, the Tempeh Sandwich and the fish taco. I wasn't very impressed with the tempeh sandwich. I don't know whether they don't know what chimichurri is or there was a mistake in the kitchen but my sandwich had pesto instead of chimichurri. That I didn't really mind but still the sandwich wasn't anything memorable and was very bland. The taco was ok and burger looked ok (I didn't try it).   I found the food and drinks to be way over-priced. They charge $13 for a mediocre sandwich and additional $4-5 for any sides such as fries. I had a glass of red wine which costed $13 for 5oz but it looked more like 3oz to me.   Overall I wasn't really impressed by Taylor's Landing even though I had very high hopes for it. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back.   Food: 3.5/5 Atmosphere: 4/5 Prices: 3/5 Overall: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Excellent menu, staff, atmosphere. Not overpriced like some places in the shops. All was well except for one minor thing - while waiting for our patio table, we got the alert that our table was ready - when we went to be seated the hostess said \"sorry looks like someone took your seat!\" So basically we sat at the bar all night, not a huge deal but something that should not regularly occur"}
{"text":"Food was tasty but arrived cold. Cold poached eggs are the worst. Table service was good. Food service was slow. Kitchen clearly has a problem. The place was almost empty at 11.30 AM for brunch and kitchen was slow and produced 4 meals cold. When I asked a waitress for black pepper she arrived back when I had finished my meal. Coffee was ok. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Taylor's Landing is a newly opened restaurant that opened its doors in June 2016.  Affiliated with Hunters and Williams Landing in downtown Toronto, Taylor's is located uptown at Shops Don Mills. The ambiance (clean) is definitely a busy one with it's packed booths, tables, bar counters of patrons watching the games on the tele. If you're looking for a quiet dinner, refrain from coming here lol. Our server server was lovely, always attentive and efficient to ensure we were okay. For food we ordered their shareable apps; *Beef brisket Mac and cheese 5/5 packed with flavor, decadent cheese complimented the sweet savory brisket, truly enjoyable. *calamari, 3/5, well presentable, however too much batter but there's room for improvement. *meatballs, 4/5, served with a in-house tomato sauce, not acidic, meatballs were simple yet hearty. Overall food was okay, the prices are moderate, for the area."}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend. 2/5  I was with a group of 7 who went for dinner and drinks after work on a Monday at Taylor's Landing. The patio was full but there were plenty of tables inside so we were seated right away, which was great.   Ambiance/location: Shops at Don Mills, so lots of great shopping nearby, and even a VIP Cineplex... great for date night! The restaurant is right across Joey's and Bier Market.   The restaurant is clean and spacious. Some of the chairs are great for esthetic but very uncomfortable to sit in.  Service: Our server was not attentive, and we had to continuously wave her down to ask if we can order drinks, order food, get another set of utensils,  ask for the bill, etc.   Food: We all ordered different things off of the menu and all concluded that we would not order the same things again.  Price: Overpriced for the portion size and quality of food.  Wish I had a better experience."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks at around 8:30pm.  We were quickly seated as the venue was not that busy on a hump day. Our server then disappeared and never came back to take our order. Another person had to help serve us water and got another waitress to serve our table of four.  Nachos were average, nothing special.  The guac came brownish colour when served. Meh.  Creem of Dublin was nice. Worth a try!  Free cookies for each person when the bill came. What a nice bonus. :)"}
{"text":"Came here for some late night small bites.  This is the old PF Chang's place in the Shops at Don Mills plaza.  The decor and ambiance of the place is really nice - lots of seating, tvs to watch sports, concerts (we were watching the Tragically Hip).  There is also a nice outside patio.  It was such a promising beginning...and then...  Since we had already eaten my friend and I decided to just get 2 apps and some drinks.  I will say the app prices are pretty cheap - most under $8.  We got the beef cheek poutine and the beef brisket mac and cheese.  The poutine lacked any kind of flavour and salt. Bland til the cows come home.  I thought the beef would give it a nice hearty taste...but nope.  Taste..oh where for art thou?   It was so flavourless that we didn't even finish it.   The mac and cheese was marginally better...the parts where the brisket wasn't burnt.  I though the brisket might have been mixed in with the pasta but it it was on top of the mac/cheese like a burnt cover.   Service was friendly but a bit slow but they were busy and this is a fairly newer place so i'm sure still working out some kinks.  I would come here for drinks but I don't think I would order any food here.  Unless I bring my own salt and hot sauce.  Maybe that's when I'll find some flavour flav."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, and for me the food has hit the mark each time. I've had the jerk chicken tacos and loved them - great flavouring. Although one of my dining companions had them and she didn't love them (not flavourful enough). I've also had the turkey burger and would recommend that too.   The service on the other hand had been hit and miss. If they could get that right each time, they'd get 4 stars!"}
{"text":"I enjoy eating at Shoppes at Don Mills, parking is easy, get to do some shopping before or after meal...it's great. We arrived before our reservations at 6pm and requested seating in the patio - they were able to accommodate us. The service was good at the beginning. Our server came over frequently without coming across annoyed because we took our time with drinks menu. She checked on us periodically. They were also super accommodating when 2 more people came to join halfway thru the meal.  I do agree with other yelp'ers on here that it took a while for them to clear the plates. Some items are a bit overpriced. Nachos for $19? There were nothing super special in it.  Maple glazed pork belly wasn't bad but ours were slightly burnt on the edges so it came out like fatty Chinese BBQ pork.  One more thing with regards to washrooms. For a slightly higher end resto, I expect a wastebasket for those who like to use a piece of paper to open the door because god knows not everyone wash their hands after using the washroom."}
{"text":"Perfect mom spot.   Everything about this place scream \"I'm wild\" but I feel safe! I don't feel like I will be attack here.   Food fine. It no taste special."}
{"text":"Horrible service and restaurant . My daughter and her friends were treated horribly from Tasha T . From the moment they came to the restaurant . took forever for food and drinks drinks warm food cold . didnt refill even when asked or condiments , gave dirty looks and then took food before they were finished and when they paid the bill and didnt leave a tip she threw the receipts at them . Horrible dont waste your time or money"}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch on Friday, got seated close to the patio. This is another cool place at Shops, offering food and drinks. Ordered tacos. They have beef, pork and fish, so I did the obvious thing and ordered one of each. ($5 per taco).  I'm a big fan of fish tacos so I tried it first. It was quite good, lots of fresh ingredients, fish was seasoned well. Next was the pork which I thought could have been better. Not as good as the fish. The beef taco was pretty nice, came with some cheese which created an interesting balance. I liked how all the tacos came dressed completely differently. If I had to rank them: fish, beef and then pork."}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I tried this place out and it was kinda disappointing. Everything we ordered was pretty tasteless.  Jerk chicken poutine was soggy and the fries tasted like they could have been cooked longer. For $10 it really wasn't worth it. Didn't even taste like jerk.  Chicken curry was a very sorry excuse for any kind of curry. It had that curry spice to it but almost no flavour at all but it is a Canadian restaurant so maybe that's what their take on it is.  Soup of the day was purée cauliflower and you really get puréed cauliflower...that's very bland and realy looks like baby food. It was the most disappointing because it looked so...like what we imagine prison food to look like.  The naan wrap/burger was also not that great either...  We thought Taylor's Landing would be better than this but we were wrong. We probably should have stuck with getting something more generic like the mac and cheese and nachos since you never go wrong with that.    We were seated at a high patio table which was very wobbly and we worried about our drink spilling over and it was overall annoying to have an uneven table.  One server cleared our table of our empty appetizer plates and took my cutlery and said he would come back with a new set for me. He never came back.   We won't come here again. It's a little bit pricier than normal and for what they serve, it's really not worth it. If you pay using the debit machine, it has a \"would you recommend us\" part before you pay and It's sad to say I have to tap \"no\".   If you want a patio and good food your best bet is bier market, joeys and jack Astros in the mall."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night for a surprise party, place was packed, but they were so great to accommodate us on a very short notice. The waitress was nice enough to let us know that we'd be paying the 18% gratuity beforehand so there's no surprises later.  The ambience is great. Our waiter was super nice, and answered all our questions and helped us pick out the drinks. Food wise, not many choices to choose from. The salmon was probably the best thing out of everything that was chosen. Portion were mediocre but by price not bad. The sandwiches came dry and stale. The fries were pretty good too."}
{"text":"Interior decor and patio are very nice. Food is okay. Most of their entrees don't come with a side and no garnish on their food and drinks - very plain looking. Service was so so. We ordered drinks but we had to remind our server of the order after a 20min wait.   We ordered most of the dishes that the server recommended. Fish taco was really delicious. Pork and beef tacos were not as good as the fish. Mac and cheese with brisket was a little too creamy, we could only taste the cheese. Calamari was very greasy. Landing salad was fresh and tasty. Meatballs were standard, nothing spectacular. Fries were highly recommended by our server, tasted almost like New York fries. For entrees, got the spaghetti carbonara, which was highly recommended by our server. It was served with a poached egg. It felt like I could have made it at home. It was very heavy and it got very salty near the end. We also got the Korean steak-cheese sandwich, it was delicious but definitely not very Korean-like. Costed about $110 for all these dishes with a pop and a virgin Caesar.   We would come back to give a second try but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Food was ok. We had the big wings, mezze dip, brisket mac and cheese and the Korean steak sandwich. I would say stay away from the mezze  dip it's a mix of guacamole, taziki, hummus all mixed together yuck! The mac and cheese was good not amazing and very small portion. The sandwich was probably the best of the bunch. I would probably come back for drinks. Patio was nice!"}
{"text":"Slow and absent service. It took 35 minutes to get our drinks after being seated and reminding three servers. Food was okay but nothing to write home about - all three tacos were good, the burger was overcooked, and our fries were inconsistent (some oil saturated and others what you'd expect). Other people in our section were annoyed at the slow service and had to walk inside to pay their bills.   Given their menu has a similar offer to Joey's, they're not doing much to impress.   If you have a few hours to burn, this may be the place for you. Otherwise, I suggest going to the Joey's across the street for better service and food."}
{"text":"Came here a few months ago. Decent food, comfy seating and attentive waitress/waiters. The food took a long time to come but overall the food tasted fine. Nothing was very impressive. Price wise it wasn't too expensive. Similar pricing like Jack Astor's and Milestones. Honestly we came here because it was new, bur nothing was worth while to come back."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch one Sunday morning. Great patio and location with spacious seating; however, the food was overpriced and not very good. The brunch menu was quite standard, but cost too much for what it was worth. Our server was not very attentive and it took us a while to order and also get our bills at the end of our meal. Not terrible but won't be going out of my way to come here again in the near future."}
{"text":"We were scared of the rating on Yelp but with Joeys at 2 hour wait and Jack Astors at an hour and 2 hungry 5 year olds, we had no choice on a Friday night. Have to say, outside of the burger, food wasn't bad at all. Definitely not 2 star level. The scallops and pork bellies were fantastic so were the wings. Fish tacos were good as well. Of our group of 10 unfortunately only my food (the burger) was bad. I would go back... getting wings and scallops next time."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to head to Shops of Don Mills for dinner.  We noticed a new restaurant, so we said let's give it a try.  We were warmly greeted and was ecsorted to our table.  The restaurant wasn't full so it was a bit strange that we passed a bunch of empty tables for her to bring us to a hightop table.  She asked if it was okay and my husband said that we would prefer a lower table.  I piped in and asked for a booth but she brought us to a 4 seater table.  Fine ....ok.  We looked through the menu and were greeted by our server.  She asked if we had been here before and we replied no.  She explained the Share Plates idea and walked us through the rest of the menu.  She took our drink order and when that arrived she took our food order.  We order the Crispy Calamari and El Chapo Street Corn to start.  For our entrees we ordered the Manhattan Cut Steak, Brisket Mac n Cheese and one of each taco (Beef Cheek, Pork and Fish).  Nearly 30 minutes go by with no food.  Luckily the light fixtures, furniture design and music kept us interested in the place as we had a lot to talk about.  Our server stopped by to tell us she would check as to why the long wait.  As soon as she left, our entrees arrived.  But no sign of our appetizers.  A few minutes later the corn and calamari arrive and our table was full of plates.  A manager apologized as there was some sort of miscommunication as he explained and that he would comp our starters for the inconvenience.  With 5 dishes on our table we picked at all our plates.  Everything was seasoned well and tasted great.  But there were a couple issues.  I love corn so I really wanted to love this dish.  But the corn had a mushy texture like it was over done and the corn wasn't sweet.  This dish would probably be amazing when corn is in season, sweet, juicy and crisp.  Secondly I ordered my steak medium and it came out rare.  I let my server know, she acknowledged that it was not cooked enough and she quickly took it back to the kitchen to cook longer.  The same manager dropped off my dish.  But this time he wasn't as apologetic as he was with the appetizer mishap.  It was a drop and go situation.  Fine....ok.  We couldn't finish all our food so we packed it up.  We still wanted to try a dessert and we went with our servers recommendation of the Sticky Toffee Pudding.  This dessert was delicious.  It has a spicy kick because of the chili salted caramel sauce.  It's too sweet for just one person.  This is a must share dessert.  All in all...the food and service was great.  As this place just opened last weekend all is forgiven.  Give this place few weeks to run smoothly and this will be a great spot for dinner and drinks.  Can't wait to see what the patio has to offer as it opens in July.  3 stars for now Taylor's Landing.  See you soon."}
{"text":"This is just an ordinary Shops at Don Mills restaurant. I ordered the Tapas for lunch. It was the Brisket Mac & Cheese. It was really good & I know it's tapas but the serving size was very small. To be fair the server did give me a heads up on the size but the order was $9.50! Also had the beef slider...nothing to write home about but was decent nonetheless. I wouldn't go outta may way to eat here again but I wouldn't avoid as well. It's definitely a 3-star."}
{"text":"Was really hoping for a better patio restaurant in the Shops on Don Mills Plaza.  Their patio is not open until July 1st and this place is just another unauthentic douche restaurant in this shopping plaza.  I know that seems harsh but the loud music makes it impossible to chat with your friends and the chair spacing is so far apart.  This is a place you bring someone you just don't want to talk to.  The service was good and the servers are eager to please.  They all seem new and oddly suggested getting a main to share... Nice try.  Their mains are pasta and sandwiches which would be awkward af to share."}
{"text":"Very spacious seating and good atmosphere. The food was decent, but nothing spectacular. I can imagine the noise level being really loud if the place was packed though, but I was able to have good conversation at the time I went. I am not a sweets kinda guy but the sticky toffee pudding was one of the most amazing desserts I've had.  Not dying to return, but I wouldn't mind coming back."}
{"text":"This was the worst dinning experience i have ever had. We walked in and sat at our table close to the doors waiting for our server. She came by and introduced herself and started off by saying she was new and that she would bring over crackers and veggies for my friends little one.  20 minutes later came by with crackers and then didnt even take our order. Our server was no where to be found. We had to flag down another waitress who took our order after waiting for 30 minutes. After the second waitress disappeared the manager had to be the server for our table.  We ordered curry mussels, chicken and waffles, jerk chicken poutine and a burger.  Curry mussels were very bland and rubbery. Chicken and waffles were so dry and hard as a rock that you could break one of the windows with it. Poutine was soggy with the gravy being so watery, it tasted like baby food. The burger was the only one that was half decent. It took over 40 minutes to get a drink.  We had to complain since the service was horrible and the food was tasteless. The manager was apologetic and took care of our bill. She asked that we make reservations next time and give them another try. We took their lobster pasta to go and it was not good at all. I will not be going back ever again. Definitely will wait to head over to joeys or the bier markt next time."}
{"text":"Great service, typical upscale bar food. You definitely don't come here for the food... more of the convenience and ambience. It's a great place with a good vibe. Great drinks and cool plates to share. The portions are great except for the salads. The nachos stand out as a bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Decided to dine here since there was a long wait at Joey. Was immediately seated in a comfy booth and served by friendly people. We ordered lightly since we were heading to a party shortly after, so we got the calamari, oysters, and the mac 'n cheese. Everything was pretty tasty, but a tad on the pricier side."}
{"text":"Service is great. Food is good. Super fun vibe. Good value. Ballet parking is a plus."}
{"text":"My fish taco had one sad sliver of fried dough instead of fish.    Place was great when it just opened, what happened???"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and ambiance - all very nice on a Saturday afternoon. But the food was quite mediocre.  I ordered a \"surf and turf\" special of the day. The steak was cut before it was set before me (what?) and the lobster tail was tiny. The steak was dry and flavorless. I had it packed to go and not sure why - it was worse the next day (then again, never reheat steak. Always consume it the day of).  Not worth the trek all the way to Shops of Don Mills for this. The area has turned into a playground for hipsters who now have kids. Children were everywhere - screams, shrieks and all."}
{"text":"Not bad as I thought it would be. Had the fish taco and brisket poutine...pretty good but missing a little something. Environment and decor is really nice and service was great =)"}
{"text":"I have come to this restaurant off and on since they opened and I kept forgetting to write a review. Had you asked me a year ago this place would've been a four star however now it gets a two.   I absolutely adore the atmosphere of this establishment. The decor, the giant doors its gives off a really good vibe and makes it inviting to those who haven't been in before. The service (and I think I have been extremely fortunate in this department) has always been WONDERFUL.  For instance, I was there last night with for my boyfriend's birthday and we had Krystal as our waitress. She was extremely accommodating from me being super picky and not wanting to sit where they placed us to what to recommending food to even entertaining our conversation! She was great and if I have to rate her service it would be 5/5 stars =)  Now on to the food, room temperature, flavourless and non appealing. First on a Monday they were sold out of the Manhattan Steak -- disappointment because that is the ONLY reason why we chose this restaurant because that is what the boyfriend was craving. So he ordered the Short Rib reluctantly. I have ordered the calamari to start, mussels and beef/fish tacos for my meal. The calamari seemed to be extremely bland. the mussels were not hot, it was like it was sitting there for a bit. The tacos were just meh, nothing wonderful about them what so ever.   So when we came here a  year ago the food was more flavourful and hot and something we craved and wanted to come back for. Now it will probably not be a spot I would plan to go to anymore. There is an Authur's Landing opening up in Newmarket (which is where I live) and I hope that it doesn't give the same disappointment as this one has given me.  Sorry I have to do an honest review, however your servers are WONDERFUL!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken and waffles for brunch. This was already my second time there, giving them a second chance. But I horribly regret it.  There were four tiny pieces of waffles, that were soggy and tasteless. Seriously if I put frozen egos I my oven at home, they will taste much better. The \"fried chicken\" that was on top of it were the size of my pinkie finger. They absolutely cheaped out on this one.  It was topped with a bacon mayonnaise sauce, which was the only thing that tasted fine.   Overall, I was very disappointed. As i have eaten at hunter's and Williams landing in the past, how could the quality differ by this much?"}
{"text":"Waste of money. Service was mediocre - saw many patrons looking around to get staffs attention. Asked if we could get the bill with the food, as we were trying to catch a movie - had to ask twice more, and still waited 5min before they came back with the machine.   And the food - was tasteless and ridiculously small portions. How do you manage to screw up eggs benny? Didn't even get the eggs right - actually was the opposite of what I asked for. Burned potato hash. No salt and pepper to the table and no one came to even refill the water.   Sticking with Joey's again next time.  Never going here again."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Taylor's Landing to check out the offering on Thursday August 25,2016. We really liked coming to P.F Changs and hoped the new boy on the block would be as enjoyable. Well, it seems that the menu here is really scant and has only bite size portions and quite pricey too. My wife got the Salmon on top of a bed of quinoa and a little offering of Brussels sprouts as the lonely vegetable. We were told next week maybe broccoli so the side was disappointing.  I had the burger and a Caesar (mini) that had little dressing on it for a total of $19.00. Very costly for a plain burger.  The seating was not too comfy by the wall. My wife could not rest her feet anywhere and the bar for feet was too low.  We agreed that we would prefer Joeys for the comparable meals, although the service was very good , it seemed to lack in what came out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"This was my second time around trying Taylors Landing. My first experience did not leave the best impression but I was invited back to give it another try. We figured that friday night reservations would be a nice date night for my boyfriend and I.   We started with the calamari. It came out surprisingly very quickly. It was quite good. Decent portion, nice and crispy and the aioli sauce that it came with was really tasty. For our mains we got the lobster fettuccine and the steak frites. The steak frites was cooked really well, juicy and came with a good portion of fries. I must say that they really do make delicious aioli sauces because the truffle aioli really made the fries! The only downside was that the steak was a bit salty. The lobster fettuccine was REALLY good! It was a generous portion of lobster and the pasta was rich/ creamy - the way fettuccine should be! To end off the night we got the sticky toffee pudding. It was a good portion - enough for both of us to share. The cake was dense and moist but we actually found it a bit salty. It was probably the chili salted caramel but we just found it a little bit strong for our liking. All in all it was a nice evening. The waitress and staff were very attentive and friendly! Its a nice place for dinner and will probably return for a night out with friends for drinks."}
{"text":"Many a times have I passed by this very trendy looking eatery at Shops at Don Mills.  My wife and I finally made it inside over the weekend, however the food was far from what we had expected.  The first thing we ordered was the Brisket Mac and Cheese for a starter, and their Turkey Burger for our mains.    Right from the get go I had sky high hopes as this meal combined two things I cherish most in my life (possibly more than my wife), cheese and beef!  When the meal arrived I was surprised to see the mac and cheese in bar form, and with only 3 very thin slices of overcooked brisket on it.  The brisket looked like those lazy breakfasts you make at home before work where you throw bacon on the pan, and forget about it while brushing your teeth and putting your tie on.  From a taste perspective... there was very little.  The mac and cheese paired very little flavour with an awfully wet and clumpy texture.  This was married to beef brisket which was sour and very dry.  On to the main course!  The Turkey burger looked rather appetizing, but upon enveloping a portion of it with my very hungry mouth it was very evident that it was extremely dry and overly salted.  I know that turkey burgers tend to be dryer than their bovine counterparts but this was excessive.  The salt content was overwhelming and rendered me unable to complete the burger.  On a more positive note the sweet potato fries were cooked well, but its rather hard to mess that up.  Not too sure if a repeat visit is in the cards  2/5"}
{"text":"Fairly nice place if you are looking for something new. Not extremely busy, but more high-end environment than other restaurants of its class. Can have a really good time here."}
{"text":"I haven't been back for quite awhile to Taylor's Landing and finally here for a revisit. Sadly the experience was totally different compared to before.  Saturday Night and our wait was less than 10 minutes for a table for 2 instead of 45 minutes across at Joey's. Maybe there's a reason?  Service was unorganized and our server was missing in action until we started complaining.  A mix up here and there with the service. We did finally get everything we needed and resolved.  Sausage Picante Pizza on super thin and crispy crust which I found it so so. My dinner mate ate all of that. Thanks for eating so no food was wasted!  It is kind of sad that they changed their menu to more generic offerings just like any franchise restaurants. Luckily the beer selections still decent if you want a craft beer."}
{"text":"you will not have a problem with parking. it's always something I have to consider when driving into Toronto. Taylor's Landing offers vallet on weekends and during the week you have parking near by or a massive parking lot. Public transportation near by as well. Bike stations too. Food was great. Thursday (tonight) Taylor's Landing on Don Mills Shops offers Wine bottles at 50% off. cocktails where ok, food and desert were good too, staff was friendly and professional. Prices should not be a surprise I mean you're in Toronto. so I wasn't surprised by their prices. You can book a table. with them in line. their menu is also online. I would go back."}
{"text":"New restaurant that replaced PF Chang. Ordered a bunch of appetizers so I can try a little bit of everything. The service was good and it's not too busy if you arrive around 6pm for dinner. Appetizers were good (see photos)"}
{"text":"For what it is (a pub/bar type place), it totally deserves 5 stars. Sat at the bar with my husband on a Saturday night. Lively yet not too loud. Great music.  Had a wonderful vodka-based cocktail with mint and muddled berries. I actually had 6, they were THAT delicious (over the course of 3 hours). Hubby had a Bloody Caesar.   We went the typical bar-fare route and ordered nachos, sliders, Mac n'cheese and onion rings. Could've done without the onion rings...but everything was fantastic.   The more \"culinary\" options looked fantastic, too.   Definitely going back.  Updated:***********  WOW, has this place ever gone DOWNHILL. Hubby and I go here every so often for a quick drink and snacks. The food and service have progressively taken a downturn, but last night deserves a special mention.  Sat at the bar and despite 4 (yes FOUR) bartenders milling about and passing us several times, we had to ask 10 minutes later if we could order.  Brutal.  Food was gross. Nachos - which used to rock - included guacamole that was for sure that nasty pre-packaged crap. Which, btw, is an extra $2.  Dirty plates were left in front of us for a good 20 minutes after we ate.  I felt bad leaving a 12-ish% tip - as a former server I never do this. But I'll never go back.  It's too bad. It started out strong."}
{"text":"This place is nicely decorated.  The woman  who sat us was nice.   Ok. Now that I've got the good things out of the way here goes.  Decor is lovely. None of the chairs are fat or 'big guy' people friendly. I'm fat. They weren't friendly. The booths were cool. The tables move.   One thing. The booth was full of crumbs. The one behind us was too. We came almost at opening so no one sat there before us. So..... um..... maybe you guys can clean?   They were also switching out dirty glasses on some while we were there.   Service.  I'm still waiting for her to bring me sugar and a spoon.  Oh and more coffee and water refill. Would have liked a Cesear but you never came back till it was bill time.  We did want dessert , thank you,  but didn't want to wait for you to not bring it either ( we had to ask for our meal after seeing two tables who ordered after us eating)   Oh it was practically empty to boot.  Food: I got chicken and waffles and my friend got something equally forgettable with a salad. Nothing special here."}
{"text":"It's a good place to grab a drink after shopping. Lots of parking by the grocery store and just walk inside the shops. I like the fish taco. The jerk taco is a little bit disappointing since I didn't taste the chicken meat inside, it's just full of lettuce, or maybe 2-3 pcs of jerk chicken ....lol . The staff were very friendly and nice."}
