{"text":"We split an order of the jalea. For those who don't speak spanish, \"jalea\" roughly translates to \"Awesome fried seafood orgy of sexy times\".  A mound of fried squid, shrimp, fish, served with fried yucca fries and topped with salsa criolla (a salad of pickled onions, tomatoes and chili). The batter was light and airy but plentiful around each nugget of seafood. Dipped in a little aji verde, the spicy sauce cuts through the batter while lending a creamy texture to each bite."}
{"text":"Great location, great service and fantastic food.  Chicken is off the hook and a must have!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  Owned and operated by Augusto Saravia (the son of Ricardo Saravia who runs Villa Wellington, a Peruvian restaurant just across the street) Augusto al Gusto serves up delicious mix of Latin American/Peruvian fare.  The menu is simple, with a variety of seafood, steaks, tamales, fajitas and their awesome braised chicken (the spice rub they use on the chicken is perfect) - though the real kicker is the gravy they serve alongside the chicken.  Obviously homemade, it tasted like liquified braised chicken skin, smooth and rich and almost more flavorful than the chicken itself!  Instead of the usual bread and butter to nibble on while waiting for order, they serve warm tortilla chips with an addictive, home made salsa, full of rich savory tomatoes, peppers, onions, cilantro and a generous splash of lime juice.  Though it may seem like a strange dish to serve at a Latin American/Peruvian restaurant, I think my favorite item on the menu would have to be the chicken milanese.  Portions are on the generous side, so come hungry or be prepared to take home a doggy bag.  Everything tastes fresh, the ceviche is among some of the best i've ever had and they also make a mean pisco sour.  The house wines, both the red and the white, are better than the average house wines and reasonably priced.  Service is fast and friendly.  As for dessert, the churros are nice, but I highly recommend the alfajores - a Peruvian \"cookie\" involving a layer of dulce de leche sandwiched between two shortbread cookies) if they haven't run out by the time you get there (it's a VERY popular item and they run out quite often).  It's a fairly small venue, with seating for about 50, though they do have some tables set up outside when the weather is nice, which adds another 20 or so seats.  High chairs are available and the staff has no problem accommodating families with small children."}
{"text":"I had a fish and chips plate- The fish was fresh, well done, the potatoes excellent  (they were perfectly brown- a good sign that they do not over use the oil like I saw in other places!). A symphony of tastes and flavours. My personal advice: in this resto do not use the ketchup- you change everything into a cheap meal! Ask for home made cookies with dulce de lecce! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Le poulet rôti avec salade et frite est excellent!!!  J'en commande presque toutes les semaines.  C'est moins cher qu'ailleurs et tellement succulent!"}
{"text":"Very good tasting... C'est un petit restaurant, les plats que nous avons commandé ont été délicieux et la portion était bonne aussi"}
{"text":"My brother and I both ordered the burritos and felt the same about them. The meal was small and everything seemed like processed food. It was very similar to a hungry man TV dinner. Pricing for what I got was far too expensive. Service was average."}
{"text":"Je suis désolée ma revue entière de Villa Wellington était pour ce resto. Le Ceviche a été plus que décevant : poisson pas vraiment frais portion ridicule... la seule raison pour laquelle je leur donne plus d'une étoile c'est qu'ils ont presque immédiatement offert de me rembourser. Pour plus de details voir mon eval de Villa Wellington qui en passant recevra sa propre critique aussitôt que j'en aurai le temps lol"}
{"text":"Went back here for a Sunday night dinner with friends. We were greeted quickly with water and our Sangria came right away. Food was awesome and everything was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Nice little Peruvian restaurant with good food.  I always get the fried shrimp with salad and potatoes.  They give you all kinds of yummy sauces too. Friendly people.  Definitely recommend going here!"}
{"text":"The service was very pleasant, we had a really good connection with the waitress and she was lovely at our attention. She took care of any details during the dinner and well explained cocktails, wines.  The food was not as much as the waitress..  I took a plate of tacos.  The food was good but I preferred the next Peruvian (Villa Wellington) hold by the same person. For the rest of my dinner I experienced their Churros. That's the thing which must be tried !!!  Their Churros are awesome. They are bring with a maple marmelade too tasty, without too much sugar. So if i come again it's only for the desert :)"}
{"text":"Authenticité et convivialité. Les churros sont décadents, clairement les meilleurs en ville, chauds, croustillants à l'extérieurs, moelleux à l'intérieur, accompagné de dulce de leche crémeux, bien présentés, c'est le summum."}
{"text":"The food was good but simple and prices were well matched. Chicken is fantastic. Mexican seviche was delicious. Fajitas were a bit salty for me but portions were generous and well cooked. Our waitress was on her own with about 20 tables so it was a bit slow at first but when she was with us she was 100% attentive and friendly so we didn't mind the (short) wait. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Augusto Al Gusto est un restaurant péruvien qui offre une cuisine plus populaire que ses confrères. En fait, le menu ressemble à s'y méprendre à celui d'un restaurant mexicain typique... Lorsque j'y suis allé, j'ai pris une assiette de quesadilla en table d'hôte. L'assiette principale était énorme et le serveur m'a même demandé si j'en avais assez. Aussi, je n'ai pas pu finir mon assiette, qui était pourtant très bonne, et le serveur a insisté pour que je mange mon dessert. Le personnel est vraiment très avenant et très sympathique."}
{"text":"We ordered fish and chips and enchiladas. The enchiladas were made with the wrong sauce and the fish had a really strong taste and was not well seasoned. I ended up eating only the fries :/"}
{"text":"The only dish on the menu that was good is the ceviche. That is why  Im giving a 3 star. Our waiter was not helpful on explaining what's on the menu. No description on the meals what it comes with. I thought I ordered Grilled chicken boritto ended with processed Mcdonald style nuggets. This restaurant was on MTLBLOG for good churros. The only dish that was good is ceviche and churros. If the waiter was able to describe the dishes better and the menu had description this experience would have  been better. To many other choices in montreal  won't return."}
{"text":"Chef Savaria & staff are super friendly. The roasted chicken plate for $10 is a no brainer and soo yummy. + it's kid friendly. Love that place! #VerdunLuv"}
{"text":"Délicieux et sans flafla! Service et ambiance sympathiques! Les curros sont DÉLICIEUX!"}
{"text":"My visit to this place was very disappointing. Not only that they sat us on a wet table, they don't bother wiping it for us. My food arrived after a long wait. I lost my appetite by then. Thanks goodness the sweet dessert redeemed it. Not a good memory to remember."}
{"text":"Insanely amazing! We ordered some sort of different kinds of meat platter that was made to feed 2 people, which was 40$, and was the most expensive thing on the menu, but when you think about it, since it's written that it's for 2 people, it's really 20$. What we got could have easily fed an extra person fully, and it all tasted amazing xp The steaks were so tender and as delicious as the way my dad makes it at home, and the fillet mignon on the skewers were to die for xp They were huge and juicy and oh so tender xp We ordered it medium rare, asking for it to be more on the rare side. Nothing tasted raw or even felt raw, it was just amazing xoxo The porc chops that came with it were not bad, a bit on the dry side for me, but my bf still liked it. The chicken was way too dry for me, I didn't finish it, but my bf still liked it a lot. The potato slices tasted really good, it was like they were baked AND fried, and soaked up the juices of the meat xp The salad was really something else. Very good portions of different kinds of vegetables, I like the addition of avocados in it, and the salad dressing was also really yummy and a style I'm really not use to but enjoyed experiencing. The meal also came with a spicy green dipping sauce for the meats, which was also very delicious and I couldn't tell what it was made out of. Over the years, I've given up on ordering steaks at restaurants because usually eventhough I ask for something juicy, they give me really dry meat, which I can't stand, so I'm definitely keeping this place right in my memory bank!  The decor was neat inside, a lot of dark woods, we only sat outside in the terr-ass to wait for our food to go, because we had gotten there right before closing time, and they were nice enough to take out order anyway. The workers were very kind and polite, and we didn't have to wait too long for our entire order, which when you think of it, is a lot of meat lol but it was awesome! I'm totally down to go back and order the exact same thing! I can't wait!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I love going there for an unexpensive restaurant dinner. The owner is sweet and the food is good. I don't have a thing to say against that place, it's always been a fun experience!"}
{"text":"We are new to the Verdun area and are testing the local restaurants.  This is definitely a \" going back\" place. It is not fancy or pretentious. Clean , simple and enjoyable. Service was excellent even if there was only one waitress on a Friday night. Food was very good: Mexican ceviche was a very good surprise. Roasted chicken came with generous portions and was moist and delicious. Fajitas are , again generous and tasty. If you want a fancy, fine dining experience try somewhere else. If you are looking for good, tasty and very reasonably priced food.... highly recommended! Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place because I ate at villa Wellington the day before (must try it) and the owner's son said this was his brother's place right down the street and I gotta try it. Service was Mehh, the table wasn't set up, had to ask for a glass of water half way through the meal, the waiter didn't seem like he was all there! They weren't even that busy on sat night. Food was not what I expected, I ordered Loma Saltados and the rice was super dry, and the meat was super chewy. I was not impressed at all. I'm giving it 2 stars because it was clean and I guess they tried!"}
{"text":"Excellent Resto manger toujours bon  Service excellent  Bon choix de vin et bière et une très bonne sangria  10/10"}
