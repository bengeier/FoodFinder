{"text":"Food is better than the Pho on 7 that was there before, but interior wise it's basically a name change. 

4 stars because it's close by and it does a decent Hainan chicken rice (see photo). Pho is OK with the broth not too oily which is often a complain for my wife. Spring roll (non-fried) was ok. And price is really reasonable so there's no reason not to go back for lunch and try other items.

Unlike Jen K. I have no issue with them having a mix of food styles on their menu. It really isn't that huge of a menu. I mean compared to the one at Grand Lake by 7 and Kennedy (and that's a cantonese food only restaurant) it's positively tiny a menu. To put in to perspective it's a smaller menu than many other HK style cafe in the area."}
{"text":"Can't compare to previous Pho On 7. 
I ordered Large size Pho with Beer brisket. Doesn't take long to come because only 3 table included myself and it is 1pm lunch time. The soup has no taste, noodle using the Chinese flat noodle instead. The major issue is only come with 5 small pieces of think brisket. And it is $7.99. ;((
My son ordered beef ribs raman and 2 piece ribs only with mild taste soup. 
No going to come back...."}
{"text":"Here are my 2 cents

Pricing - standard for most pho places

Wait - waited about 30 minutes for the food because the computer wasn't working, it took them about 25 minutes for them to realize the order didnt go through and there were probably only 2 other tables at the restaurant.

Food - Ordred the spicy laksa noodle, was missing the coconut element to what is normally in a laksa.  To my surprise, not sure if they ran out of the regular yellow noodles its supposed to come with, but they mixed rice noodles with it.  Friend ordered the vermecelli and the noodles was not what you normally find from most vietnamese places, the noodles is more doughy than usual.

In my opinion, there are a lot better pho places within the area.  This place is not terrible but not worth going to over the selections you have within a 2km radius."}
{"text":"food is mediocre at best, price was meh, forgot items ordered. will not return; big head prawn is better by far."}
{"text":"Always pho noodle soup
soup-not so good, feels like a lot of msg
noodle-portion is small
beef-small portion as well
note-they don't have the tradition set up correctly......they cook the sprouts already....."}
{"text":"After staying at the Hilton next door numerous times, I have stopped into Pho Trend to grab both lunch and dinner.  I'd really like to go with 2.5 stars but I really have experienced a lot better so 2 stars it is.  The service has always been great and very friendly... the food just doesn't make me want to come back outside of convenience to the hotel."}
{"text":"I returned twice since.  I ordered spicy Laksa noodle and special spring rolls.  The spring rolls, while looked different, were not special enough to be worthy of $6.  The spicy Laksa noodle was okay.  Portion was good and there was good amount of meat.  I wished the sauce was spicier.  This is the only spicy noodle option on menu, why not make it actually spicy?

There were a few families eating Cantonese & Vietnamese dishes (on the same table) while we were there.  I probably will try their Cantonese dishes next time.

I still like Pho Trend due to the convenient location and the clean interior.  Really, the interior decor, the tables, even the restroom is clean. Service is okay.  

Free Wifi - ask waiter for password.

Overall, 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Came here last night for dinner.  I don't think I'll be returning any time soon. 

This is my second time here, this time we ordered a Hainan Chicken w/ Coconut Rice and Fried Spring Roll, Sugar Cane Shrimps, and Grilled Chicken Vermicelli.  The Hainan chicken was bloody, not fresh, and had inconsistent taste, the coconut rice tasted a few days old with no hint of coconut flavour.  The Grilled Chicken had thick fatty skin and the Vermicelli was actually Rice Noodles which was not cooked properly and lacking flavour.

Last time I ordered a Pho and it was definitely not memorable.  Ok but not on par with other pho places in the area.

I am not sure if Pho Trend is better than the Pho on 7 which it replaced, at least Pho on 7 had discount breakfast specials which were super cheap."}
{"text":"This place isn't too bad but I've tried better. Minus two stars for the noodles they used and also the customer service. One never been so furious.. The serves are rude.. I don't think I will be coming back any time soon. It's worth trying out!!"}
{"text":"2.5 star 

Pho Trend really needs to work on their identity. The menu has this mixture of Vietnamese and Cantonese food. 

Pho Trend might be like a lot of restaurants nowadays is they want to have this huge menu that offers everything but nothing is good enough or outstanding enough to worth people to come for repeat visit.

We ordered:

Special Pho Large ($6.99)
- Portion is really good for the price
- Soup though is not hot enough
- The soup based lacked the complex taste of herbs, really one dimensional

Vietnamese Style Laksa Noodle Soup Small ($6.49)
- Really light curry broth, similar to Singapore laksa but lack the coconut milk and the intense flavour
- It supposed to be a house special, chef recommendation but it really not executed well
- broth lacks flavours, noodles overcooked

Spring Rolls ($3.99)
- Too much taro in the filling and taste just too mushy...
- Chinese egg roll paper used instead

Almond Paste Soup (complimentary dessert) was a nice touch, but instant almond paste that I can make at home and way too gluey....

Pho Trend is relatively new and hopefully it will improve over time. Nice decoration, friendly services but the food is just disappointing."}
{"text":"I came here in January - I was very happy that this was so close to my hotel!  The pho was tastey, though could have used a tad more spice - very generous portion, and I ordered the fried chicken wings and they were big, juicy, crispy and flavorful.  It was a bit more expensive than I had hoped, but the service was good, I got to watch some silly Tawainese gameshow, and it was clean and nice inside.  I would come back for a quick eat."}
