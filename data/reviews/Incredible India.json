{"text":"Truly incredible. Accidentally discovered the restaurant on Yelp while surfing, and am so glad we discovered it. Drove from Niagara Falls to dine there for our anniversary. Absolutely worth the drive. Intimate, quiet private dining at its best. Although the enticing  menu on the website is not launched yet but the limited take out/ dine in menu made up for it.  The menu on paper looks pretty standard but the best part is when the food arrives to your table. Fabulous and creative presentation, very symbolic of upscale fine dining with generous portion sizes. Flavour profile and taste were truly impeccable, not the watered down Canadianised Indian food in same gravies. Every dish was distinct in every way. No compromise on flavours. 
Small gestures like an on the house salad and papad were sent during the meals. We were  blown away when husband wife chef duo Parthiv and Anagha came out to wish us and thanked us for dining with them; hospitality at its best. The dessert sampler was a killer. 
Can't wait to be back soon. I am a chef and I truly recommend this incredible gem of a restaurant. A must dine. Five stars."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian restaurant I have ever visited in North America. If you are in Toronto area you must visit. The chef is very polite and service was awesome. The food presentation is really incredible doing justice to the name."}
{"text":"My partner and I went there after he came across the Yelp review. We weren't sure about a restaurant in a strip mall but weren't we proven wrong. Amazing from start to finish. We had mango lasso to drink, paneer fingers, he had the homestyle chicken, I had the kadhai chicken with rice and naan bread a la carte. Our meals were highly recommended by our gracious server Abby. It was all well prepared, generously portioned, well seasoned and fresh. My hubby and I can be selective in our taste but everything was delicious. Our bill came to a reasonable $50. Both of our meals yielded left overs but we left more than satisfied. The decor was beautiful, tasteful and the dine-in experience was executed flawlessly by Abby. We will be back."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday must a very nice place. The food was incredible. Will definitely go back again. What i found interesting you can see inside the kitchen while they cook."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!  We called to check what time the place is open till and we're told to come in and when we go they tell us we can't dine in now as they are booked. We called and they didn't take the reservation and they take others reservation. Very disappointed. Would never go to this place again. They don't even know how to take care of customers"}
{"text":"Starters was good but we are disappointed with main course...all curry was bit sweet and too oily. They have to look into the actual taste of curries."}
{"text":"Talk about presentation this is how you do it ! The food was very flavourful and tasty. We had corn pakora and garlic chicken and veg and non veg thali."}
{"text":"Incredible food and incredible service at Incredible India; they chose a fitting name for the place. I was initially hesitant walking in despite the good reviews because it looks like your everyday lunch take-out joint. My mind was quickly changed once the friendly waiter started speaking with us and even more so once the food started arriving. 

We started with the Lasooni chicken tikka, which was tender, full of flavour, and beautifully presented in a mini tandoor with a coal cube creating a smoke effect. For our main, we had a delicious house-made garlic naan and the murgh kali murch, recommended by our waiter, which was also fantastic. Notably, everything seemed super fresh and seemed to have been prepared to order. We could even hear the ladies in the (open) kitchen patting the dough for the naan. 

Above all, the service was very impressive. Our  waiter (we wish we'd caught his name) was very attentive and made thoughtful recommendations. We will 100% return and only wish there was a location downtown Toronto, as there's no Indian food of that caliber anywhere close to where we live.

Finally, the value for money is outstanding. Our bill for two of us was less than $40."}
{"text":"Incredible. I didn't see a single dish for over $9 on the menu. Although small, this place rocks it with incredibly robust flavours, a good variety and a price you can't beat.  Normally, cheap prices mean cheap food, but not here.  Incredible.
I sampled a few dishes that had varying levels of heat.  Their hottest dish was still enjoyable since the flavours weren't masked by pain.
Too bad this place is fairly out of the way for me--still, I'll drive out of my way to get here."}
{"text":"Service was horrible even after waiting for half an hour to be seated and another hour to get our food we still did not receive our food, and what we got was not the greatest either unless you have all day and nothing better to do only then I recommend you come here"}
{"text":"Great prices and tasty food. Maybe not the typical dishes you see on a westernized Indian menu, but that's what makes it different and good."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Incredible India.

The place was very aesthetically pleasing.  Very well presented.  They had an open kitchen and everything was very clean.  The place looked good and smelled very good.

I have to be careful of what I eat because of some food issues that I have.  I asked if they had any food that was gluten free.  They were very knowledgeable about it, and also asked me if I could have dairy.

The food was very good.  I had two very good chicken dishes, as well as some Chana Masala.  I shared it with a friend.

The portions were very large.  The prices were extremely fair.  I was shocked at how reasonable the prices are.  They have just opened, so I am assuming that this will change.

The food was well balanced, and to me was more typical of Pakistani-style food.  I quite enjoy Indian and Pakistani food, so it was very enjoyable.

The seating would handle a small party, so you may want to call before going.

Excellent experience and fantastic decor!"}
{"text":"Their website has an interesting dine in menu, which attracted us to come in. I was disappointed to find out that they haven't started to serve the dine in menu so you are forced to order off the take out menu regardless of if you eat in or not. Also, found that they only serve the thali on the weekdays, which isn't posted on their website. We decided to order the paneer fingers, chicken tikka, fish pakoras, karahi chicken and the goat curry. The food does take a bit of time to prepare but overall the food was very good. 

Each item was fresh and we found the fish pakoras really generous portions. The chicken tikka was spicy but a bit too salty.  The prices are very reasonable for the quality of food that you get."}
{"text":"The food was very delicious. The prices for each dish was very reasonable depending on the portion and size of each dish. In the name Incredible India, when they write incredible then they actually mean it because of the taste of each dish and the service. The staff was very polite and I absolutely 100% recommend this restaurant to whoever likes Indian food and would like to have a 1st experience of Indian food."}
{"text":"This is really nice restuarant, the ambiance is amazing with open kitchen concept 

The presentation of food was also very good which gives feel of top notch restaurants 

I would definitely recommend this place"}
