{"text":"5 stars for what it is...good food, good price, and excellent service. The staff is incredibly friendly! Nice to get a solid meal and not have to worry about dressing up at all!"}
{"text":"I love coming to Don Jose!! They have an extra hot salsa (you have to ask for it) for all my other spicy lovers! The service is always great here. The owners are very hands on they even have a food truck they take out sometimes. My favorite thing to get is the enchiladas"}
{"text":"The bomb dot com. I feed my unborn child Don Jose. I feed my grandma Don Jose. I hear angels sing when I bite into those pork tacos. Machaca is on point. Chicken tacos are delicious. They even have good desserts. Plus it's all cheap. I LOVE THAT SAUCE."}
{"text":"I am writing this review to help out those people who use Yelp to actually find what a restaurant is like before they patronize it. I believe I owe it to those folks, as that is what Yelp is all about, after all - finding out what a business is really like before patronizing it.   Don Jose was recommended to me by a friend, who, over-the-top with excitement at me being new to Phoenix, insisted we go there for a meal. She has been going there since she was a kid and excitedly relayed her excitement at the delicious food and low prices.  We all have places that we give good reviews to based purely on nostalgia and not on objective observations. My friend is clearly in that camp when it comes to this restaurant. So let me tell ya what you'll REALLY find if you come to Don Jose, for those of you who actually want to know.  The food is nasty!  The salsa is a boring watery puree of tomato, chili powder, and maybe a bit of garlic powder. The chips are the cheapest most pathetic kind of tortilla chip there is - super thin that break easily, stone cold, just blah. (And no refills! Gotta purchase a second bowl if the first tiny bowl is not enough!) The enchilada sauce is a repulsive orangey-brown color, and matches the neon-orange-colored \"cheese\" that tops everything (quotes around \"cheese\" because I sincerely doubt it is actualy dairy cheese). Anything battered and fried (such as chimichanga or relleno) is soggy and oily. The beans are fine, but again, bland, tasteless, just drab.  The decor is plain ol' cheap. The drink glasses are plastic, many of the forks have bent tines, and the napkins are thin and don't hold up at all. You can enjoy a nice bouncing experience as the booth next to you/behind you is rocked by little out-of-control darlings belonging to the parents who grew up eating this slop obliviously chow down. Combined with the broken spring trying to push through the vinyl seat, and you may get a sexual thrill you didn't even know was coming.  So there you have it. I don't like this place, but clearly a lot of people do. Oh, and bring cash - they don't take any cards, and the ATM has a good stiff fee."}
{"text":"Went with the fam tonight and it was just like old times.  Nothing has changed, thank heavens.  Hot sauce and chips: just right, not greasy.  Small, plastic tumblers filled with crushed ice--yes.  Combination #6 is my current favorite.  Enchilada sauce: not too thin not too thick.  Taco: small and crispy, not some huge crazy size.  Shredded cheese:  a nice sprinkling over taco, tostado, and cheese enchilada.  Cash only.  It's back--yea!"}
{"text":"ive always been a big fan of don jose as a kid. went here for my b-day and loved it. other than the flat screen tv, it looked exactly the same as it always has. im pretty sure the prices havent changed since the 80's either. the staff was very accommadating  with our needs as vegetarians. the only thing missing was the beer! ive always loved this place, and i hope it does well. i even bought a shirt!"}
{"text":"This place was exactly what we needed. After hiking three days in the Grand Canyon, we wanted good, solid Mexican food in an unpretentious atmosphere. We also needed a place close to the airport. The staff was friendly without being fake, location was good, and food did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Yum! They were good 20 years ago. They are good now. They have a bigger menu since reopening. Green corn tamales! Try the blueberry baby chimichangas for desert. Basic but good mexican food. Yes, its cash, but get over it. The only thing I miss is the original green sauce."}
{"text":"Well if you check and read my last review, I gave Dons a 5 star rating, but now I have to edit that.  Just to refresh I have been eating there since it opened.  Of course it was closed 3 years and I was glad it reopened.  Now to be honest there are other things to be considered when you choose to spend your money so Ill get right to the heart of why Im pissed off.  I put up with the lousy decor and an occassional spring in my ass and that they have not changed anything in 30+ years,, But that was all cool cause the prices were good and so was the food, but in 9 months they have raised their price 20 percent, why?  Those booths tables and everything in there has not changed in at least 25 years.  You see they think they have got the market cornered, so plain and simple its GREED.  Part of the alure of Dons was the good deal!  Who do the think they are,  Macayos,  Manuels, Ajo Als,  These are nice place with ambiance.  Dons is a dump, (have you gone to the restroom, it smells in there cause they have done nothing in years).  The new owners just are charging what the market will bear and if your all cool with that good for you, but I'm (at my age) tired of bending over and grabbing the ankles and Those new owners can Kiss my rosy backside.  Thanks for reading and for the few real people that get where I'm comin from I appreciat the hell out of you.  And thats  \"THE TRUTH FROM THE TRUTH\"  CIAU"}
{"text":"Great food, good memories... Must pay in cash is the only issue. However, it's family owned and you can appreciate the passion of a small business owner through the quality of the food.  I've asked several times, they swear there's not secrets in making their ice tea. But, for whatever reason it's very very refreshing!   Chips are made fresh and the salsa has a nice surprise heat. \"Just\" spicy enough, you could eat a couple gallons of the stuff and not get tired of the flavor."}
{"text":"My favorite sit-down place for no frills tacos.  The shredded beef tacos have a very good amount of meat, cheese, and not too much garnish. The beef is well seasoned and have never been dry, stringy, or too drippy greasy.  Their chimichangas are really good, too. Medium in size, they're deep fried just enough to be crispy all around without overcooking the inside. I sometimes get them enchilada style but the red sauce isn't as awesome as the salsa.  The salsa seems like it's tomato-based and it's a little on the sweet side but there's lots of flavor in it and about medium in heat. It's definitely unique. It goes really well with the tacos and chips,  The Mexican Pizza didn't have a lot to it if you're looking to fill up. The cheese crisp comes with slivers of green chilis - a little bland for me but I'm used to having chilis cooked with some sort of savory meat. The enchiladas are great and are really gooey-cheesy.  The seating is a little tight along the middle row of tables and you'll feel every shift in weight of the people behind you in the booths. The building has a sharply tapered roof so when hell freezes over it'll handle the snow just fine. It's cash only but there's an ATM at the entrance. Additional bowls of chips are charged extra. The service is pretty quick and drinks are refilled promptly."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre or less. They don't tell you that it is a cash only business. They have an ATM conveniently set up in the lobby with a $2.50 fee to take out your money. It is cold outside but they do not have a heater inside. I will not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"It's back, baby. And unlike most sequels, this one's as good as the original. In fact, the new Don Jose is so perfectly recreated that it's like they never left. The new owners are incredibly nice, and most importantly, they loved Don Jose as much as we did, and took great pains to get it right--including partnering with the original owner and family to make sure everything lived up to the name. I've eaten there twice since the reopen and it was like coming home again. I gained five pounds in a week, sure, but that's a problem for another day.   Sure, foodie hipsters might not like the place--oh, they didn't redecorate! Waah, they didn't have huitlacoche or cochinita! Insufficiently complex notes in the salsa! Not enough bacon and bacon-related accessories! Egads, cold beef sandwiches!--Boo frickin' hoo. If you care about that stuff, this is likely not the kind of place you'll dig. I totally get that. I feel the same way when I go to a Mexican place that serves squid. Here's the purely objective truth: It's a little bit of a dive but that's just how we like it. It isn't \"foodie\", it's actual food. It's not trying to be anything it's not. No new frontiers or exotic taste adventures here. Just simple, tasty comfort food--classic Arizona Sonoran, with enough vintage American diner-style items to keep the grandparents happy--at a low price, in a warm, clean, classic, friendly old-school environment. If you dig that, you'll love it. If you need more, you'll find it elsewhere. Here the salsa's still tangy, the chips are just right, the beans--delicious. Tacos, burritos, enchiladas, combos, the works--just as it was. All is right with the universe."}
{"text":"I have been going to Don Jose for as long as I can remember, so like everyone else I was devastated when I found out they were closing.  I had mixed emotions when I found out that they would be reopening under new management.  Would the food be the same? Would the service be as good or better?  Since Don Jose reopened we make it a point to go for lunch or dinner at least a few times a month if not more.  The owner is awesome, super friendly walks around and talks to everyone.  He always makes us feel welcome and takes time to BS with my boyfriend about things they have in common.  The food is great!!  Simple, cheap, but great.  The service is amazing we never get bad service, EVER!!  To address things some others have said:  The building:  Is it some fancy, typical Mexican decor you get at chain restaurants?  No, that doesn't mean it's a nasty run down place.  Cash only:  Don Jose has ALWAYS been cash only, if you read reviews before you go you would know that.  They did provide an ATM, which like any other ATM that is not your banks charges a fee.  (Oh well)  The whole point behind cash only is to keep the prices of your food down.  Have you ever owned or operated a business?  Do you know how much credit card processing can cost?  I am perfectly content making sure I have cash on hand when we go.    The food:  Is great!!  We each get a cheese crisp to start, my boyfriend normally gets 2 shredded beef tacos.  And I get one chicken taco.  My boyfriend absolutely loves their tacos, never dry always flavorful, never disappointed.  The chicken tacos come with a jalapeno  cream cheese, which I do not care for so I ask for the taco with just chicken, cheese, and lettuce.  Not once in my time coming to Don Jose has my order ever been wrong, cold, bland, or bad.    The service:  We are the in and out type of eaters.  The staff knows us well and caters to us very well.  Our drinks are never empty, the salsa is never empty, and the food is always brought out promptly with a smile.    Maybe we are experiencing a different place then some of those on here that have had horrible experiences.  Or maybe it is because we are polite to others and they return the common courtesy they have been extended.    Either way we love Don Jose, the food, the staff, the whole experience.  And we will continue to give our money to the small independent companies that help stimulate our local community.    Keep up the great work guys!!  See you again soon!"}
{"text":"I personally have been here since the 70's, brought friends and family and solo, service is excellent, prices are good as they always been. Generous amount of chips, salsa and now free refills. Matt and co have got the food down to a \"t\" like the elias family. I believe if you grew up here, you appreciate the old time retro look inside and out. Just the way I like it."}
{"text":"I have been going to Don Jose ever since I can remember.  I love the chips and hot sauce.  I always get hot sauce and chips to take home.  My favorite item is a beef burro enchilada style with a side of beans.  Their enchilada sauce is the best.  They also have the best cheese crisp in town.  I haven't found a cheese crisp that is as good as a Don Jose cheese crisp.  You must try the cheese crisp."}
{"text":"Ok, I have to try to take this star rating of this place down a little. For the sake of those that pick a place based on the ratings, I think I owe it to them.   I have lived by this place for years and always wondered why they hadn't torn it down because it was empty, and then one night the place was packed. I was very intrigued. And then when my husband described his receptionist declaring the reopening like it was a state holiday (with tears in her eyes) I thought \"I gotta get me some of that!\"   We decided to go on an off hour on a Saturday and there was still a 45 minute wait. I liked the old inside, the no need to upgrade attitude was just my style. All of the anxiously waiting people and being right near the kitchen while waiting...I was screaming on the inside with excitement for the sure pleasure my taste buds were about to be hit with....and then we were seated.   First, no alcohol. OK, this is a newly reopened place and may not have their license yet (darn I wanted a margarita!), oh well diet coke it is. They bring out a 6 oz cup of drink, a little syrup container of salsa (cute!) and a bowl of chips. I finished the drink in two sips, the salsa had no flavor, and I avoided the chips after the drink because I think the server was a blackbelt in avoiding interaction once the order was placed.   The food came (and finally a refill, which I should have asked for no ice because the ignoring annoyed me the most) and we began to chow down. My husband got the chili relleno and I got the cheese enchiladas. My first bite I thought \"hmmm this reminds me of that frozen crap my mom used to try to pass off on me\" and I looked across the table to see my husband eyeing my food and his food barely touched. Now, my husband is an ex football player with a huge appetite that used to eat oysters out of a can in college, so that tells you something about his meal. Mine was edible and we shared with an overwhelming violated feeling .   Surprisingly the server was very quick with the bill. I tried to talk my husband into not tipping but he is a gentleman. When I got home I began listing friends that I trusted their opinions to go and tell me that we are absolutely crazy (one of which likes Spam) and should give it another shot. The overall rating...bland, cheap and the salsa scared one of them (she described it like ketchup).   Bottom line, don't be fooled like me. The place is no good and should have stayed closed (and I really wanted to like it!)."}
{"text":"Pretty ghetto. Cash only and Mexican food for gringos, ie not good. They charge you for more chips."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food! Great neighborhood place to eat. Not a fancy joint but great salsa and chips. Take cash, no CC's accepted."}
{"text":"The food here is mediocre at best. I went after reading all the above positive reviews and was really disappointed.  The service was great, hence the 2 stars, but my relleno was soggy and my tamele looked & tasted like it was made in a factory.  The guacamole was decent and at $3 I didn't care that the margarita tasted like a mix."}
{"text":"Don Jose' has the best value and Mexican food in the area. Food tastes the same as it did then, consistency and great food, who could ask for more. Fair prices. Good service."}
{"text":"The service is great and  the \"hot sauce\" is quite good, the beans are not bad, but everything else there that I've had (been a few times to give this place a real chance) is just plain awful - taste like canned ingredients. The food is bland and could certainly use some spices to bring this up to what it's expected to be. Save yourself a trip and go to either of the Carolina's locations for some really great authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Don Jose's for over 30 years. Great food, great service, and low, low prices."}
{"text":"The owner was so rude I walked out! And they only accept cash and the only reason I gave them a star is because the review made me! I mean this guy was ridiculous! I never had anyone greet me at the door like that!!"}
{"text":"So a few of us ordered take out for lunch today.  I ordered the green corn tamale and a side of rice.  It wasn't bad, however it was more something to \"fill the belly\".  It was by far the blandest Mexican food I have ever had.  There was flavor to anything, and the little flavor there was came from the sweetness of the corn.  The overall impression from the 8 or so of us that ordered is \"it was ok but I'm not impressed\"."}
{"text":"My husband's family has been going here for 25 years. We love it and still go there for Mexican food. It's small, and it's meant to have old decor. You don't fix something if it's not broke. We will continue to eat here once a month for the rest of our lives!"}
{"text":"Being from TX and OK most of my life, I have a certain expectation for Mexican food, and unfortunately numerous places I tried in Phoenix haven't fit the bill - until I found this place.  Only drawback is the menu is small (no fajitas for example), but if you are looking for good chips and salsa and a good enchilada then look no further.  Keep in mind this place looks like a complete hole, and only takes cash.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love this place...been eating here for 38 years. Clean, great service, consistently good food, and inexpensive.  Wish they would put some windows back in though."}
{"text":"One day, a few years back, I stopped talking to a friend. I was upset, but dealing well with it, because I was on my way to console myself with a bag of Don Jose's chips and sauce. Then, I saw the For Sale sign on the lot and burst into tears.  This restaurant has been around since before I was born. My dad told me he used to eat here when he moved to the Valley in 1966. So, you can imagine my excitement when it reopened. Especially when the restaurant and food were the same. If you're looking for high quality pretentious style Mexican food, this isn't the place. If you're looking for inexpensive, plain old simple Mexican food, a nice staff, and a good price, pop on over.  I can never decide between the chimi and the Mexican pizza. Pick your own favorite."}
{"text":"Don jose has been my favorite mexican food restaurant for years. I grew up eating here with my family a few times a week. So naturally, I grew to love this place. The service is awesome and the employees are extremely kind. The food is awesome and cheap. I would suggest don jose to anyone looking for mexican food!"}
{"text":"There are not many places where you can get good food at very reasonable prices.  This is comfort Mexican done well, clearly the same way forever here.  What seems to have stayed the same over the years are the prices.  $3 for a bean burrito, $5 for a chimi.  Re-opening look the same with a new a clean kitchen.  Also, free refills on drinks and chips!  That's a good change.  Now that Don Jose is back, so will I."}
{"text":"family friendly, divey little place.  a.m. radio and bullfighter paintings complete with red booths and formica tables.  very old school atmosphere.  this place is clean, cheery, and has friendly charming service and staff who remember your regular order, and sometimes your name.  the food is classic old school sonoran style with gorgeous and flavorful sauces and cheese.  the hot sauce is to die for...served in a thumb- triggered, red handled syrup bottle, just like hot sauce should be.  if you are looking for a sexy date night, this isnt it.  but if you want some good old fashioned mexican comfort food with a friendly smile at a good price, this place is it. love it.  i get takeout from here every week and i marvel at how Fast they are!"}
{"text":"Don Jose's has been one of my favorite go- to places since they opened. The new owners stayed true to their roots of good traditional Mexican food with excellent, fast and personal service. Allison and Matt treat you like family. They have expanded the menu again with some delicious new items like the spicy smoked pork tamale, and chicken tacos with jalepeno cream cheese. Their beans are creamy and so comforting. I am looking forward to trying some of their newer menu items soon. Thanks Allison and Matt for continuing to give us a consistently delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Wow, the smoked pork was fantastic! I had the smoked pork tamales and cheese enchiladas, while my wife had the smoked pork taco salad. We cannot wait to come. Ack next time we are in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"One of the absolute worst Mexican restaurants in this town. The reason it is cash only is it has gone out of business in the past 5 years, it is tottering on insolvency cause the food is so bad. Notice no one is parked in the lot? No flavor, boring, bland are adjectives to describe the food. The food will not make you sick, but you will get better flavors from a TV dinner."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this place since I was in a high chair. I love the humble decor and the great food and service.  Their hot sauce is phenomenal as is all of their food.  This is a family run business and you can tell they care about their customers. Service is great, food is great but make sure you take cash as they don't take debit or credit cards but they do have an ATM in the lobby.  Great Mexican food here."}
{"text":"This place always delivers simple delicious food. Servers and bus help are always so nice. Our family has been coming here for years!"}
{"text":"They had good shredded beef tacos and great enchilada sauce.  Much like Jessica, my family, and others who frequent here, have been going forever.  It's always been there and we thought it always would.  We'll miss it but I have a feeling they'll pop up again somewhere, hopefully in AZ too."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted authentic Mexican food and we found exactly what we wanted at Don Jose!!"}
{"text":"The BEST mexican food in Phoenix. I have been eating here all my life. Except for a few years when I lived out of state and am now back home. Some of the old crew is still there (cooks, etc.) Nothing compares to Don Jose'! The price is great. A cheese crisp is a must before the meal and bottomless softdrinks make it even better! We stop by at least once a week and many times our order has been placed by the time we take our seats. We LOVE this place! There is nothing I can think of that could make it any better. Thank you Matt and crew!"}
{"text":"Don Jose's is a gem in Phoenix eating. Got the beef Chimi and it was awesome. Love their Habanero salsa and their house salsa too. Service was great and the atmosphere the way I like it, eclectic! Classic Rock & Roll blasting in a TexMex is a hoot. Only thing to consider before coming here is the CASH ONLY aspect. Plenty of warnings around, so it won't be a problem, lucky for me that day, I had the cash!"}
{"text":"Got the street tacos n beans, delicious! ! Customer service is  excellent.Very friendly.  I will definitely be  back! !"}
{"text":"I've been going here for at least 12 years. They have great, friendly service, really good sauce with a spicy kick to it. The cheese crisp is fantastic (so simple yet so satisfying) and the tamales and chimichangas are very tasty; vegetarian versions are more to my liking because the beef in the enchiladas is a little dry but the sauce is good. Oh, and please get the Albondiga soup! Clear, tasty broth and lovely meatballs (just too few of them is all).   All of the food is about above average, but not too heavy like other Mexican places and for the price point ($10 for rice, beans, taco, tostada, and enchilada?!), it's verging on fantastic."}
{"text":"Great food, fantastic service, prices are excellent.Refried beans are authentic. Don't miss out on just awesome grub. Remember cash only."}
{"text":"Please remove that closed sign you have written across my old review.  Don Jose's is back in business!  I know.... miracles happen.  After 41 years as one of the best and most authentic Mexican food restaurants in Phoenix Don Joes's closed for a short period of time.  But alas, we can all stop the sniveling.  Don Jose's has reopened after a good deal of remodeling.  The best news is everything else is the same.  All of the great, reasonable and made to order food is one waitress from you getting exactly what we loved all those years of weekly dinner at this family owned restaurant.   Don Jose himself will be right there to greet you.  Same food, same great customer service.  What a great way to start the New Year"}
{"text":"So, my first time yes? I pass by it all the time but never been in... then they closed. Opened up a year later. News did an article on them and everything I'm like yup I'm going there.  Today's the day. Went during lunch, no line.  Large menu and decent dining area, however...CASH ONLY, yes there are many \"small signs\" but i have never bothered eating at a cash only establishment. They have an ATM (fee is 2.50, ouch) but I am warning you now \"CASH ONLY!\"  Pros food came out hot and fast Pros server(s) were attentive and friendly. Pros clean and The chips are awesome. Ordered the chips with cheese.. had the 4 taco carnitas plate. If it's bland please ask then for some seasoning. I liked it because I could actually taste the meat.  I will return.. not very many sit down eateries around here and I am not going to Applebee's ever. So I hope that I have a better spiced meal next time  Pro decent prices. But   CASH Only"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. We both had the machaca chimichangas \"dj chimi\" style. Food was somewhat bland although I can see why a lot of people like it. The portion sizes were good, service was friendly and attentive the food just average though.."}
{"text":"We used to eat here before they shut down. But I am sure the food hasnt changed much nor the horrible rude service. The only decent item was the green chile burritos but still pretty tasteless. I saw the place recently and it still looks exactly the same as it did 8 yrs ago."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of time, and have yet to be disappointed. You start with chips and salsa which are nothing more than average. I ordered the Don Jose Special it comes with a tamale, cheese enchilada, shredded beef taco, and a bean tostada, with a choice of rice or beans. Everything was amazing, my personal favorite was the tacos! It's a small restaurant but don't let the size intimidate you, the food is delicious. Best part is their only 2 minutes away from me :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend has been coming here for years and has turned me onto it as well... I LOVE this place!  Best quesadillas and enchiladas ever as well as awesome service.  Really great family joint."}
{"text":"This place is Yummy. Must get a cheese crisp, with your meal. The only down side is that they take cash only. Wait that's a good thing, because their prices are so reasonable. My friend highly recommended it, and I also highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Same delicious food I remember when I was a member of the family... taco was excellent... tostada was delicious... enchilada was the best...definitely recommend Don Jose's to everyone... Thank you Joe for allowing what you started, to continue on for future generations through new ownership..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat. The owners and staff treat everyone like family, and work hard to maintain tradition of a great family restaurant. You have to have the cheese enchiladas to truly appreciate the place!"}
{"text":"Tried this spot on a recommendation from a friend.  His words \"dumpy building, but great food\".  Oh he was right about the building!  But the food was horrible.  Let me define horrible in my terms- wouldn't feed it to a dog.  The beef taco was so dry even drenching it with their mediocre salsa didn't help.  Save your money, T Bell is an upgrade compared to this joint."}
{"text":"It is what it is and it has been this way for a very long time. A personal favorite for cheese crisps, cold bottles of Coors, and a combination plate that won't set you back to much.  Family traditions reinvented and they hold true to the old family."}
{"text":"Stopped by here cause of some good reviews and cause my hunger! Lol. Anywho, the food was amazing!! The costumer service was great too! Everytime I took a sip of my water it was always refilled right away! I could not never get it empty ! Now to the reason why it's only 3stars... I ordered a chimichanga and for those who know a chimichanga are always very big, bigger than a burrito. So I ordered one and when i got it we'll it was not big. It looked like a quesadilla !! Not even close to a burrito. Other than the small food. Great place. Make sure you bring MONEY!! They do not accept any sort of debit/credit cards."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants, hands down! The food is consistent, fast, and the service is on point. I've been going there since I was a week old and it has yet to disappoint. Great Sonoran style Mexican food, great prices, great service! I highly recommend their shredded beef tacos and beans! Although everything is good! They also have candy up front at the resister that you can buy. Super rad place!"}
{"text":"I've only been here twice, but both times the food has been delicious and the service was great. So much so I felt I need to write a review.  Definitely a spot to check out."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Good people and simple setting. Seat yourself and prepare for some very good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Fabulous food. No I mean Fabulous food. Like the kind you could eat every day.  Best beans in town, great margaritas, great chips. green corn tamales-yum. Bean burro enchilada style-nummy. chicken tacos with jalapeno cream cheese - wow.  That the food was great is part of the experience. The people, the service are outstanding. Did I say I like this place? Try it for yourself."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY- CASH ONLY. CASH ONLY.  Another cheap place that doesn't want to pay credit card fees. Greed rules here.And no, I don't want to pay $6 to use your airport style ATM. Tee Pee is better and takes plastic. Adios Don Jose."}
{"text":"Their red salsa is so addicting and it goes really good with anything. The food always has good flavor and always comes out super hot. I recommend ordering a cheese crisp. The only negative is that they only take cash even though its 2016 -____- so you have to pay the ATM fee to take out your money to pay your bill. So just bring cash when coming here and you'll be fine and leave with a happy full belly.   -to the person complaining that they don't tell you its a cash only establishment, there is actually a big sign that's facing all the tables and if I'm not mistaken more than one around the restaurant saying they take cash only."}
{"text":"I've been coming here ever since I was a wee little kid.  Don Jose's is a family favorite and we wouldn't keep coming back if they weren't doing something right!  The hot sauce is the best I've ever had at a Mexican shindig before and I've yet to find another place that can even compare to theirs!  Love love love, yes triple love."}
{"text":"Good family style Mexican food with friendly service and nice comfortable atmosphere. Great place to go after arriving from the east coast. Easy parking in area with shopping and strip malls. Nothing fancy or put on just simple good Mexican food served the right way."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for lunch. We enjoyed the food and the service. We were welcomed with a smile, our waitress and other staff kept our drinks topped off while often checking in to be sure we had everything we needed. This is not a fancy elegant restaurant... it is a simple atmosphere with good service and simply good Mexican food."}
{"text":"I haven't been to DJ's in a few weeks, but my wife asked where I wanted my birthday dinner on Thursday this week. She said: how about some place new this year...I told her that i would consider it. Nah, I'll see you Thursday for dinner. Happy Birthday to me."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever, just try their Carne Asada Burrito and you will know what I mean!!!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years now. The food is absolutely fantastic. Clean, neat and a fun place to relax and enjoy the great food."}
{"text":"Greasy, flavorless and unappealing. I will not go back here and recommend that you too find an alternate lunch stop."}
{"text":"This certainly wasn't the worst Mexican food I have eaten, but it wasn't the best.  One reviewer claimed the salsa was tomato sauce with chili powder.  It wasn't.  It had a mild flavor with a slight tang of spicy.  It was on par with Pace Picante.  I had the Cominbation #2 with a shreaded beef taco, tamale, and cheese enchilada with rice and beans on the side.  The sauce on the tamale was my least favorite.  The taco was good but nothing to ooh and aah about.  The enchilada was a flat pancake of cheese and tortilla, but it was tasty none the less.  The beans and rice were not on par with my local Mexican joint in San Diego.  The $3 margarita was enjoyable and worth the money.  I have had worse and paid a lot more.  Over all it was an average joint.  But the staff was very friendly and helpful.  Would I go back?  Maybe, but there are a lot of other Mexican places to try before I return."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place. I read the yelp reviews before I visited. I ordered a combo plate with a Taco a Tamale and an enchilada. The food looked the part but it was so bland and unflavored.  There are way to many Mexican restaurants to have such a lack of flavor.  I think the cook needs to revamp the recipes or just add some Garlic or Salt."}
{"text":"Had the smoked chicken burrito and it was delicious. The chips and salsa are very good too. Prices are good and the quality is exceptional. Staff is nice and very attentive. Definitely a must if you haven't tried it before."}
{"text":"I didn't get an entree because they didn't have the type of meat I wanted(shrimp) I was ok with that so I ordered a drink. The margarita was good. Hubby ordered some tamales. They were hot but the meat tasted old so he just ate the outside. They only accept cash be warned."}
{"text":"For delicious, hot, quick Mexican food, you can't be Don Jose's. It's a Phoenix staple. No-frills, just simple food, cheap, and service with a smile. Bring cash only, no credit cards accepted, although there is an ATM  on-site. My favorite dishes are the nachos and bean & cheese tostadas--the pile it with cheese!"}
{"text":"I haven't received my food yet so this is based solely on the salsa - it tastes and looks like tomato sauce. Spicy tomato sauce. That's not what you want in a salsa. Ick."}
{"text":"So far the many times I have been here this is my first review of this place but it's really good. So far the times I have come it has been worth it to drive from where I live to here.. It's quite good and keeps me going back.."}
{"text":"Cash Only!!  Muy importante!  I kind of feel bad doing this because we ordered the cheeseburger at a Mexican restaurant, but even our worst expectations were blown away.  You get a school cafeteria type burger with a patty as slim and small as McDonalds but without the flavor and fried crispy.  It's such a weird texture...  No tomato or onion, just a little bit of shredded lettuce.  The fries were soggy with oil, obviously not cooked at the right temperature and very unappetizingly brown.  Oy!  I wouldn't rate it so bad just on the cheeseburger, though it was pretty darn bad.  I had a burrito enchilada style with some rice and it had much to be desired as well.  It was edible, there's some dry shredded beef in the middle of a tightly rolled burrito.  The \"smothering\" of enchilada sauce and cheese left much to be desired.  I usually don't like a huge pile of cheese on top but this was laughable as it probably covered maybe half the burrito.  I guess the ration of sauce and cheese is about 2 tablespoons.    The chips were good, but I don't think you should be able to call hot sauce salsa.  It's more like hot sauce, no chunks of anything and not much seasoning of anything.  I think I'll check out Del Taco before coming here again sorry to say.."}
{"text":"We picked up tacos, in a variety of flavors, along with sides, to friends who were working on a home improvement project.  Staff was friendly,  helpful and efficient.  The tacos were fabulous, delicious and not what you  find in a typical Mexican restaurant.  Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town! Enchiladas are great. My girlfriend had the chicken taco plate,which she said was fantastic. They season or marinate the chicken just right & they add a dollop of cream cheese to the tacos which makes it very yummy.Beans are fantastic. You will really dig this place. Give it a try."}
{"text":"This place is amazing great staff, delicious food, quick service for a exceptionally great price!! There is not one thing on the menu that isn't cool perfectly and is delicious EVERYTIME!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great atmosphere, Very good food and awesome staff. Definitely worth giving it a try."}
{"text":"Someone I met in Tucson told me about this place and after looking at the reviews on here we decided to go for lunch today. I had the taquitos that came with an amazing jalapeño cream cheese dip. Service was great, our glasses were never empty and all employees we great. We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Spousal Unit has insisted we come here just about every other day since they re-opened!  Its is BETTER every time, these guys are definitely shooting up the learning curve and refining their offerings as the kitchen staff gets comfortable back in that little area where the magic happens.  My current favs are the Bean Tostado (beans are fresh, smooth, creamy and don't seem to have any, er, side-effects if you know what I  mean!) and a crunchy shredded beef taco.  The shredded lettuce is fresh and crispy, good amount of shredded cheese and the Salsa has its Perky Personality back.  Good Work guys!"}
{"text":"Love there red sauce for there enchiladas.. FYI, they only accept cash but they do have an ATM."}
{"text":"I was staying near the airport and picked this location because it was pretty close to the hotel.   The only criticism is their salsa game is weak. More like spicy ketchup. That said - I was hungry, supplemented it with pico de gallo and finished two bowls of chips. So the salsa isn't terrible... but it's weak.  Everything else was perfect. Busy, but no wait. The staff was SUPER friendly. The food was amazing. The rice was some of the best I've ever had in a restaurant. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the chicken taco was a soft taco, lightly toasted. That's a great compromise with real Mexican tacos and American pallets.   I would absolutely come here again. I would bring other people here. This place is a gem. Very reasonably priced too (note they don't take credit cards). Great place!"}
{"text":"We had eaten here two times before, and it was pretty good, which is why we returned.  However, on this last visit, I found a 2.5 inch long bone in my chicken.  When we showed the server, she appeared unfazed and didn't apologize, nor did she offer any type of compensation.  I didn't eat the meal and was still charged full price.  Then, to make matters worse, they asked if we wanted more chips, to which we agreed.  No one said anything about charging for the additional chips; however, we were charged for them on the bill.  This visit turned us off, and we will not likely return."}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck.   The prices are unbelievably inexpensive, especially for the quality and portion size. You get free chips and just-the-right-level-of-spicy salsa. It's a local tradition to start off with the cheese crisp--do it! Everything I've sampled has been great, so you really can't go wrong if you're looking for some delicious, simple Mexican cuisine. Order a la carte so you can sample a few different things (may I suggest the veggie tamales -- out of this world). Also, the staff works as a team, super attentive, and always so upbeat. I especially love the guy who's usually working the cash register--so pleasant to deal with.  Important to note they only accept cash."}
{"text":"Sure we've made great strides since the bean and cheese burrito meals of our childhood.  There is nothing special or unique about the menu. The place is put together with linoleum and Naugahyde. But sometimes you want to go somewhere familiar to satisfy those occasional bouts of nostalgia.  This place or Teepee fit the bill when then those urges happen."}
{"text":"this is the worst service I have ever experienced in my entire life. I get to the restaurant for the first time this week. When I walked inside the owner just got done helping someone he knew by name. My eye caught the special for the day. Never been there before I asked the guy about the special and what it consisted of. no in any way interested and irritated with my questions he finally halfa**ed my order. Right after while I am in the end of my order, this guy decides to seat others  without finishing me. so 2 minutes pass and I finally said \"do you want me to pay or sit down?\" He replies saying \"you will pay with I tell you to.\" By this time I am infuriated by the remark and the treatment I been receiving. He decides to come back 3 minutes later giving me a price for $14 when the special was only $6. Knowing well what I was trying to order I told him to make my order how I wanted it. Long story short he tries to walk me out, and cussed me out along the way. I HAVE NEVER BEEN TREATED LIKE THAT BEFORE IN MY LIFE.  I will never go there again and wont recommend anyone."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place because it's so close to our house & they were so friendly & fast, but sadly everything was just bland. The only way I can describe it is that it isn't bad, but it's not good. I had hardshell beef tacos and they weren't overly greasy, but the cheese had the most flavor and the beef really had none. Rice & beans were the same, just not much flavor. I had to add lots of salt to everything. The salsa is ok and the chips aren't bad. My husband had a chimichanga and it was ok but he said not the most flavorful and \"only time he's ever had to salt a chimichanga\" hehe. Anyway, wanted to love it and it definitely has potential, but it was all very bland"}
{"text":"Was happy that they reopened. Unfortunately due to my diet I can no longer eat there, but I still pick up a gallon at a time of their sauce to use with other items. I used to love eating there, all of their food is great, and I even tried their cheeseburgers back in the day and with a little bit of their sauce it was awesome. I wish I could still eat there, but I plan on bringing my kids to eat some cheese crisps and watch them enjoy the chips & sauce while I sit there dreaming of the past. I'm glad they're back."}
{"text":"Sometimes it depends on what you order.  I have been to Don Jose on more then a few occasions and the quality of the food sometimes depends on what you decide to order.  However, I want to start this review off on a positive note.  The staff at Don Jose is very accommodating and friendly.  You will never have to ask for a refill on your beverage because the servers at Don Jose make sure your drinks and chip bowls are always full.  Today, my lunch companion and I ordered a pork chimichanga and red beef burrito enchilada style.  I have to be honest the food wasn't very good today.  The pork chimichanga was slightly over cooked the and the pork was on the dry side. The red beef burrito was a little on the fatty side, however, the red sauce was tasty.  The service is good, the prices are reasonable, however the food is hit or miss."}
{"text":"Cash only, but there's an ATM.  Dirt cheap.  Just the basics here...tacos, burros, enchiladas, etc.  This is old school atmosphere here, too.  And by old school, I don't mean 2002.  Very bare bones.  In fact, I'm pretty sure I had been in the building before as a little kid in the early 70's.  I know, I look a lot younger don't I?  I felt like it was once the International House of Pancakes, before \"IHOP.\"  Maybe a long-time Phoenician could tell me if I'm crazy.  Anyway, on to the food.  I think Don Jose's is one of those places that if you have a history with it, you love it.  For everyone else, it's just okay.  I had a taco, green corn tamale, and enchilada.  The taco and enchilada were pretty good, but the cheese inside the tamale was too stringy.  And not stringy in a good way because it's hot and melty.  Stringy in a bad way like maybe it was microwaved and then cooled off.  They do things the hard way and serve soft drinks in small cups, but I will say they were never empty.  The wait staff was all over that.    But their cheese crisp is 10 stars!  Just the right balance of crispiness, yet still foldable.  And their hot sauce was pretty good, too!  I'm sure I will be back for that!"}
{"text":"We've been meaning to try Don Jose's for a while now and finally did today.  We both had combination plates and enjoyed all the different items that came out.  Everything was served piping hot and was very tasty.  They make a \"Hot\" version of their salsa which was very fresh and spicy, definitely ask for it!  The service here is outstanding!  I never once waited for water; and as I said, the salsa was spicy!  The servers were on top of everything from taking our drink order as soon as we sat down. to ordering as soon as we were ready, to topping off our drinks continuously and often.  The building is funky and reminded me of an Swiss lodge or an old Weinerschnitzel building.  If you are in the mood for solid Mexican food at a great price, check out Don Jose's."}
{"text":"I have been going to Don Jose for years I love this place the food is great the service is awesome and the prices are great! I would highly recommend them to anyone!"}
{"text":"Don Jose's never disappoints. The food was delicious (the chicken chimichanga fundido style is fantastic) and the service is always top notch. The online ordering option is a great addition because it allows you to use your credit card instead of having to pay with cash."}
{"text":"First time here. Smoked chicken tastes amazing. Salsa is excellent . Water service on point. Food came out quick , hot , and tasty. Decently priced"}
{"text":"Really disappointed with the food. Salsa was very bland, tortillas are store-bought, table was falling apart and eating area looks old and worn down. On top of everything,  they don't accept credit cards...WHAT??? But, you can use their ATM machine on site and pay some crazy transaction charge.  Get with it guys! Join the 21st century and realize that most customers don't carry cash.  Will I be back.....UM, no thanks.  EVERYWHERE else takes credit cards and tastes better"}
{"text":"Perhaps some of the best tacos I have ever had. They had a great smoke flavor to them. The beans and the rice were on par as well.   Our whole table was happy and the service (speed of food too) was really really fast.   I wish they were a bit closer to my side of town."}
{"text":"The food was bad. I ordered the number 6 it looked good in the pictures but it didn't have any meat in it besides the taco. The meat that was in the taco was terrible. We already ate and found out they ONLY TAKE CASH. That would have been nice to know before they sat us down. Bad service low quality food. I would have preferred Taco Bell."}
{"text":"This is a nice laid back cafe atmosphere Mexican restaurant. You get a nice fresh meal for a great price. The cheese crisp is a perfect starter and the chips and salsa are the my too! I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place, the food is always great and the prices are unbeatable.  The food is still as awesome as it was with the previous owner."}
{"text":"This is one of the few places I have been to, prior to reading reviews on Yelp. My mother has come here for 40 years, I figured after that long and she's still coming back, its gotta be good. Boy was I wrong. Her my son and I came here for dinner Friday night, 7ish. Place was jam packed, generally a good sign I suppose. Parking was crappy-ish. We were seated after a few minutes, and provided the chips and salsa. It was just okay. I ordered a margarita, and it literally was 90% crushed ice. I got the chicken chimi with jalapeno cream cheese, one of my all time favorite Mexican food items. It was HORRIBLE! I had the nasty aftertaste in my mouth all weekend. Not only did it taste bad, the cream cheese was put in a bowl on the side, not stuffed in the chimi, warm, where it should be. Lol. Funny, but not. Not when you leave a place with a stomach ache and an empty wallet. Oh and on that note, they only take cash also. Pain in the butt for someone who only carries a card. You know my cheap self isn't paying an atm fee."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday and had a fantastic meal. They recently added some options that haven't made it into print on their menus. We chose the steak and shrimp fajitas. They tasted excellent and came in large potions. The service was top notch as they were appropriately attentive. Also the super spicy salsa was amazing, but don't use too much. Definitely recommend. (The pictures of the fajitas are in the photo section)"}
{"text":"Im going to start by saying I have been coming here for many many years then it closed down and reopened and is now under new managment. Let me start by saying the food is great ! It's actually the customer service that gets 1 star. The owner is rude along with the waitresses. In all my years coming here never have there been issues with ordering extra sauce ... well now there is ... one at a time ... (per waitress). Second : when asked for to-go containers for the salsa they act as if it is coming from the personal stash for their family ... they bring the smallest containers (limit 2) that would be enough for one piece of cheese crisp. .. this place used to be family oriented and would love and feel honored when u would like to take the hot sauce home not it's like restricted, last but not least the owner is NOT kod friendly if u have children who like to play and laugh and can at times b a little loud .... do not come here."}
{"text":"Don't be deceived by the location/outside. This place is like walking into mommas on a Sunday. The service is so warm and efficient. Then comes really great food. I'm innnnn looove with the taquito platter. Also try, carnitas plate."}
{"text":"First, let it be known that this is another Phoenix establishment that I have been eating at for all of my life, with the exception for the past few years while it was (sadly) closed.  I really, really, really like Don Jose.  It's simple, no fuss and very affordable. And it's TASTY!  The staff has always been friendly in that \"neighborhood restaurant\" kind of way.  They hand you menus on the way in and tell you to sit where you like.  The glasses are cheap and brown and plastic, but thanks to the efficient bus staff, never empty.  The salsa (ahem, hot sauce), and chips are simple but yet it's impossible to stop shoveling them in, meanwhile insisiting that \"I'm going to stop with this one, so I have room for my dinner.\"  And then, there's the quesdadilla - flat, thin, crispy, cheesey and delicious!  Is this the BEST mexican restaurant in all of Phoenix?  Maybe not...but what they do, they do very well!  So glad to have them back!"}
{"text":"Friend recommended the place so after driving by hundreds of times, finally checked this place out. Food is decent and came out quick. Service was great. The menu is very limited so don't expect much variety. My only main complaint is that they don't take credit/debit cards. Come on, it's not 1984 - cash only businesses are almost obsolete except for bait & switch gas stations. There's an atm machine on property but there's a charge for using it, on top of any charges your bank might charge. Other than the cash-only issue, it's a solid option for quick, simple Mexican food for decent value."}
{"text":"Yelp Stars - 4 Actual Score - 4.3  I really liked this place. The margarita was good (and I'm a tough critic when it comes to margaritas) and the taco plate was flavorful with that classic Tex-Mex taste. If you're in the area definitely pop in for a meal - it's hard to go wrong here."}
{"text":"Service was very quick, Pacifico on draft, will go back again, remind me of what Mexican food was like back in the 70's."}
{"text":"Consistent quality and flavors. The hot sauce is legendary."}
{"text":"This place gets it! Every member of the front of house team was exceptionally friendly and anticipated my every need. I was welcomed and greeted within seconds of being seated. My water glass was always full. My meal hit the table in an incredibly timely fashion and was delicious! The entire crew thanked me on my way out the door.  It is wonderfully refreshing to find a local establishment with a team who takes so much pride in what they do!"}
{"text":"My review is purely based on nostalgia. Don Jose is the first restaurant I ever remember coming to. That was over 20 years ago. My dad used to go to the old original location at who knows where... So, to say that I know it well and it knows me is an understatement. The nice family who ran it knew our orders by heart and we came about once/week for many years. Imagine my upset to find out it was closing back in 2009. I wanted to have a cry. Even though my dedication had faltered in the past few years since I started college, I was still heartbroken that the old reliable Don Jose would not be there.   In the two years that it was not open, I mourned and craved my cheese enchilada staple, along with my beans and a cheese crisp covered in hatch chiles... Of course, we covered everything in their simple yet amazing garlic-induced red salsa that has a certain jenesequa about it. When I heard they were opening up under a new owner but with the same menus, I teetered. What if it wasn't the same? What would I do then?!?! My heart would fall to the floor and my childhood restaurant ruined... I went for it.   I ordered the same thing I have ordered for over 20 years: Two cheese enchiladas and a side of beans. They tasted... THE SAME! Delicious and simple! Awesome! The salsa? ALMOST the same. There was something different that I couldn't put my finger on. I would almost say they may just use a different brand of tomato sauce, that's how slight it is... And that shows how many gallons of the stuff I've consumed in my lifetime. Well, adieu old Don Jose owners and hola to the new! Thanks for bringing it back and letting me continue the enjoyment in the same old booths I've sat in for years. (But seriously... can't ya'll give those a little more cushion at some point? I was sinking last time.)"}
{"text":"This place has the best smoked pork and smoked chicken I've ever eaten, bar none. Cash only, but soooo worth it. Try a smoked pork chimichanga enchilada style with everything. Decor is pretty cool, I like the paintings (or reproductions, maybe) of the matadors, and the service is pretty quick. Even the complimentary chips and salsa are above average."}
{"text":"My 2nd experience with this restaurant yesterday was NOT positive! A few weeks ago we heard that Don Jose's had reopened so my daughter & I went running over to try it out. The salsa was just as good as it was before but the cheese enchiladas were disappointing. The original Don Jose's cheese enchiladas were the BEST in the Valley. When I ordered a Togo for my husband I was told that they weren't doing \"To Go's\" yet and I would have to put it in the Styrofoam Togo box MYSELF. Yikes! The owner maybe didn't think that there was a liability to his customers by doing that themselves as the plates were steaming hot and I could have burned myself! I scooped the food from the STEAMING plate being very careful not to burn myself. BAD IDEA!   And then there was yesterday. We attempted to go again with some friends of the family. We all \"grew up\" with Don Jose (including my Mom who ate there once a week when she worked at Anita's back in the day) and thought this would be a great restaurant to meet at. My sister, daughter & I were 45 minutes early to the restaurant . To our SHOCK the owner would not allow us to be seated because our \"party\" was not all there. There would be 7 of us and he would not hear of it! Hum...there were two big tables sitting there empty. I told the owner that were were tired (just having finished the Willo Home Tour in downtown Phoenix and saving our appetite for Don Jose's) and would be ordering our drinks and a cheese crisp to hold us over until the rest of the girls came. Nope...would not let us be seated and were told \"that we had to think of him!\"   We then went outside and called the rest of our party and told them that the NEW OWNER would not let us sit down 45 minutes early so we would be going to \"Manuel's\" on 28th Street & Indian School to meet. There we WERE SEATED, spent $85 for the 7 of us PLUS $20 for additional takeout. Sorry NEW OWNER...you missed out on our patronage yesterday and forever! That negative voice and attitude better change because negative publicity travels quickly and in these challenging economic times that is financial suicide... no matter how you try to imatate something that can NOT be reinvented!   Take it from a \"wise Latina\" your customers ALWAYS come first!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food that we have come across in the Phoenix area. My boyfriend and I have been to many locations around the area, and always come back to Don Jose because it's just that good. The food always arrives almost too hot to eat, so you know it is freshly made. The salsa is fantastic! The only slight downside is remembering to bring cash with us since they don't accept credit cards, but we are more than happy to stop at a bank if need be in order to get this amazing and reasonably priced food!"}
{"text":"Consistently good, and friendly people.  100 check- ins due to the weekly need for my fine Don Jose meals. I do like the beans, machaca, chicken and margaritas."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been eating here for years and was so sad when it closed for a bit. The new owners are AMAZING! Their dedication for maintaining the original food and atmosphere yet adding new items that compliment the old is incredible. The food is as good as ever. I truly love this place. Order the cheese chips and tacos!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming for decades! We love the food and the people who work there! Very friendly and fast service! I recommend getting cheese on the chips they bring out!"}
{"text":"Don Jose is my FAVORITE Mexican food restaurant in the valley!!!! I've been eating here every week since I was 5yrs old.  The service is great the quality of their Mexican food compares to none, and more affordable than any Mexican food restaurant in the area!  The owner, Matt, is extremely friendly and cares most of all for his customers. It's great to see its still ran by great people for all these years."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I've been going to Don José for forty-one years and when they closed a few years ago I was heartbroken. Since I no longer live in the Phoenix area it was always my first and last visit of each trip. My son moved here in May and discovered it had reopened. Woohoo! The tradition continues. A number four and a Jose crisp are my absolute favorite. We've been unable to locate anything that even comes close to their sauce. Welcome back."}
{"text":"Love the cozy atmosphere, they are very friendly and the food is great.  Only downside is cash only.  But love this place."}
{"text":"Yay!!!!!  We are one big happy familly that feels like Mama opened her kitchen back up. Basic Mexican food that has it's own special flavor. Nothing fancy and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I just had the most horrific experience with the man at the cash register, whom I believe is an owner.  Let me say first of all that I have been there many times over the last year, the food has been good and the people who work there wonderful which is why I was surprised with the experience I just had.  I am also a woman in my fifties.   I ordered an enchilada & half way through, found a hair.  I pulled it out, put it on a separate plate and made sure it was a hair.  I worked in restaurants for many years, mistakes happen, it was not a big deal to me, other than sending the food back, because I could not eat it any longer, I did not make a big deal of it.  The waitress was busy so I stopped the cashier to tell him.  He took my plates only to return later with one of them insist that it was not a hair but spinach (it was black & grey).  I did not argue about it because it was not a big deal to me.   When we were leaving, I asked him to take off the Spinach and he turned it into a major issue.  He kept arguing that it wasn't a hair but claimed he took it off.  I told him, we will just agree to disagree, and he told me that no we wouldn't: \"I was just wrong. Just, get out of here.\"    I was shocked, got my companions to leave, and told the man that I would not be back.  He continued to make some unpleasant comments so I told him he was being an \"asshole\" and walked out the door. He chased me out the door, half way across the parking lot, and got in my face.  He was so close that my companions thought he touched me, and quickly got between us to back him off.  I continued to walk to my car, he called me a \"bitch\" and threatened to call the police if I returned.  No worries there, we would never go back!.  I truly think the man was on something or is unhinged to turn a nothing issue into something major.   I have never posted on Yelp before, but strongly recommend avoiding this restaurant if he is the owner!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for my entire life.  I enjoy the chips but the salsa is too spicy for me.  So I just eat chips.  Pretty much everything I have ordered is yummy.  My favorite is the chimi of course.  This is where we go to celebrate my grandparents birthday's (they are in their 80s!).  Great family place.  Now that I have a baby he is welcomed and well cared for by the staff.  Basic decor.  Basic mexican food.  Basic prices.  Win all around!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service... if I had to take a guess... it's family owned and operated.  I'm picky with Mexican food, and I think it's great."}
{"text":"Incredible! You MUST try the chicken tacos. The shells are a secret blend of just right and awesome. The burritos and hot sauce are amazing.  They also have a great food truck that caters events and that's where I actually tasted the tacos! Completely and exactly replicated in the restaurant.  yum yum yum!  Highly recommend eating here at Don Jose's!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. Deserves 6 stars. Been coming here for over three years never once been a decline in service cleanliness or quality. You get a server and also team of bus boys constantly refilling your water. The salsa is not a chunky type but it is our favorite we never get tired of it. Spice level varies because it's homemade. But usually between 4-6.  The main enter I usually get is a chimichanga fundido with beans. I have sampled a similar items at nearly a dozen other restaurants, nothing comparable. The cream cheese sauce is out of this world. We start off with a cheese crisp. The cheese on it is delicious. Other delicious items I love are: fries supreme with their shredded beef add beans also shrimp tacos are on point. Laura loves the loose meat plate and many other things as well. I have tried so many things on the menu and am always satisfied with quality and taste."}
{"text":"I love don jose' s! My favorite are their enchiladas! Great food and always great service! 5 stars"}
{"text":"Ummmmmmm....I would give this place a million stars if it would let me.  This place is a family favorite.  Sooooooo yummy.  My parents have been taking us there since I was a baby.  I swear it is the only place they took us out for dinner growing up (well, actually they took us to Ricardo's a couple of times but that place is no mas).  We all love it!  My Dad used to tell my sister and I that we had to have our wedding reception there.  Back then, I was horrified and even cried over it.  Now, I think it is a brilliant idea.  I've never been married but my sister is getting married in October.  Her reception is going to be at The Desert Ridge Marriott---I think she should have gone with Don Jose!  Yeah, it's divey and they don't have limes for the beer but it is the most ultimate, yummy Mexican food on the planet.  The chips and hot sauce are so amazing.  I wish I could hook myself up to an IV of the hot sauce- it is sooooooo yummy!  The enchilada sauce and the beans are also to die for.  Everything in the place is so awesome!  The one thing I am upset about is they took away the orange soda.  I don't know about you but Mexican food and orange soda are the perfect pair to me.  Bring it backkkkk!  :)"}

{"text":"Came to eat here for the first time looking for some good mexican food. I arrived today (Saturday) at around 1:30pm, the place was packed and there were a LOT of children. After being told to sit at \"one of those booths over there\" I seated myself, then noticed an entire spilled plate of food sitting there on the floor below an occupied child seat, about three feet away from me. Now, to be fair it's not fair to review Don Jose on the basis of the disturbing customers, and it wouldn't be right if the owner declined service because kids. But then again, is there a reason there are so many kids here?   I looked around at the build and decor of the place. Feels like northern Mexico. Not rustic, but cheap and simple, and yet comfortable. A bright colored rug / blanket hangs on the wall, drowning out notice of any other wall decor that might have been there.  The food arrived. I ordered a rather complete sampler. Everything was delicious. I washed it down with an over-sized Coke using a way too short straw I kept having to dig back out and hold. Finally, after asking for a check, I had to use their ATM (a $2.50 charge) to pay in cash and walk back to the table to leave some change as a tip. $20 after ATM fees and tip for just my meal. But I was very full of delicious food.  I might be back, probably will, but I'm not a fan yet because of the noisy and messy dining experience other customers gave me and because of cash only payments."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. It's not a trendy hotspot, just really good sit down Mexican food for a great price. I've come here with kids and they were satisfied, too. NOTE: it's CASH only.   Parking is next to the restaurant and easy access."}
{"text":"very good food served piping hot for a great price!  the new owner is really friendly and he has hired a great staff!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing and cheap. Be aware cash only!! You will not be disappointed!! Green chili burrito is excellent, shredded beef tacos were delicious:)"}
{"text":"Don Jose is that place I remember when I reminisce about Mexican food joints from my childhood.  It's not fancy, I don't think they have even one velvet picture of a Bullfighter.  It's an old building, family run using family recipes.  It is good, solid Sonoran style that will satisfy that urge.  I had been working since dawn on this day.  Cutting down a Mulberry tree in my back yard that has become more of a hindrance than a benefit.  I worked with the crew I hired to climb this huge tree and cut it up into pieces.  Most of the trunk was cut up into firewood-sized chunks, which I would split later.  The smaller stuff I loaded onto a flatbed for the trip to the 27th ave Landfill, where it would be turned into mulch.  Waiting in line to enter the landfill, I realized I hadn't eaten all morning.  I was starved.  So was the wife.  After dumping our load, we headed back to the neighborhood.  We had to stop at the bank for cash first, as Don Jose only take cash.  That's a bummer, because if they did credit, I'd prolly come more often.  Anyway, we grabbed some bucks and headed around the corner to Don Jose.  This day they were packed for lunch, with a noisy crowd of revelers in the back.  The dining room is a long, narrow room with booths along the side and tables in the middle.  We quickly found a booth and starting noshing on chips and dip while going over the menu.   I already knew what I wanted, Pollo Fundido.  They do Fundido with chicken, beef or smoked pork, but I was craving that mild chicken flavored with savory spices, deep-fried, then slathered with cream cheese and a delicious blanket of cheddar melted over it all.  The wife ordered a chile rellano.  At Don Jose, this rellano comes with a filling of savory smoked pork, then lightly battered and served with a tasty red sauce.  That Fundido totally hit the spot.  I scarfed it.  The wife doesn't eat pork, so I got to enjoy that smoky-delicious mouthful too.  The refried beans were perfect.  the Iced tea was fresh and cold.  Don Jose, please don't stop doing what you do."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been going here since I was a kid! Prices are super cheap, the staff is always friendly, and the food is always good. Don Jose is definitely a Phoenix staple!"}
{"text":"I swear I drive past this little Mexican restaurant multiple times a week and have never noticed it. One night, we were craving some quality Mexican food and started exploring Yelp to find a nearby Mexican spot that we had never tried and had good reviews. We called to see what time they were closing, because it had conflicting results when we tried to figure it out online. The staff answered and stated that they were closing in 5 minutes, but very kindly said that we could order and pick up if we could make it there within 10 minutes. We don't live too far so it was doable, and we gratefully made our way there while still on the phone ordering. I didn't have too much time to ponder on what I would order so I skimmed through the menu and decided on the shredded beef (machaca) burrito-enchilada style (I'm a fatkid). My man got the combo #1, which included 2 enchiladas, a taco and beans. Both orders smelled amazing, it was hard not to pounce into it in the car. When we got home and started grubbin' it was scrumptious!!! I had to give this place 5 stars based on their awesome customer service and delicious food. I am definitely going to have a hard time ordering something different next time because the burrito was so satisfying. We plan to come back and actually sit and eat for a meal, some happy hour and looking forward to their taco Tuesday! The new menu is a little bit different than the one posted on the Yelp page and they gave us one with our pickup order. I'll post it when I get a chance :). They only take CASH so be prepared!! Definitely a good find, THANKS YELP!"}
{"text":"Dumb ass.  You haven't realized the phone number you posted on you home page says 302 as the area code?  Not 602???????   Idiot."}
{"text":"Small albondigas? One meatball for you. Large albondigas? Two meatballs.  Friendly service, simple food, lots of grease. And don't take the grease comment as a dig: if everything you're eating has been piled high with queso or deep-fried, a little complimentary lip gloss should be expected. That might have provided too much of a mental image, please forgive me.  Tip: Bring cash. But you won't need much, the fare is pretty inexpensive.  There are velvet bullfighter paintings on the walls, which is awesome. And the stinginess with the meatballs? It just keeps me wanting more."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Good Margaritas too. The building is a bit old but decorated  in the traditional 'Mexico' theme:-) Food was good as well and pretty inexpensive, you must pay in cash no credit or debit cards."}
{"text":"Having grown up in this neighborhood I always try to frequent the businesses in the area. Don Jose has always been my favorite for stopping in while visiting my mom's home nearby.  The food is consistently good and the prices are very reasonable.  When I go in the employees are very friendly and always on their toes with water or tea refills.  If you like a place that is inexpensive with great service and delicious Mexican food, I highly recommend it.  I like the lettuce and tomato burrito smothered with green chile sauce it's not on the menu but they make it up for me because I am vegetarian."}
{"text":"Honestly, the corn tamales are divine! I LOVE this place. The only bummer is the salsa, which I'm not a fan of, but the rest of the menu is fabulous."}
{"text":"We got loose meat plates - smoked pork very good,  smoked chicken a little heavy on the smoke,  beef carne asada was excellent!  Beans, rice, and tortilla rounded out each platter, plus complimentary chips and salsa - all fairly standard.  The service was extremely cheerful and friendly, definitely a plus!   And though the building is totally early '70s retro, it's very clean.   Plenty of signs to remind you that they only take cash, but hey - it's pretty inexpensive so go ahead and have another beer.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I've eaten at Don Jose. I use to stop by fairly regularly due to convenience and due to the nice folks there, but I was never passionate about the food. I was in the area today and was curious if a change in ownership had materially changed the restaurant.  The good news for fans of Don Jose is that the restaurant continues to have a very positive vibe. The servers are amazingly attentive, refilling drinks, replenishing chips... before you have a chance to realize you're in need. My server was surprised when I needed a moment to look at the menu, a reflection, I think, of the number of regulars the establishment attracts.  Unfortunately, the food still seems uninspired to me. I like Mexican food that is hot and spicy. I want to have to wipe the sweat off my brow when I've finished my meal. Don Jose has never been such a restaurant. On this visit, I single handedly consumed more than one mini pitcher of their \"hot\" sauce. It's a fine sauce, a nice complement for the chips, but it could definitely carry a little more heat for my taste. Since no complimentary mild salsa is served, I suspect more heat in the sauce is not a practical expectation. My feelings are the same regarding the enchilada sauce. Fine, but bland.  Ending on a positive note, I do plan to return. Don Jose is not a destination restaurant for me, although I always appreciate creative use of a former IHOP location. The people who work here are amazingly efficient and just plain nice, strong reasons for a return visit. I can understand why some long-time customers have a real sentimental attachment to this place."}
{"text":"Looks like E Thomas Blvd is the spot for good Mexican food!  2 for 2 so far!  After my meal last night, the Mexican food bug was implanted in my body and soul.  I needed more, pronto!  I drove down here because of the good reviews on Yelp.  I was happy I took the drive.  They start you out with some chips and salsa.  I then ordered the \"Don Jose Special\" which consists of a beef tamale, cheese enchilada, bean tostada, beef taco, rice or beans and corn or flour tortillas.  This special came with a drink too.  Total was $11.00.  Here is how everything was..............  Chips and salsa-  This was the only thing that I was not truly impressed with.  The chips were nice and thin but they weren't even warm and they weren't salted either.  The salsa that they serve is more of a puree.  No chunks in it.  They both tasted just ok. I've had much better elsewhere although I can think of some places that are worse too.  Beef Tamale-  This was a large tamale stuffed with shredded beef/machaca.  It was covered in red sauce and was pretty hefty in size.  It was a little dry, but the beef was flavored well and the sauce tasted pretty good.  Cheese Enchilada-  I am usually not the biggest fan of enchiladas but this one was great!  Plain and to the point.  Lots of cheese, and lots of onions which I love.  This thing was also covered in their red sauce.  It was really good!  Bean Tostada-  Simple and to the point.  Beans, lettuce, cheese on top of a fried tortilla shell.  I like how it held up and was still crispy/crunchy even though I ate it awhile after it came to the table.  It was a good tostada!  Beef Taco-  A little bit small but packed with flavor.  It reminded me of a Lolitas beef taco, just smaller in size.  The beef was seasoned well and they topped this with a lot of cheese.  I was pretty impressed!  Diet Coke- Coke products which is awesome.  The only bad thing about the drink was the size of the cup it was served in.  Couldn't have been more than 8 ounces.  It was like a tiny orange juice glass.  Free refills at least.  Service was friendly and to the point.  Their a la carte prices on things seemed a bit high so I won't be rushing back to try out other things.  If in the area again, and craving Mexican food, there will be no hesitation to come back though.  Everything was pretty darn tasty and the combo plate was priced well for the sheer amount of food you receive.    Cash only!"}
{"text":"I have recently relocated back to the Valley. After a recommendation from a friend I decided to give this place a try. I was NOT disappointed! Chips and hot sauce were great, just a nice perfect touch of heat. I ordered the smoked pork street tacos and beans and rice. One of the best meals I've ever had! Smoke was not overwhelming in the meat, just perfect! Service was top notch, it is cash only but there is an ATM on site if you don't have any cash. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Drove by a few times, had a craving for Mexican, it was packed, smelled good and we see the sign CASH ONLY!!!!!   Come on people get with times,. The only reason we saw the sign was because no one greeted us or looked at us.  Boooo"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat while visiting Phoenix. The food is always great. The owner was very sweet & awesome while we were there eating a Christmas Eve dinner and celebrating with friends."}
{"text":"Great food for the price.  Everything we had was delicious and tasted fresh and authentic.  Customer service was great!  Bring some cash though, because it is cash only."}
{"text":"Sadly, I don't agree with the high rating that this place has gotten - it was the whole reason we tried it out in the first place.   The food just wasn't up to par. I was looking for that midwest tex mex and it just didn't get there. It was soggy, bland, and boring.  Someone get Phoenix the regular old white queso! Come on! I've searched high and low and it's no where to be found."}
{"text":"Great value for the price! The servers were super nice and attentive. Food is delicious! Probably the best tamales I've ever had. Def will come back."}
{"text":"Been going here since I was born. The best enchilada sauce and beans in the city! Fast service easily get in get out."}
{"text":"I have been a customer since the early 70's going to Arcadia High School.  I can't say enuff good things about this wonderful place; I love everything on the menu, and the prices are great!"}
{"text":"I'm now hooked on this place. My girlfriend and her family have been going here for years. They brought me one time, and now I'm hooked. I love their food. Their Mexican pizza and their White Crisp is my favorite. I highly recommend them to anyone who is looking for a decent hole-in-the-wall place to eat. Only downside, is they are a CASH only business, so make sure you have some before going."}
