{"text":"First time at restaurant, 
Took my 80+ year old parents for dim sum, service was decently fast.  Although we had one of those 'wobbly' tables. It was not that busy in the restaurant.  It was a quarter full excluding the vip rooms.  We ordered the salty fish & chicken fried rice dish (very good), beef rice noodle dish (average), shanghai dumplings (average, a bit oily than normal), fried turnip w/perserved meat (too oily - had to absorb the oil with many servettes).  We did request less oil... wondered if they acknowledged or is more oily than normal? Idk.  My parents didn't like the dishes seem more oily than most other restarants in Toronto to Markham.  If you don't have a cholesterol problem, then go for it.  Other wise, I recommend to skip this one.  I don't have a cholesterol problem, but I rather taste the dishes not the oil.  They get 2 stars for service and ZERO for the food."}
{"text":"Pretty good dim sum considering the price range. It can be really busy at noon in the weekends. The place is crammed with tables and chairs, making it very crowded and noisy. The salty pork bone congee is very hearty with deep fried dough. The best is the salty egg yolk sesame ball with a crispy outside shell and a runny but flavorful inside fillings."}
{"text":"Food was salty and over spiced. All 10 dishes came out within 15 minutes. The service was pretty bad and the lack of staff makes it even worst. 

Overall the experience is below average comparing to other Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Service seemed friendly. The place is in heavy need of a clean up. Especially the seafood tanks. 
The best part is we got charged for tea! $2 x 2...which we never ordered. Unless they meant the one post of jasmine tea that is never normally charged for on the bill."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday @ 1:30pm, waited 2 tables before we were seated.  Dim sum is by paper (no cart) and is one price for all sizes.

Decor, it is okay, nothing special.  Table is clean, they do provide table/public chopsticks which one places don't.  It isn't a very big place, so you may have to spend time waiting for a table.

Food, we ordered roughly 13 dishes, food was okay, nothing special.  Typical dim sum, nothing tasted bad though.

Price, there were 4 of us and total was $13 each after tax/tip which is average based on our previous experiences having dim sum in the afternoon.

I would have no problem returning but wouldn't be a top choice."}
{"text":"We arrived at the restaurant 1:20pm and asked them what time their afternoon specials will start.  They answer 1:30pm and then asked if we are ready to order.  We hand the order sheet in, and when it was time to settle the bill, we were surprised to see the order time was listed as 1:29pm and thus we were charged non-discounted prices!  Not cool.  Food was average. would have rated 2 stars if not for the underhanded tactics described above."}
{"text":"Most dim sum restaurants are pretty much the same, as for Full House..there is really nothing which stands out as too memorable.

It may not seem like it, but the place has very high ceilings for a corner plaza restaurant. A great set back for this place would be the enormous amount of competition this location faces. The corner of the street is buzzing with old favourites, as well as new and upcoming restaurants. I thought perhaps they somehow offered a niche, so I gave it a chance. That, also because I had no cash that morning, and my friend already made the reservations. So I tucked my tail between my legs and followed.

The place is absolutely crammed, until you sit down..where the high ceilings give the illusion of breathing room. I think all I saw were round tables, so I wouldn't come here with less than a party of six. 
As dim sum joints go, this place serves up what any other place does. It was just bland. There is nearly zero d√©cor, and very limited waiting area. If one wasn't immediately seated upon arrival, it would certain become a very awkward wait. I was just very bored here, it made Sunday mornings seem more...Sundayish. 

This place is opened until 4am, what the hell did they serve? I have never seen many cars parked outside on late nights..and it wasn't a popular after hours venue by any means. I consider myself apart of the in crowd..and I have never come here before because somebody really wanted to. 

No fish tanks to look at either...honestly, a full house of what?"}
{"text":"I couldn't help but think to myself that the dim sum here was so yummy while I was eating here - I later found out why.  M-S-G!!!!  I was drinking water like a camel in the desert post dim-sum.  No wonder everything tastes so good!

Their honey-garlic short ribs and tapioca custard crystal \"buns\" were memorable.  I found their shrimp dumpling wrapper to be a bit on the thick side.  I liked that their calamari was only LIGHTLY battered (almost as if it were grilled) versus most dim sum places that put on a full batter.  

Dim sum is about $2 per dish.  

So with that said, the food was really tasty - but I think I am overhydrated now!"}
{"text":"I and my friend went for dinner in the restaurant around 7. The food was OK and the service was nice even the waitress did not speak English that much. Then I asked the server if she could keep the tips. She said no. So when we paid, we did not put tips in the card machine because I want to give some tips for the waitress in cash. But the restaurant owner was very RUDE. HE ASKED ME WHY WE DIDN'T PUT TIPS. I said we would have some change to give tips. So, he got us some change. Then I gave the tips for the waitress but the owner didn't see it. He followed us to the table, starred at us and when we were about to leave the table he asked where is the tips. This made me so angry as I found this gentle man is freaking RUDE AND GREEDY. I told him I gave it to the waitress. He ASKED the lady to and over the tips. I was so so MAD. He was extremely rude and greedy. Will never return this restaurant and I feel so sorry for those who work here."}
{"text":"Food is BAD, service is BAD, price is on the high end, and they don't take any cards. Had to find an ATM to get cash! 

The price is already too high for the quality of food, and I was told I have to pay $3 extra if I pay with card. In the end they complained about not enough tips. How much tips am I supposed to give when they have machine but don't accept cash so that they can avoid tax?"}
{"text":"Happy Mid-Autumn Festival!  Perfect night for observing Full Moon.

As it is a festival day that many Chinese would go out to celebrate with a Family dinner, so did my family.  Nothing too special, it's all about just getting together and sharing some good conversation as a family.

It was fully packed but there was people waiting for just a short time at the entrance.  Judging from this point, it wasn't everybody's must-visit spot to celebrate.  It was a large dining area enough for small banquet if necessary but unlikely.  The Chinese name describes \"Farm Family\" style.

Braised Pork Rib in Spicy Pot($10.99) is advertised from a previous competition but take it with a grain of salt.  It was basically Pork Bone Soup style with Szechuan style whole Red Chili, Radish, Ginger, Scallion.  The Stock was similar to Bak Kut Teh of Singapore fare since it had slight herbal taste.  What I thought would be Pork Rib became Pork Bone(-0.5 Star)

Yellow Fin Grouper 2-ways($28.88):
Stir Fried Grouper with Chinese Kale was A-OK, not too salty or sauced but just a smidge overdone.  Black Bean Steam Grouper on Tofu was as normal as it comes.

I'm a bit indifferent at this place as it's not amazing me but not so bad that I can't eat here.  I give it an additional 0.5 *Star* as the waitress came clean out our dishes full of bones and provided extra napkins without any comment from us."}
{"text":"Amazing Dim Sum. I've been to Toronto twice and came here both times. The dim sum was so fresh and delicious. It was big portion too compared to NYC dim sum. They have this fried shrimp. A must try! (****)

Come here early because it can get really busy."}
{"text":"I usually come to this dim sum place on weekends if we wake up past 9:30 am. This is because other dim sum places in the area are usually packed after 9:00 am. This place opens at 9:00 so we dont usually have to wait for a table. The place isn't exactly the fanciest but dim sum is relatively cheap. Some dishes are more consistent and more fresh compared to others. Dim sum s/m/l monday-friday from 9-11 am, 1:30-4 is $2.48. 11-1:30 is $2.68. Weekends is $2.88 all day. Staff is friendly most of the time. Dim sum dishes I recommend are the bbq steamed pork bun, steamed herbal chicken, steamed chicken bun, steamed pig intestine, their pork chop rice, and steamed beef rice noodle. Although they have other good dim sum dishes too, the taste varies each time I go."}
{"text":"If I can't read the menu, its pretty likely that I'm in the right place.  That is, I'm not going to see much else other than authentic Chinese cuisine.  I stopped in for lunch with one of my employees, since we had an appointment in the area.  This area is filled with great choices for oriental cuisine of all styles, and today there was a distinct need for dim sum.

I ordered a lot of my usual favourites, and a couple of experimental dishes.  Every dish was delivered quickly and piping hot.  We hoovered down all we could and then stumbled back to our cars to head over to our appointment.

There is not a lot that makes Full House stand out, but there is also nothing that I took issue with.  It was a great meal, and a reason to come back.  Soon!"}
{"text":"Typical Chinese dim sum restaurant. Food's been consistently good all the times I've been. Service can be a bit spotty at times but it's still a lot better than some other dim sum places in Scarborough."}
{"text":"I remember going here with my family almost everyday Friday for dinner. So going back here got me quite excited. However, this time we came here for Dim Sum. 
   The ambience hasn't changed much and neither did the service. Nothing too special. 
    Our food came out within a reasonable amount of time. Everything was a little overly salty for us. However, it didn't over power the entire dishes. Portion sizes are average, like at any other Chinese Dim Sum."}
{"text":"Came here recently this past weekend and was extremely disappointed. We were seated in a separate room (smaller room) and had the worse service possible. It was hard to flag down a server as they all were not paying attention or none were in sight. Food was average at best. Had to ask for the bill twice and when we finally got it after a long wait, we paid and they informed us that the tip was not included in the bill. Clearly we are aware of this but tip is optional and none of the servers deserved it to say the least. 

Overall I will not come back here for dim sum nor do I recommend it at all."}
{"text":"We ordered a fish, luckly, our sit is near by the fish tank. We saw they grab a dead fish from the tank and sending to the kitchen. We stopped them immediately and ask them to change a live fish for us.

The food taste is good and they have good service. But I want to tell this restaurant, using a dead fish rather than throw it away may save $5-10 cost, but the customer's trust is more important than it."}
{"text":"We might have been here years prior before with my mom's friend. Grandma really enjoyed this place. We had pigeon, eel, chicken, seafood noodle, fish and a few other things. So delish, the pigeon was really good, I do not remember trying it before. The seafood noodle was alright a bit mushier and underseasoned for me but not bad. The service was so nice very warm and open recommending the best. Felt very welcome here.  It was quite busy."}
{"text":"service was good! server was helpful with our orders and helped us pack the leftovers 

food was fresh too! the one pound of boiled shrimp tastes heavenly and the crab was nice as well 

????? tastes amazing all the sprouts absorbed the pork intestine flavour"}
{"text":"decent chinese restaurant. like all chinese restaurants. i hate reviewing them and same goes to this one. nothing that really stood out to me except for the fact that they were able to make us a dish that was not on the menu. other than the nice gesture. same shit, different smell."}
{"text":"If the dimsum here cost more than 2.08 a dish, I would have given this place two stars. But the reality is, the eight of us ordered 27 dishes and the total was $10 including tips. We had more than we could eat.

The food itself was really bland and not all that great. Only two dishes I had found was actually good, the honey combed stomach and the curry squid. My favourites like chicken feet and veggie dumplings were pretty bland. But it was edible and pretty normal.

The service? We were seated, we ordered the food off the list, and then the food got here. Not much service was required.

I'd come back. But just try to carpool--the parking here is ridiculous."}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant with reasonable prices. 

The decor is a bit run down and made worse by the posters all over. Seating is spacious. The chairs and table seating is a little run down. 

They have live seafood.
The chef is excellent. 
It is quite empty during the weekday. 
Full house also serves dim sum during morning and afternoon dim sum hours for a low price. 

Give this place a try if you want to experience the whole range of Cantonese style cooking from dim sum to mains to live seafood."}
{"text":"The dim sum here just raised it's price to $2.18 per dish, still cheaper than others. If they charged dishes according to size I would be yelling in my review. The deep fried dishes we ordered normally comes out cold. This place was opened for years, so it developed its regulars. Dont be fooled by the line up during weekends, it's only because old chinese people like to go where they feel comfortable, and cheap. If you're looking for a place thats bang for your 2 bucks this is the place to go. If you want quality.. AVOID AVOID AVOID."}
{"text":"This review is based on Dim Sum experience at Full House Chinese Cuisine.

$2.08 each for all the dim sum items on the ordering sheet all day!!! Great value!

The wait staffs though were really indifference.... one of those that pretend they don't see you and most of them just group themselves chatting away at the back of the restaurant.

The dim sums though were meh. The Chicken with Sticky Rice wrapped in lotus leaf was not even heated all the way through. 

I definitely not recommend coming to Full House if you want a decent dim sum experience!"}
{"text":"Service is slow, employees are rude, food is below average. Overall, uncomfortable dining experience.  Boggles my mind how there's always a long wait at the door. 2 stars because it's close to where I live and prices are dirt cheap. You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This is THE place for Dim Sum.
The prices are cheap (everything on the menu was $2.08 each!) as it should be, and the dishes are tasty, fresh and well made.
Everything I had there I liked. Their dumplings and bao's were very good and served steaming hot. I finished off the meal with the sesame balls stuffed with sweet black sesame paste and a plate of the pan-fried water chestnut cake, which were nice.

Get there early as it the place gets really busy and packed -- maybe that's why it's called Full House! Likewise finding parking could take a while here.
This is my grand parent's favorite dim sum spot. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious 
Had no idea this place was a dim sum place until a friend took me here
Usually most people know this plaza for the popular vietnam noodle star or yangs bbq

Rating for dim sum only
Quality is almost on-par to da fu
Been here 3 times recently and nothing here has disappointed
Cheaper morning /afternoon prices for weekdays for $2.38 per dish as of April 2017
$2.58 on regular price on weekdays and $2.78 on weekends

Only thing to let me down
Their service isnt exactly great
Example, happened two times, requested for some hot sauce
I patiently waited 10min
Had to ask again before they actually gave it to me

But its all right
Typical chinese restaurant service
All about the food
That has my approval and will continue coming for the price + quality = awesome value!"}
