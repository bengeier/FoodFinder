{"text":"Stopped at Kabob House for lunch one day and was pleasantly surprised.  Had the vegetarian platter and the falafel was fresh and bright with a nice crispy outside and moist tender inside.  The tabouleh was a treat compared to most other restaurant-made tabouleh.  It actually had more parsely than cracked-wheat, which is how it is supposed to be made.  The hummus was the right consistency with a balance of flavors.  I'm not a big fan of baba ghanoush but it came with the platter and I was pleasantly surprised by the spicy kick.  For a quick lunch on the go it beats fast-food anyday and it beats many of the sit-down Middle Eastern places I've eaten."}
{"text":"Best falafel around.  Very accommodating and equally reasonable prices.  Just wish they were open a little longer."}
{"text":"Very good.  I am part Iranian, so I know my Persian food.  Meat here is cooked perfect...very tender.  Came with a large party once and the owner (who is super nice and accommodating) brought us a sampler of all the meat.   In general, I love to order the ground beef kebabs and lamb kebabs at Persian restaurants and this place doesn't disappoint (I like to add sumac, which is on the table to all the meats and sometimes the rice).

Only disappointment for me is that they don't have a clay oven to make homemade Persian lavash bread like they do in all the restaurants in Atlanta.  Instead you get pita before your meal.  It comes with onion and feta.  You can ask for mint and eat it with the bread, onion, and feta.  Sounds weird, but that is common in Persian restaurants.

Eggplant dip is very good and is a must in any Persian restaurant.  I wish they had more than one eggplant dish, though.  Ice cream is really good.  Baklava is good, but not the best I've had.

Definitely a must try in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"My husband has revoked my Groupon privileges. If this review was just for the food it would be an easy 3 or 3.5 stars. The food was all delicious - we had the sauteed eggplant appetizer, the cucumber/tomato/onion salad, shishkabob dinner and burg dinner (not what I ordered but it was still good.) The rest of the experience was kind of bizarre.

We arrived early on a Saturday evening and were the only dine-in patrons. There were a few booths in the back corner with patrons smoking hookah but it was nearly empty the entire 90+ minutes we were there. There was also some take-out business at the same time. A host led us to a table near the couches/stage area in the back. I immediately noticed that one of the workers (?) was napping on a couch about 10 feet away. 

The music was just something off the laptop of one of the hookah patrons, mostly obscure rap music.

Here's where things got a little weird. We were completely finished eating and the staff was around fixing some other tables (at this point we're still the only dine in patrons), and then they pull some tables together and the entire staff sits down for dinner in the front of the restaurant. We waited another 20-25 minutes for our waitress to come back and ask if we were finished or wanted dessert. The answer was a resounding no."}
{"text":"The deal is kind of fake to bring people here! 
The chicken is good but lamb kabab is not fresh, not worthy for what you are paying.   
And the box for the food is 5$."}
{"text":"This place is a true lunch staple. Don't be fooled by the name -- Kabob is not the only thing on the menu. In fact, vegetarians have multiple delicious options. My favorite vegetarian offerings are the mujadara (lentil-rice plate with salad), falafel combo, grilled veggie skewers, and the fresh watermelon in summer. The salad is 100% romaine lettuce, always fresh and they make their own (DELICIOUS) dressing out of fresh-squeezed lemon juice and olive oil. So the salad combines perfectly into all the other offerings. Especially in the summer, I depend on having salad as part of lunch, and the Kabob house has so many good salad-combo options!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!Very fresh food,friendly owners. The chicken kabob combo with the garlic sauce is my favorite. They only accept cash which tends to be somewhat inconvenient in a plastic society but there is an ATM in the building. Great place to grab lunch."}
{"text":"My first review on Yelp and just stopping through to say that this is my favorite lunch place downtown. The food is quality, the price is right, and the people are very friendly. Can't beat it.

Normally go with a chicken combo (2 grilled chicken skewers + rice + fresh salad) with hot sauce on the side, but lots of good Mediterranean (including vegetarian) options on the menu."}
{"text":"I love Kabob house.  The falafel wrap is the best, and the customer service is quick, but really nice.  A great sandwich at a great price."}
{"text":"Fried cauliflower wrap sandwich for lunch? Yes, please. Super fresh, sweet friendly owners, what a little gem. Oh - and it was all of $3.50."}
{"text":"Delicious food and generous portions- the $6 falafel platter is the best and cheapest vegan lunch I've had downtown. The falafel is light as a feather and green inside because they make their own using fresh herbs. The cauliflower side is also amazing when I want something different. Every time I go, I see the same three friendly people working, I love supporting this local business."}
{"text":"I did not set out to write a bad review.  I have great respect for a small business trying to make their way in the world.  PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE POSTING

Positive:

Food:  The food was on par with a decent meal at a regular restaurant.

Service:  Initially good

Negative:

Price: Double the price of a meal of this style and type.  I did use the yelp coupon and only paid what the meal was actually worth.  It was not worth the original 18 dollars charged.

Coupon:  The establishment tried to tell me that the coupon was not good but they would accept it anyways.  This is after I asked when I first got to the restaurant.  Even if the coupon was not being used any more, yelp guarantees it for 1 year.

Atmosphere:  As usual this restaurant is empty, however on a Friday night we were there when they were setting up for an event on Saturday.  Evidently someone rented out the building for the next day.  They were playing really explicit rap videos on the projector while I had a 7 year old and 1 year old at the restaurant with me.  Not the Establishment per say, but the people setting up for the next day. 

Bathrooms:  Looked like they were under construction of some sort

Waitress:  Our food was served with rice and meat.  We asked if they had any sauces for the rice, the answer was no.  We asked for mayonnaise, the answer this time was that all the people that eat at this restaurant don't ask for things because there is spices (saffron) already in the rice. (as my wife always uses saffron, the amount of saffron was not worth mentioning) I would completely understand this if there were people in the restaurant  eating but it would seem that the one or two customers they get are for the Hookahs.  This means, maybe they should be open to change instead of telling me what the other people who aren't there eat.

Extra charges:  The food came with bread butter and feta cheese.  They asked if we want some more bread and we said yes.  They charged us on the bill an additional 4 dollars without telling us.

Kids menu:  None:  They said there is so much food, that kids eat from their parents.  However, if i let my 7 year old do this, I would not have any food for myself.

Air conditioning;  The air was shut off allowing the entire place to be filled with the smoke from the Hookahs.  However, when we were there no one showed up and no one was smoking a hookah until we left.

Note to other people posting reviews:  Please do not post racist comments about restaurants or cultures you do not know or understand.  After seeing the other comments which seemed racist, I did give the restaurant a try.  There are many restaurants in town that serve this kind of food with better reviews, and they are no different than anyone else.

Note to the owner:  If your restaurant improves these items listed, I would be happy to retract my review, but I would recommend lowering prices. People in Charlotte expect more if you are charging them that amount.  Please don't have your waitress tell me what other people eat there when you have no customers."}
{"text":"A delicious, quick, and filling lunch for $6.95 makes Kabob House a part of my weekly lunch lineup. On top of that, the owners are so nice and friendly. I highly recommend. Just make sure you have cash to avoid atm fees because they do not accept credit card."}
{"text":"Great food and an amazing hookah lounge the only place packed and fun during the weekends definitely worth going to"}
{"text":"The Kabob House offers various Mediterranean type foods all made fresh to order. I frequent this restaurant for lunch at least once or twice a week. Most items range between 4 and 5 dollars and are worth the price. I recommend the falafel sandwich. It's priced at $4.50 and very filling. They also offer various types of kabobs, sandwiches, hummus, and tabouli to name a few. This restaurant is great for lunch, and everything is cooked to order and very quick. This is a family owned place, and it's obvious the owners put a lot of love and care in their food and always very friendly service with a smile!"}
{"text":"We were the only people in the entire place. Service was okay, I'm pretty sure he was the owner. The food was decent, but the hookah was overpriced. The decor was unusual and everything could have used a good cleaning and a coat of paint. I won't be back to Kabob House."}
{"text":"The Food was very delicious and it was a nice and calm place with great hookahs"}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch spot downtown. The food is excellent and the people are really friendly. They are always smiling and it is obvious that they value your business which is rare for a downtown fast lunch experience (the food is too good to call it fast food).  I normally go with the chicken kabob which is a couple skewers of chicken put on a pita with some other things including a pickle and some type of sauce. At $5.50, the price is also great."}
{"text":"This place was garbage for hookah.  They didn't even change the water and there was ash inside the hose.  Definitely avoid like the plague if you want to keep your lungs fungus free."}
{"text":"Great local family-run business with fresh and delicious food. I stop here once in awhile for lunch, and I always get the chicken kabob meal. The grilled kabobs come served over rice, but I ask for salad in the large part of the to go container, with hummus and rice in the small compartments. The salad is so good, and you also get a side of pita bread. Very flavorful lunch option.

Overall: friendly service, good prices and good food. 

Tip: make sure you bring cash or your ATM card (there's one right there), as it's cash only!"}
{"text":"I came here one night to see a DJ play. It's an interesting place in a rather blah location. The parking lot is torn up, it's not easy to get to and it's kind of run down inside. The hookah gets overwhelming for me, but there are plenty of couches/chairs in the back. The DJ was good given what he had to work with and he got people dancing. So all of that does not equal 3 stars. What does jump it up to 3 starts is the food. The kabobs were amazing melt in your mouth. They were out of chicken so we got steak and definitely good food. The hummus was good as well. Overall due to location I probably wouldn't come back unless someone really wanted to go, however if you are in the area or live near there definitely give the food a try as it's really good."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times in the past, but never got around to posting a review.  I ventured here on yesterday for lunch, looking for something fresh & light.   I opted for the hummus wrap with a side of tabouli.  First of all you can't beat the prices here.  My hummus wrap was  $3 and the generous side of tabouli was only $2.75.  The wrap was perfect.   The pita bread was soft and fresh, the veggies (lettuce, tomatoes etc), were cool and fresh and the hummus was creamy and garlicky, just they way that I like it.   The tabouli was very fresh, but just ok, way too many onions for me.  All in all this was a good meal, especially for the low, low price of $5.75!"}
{"text":"This place is also called the Kabob House. 

Basically its a nice restaurant interior with one guy working as hostess, waiter, and a cook.  The place was clean and pleasant but the food was lacking.  

For the price of $15-22 you get one kabob of meat (7-8 inch by inch cubes), plain rice, and one tomato slice. i thought the food was not bad although my two friends did not like it(keep in mind they were middle eastern). it just wasnt enough food for the price. 

I can get past the slow service, but paying that much for so little was a huge disappointment especially after seeing very high marks for this place on citysearch."}
{"text":"Beef Kabob gets an easy FIVE Stars!!!  Persian Hot Tea, five stars!!! The Eggplant Dish was very good! The Belly Dancing gets Five stars!!!  Service also gets five stars!

From there everything else was Good though none of it was better than three stars and not as flavorful as I hoped, still good!

I'm the Only Dude here!  Eleven Female patrons including my Bride... add two Belly Dancers and our Waitress, I'm out numbered 14 to  1 !!!!!!  Great show!  If you have never seen live Belly Dancing it is Usually Entertaining and though maybe initially awkward it is fun!

Persian Ice Cream nice flavor combination of Pistachio, Rose Water and Saffron less dense than Kulfi - If I had never eaten (Indian Kulfi) I would have probably rated this Ice Cream Higher!

Baklava a bit disappointing, papery filo, though drier than the overly syrupy version"}
{"text":"Stopped by here to get a chicken kabob and it was delicious. The seasoning was great, it was cooked perfectly and was very reasonably priced. Both people working were super nice too. I would definitely come back and try more!"}
{"text":"Best lunch downtown!!! Falafel is always fresh. Can't go wrong with the rice, cauliflower or fattoush either. Could eat there everyday and almost do. The family that owns it brings not only great food, but incredible kindness to the city as well."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and very reasonable prices!  I'm a fan of the falafel sandwich and add a side of mujadara.  The whole thing comes to $6, which is rediculous for the large portions they give you.  

And ... like all of the great little places in Cleveland, this is only open for lunch.  Shame."}
{"text":"Great food, fantastic atmosphere and decor.  I stuck to the non meat dishes, and while there isn't a large selection vegetarian options, they'll occasionally  offer a veggie-kabob on request.  The appetizers include standard fare of cucumber salads, stuffed grape leaves, and roasted eggplant spreads (all exceptional in taste).  The badenjanin in particular is perfectly tart and spicy, but may not be for everyone.  Other than the food, their tea selections are great-- try the spiced chai.
My experience on weekend nights has been a full house with a mix of family groups at the tables, and college-age groups enjoying hookah in the pillow clad booths of the tea area.  Some nights feature a belly dancer and middle eastern music.  It fits in well with the decorated interior that's covered in arches an paintings (some on animal skins).  Service has been great 2/3 visits, with attentive and friendly staff open to offering suggestions, and an owner who spends time talking with the various groups.  On one very busy night, service was super slow, but the staff was still friendly and the delicious hookahs kept things calm.  Overall, this kind of place is rare in Charlotte and is worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Food is on point! I could eat here and everyday, and since I work downtown... I practically do! I adore everyone who works there, they are so friendly and I always walk away in a good mood. Every single thing I've ever ordered has been awesome. My go-to is the chicken kabob combo (2 grilled chicken kabobs, side of fattoush salad, delicious rice - not sure what kind) with all salad (substitute the rice for more salad) with cucumber sauce on the side. They also have a side of garlic sauce that you can ask for... their garlic sauce is no joke, it's so good, but warning: you will be breathing garlic for the rest of the day. Sometimes it's worth it. :)

The fattoush is super simple but always delicious fresh crispy lettuce and tomatoes and I'm in love with the dressing. One of these days I need to see if they'll give me the recipe. I have a feeling that it might just be lemon & olive oil... it's perfect and refreshing. 

Their humous is some of my favorite that I've ever had and the baklava is heavenly. 

No frills. Food counter located in the 5th street arcade. I usually get it to go and bring it back to my office - but the 5th street arcade is a nice place to grab a table for lunch because there is so much natural light and cool atmosphere with tons of little shops. 

Cash only."}
{"text":"We had an okay experience. The music was just my taste for the most part. I had a piña colada that wasn't great but it was strong. My biggest complaint is the weird seating. It felt like cement blocks they draped in carpets. It had us wondering how exactly do they keep those carpet seats clean. Not the best experience but it was cheap and open late."}
{"text":"Excellent Middle Eastern food, the best downtown. I've been searching for good Mediterranean food in the city for lunch and kept getting disappointed. I held off on trying this place way too long because it's cash only. But the prices are amazing, the portions are great, and the service is quick and friendly. I get their falafel combo at least once a week now!"}
{"text":"This place used to be an acceptable place. We visited during 2016 holidays. First of all, there was an offer on Yelp, 20 for 40. Absolute sham! There is a sign on the door: no coupons acceptable! I believe they use it just to attract customers."}
{"text":"It's not hard to get a satisfying and healthy lunch here for around $5. It's even less if you just want to snack on a spinach pie or two. Their falafel may not be Maha's (my benchmark for fried chickpea excellence), but it's quite good and very inexpensive. They make orders fresh and fast. It's a very nice option to have downtown."}
{"text":"I'm glad that someone else mentioned that this was known as the Kabob House, because if they didn't, I'd never have found it.  I don't know that I've ever seen it called Khaneh Kabob (though perhaps that's what it says in their native tongue).

Anyway - the place is indeed clean, though in an odd twist, it's attached to a beverage store.  That's not bad, just a statement of fact.  If you order a kabob that contains steak or chicken, I can definitely see how you might be disappointed - you don't get a lot.

If you order a kabob that has ground meat, you'll probably have leftovers.  Unfortunately, I can't tell you which kind to order, because we always go with our friends who do the ordering for us, but I can definitely tell you that these are not your typical Americanized shish-kabobs.  These are Persian-style kabobs.  So don't be disappointed.

The ground-beef-style ones are wrapped around a long, flat skewer and cooked on the skewer, and you get a ton of meat.  I don't know if you have to order side dishes separately, but we always get them - rice, bread and other items - because the meat by itself is good, but you'll want to have other items as well, because it makes it so much better.

Service is friendly, but it isn't speedy, and they have not historically been able to communicate particularly well in English."}
{"text":"I wish this place was open longer!  Other than their hours (10:30 am-3pm), this is one of the BEST middle eastern places not just in downtown Cleveland but around Cuyahoga County!  Affordable prices, GREAT food and nestled inside a nice little area on Euclid.  I can't wait to see what else is available and try something else next time."}
{"text":"Most amazing food at the best prices!! The people that work there are just the nicest and so welcoming, its a place id definitely come back too"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite place to eat downtown! The food is fresh, authentic and served with a smile. I like to keep the grilled kabob (made right in front of you) over all salad. The greens are fresh, crisp and the dressing is to die for. It's tangy with the right amount of salt. My favorite part of eating here is how affordable it is! Love this place!"}
{"text":"It's little.  It's unassuming.  It's got pictures of hummous on the walls.  

Kabob House is a little takeout stand that has the usual lineup of popular Middle Eastern specialties-- steak kabobs, chicken kabobs, kifta, falafel, hummous, baba, spinach pies, lentil soup.  What keeps me going back is the ultra fresh ingredients and the preparation on a real grill.

I had the kifta combo today-- kifta (ground beef with onions, parsley, tomatoes and spices mixed in, then grilled), rice pilaf and a salad.  The kifta was brightly flavorful and juicy-  my only complaint is that it was a bit salty.  It was accompnied by a skewer of freshly grilled tomatoes and onions.  The pilaf had a nice toasty, buttery flavor, but was not greasy in the least.  The salad was a simple lettuce, tomato and cucumber mix, lightly dressed with olive oil and lemon juice and topped with pita chips.  (Not traditional fattoush-- no sumac--but good).  The veggies were all astonishingly fresh.

I've had the steak and chicken kabobs before-- both fresh and juicy.  They marinate all their meat, so it's got a great, complex flavor.  NB: they are liberal with the onions.  Buy Altoids if you have a meeting.  

The people who run the place are really nice and accomodating-- you can mix and match your meats in the combo if you feel like it or ask for more salad and no rice!  The proprietress and I chat about mujadarah recipes.  One can never be too well versed in the art of mujadarah."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place for lunch whenever I am actually carrying cash. I am obsessed with the falafel plate! It includes 3 pieces of really delicious, crispy on the outside, moist on the inside falafels, really delicious rice and a crisp salad. When I get this, I also request both a cucumber and a garlic sauce, pour both all over my salad and rice and mix it together. 

By the way, this is all about $6.

If I have the good fortune of having sriracha on hand, even better!

The lady who takes your order is probably the nicest person in Cleveland, if not the world! Such a sweetheart, and never in a bad mood, even when they are really busy. 

Love this place!"}
{"text":"It's located on the south side of the connection between the Colonial Arcade (to the east) and the Euclid (or 5th St) Arcade (to the west); it's closer to the 5th St Arcade side. 

They only accept cash. There is an ATM right next to the restaurant. The lady behind the counter is very friendly and directs newcomers on the menu. 

The portions are large in terms of the combo plates. I got the chicken kabob combo. You get 2 grilled kabobs (chicken and - a few - onion slices) over a bed of rice that fills half the plate. The meat is grilled fresh to order and you can watch it cook. The other half of the plate is salad, which had a lot of dressing on it to the point that it was puddling in the bottom of the plate. There was also 1 large pita provided. They also offer a quarter sized container of sauce to go with your lunch - I got the garlic sauce. I got a side of hummus which was really good and thick."}
{"text":"Best arabic food around hands down! The owners are such great and friendly people! Fresh food and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"CONSISTENTLY good! the owners/employees are SO friendly! The food is always delicious and fresh. Today was my most recent visit. I got my usual - the falafel sandwich with hot sauce - and then decided to try the spinach pie. I tend to always forget that a spinach pie is not always the same as a spinach feta pie, and I don't generally like the plain, tart spinach pies at most middle eastern places, so I wasn't a fan. But, that's just my own personal taste / mistake. The falafel balls were super fresh and moist, and the toppings were perfect - lettuce, tomato, white tahini sauce, tangy and spicy hot sauce, and pickle. The pita was soft and chewy as usual. SUPER tasty

Anyways, this time I got the falafel, spinach pie, a bottle of water, and a bottle of snapple peach tea.... ALL FOR $8.00 .... Worth it?? I think so!!!"}
