{"text":"When we first walked in, i think we all agreed it smelled a little funky; to the point of joking about getting up and going elsewhere. Two of us got the teriyaki chicken and it was compared to a salsbury steak sauce on rice. The volcano roll fell apart, but it tasted alright. The fried rice was terrible and heavily coated with something I'm not used to. The staff was nice though!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. Best sushi I ever had. Friendly staff and engaged owners. I will be back. Tomorrow!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was empty an hour after the football game. This is a bad sign. We waited 30 min for our food. Our food was cold. One member of our party did not receive his meal with the remainder of the group. When the group complained the server said \"the cook is new and is messing everything up.\"  We paid for our drinks and left. Worst service ever. Horrible food. Several other parties walked out as well. Do not waste your time. Walk across the street to Gordon Biersch."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today as my usual sushi joint next store was closed down(BUMMER). I was not impressed the sushi was not up to par and the fish didn't seem fresh, I also ordered the chicken teriyaki and was brought beef instead no big deal. It tasted as if it was warmed in the microwave and the rice was hard. I was eager to try this place due some positive reviews, we must have went on an off day. Needless to say we will not be returning, I advise you save your money and try something new from the westgate community!!!"}
{"text":"This is a sad attempt. The service is poor and the food is mediocre. A bad way to spend $80.00. This is a place for people who doesn't know what sushi is. Everyone who knows what a proper sushi looks and taste like will say the same thing. At least invest the time to make your food look and taste good if you have the arrogance to fusion two types of cuisine."}
{"text":"This place is awful, and at multiple things.  On the specific night we went, the service was slow and there were only two tables being waited on that night. The bartender was more worried about flirting with some girl then serving others at the bar.  There guac is soo...... bad. Funny, when we ordered the guac, our waiter walked up and gave us a cup of it with three spoons.  When we asked for chips, the waiter said they were out.  Long behold the bartender screams, \"no I found some\".  As it turns out, he found a bag of tostitos.  The sushi rolls were good awful, drenched in sauce to hide the bad flavor of the old fish and the beer was flat.  Safe to say that this restaurant ruined the excitement of a Mexican-sushi fusion."}
{"text":"Went in today for the first time nice atmosphere, a lot of my friends recommended this place to me so me and a friend came to give it a try we ordered a guamuchilito and a kamikaze roll they were amazing gotta say this place is now one of my top favorite sushi spots on the west side everything was fresh and made as you order. If your looking for something different and best of both worlds this is the place."}
{"text":"Came here just by chance and it was great I had the cielo mar y tierra roll and my wife had the tres quesos roll.  Service was great and we will be back again."}
{"text":"I love their Mexican it has one hell of a kick but its soo good!!! The portions are huge and the price is great! They have awsome service! I didn't find one thing about this place I didn't like!! My new sushi go to spot!!"}
{"text":"The food was good and decent atmosphere but had to wait horribly long (over 45 minutes) to get 4 rolls. It wasn't very busy either. It looked like they chose to do a pick up order rather than finish our order. Showed bad customer service choice to us."}
{"text":"Use to be a small business fan of this place but our waitress(salene) was too busy flirting with the other customers to help us. The owner is related to her so our complaint went unresolved.  I've spent too much money there to be treated so disrespectfully.  Will never go back!"}
{"text":"This place gets better and better each time I go.. Now it only did they remodel but their service is always great as well"}
{"text":"Sushi was on point.  So good. Service was great. Staff was very friendly.  Clean. Will most definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Had lunch and I left without my card. Not sure if I forgot it or the server deliberately did not return it.  Either way a few hours later there were multiple attempts to fraudulently use my card. There were only 2 other occupied tables, an older couple and a family with 2 toddlers.  Obviously an employee was in on the theft. I am reporting them to the Better Business Bureau. I will never go back. The Manager did return my call but the damage was already done."}
{"text":"After reviewing all the reviews I was hesitant to come here but I figured let's give it a shot as I believe in small business. A hidden gem. Even anongst chain restaurants this kind of sushi is its own style and it's just about the same as the normal sushi joints out there. Food was amazing. Fresh and flavorful Service: 5 stars. There were about 5 servers on the floor and they were all attentive to guests needs. The space still needs its personal style but hey you go to a restaurant for the food. This place didn't disappoint. Attached is the roll I had. The culicuhi roll.   We also had micheladas. Both flavorful. Forget about the past reviews this place is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow and the rolls ordered made up for it.  We were hesitant to order sushi from a restaurant that also serves Mexican fusion sushi as well.  We ordered from the traditional menu and who knows, we might try their fusion menu."}
{"text":"The poison ivy roll is delicious!!! I got a strawberry mango margarita is to die forrrrr!!!!"}
{"text":"I took a chance on it thinking about a Mexican sushi joint but I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the Las Vegas roll, it was big and awesome. I also tried the carne asada burrito and it was really good too.  I got the wings as an appetizer and they were really good too. Patty was an awesome server and was very responsive to my needs.  If I'm ever back in the Phoenix area I'll be stopping back in. Good find."}
{"text":"The best place I've found in Arizona. The horchata so bomb you don't even need ice. The michelada makes you feel right at home. I recommend with negro modelo and the sushi is fire!!!"}
{"text":"I should have gone with a traditional roll. The  service was pleasant. The sushi maker was skilled. The ingredients were fresh. The plate looked great. The manager stepped in when things were backed up, checked on my dinner, and refilled my drink.  The problem- although well made and fresh, the sushi was confused. Japanese and Mexican cuisines are simple, which is not simple to do. A laundry list of ingredients melded into a roll where I couldn't pick out a flavor. I wanted to try the fusion. I had a good time. Next time, I'll do something simpler. Based on the effort they're putting in, it'll probably be better."}
{"text":"Saturday night at 9pm, not too busy. We were seated right away but sat there for fifteen minutes waiting for a server to greet us. Nothing. Got up and left. There were maybe four servers there standing around. Pretty disappointed as we were excited to try this place out.  Edit to add: came back the next day and food was worth the wait. Ordered two traditional rolls and two Mexican rolls and all were delicious."}
{"text":"The food is delicious the service is bad and hasn't changed since they opened. I recommend it if you dont mind waiting 45 minutes for your food!"}
{"text":"Super disappointing I actually liked this place I've gone like 4 times but yesterday that we went to have dinner we had to return food 3 different times because of how cold it this was not the first time. I just wanted to fue it one last try and sure enough COLD FOOD. Not coming back again."}
{"text":"Very good food.  The Traditional and Mexican rolls are very flavorful. The sauce you get on the side is perfect with the rolls. Our server was very pleasant and made really great suggestions. She was very attentive and kept our drinks full. Will be coming back, for sure."}
{"text":"First time EVER trying sushi, glad this was my first place! Delicious food, great service and very affordable."}
{"text":"Wow. Gross. I don't know if the food was any good because 90 seconds after the surly waitress served me a terrible margarita with a cockroach egg case garnish, I left. Mexican/Asian fusion is really hard to pull off but basic sanitation is not."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. Everything was pretty good. The carne esada roll was just alright though.  My major problem is that they make their rolls way to big. You can't fit one whole piece in your mouth a time. That goes against the main point of sushi. The service was excellent though."}
{"text":"What an experience! Let me start off by mentioning how cute the place is inside. The decor is really sheek and elegant with table cloths and big open windows. And then there's the food.... I got edamame, firecracker jalapeños and the mexican roll. I like spicy food and the sushi chef was more than happy to accommodate. He also told me he could do any traditional roll as well, but im not a traditional type of person so I went with a specialty roll. His roll was beautifully put together with a nice presentation. The firecracker jalapeños were excellent! Whole jalapeños cut in fourths and deep fried with cream cheese with a very nice sauce served on top (and not too much). On the side I was given an excellent mixed ponzu sauce that went great with everything!  My waiter was very attentive and pleasant! Not one complaint with the service! The owner was behind the bar and very friendly as well. Overall it was a great choice to eat!"}
{"text":"The best sushi ive had! I love getting the firecrackers and the guamuchilito. Dont come here unless you're willing to wait a very, very long time just for someone to notice you're waiting by the front door. Service is alright could use more staff."}
{"text":"The staff accommodated our large party without a problem after Kabuki had a 90 minute wait. Food was tasty and diverse. Wait staff wasn't all on the same page though,  TV was pretty loud with the soccer game on and the food came out in intervals. Bathrooms are tidy and restaurant has a cool vibe. Didn't rush us and was great at splitting the checks up front.  Very sweet to give a birthday treat."}
{"text":"We LOVE El Tataki Sushi and Mexican Grill.   Best sushi we've found in the west valley.   Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"While our food was delicious, I was very disappointed with the service. I ordered a mango margarita and when it came it was covered in spicy seasoning. I explained to the waitress that I just ordered a plain mango margarita and her solution was to get me a spoon to scrape the topping off. The topping had seeped all throughout the drink by this time so I told her I didn't want the drink. I had only had one sip of it to taste it. When we got our bill I was shocked to see we had been charged for the drink. I explained to the waitress that I didn't actually have the drink because it wasn't what I ordered and she said that's how they come and refused to take it off the bill. We will not be going back because of this incident."}
{"text":"I've tried many sushi places around the valley and I am confident to say that this is the best one I have been. The portions are big and if you order anything out of the tradional sushi menus you will find a great taste in every bite. I also liked the inside of the place, very laid back.   UNIQUE PLACE with excellent service.  TRY IT!!!!!"}
{"text":"For the prices, it really should've tasted better. Also, if you have a baby and you need to change him or her, plan on doing it somewhere else because there is no changing table. There was nowhere at all to change our baby. We had to change her in the front, where everybody walked in and saw. One of the things I ordered was shrimp fried rice. They literally put three pieces of shrimp in my fried rice. When I asked them about it, she said they put 7 pieces. I am telling you, there were not seven pieces. There were three pieces that were the size of my thumb. Just overall not a great experience. It wasn't bad food, but I will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"Not real happy with service here tonight. Didn't get our appetizer. Then they brought half the meals out and told us it would be 20 minutes for the rest of it. We decided if the meals were finished before the order was brought we would cancel it and eat at home. When we cancelled the order, the rest of it miraculously appeared.  Not sure that we will come back."}
{"text":"I went with my husband, his brother and wife and we were pretty disappointed. My husband ordered tacos, his brother ordered the teriyaki and me and my sister in law ordered a couple different plates of sushi. The guys got their food about 20 minutes later, but after another 40 minutes waiting for the sushi, we finally ordered the check and then found out it would have been another 20 minutes for the sushi. In all that time, we only received one refill of our drinks and had to flag someone down for that. It was ridiculous and had they provided upfront expectations, I probably would have ordered something else and not been so upset."}
{"text":"Whoa! My girlfriend and I  went for our first time. We got gyoza, cerveza, & a roll each (she got Guamuchilito & I picked El Sinaloco). We should have ordered one to split! So much food! O_O  Delicious it was! I figured the fusion would work, but we were both delightfully surprised! If you have not tried El Tataki, you are missing out! We will be returning for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Clean, wait staff very nice and efficient!  Yes there is a bad smell outside but I believe it is the grease traps from the greek place that closed next door. Doesn't smell bad inside! Food was fresh! !  Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Interesting concept for dining. Friendly waitress.  Fried sushi was interesting but good. Music nice touch but too loud for dinner atmosphere."}
{"text":"From the vibe of the place to the food I ate, good quality was not executed. The rolls were falling apart and the meals lacked authentic sushi taste. Although the place was open and nice, the \"Mexican\" sushi restaurant lacked the mixture of cultures expected.   +no hair nets"}
{"text":"Sitting in sauna kabuki waiting an hour & a half for a table I don't even need anymore. I think I lost 10 pounds sweating & the last of my Kirin Light is disgustingly hot. Not coming here again. Well maybe to see the sweat stain my ass left on my bar stool."}
{"text":"Well, I could write a long review based on our ridiculously long wait time for drinks (25 minutes/plus one wrong order), and then over an hour for food (actually, 3 at our table were served at the 50 minute mark, finished their meals, then rest of table served another 25 minutes later, plus 2 wrong orders lol!), and the staff lack of apology or even interest (server constantly on phone, sushi \"cooks\" eating food at side bar, etc.) in serving customers. Mind you, the place was empty! That should have been our first clue.  I can't say I have never been in a place this poorly run, may be a Denny's at 2am in the middle of New Mexico, but I can say I have never seen a place stay open for long if this is their best effort.   So many issues I can't possibly list them all.   So, in a word - Terrible!   If you go and have good service and food, play the lottery that night because you are very lucky!"}
{"text":"This place had TERRIBLE service and below mediocre food. I would NOT recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Was kinda nervous when we pulled up and there was only a few cars. It got busier as we were eating.   The music was a little too loud for us as we have children. But we still enjoyed it once we moved inside.  The food was delicious! My husband is usually anti-sushi but he actually ate almost half of mine and loved it. He got the nachos with beef, they were pretty good but for a Mexican place there was a lot of chips and not a lot of everything else.   The service was ok. Not bad at all, but nothing to rant and rave over.   Overall we really enjoyed it and will be back!"}
{"text":"Where to start. It was a party of 13 for us. Really looking forward to try it. First thing they said is the would not split the check.  That it was too complicated. Notice not impossible,  just complicated. We ordered our drinks.  Like 10 min for us to get them.  I only had water.  Or sushi took for ever to arrive.  At least 45 min. Sushi was over priced.  Medium to small portions so don't expect to get full with just one.  Service sub-par. They didn't refill my water once."}
{"text":"Really? Mexican and Japanese, does it get any better than this? Well the rolls were fantastic, a perfect mix of both worlds. I don't think you can really go wrong here, we just bought whatever sounded good, and it was! The service was great too. :)"}
{"text":"Worse service ever! As I'm sitting at bar the manager is drinking a beer right next to me with no elbow room for me and other servers just standing around talking at the bar table as I eat with no space, then a waitress spills a full cup of soda all over me and not one server gave me a towel to clean me up as they watch me soaking and rather clean the floor, didn't even offer a discount or anything to show respect towards a customer , the food is great but service sucks so bad !!!! Disappointed !"}
{"text":"this is the first time I tried this restaurant as well as Mexican sushi I wasn't sure if it would taste good. The presentation was beautiful but it was kind of weird. I thought I might like it because I love Japanese sushi and I also love Mexican food so I thought maybe marriage of the two would be good but not for me. The service was wonderful."}
{"text":"If you're looking for big portions and small prices, El Tataki is the way to go. Most of the rolls are deep friend and drenched in sauce, but that's why they call it mexican sushi. It's not super high quality fish, and the flavor comes from the sauces not the actual sushi, but it's still absolutely delicious. Everyone should experience El Tataki at least once. Unfortunately they don't get a lot of customers (assumingly due to poor location) so some options on the menu like draft beer and guacamole have been indefinitely unavailable."}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday night with three co-workers, and ordered the cielo, tierra, y mar (sky, land, and sea). Overall, I found the sushi to be okay; the Mexican-Japanese fusion was definitely an interesting concept, and I had personally never had beef in sushi before. The portions are very generous, service took longer than expected.   Bottom line: Interesting Mexican-Japanese fusion place, glad I got to try it."}
{"text":"So we went to kabuki and the wait was an hour and a half no way we're we waiting that long for okay sushi so I told the fellas let's try this new spot next to the outlets and omg thank goodness we did we each ordered a roll and asked the waiter what she might recommend and her recommendations were on point also ordered a small chicken fried rice and there was nothing small about it this place is awesome I can't find anything wrong with it very clean and the our waiter was on top of things she was very helpfull"}
{"text":"I was excited to try a sushi fusion. This place  did not disappoint! The service, food, and ambiance was great! We had the jalapeño poppers which were delicious, much bigger and more filling than other places. They also gave us some sort of tangy soy sauce with chile powder in it. Made the sushi taste even better especially the carne asada roll. We also had the volcano roll which was good but not as good as the other food. My 1 and 2 yr olds shared some fried rice and loved it."}
{"text":"Food was OK service was extra slow. Took 30 minutes to our food and it was only two of us in the whole restaurant. They are very stingy with their avocado."}
{"text":"Very disappointing!  The concept is exciting, Mexican and sushi fusion, but the reality was awful. We were hopeful with the menu describing excellent Mexican sushi rolls, however the two we got looked the same and tasted the same. We expected a spicy bite, but got nothing but bland flavor. The service was unacceptable. There were only three tables occupied, and we waited over 35 minutes for 3 of the 4 dishes. We had to wait another 15-20 for the last dish to arrive. We had to ask for silverware, we had to take our glass to the bar to get it refilled with water. Our waitress did not chk on us one time!  The mgr did take the burrito off the bill, but it was too little too late. We will not return."}
{"text":"Lady there was so rude and got my order wrong and didn't fix it, first and last time I go here, waste of money"}
{"text":"Called in to place an order for pick up. The rep answered and told me to hold on because she had people coming in. As I work in customer service I understood and told her it was fine that I could hold. After holding I told her what I wanted to order and she put me on hold again to check at what time it could be ready. After she told me over 45 min I told her to not put my order in since I was hoping less waiting time. She than said \"so you don't want it?!\" Uh no just cause of her attitude."}
{"text":"Food is ok, service sucks or maybe they were just short staffed when I went but no greet at the door or anything, had to ask where we should sit like c'mon it wasn't even busy. As far as mexican sushi it was ok, I prefer Sushi Sonora. Don't think I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. If you get seated outside, you will be forgotten and wait 2 hours for 4 plates of food. The food taste like cardboard. We still left a $20 tip however we will NOT be coming back"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite sushi spot at the moment. It's amazing!!! They are pricy but worth it! All types of sushi, from traditional, Mexican style and on. I do have to say, they don't have spicy mayo and they charge for eel sauce and orange sauce .. only downfall. And they do take a long time to take your order and even bring it out. Other than that the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Been here twice both times waited more then 40 min, first time I thought it was because they had just opened that week, it's been months and hardly anyone in restaurant and still took over 40 min. Waited in the front area the whole time and didn't even get a drink offered or anything. My 8 yr old had to keep asking if it was almost ready. Food is good but not for that wait time."}
{"text":"Horrible service, mediocre sushi. Our food came out 1 plate every 10 minutes. Don't do it..."}
{"text":"I order a bomba from this place for the 3 time and it was cold inside i was very upset let the server know and she did nothing about the issue she said it was because the layer of rice was thick , that is not the costumers fault though its upsetting that there costumer service is so bad i dint even eat it and she charged me full price for it !!"}
{"text":"It's good Sushi if you want to add a Mexican spin to it. But omg the service sucks, your gonna wait to be seated even though there's hardly any people & wait on your waitress. But sushi is different, rolls are big and good food."}
{"text":"Originally I was headed to My Big Fat Greek Restaurant but it closed down. But next door was a Mexican Asian Sushi fusion joint. I thought, ok, what the hell. So glad I gave it a try. It was so good! They have traditional sushi rolls but you can get those anytime. So, I tried the Mexican sushi rolls and the portions are huge. I tried the Firecracker Jalapeños. I was expecting some heat but it wasn't hot at all. So a little disappointed about that. Then for the Mexican sushi roll I chose the Guamuchilito and it had shrimp tempura, avocado, cucumber, crab, cream cheese and shrimp all deep fried. It was flippin' amazeballs!!"}
{"text":"Cool spot with good food and service. The lemon roll was amazing. Ohh and the Michilada was frickin awesome"}
{"text":"So I sit down and get an ice cold dos xx to get started after a stressed out day. My day was already getting better. The miso soup was delicious, The bartender recommends a roll called \"limon roll\" and it was like he knew my taste buds. AMAZING!!!!!!! This roll didn't need Anything else, no soy, no sauce, no nothing. I get another beer, drink a glass of water, and I was on my way. Good experience I recommend this place to anyone that likes sushi or Mexican food (the tacos looked good) lol"}
{"text":"Interesting concept.  Had the Shrimp Killer roll and Carne Asada roll.  Good, attentive and friendly service.  Shrimp roll was fine, a tad too much sauce, overpowered the well-crafted roll but tasty.  The deep fried Carne Asada roll tasted good except for the fact the meat in just about every bite was gristly, very disappointing."}
{"text":"I'll start this off with saying the food was better than I expected. I tried the el crabby and it was filling. If you get a speciality roll, just get one you won't finish more than that. They try very hard with the presentation as well.   The reason for the low stars was service. It was fairly slow, and the it was early afternoon on a friday, not very crowded. I can forgive that, maybe they were short staffed in the kitchen. My issue is that the server actively ignored me. He would constantly ask my friend if he wanted a refill on his still 3/4ths full soda but would never offer to refill my water even if it was nearly empty. I eventually had to ask for a refill more than once.   In addition to that, when it came time to get the check, we asked if we could split it down the middle. He told us not a problem and brings us the ipad. The check isn't split. Thinking we have to do it, we examine the ipad a bit and can't figure it out. So we call him over to do it. He does it, sets it up for one of us and walks away. So we are left to figure out how to pay the rest of the check on my friend's card. Which we eventually do, but this is a terrible way to set it up. We are young people and fairly tech savvy. If we couldn't figure it out for five minutes, I'm willing to bet it would be much harder for other people."}
{"text":"El Tataki is my new favorite Sushi/Mexican infusion restaurant! I love the the music, people are awesome and fun, food is outstanding! Need a cool place to go hangout....this is your place!"}
{"text":"When this place first opened it was pretty good sushi wise. However, as time went on we noticed their service was totally different. Tonight I ordered to-go and realized that they screwed up one of our order. I did not want to be that person that calls to complain but I did not want to pay for something that I was not going to eat. I ended up calling and asked if I could possibly swap out my wrong order for the correct one. They said yes. I drove back and they did not even say sorry for getting my order wrong. Not to mention, employees who work at the mall near by no longer get a discount there. They rudely told us that discount did not exist anymore. It was just a question. Safe to say my co-workers and i will no longer be getting food from there anymore. This is not the only time we have got this type of service either. It seems they are ALWAYS blaming the cooks for something."}
{"text":"Never had Mexican sushi so I tried this place out with friends. I got the Mexican roll with some appetizers. The apps were pretty good and decently priced. The roll was good too. Nothing really blew my mind. But I did for full for under $20. It's was overall okay."}
{"text":"It was exactly what the rating says.  A-OK. Let me start with the amazing, raw sewage smell that was on he walk into the restaurant.  It may not be their fault, but it hurt the experience.   Atmosphere, just reminded me of a chain restaurant.  The service was eh.  They actually forgot someone's order.  It was not even busy when we went in.  I was not a huge fan of the food, but my friends were.  It seemed to be well prepared, but definitely not for my palate.  All in all, fun to try but I will not be back."}
{"text":"Too long in between dishes. Sushi is o.k so so, nothing yo run home and tell mama about."}
{"text":"My two friends and I are big sushi fans. I have to admit we were skeptical about a Mexican Sushi place. Well, the rolls were very good, very fresh, and well made. We each ordered a couple rolls and shared, all of them were really good. We also tried the Mexican food, a taco and a burrito and both were very good. The carne asada was awesome and our waitress suggested the adobado sauce on the carne asada. It was darn good.  Our waitress Selena was very friendly and provided excellent service. We are really looking forward to going back.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"This place has a great concept. You can get a burrito and a sushi roll in one stop. The food was good and the waiter was attentive and nice. I wish they had some type of happy hour menu for lunch or something and they need to get horchata!"}
{"text":"Something Different   We were interested in trying El Tataki Sushi and Mexican Grill.  After all Mexican/Sushi are two foods I really enjoy, maybe this fusion of my two favorite foods will be delicious.   El Tataki restaurant is a nice size and seating was well spaced.  The servers were pleasant and I enjoyed some Blue Moon while we waited for our dishes.    The rolls we ordered were huge and 3 were shared by 3 people with leftovers.  We shared spicy salmon roll, Crunchy roll, and lemon roll. A crunchy and Lemmon rolls were not my favorite however, the spicy salmon was decent.  For dessert we ordered some fried ice cream and it tasted pretty good.  The food in my opinion  was just kind of average.  I'll probably visit  again sometime soon and try different entrees."}
{"text":"Restaurant was completely empty... My party of 3 was the only table. Our drinks too a very long time. The bar promotes various beers, all of which were out if stock (probably shouldn't advertise).  While I didn't have the sushi, the street tacos were mediocre."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!!! We ordered a total of three dishes, after 15 min our first dish came. We finish the first dish and waited 37 minute for the rest of the food that never came. We will never return and we will tell all of our friends to never come to this place!!!. If you are hungry don't come to this place!!! Everybody waited at least 20 minutes and the food come one dish at a time."}
{"text":"This is definitely NOT the best sushi in town! Extremely disappointed! Thought it would be a fun twist to the traditional style but it wasn't. It took SO long to get our food and it wasn't all that busy. We ended up asking for our last roll to be boxed before it even made it to our table. Definitely won't be coming back. Sadly we took the waiters recommendations on our rolls which you'd think you get 1 good roll out of 5 but unfortunately that we're all bland and nothing I'd ever order again."}
{"text":"I usually only get sushi at Ah So and this was just as good as them! The rolls were really big and the crab was very fresh! Really enjoyed the rolls!! The only thing was our waiter didn't check on us so we all ran out of drinks and there was no designated hostess so there was a line."}
{"text":"Our server had no idea what the special were.  Food was ok but not memorable and not worth the price.  Skip this place - there are too many great places to eat in Arizona to waste time on a place like this."}
{"text":"Best fusion sushi ever! Everything was delicious definitely worth a try if you love sushi and you love Mexican. Best of both"}
{"text":"Was intrigued by the Sushi-Mex fusion and decided to give it a try while planning a trip to the outlet mall only to discover when we got there that they were closed with a sign in the window indicating that they were participating in an immigrant walkout.  You know what, you can have whatever political beliefs you like. That's called freedom. So I guess you're also free to close your restaurant whenever you want and for whatever reason you want. But know that you had a patron walking up to your door ready to give you business and was instead turned away because of your political beliefs.   I too have freedom. I don't have to give my hard-earned money to those who want to throw their politics in my face. Instead I went to a restaurant that decided to respect me and my very reasonable expectations of exchanging my money for their offerings during their usual business hours without any stress or friction one way or the other.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"There are two Mexican sushi places I want to try and this was one of them. The decor inside the restaurant seems nice and our waitress was punctual. We ordered the Mexican roll, Milena roll and some calamari tempura.  The calamari was ok. The Milena roll and Mexican roll were really good. The Mexican roll has some spice to it. The Milena roll was very filling because first, it was breaded and deep fried. Second, it had avocado, bacon, chicken and shrimp among other vegetables. I loved the sauce. It was a tangy spicy mayo.  The price is above $10 for each roll so be prepared for that. I will try the other place soon and see how that goes as well. But for now, if you are in West Gate area and want some Mexican sushi, head on over there. Or traditional sushi rolls... we didn't order those, but they are also there if you want to order them."}
{"text":"Good sushi, tastes fresh, big rolls :) don't come if you're a hurry. maybe more kitchen staff"}
{"text":"I really like the food.  But service is lacking...if I go back I'll just do to go order."}
{"text":"Ate here about a month or so ago. I greatly disliked it. Very pricy. you do get alot of food but it's all poor quality. I had the Yaki soba which tasted like the instant version you could buy at any grocery store for a buck (the dish here I believe is 12 dollars) a friend had ordered 2 rolls which took Forever to arrive to the table. they weren't very good either. I won't be returning. as a matter of fact everytime me and my boyfriend pass by this restaurant he jokingly tells me \"I'm going to take you there for every special occasion\" knowing very well I cringe at the thought. Just keep driving people you aren't missing much"}
{"text":"Desperately searching Yelp for something in walking distance of bike night, (which was lame, btw) saw a pic of the firecracker jalapeños and gave it a try. They were \"ok\" compared to other places I've had them, for some reason they lacked heat. (-Spicy heat) Chicken fried rice was average and had frozen bag veggies in it. Husband's California roll was grocery store quality which I guess was alright by him :/ I ordered one carne asada taco. It was meat only...meat flavor was good. The meat was luke warm. This place had one waitress on a Thursday eve. She brought our food out one plate at a time, several mins apart, kinda weird. Husband was ready for a refill by the time each plate was brought out. She never asked us how the food was, did we need anything, etc...we had to ask for our check and a box. This place would satisfy the average hungry dude going to the area for sports events."}
{"text":"I got there saw couple families waiting so i just went straight to the bar, thinking self sitting like everywhere else......it's the first place they tell me i can't sit at the bar until they sit everyone else....... I asked if some of the people waiting will sit at the bar so i can move and totally understand, she said : no one is sitting here but you cant be here until i clean my tables and sit the rest of the people....it was so stupid, but o well just got up and left... Too bad that restaurants with good food have  such a bad service.... Or untrain staff."}
{"text":"Saturday night. I was excited to give it a shot, and as it turned out the food was pretty good. I'm actually eating my leftover fried rice as I write this.   We ordered nachos for an appetizer, two rolls(pretty tasty, too much sauce on the kamikaze), two small fried rice sides(solid portion size). The food was good. No problems there.   But the service. Man. I can't think of a worse experience. Only one server on the floor, and he should have been a bus boy at best. Managers nowhere to be seen. It took an hour to get the second roll after about 45 minutes to get the first. The waiter \"forgot to write it down\" and when he took our order the first time. They sent 2 of the same rolls out that we had ordered to \"his sisters table\" after he re-entered our order, even though we watched them come in at least half an hour after us. It was comically poor service.   I hope management reads the reviews. The service was just so bad I don't really know what to say. You won't last much longer if that's how you run your business."}
{"text":"Had lunch, We tried the sushi and a teriyaki bowl. The food was very good however wish they put more chicken on the bowl it was supposed to be a large and it looked kinda small, It was worth the $9 flavor wise. The staff was very friendly and attentive. We got the \" Greñudo sushi it was awesome, love the Mexican twist to the roll...Definitely going back! The ambiance was fun, Kids menu is adorable."}
{"text":"Never coming back ever again. Horrible horrible service. We had like four different servers. My gf's food came out and my bfs food came out like thirty minutes later so my food got cold. Don't recxomend this place at all."}
{"text":"Good sushi, creative menu, friendly wait staff.  Decor is nice.  It's on the edge of west gate so easy parking.  Have many of the traditional rolls as well as a mexican twist on some"}
{"text":"I guess the idea of culinary fusion is a trend and when done right, it might just work! The effort is certainly there. In all fairness the food is okay, there are some good choices and the prices are a little high, but not excessive. My problem is the service, the servers are plain rude, inexperienced and dismissive to the customers needs. I strongly believe this is a serious management issue that has not been resolved. Clearly no training, complete disregard to the expectations of any dining experience. Ironically the place is full, certainly a lack of gratitude to the patrons!"}
{"text":"I don't want to completely slam them but I did not feel that I was treated fairly regarding a black hair that was found in my Guamuchilito. I don't have black hair and neither does anyone in my family. I showed the waitress and she asked if I wanted a different roll but I explained that we were at the end of our meal. I was expecting them to take the entire price of the hair ridden roll off of my bill but I was not even given 50% off of my roll. Unfair, gross and ridiculous. Never again. Their food tasted good but was a bit pricey and their customer service is lacking."}
{"text":"Came here tonight with some friends and so glad we did! It wasn't a busy night for them, I don't know if it's just because it's a weekday or in a bad location.   But anyways, service was great the entire time we were there. No complaints at all, and thanks to our waiter for being so patient and giving us recommendations. We got 5 rolls for 5 people and we were stuffed. Here's what we got: (I might have forgotten some names...)  Guamuchilito Roll- SO GOOD! Gila Monster Roll- Very good, too rich to eat the whole roll by yourself though Mileno Roll- Ehh...It's alright. Didn't know what I was eating really, and too cheesy Vegas Roll- SO GOOD! Mexican Roll- Good, a little spicey  The Vegas and Guamuchilito were my favorite tonight!!! MMM yummy rolls :)  Their credit card machines wasn't working, so they had to call it in, so it took a while for them to check us out, but we weren't in a hurry anyways. Also, it would be nice if they offer happy hour..I would go much more often! :)  I would definitely recommend this place! Go give it a try!"}
{"text":"My family had their doubts, but I managed to convince them to try fusion--given that we are both Japanese and Mexican.  At first the service was slow: the restaurant seemed empty, the food hadn't come out, hardly anyone was visible in the kitchen...it didn't look good.  But as soon as the food began to come out, we were amazed at the development of flavors and special flair in every dish that made it fusion. Even dishes that weren't specifically advertised on the \"fusion\" part of the menu.  I come to Phoenix from LA to visit family every year and would definitely come back to El Tataki. However, be wary that service could be a while--but I assure you that it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"I love this place. Rock 'n Roll is our favorite sushi roll and the sashimi salad is out of this world and those two alone are worth 5 stars in my opinion. Some of the other rolls don't always live up to the hype but we have never walked away without enjoying our dinner.  The music is sometimes too loud for conversation, service is not consistent but we haven't had had any big issues."}
{"text":"Their mexican rolls are really good, amd the rolls are very big.   I would reccomend this place for those who are into experiencing new things, especially those who are avid sushi eaters."}
{"text":"Love the Mexican infuse sushi... a must try sushi Guamuchilito. Service n atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"Sushi with Mex fusion, is what you can expect. best of both worlds in my book!   Place is dark and trendy. nearby west gate.   food is good and reasonably priced.   Will be visiting their new location"}
{"text":"Great variety of Sushi, specially all of the Mexican rolls! Great environment! Service was great and will definitely go back. I highly suggest it!"}
{"text":"Sat ourselves at the bar. 3 waiters looked at us looked away, and walked by. Finally, someone offered to make us a drink. They were all grumpy. Blah."}
{"text":"We bought one of those entertainment books from Costco and they are listed in there however they do not honor it. So beware if you are planning to try it. I have already reported to the entertainment folks so they can handle this."}
{"text":"Amazing drinks and delicious sushi definitely will be back. I was really hesitate when I heard Mexican sushi (I am 100% Mexican) but I am so glad I decided to try this place out. This place will now be my one and pony sushi spot."}
{"text":"3 stars is generous based on the lack of a real bartender, the inaccurate/incomplete descriptions of the entrees on their menu, and lukewarm miso. The server did her best with what she had and service overall was good. May or may not come back to give them another chance."}
{"text":"I loved the firecracker jalapenos.  Awesome.  The rest of the food was as good as I could have expected, no complaints and will return!  They have a new waitress who was friendly and everything was delivered promptly to the table with no issues.    The large wall up front means they don't see people enter the restaurant so you might find yourself standing there awhile.  Or you could be like me and peek around the wall and wave like an idiot which worked like a charm.  Overall, they are a new business and are hopefully learning as they go... but we will definitely be going back with kids in tow."}
{"text":"The mix of Mexican sushi rolls is incredible. Marina is a great waitress and Alan is a fantastic sushi chef. The food is extremely tasty and the portions are bundance. You definitely get your money's worth and the flavors incredible!"}
{"text":"I used to go to Sushi Nola, but not anymore! El Tataki is hands down the best! The service was a little slow in the beginning when they first opened but I have been here multiple times since then and could not have been happier!"}
{"text":"A good spot for lunch.  Not crowded. It usually has loud music on and a tad on the slow side, but friendly service and large, tasty sushi rolls make up for that.  Favorites include the Mexican, Rainbow Seniorita, Tootsie Rolls.  Carne Asada Burrito is good too."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went on a Friday afternoon so it wasn't crowded but there were a few tables with guests. We had good service. The firecracker jalapenos were the bomb... with cream cheese and crab deep fried... very good. We wanted to try a mexican roll so we ordered the carne asada. It was large but just okay. The meat was like the kind of dry stuff you might get on a cheap taco with a little grit and it tasted funny with the orange and eel sauce. We thought the mexican roll might enjoy some salsa instead. We tried a California roll under the traditional menu; it was okay too, lots of crab, that's about it. In all, the bill for 3 items and one tea was $32+tx+tip but due to the large portions we had leftovers to go.  Noticed they do have a bar."}
{"text":"The food here is really good but the service is horrible I got put on hold and left there every time I place a pickup order and I won't be able to call again because they forgot about the phone this has happened 4 times"}
{"text":"Truly one of the worst restaurants I've ever eaten at. Service was bad, employees were u professional and inattentive. I ordered chicken nachos and got nachos that you get from a concession stand at a little league game. I only came in here because it was the only place I could get in at on gameday and there's a reason why."}
{"text":"Mexican and sushi together not a good combination.  Not satisfied with the food at all. Service was less then average given the fact that there were only 2 other customers in the whole place"}
{"text":"Stayed at a Hotel near by this place and decided to try as we were driving by. Got in with a nice welcome. Not expecting too much for Japanese rolls in Arizona. We were Very surprised that it was actually very good. The service was great and friendly.  The prices are not bad at all and the portions are pretty big. Overall, it was very delicious minus the Carne asada tacos which were dry and kinda bland. I can say I would definitely come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance came at 1:30pm for lunch got a sushi roll. The Miso soup was good & the El Mechudo roll  tasty! I sat outside service was a little slow for not being busy but food was fast. Overall, nice place and good food.  The music is nice except walking it to some baby making music was awkward."}
{"text":"I love trying new things and Mexican sushi was definitely different! We ordered the Mexican rolls,  the guamucholito rolls and the jalapeño firecrackers. They were all excellent,  though we did prefer the Mexican rolls to the guamucholito. The service was fast and friendly as well."}
{"text":"Second visit here in a year both times for lunch. It wasn't terrible the first time but when we got our food the second time I remembered what we didn't like the first time - TOO salty! This time around was worse, horrible stench when we walked in and it was uncomfortably hot. After 2 steps, should have left but stayed and decided no sushi for me after being welcomed with that bad smell! Service was below average, especially since one persons salad was never brought out until she brought it to their attention - the rest of the party was pretty much done eating by then. Two beef burritos ordered, the meat was very salty as well as in the chicken fried rice, which was also very greasy. One person ended up skipping dinner because the chicken fried rice didn't settle too well. Didn't take any pictures of the dishes because there was no dish ordered among a party of 9 that was visually appealing at all."}
{"text":"Very upsetting that this is the second time I called them to place an order for pick up and they had me on hold for 10 minutes. I decided to hang up and call again and all of a sudden the phones were down. I went over there and there was literally no one in there for them to be busy and to put me on hold for so long or at all. Just shows poor service and how lazy they are there."}
{"text":"The food is great, we've been there 3 times and all of the 3 times service has been great. Sushi is a little too big but its delicious."}
{"text":"First time here. I was very excited to try mexican sushi for the first time. Food was great and tasty. Customer service was good. Except towards the end.... I found a hair sticking up in the tail of my tempura shrimp  I couldn't believe it!!! It totally ruined my experience . The cooks definetely need to wear hair nets!!!!"}
{"text":"I came to this place at random to meet some friends for dinner I didn't know what to expect at first I thought but then I noticed it was a Mexican place and then I realized it was both. The food was great the atmosphere could use a little work but other than that it was nice and simple. who cares when the food is so damn good right? My favorite part was that it brought me back to when I go visit my family in Hermosillo."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Not a busy night and the waitress took for ever to take out orders. Waitress did not no what alcohol was served. Waitress was rude, owner was rude."}
{"text":"Service was slow. Menu needs variety. Overpriced. Place seemed clean. Carne Asada Roll was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Went here twice this week and loved it while in town for work. Service is pretty slow but there was a big party next to us that ordered a lot of rolls. However, the food made up for it. I had the jojo roll both times and it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Everything was very delicious we got the mar y tierra roll, and the milena roll. The wait was a bit but it was to be expected as there was a parry going on that they were not anticipating.  I highly recommend El Tataki for their service,  quality,  and environment/vibe. The music was great for those asking what kind it was mainly modern mexican. Manuel the owner/manager was on the floor and provided exceptional service,  as he was on the floor sitting/greeting guests, cleaning and even jumped into sushi making.  I quote my wife as he approached us to great us she's said \"he made me feel comfortable and welcome\" so yea 5 thumbs up Manuel  -Francisco 8a"}
{"text":"One, two, three strikes, you're out!  Let's just talk about last night's dinner:  I really wanted to love this place but it just wasn't working out.  Maybe it was the ripe sewer smell as soon as you walk in or maybe it was the lack of hot tea on a super cold December evening... I like to attribute it to the fact that they overuse the \"orange sauce\"  and unagi sauce on EVERYTHING.    It wasn't just a few artsy swirls of the \"orange sauce\" and unagi sauce.  They absolutely drench it.  You can dive in with scuba gear!  Maybe I didn't notice that I wasn't ordering a wide array of items but I swear almost everything I saw on the menu had the same sauce combo.  Eating the Firecracker Jalapeños, The Mexican Roll, and The Kamikaze Roll felt and tasted the same to me.  The only real difference between the two rolls was that The Mexican had peppers on top with cooked salmon and imitation crab while The Kamikaze had avocado on top with spicy tuna and tempura shrimp inside.  Other than that, it felt like we had three of the same dishes since the sauce was so overwhelming.  Thinking back to it is seriously making me feel a little queasy.  The tacos here are pretty decent and we ended up ordering edamame on the side to help switch up the taste after eating so much orange and unagi sauce.  Like I said, maybe they do have more variety and we didn't see any but I don't think I'll be back to test this theory.  Portions are pretty generous and you can at least ask for easy sauce but it's your poison if you choose to dine here.  Too many great places to eat to just settle for sauce-drenched-everything.  Service here could also be a little better considering when we went, we were just one of three tables.  $27 each [for 2 ppl] including tip for edamame, firecracker jalapeños, two rolls, three tacos, and an iced tea."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time today... Stopped in today for a couple California Rolls. Was in a rush to get back home for an online training class so I asked for them to go. Got home & they'd only given me the rolls. NO ginger, wasabi or anything. It occurred to me that perhaps this being a spot with sushi variations that perhaps they don't have it but I called anyway to ask. Server said that they DO have it, but only if you're dining in. :-0 I guess she heard the disappointment in my voice so she offered to pack some up if I wanted to come back. So we drove back & got the Ginger, Wasabi & Soy. Finally got back home & ate. Utterly disappointed. The nori was soggy & like, wilted & the flavor was more pungent than I've had before & because the rice was bland it really stood out. The wasabi was also horribly bland. No bite at all - the ginger had more punch than the wasabi! I always thought it was difficult to screw up a California roll, but I guess I was wrong! Some of the other menu items looked interesting though so I'm willing to trust that I just ordered too simple & am willing to try again with one of their specialties. That said - I won't make an effort to go again because the service sucked. I REALLY hate being inconvenienced for something I'm paying for."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat sushi at! I live close by and come here/order a take away probably once every two weeks haha..I love the firecracker jalapeños, lemon roll, señorita roll and vegas roll- yum! The rolls are big and delicious! The girls who work there are always friendly and rolls come out fast. They renovated the place inside (new chairs, booths, painted the walls) and it looks really nice! Also, they now offer free miso soup as well :) love love love this place"}
{"text":"I should have read the reviews and believed them. We got in and we're seated quickly, the waitress took our order for drinks. We had a larger group so I could understand a little bit of a wait for the drinks. We all grabbed some water to start and it took her 15 minutes for the drinks. That should have been our first red flag. Then we gave our food order and it took an hour and a half for them to bring out our food. We didn't get very much food and by the time we got it we were no longer hungry. The food was overpriced for the quality and representation. We saw our waitress two more times after that in which I was ignored asking to take back food because we did not want it. I received a birthday ice cream and it had hairs in it, of which could have came from anywhere. Upon asking for a food to be taken off of my receipt because we didn't eat it and tried to have it taken back, the waitress said we couldn't because of the time it had been on the table.   Tl;dr if you want a quick bite to eat with friends or want to get some nice food with great service, this is not the place for you.   If you like to pay way too much for gratuity (we were forced to pay 12.39 for each receipt) and get treated like you're invisible this place is perfect!"}
{"text":"Never seen or heard of Mexican sushi till I went out to AZ and this place was so good! The atmosphere was very nice the customer service was friendly. Price wise was reasonable, it's definitely a place to go and try out the food."}
{"text":"Very cool fusion sushi place!  Good food and good service. Definitely worth the stop."}
{"text":"For my second visit, I came with my Meetup sushi group. There were 11 of us. The food was fantastic. However, service started out great and ended crappy. One guy never got his order and after 45 minutes he cancelled. Another person didn't get her 2nd roll, but after reminding the waitress and another 10-15 minute wait, she finally got it. The waitress apologized to me (I was the event host) and said next time she'll do it different and better. The food WAS real good so perhaps we'll give them a try again in a few months.   On another note, if you might be interested in enjoying sushi at different venues throughout the valley with a great group of people, consider joining our Meetup:   http://www.meetup.com/sushilicious"}
