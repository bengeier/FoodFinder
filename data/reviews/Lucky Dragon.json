{"text":"This place is fantastic. The service is fast and very friendly, portions are very generous, food is fresh and delicious. It is reasonably priced. 

We ordered curry with rice and a combination place of vegetables, rice and chicken balls. 

It is definitely worth a try. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a cheap, quiet, fresh and tasty meal."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised:)....probably more like 3.5. Ordered delivery tonight for the first time...this is NOT authentic Chinese, but it hit the spot for my General Tao's craving. We ordered chicken fried rice (pretty basic, neither great nor terrible), beef shanghai noodles (pretty good but a bit cheap on the meat), General Tao's chicken (quite tasty but only had onions, not the peppers I normally expect) and stir-fried garlicky broccoli (actually cooked perfect tender-crisp and seasoned nicely) and they threw in a free spring rolls, which I wouldn't pay for as they weren't good but hey, they were free. Total $42 including tax. Service was friendly and food arrived hot in about 35 mins. 

For the money, the portions weren't super generous but acceptable. Would definitely order again if the mood struck and I wasn't feeling like going to Chinatown."}
{"text":"I normally don't go out of my way to add a Business profile on Yelp to just review a restaurant but I did because this place definitely deserve it.  I live near the Junction (Dupont and Lansdowne) and I have ordered from a lot of the different Chinese restaurants in the area. This place is by far the best. The prices are reasonable, portions are great (always have left overs), and more importantly the food is fantastic.

Please give this place a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place!! You'll have a lot of hit or miss restaurants with these neighbourhood stores but this ones amazing! I'm usually quiet picky about chowmeins but they do it pretty good. They're also very nice people. This is one of my favourite restaurants."}
{"text":"We were impressed with how fast the delivery was. The food was was good, and their dinner for 4 fed 3 adults, and 2 kids 3 and 6 with enough left overs for another meal.  It was well priced considering the amount of food you get.    We will order from there again."}
{"text":"The service was really good..food was great didn't take long for delivery! Will definitely be ordering from Lucky Dragon on Weston rd again... BTW! lol i kept my eyes closed and fingers crossed before opening up my food was pleasantly surprised.. lol very happy with my food!"}
{"text":"I ordered their Vegetable Pad Thai and Vegetable with Cashew nuts from Skip The Dishes. The Pad thai was pretty good, nothing special, but the vegetable with cashew nuts had almost no flavour and kind of a weird smell to it for some reason I ended up having to cover it with lots of soy sauce to get at least some flavour to it."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese eve saw so much good comments about this place and was such a disappointment never again"}
{"text":"Everyone has their go-to for Chinese delivery, and this one is mine. 

Lucky Dragon has a very good mix of \"American\" Chinese staples and more traditional Chinese dishes (particularly Sichuan - their eggplant with minced pork and garlic is QUITE authentic). Everything is always prepared fresh, and even their less authentic, deep-fried offerings manage to still be tasty, light and crispy. 
After eating, I'm never left feeling an MSG headache or salt overload that causes me to be free-guzzling water.

Their prices are very reasonable and they always deliver quickly. $40 worth of food is portioned well enough to serve two people dinner, a midnight snack and lunch the next day. 

I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant 5 stars!!!!
Everything was prepared fast, fresh, and delicious! 
I always go to authentic Chinese restaurants either downtown or Mississauga and this restaurant is amazing! It didn't taste American at all. Very good and we will definitely go back. 
Thank goodness for the construction on keele or else I would never have seen it while passing by. A hidden gem."}
{"text":"Great tasting food , more than you would expect from a fast food style Chinese restaurant . When we don't feel like going to china town , we grab take out from here... 

We are glad we have a great local Chinese food spot"}
