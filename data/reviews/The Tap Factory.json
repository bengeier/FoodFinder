{"text":"My fiance and I went there last night for the first time. We chose it as a venue to meet up with some friends before moving to Texas. Food, drink selection, service, and overall atmosphere were great! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Today when we went the server said it was a little chaotic because the main chef is out right now. They had tacos for $2, my friend got three and added a salad, should have been $9 for that and she rang him for the regular three taco dinner for $10 instead and only 2 tacos came out. My steak salad supposed to not have cheese and it did, melted all over the steak. The dressings weren't anything special as advertised, a bbq ranch jus tasted like bbq sauce with mayo in it. It was not good. The beers are small and there were cobwebs in the window above the last booth. I won't be back. Locally, River House in Charleroi or By George in Monessen has he same feel but it much better."}
{"text":"Seated ourselves. Waiters sat at a table on their phones. Then came and took our order. Some of their Friends came in and got their orders taken and got their food before us. Other than staying tables side to friends the service wasn't terrible. Food was on average 6 out of 10 ...however this is the second time I was there and the first was at the bar. That was good service and the beer was cold... lots of different beers on tap. That aspect is a 8 out of 10 for me."}
{"text":"My best friend and I came here before a graduation party and had a blast! The beer was great and there was a variety of beer to choose from. The bartender let me sample a few beers that I had not heard of and then I decided what I wanted. The atmosphere is great and we had a great experience. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a Sunday evening, prior to visiting The Demon House. We are not very familiar with places to eat in Monongahela, so I really appreciated Yelp's assistance with finding a worthy spot to dine. We decided upon this place considering it was right down the road from the haunted house and had good reviews. We had a very good experience here. It's a small place, but seems pretty new. It was a really clean establishment, which is always great! Our server was the only server working- she had a few other tables, so we had to wait a while for drinks, but that's completely fine and we had no problem waiting. The food was really good. We started off with the mozzarella sticks- VERY good. I went with the chicken & waffle sandwich with fries as my meal and Brendan ordered the burger with fries. Both meals were good and satisfying. I tried the Asian chili wing sauce with the fries, which appeared to be made in house and was really tasty! Overall, we had a very good experience here and if we are out in this area again, I would absolutely come back here (and I am ordering the wings!) :)."}
{"text":"We went here to watch the Steelers game. Great choice.  The Factory Trash wing sauce is fire, get it.  Good beer selection.  Great tv placement and sufficient amount of tvs."}
{"text":"Great little sports bar near Monongahela just off RT 43.  Excellent food, plenty of TVs, and an awesome staff.  A couple of dozen beers on tap, most of them craft!!!  What more do you need???"}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere even better food all for very reasonable prices we love it here. They have many different kinds of beer. The specials are top notch"}
{"text":"My family and I love visiting this restaurant. There is always and excellent beer selection. The wings on Sundays are good. I really like the unique salad dressings, the Mango Chardonnay is incredible. There are some excellent servers in this restaurant as well. We visit pretty often and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"I went here not long ago with my friend and her family on a Friday night. This place was PACKED. The bartenders were doing an amazing job at keeping up with all of the drink orders and I never had to wait very long to order a drink even with the bar as crowded as it was. They were also very clearly enjoying their job and were super personable and friendly. Honestly the best service I've had. 

The selection of beers is great. There's something for everyone, plus it's a full bar if beer isn't your thing. The atmosphere is pretty laid back and a great place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Place was absolutely amazing. Food and brew was good. Excellent service. Overall very happy we went. This is a place I hope sticks around."}
{"text":"I have been here three times now since it opened a few weeks ago. This is by far my new favorite place to eat in the Mon Valley. I am so happy they remodeled this place into something amazing. Such a huge upgrade from what it was before. The food is awesome- I haven't had anything yet that I didn't love. The seafood pasta is to die for! The philly steak hoagie, turkey club, and buff chick dip are the other items I tried, and all are excellent. I am going to lunch here tomorrow and my next order is going to be the chicken and waffles. Can't wait!!!
Also gotta love the beer selection :)"}
{"text":"First off, I want to say - look at the rest of my reviews... I ALMOST NEVER give a bad review. I truly try my best to be a \"say something nice or don't say it at all\" kind of person.... BUT, this place has numerous problems... So I felt compelled..

1) The owner(s): the place is co-owned by 3 men. Two of which are more \"silent\" partners and one of which is very prominent in the day to day.. He, for the most part, is not that bad; HOWEVER, it is his fiancée who is omnipresent along side him (just look down the customers left side of the bar - you probably won't miss them).. when she is with him, SHE IS EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL. Eavesdropping in on every single conversation occurring, interrupting and commenting in on private discussions, and, when told it's a private discussion, she becomes belligerent, offensive, and profane. She even goes so far as to say \"well, this is my bar and if you don't like it then leave\"... I have NEVER felt so uncomfortable in an establishment in my life - from NYC to Miami to Chicago to LA! And her fiancée, the actual co-owner, just sits there and let's her and the staff (see below) behave this way... He actually did come up to us once and apologize in private.. Clearly has no control of his staff.. 

2) The staff: Let's do A) servers and B) bartenders:
A) the servers are - 100% - young, inexperienced and female... I don't say this as a judgement - just wait... hear me out.. So, no one in the  place has any - ANY - experience. The service sucks! To say the least. But at the bare minimum, when seated at the tables, the poor girls try.. and struggle.. They have obviously not been trained (see #1 as the issue here)... It is obvious that they were hired based on age and gender and are completely objectified by the owners... They are ill-prepared and poorly treated, from what I have seen. 


B) the bartenders: First of all, refer back to #1. I have been in to eat twice (at tables) and have sat at the bar 4-5 times. When the co-owner and his fiancée are there sitting at the bar, which is ALMOST ALL THE TIME, the bartenders are TERRIBLE. They spend the entire time either standing or sitting right at the end of the bar ENGROSSED IN CONVERSATION with the co-owner and his fiancée.. Try to get the bartender, which of course there is only one - young and untrained girl, and you get ignored... As they claim, they didn't hear you! Try again, and again, and again, and what do you get? You get \"Did you just 'HEY' me?\", \"Are you waving your arm at me asshole?\", \"How did you just pronounce my name!!\", or \"Did you just fucking snap your fingers at me?\"... REALLY!?? Are you serious!!?? No one has even looked at the bar for 15-20minutes... it seems like the only time they look at you is WHEN they are ENGROSSED IN YOUR PRIVATE CONVERSATION.. Otherwise, you may as well go home - no one is serving you or seeing you... And I noticed the bar service is especially bad when the owners fiancée is sitting on there! I could go on.. 

Once, a regular next to me said to the bartender, \"I don't need the menu, I'll have the turkey club\"..  She replied, \"We don't have a turkey club. You better look at the menu\". Then tossed it at him. He immediately opened the menu and pointed to the turkey club.. Her response? \"Oh, guess we still have that\"... as she turned away from him... No apology. 

3) The food: since I have rambled on up til now, let me simply say - it sucks.. there are some ok items, the loaded tater tots and the turkey club - IF the staff remembers they have it and you can get it! GOOD LUCK! .. Otherwise, it's all too greasy, too undercooked, too overcooked, too overpriced.. Italian food is clearly pre-frozen and the sauce is runny watery garbage. Plus the menu doesn't include wings or burgers except as a special, one day a week item - in the Mon Valley!??? WTF?? 

4) The \"taps\": again, they suck. Way, way overpriced. Micros that have been out for 8-12 months elsewhere - or longer - are touted as some new thing and priced at a premium. The beer board or tap list IS NOT UPDATED... and when an inquiry is posed, just see #1 and #2 regarding the owners and staff... You may as well ask a wall or prepare for confrontation.. 

The summary - This is no Coyote Ugly, which I have been to - a few times - in NYC... Owners and staff should not have this attitude with the customers! And I don't think the customers come out in this area for this bullshit! PLEASE AVOID THIS PLACE! Why wouldn't you!!?? Especially for food - with the River House, Foster House, Angelo's, and other very solid local eateries in the area! Well, now to think of it - WITH ALL THE LOCAL BARS AND CLUBS where any beer you want is pennies compared to this rip off, WHY WOULD YOU COME HERE?? PLUS ELSEWHERE IT IS ALL SERVED WITH RESPECT AND A SMILE!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to check this place out last night, we were told it was decent from a few people and they have a decent tap list. The only list I could find was from almost a month ago, but listed what I was looking for (Arsenal) and had some IPAs he was interested in, so we headed out. They gave us a paper list that was the same as what I saw online, but they were out of both Arsenal. (Arsenal is a local hard cider if you aren't familiar.) I do not drink beer aside from a few Flanders red ales or oud brouin/Belgian, so I was disappointed. The waitress then says \"If you like that fruity stuff, I have something for you to try.\" I ask what it is, because the list had nothing on it I would like. She was going to bring me an Apricot Blue Moon. fruity wheat beer is not even close to a hard cider. For the love of god, do not recommend beers if you know nothing about them. Then, my husband wanted wings. It's bar, right? So they will have wings? Apparently only Sun/Mon. He drank his beer and we ended up leaving. I would strongly recommend keeping an updated tap list somewhere. Take a photo daily, use a site like untappd, SOMETHING. Also? UPDATE THE PAPER TAP LISTS. I doubt we will give them another try unless we hear that they made some updates."}
