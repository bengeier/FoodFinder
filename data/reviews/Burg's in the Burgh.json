{"text":"This is a great cheap place to eat. If you want a quick lunch or a good dinner before the pens game go here. Quick service at the counter and you get great food for your money. I bought a pastrami and it was thick with meat.   If you've gone to Sammy's that used to be in this location previously it is almost exactly the same it seems. You get a great sandwich for the money and is great that its near my college campus as it seems like you cant get a half decent sandwich without spending $13 dollars. I got a large pastrami, with pickle, a straub beer, and free popcorn for $8. You cant beat that."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, but I order the reuben every time. It's really good, and I get cravings for it. They offer two sizes and the \"smaller\" size is the size of a regular sandwich and I think it's around $5 so it's a pretty good deal. (The guy at the counter always asks if I want a free pickle which I find kindof funny, but I don't really like the pickles. They are HUGE but not very crunchy.) When you walk in, it's kind of dark, and if it weren't for the people sitting on the porch-type thing outside you might wonder if they are even open. It's mostly a bar, but they have a deli counter in the middle. The guys making sandwiches look kind of tough/rough, but they are very nice and sweet: you can tell they really appreciate the lunch business. There's pretty much never a line in there (but there's usually 1-5 people having a beer). It's not super clean or new (it used to be \"Sammy's\" if you remember that place) but overall if you want a good cheap Pittsburgh owned place to eat it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Good for a quick lunch. Corned beef was good but a tad dry. Solid sandwich though!  Good deli pickles. We came in for lunch and there wasn't much of a crowd. This definitely seems like more of an after work kind of place."}
{"text":"Excellent bar with deli sandwiches. Cheap beer and food for in the city. Very diverse crowd."}
{"text":"If you love corned beef and pastrami sandwiches this is the place for you. They have two downtown locations and the service is excellent. The food is delicious and the place is clean. Great for lunch or happy hour. The sell Dr. Brown soda which I absolutely love. The bread is fresh and the meat is lean! Good times!"}
{"text":"Anytime I'm down by Consol there's only one place I go, Burg's! Yummy, quickly prepared food. Not fast food, think deli food. Although, my favorite is the all beef 1/4 pound hot dog! Killer prices too! 1/2 sandwichs 3.50-3.75 or get the whole thing for just 5.50-6 bucks. Wanna drink downtown, but not pay downtown prices? GO HERE! If you're going to Consol for anything, park next door, on the left, at the garage. It's usually 10 bucks for any event! That's 1/2 price from basically everything else and you're only 2-3 blocks from the venue. The bar is attached via hallway from the garage. It's a perfect one two punch to make whatever you've got going on a knockout!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not the place we were expecting it to be. Was in the mood for a burger, and that's not anything that they have. Basically just a deli. Out of most of the foods from their lunch today. Very weird place."}
{"text":"Burg's is actually a pretty solid place despite some of the reviews on here. So convenient to anything downtown, my favorite is for Pirate games! Park in the garage next door, stop in for some beers and a sandwich, then either walk to the game or hop onto the T. There ya have it! Their sandwiches are piled high with delicious meats and toppings, plus the pickles are my favorite. The service from the bartenders is always great as well. Give Burg's a shot!"}
