{"text":"It's wonderful to have a casual, upscale sports bar in the neighborhood. The staff is friendly and accomodating- from the hostesses who offered a genuine smile upon entering and a coupon on the way out...the bartender who helped me find new ways to drink a flavored vodka...and the manager who took a table reservation for a busy college Bowl game night.   I have been three times the past month for drinks and dinner with the family, including one night with my children. I can't wait to return to take advantage of the happy hour specials, as well as the fire pit and live music on the patio.   Thank you Dan Majerle!"}
{"text":"A very ordinary sports bar.  Positives:  clean, attractive (if somewhat sterile) atmosphere; friendly, attentive, gorgeous staff; big-screen TVs and enormous projection TVs visible from any table make it a good place to watch a game.  Negatives:  need more craft beers on tap; menu somewhat boring and food needs seasoning (SW Turkey sandwich bland, side cole slaw lifeless); took 10 minutes to get my first beer even on a slow Sunday night.  Would give an extra star for fixing any one of those issues, two if all were fixed."}
{"text":"Nice place, great service, but the food is bad.  Went to watch the Monday Night Football game with friends.  We sat at the bar and got great service from Jenn and Issac.  Happy hour drink prices are good, but at 7:00 we had to pay the full price, which is kind of high.  They have flat screens everywhere with the game sound on, so all was good until the food arrived.  We started with Nachos, which were very mediocre.  Just cheese poured over cold chips.  Then  I ordered sliders cooked \"medium\", and Jim ordered a cheeseburger \"medium\"  The order took a long time, and we found out why.  The burgers were so overcooked and dry, we took a few bites and left them.  The fries were probably good five minutes earlier, but they arrived cold.  We spent a lot of money at Majerle's only to have to stop at In and Out Burger to get something to eat.     If you want to watch the game with a drink, Majerle's is good.  But don't go there to eat.  I'd consider it a bar, not a restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and have been looking for a place to become a regular at. Every time I go in, I'm greeted with a smile and a warm hello and the bartenders already know what I drink! All of the patrons are friendly and everyone seems to get along. For being an out-of-towner, this place has really become a home away from home. :)"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Majerle's and I have to say, we were pleasantly surprised. Walking in I wasn't sure if the food would be good, looks like a fun place to have a drink and watch the game, but didn't seem like a place this picky eater would like. I have to say the food was fabulous, the BBQ chicken sandwich was amazing and the bun was soft and very tasty. Oh and the fries were shoestring and crispy - YUMMY. We'll be back! Thank you."}
{"text":"This place is great. The staff is so nice and sweet and understand if you can't eat bacon  did not give me a problem at all . Manger just came by and ask how everything was and so nice about it. Nice music and kid friendly. Super cool."}
{"text":"I think this is my first one star review, but I'm afraid I have to.  I considered a two star review, just because I understand restaurants that are named after sports celebrities are usually selling a name and not quality, but Majerle's worked hard to earn one star, start to finish.   We arrived to dirty tables.  Not only ours, but we were surprised to see other parties being seated at dirty tables.  This was during the first round of March Madness, and they really had a tough time figuring out what channels to find the multiple games.  Very slow service, which I rarely complain about. Started with the wings, which were pretty bad.  I've had much better from the frozen food aisle.  Keeping the tables clear and waters full was a challenge, but we were reassured by the server that she had asked the busser to do it, but the busser had not done it.    Entrees were OK, but far from great.  We joked that when the server asked if how I wanted my steak sandwich cooked, she technically did not say that they would cook it that way, because my medium rare looked a lot like medium well.    The most grievous sin happened later in the evening.  Lots of TVs were showing various sporting events, but the main TV (with sound) was set to a channel of a completed game, and they had moved on to the local news.  A crowded sports bar on a Saturday night, and for well over a half hour, the background noise and primary TV were set on local Arizona news.  Weather report, local crime report, local news puff piece.  Makes for a fun, sports bar atmosphere, no?  I'm not sure how such a thing goes on in a sports bar, especially during March Madness.    The evening was topped off with a pretty horrible cookie/ice cream dessert.  I don't think it was really ice cream, but ice milk.  The cookie tasted more like a cookie cake.  Pretty bad.    I guess this is more of a tourist trap and not a place that someone would visit on purpose more than once.  I guess I got trapped."}
{"text":"This restaurant has great service with great food!! Plenty of tv's to watch any sporting event and their sweet potato fries are on point!!"}
{"text":"Best sports bar in Valley hands down. Food is great ... service is better. This is the norm at all locations.  I was an original Downtown Majerles regular andnow that I am on the westside its the only place that I will go to watch a game and get a beer."}
{"text":"Was our first time here but not Our last! Very friendly and accommodating. Loved the layout of the tv's for football viewing. Our server Jen was so sweet and very attentive. The food was great we had Reuben grills really good. Would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love this bar i come 3-4 times a week to watch the suns or dbacks games and have a few drinks. Great atmosphere and by far my favorite staff of any other local bar they always take care of me:)"}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch meeting, and it was very nice and quiet. Service was good, staff was polite and attentive. I ordered the southwestern chicken pasta - delish!!! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good burgers and friendly, non-intrusive service.  I had the spicy Doug & Wolf w/pepperoncini, jalape√±os and pepper jack cheese--only on the Goodyear location's menu)  Ordered the hot buffalo sauce on the side for the fries and the sauce was yummy! Next time I'll have to check out the wings based on the sauce alone. My friend ordered the Mama Majerle's Burger (mushrooms, onions and mozzarella) --I had a bite and it was fine, but I'm partial to my choice.   Happy hour specials looked okay (about $6 for apps + discounted drinks) even though I didn't order any.   I was excited to see that they had live trivia that started around 8 (Wed) which was fun and easygoing.   All and all, nice sports bar and grill for decent food/service that feels clean and family-friendly."}
{"text":"Great place to eat great customer service. Tori is the best go see her.  It's my new place"}
{"text":"Stopped in here with the gf for a quick drink and some Happy Hour food. We've been to the one downtown and had a good time so we thought we'd try this one out. We sat at the bar. Staff was friendly. Smelled like potpourri at the bar. Not that it was bad or anything. Kinda reminded me of my Moms house. Lol. All in all I'd go back."}
{"text":"Alexis and Sarah are always amazing. The food was great quality and fresh. I enjoyed a routine apple and Kips Fried Chicken Salad. Yummy! Waited maybe 15 minutes for my food.  The only issue was the 4 jack-wagons at the Golden Tee game that were screaming, cursing and being the fools of the bar and scaring many patrons off with their behavior.  Management kept letting them continued to be served at the expense of the bartenders and service personal because they were afraid of confirmation.  The manager should be fired!!! I personally saw 4 couples leave making reference to the noise and childish behavior."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere! The only problem is deciding what to eat the food is delicious! Football games are on Sundays they have trivia during the week and also show most ufc fights. Definitely a spot you should check out"}
{"text":"met a few coworkers for happy hour a few weeks ago, friendly staff, great specials"}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times before for NFL games and always had a good experience so that's why we decided to come again for Super Bowl LI tonight. What a mistake that was... Our server, a girl name Raina P was the worst server I had, ANYWHERE, in a ver long time! Since the beginning, we noticed something wasn't right with her service towards our table...  We notice how courteous and joyful she was with others but, when she got to Us, she was quiet and indifferent. I must've say \"thank you\" to her 4 or 5 times after getting her to service Us without one single response back from her! We have to call her to get service several times after noticing she was \"busy\" watching the game and having fun with other customers. You could see the disdain in her face every time we call her attention.  After a while, one person in our party left around half time and her plate and empty bottles sat on the table,along with ours, until we told the manager to get someone to clean it up! EVERY OTHER TABLE she had around ours was clean way before that!  After we complained, the manager,Ms. Briana(who did took care of Us)apologized to Us and gave us 15% discount on our tab and some $5 coupons for next time ( as if it's going to be a next time)  The server, Raina P, is a black eye to what always has been great establishment and a good experience.It is a shame since we really like this place and the food was great!  Hope they take care of customer service because there are no amount of coupons that can cover for that."}
{"text":"We went on Friday night after 8pm. There wasn't many people in there probably because of the holiday weekend. Unfortunately the staff also took the night off. Our server kept disappearing in the back. We did get our order in and our beverages were fine. We ordered the tenderloin sliders and sweet potato fries to snack on. The kitchen staff should have taken the night off too. The tenderloin tasted like shoe leather. It was absolutely awful. It was dry and tough. It came on those rolls you buy at thanksgiving and they were dry too. Just get the burger sliders, you might have better luck. I might go back but just to drink and watch the games."}
{"text":"We used to come here regularly always good and quick. The last 3 times we have been here we have had to sit and wait for at least 5 min before anyone comes to get our drink order. Food takes forever to get and then is cold.  Decided this is my last time here. Just not good or worth the frustration and money."}
{"text":"Food was good...plenty of tv's to watch the game but we were served a mug of beer with lipstick on it and the idiot manager opened the glass wall with it being 100 degrees out to accommodate one outside table leaving all of us at the bar to sweat our a!#&* off. Poor management..... we will never return"}
{"text":"Stopped in at opening for an early lunch. Not sure what was going on; a few people standing around. No one working that I saw. Left without as much as a hello from anyone after 15 minutes of patiently waiting."}
{"text":"Stopped here today for a couple drinks and an appy. Please wait to be seated...we stood there for way too long before someone approached us (there wasn't a person in there). Asked to be sat outside, which we were. The table had a layer of desert dust on it, and the chairs were extremely dirty. The other tables had debris on them from the trees. Inquired about blended drinks and was told they make 3-daiquiris, pina coladas, and margaritas.(That's when I should have inquired about the price) Anyways, one order of HH Nachos $6, 2 Bud Draft $5 and 2 Straw Daiqs $16!!!!!!! Way over priced on the blended drinks. The waitress was attentive but will definitely NOT be back!! There's way too many other places in Arizona with cheaper prices-Westgate for one!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stop by for a late lunch or early dinner and hit the happy hour food. You do get a slightly smaller order than normal but at half price its still a good deal. Had the boneless wings and its always good.  I had the Southwest Chicken Pasta and it does not disappoint. Lots of chicken to go around. Probably the best thing I have had on the menu."}
{"text":"Typical bar food, was ok. Garlic wings were really good. Atmosphere was perfect sports bar and service was great. Was just visiting the area and would not come back."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and delicious chicken nachos!  We also had a burger which was just average.  Overall, good place and we will definitely be coming again."}
{"text":"Food was brutal! Appetizers really awful. Out of good Chardonnay two days in a row. Glass of wine for $8 is half a warm glass. No tomato juice for a Bloody Mary. Bartender boarded on unfriendly.   Tried 3 times now never again ! Oh where is Dan Majerles or even a Manager ?"}
{"text":"Was kinda dragged here as I'm not any kind of sports fanatic nor usually a fan of the kind of food that tends 2 correl8 w/ such, but have 2 say I was rather pleasantly surprised by my visit here.     Nice atmosphere & interior welcomed our fairly large party, far different from the obnoxious overbearingly loud rowdiness & tacky sport team coloring typically found in similar places. Of course it was lunch & not much in the way of games was happening @ the time but hey, I'll take it whenever I have 2 accompany my sport~luving eating companions.     Our w8tress was very friendly, professional, efficiently accomod8ing ~ I especially liked how she interacted w/ my friend's kids who were in tow. She was either a mom herself or just knew how 2 make kids feel as important as the adults.      I started w/ the Spinach Queso Dip & a side of sweet potato fries which were both amazing in their flavors, texture & consistency. Fries were Perfect: outer crispness soft inside ~ not greasy, limp or overly~fried. Spinach Queso Dip was 'almost' up there w/ my fave = Elephant Bar's (which is saying A Lot)!       4 my entree I ordered the Strawberry Field's Salad (sans the chicken of course) & it was SUPERB. It comes w/ a bed of mixed greens (grilled chicken), strawberry wedges, candied pecans, feta cheese and strawberry vinaigrette which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ~ I was so blown away by it's Goodness I placed another order of it 2~go & tried seeing if I could buy some of that AMAZING strawberry dressing 4 personal use @ home but 2 no avail, wasn't available that way (or they're keepin' it a secret)!     I noticed there r quite a few different options available 4 Veg~heads here & of course dishes can b customized minus items such as what I did w/ the salad which was my Fave of all the 1derful things I'd partaken of while here. So YES I look 4ward 2 returning UN~reluctantly 2 try other things from their surprisingly extensive menu & might even brave Superbowl in full swing 2 do so (which is the personal BIGGEST COMPLIMENT they can get from me)!! Majerle's just acquired another fan... just 4 different reasons ~ Tee~hee! ;-)"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Had the  burger of the month (cabernet burger) one of the best burgers I have ever had. Hubby ordered Honey sriracha wings. They were so meaty and delicious, we will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"It's hard to write a negative review about a Valley staple. We've been going to Majerle's since it was a single location downtown. It's a dependable go-to spot. However, as we settled for dinner Friday night, we finally realized that we no longer go to Majerle's because we want to, but rather because we knew it would be half empty and a group of us would have no trouble getting tables.   Sure enough, our two families were promptly seated in an almost empty dining room. The next thing we noticed was how outdated the menu was. We frequent different establishments 4-5 times a week and have noticed a trend toward lighter fare options while the menu here is typical heavy bar grub. There's no creativity or attraction for someone looking for a healthier option that's not a bland salad.   A warm spot is the diverse beer selection. Many options on tap, including my favorite, Papago Brewery's Orange Blossom! Staff is friendly, managers frequently run food out of kitchen. However, management seems clueless to attracting more business.   While we were having our family dinner with our teenagers, the facility was hosting a karaoke night. Imagine our surprise and disappointment when management allows a song with b*tch & f*ck all over it. While the words were written as above nobody stopped the singer from yelling them out over the restaurant's sound system. It never occurred to management, or karaoke staff, that maybe playing that song around 10:00 pm and while families are dining, may not be a good idea. So that lost them another star in the rating.   Overall, if you are running short on time and need a place to grab a drink and don't mind typical bar food, go to Majerle's. It will always be half empty.."}
{"text":"One of the best places to go get food and watch sports at the same time. I work next door to the restaurant in Goodyear and always go grab a bite and watch sports there. Two thumbs up if you ask me."}
{"text":"Awesome spot for happy hour, I loved their nachos =)"}
{"text":"We were originally going to Buffalo Wild Wings across the way since it always plays all the Sunday Football games but we saw the patio and heard the cheers coming from Majerle's and decided to give it a shot. Best decision!!! We sat at the patio and of course the AZ game was the only one with the sound up but all the other games were playing and clearly visible. They waitstaff was attentive. The food was great! We had the soup/salad combo, it was a ceasar salad and chili both were on point. I know it's nothing fancy but to me if a place can't get those basic staples down, I don't have much hope for the rest. We also had their fries (regular, not sweet potatoes) and they were cut shoestring style which I love. All in all we had a great experience and can't wait to come back. :)"}
{"text":"Food isn't great, but going here for sports and drinking is definitely a good time. Not as packed as some of the more popular sports bars in town, but it gets just as loud when the home team is doing good (or bad...)."}
{"text":"Husband and I stopped by for lunch one day on a whim. We were hungry, saw it driving by and popped in.  We were greeted ad soon as we walked in.  Never been here before. First impression, clean, attractive spacious.  Plenty of tvs.  Set up seems to be comparable to other \"Sports bars/eateries.\"  Sat in a booth--comfortable, waitress was polite.  Ordered wings and fries, couple of sodas.  It was all ok. Wings were nice and big, decent taste, but not necessarily \"better\" then what we've had elsewhere.  Took awhile to get our orders although it didn't seem overly busy (we went to late lunch around 1400, had to flag waitress down for refills.)    Food was mediocre, overpriced.  Service was mediocre (slow service, minimal followup) Not impressed, it \"filled the hole.\"  It wasn't terrible, but easn't memorable either. Might try again if in the area to keep it real....might have been an \"off\" day.   As of now, with so many other good eateries out there, not enough to make us \"crave\" it to come back....."}
{"text":"Good sports bar. Lots of TV's bacon cheese fries were good"}
{"text":"My son and I went twice while in town to see reds.  Great atmosphere, service, drinks and of course the food was excellent.  Loved watching the march madness on the patio.  A must if you are in Goodyear!"}
{"text":"Went there to eat and watch Thursday Night Football. The parking lot was full and we didn't think we would get able to get a table, but did. But to get the table was problem. We had to wait at the hostess booth for the hostess to get off the phone. Her phone call was more important that doing her job. You could tell it was personal call because you could hear her said that I have to put you on hold, but she didn't do that. Finally someone else came to the hostess booth and they seated us. Service was good, food was good too. The manager actually stop to see how things went. I was surprise about that since most managers hide somewhere. Food came as we asked and it was done the way we wanted it. There was also one perk tonight. A Bud Light Girl came to our table and asked us if we wanted a free beer."}
{"text":"I went to Majerle's for happy hour with my buddies about 6 months ago.  The beer was cold and I ordered the nachos.  They tasted \"different\" but I didnt think much about it until about an hour later.   I ended up puking my insides out for the next two days.  Needless to say I still cant eat nachos anywhere......       I think I will not be returning..."}
{"text":"Service is oh so so bad! Waited for a good while to be seated on a Tuesday night when no one was there. Then never got menus. After about 15 minutes, we got up and left. No one seemed to care either. They saw us leave. Went over to Buffalo Wild Wings which is in same parking lot."}
{"text":"This place sucks!!! I have serious food allergies and routinely eat a no carbohydrate diet. As I usually do when getting ready to order food, I asked the bartender what I would be charged for a hamburger patty with cheddar cheese.  No bun, no garnish, no fries.  Just a hamburger patty with cheese.  She said she would ask the manager.  When she returned, she said it would be the full price of the regular hamburger meal. I told her to put everything but the patty with cheese on a separate plate and bring it out.  After all, if they were going to charge me for it, I should get it all.   She delivered my meal on 2 plates. I ate the burger patty with cheese and left the plate which was piled high with carbs until I was finished.  I then took my silver ware placed it on top of the carbs then placed my empty plate on top of the entire pile to indicate that I was finished. The young lady approached and asked if I would like anything else.  I politely said no and that I felt I was wasting a tremendous amount of food as it was. I then asked her to please point out the amount of food that was being wasted to the manager.  She asked me if I wanted to speak with the manager. I said no, just point out the waste.    I want to make a few things clear:  I am a huge fan of Dan Majerlie!  I wish they had given him the head coaching job for the Sun's.  He is a spectacular coach as is evidenced by the job he's doing at GCU.  I'm certain he would be disappointed in the way that his name was represented today.  I frequent restaurant's and sports bars all over the valley because I travel a lot for work.  Some managers can figure out how to charge a fair price and some can't.  This place didn't!  Also, as a business owner myself and having managed hundreds of people in businesses that are service based, I believe the lack of creativity on the part of the manager could be better described as laziness!  If he worked for me, he wouldn't have his job after reading this. For these reasons, I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Majerle's! I haven't been to the one in Scottsdale yet but I haven't been disappointed with Marjele's.   Marjele's in Goodyear is bigger than the one downtown but you can expect the same quality: good food, good drinks, great TVs, and great times!"}
{"text":"Never been here heard great things about the food. I must admit the food was great had the fried jelepeno burger. Best. The service sucks down right sucks, slow short staffed something cause it took awhile for anything to come out. Beer was warm not worthy of any stars in that case. Won't eat here again unless new management."}
{"text":"Nice sports bar atmosphere. They have a shrimp appetizer that is so mouthwatering! I wish it was an entree! Food is good - beer is good - we all left satisfied! Recommend the French Dip! We brought my daughter who was 1, and everyone was pretty okay with her being there."}
{"text":"Love the nachos! The best in town! A bit pricey compared to the competition but still love it there!"}
{"text":"As always, the food and service was great.  I had the Shrimp Tempura and the Sliders.  Both were very good.  I highly recommend this place as it also has TV's everywhere so you can watch every sporting event on.    TWO THUMBS UP!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and good service. My husband LOVES the cheese fries. The waitresses are always really nice and friendly. We also love this place because it's close to the house! Nice to have a sports bar close, especially with good food and service."}
{"text":"Great service, clean restaurant and great menu selection! WINGS WERE AWESOME! We had the Sriracha Honey limited wings but the \"gorilla\" ones and they were perfectly crispy! Burgers lacked salt but you can just add your own!"}
{"text":"Back to Majerle's for happy hour and to watch some of the Coyote's game..  Service was much better and the food just as good.  We will certainly make this a regular visit."}
{"text":"First time here and we were surprised with the food.  We would like to go again soon."}
{"text":"The service is always friendly, and the food is spot on. My favorite are the fish tacos, and their \"secret\" TC sauce for the wings is great. They have plenty of tv's, and they accommodate if you want one changed. Come for happy hour, they have great specials along with a big drink menu with delicious drinks."}
{"text":"My parents and I love Marjerle's. Their happy hour is good, love the wings. We end up going there and we all just get wings! The fried shrimp are great, and the brownie dessert is decadent and good. We've been here for trivia night and we won a $5 gift card, the emcee was funny and it was a nice way to spend a night! Great place to watch UFC or whatever game you like to see. Service is good, all the waitresses I've had have doted on us. Great sports bar, it'll always be one of our regular spots!"}
{"text":"Food is outstanding . Great bar food and the fries are to die for. Great place to hang out and watch games. Staff are all very nice , manager checks tables to see if customers are happy. Highly recommend going there for food and drinks and the good atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"The food was great. Drinks were awesome. Service...ya, that needs some work.   Our server didn't check on us once. We had to wait for place settings after our food arrived. To top it all off, she asked if if we were leaving. The place wasn't busy by any means. Asking if you were ready to leave while there is still food on the plates AND the drinks were half full is not great.   I will probably go again, but only if making sure she isn't our server. I think her name was Ashley."}
{"text":"Good service and food.   I stopped in recently for a late lunch with a friend and to watch the game. I took a seat near the TVs and there was hardly anyone there. My server was a sweetheart, checking up on me quite frequently and making sure I had refills of my drink.   When my friend arrived, we placed our orders. Their happy hour menu was a bit confusing because it didn't differentiate between the regular menu portions and the special happy hour portions. When we asked, we were told that the chicken strips would be less (minus a strip).   Everything was fine until we got our bill. Because I ordered fries, they went ahead and charged me full price for the strips. I was unaware that ordering fries would void any happy hour deal from them. So that was a bit of a letdown considering the service was so good.   In the end, I would still come back. But I would make sure that I am completely clear about what I can change with their happy hour menu before I place that order."}
{"text":"This single star is for the non existent service. After waiting to be served or even acknowledged, we decided to leave and try our luck elsewhere. We did not have the opportunity to try any food or drink."}
{"text":"I've seen this place for the longest time, but for some reason I never stopped in until I was on a whim this weekend. First time walking in the door the place has a nice vibe to it. We went on a Saturday and then again on a Sunday night. Both days football was on and good games at that. TV's are easy to see from wherever you are in the bar and the two big screens help out as well. Started out sampling some of the beer they had. I've got to say it's nice to see a place that carries some of the locals. For those who love Four Peaks brews like myself I was very pleased that somewhere on the west side of town carried it on draft. Our bar tender was great. She remembered my name both times coming in and even remembered on the second day what me and my wife both wanted to drink. Happy hour special here are great. 3.50 for pints and 2.50 domestics isn't a bad deal for happy hour anywhere. They also did 5 dollar apps which was nice for those not wanting to get stuff on a meal. We did end up ordering some food and it was pretty good. Overall I really enjoyed this place, beers were great, service was excellent, and it makes me want to come back."}
{"text":"Great food!!! The French dip is to die for!! Great Service! Clean and fancy especially for the area it's located in!  Def a hidden gem! My husband and I both love going here and can't wait until next time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend lives a mile away and we come here pretty often.   The food is actually really good. The Jalepeno burger is absolutely delicious.   Bloody Mary's are on point. Service is always good. Music is on point as well.   Only downside is that it's been really slow everytime we go in and we like talking to people and conversing. Would also be cool if there were some pool tables. ;)"}
{"text":"While my boyfriend is in town for Nascar , he and his team stay down the street at a hotel near this bar and grill. Looking for nightlife options midweek this is what we found. Not bad! We sat at the bar. I ordered my famous snakebite... and yeah.. they had to ask, but they did it and it came out very well. Had to have two since they opened two ciders and two guinness to make the drink. Good music.. some nights there is karaoke. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. The quesadilla on the appetizer menu is shareable and became a craveable favorite of my boyfriend and myself. Good bar!"}
{"text":"First time ordering from them , the sandwich was great! Got the club, but ALL i could think about was, do people know about these fries? HANDS DOWN best fries ever!"}
{"text":"My sandwich took 30 minutes for me to get. Really?? A sandwich?? Its worth a shot to try this spot. Alot of my friends like this place but not me. Too loud too have a conversation with someone sitting right next to you. The waitress took our order..brought out the food..gave us the check. . And not once asked if we needed anything. No refills. No more alcohol.  Napkins. Nothing.   Rude..I hate bad service.  If you dont want to wait on people then why are you here.  The only reason I gave 2 stars is because they have soooo many tvs.  And every sport on."}
{"text":"The place was typical sports bar. The food was better than most. Wings were gravy. Pizza was cool. Beer was good... except they ran out of my Hef. Stella worked just fine and tasted pretty on point. Can't complain... a lot of fans! All adults. They let kids in but I wouldn't bring them if you didn't have to! The place is filled with drunk and hungry/lonely people lol. I'd go back soon for some football and beers. Seemed like it could turn into a cool little spot for hubby and I to hang out at! Prices were expected. Nothing great! Nothing crazy. I say check it out!"}
{"text":"Overpriced drinks. Bartender and waitress flirt with each other before attending to customers"}
{"text":"We came in to watch some March Madness games.   The hostesses aren't the smartest bunch of girls in the world, ya know the type that's watching a basketball game and screams \"touchdown\".    The food was OK, it wasn't so bland that I wouldn't be back but not great enough that I'm making sure we make time to stop in again."}
{"text":"Pretty hostess , good customer service , we sat at the bar , got service within 2 minutes (although I was a duche complaining how no one say hi to us as we sat down hahaha . But anyways , food was delicious , and the even the manager came to check on us . Lots of dudes here watching the games (it's a sports bar ) so it makes sense . Pretty girls working all around . Nice place to eat and have a drink ."}
{"text":"Parking lot was packed! So I was hoping that it would be a good indicator that it was good food..I was not disappointed!  We had the nachos for an appetizer and it was better than I could have imagined! Seasoned ground beef, homemade cheese sauce, jalapenos and all the goodies!  We also had the bbq chicken pizza and it smelled amazing! AND tasted even better!  Service was good, food came out super fast, even though it was busy."}
{"text":"Marjerle's has above all: Good burgers! My favorite is probably the Mama Majerle's. This is also a good place to watch sports grab a beer and enjoy a good meal. I have also watched the World Cup here and had a great time with co-workers."}
{"text":"The best happy hour deals... and we love trivia Tuesday and Wednesday nights. The staff is always so friendly!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and my mother in law ordered a burger no bread and extra lettuce.  The ladies were so sweet they asked if she wanted leaf because they use shredded and went and constructed her a lettuce wrapped burger. They were eager to know if she enjoyed it because no one ever asked. My Bloody Mary was tasty and my Rueben was on point! The tender juicy corned beef was just right and they gave me plenty. This was one of the best Rueben's I have had in awhile. My husband had fish taco's and said flavor was great and they turned out delicious."}
{"text":"Great food, service was horrible for this location. I've been to the downtown and flagstaff locations with nothing but good things to say, charged us for things on the happy hour menu for full price and only saw our waitress 3 times during the meal. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Majerles Sports Bar has plenty of room and a large bar area! The service is great and the food is very good!   Majerles offers  a great Happy Hour menu with drinks and food. One of my usual food favorites is the Southwest Chicken Salad and Slam Dunk Shrimp which are both really good and large portions as well.   Majerles  is just a great place to catch a game, any game. I like the fact that Majerles keeps the volume on the game instead of playing music like some sports bars.  Majerles is the  perfect atmosphere to watch a game or just hang out with friends. If your in the area you should give Majerles a try because Thunder Dan's place is worth the visit."}
{"text":"First time here. Seated very quickly, then sat for 20 minutes without anyone stopping or even acknowledging us . Servers walked by 8 times ....Short stay as we left . POOR service. Will not return.   A quick stop to acknowledge would have saved the visit."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, I try not to hang out in Avondale for \"fun\" if I can avoid it...but since Majerle's is close, this is a decent option.  However, I will never again order a bowl of fresh fruit for $5 because it is just NOT worth it.  The dish was tiny, there was hardly any variety (or fruit, for that matter), and the pineapple was absolutely tasteless.  I've never had worse pineapple in my life, TBH.  But as far as drinks go, my beers were reliable and inexpensive. :)  And apparently my husband's tacos were very, very good.  Service was good, as well."}
{"text":"Typical sports bar. Wait staff were good. Husbands chicken sandwich extremely dry but they took care of it so get 4 stars. Burger were above average."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location, the menu is the same as the others and the food is just as good. The servers were very nice and accommodating to me and my 4 kiddos. If I am in the area I would go back."}
{"text":"Great steak sandwich and the fries have a great taste without any sauce. My wife had Mamas burger, the bun and mushrooms were great tasting, but the meat lacks flavor. We will give this place another try."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the bartender was very sweet.  Good service.  I ordered the Italian panini which was really good.    Our group came in for a baseball tournament and this was the closest bar to our hotel.  If we liked it, I guarantee we would have spent the rest of the trip here.    It was a Thursday night, which was Trivia night.  The trivia MC was very sweet.  A cute Australian gal who was very personable and tried to get everybody involved.    The problem....this is a sports bar.  The MC's mic was blasting loud.  I couldn't hold a conversation with a friend two chairs away.  I could have tolerated this if the trivia was on for 10-15 minutes and then we could watch the games in peace.   But the trivia game went on for hours.  Finally, after I finished my meal and enjoyed a couple large beers, I asked for my check.    I felt like I was on an episode of Bar Rescue.  I looked around at the other patrons, and everybody else seemed annoyed with the trivia.  The place wasn't very busy to begin with, but I can't imagine trivia night is a big draw for beer drinkers.    We won't be back."}
{"text":"on Oct 21 2015 wed @6 pm me and my baseball team went there to eat the waitresses that served my side of the table was very rude and unprofessional it was so bad that I had to write this bad review on this day that I never forgot that I had to write this  and how we were treated first off there were 20 of us sitting u figure someone would be there right away to help us out that wasn't the case when my ordered was placed I requested for wings beer and a water she never brought the water over I waited and asked her again she once didn't bring it over it took several times to ask her  I had to ask another waitress to bring me one. the waitress then responded to me why she didn't bring the water is because she had other customers to take care in a very rude manner which I asked for it when I first sat down what a horrible response and then when we needed service I see her sitting there with her friends and forgetting about us. we were there for a good time but the rudeness of the waitresses is unacceptable next time we play in the Goodyear area we will take our business to buffalo wild wings never again will I take my team there one of the worst servcer I ever had in my entire life"}
{"text":"Yikes! It's been a while since I was last here but this place has taken a turn for the worst. About 10 other patrons in here when I went and it was dead silent. No music, no tv volume, no talking- no energy! The appetizers were mediocre at best and while the service was fine, the food and atmosphere really ruined the experience. Will probably skip a return visit in the future!"}
{"text":"It was an ok experience.  My GF and I went in to simply grab a drink.  Outside of the obnoxious kids playing the golf game in the corner, it seemed like a standard sports bar.  Price were typical ($28 for 3 mixed drinks) and the selection of house special drinks was ok.  The server was good an attentive, outside of that an average location."}
{"text":"Majerle's is a fun sports bar.  I have eaten here probably 20 times over the last year but service seems to have dropped dramatically and so has my attendance.  Last time I ordered wings with \"maniac sauce\" and the server attempted to correct me, \"Um...do you mean the hot sauce?\".....\"Your menu calls it maniac sauce, figured that's what you'd call it.\"  Guess it confused her...  As a table of 3, we waited almost 40 minutes for a couple sandwiches last week.  Then the food came out without the right garnishments on the sandwiches.  Food is OK, above average overall.  Prices are reasonable ($10-$12 sandwiches/sides).  A lot of downtown employees get discount (I get 15%) which is why we used to eat here a lot...but slow service means you can't leave your desk, eat, and get back in an hour...which is the cardinal sin of a restaurant serving lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, only about 12 other people in the entire place.  VERY slow service (especially for having nearly no other customers), very unenthusiastic service, very average food, very high prices.  Methinks not. Ever. Again."}
{"text":"Since the closing of B-Dubs next door, this has become more of a favorite hang out! When I was a kid and we'd come to town on vacation (and I had a huge crush on Thunder Dan), we'd always go to the downtown location.  Now that I live in the West Valley and Majerle's is a 5 minute drive...I'm there often!  As mentioned in a few other reviews, the Gorilla Wings live up to their name! They're huge in size and in flavor.  The Buffalo Shrimp appetizer is freakin' phenomenal as well! You can get any of their sauces on the shrimp, so you can try something different each time.  Their fries are awesome, crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside.    As for entrees, they have a killer Ruben sandwich and their pastas are really good as well.    A full bar and wall to wall tv's makes this a great place to catch a game any night of the week.    I'm still waiting to catch a glimpse of Thunder Dan himself, and hopefully this time I won't make a food out of myself and completely freeze up like the one time I met him! ;-)"}
{"text":"Good service in terms of a special night. Waitress is attentive to our table.  Food and drinks good. Seating and environment is good. Keep it up, Majerli's!"}
{"text":"The only thing ok about this place was the pretzel bites. I got the French dip and it was awful. There was more fat then meat and the fries were so hard we might as well have been eating chips. Service was good but for how much we paid we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Okay this place is awesome adult Trivia on Thursday nights, they have an amazing black bean burgers which is nice for those of us who are vegan and vegetarian not to have to eat a boring salad. They have chips and Guacamole that is delicious. I will definitely be back and am so glad we didn't go to BWW right next door."}
{"text":"Tried Majerle's for the first time while in town for Spring Training and the food was great! My sister and I both and had burgers and were surprised by how large they were. The burger was excellent but the sweet bun really put it over the top. I would've given Majerle's only 4 stars but we had such excellent service.  Much love to Janie. She was amazing and didn't even mind that we were both dressed in Oakland A's jerseys, lol. Sweet, attentive, and awesome. Did I mention cute? She's cute. Thanks for the great service."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night around 8:50pm.  The place is like any sports bar, cool.  We were greeted promptly by the hostess.  She was nice and bubbly.  We sat in the booth and waited 5 mins before we are acknowledged by server.  It took another 5 to 7 mins before she came back to take our drink orders.  Then the drinks came pretty quick.  Then 15 mins go by before she is available to take our food.  We ordered appetizers and dinner.  It was 25 mins before the wings came and then the kicker was the wings were barely warm.  We were so hungry we inhaled them.  The medium was quite warm and the terriyaki was ok.  Our food took another 20 (Yes, 10pm) our dinners came.  The Margherita pizza and the M.J. Cordon Bleu sandwich was also good and served HOT but they messed up on the side, they put cole slaw instead of french fries.  The server brought my fries after another 10 mins.  We found out later from the server that the manager let some servers go earlier in the night."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a friend.  Got a large salad and spicy hot wings. It was surprisingly good.   Not the greatest drinks- the long island did not feel authentic. Don't know what they used but it wasn't the best."}
{"text":"Needed a fun place to drink and watch the UFC fight. Liked the pics and picked this place.  We were VERY IMPRESSED!!!  There was a $10 cover charge that was totally worth it. (For the fight)  The Rojo Diablo was amazing!  Prices were reasonable too.  Highly recommended this place for beer, great bar food, service, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Local spot that Is trying to be a national spot???!!Get real and be \"local.\"  Staff????? Nothing special.  Could be if they had some local focus. Average for sure."}
{"text":"First time visit. Very nice place, super clean and large. Plan to make this a go to sports bar. Burgers were excellent. On tap choices were ok. No gluten free beer or vodka is a bummer cause the wifey can't have gluten."}
{"text":"If you have a choice, go to the one downtown. I always get the buffalo shrimp, but at this Majerle's the coating was too thick. Not to mention, our ice tea tasted like dirt and service was horrible."}
{"text":"Bike night was a bust.  Parking lot was poorly lit.  Also, no happy hour til 9 like I was told by manager yesterday.  I called to see what specials they were having and was told by the manager that happy hour would be extended until 9 pm for bike night.  Bartender told me when I ordered my beer there was no happy hour."}
{"text":"Tired to place a pick up order. Tell says they don't close till 2 am. I called and called no one answer the phone."}
{"text":"With the closing of b dubbs that was right next door, marjeles has the wing game locked down. I highly recommend the gorilla wings, they are very big and meaty (haha, no homo). Great customer service and good prices, great place to go."}
{"text":"We are totally a fan of this sports bar ever since the abrupt closing of many local bars we frequent. We most likely would have never stopped in if it wasn't for the mailer offering BOGO for one entree. We started with a appetizer (the nachos with chicken) and our waitress was prompt and polite. My wife ordered a chicken Cesar wrap and she enjoyed everything. I ordered a spicy buffalo sandwich with shoestring fries and it was quite yummy as well. They have great drink specials and decent prices threw the whole menu. It was a mistake free dining experience, with little to no wait on anything. This is a perfect venue for a quick enjoyable dinner with the possibility to break conversation and watch the game.The food is a good view point of what bar fare SHOULD taste like / be. Be sure to stop by and try it out if your a Goodyear visitor or local, it's quite the nice escape from your frozen food Fridays / Chili's.  update: Don't go see UFC here... 10 dollars a head, too busy and little to no annoying crowd control. Many other bars offer no cover or 5 at the most, it almost toally threw me off the place if my wrap wasn't so damn good.   Try the Gorilla bites !"}
{"text":"The service was terrible. I walked in and was greeted by the hostess and went to the bar. Nobody acknowledge me or my existence. It was a slow night. I understand if it was busy or if you are doing many things at once, but the fact it was a slow night and I was standing there just waiting. I didn't want to yell and seem rude or it can be misconstrued as me being upset by the other customers. The Hostess that greeted me didn't even help get me any attention from the bartenders and just sat at the front. Like i said it was a slow night. I stood there where I just wanted to leave. So I left didn't even get to try out any food or beverages."}
{"text":"The PHX legend Dan Marjerle keeps on going with another solid restaurant. Great location. Food is very good and fresh. Started out with the gorilla wings and they were good. Be sure to get the secret sauce. There was four us and two got the all-star burger and two got the Asian chicken salad. Both were very good portions and quality meals. Capped it with a nice beer from the wide selection and you can't go wrong. Many tv's so you don't miss a game with variety of music playing in the background but not too loud. Service was very good and friendly. Definitely will be coming back to this spot again!"}
{"text":"The food is okay.  Pretty much what you'd expect at a sports bar.  Nothing exceptional, but nothing to really complain about, either.  Sometimes it can get busy during Cardinal games, but they didn't have any problem finding me a place to sit.  My only issue is that they were out of both of the beers I tried to order.  It might be a good idea if they stocked up on those two.  The manager came over and offered to buy me a beer, so I ordered a Blue Moon instead of what I had originally wanted.  This was a very nice gesture by management at Majerle's and something I didn't quite expect.  A commitment to your customers and to provide excellent service is always a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"This was a fun sports bar. The burgers and fries were good, drinks were cheap and there were a ton of tv's. Great place to watch the game with friends over good food and beverages. Good service and the bathrooms were clean which is important to me"}
{"text":"You'd think that when you make a reservation for 20 people, the restaurant would be prepared. Such was not the case. Only one server was assigned to our group. It was nearly 15 minutes before my drink order was taken. Twelve minutes later, tired of waiting, I walked up to the bar and bought a glass of wine. (A few minutes later, the server gave me the one I had originally ordered.) When the check came, she had charged me for both glasses of wine, even though I had paid for one of them at the bar.  The food was typical sports bar food, but not bad. My club sandwich was very good, but the fries (shoestring, crispy, flavorful) were barely warm. When most of us were nearly finished eating, the man next to me had to remind the server that he hadn't yet received his food. She quickly brought it out, saying, \"Sorry, 'bout that.\" Personally, I think his sandwich should have been comped, since the rest of us were finished while he was just beginning his meal.  BTW, the table was very sticky/dirty, as were the menus."}
{"text":"Aside from the miserable GM with a very sour facial expression, the salad was brown all over, each piece was old and wilted! The wings are delicious as usual as well as the potato skins.  So upon entering today I was greeted by an employee with a smile and warm hello... A great start. An angry looking gentleman walked by the bar slowly looking around & I asked if he was the manager (to compliment the person up front because as of late service has been RUDE. The response was a curt and rude \"yea\", so I asked \"do you have a quick moment?\" He responds with even more attitude & irritated \"yes.\" So at that point of course I say \"never mind you seem like it's a bad time.\" He then walked off (muttering under his breath) and proceeded to the back of the restaurant and clearly expressed something about me to the 3 waitresses that were in back. But honestly, there is no reason to go back because this is the type of service he thinks is ok to give paying valued customers.  Get a new GM, focus on service and lunchtime might get busy in there again one day!!!   I WILL be calling the corporate office about Mr. Miserable GM."}
{"text":"Nice pub and grill across from the ballpark. Highly recommend the jalape√±o burger and shoestring fries are out of this world. It gets packed before games so get there early or you'll have to sit bar side. Plenty of tvs and a great beer selection  big thumbs up from an out of towner."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to visit. It was crowded inside, but we sat outside next to the fire pit. We were the only ones enjoying our beers out side. The waiters came and moved the empty tables to make room for some game that you toss bean bags onto a board that has a hole in it. I guess you het points for making it on the hole  the throwers toss the bag 23 feet. So a romantic evening was cut short because we were having bean bags fly with in feet of our heads. Not cool to force us off the patio so drunks can play a game of toss the bean bag. Only bonus for this place is the ginormous receptionist who stands at 6'2 very attractive  We did order some Nachos cheese was not melted. Tasted good though   Ditch the bean bag game."}
{"text":"Barely 3 stars. The TVs and wait staff buoyed the rating. Not one of meals served to a group of seven were anything more than standard bar food. Come here to watch games with a crowd and drink some beers. Pass on the food."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a ball game. Comfortable. Cozy. Booths. Plenty of screens. More of an upscale sports bar. Not loud and wild. Friendly service. Will be back."}
{"text":"The bar was understaffed for the amount of people in the bar and restaurant so we had a hard time getting service since we sat at the bar. We ordered dinner - a burger, soup and salad. We won't order meals again. We have had the apps at the Phoenix location and were hoping all the food was as good but it wasn't. The burger and fries were bland, the soup was more like a dip it was so thick and the flavor was not there, the salad was a salad but the house dressing was much too vinegary. The atmosphere is nice and the music was good. They have a lot of TVs so I think it might be a nice place to catch a game."}
{"text":"Came here late in even in after delayed flight, rental car, and hotel check-in. Hostess said kitchen just closed (just after midnight), but if we got order in quick, they would handle it. Very good burger, my wife had pork sliders that she really liked. Friendly staff, and really appreciated keeping kitchen open for us.    Of course, seeing the Dan Majerle memorabilia was great, as Dan was a Cleveland fan favorite (although only for short time), as well as Phoenix. Would have been nice to see some Cleveland tie-in, especially in Goodyear where the Cleveland Indians spring training facility is and have lots of Cleveland fans there."}
{"text":"Ambiance is a bit sterile and simple. Service was excellent however and there was a good view of all the TVs regardless of where you sat. The pizza exceeded my expectations so overall not a bad casual hangout."}
{"text":"We went into your Goodyear restaurant to watch the Cubs game and celebrate our anniversary on 10-26-16 We were seated and waiting 15 minutes. No one helped us or even acknowledged us. We left and went across the parking lot to another restaurant."}
{"text":"I am here for the beer and to watch sports, the food is just OK. I really like a bar where the bartender asks your name and uses it."}
{"text":"My lunch partner and I went there last week after the traditional lunch rush, about 1:30 pm...not  my usual time to review a place as I would much rather see them under pressure and how they handle it.  This day was slow and the waitress was training a new server who was shadowing her.  Very pleasant, certainly cute and took our order without writing a thing down.  Impressive start.    There happens to be outdoor seating but based on the heat index, we opted for an indoor table.  Margaret had a house Margarita which happened to be on special, on the rocks with no salt.  I chose Iced Tea.  Both arrived quickly and were quite refreshing as it was 117 outside that day!!  Lunch was simple, I chose the Chili Pepper Garlic Gorilla Wings ($9.50) with celery and carrots and some blue cheese.  Margaret had a McKenzie Grilled Cheese Sandwich with a side of Fries from the kids menu ($5.00) and a cup of their Soup of the Day ($5.00)     The food arrived quickly and was almost 100%....with the exception of the Blue Cheese being Ranch (which I cannot stand) but was replace immediately when I told the waitress of the issue.  The french fries were outstanding, very hot, thin and very crisp and could not have been better.   All in all it was a nice outing.  Probably one of the better times to go there if you are not looking to view a sporting venue as the place was deserted by comparison to a late night weekend.  Conversation was easy as the noise level was low.    Monday through Friday there are awesome lunch specials with several choices each day.  The next time I head back there it will be for one of those, I am sure.    Bottom line:  Good food, great service, reasonable pricing.  Nice to see there are only 3 of these places in the valley and one is right near by!  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Place is ok. Came in a few times. Wings are good. Not really a fan of the sandwiches or burgers. Beer is always cold. Bartenders are always friendly."}
{"text":"I thought I'd stop by for a beer after too much holiday shopping and was completely disappointed. I cannot rate their food because I couldn't get served.  There were exactly 2 customers there and 5 employees couldn't be bothered to help me even though I was seated at the bar.  I'm a stickler for service, won't go back."}
{"text":"Best thing was the friendly service, hands down. Place was packed w/ NFL Bros yelling at the various TVs, but the servers were attentive and efficient. I didnt try the chow, but my friends/family average assessment was \"just okay\".  Due to our afternoon arrival, we got to sit outside. Patio area is weathered: chairs falling apart, 2 outdoor TVs w/ plastic covers that give off a beautiful glare if you like that sort of thing. Our booth had a thin film of desert dust covering it, which mandated a request for the hostess to have cleaned which she promptly took care of herself w/ a smile.  In spite of a friendly staff, I get the impression the manager and/or owner doesn't care much for this place.  Cheers! RS"}
{"text":"I ate here a few days ago and can't wait to go back. The make the BEST burgers ever & the staff is really friendly"}
{"text":"Had a French dip sandwich and cheese sticks delivered . Both are good. On time ? Hot and very tasty. Much better than going in where it's so loud you can't have a conversation"}
{"text":"This is a very average sports bar.   Strawberry chicken salad was tasty, but chicken was tough and over cooked and mixed greens had way too many browning pieces of lettuce. The candied pecans were delicious, though.   Sliders meat to bun ratio wasn't good. Too much bread. Although they grill the buns in butter to try to make up for it.   Thumbs up on the potato skins.   Service was reaaaaaaaaally slow, even though they weren't that busy."}
{"text":"Needed to cater food to girls volleyball team after a game - this place came through!   Great communication with staff and Anthony the manager.  Service to the car.  Girls were pleased.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Very above average food. Not your typical bar fare! Great atmosphere and the TV's rule!"}
{"text":"As a first-time customer to the establishment, I was looking forward to celebrating my boyfriend's birthday by taking him to watch the UFC fight, which they were featuring on pay per view.  My boyfriend and his buddy arrived early (about an hour before I did), just so he could be sure that we would have good seats (the ONLY thing he wanted for his birthday was to see this fight).  I made sure to let the server know that we were celebrating his birthday (discreetly, I wanted him to be surprised).  We ordered a round of drinks and appetizers; shortly thereafter two more friends joined us at our table.  After finishing our appetizers and a second round of drinks, we were approached by a different female server (or hostess), who asked us if we were staying to watch the fight and if so, we would have to pay $9 each.  We were startled because we were not informed of this (none of us, even though we arrived separately), but we obliged and asked that it be added to our checks.  About 5 minutes later, another staff member approached us and asked us if  we had paid to watch the fight (we told her yes and showed her our wristbands).  5 minutes later, yet a third staff member interrupted to ask if we had paid to watch.  At this point, we were beginning to get a bit ruffled because their tone was almost accusatory and we were paying customers.  The real kicker occurred when a security guard approached the table immediately after to inform us that our table had been reserved and that unfortunately we would have to move.  We were completely taken aback (we had ordered 2 rounds of drinks at this point, 2 appetizers, and were deciding on entrees--we were essentially mid-meal).  There were no \"Reserved\" signs on our table when we were seated (in fact, the table the security guy moved us to had the Reserved sign posted on it).  I found it ironic that they requested us to pay for our tickets multiple times AND THEN made sure to inform us that we would have to then move.  In all fairness, the table they moved us to wasn't in a terrible spot, but the one we had initially claimed was much better for viewing purposes (no craning our necks) and it was a roomier booth for the 4 of us.  That and the fact that I was trying to make it special for my boyfriend's birthday and thus far, the customer service had been less than stellar (no issues on the food side, however, the food was fantastic!).  It was more the lack of consideration/communication that detracted from what would have been an otherwise enjoyable experience.  We changed tables; at which point the servers cleared our waters (and two of the gals' soft drinks), after which we had to request more (when, in an ideal world, they should have been replenished immediately--I never did receive my water until after we had ordered our entrees and completely finished them (maybe I should have spoken up and said something sooner, but it's merely an observation, since I had already ordered a water to accompany my rounds of beer).  Same with the silverware and napkins--the staff cleared ours and when they made us change tables, then proceeded to serve us our meals with no utensils or napkins ( my boyfriend asked the runner, \"May we please have some silverware?\"  and she literally grabbed one set, placed it next to him and took off before he could explain that we all needed silverware).  Our female server was very sweet and asked us multiple times if there was anything else we needed, but my point is that due to the inconvenience of changing tables, we should not have to request the basic necessities for a second time when they were already on our table the first time around--it really took away from the experience.  At the end of the night, the tab for just my boyfriend and I totaled over $100 (there were 4 in our party, and the others spent a good deal on drinks and entrees as well).  The bottom line is that although this restaurant has excellent American-style food, we did not feel that our business was appreciated here and we would rather spend our time and money elsewhere.  As a side note,  they apparently don't do anything for birthdays as most establishments do--or they forgot--because it was never acknowledged by the staff, not even a \"Happy Birthday!\"  :-("}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, lousy music playing (my opinion) lots of televisions for sports viewing. Beer was cold, service was very good, I had a Majerle's Mom burger that was done perfectly on a fresh wheat bun.  It was delicious!  The wife had a Club sandwich with bacon on three of the pieces, so they need to do a better job on that. We would go back, just wished they played more main stream music!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, clean restaurant.  Also no one bothered me.  As a woman It's nice to come to a bar, eat, drink, and be left alone to relax.  Plus the bartenders are not tip hounds.  I got the EXACT same service as larger parties.  White collar women, this is the place after work to decompress!!!"}
