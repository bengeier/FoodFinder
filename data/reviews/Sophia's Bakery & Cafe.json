{"text":"As the first brunch location I have tried since moving to Madison, Sophie's kitchen provided a quaint and homey atmosphere. The food was delicious, but the wait was a little long. I would definitely recommend trying to get to the restaurant earlier in the morning to avoid a longer wait time. We were lucky enough to to enjoy our omelets in the outdoor seating area. Overall great place for brunch!"}
{"text":"This place epitomizes satisfying, home cooked breakfast.  Everything I've had here is extremely delicious.  While it's certainly the smallest restaurant I've ever been in if you're up for it you can make some new friends through sharing a table."}
{"text":"This place has really great breakfast food and is really fun to enjoy on the weekends. The tables are small, but everyone is really friendly and welcoming. Everyone should try this breakfast at least once if you live in Madison, but will probably end up going more than that!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE.  Never leave. Best pastries in town. The only thing I wish is that you were open more often."}
{"text":"The best brunch in Madison! The hours can be a bit weird, but (if they are open) the food is always delicious!"}
{"text":"I love going to Sophia's for breakfast.
However it is not a place to go if in a hurry and go early in the morning if you don't like being cozy with the person next to you.  Have never had a bad dish here and the ingredients are always quality."}
{"text":"I loved that they had outside seating, because after reading all the reviews how tiny the inside is I was a bit worried.
I personally had a hard time reading the menu, my friend simply described it as \" words everywhere\". 
Overall cute place, but because there wasn't anything on the menu which I really would like to eat ( I'm a picky eater) I would probably not return."}
{"text":"The place was a second resort. The first stop was at Mickey's. And lets say it was extremely packed!  So we headed over to Sophia's. After hearing so much about it, we had to stop by and give it a try. The atmosphere, as I feel was cramped. There's not much dining area without sharing a table with a stranger. Anyhow we ordered: Special waffles, Chorizo omelette and may I say that the omelette was excellent! It had a kick to it with all the spices within it. The waffles, it was crispy. Maybe the batter could of been a little sweeter, the strawberries really compliment the waffles. I would diffenitely come back, this place rocks! And not to mention bring with you some loot as this place do not accept credit cards!"}
{"text":"Great food!! I am a big fan of pancakes..they have one the best cottage cheese pancakes I have ever tried! My husband ordered black bean tacos, and he loved it!! We will be going back for those cottage cheese pancakes!"}
{"text":"I'll throw my hat into the ring for Sophia's.  This place is one of those miracles, that you kind of wonder how it exists or got so popular... such a tiny, hole in the wall, small business with no flash.  And then, you have their food, you sit in their cozy (read: borderline claustrophobic) restaurant, and you realize that Sophia's is one of those places everyone would LOVE to keep their little secret, but can't.  It's too good.  

Be prepared to wait, to share a table, and to be amazed."}
{"text":"New to Madison and went to trusty yelp for a great Sunday breakfast spot. I am unsure how this place is so well rated, and hasn't been shut down by a health inspector!! The food was average at best, had an omelette and pancakes and neither were good enough to make up for the horrible environment. Trying to create a shabby-chic and quaint space is fine, but that doesn't mean that you can slack on cleanliness. Everything was sticky, the spoons above where you order are coated in thick dust, and there were gnats swarming everywhere. Overall, it was an experience that I will not be having again!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I always get an omelet and a chocolate croissant, both of which I split half and half. It is just enough food for us. The price is very reasonable. I think this is the best breakfast restaurant in Madison. It is always very busy, but that is for a good reason. Only open on weekends until 2pm."}
{"text":"The best brunch place in Madison. Prepare to wait a bit but make friends with the people around you. It's totally worth the wait  though!"}
{"text":"I love it here even it's a tiny place--I think it adds characteristics to it! My roommates all loved whenever I bring Sophia's croissants coming back from church. and other brunch menus are equally delicious! :D 
One thing that makes me sad is that Sophia's is rarely open, at least when I was living in Madison or couldn't dine sometimes because of long line outside. But it's definitely worth a waiting!"}
{"text":"The smallest and most amazing breakfast place in town! My absolute favorite in Madison.

Warning - you may have to share the table with strangers, since there are only 4 tables there - but that is part of the charm here!

If you love hole-in-the-wall places that serve up other-worldly food (and I do :-)), this is the place for you! 

Made fresh to order with organic ingredients. Try their omelet specials, and save room for their pastries! Yummy! 

Go in the summer -you can sit in one of their tiny sidewalk tables and take in the sun while enjoying their amazing meal."}
{"text":"SOFIA'S IS OPEN FOR DINNER THURSDAY & FRIDAY NIGHT!!!!  Went there tonight and had chicken paprika with homemade noodles from some old world recipe.  Delish.  Also had their roasted eggplant, goat cheese, tapenade, roasted pepper & spinach sandwich.  Yummy, creamy goodness."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast. Veggie omelet with red & sweet potato home fries and yummy blueberry muffin. They don't offer toast, but who needs toast with their muffins and assorted baked goods! Bought a peach muffin to go. A must do in Madison. We parked our 24' motorhome on the street and didn't have to wait for a table about 9am saturday."}
{"text":"Overpaid for juice expecting something good and fresh, she literally pulled out a ocean spray bottle from the fridge right in front of me and poured it into the glass. I thought I was on candid camera. next time I'll save the cash and just go to copps for my \"fresh\" juice."}
{"text":"Probably the most unique restaurant I have eaten at in Madison. Basically the first floor of someone's house with a few community tables and three mini barstools overlooking the street. As nearly everyone has said, this place is cozy. 

As far as the food is concerned: I can confirm it is good! Those cottage cheese pancakes have notoriety for a reason... Super light and fluffy, with a slight tartness only enhanced by the raspberry preserves. They allow for half orders, so I opted for a half order of the plain buttermilk and half cottage cheese. For $8 I thought it was a very reasonable taste of the breakfast menu. I preferred the cottage cheese pancakes due to their uniqueness, but the buttermilk cakes were really tasty as well. 

The service is yet another high point: really friendly and welcoming folks working the register and cooking. They treat you like you are walking into their home, and seem to take pride in their food and service. 

Overall just a great place for an early weekend breakfast or late lunch. Only reason this place isn't higher ranked on Yelp is the lack of hours and seating. Loved it!"}
{"text":"What a lovely treasure!! This place is only open a couple days a week last time I checked (weekends?) and it is oh-mazing. I can't believe how good the food was, it's like the best breakfast food in town, especially if you like a home-y feel."}
{"text":"Thank goodness more people don't know about Sophia's (or don't wake up early enough to eat there), but I fear the word is spreading!  It's already too popular for its own good (size), so you should try to arrive when/before they open to get a seat.  Everything you could order would be delicious.  I used to down a gargantuan breakfast at Sophia's and then I would order pastries (croissant, coffee cake, etc.) to go - joy!  The owner/staff were all really friendly and made me want to support this local business regularly."}
{"text":"I've never seen a place so small in my life. It is beyond quaint and just plain ridiculous. When you walk in they just look at you dumbfounded.  A \"restaurant\" that is actually not even that busy but so small that they can't even get to you is a major problem. And what are they doing serving such large parties. One table took up 1/3 of the whole place. It was nothing but mass disorganization. I'd love to comment on the food, but I can't even imagine how people get to it."}
{"text":"I really like Sophia's. The pastries and the food is all delicious. I love to stop in for a muffin or a croissant and take them home, because the restaurant is super-small.  I love Sophia's when I'm one of the first people in the place, before it gets really crowded. Go early, and make sure you get some pastries to take home with you, because you'll think about them later.

I would probably give Sophia's 4.5 stars if that was an option, because sometimes they leave things to be desired, but the food is just THAT good. I've eaten-in at Sophia's a few times, to varied results: I wouldn't come here with a hangover or if you are extremely hungry, because the wait can be really long and the restaurant can get really crowded really quickly. I think the inside seats like 16 people, to give you an idea.  

The food is really amazing, though, which makes the wait worthwhile."}
{"text":"Visiting from SF.  Checked yelp and found this place.  It is very small -- a converted house.  As you sit in it you can watch the kitchen.  The food was excellent.  We had an eggplant/red pepper omelet and peach waffles.  The waffles were light and fluffy with fresh whipped creme.

We got pastries to go, which were also good, in particular the chocolate croissant was unique.

Great place for an informal breakfast."}
{"text":"A favorite weekend breakfast in Madison.  Omelets are superb -- buttery, and not too dry -- but the absolute best are the blintzes.  Oh, my.  It's a good thing Sophia's isn't any closer to home.

As others have noted: it's a pretty tiny place.  Come early, don't bring a large group, and expect to share a table.  If that's part of the fun for you, great!  If not, well... come for the cooking anyway."}
{"text":"I love coming here for brunch on the weekends. The breakfast tacos are great. The baked goods are great. 

The only thing to warn people about it how seating and paying works. I joke that getting a table can be a contact sport but everyone is willing ot share a table and it all works out. I've walked out of there and got a block away and realized I hadn't payed but they were sweet about it."}
{"text":"It is my honest opinion that IF god exists, and IF s/he chose to open a restaurant that it would be Sofia's.  Perfection from every angle, plus eating here just makes me unspeakably happy."}
{"text":"Just had the most disappointing breakfast ever at this place.  I knew I shouldn't have bought into the Madison hype.  This city doesn't know good food at all and Sophia's just proves it.

Before I get to the food, let me describe what you are getting into.  It's in an annoying location on Johnson with no convenient parking.  But fine, a little walk won't kill us.  Then you get there and it's a tiny place with mismatched tables and chairs crammed together.    It's loud and uncomfortable as you jockey for a seat with other patrons and maneuver around them to serve yourself some water or clear your own table.  I wouldn't be surprised if the place should be shut down by the fire marshal. Oh and they only accept cash which is an increasingly obnoxious practice in a mostly cashless society.

Now onto the food.  In one word: abysmal.  The couldn't cook a pancake or a waffle to save their life.  Eggy and probably made with batter that was overwhipped.  We can whip up better waffles at home with ease and Bisquick has churned out better pancakes.  The waffles had pear ginger fruit on top, but neither of us like the flavor and they decided to drown it in a huge amount of whip cream.  I guess that was an attempt to hide the mediocrity of the food under it.  The pancakes had decent cinammon apples on top, but the apples in the pancakes were bland and neither of us could detect the cider reduction that supposedly accompanied it.

I think the worst condemnation of it was that both of us left hungry because we left at least half of our breakfasts on the plate.  Yes, it was that bad.  Also you can shove your tip jar up your ass.  The gall of asking for tips when I have to fight for a table, get my own drinks and clean up my own food?"}
{"text":"I would give the cottage cheese pancakes 4 stars. But the egg dishes left much to be desired. I got the egg and cheese croissant and the eggs had been cooked within an inch of their life. They were horribly overcooked and bland, and I suspect the cheese was that lifeless, flavorless cheese known as American."}
{"text":"Nice variety of dishes-new & different things in addition to breakfast standards. Went for Sunday brunch & space is very tight which took away some from the atmosphere when you're getting bumped repeatedly. Be open to sharing a table with other guests, too--which is fine with me generally. (Ok the loud young women detailing their relationship statuses got old--much more peaceful when they left!). Would definitely eat there again though!"}
{"text":"I will never forget this single breakfast experience in Madison. It was awesome.

Yes, it is crowded and you have to sit with other groups at the large tables. Yes, you have to pay cash. Yes, it seems like you are eating breakfast in your grandmother's kitchen. But, seriously, I like my grandmother's kitchen. It is quite the experience and totally worth the perceived hassle. The coffee was fresh and dark, the chocolate croissant was to die for, and the fruit covered french toast made from croissants was sinful.

If I ever find myself in Madison again, I will definitely go out of my way to return to this little gem of a breakfast nook."}
{"text":"This place is legend in Madison. Everyone talks about it, raves, about it, but few people have been there due to the odd hours. I finally lucked out today and got there when the cafe was open, and I found out everything I've heard about the place is true.

It is small, only four tables; the kitchen is bigger than the dining area. I got there early to ensure a seat. However, I might have come too early, because the cafe itself didn't seem to be ready. All of the staff were busy getting the bakery ready as people walked through the door asking for coffee cake and chocolate croissants, and most customers had to wait for the first batch to come out of the oven. 

I waited quite a bit for my breakfast, considering I was the third person in the door. I had the waffles and they were fantastic, and I heard positive exclamations from the other diners digging into there food. I am glad I finally got to Sophia's. I am delighted this small shop with just weekend hours has such lasting power. But next time, I might stop in a little later and get my bakery to go."}
{"text":"Sooooooo good. Tiny place with community tables. Cottage cheese pancakes with raspberry sauce were a real treat. Everything on the board looked good, so I'm definitely planning on coming back. Quick & efficient & friendly service even at a busy time."}
{"text":"Small place, mamma pappa type place but it is so cozy and beautiful!! You have to try out!! Food is awesome, fresh and hot!! I dont like coffe that much but this coffe they have here i looooved it, the aroma was great!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a native of Madison nor went to school here, but every time I visit I NEED to go here.

Best breakfast I've ever had. You can't go wrong with any omelette selection and their pastries are out of this world. Specifically, the chocolate croissants and cinnamon rolls. Bacon= Delicious. Chocolate Chip Pancakes = Heaven

Be aware that you are most likely going to have to share a table, but it's all part of the experience."}
{"text":"Is it cramped? Yes. Can you be assured of a leisurely breakfast without feeling rushed to give up your seat? This is not likely. However, I have found that the best time to go to Sophia's is after 1 pm (they close at 2) when you can almost always find a seat and sit as long as you like (they do not kick you out promptly at 2!). This is my Sophia's strategy and if you hate being rushed or being forced to squish around a small table, try it.

As others have said the food is fantastic. I've never had an omelet so fluffy."}
{"text":"Sophia's has by far the city's best brunch. It manages to have a dedicated following, despite only being open on Saturdays and Sundays and being the size of a walk-in closet.

Caveat: if you hate small spaces and hate having to share tables with others, and if you hate having to fight for seating, do not eat here! In my experience, the people who have negative feelings about this restaurant always have them because of the space, not the food. The restaurant is also sweltering in summer. 

My favorite thing to order at Sophia's, actually the only thing I tend to order because i'm addicted to it, is the egg and cheese croissant. It is delicious. You can get it with bacon. It comes with a plentiful serving of fruit (and the earlier you get to Sophia's, the better the fruit is, as they tend to run out of the good stuff). 

The omelets also tend to be delicious. The baked goods are stellar.

If I were going to deduct stars for this place, it would be for a couple of things:

-The ordering policy is really stupid considering what rigmarole there is to get seating in this small, crowded restaurant. You stand in line to order, then fight for seating, and then in order to pay, you have to go up to the counter again. Tip: do not wait in line again! Stand to the left, and the counter person will take your money. 

-The second thing is more particular. I had always thought Sophia was committed to local/sustainable foods. I recently asked where the bacon comes from, and it is factory farm meat. I now question the origin of the eggs as well, though Sophia's is one of the few restaurants in town that uses real eggs in all of the dishes, and not Sysco egg product."}
{"text":"The game plan for this place is usually to party all night and get here after storming the Farmer's market while it's still being set up. Then eat a ton and go home and have a nap. 
You know how you hate that most food that you get when you eat out is the carbs and not the fruits/veggies/meat? Not here. And that is why it's awesome.

THIS IS HOW WE DO IT."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast/brunch place in town!

I'm so sad to hear they are closing, \"for real\" this time.

We have gotten almost everything on the menu from their sweet crepes to their omelets. The menu is almost leaning on the side of vegetarians, but there is a chorizo omelet which is always a solid choice.

Their bakery items are top notch, you can see them come out of the piping hot oven from their open kitchen.

Remember it's cash/check only!

Grab some baked goods and freeze them before they're gone forever! :'o("}
{"text":"Holy smokes, I've never been to a more over-rated restaurant!

I went with one other person on a Sunday at about 1 pm. The place wasn't remotely crowded, so I'm not just annoyed that I had to stand in line or share a table or something.

Menu: I guess from the reviews and the ambiance I expected this place to have food that was fresh or seasonal or something? Nope. It was November and the omelets featured asparagus and tomatoes. Ew.

Service: Non-existant. It was actually kind of funny how whenever someone walked up to the counter to order, the woman looked totally surprised to be interacting with a customer and had to look around for a piece of paper to write on. There were 8 customers and 4 employees while we were there. You'd think with a ratio like that, you'd see something get accomplished. Wrong. Here are some things I watched the cook do while we waited and waited and waited for our food: look around for a plate like she'd never been in this kitchen before, make breakfast for 2 other employees, send a text message, use the bathroom.  Look, I slack off on my job sometimes too, but if you're going to have an open kitchen, you need to make an effort to look busy, or else the customers feel like they've been waiting even longer than they actually have.

Food: Barely mediocre. Both of our meals were lukewarm and seemed like they'd been sitting around a while. Potatoes were well below greasy-spoon average and completely unseasoned. The blueberry pancakes were undercooked to the point of being gross. We only didn't send them back because it had taken 20 minutes to get them in the first place. 

Never again, Sophia's. The rest of you people can enjoy standing in line for bad food. I'll be at 4&20 or Madison Sourdough."}
{"text":"If you can get in the door...go! Go immediately. Everything here is good. Literally, everything.

Cute little neighborhoody spot with excellent homemade food. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"Very tasty, homey, friendly - wonderful start for a Sunday morning. You can even sit in the sun outside while you enjoy your food."}
{"text":"So good! I'd give Sophie's 5 stars except it's only open on weekends, is uncomfortably small & they only take cash. Their bake goods are amazing!"}
{"text":"Best waffle in town and lovely employees."}
{"text":"I think this place thinks it is cooler than it is, which is why they give you snark at the counter, don't take card, don't have coffee refills, make you bus your own table, and don't take out dill from the omelets. (Tangent: who the fucks like dill? Really? It's so, so awful why would you ruin what looked like a perfect mushroom/asparagus omelet with dill?) I realize the restaurant is small, but only having a premade omelet mix? Really? Pastries were good, but not heavenly. Is it really that hard to do a great croissant? 

To improve: 
1. Be nicer to customers. 
2. Allow substitutions on omelets. 
3. Take card, I'm sorry it's 2013 time to ditch cash only everyone knows it's just to under declare your income anyway. 
4. Bus tables. You are a restaurant, not a coffee shop."}
{"text":"My, is this place wonderful.  Perhaps I'll write more later.  But in bullet points:
-everything fresh and made from scratch
-creative dishes
-great for vegetarians
-communal seating
-everything is delicious
-ecclectic decor

I was in Madison for a weekend in January '14.  It was so good I came here to eat breakfast both mornings I was in town.

You want to have a place like Sophia's right around the corner from you.  Admit it."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast in a super cozy environment!  Honestly, this could be the best breakfast spot in Madison.  Be sure to bring cash though.

Walked in, chose a table with some available seats, and went back to the counter to order.  It's pretty cool to see the entire kitchen and the array of pastries on sale; the cashier herself was also super friendly. 

I ordered the cottage cheese pancakes, and my BF ordered the grilled ham and leek omelette.  Both were absolutely amazing!  Super fluffy and light, with raspberry sauce adding the right amount of sweetness for me.  The omelette had a great mix of salty and sour from the dill, and was amazing and delicious.  The prices were also very reasonable.  

Given the coziness of the environment and the food, I can't recommend this place highly enough!"}
{"text":"Since I live about 4 blocks away, I've stopped by Sophia's on many a weekend morning to grab a croissant, sticky bun, slice of cake, etc. to go. Their pastries are fantastic. Their croissants are flaky, buttery, savory...in short, proper. 

I had never had an actual sit-down experience until last weekend, because, frankly, I had been intimidated. It's such a tiny space, and it's always been jam-packed, with people waiting outside to have a spot to sit and eat. I've seen people in warmer months sitting outside on chairs with plates on their laps for lack of tables. 

My boyfriend and I got lucky last Saturday and beat the rush. There were actually TWO free tables when we decided to actually sit down for breakfast. 

Some highlights:

-AMAZING coffee. And it's a refill-yourself kind of system, which I love. 
-Croissant sandwich with ham, cheddar, and fig compote was to die for. Sweet, savory, salty...YUM. 
-Omelette with chorizo and mushrooms was super savory and rich. Delish."}
{"text":"Went to the dells this past weekend and we were craving some breakfast on our way back to Chicago. We looked up places on Yelp and found this cute spot that had fabulous reviews. It's looks family owned. The services was great it did take a little long to recieve our food put it was so good. I had the banana nut waffle. And the potatoes were to die for."}
{"text":"This was a cozy environment with a quaint home kitchen feel right down to the mismatched plates and mugs. There food was delicious and very reasonably priced. I had a croissant sandwich, which came with a bountiful supply of fruit, including pomegranate, pineapple and pear- what a great breakfast experience!"}
{"text":"Good food but, as always, very crowded.  I wish they'd open for bakery service during the week and use the profits to expand the seating area."}
{"text":"4 out of 5 stars due to the physical logistics of the space alone. otherwise 5 stars. the food is always fresh & tasty. the bakery is delish! if it wasn't such a frustrating & cramped place to get a table and eat at - it would be perfect."}
{"text":"Finally, i made my way into this top selection on Yelp Madison's homepage.

Delightful, cozy spot for comfort food. I can't say that it is my favorite brunch place in town, but the great vibe of communal tables, pastries, homely decorations and comfort food will definitely bring me back another day. 

It is a small place, probably fits only 15 people at a time; there's not much place to even stand and wait, but luckily, customers are all aware of Sophia's popularity and get out as soon as they get done. So yes, big groups of old time friends, bring your conversations to nearby cafes like Johnson Public House or elsewhere. 

Pay in cash or check, and pay when you're done. I was really puzzled why the receptionist left after I gave my order. Why didn't she want my $$?! 

Indeed, as predicted by Yelp reviews, croissants are a great get at Sophia's. However, despite the great buttery flavor, they are not as crispy as I would like. I would say no on the croissant french toast, as much as it sounds awesome. The soft croissant texture just makes the french toast too soggy. The cherry sauce was really good though!

I also got the ham and cheese croissant, with the fig sauce on the side. I wasn't keen on the fig sauce. It was good, but too sweet for my savory taste buds. Again, I wished the croissant might be toasted or pan fried, cos it was kinda soft. But the generous serving of melted cheese and delicious ham slices were enough to make up for the not as favorite croissants. Potatoes were alright, i wish they were more flavorful. The apple slices or fruit bowl makes me feel extra healthy!

I will be back, to try the chocolate croissants or other pastries. THEY ARE GIGANTIC and look like they can feed 2 or more. And the chocolate croissant looks more crispy. And maybe omelette or pancake next time. Sophia's bakery makes you feel like you are coming home or at a bed and breakfast - relaxing and pleasant."}
{"text":"Great food!  Cozy little place.  Always seems to be busy but thats because its a hot spot.  East side stapel"}
{"text":"The chocolate crossaints are made differently here. More chocolate and less fluffy, but still very yummy.

Come in early by 9:30  to beat the crowd. By 10 the place is usually pack and there will be a wait.

I like the breakfast selection. 

This joint has a cafe next door feel to it."}
{"text":"Small place with a lot of big tables jammed in.  You will most likely be sharing your table with other people.  You pay after you've eaten, which is strange since you order at the counter.  The food takes a long time to get. 

Despite the negatives, it is one of my favorite places to go for brunch.  The food is always excellent, and this place deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"My bf and I came here for brunch, and we found the experience unimpressive and below average. 

I got the cherry crepes and he got the bacon egg crossiant. The cherries in my dish were so sour that I couldn't taste the crepe, powdered sugar, whipped cream, or syrup; I may as well have been eating a can of fermented cherries (without the alcohol, unfortunately). Definitely not worth $7.50. The bite I took of the $9 crossiant sandwich was dry; the crossiant part wasn't flaky or crispy and the eggs tasted like cardboard. The bacon was fine, but there wasn't enough of it to make up for the rest. We also got some hot chocolate, which tasted like the cheap grocery store kind (that I have sitting in my cupboard and could've made better for much less)....

The place itself is small and cramped, with some four tables and chairs crowded around each. There was only one spot with two empty, adjacent chairs when we went to sit down, and it was across from three rather loud gossips who had finished their meal long ago. We got to hear all about their snooty disregard for x, y, and z, as well as their impromptu contest for worse singer. Sitting at any of the other tables probably would've only been a little better; everyone seemed to huddle together to isolate themselves and not interact outside their little groups. (It reminded me of those family reunions where half the family had disowned the other half and refused to acknowledge their presence at the dinner table.)

Anyway, not sure how a place like this got such rave reviews, but it was a terrible experience and we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"It had been years since I had dined at Sophia's. No good reason. We arrived around 9 and there were quite a few seats available. We shared a portobella, Gorgonzola omelet and grilled potatoes as well as a generous slice of a cherry sour cream cake. I had coffee and my partner had tea. Everything was absolutely delicious. The omelet was light and fluffy with a creamy fillings. the potatoes were charred just as I like them. The cake was moist  and not overly sweet. All and all a perfect meal. Towards the end of our stay we were joined by a lovely couple which only served to enhance the experience. I plan to return to Sophia's again soon."}
{"text":"I'm writing this 5-star review mainly because the current 4.5-star average doesn't do this place justice!  There are already enough other reviews to convince you that Sophia's has DELICIOUS food - both the bakery items and the prepared entrees.  Yes, it's only open weekends, and yes, the place is tiny and you very well may have to share your table with a stranger.  But that's all part of the charm!"}
{"text":"Visiting my son in Madison, used Yelp! Reviews to choose Sophia's.  Thank you for honest reviews.  Ordered at counter, selected seat outside beautiful day 60 degrees and sunny, choose my coffee cup help myself to coffee as many times as I wanted, enjoyed conversation while we waited for the wonderful food.  It was like we were eating with friends.  Customers sit at any open chair, table sharing is the norm here.  Had the Croissant French Toast added strawberries and my son had the banana pancakes with real maple syrup.  Fresh OJ.  This is a great place to spend time relaxing enjoying conversation and great food.  We bused our table at the end.  You pay after eating before leaving Cash or Check only no CC. Stop in and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Sohpia's is as good as it gets for breakfast and brunch in Madison!

Classic near-east side Madison look (early 20th Century period), the tiny store front, makes Sophia's character unforgettable on its own. But the owner, the staff, being able to see right into the kitchen from the order counter is fun! Especially for a breakfast lover like me.

Colectivo Coffee is serve yourself with one refill included, so ration yourself accordingly fellow java jivers! You're welcome.

Homemade coffee cakes, ricotta pancakes, omelettes overflowing with yummly local veg and meats, tasty spuds. My breakfast list overfloweth!! You. CANNOT. GO. WRONG. If you're in the company of others in your breakfast party, sharing is highly recommended. Heck, share with the stranger sitting down the table...you will be fast friends!

Sophia's food and character makes up for the tiny space and seating. If this bugs you, stop. Don't be a grumpy-puss, crankypants There's maybe 5 seats at the window bench, which is fun for people-watching, two larger  tables and one smaller table inside, and when the weather cooperates, a few round patio tables outside. Showing up earlier is a better idea if you don't like waiting, grumpy-puss. Grab a coffee or tea and settle down. Hug someone. Laugh a little. Smell a lot (of the amazing food). Eat too much. Go to Sohpia's."}
{"text":"My brunch buddy and I have tried other brunches in the area, but after a few that just didn't live up to Sophia's quality and taste, we gave up searching and come here nearly every weekend. 

The omelets are always made with inventive combinations of veggies, herbs, and cheese; the ingredients are consistently amazingly fresh. The baked goods are nothing short of magical (I can never leave without trying at least one), the coffee is always hot, and all the pancakes I've tried have blown me away. Seriously, I can think of no reason not to go here for brunch on the weekends. I just wish it was open all week.

And yes, it's tiny, but once you sit down with a scone and a cup of coffee to wait for your food, you don't even notice. The size is good for me, because instead of bringing all my friends at once to support Sophia's, I have an excuse to come back over and over, to bring them in ones and pairs!"}
{"text":"I am giving a low rating because I LOVE & HATE Sophias

LOVE: THE FOOD
Pastries: super good, not too expensive
Food: good but pricey 

HATE: DO NOT TAKE A CARD!
I would go every weekend but I can't because they do not take a card. They need to start taking a card, its 2013. My bank charges crazy high charges at atms. I have lived here for over 10 years. They would be rich from all the food I would have bought if they took cards. 
HATE: ATMOSPHERE/SIZE 
very,very, very small space don't go there to eat! Get it to go. You will feel cramped,rushed and claustrophobic 
HATE: SERVICE 
not very nice or polite, i always feel like I am inconveniencing them"}
{"text":"The place sits around 15 people, and it has a cozy feel. It's cash only and since we only brought $10 we ordered a slice of the blueberry coffee cake and two cups of coffee. The coffee was good and the coffee cake was perfection - a layer of berries, a creamy center, and a fluffy crust."}
{"text":"Awesome food, and super friendly staff. 

Checked out what fellow yelpers had to say about Sophia's and all sounded pretty great. So we stopped in and gave it a try!

So I'll just say I do think this place is a bit disorganized, as to the placement of everything and the whole process of ordering, seating, and getting your drinks. 

Walked in and there was a huge line, people just kinda standing everywhere.  Once you walk in you realize how tiny of a restaurant it is. But...it's cozy, loved the interior. While you're waiting in line you can look up on to the wall at the menu to try and decide on what you want from all the amazing sounding choices.  Once to the counter you put your order in, and then the wait continues. There are approximately 4 tables, and one little bar area with stools along the window.  And when you're there at a 11:30 on a Sunday morning, you can imagine the wait we had. And when I said this place is tiny...it's tiny. There is really no good place to stand while people are trying to grab their coffee, or water, or go to the bathroom, or put their dishes away. 

Once we finally got to table, we put our name in, and took in the atmosphere a bit more.  I will say...I think it's a pretty neat idea to have 'Group Tables' so you're sitting with strangers, and get to make some good conversation with someone new! 

Once our food came, I was pleased with the presentation of my meal. I ended up getting the 'Grandma's Sweet Cheese Blintzes' and oh my where they good! A bit different I couldn't pin point what they reminded me of. But the sweet yet, sour/bitter filling, and the light syrup on top, all paired so well."}
{"text":"the most heavenly brunch everrrrrrrrr. sophia's is that cool artist girl that everyone has a mini-crush on b/c she's soooooooooo incredibly sweet. sure, a little on the absent-minded side but she has such infectious enthusiasm for life that all your hair-brained poor life choices totally seem feasible. ahhh heart heart heart!

also. what is with the dbag writing a review w/o eating here? stop hating FIB!"}
{"text":"OVERRATED.

I made my way over here on a Sunday afternoon to see what this buzz was all about. And really, there was no way Sophia's could have ever lived up to the hype. The way people were talking about it, I expected to fall out of my chair in some kind of taste-induced seizure. What I got was a pretty standard brunch, in a pretty uncomfortable chair positioned awkwardly on the curb, 5 feet from trucks and mopeds hurling by and drowning out my conversation.

I do remember the croissant & cheese being excellent, but I can hardly even recall what else I ate - never a good sign. The black bean tacos were good in the sense that they were authentic, but they were seriously lacking something to give it a little more flavor. Juice was not really that outstanding. Potatoes were just...potatoes. Nothing about them that made them special. All in all, I had a pretty decent meal for an an acceptable price. I just fail to see why I should pick it over Marigold or Sunroom or any other place that has a respectable dining room.


You don't exactly look like you're lacking in a fan base right now, so why is it that you can't put a little more money into this place? Sophia's is every wannabe hipster's wet dream, and East Johnson isn't exactly the most diverse neighborhood in Madison. As for me, I don't much enjoy eating in an establishment whose every aspect of outward appearance and service indicates that it thinks it's better than me. 



I'm much reminded of The Oatmeal's \"how to make a restaurant insanely popular in a big city.\" And based off of the Sophia's model, I've decided to put a little guide together that works specifically for Madison. See you on the cover of Forbes.

1. Only accept cash. If your customer asks whether you accept credit, look at them as if they just asked you for a milkshake made of liquefied puppies.

2. Pick a ridiculously small venue that could not possibly accommodate the amount of customers you have. Make them wait in a line out the door to get their food, and have them fight over and share what little table space there is. This will give everyone the impression that they need you, not that you need them.

3. Keep your restaurant open for 10 hours a week, it maximizes the lines. Open and shut your doors so quickly that you'll be the envy of every bank and post office in town.

4. Air conditioning in 100-degree weather is for pussies who think a restaurant owes them something. Your customers are only giving you their money, not their first-born children.

5. 45-60 minutes is not an unreasonable amount of time for them to wait for your food. Delicious food takes time. So what if every upscale five-star restaurant in town can get a full meal on the table in the duration of twenty minutes?

6. If there are 4 customers in the front waiting to place their orders, and an interesting conversation going on in the back, remember where your priorities lie. That cheese plate appetizer that's been sitting there for the last 25 minutes will still be a cheese plate if you bring it out with the main course.

So if you like your breakfast as pretentious as you like your music, your clothes, and your one-gear bicycle, you're going to fucking love Sophia's."}
{"text":"Oh Sophia's... my only regret is not having discovered you earlier. 

I woke up early (10:30ish) on a Saturday morning just to try your coveted brunch, and boy am I glad I did.

We got here at roughly 11 and were immediately treated to a battle of aromas. Savory scents blended with sweet fragrances, and made our decisions that much harder.
 
After internally debating with myself for a while, which was convenient, because you will most likely encounter a line and it will most likely be long; I was able to settle on a choice when it came to my turn to order.

I ordered their Croissant French Toast with raspberry sauce, which was absolutely beautiful. I didn't even need to instagram it! That's how delicious it looked. 

The French toast was cut up into bite sized pieces, with pureed raspberry sauce drizzled over the top, all sprinkled with powdered sugar. 

My fork cut through the warm toast like butter, and the soft pieces of dough practically melted in my mouth. I loved the soft consistency, because it soaked up the sauce so much easier.  The raspberry sauce itself wasn't too sweet, which is definitely a plus, as the powdered sugar will more than satisfy your sweet tooth. If that's not enough, you could always ask for freshly made syrup :) 

Oh, and all of this came out to like $8. I'm kind of disappointed that I will have to start waking up earlier on weekends now, but at least I won't be going hungry!"}
{"text":"Hour and a half wait for an egg sandwich and pancakes (AFTER we ordered). I wish I was joking. Would have left except we elected to pay when we ordered. Definitely don't recommend paying until you get your food."}
{"text":"LOVE Sophia's.  They have the best waffles, ever.  Love the crepes and pancakes as well.  It's a fabulous, unpretentious place!  Everything is fresh and so tasty."}
{"text":"Sophia's is delicious. It's a tiny little hole in the wall that you might miss if a line hasn't formed outside. You might be able to score a seat inside, but you'll definitely be sharing a table with other people because space is at a premium.

I ordered a ham and cheese croissant with fig tapenade, potatoes and apple slices. My friend got some black bean and avocado tacos, which were amazing and the tortillas were toasty. Another friend got the croissant french toast, which came with a delicious tart raspberry sauce. I don't think you could order the wrong thing here. We were so full that we had no room for pastries, but I'll definitely be stopping by to try some in the future.

Oh, and the decor is adorable. Take a look around because there are some interesting pieces inside!

Cash only!!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast I have had in Madison!!!! I can't imagine they open only on the weekends. We had 2 different omelettes with their home made croissant and a blueberry banana pancake. Everything we ate was wonderful. Their baked goods look to good to pass so we took home a blueberry muffin, cheese cake pie and a coffee cake. So glad we did. Can't wait to go again!!!!!! A must go for every breakfast lover."}
{"text":"I went here a few years back while on a business trip. I loved this little place. The food was fantastic and the crowd was awesome. Places like this is the reason that I have debated on moving to Madison. I can't really remember what I had exactly but I was mismerised with waffles and crepes."}
{"text":"Tried a variety of sweet and savory options and everything was lovely. Seating is tight so small parties share tables creating a nice neighborly feel. Recommend."}
{"text":"Cute little place with a really cute idea about how to make food.  I appreciate the attention to detail and the thoughtful approach to a food experience.   

The experience was really dampened by the tapenade on my ham and cheese croissant.   The flavor was so strong and so contrasting to the other flavors present.  It overpowered the entire croissant and I ended up just not eating the side of the croissant with the tapenade.  The rest of the meal was great and fresh.  It doesnt make sense to me to have such a strong sauce/spread on a devastatingly tasty homemade croissant.  Next time, I will change my order accordingly, but overall I question the taste of their pairing decisions.  This is a bakery (it is in the name), so let the baked good be the star, not some spread that people will either love or hate!

May be back, not sure."}
{"text":"The concept of this place is super cute! Squish together at a table next to people you don't (or do) know. Order homey, comforting food. I'd recommend getting any of their sweet stuff--pancakes, blintzes, coffee cakes. Their potatoes are pretty awesome too. The black bean tacos and omelettes are good, but they are also easy to make at home. 

I'll probably be back sometime soon."}
{"text":"I lived a block away for 4 years and visited the place twice I believe, once for take out and the other intending to eat there, which is saying something as I like to frequent my neighborhood places.  Food is decent, had a nice waffle.  But Madison has a lot of excellent breakfast/brunch places (Lazy Janes, Manna are within biking distance and come immediately to mind) that might be a slight headache to get a table at but are nowhere near as much trouble as Sophias.  My wife and 'Is verdict were the same, fine food but so very not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"cute tiny place. delicious breakfast."}
{"text":"OK, it's nice for a room to be about 90 degrees if you're doing yoga. Not when you're trying to eat breakfast while crammed into a corner with a bunch of really pretentious hipsters breathing down your neck. LITERALLY breathing on your neck. That's how small this place is. I won't complain about the quality of the food but they did forget to bring me what I ordered. 
Anyway, if you don't like hipsters, and you are in NO WAY claustrophobic (which I am not but in here I felt like I could be), try it out."}
{"text":"Sophia, I still want to have your baby.

I'm not the kind of person who enjoys sitting with strangers and making small talk but, if you put a plate of anything on Sophia's menu in front of me, I will shut up and take it like a man.

Err....yeah."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, love the atmosphere of sitting and dining with neighbors and meeting new people."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Wish it was open more days out of the week. Try the cottage cheese pancakes and the omelets. The cottage cheese is mixed into the batter and topped with boysenberries."}
{"text":"Overally, a totally great experience! We did not experience much of a line. We ordered a chocolate croissant and sat down with some tea. The croissant was heavenly! Perfect buttery croissant, with creamy, rich chocolate inside. I got the cottage cheese pancakes with boysenberries, and they were super delicious. The cottage cheese gave the pancakes a different, good texture, and the combo with the boysenberries was perfect. The atmosphere felt very home-like, which I liked. I also liked being able to see into the kitchen. The \"spoon curtain\" was also cool."}
{"text":"Great experience. Went to Sophia's this morning for breakfast with my mom. We split a huge croissant breakfast sandwich filled with egg, sharp cheddar, and bacon. This came with a side of fresh fruit which included mango, watermelon, oranges, cantaloupe, and grapes. We also got a side of their olive oil breakfast potatoes and finished with a small pastry (which we took most of home because we were so full). A TON of food for $17. Everything was super delicious. Staff was friendly. Really cute little place. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"No time to write much here. I was in Madison for Ironman 2010, and I went there with a woman that I was having a fantastic weekend with. We found Sophia's via Yelp, and the reviews encouraged us to try it out. The first thing that hits you when walking in are the amazing smells. The whole cafe is a delight to the senses. The food was wonderful, with great options. It's the sort of place where you hate having to choose just one dish, and you want to come back as soon as possible to try something else. The people were very friendly, both the staff and the people in the restaurant. I hate the fact that I don't live in Madison so I can't go there again anytime soon."}
{"text":"It's frustrating that this place is only open for breakfast on the weekends and that there isn't more seating indoors. However, operating on a small scale and strictly on its own terms allows Sophia's to truly excel at being, for a couple of days every week, by far the best breakfast experience in Madison. The pastries are outstanding and there's a different selection each time. I usually go with one of the omelette specials, all of which are made with fresh, locally sourced ingredients. This place makes living in Madison worthwhile."}
{"text":"I had their ham and cheddar croissant for breakfast yesterday, and if I could pencil it in for lunch again today, I would. Probably for the rest of the week, for that matter. No toughness at all to the ham and melty cheese on a fresh-baked croissant with a fig tapenade that's the real showstopper. You probably haven't yearned for fig on a hot ham and cheese, but it's damn tasty.

Be ready for a communal dining experience. The tables are close together, and it seemed like a lot of people knew each other. We would up sharing a table with a couple that came in behind us just because the place is so tiny. I enjoyed that aspect, but I can see how it'd be a drawback for some."}
{"text":"I usually don't like brunch, I don't get it, not my meal. However, I quite enjoyed this place, very cute, and I thought their food was above bar.

I had an omelette with veggies and some nice side of potatoes. The dish was well executed, tasty, and very light. I topped with a chocolate croissant that was good, but not great.
The owner is very friendly.

The downsides: eternal waiting time, not so clean kitchen, cash only. Not sure I will go back, but I heard it is closing soon anyway."}
{"text":"I just came here for the pastries and they were good. They had about 7 different items in the case, and it was hard to choose because they all looked yummy! The interior of Sophia's is very small and it can be a challenge to it get in someone's way. Seating is very limited too, a suggestion would be to get your treats and go to James Madison park to enjoy them :) I didn't try any dishes, but I saw someone's pancakes which had more blueberries than batter.. yums! This place is cash only."}
{"text":"I'd heard they have one if the best breakfasts in Madison, and I have to agree. It's an adventure too. The space is tiny, the tables are cramped, and you get to share a table with strangers. That's part of what makes it great. I loved the atmosphere. The food was fresh, hot and delicious."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place. I'm always a happy camper after brunching here. Amazing omelets, and I love all of the cute furniture. This place definitely has character. Added bonus: most of their plates have fresh fruit!

I haven't had a chance to try their baked goods yet, but I'll definitely try one next time!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  Finest ingredients and everything is made from scratch and cooked to perfection.  There's no reason for me to describe the food because when I say perfect I mean it.  You need to try it if you are in Madison, but good luck since the restaurant has very limited seating.  Brunch food at it's very best."}
{"text":"Delicious, and lively.

The only way you can complain about this is you are a stickler about personal space. 

We had to share a table but the couple was very nice!

BEST WAFFLES!"}
{"text":"Breakfast at Sophie's comes at a price - to be able to be up and running early in the morning on the weekends cos that's the only time you will find them open. That said, the sauté pear with ginger and whipped cream waffles is an excellent thing to wake up to, if you not throw into a state of indecisiveness, greeted by the fresh aroma of pastry once the door is open."}
{"text":"We were here about 1:00 on Saturday. It was consistently busy, but not packed. We tried the croissant French toast, pancakes, black bean tacos and an eggplant/yellow pepper omelette. Coffee and hot chocolate too. All was very, very good. The flavors of the omelette were fantastic. It wasn't just chunks in the eggs, but flavorful throughout. The French toast was delicious with the raspberry sauce and the black bean tacos were perfect. On top of all of the great food, the staff was super friendly and took great care of us. We'll definitely be back on a future stop in Madison."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Probably a comfort food place reminding of your mom's omelet? Sadly, it didn't appeal to me. But I wouldn't say it's bad. Just an okay place. Truly believe this place is overrated."}
{"text":"I come from a very large family back in Michigan, where family get-togethers meant having a whole lot of people crammed into one tiny place. Always included: rubbing elbows, feeling cramped as you waited in a disorganized line, trying to keep up with a plethora of dirty dishes, and having that awkward table top conversation with a family member you wouldn't wave hi to if you saw them in the street. I miss the chaos, but I got a little fix of it here at Sophia's.

Sophia's is small, but homey. She's only open on the weekends, so you can imagine the high influx of patrons that flock to her craving Sunday brunch. The place gets packed. As you wait to claim a seat next to complete strangers, you nestle in what little space you have. We eventually sat, and our order was then set to prepare (made to order!). We talked and laughed with other diners next to us while we waited. I enjoyed the company.

I had the Croissant French Toast with raspberry spread. I am not too keen on sweets, but this is a definite exception. The toast was soft and doughy, and the raspberries sweet and sour. It brought me back to the days my grandfather would make it, with all my cousins and I waiting around the kitchen island, fighting over who got the first helping. 

In the end maybe I'm too sentimental, but I really liked my experience at Sophia's because it reminded me of home."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic neighborhood spot, and I'm glad to live near it.  Until this morning, every time I'd walked past Sophia's it had been closed.  A friend and I went to get some late breakfast (\"brunch\"), and it was definitely worth waiting in line.

I got cheese blintzes, which were nice because it isn't something I see on a lot of menus.  They were pretty great, and came with a little jelly on them (I'd guess apricot).  My friend got the \"special waffle,\" and I guess it was actually pretty special, since he finished it pretty quickly.

The most unusual thing about eating here was how you have to go back up to the counter to pay after you're done, which might be a good business strategy, since we both ended up buying baked goods to bring home."}
{"text":"First, the food was amazing. Breakfast was great.
However, after pre-paying (cash only) for our meals at the counter, we had the really weird experience of being asked for more money before leaving. 

Apparently there was an automatic gratuity added to for our party of six, which was a surprise to us. Even though the meal was self-service outside of dropping off food, I'm sure we would have left a few bucks for a tip. BUT - still poor form to ask like that; that's never happen to me before.

Again- great food, but bizarre."}
{"text":"The cutest brunch place in all the world.  I only wish it were open more than saturday and sunday

WHY SO MANY STARS:

1. The cafe is in the downstairs of a house and it feels like you are in your grandmother's kitchen.  You can see them make all the food.  The coffee is delicious and plentiful.  You grab a mug (all different varieties, non-matching, so charming) and fill your own.

2. The seating forces you to share tables with strangers giving it a communal atmosphere

3. THE COFFEE CAKE! I've never had such a simultaneously creamy, fruity, tangy, crumbly coffee cake.  INCREDIBLE.

4. The omelets are so delicate and rich.  Ever-changing ingredients--fresh mushrooms, fancy cheese, arugula, chorizo.  mesmerizing.

5. It's off the beaten path a  bit so you get a different crowd/feel than a lot of places in madison.

They are expensive but well worth it for a weekend splurge"}
{"text":"Sigh. I really, really want to call Sophia's a hidden gem...but that would just be a terrible, terrible lie. 

The restaurant has enough space for 10 people...if you're lucky. Get there early and be prepared for a looooooong wait. It's always crowded, but that's not the metric, is it? No--the metric is the food. This is the best brunch in Madison, bar none. Keep Marigold Kitchen, Mickey's, any place on the square--Sophia's blows them all away. From the black bean tacos, to the waffles with fresh peaches and homemade whipped cream, to the amazing, amazing omelets--you really can't beat Sophia's.

Get there early. Be prepared to wait. Then, have the best brunch in all of Madtown."}
{"text":"I live a few blocks from Sophia's and recently checked it out. While we tried to beat the crowd, we found ourself constantly squishing our chairs closer together or getting up to allow people through. Needless to say, it felt overly crowded and a bit claustrophobic. The food was good, but a bit over priced. I ordered the Ham and Cheese Croissant with fig spread. While I usually love fig spreads, I didn't think it went with the savory flavor of the ham and cheese. However, I did enjoy the side of a freshly sliced apple. While I enjoyed the food, the ambiance was to hectic and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Cute little place. I can tell the workers put their heart and soul into the cooking. The feta tomato and basil omelette was divine, the eggs so fluffy and delicious. We got pancakes to share for the table and they were at best, mediocre. IHOP has better ones. My partner had the sausage and pepper omelette and he was overly pleased. We both freakin loved the potatoes. Made to golden crisp perfection. 4 stars for the food. 

The atmosphere was not my favorite. Probably because I'm an east coaster. Everyone was on top of one another and it was very claustrophobic. It was \"cute\" that others got to sit with us at our table, but not my style. Small town feel for sure. But definitely not for me. 3 stars for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Those cottage cheese pancakes with raspberry sauce are no joke! Get them, you won't be disappointed. The only downfall this place has is it's size. It is incredibly tiny. You might have to share a table with a stranger or two, but that gives it charm. Also, don't forget to bring cash. No cards accepted."}
{"text":"This place was great. Hot, busy and crowded, but great! It's teeny tiny, but people are willing to share tables inside, and outside my sister and I set up on a little bench with no-kidding- little TV tables that worked pretty well!
Do-it yourself coffee, and fantastic breakfast. I had an omelet with grape tomatoes, mozzerella, and some other veggies. It tasted like everything was bought at the Farmer's Market the day before. My sister had the chocolate chip pancakes with orange sauce-a little too sweet for me-but still fabulous. The strawberry waffles I saw other people eating looked amazing-and very seasonal! Great breakfast before we headed back to the Twin Ciites."}
{"text":"Been going to Sophia's pretty regularly for 4-5 years now.  

The Atmosphere: Relatively European, very close set.  If you're claustrophobic don't bother.  I like the family style seating most of the time and have gotten to know some of \"the regulars\" over time, which makes it quite fun.  You feel much more like you're participating in the restaurant rather than simply spending money there.  The local home-style feel of the place is one of the main reasons I keep coming back.  If you're in a hurry or have a large group I would strongly recommend going elsewhere.  I usually don't walk in there with a group larger than four.  Also, try going at off peak times for breakfast and you won't have to wait (before 8:30-9:00 or after 11:30-12:00 is usually a good bet.)  I've seen so many negative reviews about the lines and waiting and not enough space.  To those people I challenge you to find any half way decent breakfast place within 5 miles of the Square area that doesn't have a huge crowd between 9:00 and 12:00 on a Saturday or Sunday morning.    

The food:  It's good, fresh, local food all at a pretty decent price.  It's very solid, but nothing I would rant about.  Go to any of the more commercial type breakfast places in the downtown area and you'll expect to pay a few dollars more for the same quality food.  There's pretty high variance in quality of the food that comes out of the kitchen compared to other places.  The coffee is above average, about what you'd expect from a reputable breakfast place.  They have fresh squeezed juices that are somewhat pricey , but delicious.  

Pastry: The pastry is what sets them apart from other places.  They really have some of the best pastry in Madison.  The apricot roll is my favorite."}
{"text":"Love this bakery! Everything I've ever ordered has been delicious. Also: they only accept cash!"}
{"text":"I feel like an update is necessary here.  

I have been to Sofia's many times now in the last couple of months, and I have to say it never disappoints.  The squash omelette is like the best thing EVER, and their cinnamon rolls are just perfect.  The black bean tacos and cherry crepes are pretty delish too.  

Some small criticisms are that the egg on the croissant sandwich is kind of too much, and the ginger pear waffles are pretty heavy on the ginger.

i finally got to sit with some of my \"fellow madisonians\" and we talked through breakfast, and it was super nice."}
{"text":"I checked out out Sophia's based on the rave reviews I read on Yelp and was not dissapointed! The food was fabulous and I personally enjoyed the atmosphere.
If you're not a people person you might not enjoy Sophia's as much though as a lot of people pack into their small dining area and most of the time you have to share a table with other patrons.
Also, keep in mind that they take cash only!

The food is great though and it's a perfect saturday morning breakfast stop!"}
{"text":"How DARE I not give this place all five stars, right?

Ok the food is great - I got it, tried it myself, and confirmed those findings.

But minus one star for a strange experience: The young niece or granddaughter (not sure) who would not let us sit down at the table we wanted to initially and then proceeded to question us about what we were ordering, why, where we're from - like she was interrogating us.  It was strange and unwelcoming. Perhaps I'm being insensitive here about a child with special needs or a personality disorder, but I'm not sure that's the case, and I'm posting it anyway. The ambiguity makes me feel like a horrible person! Crap."}
{"text":"I not only ate a chocolate croissant while sitting there but exported several to share with my sister-in-law and brother in Milwaukee and I froze one to eat on New Year's Day when I returned to NYC. What can I say? It pays to start the year out on the right foot! What wonderful food, comfortable vibe (though very small) and beautiful people. Sophia's!"}
{"text":"Everything Sean O wrote about tight quarters is correct. Expect to wait for a table with your food ready while people sit around lazily after finishing their meals as if they are lounging in their living rooms. 

And if you like to be bumped, grazed, and possibly spilled on by people maneuvering with hot full coffee this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Their potatoes are amazing.  Their croissants and baked goods are deliciously melt in your mouth buttery.  Their breakfast menu changes on a weekly basis and they're only open on the weekends.  The only thing I dislike about them is that when what dominates their breakfast menu are omelets, and I dislike omelets.  However, everything else is delicious that I always walk away enjoying my meal.  

The place is tiny, but I am usually able to find a seat by the time my food is ready."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, but I just kept on being disappointed by the experience.  When we walked in it was quite warm in the room, but cool outside.  There were no seat available, and when three chairs did open up, it was at a table that had to be shared with another group who was already there.  My son asked for hot apple cider, and they didn't bring it out for almost a half hour and it was cold, like refrigerator cold.  People kept on kicking my chair because there wasn't enough room for everyone in the restaurant, and there were about a half dozen flies zooming around trying to get a piece of everyone's breakfast.  For the price, I was left wanting a higher quality experience."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE the pastries. The cream cheese rolls are seriously to die for, and the croissants are great. Of course, that means the croissant breakfast sandwiches are amazing (they are huge - tons of eggs and cheese). We also had an amazing waffle that was fluffy and topped with lovely fresh whipped cream. My fiancee is picky about coffee, and likes theirs, which is saying something.

The only thing is the seating - it kind of stinks. I would love to take a group of people from out of town here, but am nervous about it since there isn't a lot to start with, and it seems to be pretty packed. But for just two of us, it's doable."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, and as it's in my neighborhood, it's become our routine to come here every weekend for brunch. And how I look forward to it!  

On the menu are always three omelette options (as an example, this past week featured butternut squash, grilled eggplant, and chorizo), breakfast burritos, and sweeter options including pancakes and waffles.   

The highlight for me are the amazing pastries sitting so temptingly in the glass case.  We usually take a slice of cake and a crossiant to savor later.  The cakes are my favorite, and they are so inventive! Apricot, almond and cinnamon cake...Pear and ricotta cake...I can't think of ever having better cakes before!

The place is super cute and homey and has great atmosphere.  However, the only two negatives are that it can feel very cramped, and they ask you to pay after you've ordered, which means you have to stand in line again to pay."}
{"text":"This place is such a unique treasure. I do not get to come here very often due to working on weekends most of the time. In fact I am owner of a competitor of this place, but I would eat here at least once a month otherwise. 

I have never had the same thing twice in all the times that I have been here. I always get the specials and maybe a pastry. Ingredients and flavor combinations are top notch. Doing the quality of work that they do in such a small kitchen is quite an accomplishment."}
{"text":"Crazy good food!!  Don't be turned off if there's a line.  It is totally worth the wait.  The staff is really friendly and efficient.  Food is generously portioned.  I ordered the croissant sandwich and it was ginormous.   And their pastries are delectable. Moist, tasty, and huge!! It's in a great location with outdoor seating.  Cash or check only, so come prepared."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, but there is almost no space. Some people left because there was no more space for them to sit. If you're lucky to grab a seat, it will be crammed but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"So amazing and delicious!  The seating area is small, but not a problem.  Didn't you learn to share in kindergarten?  Delicious brunch, and amazing pastries.  I had the waffles with whipped cream and strawberries, and a berry cheesecake crumbcake.  Amazing flavor.  Go go go!"}
{"text":"Not wild about the cramped quarters, but we got there at about 9:15 on a Sunday and while waiting for our food we were able to get a table that just accommodated our group of three people, so it wasn't too bad.

Also, the food was fantastic.  I tend to be tempted by sweet breakfast items but almost always end up finding them unsatisfying if I actually order them.  Not here!  I got the croissant french toast with cherries, and it did not suffer at all from the cloying sweetness that's often a problem with such breakfasts.  The cherries were pleasantly tart and the french toast's texture was absolutely lovely.  I also had a bite of my companion's spinach & feta omelette, and it was very good.

The bacon was great--thick-cut and cooked to satisfying crispness, but not overdone.  The only thing that didn't wow me was their breakfast potatoes, which I found rather bland.

Still, I look forward to going back and trying more menu items; it was very difficult for me to decide."}
{"text":"Wow, for the past couple weeks we visited just about all the top breakfast spots in Madison, and this place did not disappoint!

Being here on a Sunday morning at 10am, the place was full! It's not saying much considering the size of the place (same size as my bedroom) but that just adds to the atmosphere. It feels like you just had a sleepover at your neighbor's place and just woke up to a ton of delicious food.

I went with the croissant sandwich, which had all the regulars: cheese, nice slices of ham, warm, puffy croissant, but they threw something extra that made all the difference: *edit: figtapenade* some kind of jelly that added sweetness to everything else, and I have to say, the sandwich sure did the job. Plate also came with potatoes and a tiny portion of fruit, refreshing and leaves you wanting for more.

Only thing this place can do better is change the layout so that people don't have to step on each other to get seated, and all the tables/chairs feel pretty old...but I guess that's part of what they're going for.

Overall, Sophia's does not carry a large menu, but after my experience here I'm convinced to comeback and try another item, and...carry out of course!"}
{"text":"The French toast and Ham, cheese croissant were amazing.  We were just passing through town to Chicago and has been the highlight of our trip!  The coffee was EXCELLENT.  A must visit!"}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's a bit too cozy/crowded in the small dining room.  I had the cottage cheese pancakes with maple syrup - not the raspberry sauce.  Very good as was the coffee.  The hostess who takes your order was very friendly.  I will go back again."}
{"text":"Geez, I do not understand the hype. Came here for a late Sunday breakfast. Not only was there a wait for tables, there was also a wait for the food. And I don't mean just a wait, I mean a WAIT. It took over an hour between the time we ordered and the time our food came out. I'm not sure if they just forgot our order or if it really took that long, but it was ridiculous. No amount of friendliness can make up for that.

On top of that, the food was way overrated. I got the tacos and they were in one word: bland. The eggs were cooked well but were nothing spectacular. The tacos were simple tortillas with black beans, guacamole, sour cream, and a green salsa that was barely there. My SO got an omelette and I felt it was mediocre as well.

Don't expect me to return until the ownership turns over and things change quite a bit."}
{"text":"This place is a throw back to when your Grandmother cooked everything from scratch. Maybe even back to when Mother's and Grandmother's used to cook on a coal/wood burning stove. It is a small place and usually you might have to sit with other friendly people at different tables, but that makes it an unforgettable eating experience.  ALL HOMEMADE COOKING AND DESERTS! !

      You must stop by on Saturday's and Sundays only!"}
{"text":"The man who took my order was just lovely--very courteous and welcoming.  I wandered in at about 1:45pm, just because I was walking by and was hungry.  There were no hours posted outside (actually, anywhere that I could see), so I didn't realize that they close at 2pm.
I ordered french toast and a woman shouted from the back that they weren't making any french toast for the day (she sounded put out that I'd ordered anything in the first place).  I asked the man at the counter if it was too late, and apologized because I didn't realize they were closing (again, no hours posted).  He said it was totally fine and would I like something else?  So I ordered blueberry pancakes with real maple syrup.  When they came out (and it was quickly, so that was great), they were fantastic.  They tasted wonderful and they were light and fluffy.  I was out of there by 2:05pm.
Still, I felt like I was intruding on that woman's day, and she did nothing to make me feel otherwise (even when I was finished and tried to bus my own plate she acted like I shouldn't even be asking her where to put it).  I get that she was probably tired, and trying to clean up.  Still, that kind of put a damper on an otherwise awesome meal.
All in all, I would've given Sophia's 5 stars, because the food was awesome, and the man at the counter, so nice.  But that lady's attitude (and the fact that no hours are posted outside), were pretty irksome."}
{"text":"I love Sophia's but she's a bit of a handful.  So, here's the gameplan: in an out prior to 9:30 a.m. OR get the bakery to-go.  Then, if you live two blocks away (also part of the gameplan) you can get it all done on your dogwalk and (assuming you queued up ahead) the coffee'll be ready just in time when you get home."}
{"text":"Very small! Don't come with more than three people, but definitely make sure you get here. It is a lovely place with pretty good breakfast. The huevos rancheros are very good; I have a hard time ordering anything else. I just wish the coffee included free refills! I also thought that the croissants were a little dry, but I may have just gotten an off batch."}
{"text":"some sort of magic is going on back there. there's simply no way to recreate this stuff. 

and the baked goods! oh my god! 

plus, they make you feel like family."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast, but be prepared to wait for a seat and your food. I came here by myself on  Saturday, put in my order around 11:45am and didn't get my food until 12:45pm. I ordered the butternut squash omelette which was delicious! Never would have thought to put butternut squash in an omelette, but it works. The egg was buttery and fluffy and the squash, peppers, and cheddar cheese worked perfectly together. Aside from the wait, my only other complaint are the potatoes that came with the omelette lacked some seasoning. Don't forget to bring cash."}
{"text":"I loved their brunch menu and the store is so cute. I gave them four stars since you have to wait in line twice. Once to order and once to pay. Make sure you bring cash since it's cash or check only."}
{"text":"I like the bean tacos, coffee and baked goods. I do not like eating here. Gotta take it to go, or be forced to listen to everyone's conversations and smell their body smells."}
{"text":"The cheese blintzes are to die for.  I also got to try the Egg and cheese croissant, which was buttery and light. Yum!  Cash only and very crowded though so be forewarned."}
{"text":"Sophia's had it's ups and downs during my visit.  I'll start with what I liked about the restaurant.  I loved the atmosphere!  It's a small ma and pa type place with only about 5 tables.  They have an assortment of coffee mugs that were likely collected over the years.  The staff was very inviting and polite and made our experience a good one.  Of the three food items we got, the egg and cheese croissant sandwich, with bacon added of course, was absolutely out of this world!!  One of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had.  If what I wrote so far was the end of my meal, this would have easily been 5 stars.
However, at a breakfast place/bakery, I would expect them to do two things exceptionally well;  pancakes and cinnamon roles.  Unfortunately, the three people in our group that ordered pancakes (one chocolate chip and one banana) didn't even eat half their order because they were no good.  And the cinnamon role I had was very tough, hard and seemed like it was made two days prior.  Definitely not what you'd expect out of a local bakery.  It's because of the pancakes and cinnamon role that Sophia's is only getting a 3 star from me.
It's worth checking out, but make sure to order something other than pancakes or the cinnamon roles."}
{"text":"What a letdown! I had heard from two friends in the area that it wasn't as great as I was making it out to be when I pitched Sunday brunch to them, but they were right. It's a hole-in-the-wall weekend brunch place (closed on weekdays) with uncomfortably close quarters and not particularly fantastic food, though it's plated well. On the whole, it just doesn't make much sense.

Expect a wait on the weekends, especially around 11. We arrived well before but still had a good 15/20 minute wait. The door opens into a packed room the size of my living room with its only path of egress also packed with counter orders. The orders apparently take longer than the wait, so they're queued up while you most likely wait outside (since five people are already waiting in front of the water/coffee self-serve and any remaining floor space). There is a menagerie of tables and chairs, so there's truth in that Sophia's is likely best for those dining alone, as there are many single chairs left in the overcrowded tables. Those seated closest to the wall are physically unable to leave unless those at the tables closest to the counter get up. When such a high price is put on ambiance, I wouldn't agree that Sophia's is homey as much as a fire hazard. I don't understand why such a successful place hasn't expanded.

The omelettes are the way to go. Sophia's pancakes and waffle were bland and somewhat dry on their own. I felt that even IHOP did them better. I found the cottage cheese pancakes uninteresting. My friend was leaving basically the whole dish over and it wasn't tasty enough to pick at. The berry syrup that accompanied it was almost sour. I don't think the cottage cheese pancakes are more than a managed risk--you have to really like either cottage cheese or pancakes in order to enjoy it. I had the banana walnut waffle and immediately regretted not ordering the asparagus omelette. Even with the banana, the waffle wasn't very tasty. My friend's breakfast sandwich (egg on croissant with fruit) was beautiful and definitely the best dish of the table, even with the fruit out of season. The eggs were not bland, and were cooked thin and appeared more oily than buttery. The kicker, though, is the syrup. Consensus at the table was that the the table syrup was awful, though \"real maple syrup\" is on the menu for extra. This is inexcusable for a brunch place, perhaps a deal breaker. Breakfast food has its off days, which can be excused, but when the refuge of syrup is also inhospitable, might as well not bother. If I were to come back, I'd try the coffee cake and choco croissant. 

It just didn't seem to make a lot of sense--the insane popularity, the insufferable claustrophobia, the family-style tables with no one talking to each other, the inability to move once seated, the ordering way in advance and paying after the meal as an afterthought. There appears to be some tradition here, and it's likely the most sane way to manage the joint, but I can't help but feel that this was low on my list of better brunch experiences. Likely better off with Madison Sourdough or Eldorato. I expected much more from the top rated brunch place in Madison."}
{"text":"Such a nice place. I think good things come in small packages. This place is open for barely 12 hours and that too just on the weekends. But they have some great food. I sat on a table sharing it with two couples. Got into a conversation while sipping coffee. Very nice place if you are a foodie and not a snob about privacy in an eating place."}
{"text":"So much potential. They have the entire \"hole in the wall\" vibe going on, with skimpy hours, a short menu, and a \"dont give a shit\" decor. The food was good, but not mind-blown out-of-this-world best-of-madison good. We had the squash omelet, which was tasty, but honestly a little bland. And the croissant french toast? Maybe I missed something, but I'm not sure where the croissants were! Overall tasty, but if they want to do the \"breakfast nook\" thing, you guys gottta crank up the charm a bit!"}
{"text":"totally love that you feel like you're in a friend's living room (read: SMALL, cozy space). the open kitchen adds to the vibe. a gem."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the food was really good both times. The first time I ordered an omelet with potatoes and the second time the special waffle. The home made whipped cream on the waffle was definitely a treat! The only reason this isn't a 5 star is because the potatoes were a little to salty for my taste, however, I don't salt any of my food.  There is a real small town feel to the place as you sit with other patrons and chat while you wait for your food. Definitely will be back to try their \"signature\" dishes."}
{"text":"i haven't had their brunch, but the baked goods are to die for. i will definitely have to come back. 

i would give this place five stars if it weren't for the super tiny dining area and the rude clientele. (everyone repeat after me - \"excuse me!\")"}
{"text":"If I thought they would let me set up permanent residence here, I wouldn't think twice about dropping my mattress and rolling out my comforter. At Sophia's, they put the word \"cozy\" to shame. It's more how I imagine being in a cocoon would be like, except everything smells like fried potatoes, fresh coffee and love."}
{"text":"PROS: Solid brunch fare
CONS: Insane wait times, cash only, limited seating

The food here is pretty solid. Great eggs, potatoes, and tacos --- and lots of standard brunch dishes to choose from. Very reasonable prices too. However, the place is insanely small, and we arrived at a busy time, so the wait was atrocious! It took 2 hours to receive our dishes after setting foot into the restaurant... Is the food good? Pretty good. Good enough to warrant a 2 hr wait? Likely not. If you can catch a non-busy time to drop by and happen to be craving brunch food, it's worth a stop."}
{"text":"You know a place is good when it's at capacity and a there is a line. Although seeing as Sophia's only has 3 tables, it's not hard to reach capacity. There was a steady stream of customers the whole time my boyfriend and I were there. The menu is short and simple. There are omelets, pancakes, bean tacos, and you can order a la carte and get eggs, bacon, sausage, and they also have pastries. 

We ordered the sausage and red pepper omelet, as well as a savory mushroom pastry. The pastry was mind-blowingly delicious! The filling was a pate-like mushroom paste, which doesn't sound that great but tasted like heaven. The omelet took a while to make because there were so many orders, but when we dug into it we felt the wait was justified. The omelet was fluffy and cheesy and every bite was full of flavor. 

The lack of tables means you will probably have to share with strangers, but everyone was super friendly and somehow it all worked out. If you order something that isn't a pastry, you pay for it after you eat. I'd love to come back and try one of their croissants, or perhaps some pancakes."}
{"text":"I'm tempted to give this place one star and tell you it sucks just to keep all the amazingness that is Sophia's to myself. The only thing I am ever annoyed about is the service. I don't know why they don't give you the juice and pastry when you order it at the counter. Last time I was there the counter person/server forgot our pastry order until we already had our egg-dish. Kind of a lame complaint I know, but it's details like this that get me. I want my croissant while I wait for my omelet. I don't want to wait 5-minutes to get my OJ. You could have handed it to me when I order. I don't understand how Sophia's hasn't thought of this...but still 5-stars for the amazing food, organic eggs and coffee, and the pastries."}
{"text":"Probably one of the most delicious breakfast spots in Madison, hands down. The bakery is is also amazing!! Unfortunately they only take cash, so make sure to hit up the ATM before. Once you order one of the delicious omelettes or pastries you wont be disappointed!!
The sitting arrangement is shared community tables, which can make for some interesting eating partners but also good conversations."}
{"text":"Nice place, very friendly people, food seems to be very healthy and nothing \"industrial\". Very crowded as well and \"studenty\" feel.
My omelette, I asked without peppers and wasn't possible...hummm...not so much hand made. And no cards and no wifi. Nothing special. Food was good."}
{"text":"Yumm. Had the squash omelette. So good.  Very tiny place and they only take cash or checks. Service was fast and friendly. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Probably not for everybody... But if you enjoy tiny diner-type places with great breakfast food and friendly service, you'll love this place.  A friend and I stopped in the morning of the Farmers Market and a Badger game at Camp Randall, so we avoided the typical morning crowd that gathers outside waiting to get in you'll see on a typical day... If you can time it like we did, you may avoid a long wait for your delicious food and may even get to sit down (a luxury here!). Even if you get to sit down in the diner, plan on sharing your table with other patrons... if that bothers you, you may want to place your order to go.  

I ordered Croissant French Toast w/Raspberry sauce, which was amazing and my friend ordered a generously-sized omelette that cam with some home fries. She enjoyed hers as well.. And we both walked out feeling satisfyingly stuffed.  The coffee was from Collectivo.. Nothing too special.

Like I said,not for everybody.. But definitely worth it if you can time your visit right (or don't mind a long wait)."}
{"text":"I almost don't want to write a review for Sophia's because I'm afraid it will evolve past its awesome current neighborhood hole in the wall. But I can't help it - it's too good to be kept a secret. The pastries are amazing, the pies even better (if you call ahead, they'll set aside a few of their individual-sized pie/tarts for you). Strawberry-rhubarb are ridiculously good, as are peach-blackberry and probably just about everything else. Breakfast/brunch foods are also great, just the right mix between super-fresh ingredients and a little grease for your Sunday morning. The omelettes and savory crepes are especially great, although every once in awhile I'm partial to the Belgian waffle with fresh fruit.

Sophia's is only open Saturdays and Sundays since they spend the rest of their time supplying other Madison eateries with their goodies, so to get the real deal right out of their ovens, hit it on a weekend - the earlier the better since they do get busy!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. I definitely prefer to take the food to go, especially since I was staying just a quick walk away from this place. The place is small and usually packed, and the tables are more like small dining room tables than restaurant tables. If you like meeting new people, it can be a nice experience to sit down to eat with people you don't know. I liked the food, especially sweet dishes like blintzes."}
{"text":"Food is good, but the place is tiiiiiiiny.  That adds to its charm, however.  I just hope you don't end up having to share a table with an unwashed, wanna be madison rasta kid that wants to talk the entire meal.  Unless of course, you're a fellow unwashed madison wanna be rasta who wants to talk about bringing down the establishment.

It's really like you're sitting in someone's kitchen.  In fact, when you order, you look right into the kitchen before you have to pirouette on a dime to turn around and search for a seat.  There's about 8 seats in the place.  Truly enjoyed the meal, but I'm just not sure i'm patient enough to go here often given the wait and cramped space."}
{"text":"Best waffle. Ever. 
Almond crosant wasn't like a traditional crosant, bready- not as flakeh, but it was still delish."}
{"text":"Sausage omelette was excellent, will not order plain pancakes next time (not very fulfilling). MAKE SURE TO BRING CASH OR A CHECK (they don't take credit); I'd say at least $30 for two people to be safe. They do have real maple syrup here. Parking can be a bit difficult to find (coming from a West-sider) and this place seems very ideal for days with good weather. Try to NOT come during peak hours; they have very limited capacity."}
{"text":"Went here with my family for Sunday Brunch.  We were a group of 9 and filled up about half of the total seating area!  Bear in mind the place is small, but really, that's part of the charm.  The coffee, food, and ambiance were all excellent.  Everyone loved their food- most of us had a croissant sandwich, my mother had the special waffle topped with fruit.  Very fresh, delicious ingredients, preparred with love by people who know what they're doing."}
{"text":"Food is SUPER FANTASTIC.  It's cute and cozy.  Has a lot of charm and unique old atmosphere.  Downside - super tiny.  Although this can add to an interesting experience.  We shared a table with 4 other people.  I can't think of the last time I went to a restaurant and shared a table with complete strangers.  But we had an interesting chat.  My suggestion - Go early!"}
{"text":"Don't come here.  Really.  Please don't.

Because the food is delicious and the atmosphere is homey and cozy and warm and if you come one time, you're just going to want to come back again and again and then I will have to wait even longer to eat my delicious chocolate croissant or my squash omelet.  

Or at least have the decency to wait until I'm out of town."}
{"text":"OMG, the BEST place for breakfast in Madison. 

Omelet is perfect. Coffee is brewed perfect. And their pastries (croissant, blueberry coffeecake, scones etc) are so good. I kind of want to keep this place a secret to avoid the overcrowding that they're already experiencing, but oh well, I want everyone to know what good food (and atmosphere) really is all about!"}
{"text":"Okay, I'm probably going to get some flak for this one, but really..what's all the hype about? My gripe wasn't with the cash-only policy, the hours, or the need to share tables with complete strangers. Plain and simple, the food just didn't have that 'wow' factor I was expecting.

My friend and I split a half-n-half omelette: half caramelized onion/mushrooms & half sausage/poblano, and it was...fine.  I thought the home fries with sweet potatoes were a nice touch, but that was it. I've been told that Sophia's is known more for their sweet pastries than their savory dishes, but brunch food is brunch food, and I was not impressed.

All in all, it just wasn't a very comfortable dining experience. IMO, Sunday brunch is supposed to be a pleasant, gentle awakening from the weekend hiatus. Instead, I felt like my whole brunch experience was overshadowed by the extremely cramped, dirty, and stuffy dining area. 

No thank you, Sophia's. I'd rather be across the street at JPH."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting a friend. I counted on yelp to help me find a good breakfast place. This is the BEST bakery/cafe ever. The service was extremely nice and the food was terrific. The chocolate crossiants are the best things in the world! The portion are big. The atomsphere is cozy and like having breakfast with the family. 

Thank you for yelpers for showing me this great community gem. When I am in town from Michigan I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Get there early.  I mean, really early.  I mean, when they first open the doors kinda early. There aren't many tables and it's tiny inside.

The boards show what they have to offer everyday.  I hear it changes so they keep the menu fresh.  

Be polite, the peeps here are good ones.

If they happen to have the Asparagus, Smoked Salmon, Cream Cheese, Dill Omelet.  Get it.   (pic posted)

If there are 2 people in your party, have your other party order the Cherry Crepes (if they're up on the menu). (pic posted)

Yes, get coffee.

Go halfsies on your breakfast.

Put your plates and cups away when you're done.

Get a cinnamon roll to go, for later, when you will definitely want more deliciousness in your stomach.

Lather, Rinse. Repeat."}
{"text":"this is the most enchanting place in all of madison.

i solely wish i lived in madison for no other reason than i could come here every weekend for brunch."}
{"text":"This place is overrated.  I have been here several times, hoping to get the type of food everyone is raving about.  The omelets were okay, the pancakes were okay, the bean tacos were fine.  I really do like their morning bun topped with lemon curd though.  Maybe I am missing something.  Otherwise, I think the food at other breakfast places are comparable and you don't have to deal with the cramped eating space."}
{"text":"A very good friend of mine was hired a few years ago.  Mind you, this friend has always been a stellar worker -- one of the most dedicated and hardworking men I've ever met and goes above and beyond what's expected.  Did I mention he's legally blind?  Shouldn't matter since it has never gotten in his way of anything.  Sophia gave him one day and fired him.  For that reason alone, I would never step foot in this place."}
{"text":"Insider tip (just learned this one this week): You can ask them to do up a half and half omelet if the choices on the wall look too darn tempting. So there's typically three and if you can ditch one you're left with a delicious blend of the remaining two choices. Don't use my name though lol, a friend that frequents the pace told me this but it's worth asking about... right? 

Also worth noting, their pastry is off the hook good! Seriously, everything I've tried. The raspberry cornmeal muffin, the cinnamon roll, the ooey gooey orange roll... it all rocks. 

Don't plan to go in a big group unless you're ok splitting up. Some of my favorite encounters there have been posting up at a random table and making new friends. 

Now, how about opening up during the week guys!"}
{"text":"This is my single favourite Brunch place in Madison. Almost everything is local, organic, and home made. The menu is small, but every thing on it is incredibly delicious. Its small atmosphere makes it very intimate, don't be scare to cozy down and sit at a table with other people! The service is kind and courteous, and Sophia herself is a delight. The pastries are her specialty, and her croissants are world class. And that means a lot coming from a French guy."}
{"text":"Tiny as shit. Like, you're sitting on top of tables. Like 100 sq ft for dining. As in claustrophobia, well don't even think about it. 

Why is it getting all these 5 star reviews? Well, it is charming I have to admit. The diminutive size gives a folksy, hippie-hip, ambiance. Men with beards, you've got em. Thrift store sheik women, of course. And, as is almost always the case with such a clientele, everyone is overly nice. 

The food, can't speak to it as we couldn't fit inside to wait. I'd be fairly certain it would be good wholesome fare (how could it not be with such a small dining area?). But, then again, I'd bet my left nut that people would rate this highly even if the food was nothing special. People are rating this because it's everything an Applebee's isn't. 

In all, I came away disliking the place. I mean, it's one thing to be cute, tiny and all that, but for god-sakes this place is asinine. Stick to being a bakery. 

Oh, and how the eff can this place claim to be handicap accessible? Maybe they mean if you stay out on the sidewalk, they'll run you out your order."}
{"text":"I really don't get the hype. Came here for brunch a while ago after seeing all the rave reviews, and the bf and I were both disappointed. There are definitely better places to go to for brunch food in Madison, and the place is TINY! There are three tables, and you likely won't get a table to yourself unless you come in a 6 person group. You order food before seating yourself, so it's possible to get your food and not even have a place to sit. The seats themselves are small and uncomfortable, and I'm a pretty short person with short legs. I can only imagine how awful it would be to sit at those tables for someone taller.

Overrated for mediocre food and an uncomfortable overall experience. Also pretty expensive for a no frills brunch place with no table service. (~$8 for 2 pancakes with apples on them! no sides of eggs or potatoes or anything!)"}
{"text":"Transcendent.  Maybe the best breakfast in Madison.

CONS: absolutely packed all the time.  You'll share one of the three tables with two or three other parties on a first-come first-seated basis after you wait in line to place your order.

PROS: everything else.  Awesome coffee, friendly staff, and breakfast foods so good you won't believe it.  The croissant french toast is brilliant.  Last time I went I had a waffle with spiced pears -- indescribably tasty."}
{"text":"Well... I've finally had breakfast here. I'm usually not up early enough to make it. Actually, almost never. I work nights, see... and I am just naturally nocturnal. I woke up before noon for some reason, so I figured I'd try and make it over to Johnson Street. I had blintzes, a side of bacon, and coffee (which wasn't ready yet when we got there, no big deal). The food was really delicious. The service was friendly. The woman who heads up the order the counter is sweet and soft-spoken. I really liked sharing a table with other folks, as I am gregarious. My friend, not so much. I think he felt crowded. Also, there were tons of flies bothering us while we ate and landing on someone else's un-bussed dishes- I bussed 3 tables to try and lessen to problem, but without much luck. I could've cleared off almost every table in there, but then I would've started cleaning- the place is kind of covered in dust and grime and needs a good top-to-bottom scrubbing. After we ate, I got a croissant, made in-house by Sophia herself, to go. I made an amazing egg and cheese sandwich with it the next day. All in all, I would return, if I can get up that early on a weekend. It was worth it for the wonderful blintzes. I FRACKIN' LOVE BLINTZES."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely worth the cramped dining space, the lines, the (often) long wait, and odd hours. 

Why? The workers are super friendly, the coffee is hot, the pastries are delicious, the prices are fair, and every single time I have been here my food has been amazing."}
{"text":"Menus is pretty simple. I ordered the only omelette with meat on it and their plain pancakes. Food was great, Tasted fresh and filling, and Pancakes were good too, although I'm still a fan of IHOPs pancakes, it's no knock against theirs at all. I came in a Sunday 1pm-ish and happy not see it not be packed and food took about 15-20 for myself and my parents. 
Only thing keeping me from giving them 5 star was the service. I'm not a fan of having to get the employees attention as I'm looking for one of them to notice me standing asking for help or assistance. It was my first time here and had no idea you had to walk up to them and order before you sit down. No signs or guidance so I would think they would care to greet their customers first and let them know instead of me approaching them. No big deal and they were nice people but it's that little extra in the importance of greeting the customer. All in all, no reason to not eat their food and possibly come back for more."}
{"text":"this is the best breakfast place in Madison (and this town is full of awesome breakfast spots)....or anywhere I've been. they're only open on the weekends so you spend your weekdays longing for the amazing cottage cheese pancakes with fresh boysenberries on top, the omelet specials (usu. 3 different ones)...like caramelized onions, roasted grape tomato, fresh basil and mozzarella.....very very awesome.  their home fries are fresh, good , and not swimming in oil (much better than lazy janes  or even marigold in my opinion).  
the pastries are among the best i've had, close to the polish ones i get on the east coast...not overly sweet!! (most Americans do not get how to make pastries)...get the berry crumb cake which is unlike any crumb cake you've had, the bundt cakes are great too. 
the place is very cozy and very small, but i'll gladly stand on the sidewalk in the madison summer heat to eat sophia's cooking."}
{"text":"Love the food, but the dining experience can vary depending on the volume of customers.  Today, it was quite busy when we arrived but difficulty finding seating and waiting for food was compounded by the presence of 3 large groups and 1 smaller group that lingered over coffee for a long time.  Customers have the right to sit and chat after their meal, but when 1 table represents 15% of the seating area, it affects the rest of the the restaurant.  We waited for a long time, longer than I've ever waited, to both sit and receive our food, and so did most others.  I think that Sophia's should also require that you pay at the time you order. Right now, you can choose to pay either at the time you order or after your meal, but paying after your meal means that you have to go up to the crowded corner once instead of twice, again, decreasing customer flow.

By its nature, the tiny space can be a bit hectic but today it was excessive. 

As for the positive, the food was excellent and the cheesecake/coffee cake combo was delicious."}
{"text":"The cottage cheese pancakes are the must-try here! Together with the fresh raspberry sauce, it's a perfect combination to start an energetic day!
The place is packed with people on weekends. So make sure you come ahead of line.
Need to try those omelettes next time. They also look so good!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best brunch/breakfast that I have had in Madison. The baked goods are to die for, and the eggs are very simply cooked the way that eggs should be cooked.
Homemade blintzes.
Yes, the place, itself is way too small, and it WILL be difficult to find a place to sit. (You'll most likely wind up eating sitting on the curb outside.)
Still, do yourself a favor, if you are looking for breakfast on a weekend in Madison, get off the beaten path, a couple of miles from the Capital, and find this tiny little place.
It is wonderful."}
{"text":"Yummy, yum Sophia's. I wish you were open more often."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a Saturday morning breakfast, and arrived just in time to beat the rush! I had the breakfast croissant, which was basically an omelet on a croissant, and it was delicious. My partner had a scrumptious veggie omelet, and we split a cinnamon roll the side of our baby's head. All delicious! Very little seating, but we were able to share a table with another group, family style, and ate and people-watched in the cozy environment."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for breakfast, especially because it is so close to my house. You will have to wait in line and share a table after about 8:30, but the homeyness and yummy food/coffee make it an experience"}
{"text":"Scratch cooking, cramped quarters, flea market collection of coffee cups, no credit cards, shared tables, breeze flowing through the screen doors, friendly staff, excellent coffee...all this and more make Sophia's my favorite breakfast spot.  Not just Madison, but anywhere."}
{"text":"I like Sophia's. I like it a lot.

It's the type of place that you'll drive right past and have to circle back around because you missed it as it is pretty inconspicuously situated.

And though it is quite a tiny shop, the inside is lovely. The seating is very limited, but it always works out that you have a place to plop down.

The menu is posted on the wall as you walk in and you'll order at the counter then wait for enough seats to clear up. Once at your table, the kitchen will start cooking up your food. And it is very good food. But more on that later :)

There's an overall aura to Sophia's that is so charming. Maybe it's the fact that you sit down next to whoever happens to have room at their table or it could be the way that you can peer into the kitchen as if you're in someone's home. Anyways, it's just a lovely place that makes you feel happy.

Coffee is serve yourself at a cute little station with a collection of mismatched coffee cups. Again, rocking that charm.

Now it's the food that's the real star. 

-If you're feeling adventurous, the COTTAGE CHEESE PANCAKES are an absolute must-try. The cottage cheese results in an incredibly moist and tender cake that makes these pancakes nothing short of amazing. Seriously, once you've had a taste of cottage cheese pancakes there is no turning back. They are intensely crave-worthy. Next thing you know, you'll find yourself at an IHOP, crying at the inadequacy of what is now a clearly substandard pancake. Sophia's is the pinnacle of pancake goodness that, once experienced, will be impossible to erase from memory. Be warned.

-The breakfast potatoes of baby reds and some sweet potatoes were rustically chopped up, seasoned to perfection, and ever so scrumptious.

-All egg and omelets that I've tried here have been perfectly prepared. I love dabbling into their specials menu as they tend to come up with creative ingredient combinations for their omelets.

-The bacon at Sophia's is happy bacon. One order gets you a great portion and it is quality. These are some pretty big pieces of meat that have a nice peppery, maple taste to them with just the right amount of sweet. 

After every trip to Sophia's, I always leave thinking I can't wait until next time."}
{"text":"Great local breakfast spot.  Small outdoor seating area. Small but cute.  The croissants are great.  Had the egg cheese and bacon croissant with breakfast potatoes, served nice and hot and fresh.  A girlfriend had the cherry crepes which were delish.   We shared the Brie and fruit platter.  Large and shareable.   Coffee was good but you only get one refill.  A great find. Will return if in the Madison area in the future."}
{"text":"We'll def. be back for their chocolate croissant! Since the first time I had them two weeks ago, I've been haunted to have it again! What's holding me is only my prelims!!! Once I'm done with this deadly exam, I will give my self a treat and a delicious chocolate croissant will not be too  much to ask.
Hubby loved his omelet and I also loved my pecan belgian waffle. Glad we finally tried this place so we know where to go to find some weekend treat!"}
{"text":"Sophia's is like that girlfriend you broke up with last month.  You know the one that you can't stand but keep going back to because the sex is so great?  That's Sophia's: great food, questionable execution.  The bakery items are bar none and the ever-changing menu is filled with all sorts of organic breakfast goodness.  

However, the dining room is tiny.  No waiting area to speak of (unless you count the sidewalk) and only four tables.  You often will have to share your table with one of your fellow Madisionians.  This can either be an interesting way to start your Sunday morning or  really, really awkward.  Also, the hours are hinky.  Only open weekend mornings and even then, Sophia's closes randomly. 

Despite all of this, it's worth it.  Sophia's is a hidden Madison gem that shouldn't be overlooked."}
{"text":"hole in the wall hipster breakfast place. none of the plates or mugs matched, which gave a homey feeling to it. the menu was pretty small, so there weren't too many options, but the two omlettes we tried were delicious. the sausage in one of the omelettes were surprisingly real pieces of cut sausage links (yum) and not the kind of sausage you would get on a sausage pizza. the place was a little too small for my liking though. i would come back if they had enough tables to have your own table and not have to share tables and be uncomfortably close to the people next to you. so, 4 stars for just the food itself."}
{"text":"The best breakfast in Madison and fantastic baked goods. Very small and informal, not unusual to share a table with other patron; good way to make friends"}
{"text":"Best brunch in Madison by far...everything I've tried has been prepared to perfection. It's hard to pick favorites when there are so many great spots in Madison but this gem surpasses them all based on food alone. If you don't mind sharing your barely-any-elbow-room seat with wonderful strangers then you'll love the atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Food is good, but not good enough to overlook such a tiny space. It is cramped. The food is also a little too expensive for what you get. So, if you are willing to share a table and apologize for your elbows, then it might be worth it."}
{"text":"I accidentally drove by this cute little place yesterday then looked it up on Yelp and had breakfast there this morning.  I believe it is only open on weekends for brunch/lunch from 8am-2pm.  I LOVE Sophia's!  I had the cottage cheese pancakes with the fresh raspberry sauce which was smashed raspberries...so light, so fresh, so delicious!!! The 2 scrambled eggs I got along with the bacon & coffee also delish!  I will come back here every time I come to visit Madison."}
