{"text":"My kids and I came here on a whim (sudden Bulgogi craving) and we loved it. Great service and yummy food. Even my picky eater 9 year old was obsessed with his Yakisoba. I had the bibimbap which was delicious."}
{"text":"This is the place if u like to pic out!!!!  I'm Korean my self it's very hard to find good Korean Restrunt in Arizona!  I will recommend this place to anyone like to enjoy food. I will recommend all my friend. \"GOGI\" means in Korean is Good Meat."}
{"text":"I was craving Korean food after a recent trip to Korea and thank goodness I found this place! I got the spicy beef  and it was on point! Tasted just like back in Korea! I was pleased to see a decent portion of kimchi and other veggie sides as a part of my dish. I got my order to go, but I noted as I waited for my food that the ambiance was very calm and enjoyable! I'm definitely coming back for dine in!"}
{"text":"My mother is Korean, I lived in Korea as a kid, and there wasn't a meal in my house that didn't include rice and kimchi. I feel this makes me a good judge of Korean food. Gogi is delish! The restaurant itself is clean and nice, as well. Their Soondubu is spot on, the Bulgogi is typical, the daejigohi is delicious. Their food is similar to my mom's so I love it!"}
{"text":"Great Korean food!  Had their seafood pancake, bulgogi, kalbi, hot squid and bibimbap.   The food is fresh and service friendly.   Not a lot of Korean food options around Phoenix, this is definitely a good one."}
{"text":"5 star food 1 star service.  The staff is not rude or anything but just inexperienced.  They walk around aimlessly with no organization.  Had to ask for something 4 different times before we got it.  So we've been getting everything to-go.  Food is really good and I hope they can get their service issues resolved."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a really long time and I can say its Meh.  I was so excited but sadly disappointed.  First of all they don't have fountain drinks so  our drinks were from a can or plastic bottle. We  got the spicy pork (lunch) for $9.99, it was bland, lettuce wrap $5.99 but didn't get the chilli peppers, and 2 spicy tuna rolls. At first our waitress only put in for 1 order so we had to wait. The rolls were big and fat for $4.50 and worth the price. I love it when the tuna is still cold and the rice is slightly warm. That's the only thing that save Gogi from 1 star.  The spicy tuna was the BEST thing here.  I would ONLY come back for that."}
{"text":"good foods but the service is very slow.  They basically forget to take your order unless you call for their attention or else you'll never get your order."}
{"text":"Meh. Nothing is wrong but nothing is special. OK for a group lunch but not a dinner place for me."}
{"text":"Second time was the charm !  First visit during grand opening week was horrible. Bad service and food was not the best. BUT I came back after hearing the good reviews to verify for myself.  Gotta try the Hot Stone Bowls (beef, chicken, pork, or tofu).  Presentation was awesome. Your meat of choice is served on a bed of rice along side various  saut√©ed vegetables and topped with an over easy style egg. It comes out sizzling hot and you can hear the sound it makes like when you order a fajita dish at a Mexican restaurant. Huge portion so I had it for lunch and leftovers for dinner :)"}
{"text":"The BEST korean restaurant in the valley & vegetarian friendly !!!   LOVE their GIGANTIC tofu stone rice (fried tofu, an egg, with lots of veggues and rice...YUM ! ) , soon tofu & mushroom soup, spicy noodle dish (buckwheat noodles and a green salad all mixed in a HUGE bowl ), spicy potato noodle ( clear but chewey , I think yam noodles with their green salad is my favorite noodle dish ) ! They also have veggie noodle soups.  Kimchee and their pickled radishes is very delicious (very generous) !!!!  Clean restaurant (dont mind the table in the womens bathroom though ) and friendly staff ....those poor guys work their butts off !!!  Lots of food choices on their menu. Huge portions !!!  My go to for korean in this area !!!"}
{"text":"GOGI is by far the best Korean restaurant that I have been to in Arizona. I am a regular here and just can't get enough of the delicousness this place has to offer.   Their bibimbap is better than any other place that I have been to and the pork belly is perfection every single time.  Just when I thought my meal couldn't get any better I heard our server say these magic words \"Here is our steamed egg on the house\".  I haven't found a Korean place that serves this amazing side dish and I almost couldn't believe my ears. I enjoyed every single bite of that fluffy flavorful egg.  I highly recommend GOGI to anyone!  Give them a chance to convince you that their Korean food is the best!"}
{"text":"Great Korean restaurant .. My first time we got seated very quick.. Good services and great food.. High quality sashimis .. Can't go wrong with sashimi tartar"}
{"text":"Service was bad and food mediocre; wife and I had our meal ten minutes before our sons"}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend! She said the stone rice bowl is a must try. Three of us came on a Tuesday. Ten minutes before they opened. The staff were very friendly and patient (Korean). They let us wait inside. It was a great meal! We ordered: beef hot stone bowl, beef rib soup, tofu soup, pancake, galbi. Stone rice is good enough for four girls. Rib soup is very light, but tasty for my taste. My boyfriend says he can't taste any flavor. The pancake is the best. It's big! With a lot of stuff inside. Crispy too. Great place~ Coming by at lunch time is a good option."}
{"text":"WOW!! their food was so delightful. i got spicy pork belly for lunch. good portions with good price and it had such a great flavo . service was good. the server was very nice and greet you with nice smile. side dish was great. they tasted like homemade. i got surprised with steamed egg which I didn't expect it to come and it was delicious!! I eat a lot of korean food and this place now become my favorite!!! keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Loved GOGI. They should open a branch in Phoenix/Scottsdale area. Chandler is too far away for the Phoenicians. Went with my fiends and husband. We ordered the chicken bibimbap, pork belly, chicken yakisoba and chicken teriyaki. Other than the teriyaki, the rest were scrumptious. I will surely go there if I am Chandler again."}
{"text":"One of the best Koren joints I've been to in a long time.  It's sitting in the same Plaza as Leelee market.  Super good food amd service!"}
{"text":"The first few times I tried this restaurant..I thought it was decent. This time..I really feel like the restaurant has gone south. For authentic Korean food..I feel like chodang and hodori is better, more cleaner. Chodang has the best tofu soup. Hodori, the best meat. Chodang is the \"cleanest\". Here at gogi, the tofu soup is mediocre at best. The kimchi is sickly sweet. The fried rice is the greasiest I've ever tasted. The tempura came out overfried. The bulgogi was fine. The dolsotbibimbop is oily as well. The seafood pancake is a good deal for $10. The raw fish and rice is ok..mostly salmon and too much salad. Overall, if you are non Korean..you may be satisfied with this food. But definitely ..I would not take any Koreans here to eat. The food quality is terrible. The service however is very good (thus the third star)."}
{"text":"The food here was horrible. We went only once but will not be going back, perhaps we went on the wrong day and the regular cooks weren't in, cuz it seemed like whoever made our food had no idea how to cook! Soft tofu soup tasted like a weak broth soup and pork bbq was burnt and dry. Giving 2 stars for our polite waiter."}
{"text":"Love the food- do not care for the servers. You have a 80% chance of getting bad service. One maybe two decent servers. The others need to sit and experience the terrible non attentive service they dish out. Why are tables around us who came in AFTER we ordered and get their side dishes and food before us? Why is my server jn the back doing nothing? Umm I can see you. Meanwhile everyone else is eating. Food quality 100% service 20%"}
{"text":"GOGI is a welcome addition to the (few) Korean food options in the Phoenix area.  The soon tofu soup is pretty good.  Would be nice if you were able to increase or decrease the spice level for varying tastes. I felt like something small was missing, though I can't quite put my finger on it (maybe more anchovy)?  Still tasty, however.  We also had the bulgogi and pork bulgogi, both of which were excellent.  Like other Yelpers have mentioned, the banchan (sides) were also great!  The service here is wonderful.  Very attentive and quick to refill your drinks and side dishes.  Price is reasonable.  As expected, the lunch prices are slightly lower than dinner.  Would go back!"}
{"text":"I lived in Korea for two years. The food and atmosphere resembles that of what I experienced in Seoul. The chefs and servers are all so friendly, and whenever I go in we chat for a bit and talk about Korea. Come here for an authentic Korean restaurant experience!"}
{"text":"The food here is very good but what really stands out to me and my family is the excellent service. The servers are always very helpful and kind.  The food portions are huge, which is always so nice. There are a lot of options and the food is truly authentic Korean food. Love this place and would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Good food its my first time going there with the family. So I would go back again and try something different. One thing I didn't like is that tney didn't have lettuce for lunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. I got the seafood soon tofu combo with bulgogi. Everything was so delicious. The side dishes were great too! Makes for a very filling and satisfying meal, and the flavor was authentic. Definitely will frequently visit for lunch, the prices are great for the amount of food you get. Great service, great interior and atmosphere, great food. Can't ask for anything more."}
{"text":"Come here in regularly and have yet to be disappointed. Yesterday, took a group of my friends here and ordered raw fish combo. Side dishes are great but main menu, the slices of raw fish, was just ok. Service was fast and staff are friendly. Clean and nice atmosphere. Love Soju-bombs as always!"}
{"text":"I didn't really like the seafood tofu soup that I ordered. It was over priced and didn't taste any good. Maybe the next time I go it will be better."}
{"text":"Love this place...They have the best kimchi of all the Korean restaurants in the valley...in my opinion. I really enjoy their spicy chicken bulgogi. I hope they can keep the doors open for a long time."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. The food is excellent but tonight service was awful- I ordered a big soup asked to pack for me then server brought two bowls for me to put the soup. Of course I made mess. While I am dealing w purring a big soup into two bowls, server wanted to clean the table. Very rude. Birthday I wanted to try gogi for dinners. Service sucks. We want to sit at he booth she was so rude saying we have reservation- rudely saying no one is sitting there. I will never go there. Food is excellent but service really sucks. Even rude- she could have told me nicely instead of keeping up her arrogant attitude."}
{"text":"Worst place for korean food. I've tired many restaurants and some may not be that good but at least they are not bad. But this is seriously the worse i've had. The spicy soup I ordered had no taste and barely any soup on there. And the whole bottom of the soup are all burnt. So I was eating burnt tofu and fish roe and the whole soup smelled burnt and tasted burnt. The raw spicy crab was okay i guess since idk how its suppose to taste like, but my boyfriend (a korean) said its rlly rlly plain except for being spicy). He ordered a cold noodle and it wasn't okay either. He also ordered surf clam sushi but the clam was not cleaned well, there's black stuff on top of it (it's part of the clam's stomach, but it should be clean for sushi)."}
{"text":"Took my Korean wife and mother in law there last night.  We enjoyed generous portions of delicious sushi, salad and soups .  Soft shell crabs and kimchi pancake were very fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Been there lots of times since they had opened. Their food and service were good at that time, but last three time visit was horrible. Food tasting was pretty good and lunch special is also good, but the service was very uncomfortable.   The server always looked angry, always didnt bring some stuffs and even showed attitude to us.   There was hair in a soup, so we complained. We didnt eat at all, but they just charged all food cost with 10% comp. We didnt say anything since we thought we are regular customers. Anyway I wont go back, Ban chan 1mile up there food taste and service is much better"}
{"text":"This is an updated review.  My husband urged me to try them again.  I have to say, I went back 4 more times during the evening before updating my review.  I am happy to report there is more servers and the owner actually comes to the floor to greet the customers.  The food is really good, I always get a second serving of their kim chi to put in my spicy noodles or my bibimbap.  Their Korean Chirashi is my other favorite item on their menu.  I'm glad they read my previous review and improved their service."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place for Korean food! Service was fantastic and courteous...even to the Caucasian guests at our table...which is not always a given at Korean restaurants :-). Kalbi was prepared and cooked just the way I like it...slightly sweet and cooked with a little bit of crisp on the edges. Yookajang was hearty with lots of shredded beef and vegetables. Panchan were all well-prepared and adequately fermented especially the kimchee.  We will definitely come back! Gogi, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"It was our first time and I'm relatively new to Korean food. I wouldn't hesitate to go back the food was stellar!!! Service is quick (almost too much so) and efficient if not overly friendly.  Don't hesitate to ask questions as the staff is helpful to newcomers but most of the people there seemed to be very regular patrons. It's that good. We had hot stone bibimbap bulgogi(beef) and pork and cabbage dumplings. Dumplings were as would be expected not dense with meat but lighter due to cabbage mixture. The hot stone bibimbap was out of this world hot(temperature not spice). I love my hot food hot and the stone kept it that way until we packed the leftovers! We even shared and still had leftovers so it's plenty of food. The rice base continues to cook and gets deliciously crunchy the longer it sits. Ingredients seem high quality and fresh."}
{"text":"Great ambiance! The food is fresh and tasty. The menu has a lot of great verity, and a really friendly staff. I will be back. Thanks gogi"}
{"text":"If you want a real taste of Korea then this is the place. I have a preference for the bulgogi but other things I've had like pancakes and kimchi are spot on."}
{"text":"Best Korean restaurant in az and it was ok. I wish they had the grilling tables. Service is good and they are very polite. Although the side dishes are not what I call great. I've had better in Denver. The soon tofu soup is really good. If they can make better side dishes they would get 5 stars"}
{"text":"We always try to find new places to eat and we weren't disappointed!  Their side dishes were extremely good (especially their kimchi) and we enjoyed our main dishes as well!  Will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Avoid this place. Food is not even good and the service is outrageously insulting. Spend your valuable time and money elsewhere like  Hodori in Mesa or Cho Dang at Chandler. I would have given zero star if there was an option.   I've been to Gogi probably 5 times total. Only reason is because of close proximity from my workplace.   5 out of 5 times, I've experienced very bad service by their incompetent waiters/waitresses.   They hardly understand English, not attentive, have to reminded many many times, entr√©e/rice/banchan/water does not come out in proper order or seriously late.  I can't understand how the owners cannot see this terrible food services their employees provide.   In all my visits, there were issues with extreme wait time for your food (even when they are not busy!!). Average wait time is well over 30 minutes or more.   Last straw that broke the camel's back was last Friday when I took my coworker for lunch. I ordered two kalbi-tang (beef rib soup) and side order of gyoza. The older waitress who took our order did not speak or understood English well. She didn't repeat the order she took. Just took down our order in hurry and was running like a chicken without a head.   We wait 40 minutes (thought I time them since this wait time is common here). I ask for our order to few of other waitresses. Our waitress doesn't even bother to check ( still running around elsewhere like she is super busy when they don't even have much customers). Finally one soup comes out and not even a apology. We still wait for my soup, nothing. It's now 50 minutes past. Still nothing. We get our side dish gyoza. I ask again to another waitress about my soup, I guess she checks my order and talks to our waitress. I overhear \"they got all their order, I don't know what he is talking about\". Our waitress then comes over to our table and speaks in angry broken English, \"you order gyoza and you got it\". I tell her, \"no, I've ordered two soups and a side order of gyoza\". She then smirks and taps my shoulder and says \"oh so sorry, hahaha\". I tell her I am very upset and nothing to laugh about because this isn't the first time I had services issues with them. She say \"you want a soup?\"  I say \" I only have 10 minute left for my lunch time, how can you now bring it?\". She just walks off.   I am furious now but didn't want to ruin the lunch for my coworker. I chomped rest of my small gyoza meal and I ask for the check. Another waitress brings out bill and our waitress brings out the soup. I am like \"what the F!!!\" She gets angry after I tell her \"why did you bring the soup now. I can't eat it in 5 mins\". She just takes it back without any apology again.   I write my complaint note in my CC receipt and leave. I will never ever go to this establishment again. The owners are clueless in how to run a business properly in service terms.   Heed my warning. If you don't mind waiting 40 mins plus in average for your average Korean food and crappy service, then you are an exception from the norm."}
{"text":"This place should of been one of those mmm mm places but its a front for a restaurant, for restaurant prices. I use to be the warehouse manager for Hite USA (korean liqour and beer) and use to deliver to every korean restaurant in the southern california region. This GoGi place is no way authentic to any korean spot that i have tasted, not even the shitty ones in california. I still can't believe i paid 30 bucks for 2 things. One from a lunch menu which is 9.99 and the other 13.99. 1 soda, 1 water.  No way im returning back."}
{"text":"Best Korean food I've ever had in Arizona, especially the Galbi ribs! Great, friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Had the noodle soup with chicken didn't taste good at all plus the chicken was not cooked properly the meat was red!!!!! My son had the chicken teriyaki chicken the chicken was dry overcooked had no taste we had to ask for more sauce which took over 10 mins to get!!!! The ribeye tasted horrible!! Ordered California rolls also worst I had! We told the waitress showed her the chicken in the soup and told her about the chicken teriyaki all she could say was sorry!"}
{"text":"Gogi is our favorite Korean restaurant in the valley. We love soon tofu soup with Calbi or Bulgogi. If you like sashimi, try Korean style sashimi salad. (it may not be in the menu but you can order it.)  The owners are very nice. I have been going to their restaurants for over 7 years, since they had a Japanese restaurant.   I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Delicious, Traditional, Family-sized Portions & Food Made out of Love  The best Korean food I (a Korean and a fatty) have ever had in my life. This is a luxuriously perfect and exclusive prime example of the best that Korean food can offer. Everything I would hope for in taste, portion size, deliciousness and scrumptious ness were all very welly satisfied by this restaurant.   Waiter was good, was friendly once he noticed that we were not going to be tough on him.  ~ Don't expect anything you are not willing to give. Stop the cycle of hate by loving those who hate.  It is pricey ($50 for our family,), but if you feel like treating yourself or your family and want the most for your money. This will satisfy your stomach and fulfil your taste buds deepest desires.  We just moved from Los Angeles where we would eat at many restaurants all throughout the KoreaTown area.  Yet I could not recommend a better, perfect example of Korean food here in Arizona or in California.  Spend your money with those who deserve it. Help those who love others, your dollar will go further.   God bless you all,  Jo Family"}
{"text":"I would say this place is in the top 5 for best Korean food in AZ. It's not overly special, but it is very decent.  The stews/soups are very flavorful."}
{"text":"This place was delicious on their lunch bulgogi. It was a big size for lunch. I couldn't finish it. I took home left over for my fianc√© and he wanted more.   Tip: don't come during lunch time on your lunch hour. We had to rush our lunch because it took forever."}
{"text":"Great place for Korean food! The hot stone bibimbap and fried chicken is a must!! The sweet and spicy chicken is mine and my friend's favorite, but we've also tried the garlic chicken which was a teeny bit sweet with chopped garlic on top which is also super good. The portion size is huge for the chicken!! And even if you get the  half-half chicken it is so worth the extra $2.99 because they don't cut out of the original portion size. All of the hot stone bibimbap options are great and you cant really go wrong there. We've also had the  soft tofu soup which was incredible flavor wise and kept warm throughout the meal. Every time we've been here the service has been the same waitress who is consistently friendly and always watches out for water that needs to be filled or if you need more sides. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My mom is a very..VERY picky eater like most Asian moms. She actually enjoyed eating here. We couldn't decide which entrees we wanted so I ordered 4 entrees for the 2 of us. Bring your appetite because there was no way we could have finished it all. Everything was very flavorful..will be back again & again!"}
{"text":"This place is unassuming upon entry. The staff is friendly and most importantly, the Korean food is delish! I came with my mother, aunt and uncle - all were born and raised in Korea. We ordered-the seafood pancake-not doughy, plenty of seafood and filling-so good. We also ordered OX knee soup and spicy pork neck potato soup. The names of both of these dishes grossed me out, but I had faith in my mother for ordering.    When the food arrived, it looked good. The taste was even better. This place is the real deal!!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was my second time here and it was even better than the first! I got the taretare hot stone and it was so good! It was even better than the bulgolgi that I had the first time. I was torn between getting the taretare and the fresh sea eel, but my boyfriend got the eel so I decided to just steal some of his. The eel was so warm and melty - definitely getting that next time! Service is very good, we were seated fairly quickly despite how busy they were. They were very attentive and made sure our food was perfect. Sides were very good as well. Definitely coming back, their hot stone bowls are just too good!"}
{"text":"I live in N. Phoenix, and this place is a 45 min drive away from my house. The food is worth the drive, gas, distance, and time. I dream about eating this food daily. Last night, the place was packed with Korean families who could be making their own Korean food at home, but obviously weren't bc this place is out of this world.  The service is sketchy, but the food is the highlight. Don't let the bad service keep you away from the delightfulness your taste buds deserve. The flavor here is full bodied and inviting. I never say this, but it's better than the Korean food I had growing up in a Korean American household. THERE, I SAID IT. *drops mic, walks away*. (My mother was an amazing cook, too)  We usually order the pork hot stone bowl (bibimbap); it comes out piping hot and stays that way. If you order a hot stone bowl, be willing to share or don't eat for several days before; it's a huge serving. One serving could easily feed 3 people. I wish I knew the right words to describe how tasty it is.  The haemul pajun was hot, crispy, and not so thick. It was the most homestyle pajun I've eaten at a Korean restaurant. Like the hot stone bowl, this is also a generous portion I'd order this as a meal and eat it all by myself. Ok, I'm a liar. If it didn't make me look like a pig, I'd order 2... All to myself.   We also had the Korean chirak. If you like sashimi, you'll love this dish. It's like bibimbap, but the fish is raw and it's served  in sliced red cabbage-like a salad. You get rice, on the side, to add in if you want. The sashimi was creamy, like butter, and incredibly fresh. You also got a lot of it. The cabbage paired perfectly with the sashimi. The sauce was a nice balance of spiciness with a hint of sweetness."}
{"text":"Great service. We are attended immediately. Food served promptly even thou it's quite packed. Yummy food too."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  My family went for dinner and sat there for 20 minutes and no one bothered to take our order. They should just put \"Korean only\" and not let anyone else in."}
{"text":"Good but not GREAT. Have been here a few times, twice for lunch and once for dinner. The first time I went, a co-worker and I went for lunch before our shift and ordered some specialty rolls (don't remember the names but one was on a bed of flames) and some other meat and rice dish. Service was friendly and for the most part, attentive. Specialty roll was just alright... found it to be mostly mayonnaise and crab meat. Second time I went I went for dinner with 2 girlfriends and we had drinks, assortment of sashimi, and some pork belly. The server was AMAZING, very very kind and polite, even asked his name (which I unfortunately forgot) and conversed with him. However, this most recent visit, is the reason for this review. Came in with another co-worker before shift once again and were sat in the very corner of the restaurant. We weren't greeted for at least 10 minutes which wouldn't have been as big an issue were it not for us to take notice to our server standing around chatting and laughing with friends. As soon as he approached us his first statement was, \"are you ready to order?\" said impatiently. We said not quite and (still without any drinks) and he said, \"i'll come back,\" still without grabbing a drink order, or introducing himself. We had to ASK him for the sushi menu AND he had turned around so quickly to walk away i had to ask him if we could have waters before he was too far away. He came back one more time and we were ready to order, we ordered our meal without difficulty or confusion and once i finished talking and handed him the menu he snatched it from my hands and stared at me with a demeaning look. So obvious that even my friend asked if i knew him or if i noticed his mannerisms. Never refilled drinks, had to get up to the booth him and his fellow employee were sitting at, texting, and eating, to ask for a to-go box seeing as my friend and i were in a rush. He acted as if us interrupting his mid-day snack was so inconvenient for him. Sorry, let me come back when you are done eating okay? Anyways, i've had good and bad service from many places but this one was service bad enough to make me write this post at all."}
{"text":"Ahhhh where to start? I love Korean food and this just hits the nail on the head. FYI-This restaurant prepares the meat for you, so no grill on the table top. However don't let that stop you from visiting (I always like grilling my own meat.), but still a wonderful meal with all the fixings. Most specialty meat dishes like Bulgogi ($17.99) are over $15, and they are enough for 2 people."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time the other day with friends. We were starving and the food came out extremely quickly! We ordered the kimchijeon, bulgogi, spicy pork bulgogi, spicy squid bibimbap, and pork belly. The portions were huge and delicious! The workers were extremely friendly and even checked up on us numerous times. The food was pretty pricey but would strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Not bad.  I was surprised at how many Japanese dishes they have included on the menu.  My brother's bulgogi was much tastier than my beef short rib ramen soup.  Said soup was quite garlicky in a light clear chicken broth, with too few noodles to be called ramen.  It came with rice, which I dumped in along with a few scoops of the fluffy sizzling egg souffl√©. The beef was cooked well, tender and not dry.  Service was very friendly, though my water did go unfilled for a bit.  The portions were huge!  It's an excellent choice for a neighborhood Korean place.  I would go back."}
{"text":"Good thing first, food portion is quite generous and it comes out quite fast. But, the experience was absolutely terrible. Maybe they need more servers, but we had to work super hard all throughout to finally get their attention. Even when we finally got their attention, they always miss to bring or remember what we've asked. We literally had to ask more than three times each time. We had no side dishes served, we asked a few times to set the table (utensils, cups), they served only partial of our food. They kept forgetting to serve us something until we finally got their attention. Anyways, it was an exhaustive experience."}
{"text":"Great food. The short ribs were delicious as well as the spicy tofu soup. I would recommend this place for lunch."}
{"text":"Their food size is pretty good one . But honestly the dumplings we got were way worse than my home made ones ... Too plain to have it . My order was pork stone rice which was super plain ...totally killed our appetite that night . Hope they can boost their food flavor up."}
{"text":"Tried this place one last time, this time for dinner (every previous experience had been during the day). The service was way better! Smiling waitresses, attentive but not hovering. So I guess my recommendation is to come at night for better service?? (Also try their bulgogi, it's a huge portion and amazing.)"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out for the longest and omg it was amazing. I love Korean food and bibimbap but this place made it exactly how I remember it and was delicious. The service was good and they were really fast with getting the food out. Definitely bringing my friends in with me next time!!"}
{"text":"The hot stone rice dishes are probably the best around town!"}
{"text":"Awful. Waited ten minutes for waters then waited another 15 minutes for just two rolls. The food did not taste fresh at all and even the fish in the sushi bar window looked terrible. The waiters would stand right in between my boyfriend and I and shout over our heads to the sushi chef behind the bar. Was totally awkward and rude and just plain weird. The miso soup was hot and didn't taste bad though kind of bland. Overall Bad experience. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Still my go-to place for stone bowl bibimbap!   This place has changed a lot over the years and one of those things is the service. I think they finally got it down and the service is so much better.  Prices are still very affordable and the food is still extremely delicious. My only complaint is the soups sometimes it can be bland but most of the time it's amazing. Love that they have the soon tofu combo so you don't break the bank getting multiple items.   Our order always consist of the seafood pancake and we always ask it for extra crispy and lemme tell you, that's a game changer.   Other favorite items is of course the galbi, spicy pork bulgogi, and spicy chicken!   There's always plenty of side dishes and they come with unlimited refills.   I would always recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"I had a craving for kalbi tang and found Gogi. Excited, I drove over, delighted to see that it was a new restaurant. I came in around 3PM so it wasn't particularly busy. The restaurant design was tasteful and clean, just the way I like it.   Since there weren't many customers at the time, I was waited on by two people. I had a variety of ban chan and my kalbi tang. Sometimes the service would overlap which could be a good and bad thing. I personally like eating without feeling that someone is watching my every move while devouring into my meal.   So I've had kalbi tang in NY and LA and typically the beef would be stewed to the point that it would fall off the bone. Or there would be bones, but they would be chopped into pieces so it would be easy to eat. In this case, it was two large meat bones. I was terrified to try to eat this without looking like a cave person. Worse, I had come from a work meeting and was wearing a really nice dress today. I tried using my chopsticks to pick the meat off without much success. I had no choice. I picked up the bone and ate the meat off with my hands, it was very messy and stew splashed on me. So embarrassing. Of course I knew they were watching my every move and within minutes a server came by and placed some scissors on my table. I proceeded to spend the next 10 minutes hacking up my beef with my hands and the scissors. Again, very and messy.  I didn't take a picture, but noticed that there is one of the kalbi tang in the photos in the yelp page.  The quality of the stew was good, but the preparation of the kalbi tang was not. I told them that they should prepare the kalbi tang with the meat cut off, I mean the meat is one of the best parts oft he stew. I can never shake off the feelings of humiliation to return to this restaurant.  I give this place 3 stars because I know that they are new and have really good potential."}
{"text":"Usually went to this restaurant, and ordered The Army Style Hot Pot every time. There was one time I tried to find the rice cake in it, and asked the waiter where is it, and she said \"we run out of it\". And this time this happened again, and the waiter took a bowl filling with this different shape rice cake with mould on every piece of it. And throw it right into the hot pot in one third second. Good job Gogi. Last time being here."}
{"text":"Not recommended really. I love Korean food and BBQ but this place is understaffed and busy. The food is average. Not great. It needs a complete makeover. The bathrooms are gross right next to the kitchen. Makes no sense. They keep food in big bowls right next to the bathroom. Can't imagine that will last long. It's a Korean thing I guess. Don't know though. We don't have to be that authentic. More wait staff and cleaning overhaul and I'll come back eventually."}
{"text":"very delicious place definitely love the large portion sizes.  our server was very nice and fast. first time visiting for my husband and I . got seated right away and food came out quickly we ordered the hot stone pork so big with sides and a delicious steamed egg we also ordered two sushi rolls a Philly roll and Las Vegas  roll so big we had to get it to go. will definitely  be back :)"}
{"text":"My 2nd & 3rd go round at Gogi was better than the first. The service has definitely improved. I really appreciate that.   We had an appetizer of tempura. I don't want to nitpick but honestly I have to. Tempura is fried I get it but it shouldn't be greasy. So greasy it ran down my face when I bit into it.   We had servings of seafood and pork tofu soup. I recommend the seafood as the pork soup the meat was very dry and didn't work with the soup.   In addition we had the shrimp, bulgogi and spicy pork hot stone. I recommend the spicy pork - the bulgogi I got a taste of too much sesame oil but maybe it was an off day. The hot stone bowls are so generous that it could feed a small village. Some days I'm that small village.   Drinks are pretty standard. I didn't have any but my friends had some soju which was said to be room temperature when they got their shot glass but I imagine it would have been decent chilled. They weren't bombing it into their beer glasses.   The ban chan was lacking but there was enough ordered items to fill our hungry souls. It didn't look appetizing and starting to get that grey - I've been sitting in the cold too long look.   We took our other friends here for the first time and they enjoyed it so much they went back within the week to try other dishes.   The atmosphere and service: Still clean and acceptable. I am self conscience and I felt welcome here and the staff appeared to be very humble and welcoming compared to my first time here. I have yet to use the bathrooms here but I'm told they are pretty clean. Hoping for my next return to be 5 stars.   What I would change: egg souffl√© all day - they didn't have any and my aunt who doesn't consume meats was super sad."}
{"text":"GOGi has been my \"GO TO\" for Korean food since I arrived in Chandler, AZ, and I have to say this place is one of the most authentic Korean places in the eastern valley/Phoenix area. Luckily, during my stay here in Chandler it turned out to be 5 minutes from my house. I find myself eating a lot more Korean food these days and loving it!  I am originally from the Orange County, CA area and I am a Korean/American Hapa so I have some insight and judgment skills regarding authentic Korean cuisine. My father and aunties were first generation from Seoul and frequently cooked for our family. My favorite Auntie Jung would often prepare and serve extra Japchae for me at family gatherings or for my birthday celebrations.  Essentially, GOGi can best be described in 3 words \"Authentic, fresh, and delicious!\"  The Food is: well spiced, but not too much garlic. I mean the next day your friends won't be like, \"Shit, what the hell did you eat last night?\" The Japchae, Kim Chee Pancakes, Bulgogi, Bibimbap, and Soft Tofu spicy soup are all authentic and delicious. My boyfriend Seth and good friend Aimee enjoyed the fresh fish salad, and also found it to be delicious, authentic, and fresh also. Oh yes, and the portion is huge on this dish, so plan to share unless you are especially hungry.  The Side Dishes: (know as banchan): are delicious including the fresh Kim Chee, and when I say fresh I mean it! I called to inquire about purchasing sides of Kim Chee to have around my house for my boyfriend and I to enjoy with our Asian Fusion meals at home. However, they responded in saying they would run out of Kim Chee if they sold it that way. What run out of Kim Chee?!!! That would be unethical to rob some poor soul of their fresh Kim Chee experience. No way!!!!  The Portions: again, GOGI serves the most generous portions I have ever encountered when dining Korean Cuisine, and I have eaten Korean all over the place!  The Atmosphere: your standard authentic Korean atmosphere: bizarre deco that makes no sense lol, many Korean servers speaking Korean amongst themselves and smiling and bowing a lot. You may even see monitors or big screens without any sound or with Korean videos, if you are lucky haha! You may here authentic Korean music in the background.   The Service: was awesome! My servers always approach me smiling and eager to help and understand my order. The last time I went in late night with my boyfriend after drinking way too many drinks the server complimented me-Wow! What more can you ask for. Try this place-It's Authentic, fresh, and delicious Korean cuisine!"}
{"text":"Yummy Korean food and amazing sides! I got Galbi (Korean short ribs), spicy pork belly, and tofu seafood soup. The soup includes tofu, clam, squid, mussel, and top with an egg. Tofu is very soft to my likeness. The spicy pork belly is not too spicy and very flavorful. The short rib seasoning is a little bit bland. My favorite sides are kim chi, tofu, and potato. The rest of the sides are a bit bland.. I highly recommend this place if you really like Korean food."}
{"text":"Went in with my honey on a thursday night. Our server, I believe her name was Amy (Aimee?) and she was fantastic! Seeing as I am in the industry, I tend to take notice to certain standards of service and our server was one of the best servers I've ever had. I ordered some sake ( the sweetest cold one they have) and it was Amazing! Our food came out super fast and I really liked the little condiment bowls that came to the table. The salmon was amazing.  My honey really enjoyed his huge platter of meat and rice.  Everything was great! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I hate them automatic charges on my bill for 18% tip. I never come back again at GOGI."}
{"text":"This place was a very lucky find for my family when we were traveling around Chandler. Located in the Lee Lee shopping center that hosts several other restaurants, this intersection has become the best Asian food destination in all of Arizona. Although there are not many Japanese restaurants, I nevertheless wish I lived closer! I ordered the spicy squid and pork belly from their lunch menu. It was absolutely the best. The platter held a generous portion and was beautifully plated. The squid was cooked perfectly: not too chewy but still had a nice bite. Delightfully paired with the squid, the seasoned, leaner cuts of pork belly tasted heavenly. My taste buds were dancing from my meal with all the different flavors of the banchan infusing with my entree. The dining room was packed and lively with televisions showing fun K-Pop music videos. It was a great dining experience, and I will be coming back each time I visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"I love the spicy pork belly and the spicy pork bulgogi here at Gogi. The hot stone bibimbap is also good. A year ago, the service was very slow and not that good. Recently, however, it's the opposite. The last couple of visits has been great, maybe because I arrive right when the restaurant open. Servers were very attentive and food orders does not take forever to arrive at out table."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this place yet? A definite part of our work lunch rotation when we're actually really hungry - because you get a lot of food - your order, the banchan, and sometimes some complementary egg. Sometimes someone in our group wants sushi while someone else hates sushi but will order the meats. So this place sort of satisfies everybody in the group. I usually get the Korean food choices. So far I've had the Fresh Water Eel Hot Stone Rice Bowl, the Spicy Pork Belly, Oxtail Soup, Kalbi, and probably a few I've forgotten. The food has always been good. We leave pretty satisfied each time. Service is sometimes very good and sometimes lacking but that's usually only when they're shorthanded. They have a handful of booths and a number of round tables that can seat four people. Two large screens that usually show news. This place is closer for us than Hodori and Chodang so that pretty much seals it that they will be the ones satisfying our Korean food cravings. It's in the same mall as Lee Lee's on the NE corner of Warner and Dobson. Parking is plentiful but watch out - the parking lot itself is a wreck! It's full of potholes and areas that are badly in need of resurfacing."}
{"text":"I like coming here for the non-BBQ Korean food. They have a good selection of food here. My favorite one to get is their pork belly with cabbage. When going with big groups of people, we always end up ordering a second round of this. Definitely recommend.   Their dolsot bibimbaps are pretty decent. But, as mentioned by others/shown in pictures, these come in a HUGE stone pot so unless you haven't eaten for days, expect leftovers.   This is located in the same plaza as Lee Lee's. The parking area in front of the restaurant is very limited and always full."}
{"text":"I already can't wait to go back to GOGI and try more things on their menu. So yummy!!!  Hubby and a friend went with the pork and bulgogi hot stone bowl. I'm pretty sure the bowls were about 10 inches in diameter, so definitely huge portions. More importantly, it was delicious (hubby allowed me a bite) and I loved how the rice got a little crispy from the heat of the bowl. I went with the spicy squid and pork belly and was in heaven!!  They also brought out a bunch of sides which came with the meal - fish cake, radish, potato, kimchi...awesome variety!!  We went on a Friday night right around 5 and were only one of a couple small groups within the restaurant. By 5:30, the place was packed, so I recommend going early. Next time, hot pot is on my list to try!!"}
{"text":"First time here tonight with the family. Couldn't decide if we wanted Pho or Chinese food and then we spotted this Korean/Sushi restaurant.  We are def. coming back! The food was delish! The meat was juicy/tender. I know most restaurants don't give you extra charge for wanting more rice, this restaurant does, but its all good.  Randomly our waitress gave us steamed egg soup that we didn't order and said \"It's on the house\". That's awesome! Thank you! And when we were halfway done with our meal, she gave us another order of the egg steamed soup and said \"Since you have a bigger party, we'd like to give you another\" which was awesome. Thank you again!  The service was good!"}
{"text":"Really great Korean food.  Unpretentious atmosphere with friendly staff and good prices.  It's great to have a place like this in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Best Korean food in AZ. I've been waiting for a restaurant worthy of the East Valley Korean title belt; hodori and chodang always fell a bit short. GOGI has finally satisfied my need!  I went with a group of friends last night and we had the soon tofu, haemul pajun, bulgogi, assorted caviar stone rice bowl, and bibim nengmyun (buckwheat noodles). We also had the sushi which was all very fresh. The food was all great. And the unlimited sides were all yummy too.  I would definitely recommend this place and be coming as a regular."}
{"text":"I've been to GOGI on multiple occasions. Food is always great, but I always thought that the service was just ok. Everyone there is as friendly as can be but at busy times they just seem to be all over the place, rushing and sometimes forgetting things. My recent experience with them though has completely won me over.  A few months ago i went there with some family and friends, at least 15 of us. It was a busy  night and we were seated in the patio. They didn't seem like they could handle all the tables there that night and was really slow throughout the whole dinner: providing utensils, bringing out food, ringing up the bill. They realized that they provided poor service and promised us 20% off on our next visit (written on a receipt.)   Months after that night, I went back with my family. Same large party, but completely different experience. We expected to just have the same dishes that we normally get (we can't get enough of that Sweet Pork Belly.) Soon after we placed our orders we realized that they remembered us from last time we visited. While we waited for our orders, they brought a few things for us to try. Steamed egg, seafood pancakes, and chicken katsu salad. They said that they wanted to make up for last time and that those were all on the house. Service was much better this time around with multiple waiters being attentive and when we got the check, they already took 20% off and just asked me to turn in the note he gave us last time.   Like I said, food is always great here. What they lacked in customer service in previous visits they more than made up for this time around. It was a classy gesture and I appreciate that they appreciate their customers."}
{"text":"Great Japanese, and i think Korean, fusion place! I want to try everything on their menu! Sister got the porkbelly hot plate and i got the pork belly &squid dish. They came with lil side dishes to enhance all the delicious flavors. The server was helpful in decribing the menu items (on our first times, we usually grill the employees on what's good). The prices were slightly higher than we thought ( we're used to cheap Chinese food, i guess) but the portions were BIG! Classy metal chopsticks are hard to get a grip on, especially if you're hungry, but the staff was very attentive... i asked for a fork and the damage was DONE! Haha. Great food, service, and when it comes to price- you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. The service was fast and friendly and the food was beyond delicious. I'm looking forward to trying as many of the menu items as possible."}
{"text":"It's Korean food, nothing was \"off\" and I'm actually a little impressed that there's a place like this in the area. That said, it's not an knock your socks off place, but it's definitely good."}
{"text":"This is a great Korean and sushi joint. My wife liked their sushi the most here out of all the places in az we have been. The service was great and the prices were reasonable. The portions are large. We got the army stew and it was enough to feed 4 hungry adults. Great flavor and came in a hot pot. It was great. They were playing k dramas on the tvs.  Located on the side of the building marked on yelp."}
{"text":"It was my first time here for lunch, after hearing tons of good reviews and recommendations from my friends. Gotta say I wasn't disappointed! :)  The interior is spacious, nice and clean; unlike other typical smoky asian/korean BBQ places. The staff was very attentive and helpful. We ordered the spicy pork bellies and spicy squid and pork bellies with rice combos. Our orders came out about 10-15 mins afterward with all the side dishes. I specifically really enjoyed the steamed eggs. On the other hand, I didn't care too much for the sausage side dish.   The only thing I was confused was the fact that my spicy pork bellies combo and my dad's spicy squid and pork bellies combo cost the same. Look at the picture you will understand. My dad's order was almost double my order size.   Overall, everything was great! Food was really tasty. Awesome service. Nice ambient. Decent price. Will definitely come back and recommend to others."}
{"text":"I used to love their food, but recently the service was just horrible. Last time I went to the restaurant, it took a while to receive our order and they forgot the small dishes that I needed to ask for them- which was fine cause they were under staffed. But today, I was seated, waited for more than 10 mins- oh I checked my phone so I was very sure I waited for mk ore than 10 mins- no water, no menu no utensil. Me and my family was completely ignored- even when we stood up and waved our hands to raise attention of the waitresses... The understaffed situation has become ridiculous. I give it two stars because the food is still good...if you have time to wait and don't care about poor service"}
{"text":"I've never eaten Korean food before, but I tell you I will be back to this place. I order the chicken Bulgogi lunch special and was very impressed with the amount of food that was served. The waitress brought out a variety of sides: potatoes, kimchi, zucchini, cucumbers, and tofu. All we're delicious! I will warn you that if you are super sensitive to spicy, the side dishes may be a little hard to eat. I cannot handle a lot of spice and still able to enjoy it with water close to me. The Chicken Bulgogi is a tad sweet which counter balanced the spicy sides well. One of my favorite aspects was that the rice was served on the side, which allowed me to skip the carbs."}
{"text":"The food is great. Love the food but guess what? My bill came up to 18.59 and I paid with two $20 dollars cash, $40 dollars total and asked for 15 back. My server thought I gave him only one twenty and still thought I was asking for $15 back. It looked like the owners were the one handling the cash. They did their drawer calculations and claimed that I only gave them one twenty dollar bill. I am a server and I handle cash all day. The server told me he had only been serving for a month so it makes sense as to why he could have mishandled the money but the owners seemed to be the one handling all of the transactions and they still calculated that I only gave them $20. I felt bad and still left 5 bucks for a tip. Pay with card so they don't accuse you of ripping them off with cash!  I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"It's been nearly 4 years since I last ate here and I was very happy to come back to have dinner with a friend. I ordered the fried rice, she ordered the bibimbap , and both shared the sweet and sour korean fried chicken. The portions are reasonable almost pretty good for what you get. The beef fried rice comes with a fried egg atop and it was surprisingly good. It's hard to find a good place that makes delicious fried rice and these guys definitely got it on the mark. The bibimbap was also really flavorful, and cause of the stone pot the rice gets crispy on the bottom to scrape up like how you dig for screenshots to expose someone. The KFC is served after 5PM fyi so come thru to get destroyed, you ain't down. The sauce was really good and the chicken breading was crispy. Definitely happy I came back cause I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Food is the best in az. But the service though, it was amazing. My server's name was Chris and he made sure we had the best experience. Also, did i mention he was good looking"}
{"text":"Was sadly disappointed.  Everything was soggy and overly sweet, from banchans to bibimbap to japchae to the soon tofu.  Could hardly finish our meal.  Galbi was just ok.  There weren't that many people there at 8pm and yet service was pretty slow.  No one refilled water or banchans."}
{"text":"I was excited to try their food- my friends have been raving about this place for a while! We were seated and well taken care of by the staff.   I ordered a beef rice cake soup upon recommendation, but can't say that I was extremely impressed. The bowl was mostly filled with bland broth and green onions, with less meat and rice cakes than I was expecting. Of the meat that was there, most of the pieces were extremely fatty.   My friend ordered a chicken bibimbap. When I tried a bite, I could see why people were so impressed with the restaurant! So much flavor and variety, and a huge portion of food at a good price.  I will be coming back to give the restaurant another try. Next time, I'll be ordering bibimbap!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! I was skeptical at first, but the dishes are fantastic! The spicy chicken bulgogi was my favorite. However, the service was slow. Really put a damper on lunch."}
{"text":"Hot stone rice is one of the best!! Spicy squid and pork belly is awesome!!! Much better than other Korean restaurants in Arizona, especially those in Tucson!!!"}
{"text":"This place is HELLLLLAAAA good!!! My sister and I came here and ordered the whole shop! Everything was bomb delicious and the service was awesome  We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Just went to Korea in April. Despite being in the middle of the desert, the food was very similar to what I had in Korea! Took my family out for a flavor tour of Korea. Friendly service and fresh, delicious food. I could probably eat here every day."}
{"text":"Came here with the family as we were really in the mood for good Korean food. Seeing 4 stars on Yelp,we headed over. My Nang Myun was okay, but the rest of my family wasn't impressed. The Kalbi was not very flavorful, just a few Ban Chan, and the Kim Chi fried rice was horrible.  Every Korean restaurant I've been to, will flood your table with Ban Chan. As other reviews have mentioned, the service isn't that great either."}
{"text":"I admit that I have such a mistake going here around noon time. The restaurant is extremely crowded with only 2 waitstaff, and I finally get to order my food in 20mins since I step in. There are not many authentic Korean cuisines in the East Valley; but I have visited some within my residence, and I would say this place does not stand out from the rest. My lunch selections are Bulbogi, beef fried rice, and beef tofu soup (Lunch options). Zucchini and fish cake side plates taste awesome, and the other 3 are pretty acceptable. The Bulgogi is great and the thinned texture of meat absorbs the spices , but beef fried rice is very greasy with dried cubed beef, which makes it hard to chew. The tofu in the soup is starting to turn sour, and the rice from the combo is also dry and not so good.   Being short of staff really makes the dining experience a challenge. Despite the waiter keeps apologizing for the delay (and I totally understand), there's nothing in this place can keep me to come back."}
{"text":"Gogi is one of my favorite Korean restaurants in the valley. I live in Phoenix, and I make the drive to Chandler just so I can have their delicious bibimbap. I love that their hot stone bowl is made in a way that makes the rice in the bottom crispier than usual (I don't know if that's possible) but it makes the whole dish more amazing. There's just enough amount of meat, vegetables and rice. My boyfriend had pork belly and it literally melted in their mouths. The complimentary appetizers are great. The service is mediocre, and the prices are affordable."}
{"text":"I have been here twice within a short period of tome. The food is delicious. I have tried the galbi, hot stone chicken and hot stone bulgogi. The meat is seasoned very well and tender.  I am usually not a stickler for service but the service I received was not that attentive. I didn't get my drink refilled once. When I asked what the specials were my waitress told me they were on the board in front of the restaurant and walked away.  Additionally for some reason the last time I ate at Gogi, it was very hot inside."}
{"text":"The food is ok. The side dishes are ok. The service is horrible. You have to \"catch\" one of the staff members walk by or else you'll sit there completely ignored. The same 3 k-pop songs and music videos were on repeat during our dinner. It was too much."}
{"text":"Items Ordered:  Usually Bulgogi Bibimbap, Spicy Pork Belly or Galbi.  Total Bill: $35 lunch; $55 dinner  Level of Satisfaction: High Mediocre  Quick Tips:   - Do not eat here for dinner.  Portions are the same as lunch and cost nearly twice as much.   - We never get personal or really good service here.  Just mediocre.  We are ratings Gogi 3 stars but we want to elaborate.  If we were just rating the food, they get a 5 stars hands down.  The food is so good and the only thing we have had but didn't enjoy was the fish katsu.  It had way too many bones to truly enjoy.  But the bibimbap, the bulgogi, and galbi all will make your mouth water just to write about.  Yes, I'm salivating now!  The service however.  Not so great.  Seems like you need to be a \"friend of the family\" to get really good service.  We almost feel not welcome walking in.  The second complaints is the difference between dinner and lunch prices.  After originally going for a lunch and then returning for another visit at dinner time, we clearly noticed the huge bill and lack of larger portions.  So overall...totally worth a visit but set reasonable expectations and only go for lunch."}
{"text":"This is as good as Korean food can get in AZ. It's a great place to grab some Korean beer or soju while enjoying some familiar Korean entrees."}
{"text":"Food is good and delicious but the service lacks! I sat with no water refill for most of my meal and did not get a refill until I asked them for one. Nobody came to check to see how we were doing except the teen waiter. Mind you, there were two other servers there and they were not very busy at all. Although the food is good, service should improve as it is one of the main components of the restaurant business.   I won't be back even for the delicious food. I give them 3 stars for the food."}
{"text":"where was korean food all my life?? haha yeah friend referred me here and had to try it. was amazing. now this was my 3rd time being here already. i order the beef tartare bibimbap hot stone!! soo delicious! i recommend this place for sure!!"}
{"text":"TLDR: Good, large portions of food for a low price. There is also a lot of variety so go for groups.  A Korean/Japanese fusion restaurant way off on the side of the Lee Lee's plaza. It's kind of hard to find if you haven't been there because their signage isn't very good, but just keep walking towards the end of the strip until you find it.  Went there once with a group for family style and once just with a friend. I think I liked the family style option more because I got to try more dishes. I usually only want one or two things on any menu at most so making ordering decisions aren't too hard for me, but this place has a lot of options. I liked my dish the second time I went, but I was curious about what the other dishes entrees tasted like.  The portions were huge both times. My friend ordered a bulgogi and it came out in the usual portions but she couldn't even finish half of it. I've seen her eat before and I know she doesn't have trouble finishing her plate, but this time, she started struggling before she could even make a dent in the meat.  Definitely want to go back to this place next time I'm in the area. A little bit sad that I didn't find this place until after I left AZ but nice to have another restaurant to look forward to."}
{"text":"This place has slowly improved over the years. I came during their grand opening and had a horrible experience with expensive and small portions.  My second time was about a year after that and there was dramatic improvement.  The Korean chirashi was only $10 - cheapest I've had.  The portion was large but the salad part was mostly cabbage which is unusual and didnt taste as good.  Came back tonight (2 years later) and there was further improvement. That same Korean Chirashi had large slices of sashimi and some cabbage but this time lots of real mixed greens.  This time the amount of sweet spicy sauce was way too excessive and drowned the salad.  Their sauce is also sweeter than I prefer so I will need to ask for the sauce on side next time like how it is usually served. Easy fix and still cheap $11.  My tofu soup was decent and only $8.99.  Not sure if I like it enough to be back but it's a decent place overall."}
{"text":"Tried their late night chicken bar! I love me some KFC(Korean fried Chicken)!! The Sweet and Spicy sauce is what I would recommend! It's the red  fried chicken sauce you see at other korean spots! If you're familiar with it..  but I did the half and half? Which is two flavors for one chicken? The other flavor I got was the Garlic chicken!  The flavor was good but the chicken was borderline dry..  and I wish they mix the chicken pieces better.. all the white meat had the red sauce and while the garlic chicken had all the dark meat..   Overall, I would have given it a 3.5 but I rounded it up to 4 for speed and customer service.   Can't find a menu for it anywhere online so I took a picture for y'all."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time after hearing about them and we were super stoked to have Korean food within reach! I ordered the bibimbap and my hubby ordered bulgogi. We had a nice man be our server and he did a good job asking us if we had questions the menu was a little confusing and I wish they had pictures because of the descriptions were not all entirely clear. When we ordered our drinks they came in a can where we had to pour it in the cup, I was not a huge fan of that at all because while we were waiting for our food we were never asked if we wanted a refill or knew how that worked. The food came out in a timely manner and looked very nice with the plating, my bibimbap was good but it was not the best I've had since I felt like it was premade ahead of time a long time ago versus making it right then and there, my hubby's bulgogi was very good the meat was tender and had good flavor but he was not found of the chopsticks as he struggled. As we were having our meals we were never asked if we wanted a refill and as I looked for the sever he was in the corner talking to the other servers and not paying attention to us as we were the only other people in the restaurant and it was not busy at all.  As the bill came out it was written in Korean and we couldn't understand what we were charged for.... I wish they had something where we could see our bill since our bill was a little high. To be courteous we did tip our server but we probably won't be going back for a little while unless we are craving bulgogi but I'll pass on the bibimbap"}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago with my friends. The food was great, service was spectacular, and I had a fun time. Would definitely come again"}
{"text":"I was craving something different the other night and thought back to eating a hot stone bowl at a small place in London. I thought that there wasn't a place in the valley like it, and I was so wrong!  We walked in later in the evening on a Friday, and were immediately seated. Our server was so warm and attentive (actually everyone in this restaurant is amazingly sweet).  This is a cute and affordable date place. Literally, we ordered two meals and an appetizer and had leftovers for two days. I really think you could get away with one entree and be fine. I had a chicken hot stone bowl and it was so good! I love the crispy rice underneath and how colorful it all was. We also got a seafood pancake and I've been day dreaming about it. It comes with this sweet jalape√±o soy dipping sauce, and you see huge chunks of octopus and lots of scallions.   I did not order any sushi or dessert, but I will be back in the near future."}
{"text":"My favorite Korean restaurant in Arizona hands down. Service is excellent and food quality is great. My favorite thing to order here is the bulgogi and the bulgogi hot pot they're so tender and flavorful. FYI the soup pots look to have about 4-5 servings in them. But its always nice having leftovers to take home."}
{"text":"I love Korean dramas. Overly emotional soap operas with cute boys and odd hairstyles. In my Korean dramas, people are ALWAYS eating - kimchi fried rice, seaweed soup, seafood pancakes, and so on. After watching my favorite actors and actresses eat so much, I became curious about Korean food. A quick search on yelp brought me to Gogi.  Gogi is delicious. I'm not a Korean food connoisseur, and I cannot vouch on the authenticity of the food, but it's delicious. I had the oxtail soup and spicy pork belly - so flavorful!   However, I'll have to limit my visits to special occasions because this place is expensive! Maybe that's why my favorite characters get so excited when the boss takes them out to dinner..."}
{"text":"Great good, friendly staff. I've tried soondubu, galbi, and pork belly. All great, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love the bulgogi hot stone plate here! Rice, vegetables, and bbq beef over a sizzling stone plate, you really can't go wrong with that combo! The side dishes are great as well, especially the kimchi. We always get very sweet servers as well--very good service."}
{"text":"great food (is there any bad korean BBQ?)  go at lunch, the waitress says it's the same portions, just $5 cheaper/entree dough!"}
{"text":"Finally a great Korean fix!  Spicy kimchi always hits the spot :) I ordered the chicken bulgogi and it was accompanied by small veggie side dishes.  The portions are good sized, the food is very flavorful and the service was welcoming and very nice. I am sure to be a regular here.  :)"}
{"text":"Currently I am sitting in this restaurant with a COLD hot stone pot. Update to posted after this sadness."}
{"text":"That was my first Korean food so I don't know if it was good or not Korean-wise. I like it anyways. A little expensive though."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Korean food.  We came today and had the stone pot bulgogi rice, the tofu soup, galbi, another order of Bulgogi, and fried dumplings.  Everything was done to perfection.  Banchan was also decent.  They kimchee had great flavor.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So we decided to go there for lunch again and once again had a bad experience.  It's too bad because it's just so close to our house.  Here were the issues: 1. The server waited on tables that came after us. 2.  We had to flag our server to put in our order. 3.  The menu item Cold Noodles with Spicy Sauce is not described correctly.  The dish comes with a huge layer of salad, some noodles, and a bunch of carrots on top.  If the dish says cold noodles in spicy sauce, I expect just that. We will no longer come here again and we suggest that you don't either!"}
{"text":"I really love this place, like this  place is one of my husband and I's favs. Each and every time I go I have a great experience. The food always tastes amazing and I love bringing in new people to feed the addiction! My personal favorite is the spicy pork belly, but I haven't had anything here I haven't liked. I thank my coworker often to alerting me to this tasty eatery. The waiters and staff are friendly and will gladly explain the menu if you have any questions. Very fair prices considering how much food you get! Try it and enjoy! ^_^"}
{"text":"My compliments to the chef.. They helped me with a catering job and did a wonderful job!! Fresh, plenty and very tasty!! We love Gogis!!"}
{"text":"Growing up in nyc and moving to AZ last year. I was craving authentic korean food, best korean restaurant in arizona. if you visit the restaurant, look around the kitchen area. the owner are cooking every meal. don't forget to ask egg soup (Gaeran Jim) which comes with every meal. the meals are twice the size of east coast portion. highly recommended."}
{"text":"I went in today for the first time, after reading very good reviews. I had the Octopus salad as an appetizer and then Galbi. Both dishes were really good, as were the side dishes. The salad was big. Service was a tad slow, but the servers were truly busy with many other tables. I know, that I will be back. The server brought me a complimentary egg dish at the end of the meal. I could not eat it though, because I was so full. I took it home."}
{"text":"Excellent! Ordered 3 vegetarian dishes, a buckwheat noodle, a rice dish, and a spicy potato noodle. All were great and had generous portions. Very nice service and appetizers as well. Also had a nice selection of saki. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place has the best  !!!! Aka gojujang samgyeopsal (spicy pork belly) and I really don't like samgyeopsal at all. Theirs is to die for. I haven't been here in a so long so I really must go back! Their  (bibimbap) is huge! And sooo so good. Love their noodles and stews and wow I just want to go there RIGHT NOW but alas it is 4am haha. Definitely check it out! One of the best in Arizona!"}
{"text":"We are still sitting in the restaurant but I felt the need the go ahead and post.   I brought the hubby here for his birthday because we like to try new places and were craving Korean food. SO GLAD I FOUND THIS PLACE!   The reviews had people complaining about the service or the time it takes for the food to come out.  Service was actually pretty decent for a Korean place. They were friendly and always working and kept busy. When I really needed something I was able to stop someone and they brought it right away.  The food did take a bit, but it wasn't even as long as most other Korean places I have been to. Everything is always made when it is ordered and quality food takes a while. I make this type of food at home and it is an all day event. Everything we ordered was really good and reminded me of my father's cooking when he was alive.   Our table was visited by an awesome sweet lady and we thought she was the owner, turns out she is his sister and was just helping out for the night.  We will definitely be making this place our go to for Korean food! And it saves me from having to spend all day in the kitchen. Don't be discouraged by timing, just make sure you have plenty of time to enjoy."}
{"text":"Gogi is a superb stop for amazing and fresh Korean food, excellent service and good atmosphere. Everything is served fresh and in a timely manner. And their kim chi is second to none, You cant go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"This place knows what they are doing. Staff is friendly and service is excellent. The portions are large and shareable. I always get chicken yaki soba. So good."}
{"text":"The food was very good. There were many good choices.  All choices are good.  But what made it three stars is the service was bad waiter was inattentive.  Entertainment sucks creepy TV shows and had bugs in seating areas."}
{"text":"Gogi offers two of my favorite Korean dishes, bulgogi and bi bim bap, in one delicious massive stone bowl.   Located in the same shopping center as Lee Lee's, Gogi shares a name with one of my favorite Phoenix Suns basketball players.   Can anyone say marketing opportunity?  Offering plenty of space to patrons, Gogi is a fine addition to the Korean food scene here in the Valley of the Sun."}
{"text":"GOGI offers authentic Korean food! My party and I ordered off their lunch menu. We had the beef tofu soup and spicy pork combo and bulgogi. Just like any other Korean restaurant, our meal came with side dishes. Serving size was good and flavor was on point also! Everything was really yummy! I just wish it was hotter, our platter wasn't sizzling.. but it could be an off day or maybe that's just how it comes.. I highly recommend the spicy pork! Service was average. Came by to take out order, brought out the food, and then the check. Other Korean places, constantly refill side dishes without asking.. this place never checked up on us besides giving us the check.."}
{"text":"I really like this place, and I drive out here just to eat and then head back to Phoenix.  I've been here 3 or 4 times now, and my last visit they forgot/misplaced my order so while my girlfriend finished up her meal they had just started up mine. At which point I just asked to cancel it so we could pay and go. I'm guessing the servers were a bit flustered (it happens, I've worked in the service industry for years), but they didn't seem concerned about the mishap and well, it made me wanting to return very low on the priority scale."}
{"text":"The restaurant is pleasant with a clean interior and a friendly staff and what I am told by my Korean friends an authentic Korean cuisine,  It was a busy Saturday night and we were the only caucasian diners among many 20 - 30 something orientals, laughing, happy and boisterous.  I guess you can say grandpa crashed their party. We ordered Spicy Pork Bulgogi with the accompanying sides of Kimchi of cabage,  marinated potato  and another kimchi of sweet potatoes, pickled beansprouts and one that had a fishy taste.  They all tasted very good except for the fishy one.  The pork dish was a good sized portion, not at all spicy and the meat had just a hint of freezer burn taste to it, but edible.  We decided that we were not fans of Korean cuisine.  Our friends ate Bibimbap, a heated stone bowled rice dish with meat and veggies and an egg on top.  They liked it a lot but were accustomed to this type of cooking. There was enough food for each couple to share a dish!  Please don't use my review to not eat here because the flavors were not great for us, I imagine it's an acquired taste."}
{"text":"Try the soon tofu soup combos!! So much food, and so much flavor!  Love the assortment of Kimchi too."}
{"text":"First time and we will now become regulars. Family operated with excellent, friendly and fast service. Best Kimchi we've had in the Phoenix area. The seafood soup had amazingly rich flavor and a nice spicy kick to it. We also had the hot stone rice bowl with Bulgogi on it.  I honestly don't think I ever had a Korean dish that was better. Thank you for a wonderful dining experience! We will be back."}
{"text":"Updated review: 3 stars What a disappointing downfall... what used to be one of my favorite Korean restaurant is less and less enjoyable. A couple new servers have been hired and I truly dislike an arrogant service. There especially one Asian lady who is just terrible... she is killing this business. The food has not changed and is still excellent. When I come to a restaurant, I like to choose my seat and I am shocked this has became \"¬† sit here or go away...¬†\"  Initial review: 5 stars After going a few times to Korea, let me put it this way: The food served in Gogi is as good, even better than family owned restaurants in Korea. This is an authentic Korean culinary experience! If people expect fast food service, forget it: This is not Panda Express Korean Version! I will be back and the waiting time is worth it. The service was busy, but nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I love KBBQ and tried dozens this is definitely the most authentic one i have ever been to. I tried the beef fried rice and bulgogi of course. Both were amazing and its awesome how you can go next door and get snow afterward oye even to lee lees and get your own ingredients to make it at home.  I always love going down here to eat and would highly recommend for authentic quality food."}
{"text":"I fell in love with the kimchi here, but ever since the change in ownership, some of the food does taste a little bit different. The servers here are always nice and always provides us with a bigger plate of kimchi. The galbi is probably the best thing I've ever had there. They are a little pricy when it's dinner time but sometimes, it's definitely worth it. I think this is one of the best Korean restaurant I can find in the Chandler area."}
{"text":"Late post ...I wanted to try this place for a while and finally did.  I was anticipating the food would be excellent for such good reviews.  Unfortunately, it was just ok.  I ordered the bulgogi for lunch. It lack flavors and was dry.  I also ordered spicy pork bulgogi and calamari. It was the same and was not at all spicy.  The calamari was just ok nothing special just plain. They waiter never came around to check for refills either and my cup was empty for a while."}
{"text":"This family owned Korean restaurant  has, in my opinion, the best Korean food in the Valley. Great menu choices, generous portions and tasty food. Service can be a little slow but I think that they have worked out some of the kinks and I do see improvement in this area. I am definitely a regular at this establishment and will recommend to anyone looking for decent Korean food."}
{"text":"Fast service (although maybe because I came in pretty late around 9pm) with short waiting time for food! Wonderful! :D Servers are nice and cute ;)   I had a solid meal here. What I like most is that they have entree+tofu soup combo! And you can choose whatever tofu soup they have! For an Asian, it starts to feel like meal when there's a main dish, some small cold dishes and a soup! Many other places don't have these options. If you want both then get both with full price. But here a small sized soup really makes a difference.   Even though it's a smaller size soup, the materials were solid. It doesn't feel like a cheap add-on side, but really a smaller version of the real thing. I had seafood tofu soup with egg, mussel, clams and a real size shrimp, not like some other Korean restaurant nowadays that use small shrimpies and substitute mussel with small clams even in a full price soup. The flavors are pretty good. I can't say it's the best or it's outstanding, but the attitude here is better than many.   I will come back and would recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"Gogi is probably the finest Korean restaurant in town at the time this review is written. I've had Korean food in Korea and Bay area so my expectation could be a little high."}
{"text":"Great Korean food.  Can't stand typical American patrons who expect Dennys and receive amazing Korean food.  This place always gives you what you pay for, authentic, Korean food.  Great place, family run business that deserves respect."}
{"text":"Place is busy and the owner are getting sloppy.  Bad service and so so food.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I came to Gogi when it first opened and our service was so horrible that I haven't came back until recently. I was really craving some nice cold nengmyun and my friend and I decided to come give this place a try. The restaurant was not very busy and we were seated right away. When we tried to order the nengmyun the server said they ran out. We were supper bummed and we're getting ready to leave. My friend and I were trying to find other Korean restaurants that had it but most of them are closed on a Tuesday so we really didn't have much options to pick from. Thankfully our server came back and said they just made some broth so we were able to get it. Our food came out fairly fast and the side dishes were good. My favorite was the steamed egg they brought out! Everything about our dish looked yummy! The broth was really flavorful , the noodles were soft and I liked that they gave us more then one piece of meat. I don't understand why restaurants do that for some of their dishes.  Anyways it definitely satisfied my cravings and it was the perfect way to beat the heat. This time my experience was way better then the one I had a couple of years ago and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great Korean food, according to my friends from LA, this place serves authentic Korean food. We ordered the pork belly with Napa, soft shelled crab, seafood pot, squid and many other items. It all delicious which made my friends and I went back to have some more. Friendly staff and cozy atmosphere, great place to hang out with friends and have couple beer n sakes."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Bell Biv Devoe - Poison)  Hey I must tell you......! I sense something tasty in my mouth Situation is serious......! Let's try it cause we're running out of time It's oh so delicious.....! Bo Bites reviews they seem from the start It's all so lyrical......! When food is ready from the start  It's driving me out of my mind! That's why it's not hard for me to try Can't get it out of my mouth Miss it, taste it, love it That place is GOGI......!  Solid! Solid as a rock!    GOGI delivers to me in my book...and palate!  Located in the heart of what I call the Phoenix Asian mecca, GOGI's location is perfect to showcase to the Asian community.  GOGI's is modern and subtle like a model home display.  Not my cup of tea I guess.  Service was spot on though and very attentive and helpful when my buddy and I needed some suggestions.    We started with the Seafood Pancakes, which came with a ponzu-like sauce in a bowl full of jalapeno peppers.  Overall a nice start, the pancakes were nice and soft in the middle and crunchy at the edges with small cuts of calamari giving it some extra texture.  For our entree with shot for the Spicy Pork Belly and the Bulgogi Beef Hot Stone Bowl.  Boy did we hit the jackpot!  The Spicy Pork Belly was somewhat fatty, but overall the taste was music to my palates.  Tender with a hint of chewiness, the flavors was sweet and spicy; I could eat this all day with some rice!  Our Bulgogi beef hot bowl came with of course Bulgogi beef, bean sprouts, slivered carrots, spinach, cucumbers, and crusty rice....yeahhhh!  I love it when the rice at the bottom of the bowl  hardens giving this entree a crunchy punch.  They give you a sweet red sauce to liven up the dish since you can definitely smell and taste the strong sesame sauce oil they use to cook it.    Overall my kind of place to come to!  Seems like a family owned spot with some care and love to the craft.  In the end, it's an A in my books! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I.Love.This.Place. I have sampled a few items from the menu: a few of the Hot Stone Rice Bowls, the Bulgogi Stew, the Rice Dumpling Soup, the classic Bulgogi and some sushi. Everything has been so flavorful, and the portions are very generous. The staff there is always attentive and very friendly! Also, the kimchi is some of the best I've had. Just.go."}
{"text":"After seeing one after another's check in by fellow several yelpers, I couldn't wait to try this place. They eat good food and if they keep coming back, this place must be very solid.  Opportunity came yesterday on unusually cool morning for Phoenix in May, I was hungry for hot soft tofu soup.   When we walked in around noon, this place was busy! Only a few open tables left. As I walked by several tables I smelled yummy bibimbap sauce. I thought I wanted to eat soup but I also wanted to eat bibimbap. Before the server brought us menu, I told my friend I will order soup and you order bibimbap and let's share... Well when the menu came, my concern wasn't an issue anymore. They have combination lunch for soup and bibimbap! There must be others like me want to eat as much as I do!   Seafood soft soup bowl and hot stone bibimbap, of course it comes with several side dishes, there were lot of food. I finished everything served. Side dishes were good too. Their kimuchi was very spicy the way I like it.   I tasted my friend's spicy pork bulgogi and enjoyed nice flavor.  I saw several other dishes I wanted to try. Since my lunch was very solid authentic Korean food, I will be back to try several others in the menu.  I just need to learn to fight with food coma after eating here."}
{"text":"First time having soon tofu soup and it was great! Surprisingly filling, it was a great size. We got dumplings too, so delish but the sauce it came with didn't make sense with it. All in all, I would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"So, while the food here wasn't bad, the service, or rather lack-thereof is.   So, we were meeting with my in-laws here for dinner, and so my husband grabs the teeny, I grab the booster chair and diaper bag and we head in towards their table. All of a sudden, my foot flies out from behind me, and as I try to catch my balance, I end up smashing into a table full of hot food. (if you've had Korean food, you know that the majority of food is served scorching hot in burning hot stone bowls/dishes).  Seriously?! I'm not clumsy, and I felt so bewildered at what just happened....  Yeah, so what happened was one of the waiters had spilled something prior to our arrival and decided NOT TO CLEAN IT UP, and forgot about it. And not like a tiny little splash of water or something, it looked like a good sized dish of some dark black sauce had been upended in their entry way on their dark floor.   After the poor party whose table I had crashed into was ok, and I was ok - and felt terrible about almost falling into their food, as well as rolling my ankle while trying to catch my balance and having a minor burn/scratch on my finger (probably from contact with aforementioned stone bowl), I hurried to our table. At this point, I was pretty upset because WHO LEAVES A TON OF FOOD ON THE FLOOR at a restaurant?!?!? I usually am the one who holds our baby, too - and can you imagine what would have happened if I had been holding the baby when I slipped? Or what if it was my husband who had slipped instead of me?  I was expecting the waitstaff to be extremely apologetic for what happened. Uh, yeah no. The waiter who had spilled the sauce came up and basically said \"Oh, I'm so sorry, it was my fault. I didn't clean up the spill. You're ok?\" And that was IT.   Our actual waitress said NOTHING, didn't even check to see if I was ok. The manager? I don't know if they even have one, but no manager made an appearance. There was literally nothing done to remedy the situation, aside from the measly apology by the one waiter. If the restaurant staff had handled this situation differently, I would probably not feel so strongly as I do!  So yes, while the food was ok, my whole experience was completely ruined. On top of that, on a 50* night, all of the female waitstaff had on the shortest shorts. Seriously? Just poor taste and non-existant professionalism."}
{"text":"I got the bulgogi stone dish for $15. It was basically a bibimbap with meat. It was very big. And I mean it was very big! I thought it was pretty good the flavors were fine. It came out sizzling hot, and I broke the egg yoke and mix everything together with sauce. Tasted fantastic and it seemed very authentic. They also serve sushi but I didn't try any of that. My friends try the other dishes including the pork belly and the other bulgogi plates and some tofu soup. They didn't complain about it and it seemed they enjoyed it a lot.  The staff was friendly and was very attentive. I like how they were really familiar with their dishes and that they were constantly coming by to check if it tasted good or not. In the background they played some Korean pop music which was pleasing.   So now I have 4 Korean places that I will eat at. :-)"}
{"text":"I've only had authentic Korean food a couple of times before. I got to say, the food is excellent, the staff is nice, and the overall Korean atmosphere is pleasant topped off with soft korean music. I will definitely be coming back! :D"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this korean restaurant because of the proximity to my house but I had better.  I ordered the kimchi fried rice and i was hoping it was just as delicious as Hodoris but it isn't.  I had four spoonfuls and pushed it off to the side.  I then tried the yuk gae jang which was decent but again not as good as Hodoris or Chodang. My husband ordered Kalbi which he only ate 1/2 of it since it was extremely fatty, so  not worth $20.  We won't be returning."}
{"text":"This is my wife and I's go to Korean spot. We like the selection and service the staff provides because they're always so friendly and help us with our food choices. We've never had their sushi so I can't comment on that but their stews are always tasty."}
{"text":"Pretty good bulgogi. Kimchi is nice and spicy! Love the kimchi fried rice, will dine here again!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Come here with my coworkers every couple of months for bulgogi and to laugh at the K-Pop music videos they play. Always good. I stick to the spicy pork belly and spicy pork bulgogi. Their chicken fried rice is awesome too."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times since they've been open and each time their food never fails me, but customer service does! I haven't been here in about 6 months now and decided to come in for lunch with my aunt. While pulling up they had a \"Now Open\" sign.. haven't they been open for almost 2 years now? Am I miss something? As I walk up to the door they have a pretty tacky poster board that says \"We're open everyday\" that's awesome, when did they change that because I remember coming here several times and they were closed. I finally walk in and there's a sign that says please wait to be seated, so I'm standing there patiently waiting with my infant, staring at the server who's in the back who doesn't even notice me til I literally walk towards the back of their restaurant to go to their bathroom, which was weird and filthy, there's a random table and like some lawn mower looking thing under the table, I think that might be a hazard..  So while talking to our server, I guess they changed owners a few months ago, hopefully their customer service is better than the last and the food stays the same.  Our food comes out, everything is pretty delicious, then they began to get incredibly busy, we needed our check and a few boxes, we literally sat there while watching our server, the only server there handle 14 tables by himself, I felt bad for the kid.. But at the same time we needed our check and some boxes.. it literally took us 20 minutes to even get acknowledged, and we gave him the bill and he sat it down with some lady, randomly at the counter top, where it sat for another 15 minutes until my aunt went up there and asked the lady to run her card. The lady ran the card but charged us too much, we brought it to her attention, she didn't do anything about it and it took forever, so we didn't want to wait again, so we just told her the tip is what she over charged us with and threw in an extra 2 dollars on top of it.. Not sure if our server got the tip out of it, but I have a feeling he'd have a pretty crappy tip day anyways, all of the surrounding tables were complaining and wanting to leave too. I felt bad for him, but they need to manage their restaurant better and give this poor kid a helping hand.. hire some more help and get more organized,  or you guys will lose alot of business!   P.s. Food was still great though!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The hot stone rice is HUGE and so delish.  My new fav Korean place in town."}
{"text":"I was looking for Korean food and wanted to try something other than Chodang and Hodori.  Accidentally stumbled upon this place on yelp and am so happy I did! It's a little farther from my house, but worth the drive.  We had the galbi and seafood soon dubu combo, and the ox knee soup. The seafood in the soon dubu was plentiful and the galbi portion was also very filling. My ox knee soup was a lot larger than I expected, so I didn't have a chance to finish, and it also came with a generous portion of knee cartilage and the sweet/tangy dipping sauce that comes with it. Overall, the quality of the food was great and service was good. Definitely going to be coming back here to try more items off their menu."}
{"text":"I love Korean food, from the entrees to the side dishes. I found Gogi to be average. There weren't a lot of flavors in the bulgogi and kalbi. I found more black pepper than spices in their food, especially the fish cake. They only gave 4 side dishes! Most places I go to have at least 5-6 side dishes. They were out of brown rice too. Won't care to come back unless I'm in the area and really craving for Korean food."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and the food was awesome. The galbi was my favorite. The service was excellent and everyone was so nice to us. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The hot stone bowl is the best!  And it is really big so plan on bring home leftovers.  Only gave four stars because the service is a little slow.  We have been several times and plan on going back for sure."}
{"text":"BEWARE! AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE A PLAGUE!!!! This is my new review of this place. I have this place in my list of decent Korean food restaurants, but my most recent experience was a nightmare.  Yesterday afternoon, at 3:30, I called in for a takeout order. I asked for two orders of pork rib soup. The person who took my order said they will be ready in 30 minutes and I told them I will be there within the next hour. After one hour and ten minutes, at 4:40, I was there only to hear my orders are not ready yet. They told me to wait for 15 more minites so I did. While I was waiting, I paid for my food but no one offered me a water or anything. After ten minutes of waiting, a guy comes out and says they would refund my money because they can't work on my orders right now. I was given two extra dollars for calling one hour ahead and waiting for an hour and thirty minutes and going home with nothing. My friend who ordered the same food with me was so upset she had to call them to ask what happened. The person who picked up the phone says their refrigerator broke down the day before and all their meat and raw items have gone bad so they couldnt make my orders(?????!!!???!?!?WTH??!). My friend said if they had known they wouldnt be able to complete our orders they should have informed us when we called. My friend couldn't be more upset because of the waitress's attitude. She was giggling the whole time (im guessing because she was talking to someone else?) and when my friend asked her what is so funny in this situation she said \"so what do you want me to do about it? (WORD FOR WORD)\" Needless to say, we didn't have anything to eat and we are NEVER coming back to this place. They could have given us a list of what they could make at the time without pork or something but they didn't. Not only have they lost my business, I am never going to make a recommendation when it comes to this place."}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere, delicious Korean food, served quickly to your table and at a great price!! We went on a busy Friday, and they were friendly, found a place for us, and helped us pick some good dishes as we hadn't been there before. A great place for those who love Korean food"}
{"text":"Good Korean Food, ordered the kimchi pancake, beef and pork bulgogi. The restaurant also offers sushi.  The customer service is excellent and the food and above average. It's not a traditional Korean BBQ nor do they serve the bulgogi with the traditional sides such as the lettuce, Garlic,jalape√±o but the food is still good.  I have been here multiple times and would recommend coming here is your in the mood for Korean food."}
{"text":"Good food,clean place and great service! The side dishes r good and the plating is really pretty too. Waiters are funny and friendly which really makes a dinner pleasant:) whenever I crave Korean food, this is where I head to!"}
{"text":"Wow..this is REALLY good korean food.  As in, we've been making this a weekly habit.  They have great combos so you can get a BBQ meat with your spicy tofu soup.  I also really like their side dishes...I mean, they have Korean pickles...you don't get that at any Korean place..that's mom and pop stuff."}
{"text":"Went here with my family, and I have to say it was pretty good.  It was probably the service, since they forgot about our ban chans, not enough silverware, and we were missing a few bowls of rice.  I would recommend the bulgogi, since the meat was tender.  The spicy squid was okay, I felt like it was missing its authentic taste.  It was probably the inattentive service we received, that's why i'm giving it a 3. I would probably return here again to give it another try."}
{"text":"The place was clean and can handle larger parties.  The services was great.  The pork and chive dumplings were good.  We got many of the steamed eggs on the house.  It was good too!  We had the Korean Style omlet, that was good too!  I ordered the chicken bulgogi was OK.  It was not tasty as the beef bulgogi."}
{"text":"I came here and had a fried calamari appetizer, gal I, and beef tofu soup. The fried calamari was good, I'd give it a 4 star. The galbi on the other was pretty unsatisfying because the meat was so fatty! Every bite I took was like a piece of fat which made me feel like I'm going to get a heart attack. The tofu soup itself was a 3..it's more on the sweeter side then I would like and the beef was very chewy."}
{"text":"Excellent Korean food ! I highly recommend the beef bulgogi rice hot stone dish ! Also the seafood tofu soup is very good !! ( I order mine medium hot)  Great food, service and food is fresh and some of the best I've had. Oh yeah.....the fish cake appetizers and kimchi are quite tasty ! The potato apps are not great though"}
{"text":"Yum! This was my first time at a Korean restaurant, and it was so good! Although not the nicest ambiance, inside is really clean! We had the seafood pancake to start, which was delicious. I had a hot stone bowl, which was also delicious and a TON of food! I had lunch the next day too. The friends I went with had the Korean bbq, which they said was delicious. Overall a really great experience, and I will definitely be back soon to try some of their other dishes - can't wait!"}
{"text":"ERMAHGERD! Me and my family always go here, very lively and full of energy and excitement, great atmosphere, awesome food!"}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy pork neck with potato soup. Omg it is soooooooooo terrible! I can't imagine how  could the soup so nasty. I'm vomited when I taste the soup. I'll never come back again!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have only been there once and would like go to there again seeing that I did not have a bad experience at all. My statement is that GOGI's pretty average. The food tastes good but it doesn't give you the \"wow\" factor that you're looking for in a 4-star review.  I went with my family started with two appetizers, Korean omelet and seafood pancake. I've never had a Korean style omelet before and I wouldn't say it's my favorite dish (at least at GOGI). It was very satly and there was too much fish sauce. The texture of the egg was really good though. The seafood pancake is usually my staple appetizer every time I go try a new Korean restaurant and at GOGI the pancake came out to be average. The flour mix is a bit heavy and about 60% of the pancake was full of long green onions. Judging by the pictures on Yelp, maybe I was unlucky and their mix on that day had too much green onion. At least the flavor was good and the pancake was crispy, though. The awesome thing about the pancake is the abundance of \"seafood\". Almost every bite had a piece of tasty squid!  I then ordered the soon tofu combo: hot stone bibimbap (my staple entree) and pork soup with white base (non-spicy). It was pretty good; the bibimbap taste like what it should be with very crispy edges. The amount of flavor and saltiness was good. I usually don't order soon tofu's so I'm not expert, but the soup was okay. The pork pieces were a bit hard and dry but the base was very clean and tasty.   I would love to return to GOGI to try out different dishes so I can re-adjust my reviews accordingly. As a first-timer experience, GOGI did not turn me away."}
{"text":"Tried a new place that recently opened up and being adventuresome we tried Korean food. Place is clean,  nicely decorated.  Service was alright, nobody really checked on us which sucks but they are busy and mostly Asian people :)    We ordered Bulgogi which is a sweet Korean BBQ rib eye, very tasty. The shrimp fried rice was very good, it comes with a sunny side egg which was a lil weird but was good, and these two things together are plenty to share.  They also served small side plates with cabbage, tofu, spinach,  bean sprouts and one other thing.   We also got a philidephia roll which was excellent,  quite a big larger then other places and the st uff with more salmon and cream cheese.    All in all, place was pretty good however their soda is canned and tasted like a soda that had been in the sun.  They Defintely need soda on a gun. We will be back :)"}
{"text":"Just had our lunch at Gogi and so disgusted with the service provided.My water had a big floating on it ,yikes! And when I pointed it to the server she did not even blink an eye to it .instead changed the water without even apologizing.No one to even ask if we would like to have some sides dishes or if we need any refills.The staff was rude and this one star goes to Gogi for the food.Never will again visit this place.There are far better korean places to eat where we can enjoy the food and the service.Worst possible service ever witnessed on our special day! Save your money and spend it somewhere else."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a great place with yummy food and the waitress is very nice. YUMMY IN MY TUMMY!!!! The food is pretty good but the kim chi is the yummiest ...My favorite food is the pork.The waitress constantly check on us and ask if we need anything. REALLY GOOD. I didnt expect it  to be like that nice .Keep up with your good job. NICE WORK I am going to give you 5 stars. !!!!!! A a kid"}
{"text":"The hot rice bowl with bulgogi was delicious.  There was a lot of meat and the rice and veggies had good flavor."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for a long time because the food really is good even if the service was always mediocre.. but WOW- I'm actually shaking as I'm writing this. I have never felt so disrespected as a loyal customer until my experience tonight. First, we were seated before two other families, however those two families got menus and water before us. We kept having to \"flag\" our servers down to help us with anything we needed. When we politely asked if we could order since we usually get the same thing, our server seemed hesitant to put our order in. We asked for our plates (so we could actually eat) and the server rudely tossed it on the side of our table and rushed to go help another table. I was appalled!!! We were checked on ONCE. Finally we just asked for our check and a to go box because we about had it with the service (and also how hot it was in there) I told my husband to just wait in the car with our kids. 5 minutes go by.. then 10.. I kept raising my hand to flag a server down and all THREE of them ignored me, even the owner was right next to me by the bar and didn't say anything. Finally I just got up and got my own to go box and plastic behind the bar. On my way back to the table I still kept trying to get a servers attention for my check that I had asked for 20 minutes ago. STILL NOTHING. Finally, I'm able to catch the attention of one of them but guess what!!! The owner also grabs her attention to tell her to go to the table behind me because they needed a to go box. WOW. Just wow. I'm home now but I'm honestly still shaking. I finally get my check, no apology, nothing. I will not be returning here. I'd rather take my business to Gen where they treat all their customers equal."}
{"text":"The service is always friendly & prompt. I would 100% recommend the sweet pork belly, BEST SWEET PORK BELLY in town. Sides are yummy too, I could eat here everyday."}
{"text":"This place is great! We went on a Saturday night and got there just before the rush. The service is excellent. They are greeting everyone as you walk in and there were multiple wait staff checking on us. Appetizers/condiments came out before the main course, everything was tasty. Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"I went to Gogi for lunch special and I wrote a review blog post about my experience. Check it out! :)   http://itsmesteph.com/gogi-korean-restaurant-chandler-az/"}
{"text":"I thought all was lost when I moved out of ktown in LA to the little hot desert of Phoenix. Where was I going to get my Korean friend chicken? Korean pizza? The cheesy corn??? Well you might not be able to get all those here, but all is not lost.  I had a lot of reservations coming here, but it was a birthday dinner and I hadn't had Korean food in a while and was having major cravings. At first, I was a bit miffed by the prices, but all that soon melted away. We ordered family style with the pork belly, hot stone bulgogi bibimbap and budae jjigae (army style hot pot). The portions here are gigantic! The bibimbap is definitely made for at least 2 maybe 3 people, and the soup is made for more like 4-6. The food was also very good. Good level of spicy and weren't stingy on the sauces. Ban chan was also decent, although I thought the Kim chi was ok. Food got an A for tasty, and very reasonable prices...plus complimentary fresh fruit dessert!  I also enjoyed some drinks like makgeolli (banana is surprisingly a very delicious flavor recommended by our server) and hite. I was hoping for baekseju but alas, there was none. Service was excellent - very thorough, attentive and friendly.  Overall, a pretty solid place for Korean food and drinks in the Phoenix area with very reasonable prices. Menu isn't as expansive as I'd like but I'll definitely be returning and exploring more of the menu.  And I'm glad I've found an excellent place to satisfy my Korean food cravings. Oh and did I mention they play kpop too??"}
{"text":"This is the first Korean restaurant I have been to. The place was clean and the service was quick.   We loved the different pickles and kimchi they served as a complimentary. We ordered the spicy chicken bulgogi and mushroom soup. The chicken bulgogi was really good but lacked the spice, I liked the flavors though. mushroom soup was pretty decent, mushroom was cooked to perfection and just melted in the mouth. I would definitely want to try other dishes.  The price is definitely a little on higher side considering the competent restaurant around it. But, would definitely recommend it for all food lovers."}
{"text":"Was impressed overall with Gogi! Clean open inviting interior. Service was prompt. This place service authentic Korean food at a good price. Ordered kalbi and soon dubu combo. Kalbi was grilled perfectly with the right amount of flavor. Banchan was also good! This is probably the best Korean restaurant in AZ. Will return when I am in town again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have dined here three times, and every visit seems better than the last. The cooked food is outstanding (try the tuna steak), and the sushi is equally impeccable and innovative. You must experience both the Korean and the Japanese sides. The icing on the cake is the top-notch service -- we've had a different server every time, and they are all incredibly friendly and sweet and fast and detailed, yet they make it look effortless. When we decide to go to GOGI, we know we're going to have a really fun night. Best Asian in Chandler, hands down!  It's a great date place, as well as what appears to be a very fun birthday or special occasion/large party event. We've sat near several long tables of special occasion groups, and they seem to be having a fantastic time.  The decor is minimalist and elegant. It reminds me of restaurants in New York. I can't say enough great things about this place, hurry up and try it!"}
{"text":"Huge portions, great food.  I love their special of a medley of seafood on a hot stone. It is a little more on the pricey side but what korean restaurant isn't unless you go to LA Koreatown.  Probably one of the best Korean places in the Valley. I actually like these guys better than Hoodori and I lived 5 minutes from Mesa.   Anywho, great place to take people to dinner."}
{"text":"Went to Gogi for lunch. I ordered the classic bulgogi bibimbap while my s/o had the spicy pork bibimbap.  Food: The little appetizer-like dishes (5 total) that come with the food had a nice variety in terms of spicy vs mild. The pickled cucumbers were my favorite. The bibimbaps had a higher topping to rice ratio than I'm used to, but the variety of veggies were fun and I really enjoyed it.The spicy pork didn't seem spicy in the slightest, but that could be because I doused my own food in gochujang.  Service: fast, with regular check-ins from our waitress. She was on top of things, without being stifling or making us feel pressured to leave  Other: in the same strip mall as a great international grocery store, lots of parking"}
{"text":"My family and I were trying to find a sushi restaurant around this area...but we couldn't find it. So we decided to try this place out because we all love Korean food anyways, and so glad we did!  The food is great, can't go wrong with Korean food. We ordered a seafood pancake, two hot stone bowls, a galbi and tofu soup combo, and a tempura udon.  The food was good and we were so stuffed...had way too much food for two people. I could of shared that hot stone bowl with someone. But, that also means korean food again for lunch the next day :)  The side dishes were super delicious. Loved the steamed egg in a bowl, the spinach, and the bean sprouts!! Those are always my favorite. I asked for so many refills of those..I felt bad. But that gets me to their service. Our waitress was so nice and attentive, and always had a smile on her face! She didn't mind at all that I kept asking for bean sprouts, and she ended up giving me a to-go box full of them!!! Ahhhhh, that made my night.   The entire time we were there, we only saw Koreans dining, or at least Asians, so I think that's a good sign that there's some legit Korean food."}
{"text":"Mmm love new korean place in the valley :) I love that they have lunch and dinner tofu soup combo! Wish other korean place offer this option as I want soup and one more dish!   I had kalbi ( good! Thicker cut meat than some other place) mixed tofu soup ( clam and mussels pretty fresh) and pork lettuce wrap! ( love their side kimuchi wish they'd cut off the cartilage better though)   Overall i like this place! Kimchi was much more flavorful than some other place, side dish amount is a lil small but that's okay they give complimentary hot egg dish !   Closer to Vegas/Cali korean place :) tofu soup wasn't deep flavor but very clean and I like that ' will try them again for other yummy stuff!   Service was awesome too :)"}
{"text":"The second Korean restaurant I've visited in Arizona, this time serving only Korean food. My mother had visited this place before and told of a bad first experience she had. After trying her leftover Bibimbap, I thought, \"it can't be that bad\" and thankfully it wasn't. The dish I tried during my first visit was the buckwheat noodles in cold soy sauce. Despite being salty (what else to expect from soy sauce), I still enjoyed it. I hope in the future that they offer a Korean dish I tried in California before, where it was acorn noodles in cold soy milk broth garnished with a tomato wedge and julienne cucumber."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best Korean restaurants you will find in the Phoenix area. You definitely should try the seafood pancake, pork belly board, buckwheat noodle salad if you are into such things. The waiters could reach out more refilling water etc. (almost every time you have to remind them), but other than that, this is a great place."}
{"text":"Great great real Korean food in the valley! I've been looking for real authentic Korean food here but I had hard time to find it just right for me. Even the location is pretty far for me still this is the best Korean restaurant!  Soon topu stew and short rib stew was even better than what I had in Korea or almost same as what I had in Korea.  If you are looking for real good Korean food, you should try here!"}
{"text":"We come here often and this place is very good. Korean foods r pretty standard and good enough to come back whenever we r tired of cooking. The most great change was having KFC in their menu. Korean Fried chikcken with different sauce and style. I have been to few place where they sell similar thing and this place is far better than other place."}
{"text":"This was an outstanding experience.  The wait staff, from hostess to Jacob, were terrific.  The food extraordinary.  The place is filled to the brim with Korean patrons which of course speaks volumes as to the authenticity of the food.  We tried tempura as an appetizer and ordered four different entrees.  Every dish was exceptional.    We LOVE Gogi's!  In the Top 5 of my favorite ethnic restaurants."}
{"text":"A friend of mine had come here a few times about 2 weeks ago and a waitress at another restaurant recommended it, so we decided it was time.  We got to the restaurant about 8 PM and was immediately seated.  The servers provided excellent customer service and were willing to provide answers about any foods we were asking/looking for.  Considering the place was basically full, our food arrived in no time at all.  We tried several dishes that were good.  Everything was seasoned well and I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"My favorite Korean food in Phoenix!!! We have tried almost everything - love their bulgogi, soon tofu (esp the seafood one), galbi, haemul pajeon (seafood pancake), buckwheat noodles, and all the different bibimbaps! :-)"}
{"text":"Outstanding service and food! Go for the hot stone pots. Be careful not to get distracted and burn yourself - pots are scorching hot if you're not paying attention while basking in the glory and excitement of your yummy dish. Waiters are beyond friendly, making it an overall extraordinary experience. Can't wait to go back again!!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Just another subpar Korean restaurant that tries but fails to offer standard Korean food. Make sure to ask friends what tastes good for sure or you will be constantly disappointed. Great service when we went however, it's just the cooking that needs improvement. Too expensive for the quality, but that's every Korean restaurant in phoenix."}
{"text":"I liked this restaurant a lot.  The bulgogi is pretty good (though not the best I've had).  The galbi was great.  It's a little expensive, which is the only reason I hold back from giving Gogi 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices, nice staff. The portions are pretty large, so we often have left overs for each of us. The side dishes are unique and delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here after passing by the place a few times. Ordered the spicy bulgogi and it wasn't at all spicy, not even a little bit. The portion was not as big as other Korean restaurants I've been to. They serve you a small one person size bowl of rice with the entree and charge extra if you want more. Other places give you a huge this of white rice. This was my first and last time here since they really are stingy with their food."}
{"text":"Great new Korean restaurant in the East Valley.  Went here for the first time with some foodie friends last night.  Nice clean atmosphere with the usual Korean and Sushi menu.  We wanted to try just the Korean dishes so we could compare.  1. Korean Omelet Appetizer: If you like egg dishes then this is a must try.  Cooked perfectly (little wet - the way I like it) and flavor was fresh and was seasoned just right.  2. Fresh Water Eel Hot Stone Rice Bowl: Generous portion of one of my favorite dishes.  Rice and vegetables were perfectly balance and the sauce was superb.  The sunny side egg and eel on top was great.  Stir together with your preferred qty of sauce at the table and you will not be disappointed.  3. Galbi: great flavoring and cut.  Only complaint was I wished there was more.  4. Spicy Beef Stew:  Good balance of hotness and flavor.    My favorite part of our visit was the service.  The three girls that took our order and served our table were all extremely friendly and sincerely wanted to make our dinner memorable and enjoyable.  Our water glasses were never empty and the sides and rice were always continually offered.  Even one of our friends arrived late at closing time and they made him feel welcomed and brought him plenty rice and sides as he joined us.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was one of those moments when you're craving for KBBQ and you go on your handy dandy yelp instead of going to your favorite Korean spots in the valley.  Gogi popped up on my search and since I had been wanting to try this place out for so long we just decided to come here.   First of all, unlike other kbbq places we were seated right away and service was great! Unfortunately the flavor of their food didn't catch me. The Bulgogi we ordered wasn't piping hot and Galbi was tougher than usual. My son ordered shrimp fried rice which he loved along with the fish cake banchan. Despite the lack of flavors, I'd come back to try other food on the menu like Soon Tofu and bibimbap because it seems to have the rave reviews."}
{"text":"Good Korean food and the portions are huge. It is a little pricey but you do get what you pay for. It was very busy when I went and I waited at least 30mins for my food. I didn't mind waiting since the service I got was decent and the waiter did come up to me to apologize for the wait and kept updates on the food. He also offered more side dishes for me to try while waiting so I didn't mind since they were basically free appetizers to me. They have quite a selection for both lunch and dinner on the menu. Lunch prices are MUCH cheaper than dinner, but I'm unsure about the portion size for lunch as I only went for dinner time. They also have sushi on the menu.   One problem for me was the design of this place. I don't understand it. It's a little bit weirdly designed and off vibe for me. I don't feel cozy or comfortable sitting in the restaurant. It's just an off interior design for me. Another problem is that they don't have pictures on the menu to show the food. I like pictures on my menu so I know what I'm ordering, especially when I'm with someone who isn't use to eating cultured food. Other than that, the food is pretty bomb."}
{"text":"This place isn't a AYCE Gogi spot, please don't be confused. However, I think they've got great food over all. A wide selection of different dishes to choose from. I've tried 6-7 dishes and why've all been good so far.   If you're going for soju with friends, their boodae jjigae is good for 3-4 peeps, generous portions!"}
{"text":"Best Korean food I've ever had! We had the bulgogi hot stone, tuna nigiri and the vegas roll. Everything was amazing and I highly recommend if you're in the mood for Korean/sushi!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. The food is excellent! If you want good Korean food this is the place to go. The main reason for 4 stars, is that the service is a bit lacking, they are understaffed. When I go, they are usually fairly busy and it's hard for the wait staff to keep up, but if you don't mind waiting a bit longer for waters, sides, etc then it's not a big deal. I always still tip on the high side because I feel bad for the wait staff. It's not really their fault management under staffs the place.  In terms of the food, I've gotten their hot-stone rice bowls, soon tofu soups, as well as their main entrees. Those are the three main categories I would say they have on their menu. They also do offer fried rice, which I have not had and can't comment on.  The hot-stone rice bowls are always excellent, it's a large amount of food and if you get it with the soon tofu combo you will have enough food to take home! It's a generous portion and the soup is always excellent. I highly recommend this combo for any first timers to get a taste of authentic Korean. It will run between $13-18 dollars for this combo depending on what you get and if it's lunch/dinner.  The entrees in my opinion are on the more expensive side. While it's a good amount of meat (and it's mostly meat) I don't feel it is $16 worth of meat. Other than the price, it is very good and is the go to place for my Korean friends and I. A single entree will feed about one or two people depending on how hungry you are. Also, the mini-side dishes always help and the unlimited refills on those make this place awesome. I highly recommend this place and go here quire regularly myself."}
{"text":"I feel bad giving this place such a low rating because I really wanted to like it, but I have to give an honest review.  We ordered the lunch Bulgogi and some beef ramen soup thing (I can't remember the actual name). The lunch portion of the Bulgogi had good flavor, but the portion was way smaller than I expected. The real issue was the beef ramen noodle soup thing. It smelled rotten and tasted like something in it was old. The best description of smell I could give when the waitress asked why I wasn't eating it or wanting to take it home was \"it smells old. Sort of like a dirty sock soaked in water\".   Food: 2 out of 10 (awful) Price: 8 out of 10 (good pricing) Service: 5 out of 10 (meh)  My reason for the iffy service rating is because our waitress kept pestering us to order even though we made it clear we needed some time to decide. Besides that, she was nice and brought us everything quickly."}
{"text":"Felt the menu was limited but the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place for Korean food. Everything they make is good! I especially like their spicy pork-gogi... haha! Service is helpful and very friendly. Their stone pot bibimbap is really hot - makes that crusty rice on the bottom like it's supposed to. Be ready to flag folks down when you need something - just be cool about it... and you'll get what you need."}
{"text":"1st visit on 2 Oct 15.  My daughter and I stopped in for a quick bite.  Sat at the Sushi bar.  Had a Cali Roll, Avocado Roll, and Fresh Water Eel.  The seaweed wrapper was chewy to the point of frustration to eat it, which marred the entire sushi experience.  All the rolls were average taste-wise.  The Unagi was served cold. The waitress never asked if we wanted drinks other than the water we initially received.   All around a negative experience, and I doubt that I will return."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, convenient location, very friendly staff. Awesome little dishes which they even offer to refill! I had the beef with glass noodle dish and it was awesome. As good as if not better than those in the SF Bay Area."}
{"text":"Had dinner here Saturday night and we are taking my family back today. Delicious! My husband spent two years in Korea and said this was the most authentic meal he has had in the states. The kimchi fried rice is AMAZING!! Anyone wanting to try Korean food should definitely stop here!"}
{"text":"We ate there today and the service was the woratbi ever see at a Korean restaurant. The Asian waiters excuse they were short a server. We asked for a refill of the side dishes and the Asian waitress never came back to service us. To all you foodies I Do not recommend this restaurant. The Sashimi was horrible at $ 19.99 and the Bulgogi was okay nothing to jump up and down. Out here on Yelp you find a couple more Korean food restaurants with awesome service and better authentic tasting Korean food with the taste from Korea. I will let all my ass Hayes k ow not to eat here Thank you."}
{"text":"We were a party of 4 when we arrived for dinner. Though it was dinner time and they were crowded we we're seated immediately.  Several of our party made the mistake of ordering appetizers?. Having eaten there before, I knew the size of the portions and did not order one. All of the appetizers were tasted but were taken home.  Next we ordered main courses. While others chose to order familiar dishes, I had the Bibimbap. In due course, I was brought a very large stone bowl that radiated heat like a burner. I have eaten this dish in many places and this was the best. The rice on the bottom was appropriately crisp, and the flavors were excellent.   Our only problem was slow service. Probably due to the large crowd, however, since we were seated next to the serving counter we helped ourselves to whatever we needed.  Bathrooms were appropriately clean and stocked and the floors and tables in the restaurant we're clean.   With the exception of the slow service I give them 4 stars for excellent food, large portion size, and general cleanliness."}
{"text":"I love Korean food so I can't really say anything bad.  This place was busy when we got there, so it was lucky for us we made reservations.  Didn't wait long initially for our server to come by and take our drink orders but it did take a while to come back with it.  We decided the normal stuff, seafood pancake, kalbi, bulgogi, chap chae, and chicken katsu for the kids.  They have the normal side dishes like other places so that is cool.  Nothing really stands out but like I said, I love Korean food.  I really judge Korean restaurants by its chap chae, and this place had pretty good chap chae.  Large servings didn't hurt either.  Prices are normal when it comes to Korean food.  I feel that it is pricey, but I guess you get what you pay for.  I will probably be back when I have that craving."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, the food and service is always spot on. It has become our go to place for Korean food, we tried other places and have always been disappointed when comparing to Gogi."}
{"text":"The hot stone bowls are a behemoth of a meal, and so very tasty! You get your choice of meat/veggie/tofu, and the bowl is loaded with rice, veggies, and aforementioned protein. Since it is served in the hot stone, the rice on the bottom caramelizes and has a nice crispy texture.  We shared a lot of different dishes on our visit here. In addition to the hot stone bowl, we got the omelet appetizer, buckwheat noodle with sashimi, beef bulgolgi, and tofu salad. The omelet appetizer was a large roll of egg and veggies, good but nothing too special. The buckwheat noodle was served cold, in a more al dente texture, covered with spicy red sauce. While I enjoyed the noodles, a sashimi piece I ate had some cartilage or gristle on it, and the dish was so overwhelmingly covered with sauce that it tended to overpower the rest of the ingredients.  The beef bulgolgi was good, but it seemed like a smaller portion that what I'm used to (Or maybe it looked small due to the huge size of the hot stone bowl). The tofu salad was excellent. It had a delicate taste from the silky firm tofu slices, drizzled with a tangy, lightly sweet dressing, with fresh greens.  Service was excellent and the waitress was very cheerful and friendly."}
{"text":"I like the hot plate bibimbap with bulgogi. Also had the steamed egg (fluffy egg souffl√©) and the spicy pork with kimchi and tofu. The sauce that they bring out with the bibimbap is tasty. We went on a sunday evening and the service was good. They kept an eye out for empty side dish plates and replaced them with new ones. They asked us how was everything during the meal. And they gave us boxes and a bag at the end of the meal. I can't complain."}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch and dinner. The menu has a great variety. The inside decor is not bad and the tv screens that play korean music videos is a nice touch from the usual blank walls.  The servers here are always nice and very accommodating. Never have I had a bad service and I've at one point gone to this place three times in one week. They do have newer servers now since they've opened but the quality has not changed.   Food is great. The best prices for lunch can be found here. I would recommend the galbi and the seafood pancake. Get the pancake extra crispuI have tried their kimchi pancake but I'm not much of a kimchi fan. Not to say it's not good it's just not my preference. The tofu soups are all great so whatever flavor you may want you won't get disappointed. The bibimbap is amazing because of the amount and the flavor. It comes out hot and continually stays hot due to the stone bowl it is in. Don't let your rice sit for too long and continue mixing as you eat or your rice will get hard and will stuck to the bottom.  Sushi here was also a great find. Pieces are huge and the prices are fair. If you like a nice cheap chirashi bowl they have two versions korean and traditional Japanese. Their Johnny rocket roll has a nice flavor but I would recommend the King Kong roll. True to it's name the pieces are huge."}
{"text":"SO BOMB.   I usually eat their KBBQ every time I come. It was until my mother invited me out with her ex co-workers she was still in touch with. We ended up being a party of 8 (if I recall correctly) and the servers always came to check on us and refilled our drinks constantly. Very good service.   Can't remember everything we ordered (I didn't order or pay) but I remember the Chop Chae being one of the most TASTIEST foods I've EVER EATEN, and trust me, I have the best home cooked meals from my mother and I go to authentic places VERY often. The other meal that came just as close was the teriyaki salmon. OMGGGGG so savory and delicious (however either the most expensive dish or the top ones).   I went again next time and ordered only Chop Chae to eat with my mother. It filled us both and we still had leftovers (around $18).   For new comers, you can refill the side dishes!  Great service (young staff) and great food. Will always come back!"}
{"text":"Let's start by saying the food was delicious. I decided to order take out and looked at the Yelp pictures and saw the menu. Ordered Kalbi and bulgogi thinking it was the $9.99 price like it shows on the menu... It's not. The guy on the phone didn't tell me the price before I hung up so I went to pick up my order and paid $47!!!! Lol honestly it's my fault for not confirming the price. The only reason for the 3 stars is based on how much I paid for only two things, the portion for to-go wasn't that big and the amount of rice they gave was sad :( I went home and made more rice in my rice cooker. but hey, the food was good! Anddd the guy who help me was really nice.   *** I see the reviews are saying the portions they got were huge but idk mine just wasn't? Maybe because I ordered Togo?"}
{"text":"Great experience from moment we walked in...great greeting by hostess. The menu is vast and choosing was get different dishes and sample. This worked great but everyone wanted hot stone dishes so it was a superb tasting event. The bulgogi and spicy pork are excellent. Intend to frequent again soon...lots of great food to try."}
{"text":"Exactly what I expect for Korean restaurant. Was told about how good their foods taste. I am satisfied with the choice.   The food are just as delicious as my photoshows. It's better to go as a group, so you can share many different dishes. The portion is huge enough for hungry people like me.  Stone Rice bowl is HUGE."}
{"text":"Cute little Korean restaurant in Chandler. Service was quick, and the wait staff were pleasant and helpful. This establishment was very clean and not too busy over lunch. Our food was delicious, I had the spicy chicken bulgogi and would definitely get it again. Our food was out within 10 minutes of ordering and was hot. The prices were a little high for the serving sizes, but overall great place to grab a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"This is my fav Korean spot in town. They're closed on Mondays so it's hard to get a chance to stop in. My favorite is their hot stone bibimbap soon tofu combo. It's nicely air conditioned with plenty of tables. It seats big parties which is great cus we have family that always comes into town."}
{"text":"Second time here for lunch and I'm still a fan. I would be here more if I lived closer because I love their Hot-Stone Rice dishes (includes vegetables, red pepper paste). I ordered my favorite version, the Fresh Water Eel. I Also tried a new dish the Spicy Pork Belly (grilled pork belly marinated with korean chili). Both were very good.  Service both times has been good, I also arrive earlier to hit it before the lunch crowd comes in. Good food, good service, good lunch."}
{"text":"I will preface this review by saying their food was delicious but the way they do business is very shady and quite frankly unethical. This place does not do itemized receipts, which is understandable as I know many other restaurants do this as well but they still do not indicate tax and gratuity. As a matter of fact they include gratuity at 18% automatically into the bill which is understandable as well. What upset me though was upon receiving my bill it seemed quite inflated EVEN when accounting for the 18% tip and tax. Then through further investigation I found that I was charged 10% more on the original cost of the food without any seemingly explanation. I indicted the correct amount on the signed merchant receipt but when I got home they still charged me the original amount different than what I had written down which I am pretty sure is illegal. Safe to say I will not be eating from this lying, cheating institution ever again."}
{"text":"We had a party of twelve and Kristen handled our meal and took care of us with a contagious smile and gracious attitude.  The food was delicious and timely with generous portions!  Everyone in our party raved about the whole experience.  I can't thank Kristen enough for keeping up with us constantly changing seats to catch up since most of us hadn't seen each other in a few months.  I had the beef tartare hot stone rice bowl (bibimbap) and I can't believe I ate the whole thing!  Can't wait to go back, which is more than I can say for Gelato 64, two doors down."}
{"text":"I went few days ago. The services still awesome! They always checked on us and asked how was the food! OMG, the banchan was bomb! We end up asked like 2 times..lol...Definitely will go back! We ordered galbi and ugh i forgot but overall awesome! Definitely will go back to try pork belly!"}
{"text":"First and also the last time here. Came in, got seated and handed the menu, but after that no one seems to give a sh** about us anymore even though waved twice. Even the group came after us got their drinks and ordered when we still have NOTHING. Eventually left after the frustration."}
{"text":"I didn't read the reviews beforehand - just from the pics alone I knew I had to try this place! I hadn't had much Korean beyond some bulgogi and the typical ban chan, so I was excited to try something new!  My group of four went on a Thursday evening, 7pm. It was rather quiet, only two or three small parties. The service was great! The waitresses were attentive and sweet, without hovering, and the food came quickly.  The food was DELICIOUS! I appreciated the pictures from Yelp, as the menu didn't have any. That'd be my only suggestion for GOGI, to design a new menu with pics for the inexperienced or those who pick by what visually speaks to them in the moment.  My man and I shared the hot stone bibimbap and seafood soon tofu. Loved the mix between the crispy rice at the bottom and the runny, savory yolk of the fried egg. The flavor of the soon tofu was rich and spicy without too much heat, and was balanced wonderfully by the soft tofu that gave it a velvety texture. $16, and there was plenty of food for two!  By the time we left, around 9, the place was getting busy! We're already planning the next visit!"}
{"text":"Soooo... I honestly had no expectations for this place... It's in heavily Chinese-centric strip mall where lee lee market is located. There is a tattoo parlor right next door should you decide to commemorate your GOGI experience. Such and eclectic mix of businesses...   Anyhow. I walked in on a wed lunch break and waited awkwardly at the front to be seated for a couple minutes. Once I got seated, things moved fairly fast. I couldn't decide between the bibimbap or the hot soondooboo, so I determined I'd get the combo which had both. Win win. Yay.  I liked their banchan and I loved loved loved their bibimbap. I got the mixed soondooboo spicy, where I found the meat in the soup to be actually very delightful whereas some places give you the trash meat in the soup. Kudos. Job well done GOGI.  Now. On to the stone dol-sot-bibimbap. WOWZER. The thing was bigger than my head. It was the size of a med pizza, which I ate without guilt. Funny isn't it? I would feel so horrid if I ate the same amount in pizza but felt weirdly satisfied when I ate the equivalent in a bibimbap? It is something you MUST try. I loved it and crushed it. I challenge you ;)"}
{"text":"The Korean BBQ @ GOGI may very well be the best I've ever had in the Valley. I seriously think I could live on just their pork belly for the rest of my life.   The perfect amount of sweet, spicy, and wonderfully tasty is exactly what you get with each and every dish you order here.   Their service quick, friendly, and the staff is always happy to explain any questions with the menu or make suggestions based on individual palettes.   GOGI is one of those restaurants that when someone asks 'where should we go eat?', it's one of the first spots that comes to mind. Every. Single. Time. This place definitely sets the bar for Korean barbecue in Arizona."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Had the Galbi and spicy squid and pork belly. It was amazing. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I've had an array of things on the menu, dined in and had take out at different times of the day- always so good. Hot pots gogi and the shrimp fried rice are YUM. Even my 6 year old loves the fried rice(he's picky). It's always perfectly moist and sticky- the way it should be. Yum yum yum. I love this place. My guy had the chicken teriyaki last time we went and it was delish too. Keep it up Gogi!"}
{"text":"I just came here for the first time and I was not let down! Our waitress was the sweetest girl and the service was great! I got a refill every time my glass was halfway empty. I ordered the Hot Stone Bibimbap with Bulgogi and I must say I was impressed. That last time I had hot stone that good was in K-town in California! My meat was very tender and the side dishes were great! My sister and my friend also ordered their Soon Tofu and it was so full of flavor!   If you decide to order Bibimbap then make sure you come hungry! The portions are very large. This place definitely hits the spot and the customer service was great!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant! Great atmosphere and service. We ordered one of their sushi combos and sashimi, and it was the best we've had in the valley! The sashimi practically melted in your mouth. I definitely recommend this great new restaurant; I know I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, but the service is absolutely terrible. I've been here 3 times and every time I hope that the service will be better but it never is. Takes about 10 minutes just to order drinks and another 10 to order food unless you flag down your waiter. My friend and I both ordered the same thing and her food came out 15 min ahead of mine. My sister ordered a deep fried sushi roll and when it came out she noticed it wasn't fried at all. When she asked the waiter he stated that they changed how they cooked the roll but haven't updated the menu. We finished eating and sat for an extra 30 just waiting for the bill. Currently I'm still waiting for our bill. The couple next to us has been seating for at least 20 min and nobody has been by to ask them what they want to drink. HIRE MORE PEOPLE."}
{"text":"We came here only because my wife was in the mood for sushi and Hon Machi was closed.  Thank you, Hon Machi, for being closed, because this gave us the opportunity to try this phenomenal new restaurant now on our rotation.    Are you looking for sushi?  Gogi's got it fresh and tasty, and they'll serve you a lot! (See picture)  Teryaki?  YES, with BIG hunks of meat.  I have had Chicken Teriyaki in a lot of places, and this place seriously surprised me with how much juicy, fresh chicken they put on my plate.  Like fried calamari?  This isn't the Italian type!  No rings or small tentacle bunches--you get strips and large, whole crispy tentacles.  Not as tender as the ones I'm used to, but very delicious!  While the place is primarily Korean, there's a good deal of Japanese and even Chinese dishes here as well.  There's enough choices to make anybody happy, so go here and bring your friends or family--or both.  When a lot of the other sushi houses are closed in the afternoon until 5pm, they are open.  Don't wait or hesitate--GO to GOGI."}
{"text":"My go to place for Korean food when I crave soondubu or other awesome korean dish. The place is big so bring everyone! They have drinks too. I have had the soondubu, the rice cakes, the spicy chicken and the short ribs. Everything was tasty. Nothing fancy about this place but the food and the ban chan selection is pretty good. Around the corner grab a milk tea on your way out and you are all set!"}
{"text":"I usually get the hot stone bulgogi (bibimbap). I've had the galbi before and it was delicious. The meats are seasoned very well. Even the condiments were good. What I like about the hot stone bulgogi is that it comes with an egg and I like poking the yolk and have it drip into my rice. The hot stone is sizzling hot so be careful that you don't burn yourself because I burned my arm :/ (I was too excited for my food).   Wanted to update my review and give it a 5 star. The staff is very attentive and they're so cute. The food is so good. One of the best bibimbaps in Arizona."}
{"text":"Thought this was a sushi restaurant though I should have known better based off the name. (Gogi means meat in Korean)  Our party of three got the 3 Soondubu stews and the Bibimbap. (Friend's Pork Bulgogi never arrived but it was waived from the final check) I thoroughly enjoyed my Beef Soondubu as it was a boiling hearty bowl of goodness filled with a whole egg and tofu. I never received gochujang (spicy red pepper paste) for my bibimbap but I had fun dipping the rice into the soup so I ended up not missing it that much. Sadly I left my to-go box of the bibimbap at the nearby Boba House so I didn't really get to experience the dish in it's fullest form.  Prices here are similar to the other Korean restaurants in the area with $10-$15 prices for most dishes. Their banchan selection is average with five sides offered.  Service is a little slow as they seem to be understaffed during the lunch rush and you may be forced to flag them down with some waving to get some attention.   Overall I like this place way better then Hodori and on par with Chodang and the other  Korean restaurants in Glendale. A good addition to the Lee Lee's neighborhood and I'm sure they'll work out their consistency issues."}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review.  I've used Yelp many times but this is the first place I had to write about.  The seafood pancake was the highlight of my dinner so fresh and the vinegar jalape√±o sauce that went with it elevated the dish!  The hot skillet rice is amazing too.  I got the ribeye for the meat.  Absolutely no complaints.  I will most definitely be back.   The service was fast and efficient.  Well worth my 5 star review."}
{"text":"'Get there early it fills up.  Huge selection of Korean food.  Portions are huge so take a few people.  I've tried different items each time but kimchi rice has been a go to each time.  Tempura appetizer is very good, one time it included acorn squash which was really good.  Bulgogi is good.  There are a couple dishes available only at lunch so I'll need to try these at some point. Service is good, they are all friendly.  The hot stone rice dishes are very good, we usually get one of these and have tried a few different ones."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite Korean restaurant so far! The service is amazing and the food so fresh and delicious!! Can't get enough of it!!"}
{"text":"Service A+, decor very nice, Bul Gogi and side dishes = Phenomenal. Can't wait to go back. These guys know how to put out top quality Bul-Gogi! Super fresh rib-eye beef.  What a treat to have them open up a few months ago, truthfully the best Korean Food in Arizona, look no further, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Their food is just okay..second time coming here today and we came around 3:30 before we were about to go watch a movie.. the service here just sucks.. we were the only ones in there with one other table and it took them 10 min to  come and check on us .. they try to say its their lunch.. if u Guys are going to eat lunch during this hour then close the restaurant during this time or have more waiters or something.."}
{"text":"Best Korean in Arizona. Stop in and try it. The staff is so friendly and they make great food. I eat hear once a month."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and it never disappoints. Bulgogi and hot stone rice and sure to satisfy. The service is better than most asian restraunts and the portions are huge. I got a take out order and it still came with pickled vegetables on the side. The veggies are very tasty and their kimchi is better than most"}
{"text":"This is definitely my new favorite Korean place in Phoenix (sorry I'm never going to Hodori ever again). I went here for dinner with my boyfriend and we were able to share a pork soondubu and galbi combo, which was about $20. My boyfriend has a shellfish allergy, and the waitstaff was very helpful in ensuring that he was accommodated for. Their ban chan (sides) were really good and they made sure to offer us refills. Their soondubu was also really good, and their galbi was good but a little overcooked. I will definitely be returning here!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  This might be the best Korean restaurant in the Valley.  As with every Korean place anywhere you try ti find what's best on the menu and stick with it.  That's what my wife and I have done and our conclusions are:  No place else serves gamja tang in the Valley far as I know.  It is pretty good here.  It is big, and filling, with enough meat.  They raised the prices a bit, but it is still one of the better values for Korean food there is.  The dogani tang is also a good value.  They have put in A LOT of dogani every time I've ordered it.  The haemul pajun is solid here.  It is huge and I think they put in the most seafood of all the haemul pajuns around.   Finally, the dolsot bibim bap is also pretty good here.  I believe you get the best value here for your money of all the Korean places in the Valley.  Again, no place gets barbecued meat right in the Valley either, so when it comes to taste, I give it a meh.  BUT, they do give you a lot."}
{"text":"The staff here is wonderful, they are very welcoming and attentive. The food here is great, the seafood pancake is what we get and they definitely don't skimp out on the seafood! The bulgogi hot stone is also one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy their food. Sweet and spicy chicken, korean chirasi, hot stone bibimbap are my favorites.   I bring my family once or twice a month and they love their food too.   But at every visit we have cleanliness issue. Plates are dirty, utensils are dirty, cups are dirty.   One time, unknown string was found in my hot pot. I do ask for replacement utensil sets and plates but really tired of seeing this issue every time."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here for lunch earlier today based on a recommendation from her friend.  We ordered off the lunch menu.  I got the spicy pork bulgogi while she got the chicken bulgogi.  Both were excellent.  Plus the kimchee and other sides were great.  And a very reasonable price as the meal cost us $23 plus tip."}
{"text":"Good Korean food. I wish they would offer combos instead of everything family style. However, the food is pretty authentic. The only reason why I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because their side dishes are skimpy. They only offer 4 side dishes where many Korean restaurants I've been took have at least 6."}
{"text":"customer service is very good and food is great. It's a good place to start for non-koreans to get introduced into korean food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Korean places in town. The staples are bulgogi, soon tofu and bibimbap. They have a good soon tofu combo which is a very good deal considering the portions you get. The combo easily feeds 2-3 people."}
{"text":"Very good place. The dishes are good here so is  the price. And the service is very friendly the owner or chef even came out to check everyone's satisfaction of the food. Very impressive. Good experience here. Definitely go again."}
{"text":"I'm not GOGI there again... listen, by far this was the worse Korean restaurant I've ever eaten at, I mean, it started off with service.  I was seated and was not offered a beverage until 20 mins after arriving. To make matters even more horrific... when the side dishes arrived, what I thought was zucchini,  was the potato side dish.  That's how scary it was to eat there."}
{"text":"The service for our table of 4 was excellent. Everyone enjoyed their meals. I had the beef tartare hot stone bowl, which was out of this world delicious. It's huge, so I had plenty for lunch the next day, too."}
{"text":"Pretty average for Korean. The service is not very good it's pretty hard to get your water refill. The bulgogi was definitely dry, overcook. The spicy pork was very good.  Overall if you want Great Korean this is not it. Look to a place like Chodang."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about the good reviews here because my friend and I had very bad experience at GOGI. The food was okay but the service was totally terrible. It was on Thursday night and they weren't that busy. This was our first time here, and I will surely never come back!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place...  pretty good,  n abput same flavors as chodang... then we got the tempura combo..  wow.  one of the best tempura i have had..."}
{"text":"*Edited 12/15/2014*  -New review-  Went back for some gogi, yup. +1 star. :D  -Old review-  Any new Korean restaurant in the valley is welcome and always a good sign of the growing community!  My g/f and I got there a little later than our usual dinner time, but was glad that they were open until 10pm (which is always good). I've noticed a trend that the Korean restaurants in the west valley are generally open until 11pm or even later, while the east valley restaurants close no later than 10pm.   The first thing I noticed was the classy decor of the restaurant, but was a little perplexed of the \"no-grill in the table\". Perhaps they bring out a mini-burner like Hodori? With the restaurant named \"meat\" I would assume that is their specialty, but I will save that for another visit as I did not see any people with the burner - please keep in mind it was 9pm so I wasn't expecting the restaurant to be packed.  Anyways, I ordered the mae-un-tang (spicy fish stew) and my g/f ordered the kimchi tofu soup. The side dishes came out very quickly and we were served kimchi, radish kimchi, pickled radish slices, bean sprouts, spinach, and fish cake stir fry. The radish kimchi was a little bland for my liking but the rest were pretty good.  The tofu soup was the first dish to make it out - while it had decent flavor, it didn't really compare to some of the tofu-specialty restaurants in the valley - but that's okay, we really didn't expect \"blow my mind\" tofu soup since the restaurant's name was Gogi (meat). My spicy fish stew came out not long afterwards and was served in a traditional shallow and wide pot. Glad I ordered that - it was pretty delicious. The whitefish was nice and soft and had all of the fixings that it should have had.  Service was pretty good overall~ I'd definitely like to come back and try the meat dishes!"}
{"text":"Excellent flavors and variety of dishes. The seafood tofu soup was perfect. Great service as well!"}
{"text":"West-facing front in the northwest corner of the shopping center.  You can't see it from Lee Lee.  I was just there for the first time and got take-out, but I'm looking forward to going back and dining in because the food was great and the atmosphere was dark and quiet, which I like.  Friendly staff, and the bulgogi that I brought home with me was delicious, as were the sides.  I'll be back to dine in and try the sushi.  Long overdue update: I've been back many times to dine in, tried many menu items, and as far as I can tell you can't go wrong. All of the menu items I've tried are great, I love the atmosphere, and the service is always friendly and courteous. One of my favorite places. If I could give them another star I would."}
{"text":"I think the place is an okay place to come and have a meal whenever you're craving Korean food. The food isn't terrible, but it's not great either. The side dishes were sub par - the typical kimchi, fried fish cake, marinated potatoes, zucchini, and bean sprouts. I picked at each of them a little, but I didn't want to go any further than that.  I had the osam bulgogi (spicy squid and pork belly). It came in a huge round plate with some sad looking salad on the side. It wasn't bad. Some other people in my party ordered the regular bulgogi, which came in a smaller, more manageable portion, and it looked more appetizing as well. One person ordered the fried rice - it was so strange because it came in a huge dish, all rounded out with a fried egg on top.  The decor and color scheme were strange. A row of irrelevant paintings on one wall and the colors black and brown everywhere. The place didn't exude a Korean feel to it at all.   My overall feeling was that I just wasn't impressed with the food and confused by the decor."}
{"text":"Good food, and good service! We got the bulgogi and it was amazing! Really really tasteful meat and full of flavor. We also got the tootsie roll, which was also AMAZING! Sweet, but not too much and then a mouthful of flavor. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Went to Gogi for dinner with family and friends Place is packed Service: was still quick and attentive even if the place is packed Facility:It could use better lighting, plenty of parking  Food: was really great, our Korean friends say this is one of the place to go in the Chandler area Overall: very good experience"}
{"text":"It was huge satisfying meal..... must must come  esp during lunch time....... this is the place I wish I had discovered more sooner ...... it's totally worth ur money and taste buds.."}
{"text":"Came here last night and had a great time!  Food was definitely very good.  tried a spicy tuna roll, Korean omelette, soon tofu combos for my wife and I, one with Kalbi and the other with bibimbap .   loved the flavor on everything and a great value for a Korean restaurant here in the valley!  so glad to see an option  outside of the few that are out there.  :)  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm always excited try new Korean restaurants because Korean food is my absolute favorite!!  I stumbled into Gogi because I was on my way to Lee Lee Market to pick up some ingredients for a meal I was going to cook this weekend and had to give it a try.  I usually always order Galbi as the first meal at any Korean restaurant so I can have a baseline to compare.  It was good, the quality of the short ribs were decent, not too fatty and not much gristle.  The portion for $21 was average to other Korean restaurants. I thought it was going to be huge because my wife's Bibimbap bowl, which came out first, was enormous.  The banchan was good, nothing special.  I was happy when I asked if they had Kkakdugi and they were able to bring some out of the back!! All in all it was a solid Korean restaurant and I would gladly come back."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night. We had our usual, the bimbimbap and I had a Kirin. Great food, prices, and service. They even had a Korean band tonight. I really like the live music."}
{"text":"Soju, kalbi, bossam, oh my!  I really thought my days of associating with Koreans were over since I left San Diego for the valley, and that I would have to travel back to Cali to find decent Korean food.  I've already written of my struggles to find chaminsul soju in AZ, so I was glad to see Jinro on their shelf. I can't speak to service as I got an order to go, but the waiter who helped me was friendly which is more than you normally get in Ktown LA, so that's a plus.  The kalbi and spicy pork belly were both as good as what I have gotten in Socal, so I was extremely pleased. Their banchan was good as well.  Maybe one of these days I'll get people to join me for a soju party, but until then, the to go order I had will have to satisfy my needs till then.  Kam samida yo!"}
{"text":"Nasty soup, that I refused to eat after I tasted it, however they still charged me for it."}
{"text":"I came for the  spicy pork and it was delicious. The portions are large.   The place is clean and has fast service."}
{"text":"Just had first dinner at Gogi. Everything was very fresh and TASTY. The \"Monkey Balls\" were amazing - tuna, mozzarella, jalapeno in balls and deep fried. Maybe a little light on the jalapeno. Seaweed salad was a thing of beauty and really delicious! Husband ordered kimchi soup, which was great and I don't normally like kimchi. We'll be going back for sure. Servers were very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Gogi last night for dinner.  Both of us are familiar with Korean food, having eaten in restaurants in Seoul (Sinchon), Tennessee, Mesa, and the Las Vegas Strip, as far as Korean style food.  Bottom line we know how Korean food tastes.  My wife ordered Thick Noodle Soup (Kimchi).  She did not have a problem with the level of spice or the kimchi.  Probably the fact that the taste being strong then what we had in Seoul, South Korea is a regional difference of the chef.  The thing that really did get to her was the fact that the noodles were severely undercooked.  My wife is Asian, and knows how noodles are supposed to be in soup.  They were not al dente.  They were severely undercooked.  I ate Soon Tofu Seafood (Soondubu).  Compared to what I have eaten elsewhere in the East Valley for Korean food, and what I have eaten in Seoul, South Korea for similar, the soup's taste was totally off.  They need to learn to cook it.    We also ate one order of Maki Sushi, Spicy Tuna Roll.  Based upon what we got we barely found the sushi edible.  It was not even up to par to what we have eaten in places here in Arizona, yet alone elsewhere.    As far as the service it is slow.  It took me nearly three times over the course of 0.5 hour to get my check delivered to me at the end of the meal, and just as long for them to acknowledge that it was ready for processing.  There is absolutely no organization or division of the duties as far as who is running the place.  Also, the way they do housekeeping sucks.  They need to go study how things are done in Seoul (South Korea) at some restaurant, and they can see how to be efficient, and be clean.    As a result, my wife and I will most likely not return to Gogi for Korean food.  We will go elsewhere in The Valley for Korean food, unless we are in Seoul (and we travel often enough to South Korea).    We definitely advise this place to improve.  You can not compete with doing the status quo."}
{"text":"Arguably the best banchans,  modern decors, as well as service in this crown jewel of Korean cuisine in the heart of Asian plaza in Chandler.   Since the owners are active community members he immediately recognized me as well as my colleagues and gave us VIP treatment with extra Garumjim to thank me for support.  Their oxtail soup was do tender that melts in mouth where I had to siphon all the bone marrows because it was so heavenly delicious.   One of the largest portion of Dolsol bibimbop, soontobu, as well Kalbi truly delights us."}
{"text":"What isn't to love?  We went for a Sunday lunch with the kids and got there about 20 minutes after they opened.  There were already a couple tables full but plenty of places to sit for our party of 7.  We were promptly greeted and invited to sit down.  The waitress quickly took our drink and appetizer order, then a couple minutes later, entree orders.  The appetizers came out very quickly, along with the side dishes, and the entrees just a few minutes later.  Everything we had was AMAZING and we were offered water or refills often enough to be appreciative but not annoyed.  The waitress cheerfully brought more kimchee on request,  as well as more of the potato side dish my daughters went crazy over.  The kimchee was yummy, spicy but not crazy, wonderful flavor.  The potato side dish was delicious too, I can understand why my daughters liked it.  There were zucchini and bean sprouts too, and while the fish cake one has never been a favorite of mine, I found myself going back for more of this version.  Now to the main events:  we had the mixed seafood pancake and calamari appetizers, then beef bulgogi, spicy squid and pork belly, teriyaki chicken, and seafood tofu soup.  The pancake was so delicious and the dipping sauce just made it better.  The calamari was perfectly cooked and its dipping sauce was tasty, too.  The bulgogi was well-cooked and savory, the squid and pork belly was swimming in red pepper goodness and left me wanting more, and the seafood tofu soup was pleasantly spicy and savory and just the kind of comforting food you want in a soup.  I actually didn't get any of the teriyaki chicken but everyone who did said it was delicious and it looked like high quality, skillfully cooked chicken breast.  My husband, who spent a year in Korea, was in heaven.  I loved that the place settings were steel chopsticks and spoons, but also that a request for a fork for our youngest was graciously met.  And the most amazing part?!  All this delicious food and good service cost us about $100 including drinks and tip!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I like the fact that it is spacious & clean at sight. There were yotal 4 servers. Almost 10 minutes after seated a young server came to take drink order & we both asked for water but didn't get it for 7 minutes while she was standing looking around to check which table need yo be served. When we called for attention, one of the other server informed  us she'll be right with us in korean.  When she came to take the order, Katty asked a question in korean but the server couldn't answer nor seem to understand korean.  When we got the food, we were a little disappointed with the quality of the food. Spicy pork was previously frozen & may have been for a long time because it was dry & it has that freezer burn smell/look to it.  Chicken soup with noodles were ok but nothing compared to what the name is called for (chicken kalgooksu). Did not taste anything like kalgooksu. it almost tastes like chicken brooth with noodles & shreded chicken stips. I gave it 3 stars because it look cleaned at sight & spacious for privacy if needed."}
{"text":"I ordered spicy tofu soup to go.  They were sooo generous and included a separate BIG to-go container of their condiments like pickled vegetables, bean sprouts, etc.  I was not expecting that!  The only thing is I wish the spicy tofu soup had been spicier.  It didn't really seem that spicy at all to me.  I have eaten here before as a dine-in customer and I would definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very authentic food with extensive menu including Japanese options. My favorite is the caviar mixed rice. Also try the potato and pork rib stew. It's hard to come by anywhere else in AZ. It's quite a drive for me to come here but will make the effort  if I'm craving their food. Service is fast."}
{"text":"This place has a nice family feel to it.  Staff are friendly and food is very good.  The bulgogi, seafood pancake, spicy pork, kim chee fried rice, bimbambap are all very good with generous portions."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today, feasted like a beast, and I was pretty much rolled out... towards a few doors away for some gelato as dessert.  Don't judge me.  After escaping the near 100-degrees that makes up an Arizona April day, we were promptly sat down in an intimate booth.  The atmosphere was very simplistic and classy.  We were given a menu for Korean and a sushi list on the side.  After observing an impressive selection, we ordered tako su, soft shell crab, and two stone rice bowls [fresh water eel and caviar].  Had I known my lunch date wanted a stone bowl, I would've chosen something else so we can try more items.  Don't you hate it when that happens?  The tako su appetizer consisted of five piece of steamed octopus tentacles dressed in lots of Japanese vinegar.  It was a pretty toothsome little piece of octopus and wasn't anything spectacular. I don't really recommend it.  Soft shell crab appetizer was pretty standard.  It's not exactly San Francisco where they fry the whole blue crab with legs and all.  I'm sure the legs were used for spider rolls so you really just get the body of the crab.  Once again, nothing spectacular and wouldn't order it again.  The hot stone rice bowls though, that's love.  They actually serve it in the stone rice bowls!  A lot of places around the valley gets away with serving their rice bowls in metal bowls but this place has your rice, veggies, goodies, and egg on the stone bowl.  It was sizzling and crackling for a long while.  This thing is hot!  For $16, I would come back for the rice bowl alone.  Note:  the advertised caviar was really just smelt roe they use in sushi.    Overall I had a great and filling lunch.  Service was fast and friendly, food was decent, and I will totally be back to try their actual lunches.  Our total bill was $52.  Not bad for two appetizers and two entrees!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit here.  I had the spicy squid for lunch. The food was excellent, portions were large, The service was prompt. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to Gogi several times, and I really like the food. The hot rice plate with bulgogi is fantastic. The dinner comes with five bochun, which is less than I get elsewhere, but the entrees are so good I don't care.  The service is friendly and the restaurant is clean. There is not much ambiance, but it is all about the food here."}
{"text":"We've eaten here over dozen times and we've never disappointed with food quality or service. Coming from southern Cali where we have many Korean restaurants to choose from...this place ranks in the top 5.  Portions are plentiful, banchan sides are on point and bulgogi is out of this world."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend on a Tuesday afternoon to beat the Arizona heat of 116 degrees! We were craving mool nengmyun, so we came here for dinner. Mool nengmyun is a cold noodle dish with icy/slushy beef broth, buckwheat noodles, and topped with brisket slices, a boiled egg, pickled raddish and some other toppings. It's the perfect thing to eat on a hot and summer day. The restaurant wasn't busy when we got there and we were seated right away. When we ordered the server said they were out of it and we were so bummed and started looking for other restaurants that had nengmyun. The only other Korean restaurants that have mool nengmyun is Chodang (which is closed on Tuesdays), and Hodori, which is in Mesa and their nengmyun is ok, but they don't give you any meat in the dish and the portion size is smaller for the same price. A short while later the server came back and said that the kitchen actually has the broth and we were able to order it. I'm glad to know that they actually make their broth rather than use pre-made powder or store bought stuff. The mool nengmyun here is really good, great portion size, the buckwheat noodles are soft and chewy. Other restaurants tend to not cook the noodles long enough so it's a little harder and more chewier. The sliced meat was soft and tender and the broth was really refreshing. A lot of restaurants serve the broth cold, but this place served their broth super cold the broth was slushy with ice. The side dishes were really good and there was a good variety of banchan including sweet potatos, fish cake, cucumber, kimchi, etc. They also gave us this steamed egg side dish on the house, I'm guessing for the inconvenience of initially saying they didn't have nengmyun. I would definitely say this place has the best nengmyun in the valley and you get a good portion size and it comes with slices of meat (which Hodori does not give you in their nengmyun and I will never go back to Hodori to eat it because of that).  Our service was good, the manager or owner came by and asked how everything tasted. No complaints here and I will definitely be back many many more times during the summer to enjoy this super delicious and refreshing cold noodle dish!"}
{"text":"Um your hours say you close at 2. It is 11pm and y'all close. I'm sad. I drove 3 hours for this. Y'all food good tho so...."}
{"text":"Location: it is located in the same plaza as Lee Lee supermarket. There are many tables as well as booths to choose from. Restaurant is relatively clean. Parking is limited in front of the restaurant, but you can always park closer to the supermarket and walk over.   Service: I love the staffs! They are always friendly and attentive every single time I am here. Occasionally, the owners behind the kitchen will waive at us on our way out.   Food: they have this combo that allows you to order a decent size dish (ex: Korean BBQ or Ribs) that comes with a Tofu soup of your choice. That is what I normally order here. If you know Kim Chi, theirs are always fresh and generous when you need refill. I also love their spicy fish red noodles.   Rating: I am a regular here and this is one of my favorite Korean restaurants in AZ."}
