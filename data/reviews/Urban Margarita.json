{"text":"First time trying this place since the name change. Loved the ambience and the patio is great. Pity about the sooty table though. Intriguing main menu but we went for the street tacos for lunch. We were disappointed with the lack of seasoning. The meat in the chicken tacos was completely bland and dry. We should have asked for more condiments or salsa. However we appreciated our waiter (Joe) taking the time to talk to us and get our feedback."}
{"text":"Not what I expected. The taco deal is 2 Tacos for $9 or 3 Tacos $12 but they do not mix and match. I wanted a carnitas and a chicken taco but was told I have to pay a la carte for that. This makes no sense! No chips and salsa either. You have to pay for that too. Tacos were bland with no flavor. Service was sub par at best. Way too expensive! Not recommending this place at all"}
{"text":"My favorite food is Mexican food, so I've pretty much been to them all. This is definitely not my favorite Mexican place. No chips and salsa--what is a Mexican food night out without chips and salsa? The atmosphere is nice, the service was not horrible, but not great. Fajitas had ok flavor but the toppings are enough for only 1 fajita and I asked for 1 more tortilla and they waitress said they only come in orders of 2 and charged me extra for a cold tiny tortilla that we waited at least 10 minutes for! $3.19 for the tiniest bowl of black beans ever! Very stingy for the prices they charge. Probably won't go back"}
{"text":"They have a taco menu that's so good. This place has a good vibe and a bit modern. Lots of tvs and crazy amounts of interesting margaritas."}
{"text":"This restaurant just changed from The Nosh to Urban Margarita. The owner Mike, and most of the staff (including Aaron, the greatest waiter around)! are the same, but the decor and menu have changed, while still keeping a few of the popular dishes from The Nosh menu. All of the food we tried tonight was delicious, from the cheese crisp paired with 5 different dipping sauces, to shredded chicken tacos, to baja tacos. And they kept our favorite dessert, the Creme Brulee trio. A great place to visit, and still our favorite restaurant in this area of town."}
{"text":"Horrible service and the food was mediocre at best. You cannot mix and match tacos, it is an up charge if you do. I had the shrimp tacos and literally looked like they were just thrown together, no flavor. I don't get how this place has gotten good reviews, do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Eh.... my $10 Moscow mule was ok and the app nachos were not that good. Unfortunately service was lacking as well. Sadly I expected a lot more for the location and prices."}
{"text":"My wife and I just moved to Glendale and stumbled into Urban Margarita. It was opening night. Apparently the restaurant has taken on a new name and new food concept, name and identity. I have to say I was very impressed with the service, the owner and staff were very visible and very attentive. The food was also very good. I had the veggie and naked Baja tacos, my wife had shrimp. The food was reasonably priced and was delicious. I was even more impressed with how efficiently the staff was able to serve the entire restaurant on the first night give that the place was very busy. The bar scene was also pretty lively."}
{"text":"The new owners are so nice but they need to pick it up a notch. It's impossible to make a cheap margarita taste good so bump up the price of your house marg and make it taste better! Also, flauta shells should be crispy throughout. Mine were mostly soft."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come and try this local spot and I'm extremely disappointed. I don't even know where to start with the food, it was absolutely terrible and I'm astonished at all the great reviews. The Mexican street corn was canned corn with some chili powder and a little cotija cheese added on top...HORRIBLE. Then my tacos were made with store bought corn tortillas that were uncooked and cold with store bought shredded cheese. When we requested salsa it was like it came straight out of the jar. The cucumber jalape√±o margarita tasted like pure sugar and was disappointing. The food was definitely overpriced. Carol the server was sweet and probably the best part of the experience. Overall, I would never recommend this place to anyone and will definitely not be coming back."}
{"text":"Came for an appetizer and drink.  Tried a pink grapefruit margarita and didn't care for it.  My wife had a blood orange margarita that was very good.  I asked the bartender if she would swap out the grapefruit for the blood orange.  She said she would but would have to charge me for the two sips I had taken, from the grapefruit.  I asked to speak with the manager.  The owner came up and told me the same  thing.  He finally realized he was in the customer service business and gave me a new drink without charge.  One shouldn't have to p through all those changes.  Our waitress was nice and the food was ok.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great new place for food and drinks in a fun, upscale environment!  If you've been before in the past and had a bad experience, try them again.  It is now under new management.  Everything we ordered was delicious, but I especially loved the pork belly tacos and cucumber jalapeno margaritas.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great place, just re-opened with all new menu and drinks. Had the Naked Baja tacos and they were excellent."}
{"text":"For the price you're paying you'd expect to leave full. Not the case here. The tacos (at $4 a pop) were small and barely had enough meat on them. The stuffed pepper dish was ok, meat was dry so it relied heavily on the queso to soften the chicken up. The \"cilantro\" lime rice had 1 piece of cilantro on it as more of a garnish.   Honestly, if you want a good taco place this isn't it. If you want an overpriced watering hole then drink up."}
{"text":"Awesome little place.  Clean, hip, delicious food.  Great mix of items on the menu.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in UM this past Saturday for Cinco De Mayo for lunch and had the best time.  We met the owners Dave and his wife (we didn't catch her name) and they were both very friendly.  We had the house margi's, sangria and nachos and they were the best.  The margi's are made with agave mix and lime - not the pre made stuff and you can tell the difference.  The restaurant is bright and open along with a great bar area and plenty of seating.  The staff is friendly and we felt right at home at the bar sipping our drinks and chatting with the owners and staff.  And, they have happy hour every day of the week even on weekends so check it out.  We will be going back very soon."}
{"text":"Very frustrating first visit! On a date with my wife, we were seated at a table in the bar area and that's when the service stopped. A waitress that had tables 5 feet away from us looked at us several times and never took our drink order. We waited 15 minutes without being served. When another couple came in and were served right away we decided to leave.   Terrible first impression and experience. Probably won't be back, took our business to another local Mexican food restaurant."}
{"text":"Queso dip tastes like Ritz Cracker cheese warmed up. Too much onion flavor over powering the salsa. WAY Over priced. We ordered chips and dip, 9 tacos, and 2 bloody Mary's ($5 each) and total was $62.76 before tip. We should've went to Chipotle. Much better flavor and definitely not over-priced. I guess the price is to make up for the nice decor and layout of the restaurant, which I at least thought looked good."}
{"text":"Such a beautiful restaurant with amazing food and service! Great place for food, drinks, and to spend time with friends and family! I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is my NEW favorite place!! I had the white fish which was mahi mahi and it was amazing!! SO good!! My wife loved the Urban Margarita and i had a daft beer. The atmosphere was nice and I got to catch the Pats fame. You gotta try the chocolate taco. Amazing!!"}
{"text":"We are here a few weeks ago while in Phoenix. We had had a long day at the grand canyon & wanted something quick but good bear our hotel. I spotted this on yelp & decided to give it a try & was pleased. We started with chips,  salsa, & guac; this was some of the best guac I have ever had. I believe I had the pork belly tacos  (I was so tired while there, I don't recall I may have had carnitas) the tacos were good.  My husband had the puffy tacos which were amazing. Service was great! The atmosphere was nice & one I wish we would of has time to sit & enjoy."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant.  Incredible staff and delicious food. This is a hidden gem but not for long!"}
{"text":"First time here and really disappointed.  I read reviews and expected good food.  The place did have nice decor and was not busy.  Hostess was friendly and sat us promptly.  Server was ok, nothing spectacular although she did seem a little put off when asked a question about one of the dishes.  Food was by far the biggest disappointment.  The chicken tacos were just ok, chicken seemed old.  Fajitas, not very good at all, hardly any flavor except that which came from the peppers and onions, meat was sparse and old, guacamole came out brown as if it had been sitting for a while, cheese seemed low quality and stale.  Green Chile burger was a disappointment, and this comes from a 16 year old who will eat just about anything - he only ate a quarter of it.  Few selections on the menu.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Really cute place. Dinner was 3.5 stars, brunch was not as tasty. Service was better at night, too.  Very limited brunch menu for someone who doesn't eat meat. It is mostly beef and pork. I had the Mexican Chicken and Waffles, which was not great. Small portion of chicken, and the waffles were quite bland.   Stick with dinner, which is a more appealing option at this restaurant. (I am trying to think of the name of the dish I had, which was average, and the name of hubby's, which he said was very good, but the restaurant's on-line menu is not functioning and I am drawing two big blanks.)"}
{"text":"I was skeptical based on some of the reviews but wanted to see it for myself. The new decor is fun and trendy to match the new name. Barnwood/aluminum panels in design and the bar was simple and clean. I was greeted at the door immediately but had to wait on my husband and after a few minutes of waiting I was asked if they could give me some water or anything... We wound up sitting at the bar, the bartender Aaron (not sure of the spelling) was friendly and punctual in greeting us and getting us menus. I ordered the Urban Margarita and immediately loved it. A nice smoothe drink, no heartburn! My husband tasted mine and then ordered the same. We only ordered the chips with the 3 dip trio+ guacamole and the cheese crisp with dipping sauces. The dipping sauces for the cheese crisp were a little odd in presentation, but were very good in flavor. The cheese crisp was great... Nice and crispy the way we like them in Arizona. We were impressed and were pleasantly surprised. We did overhear one table send some food back for being undercooked and we did order a chicken and cheese quesadilla to take home for our son. It was undercooked as a lot of the cheese in the middle didn't melt. Hopefully just some correction in the kitchen will remedy this. I hope they do well and iron out any kinks. I want them to do well as this is a place I could love. One flaw, there was a slight sewage smell just as we were getting ready to leave. Sometimes this is bad plumbing...I hope they can find the cause and fix this. Overall I would recommend to friends and I will go back."}
{"text":"The drinks were fine but the coffee and food were cold and the service was not great. We will not be back. If you want to check this place out I'd do it soon, because I don't think they will be around long.   We ordered:  Coffee- COLD - the waitress said it was hot out of the pot but she put a cold spoon in it?? We told her we didn't want it and she said ok and  then left the cup there, and then came back 5 min later and took the cup. Mimosa - Good Bloody Mary- Good California Skillet- Good flavor but was lukewarm, cold homestyle potatoes Urban Skillet- Flavor was ok but eggs were lukewarm, cold scalloped potatoes"}
{"text":"The prices are high for the quantity of the portions. $9.50 for 3 mini chimis the size of an egg roll. Jalape√±o and cream cheese filled. Tasted good but other comparable restaurants serve 12 beef or chicken for the same price.  Clean,  modern look. Friendly server.  $50 after $5 tip for two burritos and 3 mini chimis,  we should have gone to taco bell and saved $40"}
{"text":"I loved the environment and the food.  The menu offers different items than your typical Mexican restaurant.  Sat at the bar, great bartenders, friendly staff, food was exactly what we expected.  I'm really glad to see something different and not another food chain in the area.  Saw the sign outside that said under new management and looked at recent reviews and that's why we tried it, we will definitely go again and have recommended it to friends and family already."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining here last Tuesday and I was extremely happy with everything we experienced. The food was amazing. We had the Short Rib Flautas (soooo good) and the Crispy Calamari (also delicious) to start and the pork belly and Baja tacos as our main meal (so delicious!!). We washed it down with a House Margarita that was super tasty. The restaurant is under new ownership and I was lucky enough to meet the new owners, David and Kimberly. They are doing great things with this restaurant and I would highly recommend this place to anyone in the area. The quality of the ingredients were top notch!  You will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Same people that owned The Nosh. Amazing food. Great menu with creative Baja style dishes. The bacon wrapped shrimp in the cherry BBQ sauce was my favorite. Love the new concept!"}
{"text":"Support Local. Mike has done a great job at transforming this local spot from The Nosh to Urban Margarita. Vegetarian tacos were delicious. Black beans also great. $6 skinny and house margaritas. My husband ordered vegetarian fajitas that were tasty. Come support Mike and team. JT is still the infamous Friday night and Sunday morning bartender. #supportlocal"}
{"text":"We enjoy this place for the nice bar area. We've visited a couple of times for tacos and guacamole. The service is excellent and friendly.  I always get the vegetarian tacos and they are quite filling. They have the usual local stuff on tap. This is a nice local spot in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"First visit here, really enjoyed it. Great tasting food, nice ambiance and attentive service. Our Server, Taylor, was Amazing! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"FINALLY, a hip, down town style restaurant with AMAZING food, in the West Valley.  If you have been here before, you need to come again.  Ownership has just changed, and I will be back here weekly.  Even my son, who says he never wants Mexican food, is bugging me to go back.  I had the Nachos, and it is Nacho Average plate of food!!  The carnitas were delicioso, and you must try the Watermelon Margarita!  Anyway, happy to have you here, and I will see you soon!"}
{"text":"Michelle was an amazing server, very attentive & personable. The food was delicious...I always enjoy their tacos with the specialty sauces! Sweet Jalape√±o jelly is by far my favorite."}
{"text":"Awesome!!!! The fish tacos are outstanding and I live for fish tacos! Great place for a nice date night! And all the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is SO Much better than Betty's Nosh! Our server Erika was so helpful and friendly! I recommend the skinny margarita and the tacos. We will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"This is Betty's Nosh with a different menu. I'm fed up with \"Mexican\" restaurants in AZ thinking AZ people have never eaten tacos. This place has been open 3 days and was not full tonight. I asked what the specialties were and I was told \"I don't know. We've been open 3 days.\" Same gorgeous patio btw but that's about it. Ordered lemon for my water- I had to ask 3x. Got drinks after our \"appetizer.\"  We had the Trio which was chips (not homemade, cold and along the lines of Taco Bell chips), a tablespoon each of black beans (likely from a can, queso and the most mild Pace picante sauce you could find. I think it was like $8. Then the tacos.. 2 street tacos for like $8 PLUS and additional charge of $1.50 for carne asada. Huh? I got the shrimp tostada which was the same cold beans and a few tasteless shrimp. We told 2 people that our meals were tasteless and they didn't care. My very best advice to my neighbors is to go to Barrio Queen at Desert Ridge or Tacos Tijuana on 67th Ave/Thunderbird for amazing carne asada tacos at 4 bucks each."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, amazing drinks and service!   Thank you so much JT and Aaron.    You guys did a fantastic job!  Without them it wouldn't be the same.  Thank you for the great night."}
{"text":"As a person that grew up in Mexico, I am disappointed with this restaurant and their food. The salsa is NOT home made, it came out of the can, so sad! Also, both the corn and flour tortillas were cold and not good. I am sorry to leave a bad review but I cannot believe what I just had. The service was probably the best part but all our food was bad and overpriced."}
{"text":"Thought we would try them out since we were in the area.  Unfortunately, we were very disappointed.  Come on guys....charging for chips and salsa!!!  Had to send the chips back since they were stale and the salsa was terrible....chef loves onions!  You pay dinner prices for lunch...pretty pricey!  I had the tortilla soup which would have been better if they had used quality chicken instead of cheaper cuts of chicken.  My husband said the tacos were ok, but nothing to write home about.  Later in the evening he had an after taste in his mouth similar to that of msg.  Sorry folks; we won't be back!"}
{"text":"Eh. I've been here twice now - once for brunch and once for dinner.  There are really no brunch items for someone who doesn't eat meat, which was surprising given that Mexican restaurants are frequently very veggie friendly.  My brunch-mates were also unimpressed with their dishes; they thought it was bland.   The dinner menu was ok, and the jalapeno pineapple margarita was nice, but the chips & salsas appetizer was very bland. The salsas probably came out of cans. I wanted to like this place because it's so close to my house, but I don't think I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Wow. Somewhere in the West valley with ceviche that is amazing! A wonderful atmosphere, amazing service by the bartender, and if I'm not mistaken half priced bottles of wine on Mondays!!!! I'll be back with friends and family!"}
{"text":"The interior was awesome and the staff was beyond nice and attentive. The house Margarita was really good which if it wasn't would have been a huge let down cause Margarita is in their name. The food was average. The taco fillings were good but the tortilla left it being lack luster.  I would still come back for the Margarita."}
{"text":"Carol our server was the best, this is the second time she has assisted our table of 6 or more and she did a marvelous job. She knows and understands the menu, she can assist with some great recommendations and is always there when you need assistance. The green chili cheeseburger was loved by all who ordered, the salmon was fantastic and my wife had the puffy short rib tacos-they were good but she would have like a little more of the short ribs in the tacos. Love the new owners, atmosphere and food we will return."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Food was great, service was amazing and the beer was ice cold. The tacos were on point. I can't think of a better place for a beer and lunch on a beautiful Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"I love this location and while the place is cute, they changed nothing from when it was Nosh.  It was pretty empty when we went on a Sunday night which is concerning.  Service and food was ok...would really love to see the menu take it up a notch.  Offering items out of the ordinary would really make this place stand out.  Better/brighter lighting and more upbeat ambiance would help too."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband and parents last night. We were excited to try this place since we had been to Betty's nosh before.  I loved the decor inside, modern farmhouse I would say.  We started with the cheese crisp appetizer. It said it came with 5 sauces so we were excited to try it.  When it came out the cheese crisp looked really good, but the problem was there was a slice of cheese crisp moved over and a spoonful of the sauces just slapped on the plate. The salsa type sauce ran under all the slices and made it less crispy. It was just strange. But I will say it was good! Our dinners were shrimp tostada,  stuffed peppers, naked Baja tacos and mahi mahi fish dinner. The stuffed peppers was my dinner and it was fantastic! I loved it!! My mom liked her tacos and my husband thought the shrimp tostada was good! My dads mahi mahi came out under cooked. They did take it back and cooked it longer. They were very nice about it and even brought out cake to make up for it. They made things right and cared the customer was happy. It was a good place! I will come back for the peppers for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in because it was close to home. Greeted and sat pretty quickly. Nice inside. Food terrible. Ordered stuffed peppers. No flavor. Added salt to everything.  Temperature  was warm so I sent them back. They came back with a new plate and I promise it was the same temperature.  Ordered churros. COVERED in cinnamon sugar (caked on) and too hard. Same churros you buy from box and they charge $8. Not impressed. Also new management means nothing."}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming our favorite place on the northwest side of town.  Great food, good service and atmosphere.  If you like tacos, not the taco bell kind,  they are the best here.  Great selection but not an overwhelming menu.     The atmosphere has a family feel and very relaxed."}
{"text":"Real bummer when you enjoy your margaritas and food so much that you see then again the next day. My husband had a burrito and ended up with food poisoning. Hes having non stop nausea vomiting and diarrhea. Which is perfect since were supposed to be boarding a flight right now. Im beyond furious. He had told me that he had heard negative reviews about this place. But little me argued away because i wanted to try it. My stomach hurts so im sure my turn to take over the bathroom is coming soon. Im disappointed and angry. Guess the poor reviews he had hears about were right. Thanks urban marg! (Intense amounts of sarcasm)."}
{"text":"AWESIME food!  The best margaritas!!   Super great service also.  Julie, the owner stopped by several times to check on us.  Really awesome lady!  I would recommend this restaurant!  Super yummy!"}
{"text":"Service was absolutely amazing.  Not only was the waiter very responsive and attentive but the manager stopped by multiple times to check in and make sure all was well. Food was also quality as the green chili nachos were the reason I stopped by and I wasn't disappointed.  They use a true Hatch Green Chili Sauce that being from New Mexico I approve of."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, good vibes. Nice outside patio for the evenings.   We had the chicken chimis, some margaritas, fish tacos and the burrito.   Everything was great. Zero complaints. We have sat at the bar both times we've been here. Quality service and quality food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"The food was great, especially the chicken tacos and nachos!! The staff was polite and the drinks were amazing!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"These three stars are for the service and culinary delights alone. Once they settle in over time, and the price points become a touch easier on the bank account...  ... I can see this establishment easily earning the reputation as the best overall Mexican experience within the Glendale/Peoria 101 corridor."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious! Ordered guacamole for an appetizer. The taste was so fresh.  Not overly spicy. The recipe has white Mexican cheese in it. The Urban Margarita Burro comes with your choice of protein. I went with the pollo asada( diced pieces of white meat chicken). The rice, black beans and veggies inside the burro were fresh and delicious.  I added the green chili enchilada sauce. It was delicious and not too spicy. My husband loved the chicken stuffed poblano pepper.  The cilantro lime rice was excellent. The show stopper was the side of Mexican corn. The corn itself tastes fresh picked and flavorful. Service was fast and friendly. The owners stop by to check on you. Nice touch!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I went here last Friday. Our server was great and the margarita I ordered was good. We both ordered the taco combination plate. He seemed to like his plate. The Baja and shrimp tacos I ordered were good, but my mistake was ordering the veggie taco. This was the first one I ate and I immediately felt sick afterwards. I barely ate the last two which were actually good before we had to leave. I spent the entire weekend sick with food poisoning. Can't say the tacos were good enough for me to risk another trip back."}
{"text":"Updating review since there are new owners and some changes. The menu has a few new items since the previous owners changed this restaurant to its new name. Many Mexican items and the bar tender was pushing the Enchiladas. Since I really like enchiladas I ordered them and asked for one pork and one chicken. They were very good however not anything special that would bring me back for enchiladas. What disappointed me was that I felt rushed during my visit. I like to relax and enjoy my food and drink without the server being pushy. I had just been handed my drink and the menu when a minute later I was asked if I was ready to order food. Some may think this is good service however I felt rushed. Then, after being served both drinks I was asked if I wanted another when I was not more than 2/3 finished with the drink I had. This is a problem for me as I feel I am being rushed and being sold more product before I am ready. Lastly, I am a clean freak when it comes to dining so I prefer not to shake hands with anyone before my meal. Many bars including this one have bartenders who try to be overly friendly and introduce themselves and shake your hand. Sorry but not what I am interested in before I order food. Your name is all I need. Much of what I am not happy with could very well just be the newness of the restaurant and staff settling in so I will give it another try."}
{"text":"We won't be back. Terrible service. Food was pretty good, but you have to ask for everything! (Ketchup, salsa, tortillas for fajitas: upcharge) then I ordered a burger med-well. Came med-rare. Sent it back (because who wants a belly ache? not me) and they reheated it, destroying it in the process. I got the original soggy bun back too! Then our server told us SHE ordered it medium instead of what we asked for because she thought it would be better, but it came out medium rare. Needless to say I couldn't even eat it. Someone was touching it and pulling it apart to reheat, and then tried to put it back together. Eww. We paid and left thirsty (because I never had a refill either!)"}
{"text":"This place is not a Gastro pub like it portrays itself to be... they need to look up what a real one is before they call it that this is a place that serves low quality and processed food same quality u can get at rubios at double the cost... it's not that it's u. Edible was really disappointed and felt scammed for how much the food is and quality that we got it... was eye appealing until u actually start eating it and realized you could have gotten the same thing literally for half the cost if not more"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere & food!  Service was friendly and fast but not rushed.  Very welcoming staff.  Patio seating is available also.  The cheese crisp is sooo yummy with 5 unique and super tasty dipping sauces.  Not your average greasy cheese crisp.  The stuffed peppers were suggested, so I tried them. They were Delicious!  Food was all way above average.  All kinds of beer and cocktails plus some yummy speciality margaritas!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"New owners and great food! The carnitas tacos were delicious! Great selection of margaritas. Chips are fresh as is the salsa and guacamole. Love this place!"}
{"text":"We loved the ambience and of course, the margaritas. We devoured our fish entrees. Great place in an ideal location."}
{"text":"We tried this place out this past weekend. The tacos and margaritas were great! The prickly pear margarita and blood orange margarita were delish. We will be back."}
{"text":"We  have been going to this restaurant since way back in the Betty's Nosh days.  It is our local watering hole with great bartenders, great servers and a relaxed, wonderful atmosphere. Since then, it has changed changed owners twice and name once.  We are very impressed since the newest owners, Dave and Kim have taken over.  Dave has some real culinary experience and they have some great ideas of what they are going to do with the menu and the entertainment, hoping to add live music on a regular basis.  Since the new owners have taken over, I have been twice for brunch and my husband has been once for dinner.  I have had the eggs benedict and the huevos rancheros for brunch.  Both were excellent.  Dave makes a hell of a hollindaise sauce!  My son had the Frosted Flakes french toast.  Delish!  My husband had the steak when he went for dinner, which he said was excellent.  When you combine the food, the service and the wonderful servers and bartenders, Carrie, Aaron and JT with the relaxed, easy, fun atmosphere, you have a winner!"}
{"text":"The French toast was delicious and I loved the crunchy pieces! The breakfast burrito was also good but I would have a preferred a little more heat (jalape√±os), next time I'll ask to add them.  Also the Bloody Mary was wonderful! And only $4, solid choice!"}
{"text":"OMG.....I saw that this was under new ownership and my wife and I went in to give it a try. They had absolutely the most amazing pork belly tacos. I can't remember having anything as tasty as these. I also like the fact that the owners were so hands on and greeted and seated us. Seems to be such great people. Highly recommend giving them a try. You wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Nice experience! New ownership, new menu, some familiar staff faces. The service was great & so was the food. I had the Puffy Short Rib Tacos, they came w/blk beans & cilantro lime rice...it all had a natural taste, which I appreciate. Our drinks quenched our thirst & the space is very pretty with a good ambience. We had the pleasure of meeting the new owners, David & Kimberly, who took the time to greet us & engage in a nice conversation. They have happy hour drink & appetizer specials daily and an enticing Sunday brunch menu - check them out! Help keep them around so we have more 'go to spots' in this area."}
{"text":"Peach and mango Bellinis - ummm yes PLEASE! The tacos were slamming and nice portion sized - I will be going here for brunch more often - can't wait to try the breakfast tacos!"}
{"text":"2/11/18 830PM  Arrived and the doors were locked. Door and Yelp states 9PM. Rather unfortunate to make this your reputation."}
{"text":"First time here and we had a great experience!! The margaritas were great and the food was awesome as well! Our server was extremely prompt and very friendly. We will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Great service, staff kept checking on us to ask if we needed anything. Had cheese crisp for appetizer & the sauces were good but one was too sweet. Could have used spicier salsa options. Shrimp tostadas & tiger shrimp were very good. Beer that we chose had just arrived & not chilled so had to order a different one. Margaritas were weak but good flavor. Will return to try other entrees."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service. Restaurant was not that busy, but our server NEVER checked in on us even once. I ordered carne asada fries and I was eating it slow hoping our server would come over so I could ask for some hot sauce. An hour and a half passes and my fries are cold and still no server in sight. I don't know if it was a race thing or what, because my girlfriend and I were the only non-Caucasians in the whole restaurant, and everyone else was checked in on multiple times. I tried to wave servers down multiple times, but they completely disregarded me.  Now onto the food... My fries tasted like they were burnt, and my girlfriends nachos tasted very bland. All we ordered was a margarita, the carne asada fries, and nachos. The total was $42! I would have gotten better food at filibertos. Never going here again."}
{"text":"My wife and I thought we'd give this place a try.  We stopped by on a Saturday at noon for lunch and the place was empty.  We ordered chips and salsa (which was 6.00 for a small bowl of salsa btw) and looked over a very unimpressive menu.  I ordered the fish tacos (naked Baja) my wife ordered grilled chicken tacos. Presentation was great but taste was mediocre at best.  Over salted and far too much raw onion.  My guess is this restaurant won't last but a few more months.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere in convenient location. We ordered several appetizers and enjoyed them all. We had very prompt and courteous service. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Wow, loved the tacos....and Josh was very knowledgeable on their new menu....a must try!"}
{"text":"I had such a refreshing experience here!  I came with a couple of friends for happy hour and the service was fantastic!  I am so excited their are new owners and happy we have such a great new spot on the West side!"}
{"text":"A true gem in our neighborhood. Everything is fresh, and the array of sauces is stellar. The service can't be beat, and it is evident that the entire staff has a personal investment in the establishment. Probably the best street taco I've ever had. We'll be coming here for our date night every week!"}
{"text":"I've thoroughly enjoyed two recent experiences at Urban Margarita.   I recommend the stuffed peppers and the fajitas.  Their guacamole is to some of the best in the Valley.   Great for cocktails with a standout margarita menu all made with fresh ingredients.   The atmosphere is casual with a hint of hipster."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. Very good. Their signature nachos were unusually hot last night. Tasted like someone spilled a jar of jalape√±os. Not usually that hot. I would recommend this place for a taste of something different in southwestern, Mexican style food. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I went here with a group yesterday. We had the WORST service. The first part of the party arrived a few minutes before the rest of us and were able to get an order in. Once a few more of us arrived, we had to wave someone down after 10-15 minutes to get a drink order. The drinks didn't come out for 20 min. I will say, my white peach sangria was really good. The last part of the group waited for over 40 minutes and no one came to get their order. When some food finally did arrive, it was wrong. The entire time, no apologies for any of it. In fact, to the contrary, the manager and staff were rather rude. We finally left and went next door just so the rest of our party could get some dinner. One of the worst experiences I have had at a restaurant with regard to service. Urban Margarita just lost 15 customers - we all agreed we would never go back."}
