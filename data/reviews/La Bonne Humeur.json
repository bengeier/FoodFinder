{"text":"Leave your grumpy mood at the door here. Friendliest staff in town. They have a simple, basic menu with a (delicious and homemade) soup and (not so homemade, box-cake that we all crave once in a while) dessert included in the price. Coffee in. Taxes in. From ham steak with pineapple to pâté chinois, la bonne humeur is stocked with the Québécois diner staples, forget the fries- they come with traditional mashed potatoes, steamed veg and/or salad. Their cod and sole are delicious, pan-fried perfectly. And you actually do leave in a good mood."}
{"text":"I went downstairs and turned left, that's how I found the restaurant my friend kept telling about after checking out our AirBnb rental. Frankly, I thought she was crazy. Still, I decided to give it a shot. Alain and Gaetan made my day. In less than 24 hours, I was there twice and plan on having breakfast on Tuesday before my flight departs. First meal was pan fried sole (was told it was caught that day) with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. The meal included a cabbage soup and dessert (some kind of sponge cake with a caramel sauce) as well. This is probably the cleanest piece of fish I've ever had. It was cooked delicately as most places can't cook a fish to save their life, but this place just blew me away. It was succulent and savory. Mashed potatoes were done just right, without being overly whipped. La soupe aux choux was so good that I'm still dreaming of the broth. It was the kind of meal that gives you a hug and tells you everything is going to be alright.  The following day I made it in just before closing to have boeuf bourguignon and grabbed some coffee.  This meal also included mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables. The soup of the day was a tomato based vegetable soup and dessert, some kind of apple cobbler.  The boeuf just melted in my mouth. I don't recall chewing. To be honest, it didn't have a fighting chance. Coffee and dessert were the perfect way to end the meal.   Simple comfort food that is done right and \"California\" will be back for breakfast."}
{"text":"Howdy!  After the late and lamented closing of Chez Clo, Montreal has lacked in the quantity of restaurants serving more traditional Quebecois fare. The Binerie kind of ruled the roost.   I recently discovered La Bonne Humeur. A cute and delightful restaurant on a mainly residential strip of Bellechase. Open for breakfast and lunch, the food that they serve is both delicious and hearty. Which is a very good thing as the weather turns cold.  Traditional food such as Sausages, Liver and Ham steak are on the menu which is supplemented by a daily special which changes as you would expect, daily. Alain and Gilles Cauvier are the two brothers who run the place.   Alain handles breakfasts and Gilles handles lunch. The meals are extremely affordable and delicious as well. On a recent visit I ate a stuffed meatloaf with a tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and steamed carrots that was $9 and came with a cream of mushroom soup to start with and upsidedown fruit cake for dessert."}
