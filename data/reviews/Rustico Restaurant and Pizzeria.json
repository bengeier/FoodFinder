{"text":"Refined authentic Italian in a sleek spacious dining room with a lovely patio deck. It's on the pricey end, as is everything on the island, but this is more worth the premium. We ate there twice in one week and enjoyed the handmade pasta and gnocchi more than the pizza.   The orecchiette with sausage and sundried tomato was our favorite; smoky and flavorful. The ricotta gnocchi with pumpkin, shiitake, and asparagus was also excellent, although there was very little asparagus and only the stalks, no asparagus tips. The lobster ravioli was good but the creamy tomato/alla vodka sauce it was served with made it difficult to taste the lobster. Our least favorite dish was the margherita pizza, which had very little tomato sauce and mozzarella, and no basil. The desserts we tried - panna cotta, crème brûlée, and molten chocolate cake - were all quite good.  Service is very prompt and helpful with recommendations. The restaurant gets pretty busy, especially on weekends, so make a reservation. We were able to squeeze in by sitting at the bar on our first visit but made sure to call for reservations the second time."}
{"text":"This is a very good Italian restaurant nestled right in the middle of the beautiful Bermuda island... Nice ambiance and great service; definitely recommend visiting while on the island."}
{"text":"Wow! Was expecting some good Italian, but this was whole other level good! The homemade beef lasagna melted in our mouths with a sauce that had obviously been given some time like a bolognese. The truffle mushroom pizza was so tasty and perfectly balanced. I can tell the Italians who work there (may own the place, not sure) really know what they're doing in the kitchen. And they know where Cremona (our last name is from) is to boot! Go check it out! You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"We read that this restaurant had the best Italian  in Bermuda so being ready for something other then fish, we jumped on our scooters and went! It is a nice restaurant an area called the Flats halfway to Hamilton from Grotto Bay Beach and Resort (where we are staying). It was on the small side but had cloth table-clothes and napkins. Lots of employees who were very attentive. We ordered salad and a pizza but they had other Italian dishes. All meals in Bermuda are expensive...period...so this place is no excepts but we asked for just regular water ( driving back on scooters and possible in rain AND dark) and we were charged $8 a bottles and for two bottles was $16! They did have regular water from pitchers we saw but we were given the expensive water! Be forwarned!  The pizzas are thin but tasty and salad was nice but small. It looked like the richer people ate here and were willing to pay whatever the price! The restaurant is located on the edge of an ocean inlet which had the most beautiful blue water and colorful houses dotted on the hillside!"}
{"text":"We went looking for a local dining experience and found Rustico on Yelp.  Centrally located near the aquarium, short taxi ride from our hotel.  Had the eggplant parmigiana and their pizza too.  Both were excellent. Waiter was very attentive and was reasonably priced.  Would highly recommend!!"}
