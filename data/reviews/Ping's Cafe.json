{"text":"We moved here from the east coast and weren't sure what to expect from this restaurant.   I must say we were pleasantly surprised.  The food was very good!  This place doesn't look like much from the outside but the inside was decorated very nicely with plently of tables & booths.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Egg drop soup is excellent. Had the Mongolian Beef. Kids had the orange chicken. Service was quick and very friendly. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Good food at a great price.  My lunch came with soup, spring roll,and  cream puff for around $6.  I reccomend the house chicken with brown rice."}
{"text":"Not wanting to complain but beware. Our soup was brought to the table lukewarm.

Our orders were to have white or steamed rice with our meal it came instead with brown rice. 

When they brought the fried noodles and the sweet-and-sour sauce, the sauce was   Watered down.  Certainly much runnier then any sauce I've had any other Chinese restaurant.

My wife loves Chinese food and steamed rice and she found this place to be horrible."}
{"text":"This is our family's favorite Chinese restaurant in Fountain Hills. The Hot and Sour soup is a personal favorite as well as the Walnut Shrimp!  Friendly staff and delicious food."}
{"text":"I have been to Ping's in the past and the food was fine. I stopped in last night for some to go food for my family. The food was terrible. we had teriyaki chicken, sweet-and-sour chicken and chicken lo mein. Nothing was good. The meet had a bad taste to it and was not tender. I do not suggest this place."}
{"text":"Decided to try Ping's again and I'm so happy we did!  The food is back to what we have always loved from them-mouthwatering, flavorful, crispy and everything the epitome of how it should be.  The portions again were correct with plentiful beef accented by correct amount of vegetables.  We always have gotten carry-out so I can't speak for any server or timing.  I'm thrilled to put Ping's back on our regular rotation!"}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the worst Chinese restaurant I've been to my entire life.
As soon as we walked in the place reeked of old frying oil smell. I knew it was gonna be bad after that smell invaded my nose. 
We order chicken curry wings as an appetizer which was horrible. Frozen wings dumped in an old frying oil then mixed with an awful tasting curry sauce!! And the potato steak fries that was mixed with the wings and the sauce was frozen and cold. 
We also ordered sweet and sour chicken entree and crispy duck entree. Both are horrible, the sweet and sour chicken was below average at best and the crispy duck was definitely not fresh and I'm pretty sure it was reheated multiple times. 
We didn't eat the white rice as it had a very bad smell besides being very dry. 
It was a waste of time and money. 
I strongly advise against going to this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Friendly fun staff!
Visiting from out of town and wish we had a place like this back home. Glad we stopped!"}
{"text":"Been coming here with my dad since 2011. By far best Chinese in Phoenix area. Everything made from scratch you can edit any order add or subtract. I always get their family tofu no spicy and it's amazing. I literally drive from Tempe now to get it."}
{"text":"Tasteless food. Wouldn't go again. Run by family, seem to be chinese but not sure. Service is average. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"I am happy to have found Ping's Cafe, it's right in my hood. Being vegetarian, there are a few dishes I usually order that are delicious... They have generous portions which is the amount any real Chinese restaurant should serve, and the owners are really sweet and accommodating. I can't find much tofu in Founatian Hills, but thank goodness they do!"}
{"text":"Huge portions, very laid back atmosphere. The best fried rice & tofu and veggies in garlic sauce we have tasted in the valley! Owners are great - he is the chef and she takes care of the front."}
{"text":"Zero stars!! Lived in FH for 6 years and have searched for good Chinese. THIS AIN'T IT!! Thought I couldn't find worse than Chens Garden, I was wrong. Ordered Kung Pow Chicken and Moo Goo Gai Ping. I've never tasted Kung Pow like this before, and hope I never do again. Nothing but vinegar. Like drinking it straight from the bottle. Inedible. My daughter's Moo Goo was rubbery. And, to make things just hysterically bad, the fortune cookies were not fortunes, but instead were filled with advertisements. Lol. Who buys fortune cookies with no fortunes??? I paid $25 for white rice, it was the only thing edible. Definitely wasn't worth $25. Tried to call and complain, they weren't receptive. Unfortunately, my only recourse is to deny the charge. 
SKIP IT!!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times. Always happy with the food and good service."}
{"text":"Not the best Chinese food I've ever had but certainly good quality and by far the best in Fountain Hills. My wife and I order from here  a couple times a month using coupons in our daily flyer mail, good food good quality, what else can you say."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch a few months back when I worked up in Fountain Hills.  There was only one person working the whole restaurant during what I think they would consider a lunch rush.  The restaurant is on the small side, but the follow up fell below expectations.  My friend and I found the food to be okay, not the best quality, but what else would you expect with a cheap Chinese lunch."}
{"text":"Well prepared , Good size servings . wide varity of dishes ,  well worth the money. Good menu for non meat eaters. Try the frier toe foo."}
{"text":"Terrible, over priced for what u get which is what i believe msg filled crapy Chinese. ive given them 3 chances with 3 dif dishes for take out. the vibe i get is a retired couple barley hanging on to the place that have lost their passion for food."}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly service.  Used to drive to Scottsdale and never realized the best Chinese option was in Fountain Hills the whole time!  Excited to discover this place."}
{"text":"Despite the fact that every Chinese restaurant in Fountain Hills is already overpriced, how can any venue simultaneously provide sub par food, markup the price, AND stay in business? Awful portions, awful prices, occasionally tasty food."}
{"text":"Try the Hot and Sour soup (especially if you're stuffed up from allergies) - lots of egg and tofu. Love their spices.

Also had chicken chow mien. Tasty, but noodles were a tad overdone.

They may consider redecorating their dining area. Very plain, hole-in-the-wall and that may scare guests away."}
{"text":"First visit, but there will be many more. Kung pao chicken was excellent, the right mix if perfectly prepared chicken, vegetables and scrumptious sauce. My wife asked advice for best veggie meal and was very pleased with suggestion"}
{"text":"Can easily say I will never go back!! When I first walked in, there was nobody in sight. I stood there for five minutes yelling, \"hello?\". Finally someone came out and took my drink order. I ordered the steamed chicken and veggies lunch special; based on the lunch menu, I assumed that this too came with the spring roll, crab puff, and soup, however, I was mistaken and it only came with soup and thank god it did cause that was about the only thing that I could eat. The egg drop was not great by any means but it was edible. When the plate of food came out, it was a huge serving. When I looked at it, it was swimming in sauce; this was supposed to be a \"healthy\" option and it has more sauce then the soup! Yuck!! It was tasteless. I had maybe 3 bites and asked for my check. The server was surprised. I told her I didn't like it and that there was way too much sauce; no offer to make something else, adjust the bill, nothing. So I paid the $7.60 and left. Very disappointing to say the least. There aren't very many places to eat in Fountain Hills and even fewer Chinese food places so just add another one to the \"no thanks\" list!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. I always receive great services from the staff who I assume are the owners. The food is always good, and made to my liking. I only wish more people would come here as it's usually empty when I arrive. The sweet and sour chicken is great."}
{"text":"Wow! This place has definitely come a long way! When they first opened several years ago, this place was the type of restaurant where you would walk up to the counter, order your food and then they'd bring it out. It has since changed to a sit down place with waiter service. 

Having not eaten here in several years, I decided to give them another try. I was pleasantly surprised! I ordered the Pad Thai which was delicious and the portion was extremely generous. The pad thai comes with tofu only, which is right up my alley as I'm a vegetarian. 

On another occasion I had the kung pao tofu, which was also very flavorful.

When I ate here several years ago it was extremely greasy and bland. It has since changed to be a great restaurant that has earned my business back!"}
