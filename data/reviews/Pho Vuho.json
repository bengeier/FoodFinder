{"text":"VuuuuuHooooo!

As other reviewers have mentioned already, this place took over a previous Indian and Chinese cuisine location. We've been waiting for VuHo to open because we love the Vietnamese cuisine. My wife and I decided to visit with two small kids, and we're very happy with the taste, value, and ambiance of Pho Vuho

Normally we order a couple XL 101s whenever we go to a pho place to try it out. However, at this location, I mixed it up with a 315 and it was truly amazing, we already made a return with the kids and my wife got the 315 this time. My kids don't yell at all here so that might have made me happier as well. I don't normally review on Yelp. The only reason I am posting a review on behalf of my wife's account is so this place would stay in business, unlike the previous two predecessors.

The actual review:

Ambiance: one of the best for a Pho, and I've been to more than a few.
Price: normal for a Pho
Portions: normal for a Pho, well, we only order XL noodles because I eat a ton.
Menu: Server was very helpful as I ordered a main and she told me to pick something else because it won't look like the photo, so I ended up with 315 and it was the best 'something like' 315 I've personally had. Also you need to speak up if you want to order drinks as this place does not try to get you $$$ out of your pocket with a drink order question to start as normal practice with Pho joints. So speak up if you want more than regular water or yummy dates tea for drinks!!!
Taste: Now I'm not a picky person, but I went Mmm... Did I mention we watch the food ranger, aka Trevor James, he would give it a big #, but we need more fresh herbs!
Value: Fantabulous, every restaurant that gives you a good time is fantabulous.

Lastly, did I mention the spicy peppers? The pickled garlic? I want to bring some home.

If the owner reads this, please!!! your heating is too hot, save some $$$ and tune the heat down a notch, wait for the winter! We're Canadian, eh?

Big fan of VUUUHOOO!"}
{"text":"Food was good and decently priced. I saw 1 male waiter went in the washroom and i came in right after him. I noticed that the sink was dry with a roll of paper towel inside the sink, bcuz the holder was broken. This was telling me that the male waitress did not wash his hand after doing his deed. You'll be the judge."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, ordered the pho special and avocado shake really tasty and fresh. The restaurant is modern and great atmosphere. I would recommend this to all of my friends and come here again."}
{"text":"I always order the special noodle bowl (#201) whenever I visit a new Vietnamese restaurant, and this one passed with flying colours. The broth was tasty, and there was a generous amount of beef with tendon and tripe. Not too much noodles, and it tasted very fresh. Will definitely be bringing the folks here next time!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best pho in oakville. It's new, but was very busy. Service was excellent, food was delicious and serving sizes were great."}
{"text":"I don't usually review but... this will be my very first!

My go-to meal at a Pho restaurants are usually vermicelli and at this new location I was very impressed!!! Didn't have to wait so long and customer service was above standard, thy were so kind to my friends and I!

Loved my first experience here! I would highly recommend 10/10"}
{"text":"Very good, affordable cuisine, but they no longer accept credit."}
{"text":"So glad we have a new pho place in oakville that is actually good! Prices are very reasonable and the decor is nice and new."}
{"text":"Superb Vietnamese cuisine for Oakville. The owner is a vibrant and energetic young lady from Saigon, or whatever you choose to call it. 

The decor is very modern, and has a classy feel mixed with some hipster decor. Even has a chalk board. I still hate hipsters, but it is nice to see such a modern place in Oakville (finally). 

Okay. Food then. Of course the pho dac biet is the benchmark item for all Vietnamese restos. It is a very flavourful and aromatic broth without being over seasoned and salty. The flavour is quite natural without any MSG detected by me. I appreciate the lack of the MSG crutch, but I know many of my friends would protest. 

Noodles are fresh and have bounce. Meat is generous and the sirloin is placed in raw to be cooked by the SUPER hot broth; the way it ought to be. 

Herbs are VERY fresh, with lots of basil, lime and sprouts, plus one super Red hot chili. 

I have tried the rice dishes, many apps, and the bun bo hue. All are cooked perfectly, generous portions of protein, and made the way mom would do it with a beautiful presentation. 

Service is excellent. 

The place is astoundingly clean to the point you might expect the food quality would suffer. Not the case. Five stars all around.

I'll be back for more. Get outta the way Oliver Twist."}
{"text":"Fresh herbs, good service and most importantly, great broth used for pho.. noodles are standard but ingredients are of good quality. Meats are well cut and not too fatty. Looking forward to coming here many times more"}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant - food is wholesome and fresh, and the service was superb. Make sure to get the fried spring roll, so good! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Not sure at all why this place has 4+ stars. (Edit; I went on to read some more reviews, and most of the 5 star ratings are fake). Please stop paying for reviews.

Drove all the way from sauga to try this place, only to be disappointed. The pho was very mediocre, noodles too soft, and the tendon was harder than the beef balls. I honestly wouldn't even choose this over the average pho mi99 which is literally everywhere. 

On top of the poor food quality, we ordered two bowls, one came 25min after the first because they completely forgot our order. 


tldr; below average pho, forgot our order, waited 45 mins for food."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite pho place in Oakville, followed closely by Yummy Pho. The pho alone is a definite 5/5 however, I wasn't a huge fan of the pad thai or the sauteed chicken curry on vermicelli. 

The pad thai tasted too much of soy sauce instead of the actual pad thai sauce. The sauteed chicken curry on vermicelli had too much sauce. I was expecting this to be more like singapore noodles with the vermicelli sauteed with the chicken (as indicated by the picture on their menu) however, it was literally just sauteed chicken on top of vermicelli noodles. 

These two menus were disappointing but they do have the best pho I've ever tasted.
The broth is clean, vegetables are fresh, and they're not cheap with the meat (unlike some placed that literally give you 3-4 pieces)."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the great services and  all foods on the menu. Unlike other restaurant, the owner is very personalized and approachable.  The foods taste amazing, much better than many other vietnamese restaurants I had been. All friends I brought over kept coming back. I like Pho & Bun Bo HUE."}
{"text":"Charged me wrong price on the bill only noticed when I got home.. not impressed. Also I noticed they are getting stingy with the meat and portion sizes compared to when they opened. I am disappointed. I liked this place."}
{"text":"I was recently recommended by a friend to come to Pho Vuho while in Oakville and was pleasantly surprised by the variety on the menu! When the dishes arrived, we were blown away by the portion of the dishes for the price point! 

- Fresh grilled pork rolls (#1 on menu) -The fresh spring rolls were very light but flavourful at the same time and balanced well with the fish sauce for dipping. 
- Spring rolls, grilled pork w/ vermicelli - The portion was very large and very filling, I even had some leftover to take home for lunch the next day. 
- Satay beef noodles - This only comes in medium size and I must warn you, if you can't take spice, then maybe this is not the option for you! The broth is served half mixed so that the satay portion sits near the top, I was able to sample the broth before fully mixed and I thought the original beef broth itself was very flavourful. 
- Che 3 Mau (three kinds of beans drink coconut juice) - this is a recommended menu option and after seeing several other customers order it, we decided to give it a try. This was a very refreshing option to end the meal and I would recommend getting this.

Overall a great option if you are in the Oakville area (especially during those cold winter days!)."}
{"text":"Really good vermicelli and pho. Super fresh. The inside of the restaurant looks clean and trendy."}
{"text":"I and my friends went there for dinner. This restaurant was incredibly amazing. I was totally blown away. The food was delicious and the staff was friendly & welcome. I definitely will come back soon. I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who like asian cuisines!"}
{"text":"Yippee!  Another viet resto in Oakville!

They've done a nice job renovating and removing all evidence of the prior Indian and Chinese restos that occupied this spot and the only remnant is the wall / rock water fountain which blends in nicely.  It's been open two weeks and we experienced no grand opening pains as is common with new restos.

We ordered fresh vegetarian rolls and the 201 and 203 pho.  The vegetarian rolls were freshly made and delish.  The pho was fantastic with a generous mound of sprouts, mint, lime wedges, and a chilli pepper for the brave.  The 201 came with a generous portion of beef, tripe and an entire beef ball whereas the other place nearby gives you half a ball.  Don't ask....

Service stands out as they are friendly and the nice touch with placemats, chopsticks in paper envelopes, and spoons brought out for you versus the communal cafeteria approach of a lot of places.

I am definitely coming back.  Pho Vuho has great ambiance, friendly service, great food and excels in all respects compared to Pho Mi 89 up the street at Prince Michael."}
{"text":"Overall: 3/5 
Taking over a spot that was previously occupied by a small Chinese restaurant, Pho Vuho is the newest Pho offering in north Oakville. It's always exciting to have new additions of yummy Vietnamese food to try! Overall, newly opened Pho Vuho wins with a decent array of menu options but still has room for improvement in both taste and service. 

Taste: 3/5
Some great variety in their menu including your standard Vietnamese appetizers (spring rolls, soups), beef noodle soups, vermicelli, assorted rice and noodle dishes. We ended up ordering a small bowl of Pho (medium rare beef with stewed tripe), grilled chicken vermicelli bowl, fresh grilled pork roll, and deep fried ground pork spring rolls. For our starters, both spring roll dishes were decent but nothing to rave about. The pork from the fresh grilled pork rolls must have been house-marinated - interesting taste but a tad salty when paired with the sauce. The ground pork in the deep fried spring roll dish was tasty but fell apart very easily and I ended up having to scoop the contents and eat it separately from the roll :( Onto the Pho...the beef and tripe were SUPER soft, and gave a melt-in-your-mouth type feel (it caught me off guard but in a good way!). Paired with a temperature adequate soup and plentiful noodles, this was a promising bowl of Pho; however, the broth did come up short in that it tasted a little bland. The winner of the night though was the vermicelli bowl. The grilled chicken tasted great - perfectly grilled and flavourful. Portion size was larger than I expected and was probably the most bang for the buck. 

Service: 3/5
We were greeted immediately when we walked in and received attentive service by our designated server the duration of our visit. Our server wasn't super knowledgeable about the menu options but I chalked this up to the restaurant being new. Hopefully they will sound more confident at a next visit! On another note, I did notice other servers wearing flip flops and short shorts while serving other customers. Professionalism-aside, a little concerning at the attire as they could be handling and serving hot foods (piping hot soups!) with room for accidental spills...please be careful! 

Ambience: 3/5
Set-up is quite trendy and overall, gives a fresh, clean look. There is ample seating spaces for patrons. Take-out is available and they offer menus both online and in-store."}
{"text":"Please take out the massive amount of ginger from the congee. It was a total waste of money as we just left the congee in the bowl as we paid. As well, you need to take down those photos on the wall. One kid is a bully at his school. He is sitting next to his dad smiling. Left a very sour taste in our mouths as we recognized who he was."}
{"text":"Amazing little spot for Vietnamese food. We had medium rare beef pho and grilled pork and spring roll on Vermicelli. Both tasted delicious. You can feel owners really put effort into their food as well as the atmosphere. Portion and price are great. Two to three dishes would be enough to feed family of 4. I would totally recommended. 

We need more of these modest and honest restaurants in Oakville, not all the fancy overpriced places which don't even make good food. This place is a jem."}
{"text":"The food is tasteless, service is slow and the restaurant is very small. Nothing to write home about. It's a thumbs down for me!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best pho places in the area. I've been wanting great pho in Oakville for a while now. The house special has everything that you need and they have plenty of options for people who don't like the more adventurous meats. The broth is flavourful and the portions are generous. The staff is friendly and warm. Even on a Tuesday at lunch the place is packed!"}
{"text":"Everything's great except the service. Pho's delicious. Shrimp on sugar cane is interesting. The three bean drink is good too. The service is terrible. Staff's friendly but there's a lot of disorder here. Wrong order, long waiting time and ask to pay before all the food is ready. Anyway, will come back for food but pleeeeeease, improve your operation!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on a Friday. The menu is very extensive and a bit overwhelming! We ordered the fried vegetable spring rolls, the sugar cane shrimp, the chicken tom yum soup and the chicken curry with noodles. Everything was delicious! Fresh and hot (temperature) and oh so comforting! The place is also really cute with tress that hold photos instead of leaves. Will def come back! My o my ask would be a section with non-spicy kid friendly dishes."}
{"text":"Really awesome food. Loved the sea food noodles  bowl. Staff was extremely friendly and guideded me for my ordering. I was surprised to see that this place was all full at 8 pm on a weekday. In one month opening they must be doing something right."}
{"text":"It was just ok. It was my first time trying pho (which I now LOVE), there were too many people coming to our table, one server is enough. They mixed up everyone's orders, and forgot one of them (there were only 5 of us). I felt sick the next morning and I'm pretty sure it was from the food I consumed here."}
{"text":"Great little find!  The food and service was outstanding. The flavor was off the charts!"}
{"text":"I usually go here after grocery shopping at the superstore across the street! The atmosphere is comfy and modern, staff is friendly/easy to communicate with.

Menu is wide, I usually get the beef noodle soup (pho) but the rice dishes are a good choice too!
Well priced and the food comes fast  a good choice for a student like me!
Always a good choice if you want to eat out"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of visiting Hanoi a couple of years back and tried all sorts of pho while I was there...even street pho. I had a bad experience with the street pho. Just because you are in Vietnam doesn't mean that all Vietnamese food is going to be good.

We have lived in Oakville for a couple of decades and have been enjoying pho and Vietnamese cuisine for about that long. When this restaurant launched we were indeed quite excited as good Vietnamese fare on the west end was hard to come by.

The noodles were stale and inedible.

We continue to wait for pho that is palatable."}

It seems like pho is becoming more popular in Oakville! After seeing them enthusiastically waving signs the first day they opened, I had to check them out.

I went to order my usuals: the house special pho (pho dac biet), goi cuon, and an avocado shake. Unfortunately, they didn't have any avocados ready to make a shake with, but they did offer an alternative... fresh passionfruit juice (isn't on the menu)! All I gotta say is that passionfruit was a perfect replacement for the avocado shake. It was sweet with a slight acidity to it. So yummy!

The house special pho was great, the meat given were good cuts and the broth was fantastic. The spices used were subtle and perfectly accented the rest of the noodles. The taste of umami didn't linger on the palate and I was satisfied with the portions. The rolls were great and the grilled pork they used was seasoned and cooked perfectly.

The cost is typical of Vietnamese food around $7-10/entree. The portions were pretty good for me, but for those looking to eat a little more I'm sure the XL bowls should be enough. 

The store is tucked away in the corner making it a little difficult to find, but they made sure to take the space and maximise it. The wall decorations and the layout make it feel a little bigger than it is. 

The service here was very fast and courteous. There were a couple of mix ups, but they were really good with addressing the issues. It might be because some of the staff are pretty new. Once they iron things out, it should be no problem.

I'd like to say this place right now is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Oakville. I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of Pho Vuho. It is a great new option in Oakville. The location is ideal as it is located centrally at Dundas and Trafalgar. The restaurant is in the plaza and you will find it behind Longos. I believe this spot use to be a Chinese restaurant.

We made a visit on a late weekday night with some family and as we went in we got seated pretty quickly. Pho Vuho was almost half full at almost 8:30pm. We were asked if we wanted tea or water and received menus shortly after. The menu item selection is comparable to the other Pho restaurants in the West end. I wanted to either try the bun bo hue or their rice dishes. I opted for the noodle soup since it was a cold night. Our server also recommended the bun bo hue too (and she also said the rice dishes are really good and from what I can see at another table ..It looked real good!).

Everyone else ordered Pho and they seemed to enjoy their noodles. We also tried the shrimp fresh rolls and spring rolls. They were definitely on point and satisfying. My bun bo hue was good and had all the usual items in the rice noodle soup. The only thing to note is that it was slightly missing a flavour and it was lighter in taste. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed my meal and will definitely come back again and try their other yummy looking dishes!

I also have to note that there were a constant flow of tables even though it was late. Glad to see this place doing well! Service is excellent and they do ask for feedback which is always a bonus I'd say!"}
{"text":"Big fan of Vietnamese food, I've tried so many V restaurants. 
As usual I ordered grilled pork and chicken rice as well as durian milk shake for myself. The meat was over burnt and salty, to a point that tasted bitter. And it was dry, not very flavoured. The rice, however, was the best I have had. 
Deep fried spring rolls were good. Durian milk shake was nah. We also ordered beef pho, which was absolutely good. 
So 1 star for the pho, 1 for the spring roll, 1 for the white rice, and 1 for the environment and the service I guess. 
This place is not bad, but I had better Vietnamese food in Mississauga."}
{"text":"I work in the area and there aren't many Vietnamese choices to my knowledge, compared to my home city.

This place is on par in quality and above par in quantity with their Bun. 

I ordered the grilled chicken, shredded pork and spring roll bun. It comes on a bed of salad and vermicelli with a side of sweet vinegar sauce. You must dine in and add their oil concoctions. They have chili and garlic oils that add layers and more variety of flavour.

The decor is clean and welcoming and the service is polite and attentive. They have a big screen TV playing top 40 music videos which was entertaining because I don't usually watch music videos anymore since the 2000s. That Katy Perry, how is she still making money?"}
{"text":"We came in the afternoon and ordered a fish combo and pho (see photos). Both were really delicious! I always order beef pho wherever I go, but I would totally come back and try more of their speciality dishes and rice dishes. Plus the customer service was excellent. 

Highly recommended to pho lovers and Asian dishes lovers."}
{"text":"I love it here!!! Its actually the cleanest/cutest pho place ive ever been to. The service was really good and the food was too! Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"We visited Pho Vuho for the very first time yesterday and it DEFINITELY won't be our last! 

We go out for Vietnamese food 3-4 times a week and have been doing so for 15+ years, so we know our way around a bowl of pho :)

We were greeted and told to have a seat as soon as we walked in the door. The menus and tea were brought over right after we sat down.

Unlike other Viet. restaurants in the area, the waiter came back to write down our order (electronically) rather than being given a slip to fill out ourselves.

We ordered the pork spring rolls, a bowl of pho with tendon and brisket and a bowl of chicken curry soup with vermicelli.

The pork spring rolls were delicious, piping hot and made with rice wrappers just the way we like them. They weren't oily and it was obvious that the oil was fresh. 

The pho broth was very tasty and rich in flavour. There was lots of tendon and brisket and half noodles just as we'd ordered.

The chicken curry soup was really, really tasty. It had a bit of heat and plenty of flavour. There were a few pieces of chicken in it and some potato. It was made with the thick vermicelli (my favourite). The only thing I would have liked was some more greens in it, but that's just me being nitpicky.

The restaurant was very clean and the staff were really friendly and efficient. 

So happy that there's another choice for Vietnamese food in Oakville and a really good one at that!

We will be going back for more VERY soon! Can't wait to give some of their other dishes a try!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars -- Been here 2 times and man, food isn't as good as Pho Mi 89 and service is extremely inconsistent here (and I'm not usually the type of person who dings restaurants for service).

TL;DR Overall, food is mediocre and after 2 visits here, I am thoroughly unimpressed with the food and would rather eat at Pho Mi 89. Sorry, don't know where this 4* is coming from.

Things I've ordered to date: 

My tho seafood *chef's recommendation*: bad, doesn't look ANYTHING like the menu photo which is filled generously with meat. End product had 1 of each thing and lacked stuff from the picture. Bland overall and not very flavourful. Would not recommend to anyone, you're better off ordering pho.

Chicken with 2 eggs rice dish: bf said that the portion size is larger than Pho Mi 89 (it's huge), but the flavouring doesn't compare to the food at Pho Mi 89. He was disappointed to say the least.

Pho: probably the only thing I would order from the menu again. 

Pro tip: an XL can feed 2 people since it's basically 2 small sized pho.

Drinks: TINY in size for what you get. $4.50 for a child sized cup, essentially, which is way too expensive for what it is. Pho Mi 89 offers the drinks in a larger cup + at $3.50 so that's a no for me.

Service on first visit (5*): Phenomenal, they really went out of their way to give awesome service like making sure we had enough cutlery, enough tea, asking if everything was okay, etc.

Service on second visit (1*): Forgot our drink order 3 times. When my bf asked to switch it to a coke since they didn't have 2 drinks available that were listed on the menu, they forgot for 10 minutes. It was also very difficult to communicate with the waitress which I hate to comment on, but it made ordering quite a challenge which shouldn't be the case."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at pho vuho and it was  AMAZING! Prices were decent, service was excellent and the food was the best pho i've ever had !! Would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Working in Oakville on a cold day in spring doesn't have be all bad. Thanks to Pho Vuho with a pretty impressive rating I've decided to drive up there to try it out myself.  I'm always torn between having a bowl of Pho or one of the soup-less vermicelli.  But since this is my 1st Pho experience in Oakville, the rule of thumb say I need to start with Pho.  The service was super quick (yes, I know Pho is almost pretty much cooked in the kitchen) in less than 5 mins of ordering, the Large Pho came.  I want to say the \"Large\" compared to what I'm used to in Toronto/Markham/Richmond Hill is a be smaller, but the ingredients were fresh.  The noodle itself was the slimmer kind and perfectly cooked.  All in all, I'm very happy with the meal, it really hit the spot, and warmed up my belly.  I give 4 overall stars and definitely will be back to try that soup-less vermicelli.

{"text":"I read some good reviews about this place and looked forward to trying it. I was disappointed that the table was dirty, the price was a bit more expensive than other pho places, and the portions were small.  It would be okay if the pho was exceptional but I found the soup quite bland and there was very little meat in the noodle soup."}

We came on a Friday afternoon and was greeted warmly by the server. She was super sweet , friendly and seems to be very productive and quick.  She gave us a few recommendations and we went for the pho and spring rolls and they were delish.  Everything was fast, clean and yummy.  My hubby and I can't wait to go again and try a rice dish maybe.  This place is wonderful and it looks like the other people in the restaurant with us agree. 5 stars plus:)"}
