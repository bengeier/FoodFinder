{"text":"Excellent food - take this from an Indian foodie!! I Tried vegetable Thali - chotey, saag paneer, daal, Raita, hot naan and rice along with chopped onions and pickle"}
{"text":"The food is one of the worst I had in a long time. Curd or yogurt in my papdi chaat was so sour and the potatoes ice cold. I just ended up throwing it off in garbage"}
{"text":"If you select your dishes carefully , you will be in for delight :)
These days I try to get reservations in Riviera to ensure I can eat at this place.
Observations 
-Go with popular choices of combos and snacks rather than ordering dal - combo or Dum Aloo combo. It will be quick and good.
-Tandoori items are a bit dry"}
{"text":"Oh my this place is so good I really love Indian food I know the good stuff  servic was very good friendly chicken tikka masala very good not spicy thanks India masala....."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday with a friend. We had samosas, which were very tasty and original. However, we were very disappointed with the Vegetarian Thali. Only the naan and the raita were good, the chick peas, spinach and the other dish all tasted badly. I had the feeling that it was just warmed up processed food. I am used to better Indian food, even in cheaper restaurants."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place negative stars. Waited OVER an hour for an order of chicken curry. The employees seemed to have no sense of urgency at all. They would stop to fill up water containers even though there were about a dozen people waiting. When we finally got the curry, it was watery and the chicken was dry. Not worth the wait or money. Ill never ever go here again."}
{"text":"YAaaaaaaK place for indian food !!!

Damn expensive , & worst food ever in the entire nation !!!

Spoiling the name & fame of the country !!!

They dont offer a cup of water to their customers & rather guide them to the fountain near the restroom !!!

No star at all"}
{"text":"Simply wow...u won't find better indian food in a fine dining luxury place. This food court joint exceeded expectation with quality, quantity, authentic flavours, n best of all fresh hot food on the vegas strip."}
{"text":"Read the reviews before I went and thought it would be a great experience. But should have paid closer attention to what they really said. 

Had the chicken tikka masala with a mango lassi. The mango lassi was good. The masala was over priced for the quality it was. It is in a food court and should be evaluated as fast food. Not the greatest, but okay when you are hungry and anything will do. Not the best if you are looking for good Indian food. Though the naan was pretty good. The question I had to ask was \"where's the chicken?\"  Too much sauce for the amount of meat. 

So, in the end, the value to quality did not justify the price. But if you get that late night craving for Indian food in the city that never sleeps, this would be an okay stop as they are open 24 hours, but for a great meal of Indian food, find somewhere else."}
{"text":"Chicken tikka masala and butter chicken was nice..and they are open 24 hour very nice food I love indian food .."}
{"text":"Contrary to our expectations, the food here was great.

I was craving for Indian food, and my friend stated lets not go there it has many not-so-great reviews.

I told him not to believe it (yet I am here writing one :)

I played it safe and ordered the idlis (rice cakes)

Normally when the idlis are good, the chutney is bad or the sambar is bad. For all 3 to be excellent, its a feat I have not  experienced anywhere in the world.

Then I ordered samosas to go. Of course, they were pure heaven,

It was so good that my friend and I who were staying at a distant casino started craving for both the idlis & samosas everyday !! We would pack tons of food from there and bring it back.

Kudos to the people who run it (Punjabis I think) for running this awesome place that even is open 24 hours I think (though the late night food is limited)"}
{"text":"Dommage, mais je déconseille fortement ce restaurant. Le repas de la St-Valentin était une fameuse arnaque. Le double du prix habituel, pour une cuisine correct, sans plus."}
{"text":"I regretted not trying out India Masala the last time I was at the Riviera.  An Indian restaurant in a food court?  I didn't really trust it.  But a couple days later I saw it on Yelp with plenty of good reviews.  So when I finally headed back to the Riviera a few months later to check out roller derby, I knew where my dinner stop would be.

The menu is large and has plenty of vegetarian options.  We were starving and not sure how large the servings would be so we went a little crazy; we got an order of saag paneer, vegetable korma, and a masala dosa.  The saag and korma both came with a side of rice and naan, while the dosa came with two chutneys.

The dosa came out first and was HUGE.  I know dosas are large, but I'm pretty sure I could have thrown the thing in Lake Mead and rode it around like a boat.  It was full of potatoes, peas, and lentils and had a nice samosa-taste to it.  I was so hungry that I completely forgot about my chutneys and didn't try them at all.  Boo. 

The saag was good, but lacking a depth of flavor I get at Mint and Origin.  It wasn't bad, but considering the price was the same I'd rather eat at one of those two restaurants.  The vegetable korma was also good but looked a little different from others I've had.  This one was more red in color (instead of yellow) and had a smoky taste to it.  The sides of rice were large and you get a piece of naan the size of your plate.  I love naan, but this one was a little boring for me.  Plus one came out nice and doughy while the other was overcooked and had a crunch to it.

We also ordered a mango lassi and it was undrinkable.  The consistency was too thin and almost tasted like spoiled yogurt.  It went in the trash.

In all, this place is good and I would come back if we were at the Riviera, but the prices are pretty ridiculous to me considering they are in a food court.  Isn't the point of a food court to get cheap grub instead of paying the extra money to sit-down somewhere?  Their appetizers (samosas and such) were about $7 while the dosa was about $8.  I knew the dosa was more food and therefore a better deal so that's why we ordered it instead of an appetizer.  Entrees were around $11 while combo platters were around $13."}
{"text":"Terrible service
Food is bland - no real Indian taste

On the plus side - they are open 24 hours"}
{"text":"Amazing fast food. We got the gobi manchurian; it is delicious! They also have full vegetarian plate. I'm coming back for that next time! The waiter told us they switch out the curries so you will get a different mixture everytime."}
{"text":"Came here to the God court based on the reviews for India Masala.  The food was nothing to write home about. Ordered South Indian and North Indian dishes. Both were OK in taste. The chutneys were definitely frozen (ice cold to touch) and you could see the crystallized ice in them. I give 3 stars since they were quite accommodating of our requirements for no-peanut environment due to severe allergies in one of our guests."}
{"text":"At first we were very excited to have food here because of the great reviews.  VERY DISAPPPOINTED!!!
Food was cold, tasteless and had to wait more than 20 min.
There are better sit down choices, please spend ypur money $$, at a sit down place and get service with the meals!!!
Gave it two star, one star for the convenience and another star since they had a water dispenser on their counter. 
Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Really tasty food. We got the chicken biryani, and the Chicken Masala. They were super delicious, and the chicken was well marinated and spiced."}
{"text":"I can't even give this place a star. Not my first time eating Indian food. I'm from a very heavily populated Indian area back at home with many above standard dining options. This place did not fit the mold in the least. I ordered 2 dishes...Tandoori Chicken and Sheekh Kabob..the Tandoori Chicken was dry, not made to order and cold with a foul odor and taste. the Sheekh Kabob which was questionable as well and was in fact not a kabob. After 3 bites I knew this food was going to end up making me sick due to the fact that it was not fresh but rather food that had been sitting out for hours. The naan was also served cold and not included with our food when buzzed for pickup although it was already paid for. 

The service was worse than the food! When I ordered I received nothing but rude mannerisms from the cashier who failed to do her job efficiently and felt the need to express her frustration with the customers. No matter how polite I tried to be and I'm a very patient person,this cashier continued to be rude. After realizing the food was no good I immediately brought the food back to the counter and demanded a refund. The cashier explained she would need to get the manager..she returned moments later with no manager and stated there was no manager. When I demanded a refund for the full amount paid of $25 dollars she refused and proceeded to call mall security!!! She then moved the tip jar from the counter. I could care less about the tip jar but mall security!!!?!! Security explained I had to fill out a report and make a complaint to the corporate office via guest services. After doing so I have mixed feelings and do not feel I was treated fairly. I will not return to this mall either being that ceases palace is only a hop skip jump away with better shops and food court options. Beware!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible.. we ordered over phone to pick up.. when we came to our Hotel room we were shocked to see BURNT naans.. burnt to the core.. and the parts where is not burnt it is not cooked at all.. how could someone cook like this??  
what a waste of money!!"}
{"text":"Excellent vegan options! The Aloo gabi, vegetable samosas and naan were all great! Full of flavor and a good quantity of food for the price. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"It's a real shame this place is in the nasty old Riviera, because it really is as good as everyone says.

One of the things I hate about every other Indian restaurant I've been to in Vegas is that I always feel like I pay a lot and don't get a lot. Well, not here! The portions are ginormous -- a great value.

And the two dishes we ordered were fabulous. I can't wait to go back and try more! I just wish we didn't have to go to the Riviera to do it!

This would get 5 stars if I didn't have to sit in a nasty food court and eat their yummy food off of a paper plate.

If you can get over that, though...do it! It's worth it I promise."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing!! I was a big fan when they were at the riviera and im super excited about this new location as well....I have to say this location is much nicer and cleaner than the Riviera...but the food is the best part which continues to be transferred over.....we visit vegas for work and this place is our absolute go-to.....they have the best south indian dishes!!! The Masala Dosa is my most fav!!! The staff is friendly and the service is good too.....A must try for anyone who like indian!"}
{"text":"This place was so great! We ate there for 3 days straight while visiting! We had the chicken & veggie samosas, so good! My husband had the fish curry, this was very spicy!!!! We also had some kind of BBQ combo with lentils & a few other items. Then we tried the rice with chicken. I don't remember what it was called but I'm posting a picture. I'd show them the pic & ask for it!"}
{"text":"We went here based on other Yelp reviews but were quite disappointed. To start with, the food court in Riviera is really dirty, dated and stinky - hardly the place you'd want to eat at on the strip with so many better options available. Coming to the food - we ordered veg samosa, veg combo and masala dosa. Masala dosa and samosa were good but the veg combo was a disappointment - the vegetables were way too dry, seemed like reheated instead of cooked fresh and were low on salt. Overall, we will not return here even if we were craving Indian food in Vegas."}
{"text":"The food is really good and always tasty. It's also consistent I've been here a couple of times and they have had a consistent taste. The reason for my 3 star review are the portions, they refused to add an extra meat option. The cashier one time told me she would note it on the ticket since they didn't have it as an option she couldn't charge me for it but she would note in the ticket and see what the cooks say, when I went to get my food I asked the cook and he said yes there's extra but then looked at the cashier with a displeased look in his face and told her next time tell them no. I'm not asking for free I'm willing to pay, the lack of options provided for adding extra has driven me to write this in hopes of they change this."}
{"text":"Nice Indian food at the strip. Variety of options. Veg and Non-Veg Combos are good. 
Best part is , its open round the clock. Breakfast options are good and available from 5 am.

But the queue is long at the peak dinner and lunch times. It is located at Riviera Food
Court."}
{"text":"tasty 24hr food. tried dosai, idli , uthappam, and veg briyani.
everything was good, except idli.

it's little pricey for the amount. but in the strip, it's acceptable.

convenient location, if you walk to this place or take the bus or park in circus circus.
rivera is one of the very old casino's, they still have their dirt from the day opened. including the slowest elevator in their parking."}
{"text":"It is just a fast food joint in a nasty food court that serves their food on styrofoam!"}
{"text":"I'm always picky about Indian food outside India because it's not usually good. And sadly, good Indian food is hard to find in Vegas. But India Masala turned out to be a hidden gem with great food and excellent service. The vindaloo chicken and the lamb kebabs were especially great! Definitely plan to go back on my next Vegas visit."}
{"text":"Their Tandori combo is the Best in Las Vegas tried many Indian restaurant and I keep coming back to India Masala at Riviera hotel is really delicious."}
{"text":"R u tired by roaming on the Strip?
R u Super Hungry?

Go n Order food from here. Order the Chicken Combo and Enjoy all Tandoori Variety of Chicken.

The Taste of food is Awesome."}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat Indian food in las Vegas. The taste is authentic!!! Better than eating the costly buffets in the casinos"}
{"text":"This place is extremely good.  It is the second best Indian resturant in Vegas.  The first being Namaste.   It is not a hole in the wall just in an off strip location.  This is where the locals eat!"}
{"text":"I eat Indian  food today after three day stay in Las Vegas I can't stop to say this is best and wonder full place to eat Indian food . I hop you will try too !!!!!!"}
{"text":"La nourriture est excellente, le service est attentionné et l'ambiance est typiquement indienne. L'essayer c'est l'adopter. Ce restaurant vaut le détour"}
{"text":"I came to las vegas for a quick business trip over the weekend and was looking for some great indian food but i did not have enough time to go to a nice sit down place. THEN I FOUND THIS PLACE in the fashion show mall none the less, best location for any tourist to come. Not only was the food served to me fast but it was so fresh and it tasted amazing. 

I ended up getting the non veg combo platter ( which included chicken tikka masala, chicken curry, rice , naan and some lentils)  since i wanted to try a little bit of everything and i also got a samosa chaat with an ice cold mango lassi. I must say for all this food it was reasonably priced , especially for the location on the strip. 

i will definitely be coming back to india masala on my next trip."}
{"text":"The service it was amazing the food was amazing everything was amazing so happy they open this place at fashion show especially since I switch to vegetarian some times there is plenty of options I will be going back again and again and again"}
{"text":"Great food!  Great $.  Worth the trip.  I know it's in the food court of the Riviera, but don't let that stop you from making the trip to this gem."}
{"text":"Was excellent!!!  Very surprising find for a food court.  The chicken tikka masala was very well done and they made it spicy to my liking.  The chicken was very tender and quite flavorful.  Service was very good and fast - less than 5 minutes to get my order.  Also the dish came with rice and naan bread included!!"}
{"text":"very very good Indian restaurant  in las Vegas blvd ,indiamasala dosa &samber same like chennai taste ,we had wonderful food'  less price, lot of food."}
{"text":"Its located in food court area of Rivera, there r other good indian options on strip. I prefer tamba over this."}
{"text":"Horrible food and worst customer service.Ordered thali it was tasteless and looked like two days old.please do a favor for yourself by not visiting this place."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Vegas!!! 
Always lines of people waiting, but the wait is so worth it!
Its made fresh and trust me you can taste it. 
I dont know what my favorite is, because theres so much. 
MUST TRY !"}
{"text":"Good Indian place in food court. Paneer butter masala and Shahi paneer were awesome. Naan is great. Thali is not recommended, instead go for individual entree which includes rice and naan. Gobi manchurian was disappointing.
This place provides good service."}
{"text":"Why is this place the best Indian food in Vegas? Well... because it is the only Indian food I had in Vegas. By default it wins. 

But it wins in other ways. Its is fracking cheap, relatively speaking of course. The menu is quite huge and it puts the other guys in the food court to shame. 

The service is pretty good and the wait time is decent considering the queue of customers and staff on hand.

The food itself is a little heavy, which is to be expected, but otherwise really really really good. 

It was soo good that I had to have it twice during my weekend stay in town. If I ever find myself wishing I wasn't in the Riviera casino, I know I'll be swinging by here to kill time as well as my time."}
{"text":"We happened  to eat  here while on vacation which offers good Indian food although little expensive , we stayed in Trump International which is just opposite to the mall entrance . 
I ate lunch combo or thali on one day and masala dosa on the next both tasted good enough ,we even tasted biryani which is fair enough but not authentic .We hadn't had quite a chance to dine in other Indian restaurants , so I could not conclude whether it is the best Indian food or not but a good place to eat in when really hungry n craving Indian food ."}
{"text":"I am quiet sure that people who gave 5 stars were either under the influence of something or never had decent Indian food. This place is just OK. Nothing great to write about. The food is nothing that will make me go here again, but if I am in the Riviera hotel and hungry, I might try. Chances are it won't happen as the hotel and people around are extremely shady, especially, after 7 PM. Nothing to say too much about ambiance, as I knew well that it is a food court, but didn't expected the food court to be so dirty where you step over empty bags of chips and kick around paper cups."}
{"text":"Best Dosa place in Town... Good thing is Fashion Show mall and prices are very Affordable."}
{"text":"I was so relieved to find out that India's Masala had finally reopened. It used to be in the Riviera food court (the only reason to even go to the sad Riviera), but since its closing, they have finally reopened in the food court of Fashion Show mall. Being new, the little stall is much nicer than their space at the Riviera, with more attractive design. I have to admit, the only thing I ever get is the masala dosa. South Indian food is hard to find in the U.S., so whenever I do find it I am excited. Their dosa is very good, not the best I've had, but much better than you'd expect from a food court.  I also get the mango lassi, which is excellent. I haven't tried the curries yet. Someone else at the counter was picking up naan on my last visit and it looked buttery delicious. I will have to try it on my next visit. Just so glad they've reopened!"}
{"text":"Good food. I ate there everyday while I was in vegas. The only downside is the service staff. Once there was no one to take the order for 20 min even when there was no line. Another time their credit card machine was down so I had to go and get cash from the atm. But the food more than makes up for the bad service.  The problem I think is that the place is heavily under staffed."}
{"text":"2 and 1/2 star actually.

This was the first Indian meal of the long trip we had planned.  It took a little while for us to figure out that this restaurant was in the food court of Fashion. The Gobi Manchuria could have been better. We had ordered the Veggie Thali and it was ok. Dosa was ok as well."}
{"text":"We came at 8:40 and they say they are closing and only have limited menu. We walked all the way to get disappointed."}
{"text":"We used to visit this place when it was in riviera. It was one of our fav then. However they moved to fashion show mall and we visit there again but this time it was okay experience. We order samosa, medu vada and dosa. Samosas and medu vada was surely not fresh, felt it was refried and old from last day. Dosa was good though. Also the price have gone up."}
{"text":"First off, I have to tell you that I'm Indian, so I'm probably going to be a little more critical of this place than most others.  I paid $15 for the vegetarian thali, which was pretty expensive for food that comes in a Styrofoam plate from a restaurant in a food court.  The food at this restaurant is the kind of stuff that they probably cook once a day all in one batch, and then serve throughout the day.  Unfortunately, if you go there at 2 AM like I did, the food they serve you might be a little stale from sitting out all day.  
I've eaten here twice because I feel sorry for these people who don't seem to get very many customers, but I don't think I'll eat here again.  The food just isn't good, and the prices are way too high."}
{"text":"This is one of the few vegetarian options in the Fashion Show Mall food court, and it's super tasty! I had palak paneer. It was well-seasoned, a tiny bit spicy, with generous chunks of paneer and served with nice, airy long-grain rice and a piece of tasty buttered naan. There is even a vegan option on the menu, the aloo gobi (cauliflower and potato dry curry). The service was friendly and efficient. Tip -- if you want water, ask them for the sparkling water / club soda from their soda fountain (which they provide for free) rather than filling your cup from the water fountain around the corner."}
{"text":"I love this place! I loved them at the Riviera and I'm so happy they set up here at Fashion Show Mall. Seriously, THE BEST Indian food in Las Vegas! Never disappointed with chicken biriyani. I used to love the Goa chicken curry as well."}
{"text":"Good Indian place on the strip. Tasty food.     Decent service. It's in the food court in the mall. Use the escalators in front of Wynn and go up to the third level. When we used google maps it took us to the mall entrance and from there it's a long walk!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. We went with some friends that were visiting from out of town, and they loved it so much that we went twice in 3 days.The best thing about this place is that the food is fresh and tasty and very close to homemade food.
The masala dosa is crisp and yummy(infact we had many people looking curiously at what this food was). The veg dishes including palak paneer come with a naan and rice. Our friends tried the tandoori combo which was very good as well as the fish curry and goa chicken.
The ambience is ok but the food is really good."}
{"text":"Service is very slow and food is not that great. But its an oasis for the people looking for indian food in the strip. We have tried masala dosa and its decent and better than many places I have tried in US but biryani is awful. I think it may please americans who like non spicy food but definitely not Indians. Biryani has that typical taste where they cook everything separately and just mix it for the customers when ordered. Its quite expensive too!"}
{"text":"Nice food , quick service and ideal location . Worth trying Indian food here . Deducted one star as it seemed little pricey ."}
{"text":"Best indian food in vegas. 24 hrs open. Best dosa i ever had. 
North indian food is good too. Must visit."}
{"text":"Me and my friend were shopping in fashion show mall in the strip LV and  surprisingly found an Indian restaurant fast food type in the food court.. Everything we ordered tasted good and the service was super fast even when it was busy when we ordered. Prices were cheaper than many other indian eateries. Will definitely recommend if ur craving for some south indian fast foods type food."}
{"text":"Terrible food, too much salt in the dishes. Nothing is mild, everything we ate was chili pepper spicy. I know indian food is spicy, but the dishes here were unbearable."}
{"text":"This place is located in the food court of the Riviera. I ordered the chicken tikka masala & mango lassi. The mango lassi was great & I would definitely order it again, but the chicken tikka masala was more bland than that of any other place I have ever tried! The naan was humongous and pretty good, but not enough for me to come back here in the future.

I probably won't be back here -- even though I really enjoyed the mango lassi-- just because it's in a weird location. It was like walking through a maze just to get to the food court (as I was leaving, I heard guests complaining about the same thing).. but I'm assuming the food court is more geared towards tourists as it does have an opening facing Las Vegas Blvd."}
{"text":"I never thought I would get sick of prime rib and crab legs, but after 2 days of buffet food, I just needed something with a little punch. Luckily, this place wasn't too far down the strip and located in the same location where our show was, so I was really looking forward to some flavorful food. The store is located in a rather ratty looking food court with carpeting...ick. It is clearly the most popular stall in the place with, I think, every Indian person in the area waiting on line. Just to order your food can take some time and, then, depending on the order, can take about 30 min to actually get the food. 

The food itself was decent. We got chicken vindaloo, chole bature and mango lassi. The portions were all generous enough to feed two very hungry people. The chicken vindaloo was very nice and spicy, but used entirely too much tomato. The chole bature was spot on. The bature was obviously made fresh and a great balance of crispy and soft. The chole was a little stale tasting but still delicious. I particularly enjoyed the mango lassi. It was nice and thick with strong mango flavor. This place is open 24 hours a day so your Indian food craving can be satisfied at any time. The prices are cheap for Vegas, but as a Central Jerseyite, I'm used to better bang for my buck. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"This place is a modest great place to eat some quick indian food. Very tasty, very reasonaable. Their aloo tikki chat is one of my fav. My only prob with them is their limited menu and their south indian isn't all that great. All said I liked eating there for my stay there. So 4 out of 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"I cant stand indian food, sorry its just not my cup of tea. But my wife kinda likes it and wanted to try it here. The food court here in the Riviera is literally a ghost town, I cant comprehend how all the eateries stay in business. She ordered a non veg plate that came on a little prison plate with tiny little compartments of food and a big piece of bread. She said it all tasted pretty good and she easily finished it all, and she doesnt  have a big appetitie. The cost w/o drink was over $16! which is outrageous for food court food during lunch. I know this is vegas and eveything is overpriced a bit, but every other eatery had equal sized portions for half the cost, Plus my wife got really sick after eating it,"}
{"text":"Great Indian food.  Tried four different dishes during my stay in Las Vegas and all were flavorful, well prepared and reasonably priced for the Strip.

Try the Malia Kofta -- you'll love it.

I still amazed at how good the food at India Masala was."}
{"text":"I decided to give them a try while we were in vegas recently. i ordered chicken tandoori that comes with rice and a side of garlic naan. When my food arrived, I found the chicken to be not cooked enough so I sent them back to the girl at the counter and told her that there were still some reddish colour in the middle of the chicken pieces. To my surprise she asked, \"do you them well done?\". I'm not sure if she was just surprised that I asked the chicken to be cooked more or if she was really serious. I shall give her the benefit of the doubt! lol. Anyways, about 15min later she signaled that my food is ready (again) so I went to the cashier and was told that the cook decided to make me a new order altogether and this time the chicken were thoroughly cooked."}
{"text":"One of the worst ever places. Being in Vegas for a week made me crave for indian and found this small place. Ordered the food  to eat there and my friend and I were sitting in the food court in the meantime. Went back 10 mins later and the guy had packed our food in a to go. I asked him to serve us in plates so we could eat. He gave us plates and said we kept calling ur number and u didn't show up so we packed it. 10 mins really?? He gave me a flimsy disposable plate hard to hold the curry and food. Asked him for a stronger one and he refused. He kept insisting that they don't give plates for to go orders and I kept telling him that I ordered to eat there. Finally on my face he said he won't give me anything and I should leave. All this rudeness and attitude for disposable plates?? Clearly if I wasn't super hungry I would have thrown the whole order on his face. They don't care as 90% ppl visiting them are tourists. What a shame."}
{"text":"As an employee of fashion show mall~ it's awesome that this location offers a mall employee discount on my order!  Also, every time I order lunch from here I always get the best service from Monica!

She takes the time to explain the dishes if I have questions about ingredients, or how they're prepared.  I also saw her give exemplary customer service to a customer who was being less than polite to her in front of me in line. 

The selection of dishes are bountiful and I have yet to try more of the delicious looking menu.  Looking forward to trying them all!   If you're in the mall and looking for something fresh, hot and delicious- give India Masala a try!"}
{"text":"Really good food, It is in the food court of fashion show mall. We had chicken madras curry,Chloe bhatura( garbanzo beans with puffy bread) a must try, mango lassi. Portions are large. If you are in vegas you must try this place or if you are local I am sure you will get hooked to their food. I recently moved here and I go there almost every weekend. Prices are fair. Customer service is awesome as well. They will answer all your questions. Btw they have this South Indian corner in their menu, every item is a must try.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"For an Indian fast food place, they have done a very good job with providing freshly cooked delicious options. 

They are located in a food court so there is not much they can do about the plates and tables and everything else. They nailed it with their delicious food. We had ordered two items from very different parts of India and they both turned out to be very good. 

I would have placed this my top recommendation on the strip for Indian food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I checked in to the hotel around 2 am and we were hungry. Since it's the only 24/7 fast food place in the hotel we got food from here. We got the Chicken Tikka Masala. We got up to our room and the room and began eating and the chicken was cold. The sauce was warm but the the chicken wasn't warm at all. So my boyfriend called down to tell the restaurant our food was cold and the person that took our order said we took to long and hung up in his face. I called back and ask if the manager was in. He said no, so I asked for his name and he gave me a fake name. So the next day my boyfriend went down to talk to the manager and they gave him another meal free. For fast food indian food it had a pretty good taste but some of their workers are unprofessional."}
{"text":"I have been staring at the sign for 3 years and finally decided to try this. Honestly I was in there for Parsley which isnt open yet. However, decided on trying this place out. Had the Tandoori Sampler. Was overcooked meat mostly and had the total buffet taste going on. No made to order and was not impressed. Nan was highlight but wouldnt repeat."}
{"text":"Very authentic and delicious Indian food ! Madras curry was stunning. Very courteous folks and quick in delivery.

Thank you ! We enjoyed.

{"text":"Good India food with a fast food concept. Its located inside the Riviera Hotel and was the only good option for lunch. The food tastes good and is reasonably priced for Vegas. The quantity deserves a special mention too. Stop by for a quick tasty bite."}
{"text":"After a grueling day of shooting pool in the Southwest Challenge, I was pleased to find that the food court at the Riviera had an INDIAN RESTAURANT. At first, I thought I was hallucinating, but once the smell of the shahi paneer and garlic naan that I ordered hit my nose, I realized that this blissful little moment was actually taking place. The staff was friendly, excited even, over my obvious enthusiasm. I came back the next day and had the malai kofta, also excellent.  When I return for the National APA Team Championship in August, I will definitely be at India Masala!"}
{"text":"visited vegas during christmas and spotted this place. very decent food and portion size in the prices. 
Tried 2-3 different vegetarian options, north indian food was good, but south indian was disappointing (we tried medhu vada and sambhar). 
we ordered only north indian when we revisited
Loved their mango lassi
Entire food court was super crowded and this place had huge queue before we could order. But that did not stop us from revisiting this place"}
{"text":"Had the goat biriyani for $15 but serving size was HUGE.  Tasted good and had nice flavor; my only complaint would be that the bay leaf was in pieces scattered throughout which I had to keep spitting out. Raita on the side was good; however I wish it was just a tad colder since I'm a pansy when it comes to spicy foods in general.  
Ordered a side of naan which came out toasty, warm and fresh.  

Overall, good authentic food for a relatively low price."}
{"text":"I have been a big fan of this family owned spot since the were at Rivera Casino (now closed). They have really amazing Indian food, affordable and variety of choices. They are supper friendly and your food will be ready real fast. Now at their new location in Fashion Show mall, they continue their great service in the open good court area. If you're in Vegas and you're craving for some good, flavorful and afford Indian, you should check out India Masala, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent!  The veggie Samosas were spot on... Big.. Crispy on the outside... nice potatoes and spices on the in.  Butter Chicken was nice.. A little tart... aromatic.. Sweet.. Chicken moist.  Very nice dish.  The portions are huge.  Naan bread is cooked perfectly... Crisp..soft..chewy."}
{"text":"Nice food. I loved the taste. Reducing one star for the timings which I guess has to do with Mall but common guys its Vegas and we need it 24x7 specially over weekends. 
Also , the Chai is amazing at this place."}
{"text":"Food was really good I tried the #7 one I wish the serving is more more RICE please lol anyways an then my friend got the number #12 it's really good too price is decent and the order came fast"}
{"text":"I had their vegetarian combo two days in a row. It did taste really good. It was spicy enough for me. I wouldn't mind even if it was a bit more spicy. (I love spicy food.) The only downside was they had almost the same item in the combo on both days except one dish. The naan was too thin and a bit crisp for my taste. I also tasted dosa which was really good. I would love to come back to this place next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very good Indian food, highly recommended than other options on the strip. Though located in a food court within Riviera Casino, the food is tasty and worth the buck. Best dish was Shahi Paneer. It was desi dhaba style, enough quantity for both me and my wife. Their Naan's were nice and crispy. South Indian food was decent, nothing good or bad about it. For the few days we stayed on the strip, we went here couple of times and it was worth it. Service was quick and good. I think the location makes this place a little less popular and unknown to the crowd. If you have a car or any other means to get here, I think its totally worth it though. You can avoid the crowds and have some nice Indian food here."}
{"text":"I love eating Indian food but at a food court is not the place for it.  The guy who took my order was very nice and answered all the questions I had.  The atmosphere was representative of a food court was you order your food wait for it and find your own seat.  The food here was satisfactory.  . We ordered the tandoori chicken, butter chicken, and chicken biryani.  The tandoori chicken was great and it came with naan.  The naan was hot and fresh.  The butter chicken was similar to chicken tikka masala.  I am pretty that is what was given to us.  The biryani was good with a different spice to it. They also have a location on Flamingo that is really enjoyable.  It is a sit down restaurant where they take your order and bring your food to the table.  They have more options on food including lamb and other meats.  The atmosphere there is more pleasant.  This location is moving to the fashion show mall since the Riviera hotel is closing."}
{"text":"(I think I'm being trolled by one of the workers lol after my Yelp review) 
15$ all I got was sauce. Barley had any chicken. It was tasty but not worth the price. They don't even give out ice water. Would I eat here again? probably not. Would I recommend it. Only if they were vegetarians and had money to waste. This place isn't bad but I been to other restaurant on the strip if I were to recommend one, it would be Bombay Indian Cuisine for the same price you can get a buffet and your money worth."}
{"text":"Found this place around midnight on a saturday. There was only one guy working there, so my chicken curry and samosas order took about 25 minutes. WELL worth the wait. Cost about 20 bucks but was plenty for 2 people. This was by far the best curry I have had in the states, let alone Vegas. It beat out all other fancy Indian joints by far. Only thing it was a notch too spicy for me. And I LOVE hot food. I highly recomend this diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"One of the worst on the strip. Don't even dare to try this restaurant. Their cook doesn't know a bit of cooking Chicken tikka."}
{"text":"I was craving some Indian food and decided to try this place at fashion show mall. I have to say not for just a fast food but compared to all other places I've tried in town this was the most authentic and tastiest. We decided to try the tandoori chicken, masala dosa, Chole bhature, and chicken madras curry and we just couldn't decided which was better! Everything is amazing and the service was equally good. Rahul the cashier suggest all the dishes and I'm glad we listened to him. Thanks Rahul for your great recommendations!"}
{"text":"This place is extremely overpriced for a small take out place in a dirty little corner of the riviera casino.
The place is very shabby, and no one would ever want to sit and dine here.
The portions are really really small for the price they charge.
The plates in which they give the food out are made of very thin paper and all the gravy of my curry was sunk into it.
Trust me no one would ever want to dine here if there was a choice."}
{"text":"Had dinner two times in this place during my recent trip to LV, and the experience was really good, but it is a little costly if you try comparing it with the restaurants in Sunnyvale (CA) :)

Ordered the below items -
i. Chicken Kadhai (served with rice and naan) - Too spicy, but tasty :)
ii. Tandoori Combo ( served with one naan) - Different tandoori items to try, and it was tasty too.
iii. Chicken Curry (served with rice and naan) - Average chicken, but was good.

Overall I would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Trying this place for the first time and didn't expect this place to be this good! The food was awesome!! I ordered chicken tikka masala and it's really delicious, it's not to overwhelming with the Indian spices, it's just the right amount of it. If I come back to Las Vegas, I'll definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"They have most amazing Naan I have ever had in US. Food quality was awesome. Price wise, they aren't bad. It is way better than Bombay Indian cuisine next door where we wasted $30 for nothing. 

We were staying at Riviera and looking for Indian restaurants near by. We got 10% off as we were staying at the Hotel. Every morning we start with Tea and some light lunch. They had North Indian and South Indian dishes. Quality and quantity wise this is the best. Only thing is, they don't have buffet. I am taking one star off because of that. But I love to visit them again whenever I there. Don't forget to order Naan if you go there..very soft.  Hope it helps."}
{"text":"The food might take a while to come out. Just expect it, then it won't be as painful.

I went here based on the reviews here. I was suspicious first but I decided to give a shot since I was staying at Riviera hotel anyway and was too tired to go far for food yesterday.

It turned out, the place was awesome. I ordered my usual for Indian food, Chicken Tikka Masara, to go. It came with rice and a huge naan. Plenty for one person.  I was so full 2/3 of the container but I hated to see the rest go wasted so powered through to finish the whole thing (I didn't have a microwave to warm it up next day so saving leftover wasn't an option). It was that good.  Mango Lassi was also delicious too. Perfect consistency and not too sweet.

I give 4 stars because I think the price is a bit steep for a food-court. If you make it to go, remember to grab silverwares and napkins. They are a food-court joint after all so they don't put those gears in a bag for you, you need to grab them yourself."}
{"text":"This food stinks and the service is worse than that. I don't even know where to start. All the food was cold and what really ticked me off is they don't serve water when you order. Not a fucking cup of water ?!?! Are you serious? This is Las Vegas first of all and second of all after spending 60+ dollars at your restaurant you can't give me a fucking cup of water? Smh I don't even want to continue writing or it'll be bad.


03/08/2016 
I'm back here for dinner with my family. Decided to give another try. And bunch of sh** still don't offer water. Bought 50$ worth of food asked for water and they say \"here is a cup there's a water fountain by the bathroom\" freaking a-holes. I won't be giving my business to people like this ever again. \"Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me.\"  Villa pizza right next door gave me 5 cups of nice iced water with no hesitation. On top of that you can tell the food is old and its served cold. The sauces taste like the frozen ready to eat sauces you can get at any Indian market. Learn how to run your business. Sorry not sorry."}
{"text":"Located inside the Fashion Show's Food Court, this is one of few places where you can eat Indian while on strip. I was visiting with family and all they eat is Indian so we had to come here daily. We ordered the veg thali both times and it came out okay with 1 naan, rice, 3 veg dishes (paneer, daal, chole). Chole bathure also were decent. It's a self serve joint in the mall so I didn't have much expectations to begin with. Overall, if you are on the LV strip craving Indian...go here."}
{"text":"Landed in Vegas a few days ago and what do I first.. pull out and Yelp the various ethnic eateries in the area.   For Indian, India Masala surfaced quickly as one of the better, closer, more economical and walking options. 

Early one morning I decided to walk down the strip to find this place which is in the small mall / eatery at the Riviera.   I then I returned a couple of days later for dinner.  Yes, it is lanky food court.  Yes it shares a kitchen with a burger joint.  Yes, your food will be served on paper plates, a tray and plastic utensils.  Yes, the food court looks like it is 40 years old and in dire need of repair (a common theme in some parts of Vegas)  but... get past that and you will be rewarded with some nice, well prepared, flavorable and generous food which is NOT at the normal Vegas strip price only a few blocks back. 

I ordered Dal Maharani which came with a large side of Naan and not just a few pieces - the entire portion.  It was nicely cooked and not too oily.   The dish was well prepared, with a wonderful smooth flavoring.  

I also opted to get a Mango Lassi which was cool and refreshing from this Vegas scorching heat and a favorite when I do Indian.   

Give these guys a a try the next time you hit Vegas and want quick, inexpensive Indian."}
{"text":"Oh my. This place is SO GOOD!

I really love Indian food...so on a recent trip to Vegas, we searched for a cheap Indian place nearby. We came across India Masala, which oddly, was located in a food court inside the Riviera. It was a little difficult to find it inside, but I am very glad we did.

The wait wasn't as long as other reviewers stated. About average. Not that I care as long as I get my delicious food. I had the butter chicken twice during our weekend visit. It was just that good! 

They price is not that bad. In comparison to those crazy inexpensive Indian lunch buffets, yes, it's a bit more...but trust me, the portion sizes are really generous and the flavor is much, much more delicious.

Ah...can't wait to have their butter chicken on my next trip to Vegas :D"}
{"text":"We found this place at the Riviera and I have to say it exceeded our expectations.  Just walking thru the food court and smelling the spices made me salivate.  I have to say some of the best indian food I have had.  I had the Masala Dosa and I have to say this is one of the best Dosa I have ever had.  We  have a few restaurants in our city that have Dosa but it does not measure up to the dosa here.  It was huge with lots of filling and the sambar soup served with it was spicy but not too spicy.  I have not been to Vegas since May and every time I think of the dosa here I start to drool.  My boyfriend had the Tandori combo and he said it was extremely good.   I cannot wait to go back again.  We have had Tamba before and while it is good and they offer Goat my boyfriends favorite for basic indian food you cannot beat this place.  I cant wait until my next trip to Vegas just to have another masala dosa from here and if they serve them at 2am on the late night menu dont be surprized to find me there."}
{"text":"One of the best and always accessible restaurants that is in LV strip and close to authentic taste of  indian food.

I would visit this place again..."}
{"text":"Based on the looks and location of this place, you would never guess how good it is.  I went there with two relatives who were visiting from southern India and we all loved the food!  The dishes were deliciously authentic and the portions were very generous.  The tandoori chicken plate we ordered was cooked to perfection.  I also recommend the masala dosa.  It's a great little gem that I can't wait to go back to next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Bad food:( we ordered a plain dosa and veggie combo - the plain dosa was hot came with sambhar and chutneys - sambhar had no salt and was watery,chutneys were watery and cold, I think made few days ago. Veggie combo - had rice, naan, chole, palak paneer, curd and dal. The palak paneer hardly had any paneer - and was firm, chole dal - salt less. Curd - was thin and sour, I think made up few days ago. Not worth the money. 
Just a temporary way to kill hunger. 
Review by an Indian!"}
{"text":"Who knew a place this great would actually be inside of Riviera Casino's food court?!  For those who've been to its other location on Flamingo near UNLV, this isn't as aesthetically pleasing.  However, something about the griminess of the surrounding area made the experience that much better.  In fact, I prefer this one as it somewhat feels more authentic.  Unfortunately, it doesn't have an all you can eat lunch special unlike the restaurant; but hey, it's open 24/7 so I guess I just found a new joint to hit up after a long night of debauchery!!

I find it quite amazing how a fast food stall in a food court can offer such impressive array of dishes that most Indian restaurants don't.  In this case, the menu comprises of northern and southern Indian specialties--some of which I've never even heard of before--thus it'll definitely take several visits to try every single food from this place.  I thoroughly enjoyed their vegetable samosa especially with the tamarind chutney.  Another great choice is their tandoori combo which includes tandoori chicken, garlic chicken, chicken tikka, and chicken sheesh kabab with a side of saag paneer and naan.

TIP: Park at the lot next to Peppermill and enter from the front entrance to avoid the long, confusing walk through the old casino floor.

Overall, India Masala is definitely a great spot for Indian food any time of day.  It's right what they say that some of the greatest things out there are found on the most unexpected places.  In this case, you just have to surpass the idea that this is situated inside a rundown food court.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Came to this place on wimp as we wanted to eat Indian while we were on the strip. This isn't a sit down place its located inside the fashion mall next to zara in the food court. We ordered papdi chaat, chole bhatura, thali and mysore masala dosa. Chole bhatura was decent so was the thali but Mysore masala dosa wasn't cooked properly or even crispy but the sambar was good. Papdi chaat was ok since the papdi wasn't big enough it felt more like they had fried tortillas and cut it into small pieces. It wasn't bad for LV and decent if you just want to grab and go. It was a little pricey so I would recommend going to a traditional Indian place as it would be cheaper to get buffet than ordering 5 different dishes."}
{"text":"I have eaten a decent amount of Indian food in my life and their Chana Masala is on par with many really good Indian restaurants. The Naan was also very fresh and delicious. When I visit Las Vegas next I will come back again."}
{"text":"Only if u cant live without indian food go for this place... waste of money if u r here for craving dosa or other indian food... 2 star for just having the shop in malls.. thnx for that.."}
{"text":"For an Indian place in a food mall, this place is fantastic!!!!
Worth the wait for your food. 
Best Indian I've had in a while. Spicy and flavorful. 
So good!"}
{"text":"The downside is that this is a relatively simple place for Indian food. Seriously, what can you expect from a food court of this size? Everything is authentic and aimed in the right direction, but at the same time everything falls just a hair short of what it likely would be if it were a standard restaurant. To their credit, they have a reduced menu even through the middle of the night. It's a blessing if you're stuck in the Riviera at 2 am and nobody wants to walk down the strip.

It's not the kind of place to go out of your way for, but if you wind up stuck at the Riviera or Circus Circus and need to fill up in the middle of the night, it's one of your best picks."}
{"text":"Very good options and tasty food. I have tried them for the first time and I love it. Only place I found to have south Indian food without BUFFET.

I am definitely going there again and did I mention its 24/7 :D"}
{"text":"Easily some the best Naan you'll ever taste. 

It's too bad that not many folks will ever find this gem in its hidden location in the Riviera. The Riviera food court has absolutely no ambience, but if you like Indian the food is very good."}
{"text":"I'm a local and live in summerlin. My boyfriend and I drive across town just for the food at India masala inside the Fashion Show Mall. We pass at least a dozen Indian food places on the way. Chicken korma is a must try. As well as the chicken biyriani! Great food and fast service. If your looking for great Indian food. You must stop by here!!"}
{"text":"If it came down to nothing but taste, I would give India Masala five stars. 

\"Shari. It's in a food court. At the Riviera. Sharing a kitchen with a burger joint.\"

I know, I know, I know, but you know what? It's not only some of the best Indian food I've had in Las Vegas (and as far as I know, I've left no tandoor untouched), but it's the kind that tastes even better the next day, just like homemade. Order big - you'll be glad of the leftovers later.

After a delicious first meal there back in the spring of 2010, we'd speak longingly of returning, but every time we'd think about parking, think about navigating the Riviera, and then think about sitting in a food court that, while clean, is still an old food court in an old casino, and we'd end up somewhere else, somewhere with waiters and easy parking.

But then one day we had a coupon for a meal elsewhere in the Riviera and, alas, the meal was pretty bad. So bad that we decided to push our plates aside and walk across the casino to get some India Masala to take home with us.

After that, no more excuses. We have this down pat: if I drop off my husband by the front door. (The food court is right through the southern front door opening onto the Strip.) Then I circle around a few times, pick up him and his Enormous Bag of Fragrant Wonders, and within 20 minutes (15 if the traffic is right), we're back home and laying out a delicious Indian feast on our dining room table. 

Mike always gets the chicken tikka masala, which he described as perfectly spiced with good-quality ingredients. (You can read his review here, too, but I think he was too pleased with the taste and surprised at such a find to take the time for much description.)

We both like the naan - it's enormous and fluffy. I almost always get the shahi paneer - creamy, spicy sauce with cheese - made at about a 7/10 per my request. (If your server doesn't ask how hot you want it, let them know. That's true of any Indian restaurant. Otherwise, if you like spicy food, you risk them playing it safe.) 

Unfortunately, shahi paneer isn't on the late-night menu. That's a shame, as I can personally account to some lost 1 a.m. sales during summer break. 

In fact, I was going to take off a star for this and also because it's in a food court, but that's really unfair. If we stick to food court expectations, this is a 7 out of 5. The flavours are as layered and subtle as anywhere else in town, at least for what we order. (In fact, the only place that makes a better shahi paneer, in my opinion, is a weird dive on the east side with rotten service, so this is really my top option.) Service has always been friendly. And although the late night menu is smaller and more expensive, the regular menu is available until 10 p.m., the same as most restaurants. 

So, yes, the ambience is severely lacking, but you know what? India Masala transcends its location. I started this review regretting that I couldn't give it five stars, but that's just nonsense. This is wonderful food, served by dependable and polite people, and it tastes and looks great when I bring it home. FIVE STARS!"}
{"text":"I love Indian food and found this place that has good butter chicken and naan. Finished the meal with a mango lassi."}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious. I had not decided to heat indian food but it was late and did not had good options. So ended up here. Food was awesome and never expected from a food court indian restaurant. Its little bit pricey but the quantity is accordingly. Its open 24 hrs which is an addition."}
{"text":"If there's a no star, that's what I would give this place. The only good thing about this place is they're open 24 hours. 

Ordered chicken tendoori chicken and chicken sheesh kabob. Tandoori chicken was OK. I asked if I could exchange the nann that comes with chicken sheesh kabob with rice. And they said no. Chicken sheesh kabob was extremely hot with pepper and the spice smells very strong that I couldn't eat at all. 

Then there's a sign at the cash register that there's a $0.50 charge for a payment if less than $8.00. When I used my credit card to pay for the order of $27+ with my card, they swiped the card and said there's $1.00 fees for using credit card after swiping my card. 

The two guys working for overnight shift there were extremely rude. I would rather go to IHOP and get a better service."}
{"text":"Love this spot. Best Indian Food in Las Vegas. I am addicted to the paneer butter masala and am here at least once a week. Monica always remembers my order and gives me lovely service!"}
{"text":"Yum. Went here with Misti Y last night before the Roller Derby event and was really impressed. Their naan (included with entree) comes out big, savory and soft with lots of air pockets, and the chef's recommendation of 'medium-hot' spice for my entree was pretty perfect. I got the Chicken Tikka Masala, and look forward to trying the Vegetable Korma next time. 

While waiting for my order, I wandered down the food court to check out the other vendors and happened upon the India Masala / Gaylord India mini-truck parked outside - I had no idea that the Rio Hotel's Gaylord India restaurant was related to this food court satellite. Makes me want to try Gaylord India as well. And, while we were waiting we ran into a cool Elite Yelper couple that Misti had never met in person. 

India Masala is open late (past 1AM) and curiously the late night menu is smaller but more expensive by $1-$2. I guess they kind of have a monopoly on masala after 10PM on the Strip.

4.5 stars (If my dish were $8 or $9 instead of $12, I would give India Masala 5 stars in a heartbeat.) My current late-night fix has been 10PM happy hour sushi. If we can figure out how to park close to the India Masala mini-truck I think this could be a solid afterparty spot, joining the likes of Soyo, Herbs & Rye, Satay, Slidin' Thru HQ and Bazic..."}
{"text":"The India Masala in fashionshow mall food court has some of the best Indian food in las vegas.  I am a local and brave the traffic and tourists just to eat here.  With my love of trying new things this place has a large variety.  One of my favorite parts to coming here is the great courtesy that meets me at the counter.  Her name is Monica and her smile a great attitude keeps me coming back.  Give it a try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my second time at this place. Amazing food, full of spices. Goat biryani is a must to have. In vegas if you have a craving for indian food, this is a must go."}
{"text":"Had the spicy Chicken Madras, which was basically a curry dish, served with rice and naan.  Also ordered a side of the yogurt sauce.  Portions are huge.  Food was really good.  I had been craving Indian.  This scratched an itch."}
{"text":"Amazing taste and real quick service. We took chhola bhatura and veg thali. Both were good. Bhaturas were so soft and yummy. They also give lemon, onions , pickle and green chillies with food which is the icing on the cake!"}
{"text":"Meilleur resto indien de la région. Propriétaire attentionné. Vous demandez au serveur de choisir pour vous en lui spécifiant vos goûts et il ne se trompe pas."}
{"text":"This is fast food Indian food located in the mall food court, but it doesn't taste like fast food. There's a wide variety of menu options to choose from, but I stuck with my old standby, chicken korma. It was about a pint of chicken korma with rice and naan as well. The heat level was just right. Definitely check this place out. The food was good and the price was right :)"}
{"text":"Best naans ever with spicy indiuan food, just at the strip. Must visit place for casual lunch/dinner in the food court."}
{"text":"We visited this place for the first time and food is really awesome..the best in Vegas..!!"}
{"text":"I got the tikka masala it was good had just the right amount of spice. My first time having Indian food so I don't have much to compare it to, but it was enjoyable I'm glad we found it. The naan bread was huge and tasted amazing!"}
{"text":"Moderate to good food if you are looking for fast n quick indian food on the strip located on the 3floor of the mall 
 Serving is quick and taste is okay"}
{"text":"I was not expecting this food court place to be so good. It wasn't the best Indian food I have had but it was really tasty and very fresh! It is a cool concept too, sort of a full service restaurant meets food court where you order then they give you a buzzer and you wait about the time it would take to make your food had you been in a sit down place, so it is made fresh and tasty! 
I actually think it is a cool concept other places should/ could adopt.
The food was good but not as richly flavored as a few of my favorite Indian places, and I chose mild spice because it is usually still quite spicy, but here I think I would opt for Medium since the dish we got had no spice to it at all, but that is just a preference thing, sort of like how different brands of clothing fit differently. 
We got the butter chicken, my personal favorite Indian dish, and an order of their vegetable samosas. The Chicken was tasty and tender and their rice was good too. The samosas unlike the chicken were quite spicy, they were rich in flavor and served piping hot! They serve them with the two traditional dipping sauces, one a sweet tamarind sort of sauce and the other a green earthy tasting sauce. 
The naan we got with the meal was just okay, and sort of had a pretzel bread flavor to it I didn't care for. It was also thinner than most naan I have had before, and no real depth of flavor. 
Overall it was good, and certainly the best quality place in this food court, if I was in the mall and it was meal time I would likely consider ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Meh. It's ok. Chicken tikka was dry and flavorless. The curry madras was pretty good. We also got the non vegetarian combo platter. That was really good but kinda pricey for strip mall food at 14.99. It's not fast food either. Takes like 10-15 mins to make. There doesn't seem to be a lot of Indian options in Vegas and near the strip. The chicken masala was probably best. The naan is really good too. They don't offer ice water but they will give you a cup to fill up at the water fountain near the bathrooms lol."}
{"text":"Very good food th at available 24 hrs ! Punjabi dishes are fantastic ..only drawback that the place is very small and often gets too crowded making waiting hours longer"}
{"text":"One of the very best. We had the vegetarian thali. The selection is wide and the taste authentic. The lady at the counter is very knowledgeable about the ingredients and could answer all the minute details that I usually need before I order food. Would visit again."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian food you can find within a two mile radius of the strip. I am extremely picky when it comes to Indian food but this place won my heart. Disclaimer : I only tried Vegetarian food here. Vegetarian Thali (fixed three entrees - palak paneer, chana masala, and dal makhni), Chana Bhatura, and Gobi Manchurian. All are great options! Gobi Manchurian was better than any I've had in the United States. Conveniently located in the food court of the Fashion mall in front of Wynn hotel on the strip, this place is a gem. I am so glad I found this place...So much so that I am writing this review as I finish my first meal!"}
{"text":"Really gone downhill since leaving Riviera.   Used to go several times per year when in Riviera and butter chicken was always fantastic.  It's clear that they've switched over to the cheapest low quality chicken they can find.  First time I ordered butter chicken in the mall, there was almost no chicken.  It was just a few chicken shavings no wider than the tones on my fork.  Second time each piece of chicken was attached to big wads of fat.  Third time, there was fat and a bunch of hard slivers of what appeared to be bone or cartilage.  Overall, the food is disgusting.  Really disappointing what the owners have let happen to a formerly terrific restaurant."}
{"text":"With it's hidden location inside the Riviera Hotel, you would never know about it unless you \"Yelp\"-ed it.  

On a search for great Indian food, my dear friend and fellow Yelper found this place doing a Yelp search for food in town.  Neither one us had been there before so we figured why not, what the hey!?!?! 

I can't believe it's 24 hours!! That's epically fabulous!! 

The food served mild still had kick and flavour, and the service was fabulous.  Served fresh & piping hot.  You have to wait a bit to get your order but if it means it's 'cooked to serve', I'll take it :)

Headed back to Vegas tomorrowand you can be sure I am attempting to make a stop at the Riviera just for my Masala fix :)"}
{"text":"I had to wait for a long time for Indian fast food over 15 minutes. The nan bread was the best part fluffy with some crispness to it. The curry was cold to the touch and was extremely greasy. The curry was very flavorful. The portions were on the large side and it was served with a lot of rice which was drowning in butter or oil.   I'm not in a rush to come back."}
{"text":"We had been to the India Masala in the Riviera before it was demolished, and really enjoyed it.  So when we found ourselves in Vegas for a relatives birthday, we thought we'd hit up this location for lunch.  It was not a bad call.  The food was delicious with just the right amount of heat, and service was friendly.  The only down side is that we weren't expecting a buffet, so we didn't get to order our favorite dish (there's traditional dinner service, but lunch is a buffet).  Still, it was excellent.  I'd definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food! I had their Paneer Butter Masala and it was very delicious! I would come here again."}
{"text":"Located in the corner of the food court at the Riviera. Easy to miss, but well worth the search. The workers were VERY friendly, helpful and patient. Excellent service. I ordered the Chicken Vindaloo (requested extra spicy), and my friends ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala. Both dishes come with rice and naan. Both come out to ~$13 after tax. Both plates give large portions relative to all other Indian cuisines I've been to. 

CHICKEN VINDALOO: kinda spicy, I had hoped for spicier, but oh well. I loved it. They use dark meat from the chicken and don't skimp out on your portion. The potatoes could've been better prepared. It was a little hard or undercooked maybe. The sauce was amazing and very well spiced. Rice was okay; no comments there. The naan was great and fluffy, and it was pretty heavily glistened with butter. 

CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA: I tasted some of my friend's tikka masala and I thought it was also really good. Definitely one of the best plates I've had for Indian cuisine. It was reasonably spicy and spiced perfectly. Not many other comments since I only tasted it. 


My 8 hour drive back in traffic was terrible. Not because of the traffic, but because everytime I thought about the chicken vindaloo I had, my mouth would salivate. Heavily. Hell, even as I write this review, I'm practically drooling. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Decor was nice. Greeted well at the door. Sami came by several times to check on us. The owner also came by several times to ask about our food. Service was exceptional. Food was exceptional. Ambiance was excellent. We had the pakoras for appetizers. Excellent. Chicken jalfrezi and chicken korma were top notch. Shrimp in s red sauce was very very good. The naans were hot and fresh. Service was very very impressive. Definitely highly recommend. Sami's attention and friendliness is the reason I'll be back. And dessert of Gulab jamun with coconut was not sweet. Just right. And the chai hit the right spot. 

Keep up the excellent work."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this restaurant is that it is open 24 hrs. But the Menu after 10.30 is very limited. We went there for Dinner, since it was late in the night, and nothing else was open. Food was decent, so we thought the breakfast the next day would be good too, but their Aloo paratha was not at all like a reglar aloo paratha, the aloo in it was scarce. The ambience is a put off too, since it is in the food court of a vey old casino. Appears shady compared to all other casinos in Vegas. I would not recommend unless you want indian food after 11 pm."}
{"text":"Really good food, authentic Indian food I would say. We tried the Veg thali and the Veg Biryani, both of them were really yummy. The server Aliya was also very kind and helpful. Considering the cost, quality and service I would definitely recommend this Fast Food joint."}
{"text":"Visited India Masala last weekend after looking for good India food on Yelp. The food \"hit the spot\", was very authentic and I guess the best Indian food I ever had in Vegas. It is located in Riviera's food court (not the best place in vegas) but the good food compensates for the ambience.
5 stars for food (-1 ambience). I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Food was so so at this place and kinda pricey too but the only thing they need badly is customer service. None of them greet you or even smile. Maybe you have to pay for their smiling too I guess....lol"}
{"text":"Ah, dosa.... how I love thee and let me count the ways.  I love it when you come out of the kitchen piping hot and appear thin and crispy.  Oh, and those chutneys that bring out all of your flavor... you know the ones... coconut and tomato? Scrumptuous! And, when the masala that fills your cripsy shell is superb (bonus points for the cashews), well... you had me at \"Hello.\" Your crowning achievement: you were made in a Grade A (per the Health Dept.) establishment by people who are the real deal.  Too bad that I have to go to the Riviera Casino (aka the hotel the Strip wishes it forgot) to find you.  Otherwise, it would have been a love affair for the ages."}
{"text":"I just really like this place..   Been coming here since they opened.     It's a food court, and it's in the Riv, and it's in LV .. so the ambiance isn't my style - but the food more than makes up for it and the kitchen/counter staff have always been friendly.  

Best bet is the vegetable manjurian.     The spice sneaks up on you a little..    damn good and unique dish - and it's vegetarian so anyone can enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I thought the food here was actually quite decent given its mall food court status. I got the butter chicken with rice and naan, and the flavors were quite good. The chicken was a tad bit stringy and dry, but the curry itself was flavorful and tasty. Both my dad and sister liked it. The naan was so fluffy and slathered in butter. 

I thought the service could have been better. The girl was a bit disinterested and sounded annoyed that I was asking her really basic questions about the menu (\"What's in the thali?\"). Also, if you want water, they will give you a cup and direct you to fill it in the water fountain around the corner. I would almost rather they just say no, no water. Filling it at the water fountain was weird, especially since the water didn't taste that great."}
{"text":"I love me some indian masala and this place does indian exactly how I like it spicey and fresh.    You will not go hungry here, and the price is perfect.  We had the buffet, its so killer.  I have to go back soon.  Mmmm MMMmmmm  Good....get some!"}
{"text":"The Yelp review says this place has four stars.  This ranking clearly applies to the food, which is indeed tasty and fresh.  Well prepared.  Naan was puffy, doughy and crispy.  What did NOT seem to warrant the stars was the location - this place is located in the Food Court of the Riviera.  The excellent food, served on paper plates with plastic forks within the common area of the court brought a feeling of anticappointment - not the kind of ambience the four-stars erroneously suggested.  Come for the great food...but take it somewhere else to enjoy."}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat at. My first time eating real Indian food was here at India Masala and started an addiction. started from eating samosas every day as a snack (GREAT VEGAN OPTION AND IM NOT EVEN VEGAN) Also had the masala dosa, tikka masala and the butter chicken, ALL FIRE. i'm ready to try any and all of their options whenever i get the chance. Awesome customer service from them every single time as well."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Indian food, and wow I'm impressed how this fast food Indian restaurant is surprisingly good! I have so many great things to say about this place. First off, the service is excellent! The cashier was kind enough to let my boyfriend & I try the sauces out since it was our first time ordering Indian food. I had no clue what to order, so she recommended the Chicken Tikka Masala w/ the Garlic Naan. I also tried the Vegetable Samosa.. So tasty & flavorful. This place is amazing and will not disappoint! I most definitely will be returning very soon! :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the non-vege Thali which is overpriced, in my opinion at $14.99 for a combo. I got my food and the naan bread had about 2 tsp of oil on top of it, and my chicken tikka masala had only ONE piece of chicken in it! The chicken curry and tikka masala were bland! I was thoroughly disgusted by the whole experience. (Oh, and the guy at the counter mumbled and I could hardly understand him.)"}
{"text":"Sad. Didn't like the Indian food. I was longing to eat good Indian food. Truly left disappointed.  Also the Quantity was little . And the food was not delicious."}
{"text":"After a very long day at a trade show, I trekked back to my hotel on a chilly Las Vegas evening.  I was very hungry but didn't have the energy to sit down and stay awake for a long meal.  Fortunately, the Yelp app on my phone pointed me to India Masala for some takeout.  

I was hesitant to venture into the lifeless and downright creepy Riviera but  I quickly passed the slot machines and the desperate souls attached to them on my way to the equally comatose food court.

As suicidal thoughts entered my mind, my spirits were promptly lifted by the friendly folks at India Masala.  My eyes wanted the entire menu but I restrained myself with an order of naan, daal maharani, mango lassi, and gulab jamun.  I carted it back to my hotel and devoured it all in no time.  Mmm, gulab jamun.  (I should've tried the entire menu.)

I'd gladly bet that the food at India Masala is the only worthwhile reason to go inside the Riviera.  Thank you, Yelp, for the unexpected surprise."}
{"text":"I just had chana masala (chickpea curry'ish dish). It was so good and so fast!!! The staff was super helpful in selecting a vegan dish and it was done in about three minutes. Love this place and definitely going back."}
{"text":"BOMB!

This place is so good! The family and I wanted to get a bite to eat before watching Society of Seven at the Riveria Hotel and Casino so we made our merry way to the Food Court since there's a variety to choose from.

Walking up to the food court, you can instantly smell the wonderful spices used in Indian food. I LOVE Indian food so of course I didn't care to check out the other spots, I wanted some curry and naan! 

I ordered the chicken tikka masal, chicken vindaloo and naan. OMG, so freaking good! Both were served with white rice. The naan was like the size of my face! It was coated in butter and I used it to soak up sauce from my dish. The chicken vindaloo was my favorite. It was nice and spicy and had a ton of flavor.  I devoured the whole thing and ate some of the chicken tikka masal since that was my sister's dish. She liked it too. It could have been spicier but that's just personal preference. 

It was kinda expensive but Indian food is kind of expensive as is. Each entrée was $10.99 and the naan was $1.99. The food took a while to come out but it was worth the wait. I got a cup of water and the guy said if I wanted more water he'd fill it up for me. That was nice of him!

I really like this place. When I go back to Vegas, I will for sure come here for my Indian fix. I'm craving Indian food for dinner now!

Best part: It's open 24 hours!! As good as it gets!!"}
{"text":"It's too worst restaurant, they don't even know what food items they are making. Chicken Biryani, I never have such kind of biryani, it's not biryani, chicken pieces are dry and hard, rice was not good, funny and  one of the worst part was they add lemon pickle on top of it."}
{"text":"What a ripoff!!!!
 paid $12.99 for tikka masala , I got something like soup with 4 little chicken cubes."}
{"text":"It was worth walking 20 minutes to reach the place...
I ordered vegetarian Thali and Mango Lassi
Must try for sure :)"}
{"text":"For location and atmosphere this place is 1 star - Located in a bordering-on-skeezy food court at The Riviera.

Food is great however - extremely decent, with some of the hugest and tastiest naan around.

I wouldn't go here over most of the sit down places in town, simply because I want some service and don't like food courts, but if you're trapped at The Riviera this is infinitely better than the rest of the crap they serve up (It sure was depressing to see how the vast majority of people opted for lowest common denominator hamburgers and hot dogs over wonderful Indian cuisine)."}
{"text":"Nos attentes etaient un peu trop hautes pour ce restaurant je crois.  On a pas ete chanceux et on a eu um nouveau serveur. Plus de 30 min attendre poir le souper ... peu etre parceque on a pas pris les combos qui sont populaire. Cest un pas pire resto si tu veux vraiement pas aller sur lile de montreal pis tu as pas essayer trop de places quand on avais vu le rating 5 etoiles on sattendais a un miracle... finalement decu"}
{"text":"not bad for indian fast food. food was fresh, hot, tasted really good, and the serves are big. their Dosa and Sambar is very good. their Butter Chicken was done right and the Naan served with the combo plates was huge and delicious. it is in the Riviera food court so seating was limited during their busy hours and the seating area was a little dirty. will eat from here again next time im in town but might take it to go and eat it in the comfort of my timeshare!"}
{"text":"This place was GREAT!!!!!!  The only thing better than late night Indian Food is Great late night Indian Food.  A little pricey, but very, very good."}
{"text":"My wife and I went shopping and were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food at India Masala. We enjoyed both the chicken Teaka masala and the garlic chicken. Their garlic nan is amazing. The service and staff are excellent."}
{"text":"What a great surprise in a food court!  A little expensive, but the best food available in the Riviera hotel!  Healthy and full of flavor!"}
{"text":"Excellent Indian Food in a Fashionshow Mall across from Wynn. Presentation was good. Both Veg and Non-Veg Thali's provide excellent choices. One comment to the owner's - if someone asks for a glass for water - please be courteous and provide one. There is no reason to promote water bottles."}
{"text":"Don't go for a look of this place cause this place is legit, I found this place almost two years a go and I have been here few times already and I am from houston, it's quick service and it's delicious, I love their daal. I make sure I come here every time I am in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"At Fashion Show Mall food court, i always eat at India Masala simply because their meals aren't greasy like all others there, plus they serve some grain soups. Monica at the register, is always alarmed for your order, to convey it to the kitchen, grab and serve it to you in no time. (This place also gives you buzzers notify you) She will take her time to tell you about the ingredients and makings of the dishes as well."}
{"text":"I was recommended this place by friends who said the dosas and chai were authentic Indian. I have to say, I didn't care for the food at all. 

I ordered the plain dosa which came with a delicious cold coconut sauce. The sambal and salsa sauce were not tasty. 

Also ordered the Gulab jamun dessert which was ok. I've had way better elsewhere. 

The chai tea was the most disappointing as I was really looking forward to tasting the cardamom and ginger flavours of india. 

Finally, I tried an order of plain butter naan and garlic naan which were tasty on their own. 

I realize this is at a food court so expectations need to be kept low."}
{"text":"After Misti Y.'s Hall Monitor CMYE, a few of us decided to walk across to the Riviera for some India Masala action. Its location is kinda odd being part of a food court than a free standing restaurant.

Their menu is pretty extensive, offering curries, dosas, and vegetarian items as well. I split the Tandoori grill Combo with the wifey and the portions were pretty generous, but the price ($15) was pretty steep for a food court entree

Taste is everything and every bite was delicious as was the naan and chutneys that came with our order. we don't frequent Indian dining spots as much (because my stomach is craving Goyemon most of the time)
but I'd like to return to try their other items...ALOHA!!!

{"text":"Not bad for fast food. 

Inside the fashion show mall, this was a bit pricey at $12.99 for a chicken tikka masala, but the dish was a good size and the naan was big and fresh, and of course, it's Vegas!

The chicken was a bit tough/overcooked but the sauce was ok. The naan was definitely my favorite."}
{"text":"Horrible place!
We ordered 2 non veg thali and waited for abt 15 mins only to get 2 freaking veg thalis. The cashier said he heard veg thalis. Idk how he heard that coz  we were 6 ppl and one of my friends was ordering the food and we all heard him saying non veg. Coz none of us like only veggie. There was a hispanic looking guy who came and asked to pay $4 more for 2 extra plates of chicken and we did so. I would have still given this place a 3 star rating inspite of the bad argument we had. But rice was horrible. Idk why they cant afford a good basmati rice. Never had such worse rice in my life. And what would i do with my chicken tikka masala without rice.? We all were so pissed. That one star is for staying open 24 hrs."}
{"text":"Last month we visited this place for the lunch time and they have buffet going on. We just tried their buffet and everything was really good.
They have something with medu vada with yogurt and it's really good."}
{"text":"For a food court on the Vegas strip the food was really good. I had the chicken biryani which was really good and the price was no bad @ 10.95.

They also have several thalis which come with a nan, rice and 3 types of curry which was good. really enjoy eating some Indian food right on the strip."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the high quality indian food at a food court. I ordered the chicken tikka masala and nan, so good!! I am indian and approve :)"}
{"text":"Amazing taste. Yummy paneer butter masala and butter chicken. You must try it.
This like a home for me now as I am in town for business every two months.

Real Indian taste.

Try it once!!! You might make a trip to Vegas just to eat here. If you are a foodie.

{"text":"Had a gr8 experience! Sarav was really nice ! We had dinner on feb 10th 2016 & went back coz of Sarv & had brunch before heading back to L.A ."}
{"text":"I took the suggestions and had the dosa masala. I also added some vegetable pakoras, and they were all very good.  Very tasty, well prepared, very much worth the price. 

I like to judge ethnic food by how many people of that ethnicity are actually present at the restaurant when I am there eating.  Its safe to say that the Indian community is well aware of India Masala and are pleased with the food that is presented there.  That to me, is a sign of a winner."}
{"text":"The Good:
Open 24 hours.
Dosa tastes well.
Food is ready in less than 10 minutes.

The bad:
Other items such as Chana Masala or Chilli Panner tastes bad. 

Always order something that can be prepared fast like dosa."}
{"text":"We came here once, while on a five day vacation to Vegas, and we just continued to come here for almost all meals. I loved the vegetarian thali, chole bhaturas, chicken biryani, seekh kababs. Sweet lassi and mango lassi are not that great. But chai is good. Prices are decent as compared to what you have to pay for everything at Vegas. Location is also great as the fashion mall is quite close to all hotels at the strip! For a fast food place, it really was above our expectations."}
{"text":"Great indian food at Fashion show mall.Awesome taste  and authentic indian food
Had Chole Batura/idli/chicken curry/chicken chetinad/mutton biryani

All above items were 5* except biryani would be 3.5*
Not to mention their Tea , it was nice"}
{"text":"Very good indian food. Specially Dal Maharani, mutter paneer and chai. I liked naan and biryani as well."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of the Indian food been since I eat in that place I absolutely love it that's the only Indian food  place that I really love"}
{"text":"I don't normally come to a mall to enjoy good food, but the Fashion Show Mall finally has quality food in their food court! Every mall has a Panda Express as their \"ethnic\" food, but for once another culture is represented. 

My friend usually orders my Indian food for me, but since I was alone I didn't know what to order. Monica was really nice and let me try 3 of their top curry sauces. I ended up ordering the palak paneer because it was the lightest in taste; it wasn't too spicy but has the perfect amount of flavor. 

Palak paneer is a vegetarian Indian dish consisting of spinach, tomato gravy sauce and paneer in a thick paste made from puréed spinach and seasoned with garlic, garam masala, and other spices. My dish came with firm tofu pieces, rice, and a HUGE naan. 

Overall: the food was delicious, the portion was fair and worth the $11.99, and the customer service was great!"}
{"text":"Excellent . They have a wide selection for the lunch buffet and include a drink.. also they make fresh naan and dosa to order .. it's excellent"}
{"text":"Worst food I have ever had. Ridiculous, horrible food we went because of the reviews we read in yelp we will never return there even if we were starving or may be you can say dying for indian food. Never in my life again. Big black spot on vegas , indian and punjabi taste. I think they serve much better food in indian jails then this place. Horrible and nasty food joint."}
{"text":"Very good vegan options if you're looking for a quick bite while shopping. Their aloo gobi is the best and most flavorful I've had. Lots of onions and spices! They have one soup which is very nice and somewhat spicy as well."}
{"text":"Delicious Indian food that you get instantly, no wait. Try everything here it's all amazing. Masala Dosa with buttermilk is delicious"}
{"text":"Wow. Very surprised. Simple and flavorful - real Indian food. Even my parents liked it and they are hardly ever happy with takeout Indian. Even the lassi wasn't too sweet. Better than the Indian restaurants we tried too."}
{"text":"There aren't that many highly rated Indian restaurant on the strip (so it seems - please message me if am wrong) so we went for what, according to other yelpers, was above average. First, it turns out that this place is inside a mall and is part of the food court ensemble. This is not obvious from the address. Nevertheless, we waited to be delighted by some savory Indian food but left with a rather mixed score. I ordered the vegetarian thali which is served with three side dishes, yogurt, pickle, rice, and a naan. 
Let's start with the good. The naan was really thin, crisp and yummy. A perfectly charred creation from the clay oven. Yogurt raita was fine as well. Mango lassi was simply marvelous. The three dishes - Chick peas, Saag, and Lentils - were surprisingly sub-par. For one, they were served a bit cold. Second the saag and chick peas just didn't have any zest and tasted very \"formulaic\" with no character. None of the flavors really stood out. Almost as if the cook's heart was not it. 
Serving was quick - it's after all inside a mall's food court.  We just wanted something within walking distance this time but will dig deeper for good Indian food on the next trip."}
{"text":"I was starting to crave some Indian food and I walked up to the counter to read the menu items. After standing at the register for a solid 3 minutes, the young man at the register never offered to answer any questions or even acknowledge me. I asked him what size cup is available for the mango lassi, and his apathetic answer was \"About a 12 ounce?\" ... I pointed at the soft drink cups and said \"so roughly that size?\" and he only goes \"yeah something like that\"

It would've. Just been easier to grab a cup for your lassi and show me? He was too busy on his cell phone, though."}
{"text":"Tasty food but seemed a bit pricey given the bad ambience. Good thing about it- open 24/7.Worth a try!"}
{"text":"My first time to  this outlet and I must say it was really a pleasant experience. Strolling down the mall, on business, lunch time in the foodcourt was India Masala. 

A clean tidy Indian fast food operation, with a pretty extensive menu to suit all Indian style taste buds. We tried the Masala Dosa (this is the second time in this week for me) - and my friend order the same too.

Very good quality, at an inexpensive price, the dosa was crisp and filling was true to the Indian flavor, accompanied by sambar and chutneys - both very good. 

I strongly recommend visiting India Masala, foodcourt when you are there. Its probably the best food in that foodcourt, all other outlets look really tried 

Good work"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian food I had in Vegas. only down side is, its in a food court and most times, I had to wait 10 mins minimum to get my food. if you like Tandoori, Tandoori Combo gives a small portion of different tandoori dish (Caution: Longer wait time for this dish) my favorite. 

I have tried chicken biriyani, butter chicken combo, utthapam and Tandoori combo. This is a north Indian style kitchen and expecting south Indian dishes like uthappam to be good is my mistake. Biriyani was decent, Butter chicken melted in my mouth. There was a girl on the cash register was explaining that her favorite drink is Mango lassi to one of the person ahead of me in the line, so I wanted to try it out, it turned out to be the best of all Mango lassi I had.

Naan was soft and yummy.  $15.99 for Tandoori Combo may be little pricy, but better than most Indian lunch buffet I had in Vegas.

I learned that they have another restaurant near the strip where they have buffet (India Masala Bar & Grill - 1040 E Flamingo Rd Las Vegas, NV 89119) and more like proper restaurant. I am going to try it the next time when I will be in Vegas.

This joint is located in Riviera Hotel's food mall, you can park for free at Riviera self parking at the rear of the Riviera casino.

Bottom line: Nice little joint for good tasty North Indian food."}
{"text":"The food is not great, but good for a one time snack. We got the Veg thali, Chole bhatura, Nan and Sabzi, Gulab jamun and chai. The quantity was okay, less than most Indian restaurants. Overall, meh!"}

open 24 hrs 
we went with friends ordered naan ,dosa ,Malai kofta etc.,
Dosa is tasteless!!

Were going to eat around the clock tonight. 

Located in the Riveria, all the way in the back in the food court, in a tiny corner and its open 24 hours. Limited late night menu after 10:30pm, and breakfast 5am till 10am.

Prices range from about $11 and up per dish. So by food court standards its expensive. I ordered 2 dishes and the guy wanted to make sure someone was eating with me, since it was a lot if food. Lol...do I look like I can eat all that? Even if I was going to eat it all, it was none of his business. 

I ordered chicken Tikka and it was sprinkled in some kind of curry powder and was very dry. The meat was red on the outside,  like tandori chicken usually is. Not the chicken tikka Im used too. Wasnt the best. I also ordered the chicken tikka Masala with was 75% sauce 25% chicken, served with equal parts of white rice.

I have access to really good Indian food in the OC and I am not a fan of this food. And I was left hungry and disappointed. The beast, however enjoyed his meal and has a tradition of coming here  every year when hes in town.

Im not a fan, but others dig it. 2.5 stars rounding up to 3. Be prepared to eat on Styrofoam plates and plastic utensils."}

{"text":"This place has great food, absolutely delicious and authentic Indian cuisine.  This is real food and not the typical fast food you find in the mall.  I was surprised that the food quality and taste is fantastic for being in the mall food court.  My favorite is the tandoori chicken, butter chicken, and mango lassi drink."}
{"text":"Mediocre Indian Food. Good Quantity, poor quality."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised!  After a long morning of shopping, we started getting hungry.  The other restaurants in the food court seemed questionable and so we decided to take a chance here and I'm happy we did.  The butter chicken curry was DELiCIoUS.  Perfectly seasoned with just the right consistency, it was actually better than a lot of the other Indian restaurants I've been too!  
The naan and rice were a great complement to the curry and it left me wanting more.  I'll be back."}

They do have lot of seating arrangement though its inside the casino. Served with care."}
{"text":"This is one of Fashion Show mall's food court shacks, I admit that I went in with low expectations, thinking that a food court restaurant will probably not offer typical Indian food. I was wrong, there Chicken Masala in on par with any good Indian restaurant. The Tandoori bread was also fresh and authentic. Their menu offer other classics, kabob and such. I would come back try the rest."}
{"text":"I had been going to this place for some times now.  They used be in food court of Reviera Hotels and Casino on South Las Vegas Blvd aka The Strip.  Now they have relocated to The Fashion Island... But the teast and service remains same.  

I had ordered Butter Paneer Masala with rice and naan... It was delicious! My wife and dad had Dosa...and my daughter had Chole Bhatuda... ALL GONE!  Their Chicken is also excellent.  

However, they can improve their Chicken 65 dish... it was little too dry...The best Chicken 65 I had was in Atlanta (next to The Patel Brothers...there is Indo-Chinese Fusion place).

None of less, the service and staff are very friendly and excellent.  One major improvement is now they have eBuzzer... so when your order is ready...the assigned buzzer  goes off... they dont scream/yell your name in speaker when your order is ready! 

India Masala...you will always be my GoTo place....

Thanks
Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great Indian food! I had the Tikka Masala very spicy and it delivered (obviously it's a British dish).  The naan was good too. Hot and soft and the bottom was crispy.  The people working were very nice too."}
{"text":"The butter chicken and naan bread is a must have on their menu. They give you a nice portion size too. Easily one of the best Indian restaurants on the strip and it's inside the Fashion Show mall so who doesn't like that?! Customer service is always the best too."}
{"text":"Food is good. Not the greatest but good. 


The girl on the other hand is rude. Came here the other day and was VERY unsatisfied with her attitude, she is not welcoming. Gave it another try today, surprise surprise she is still rude. Interesting business model, no wonder it isn't very busy. How disappointing"}
{"text":"They served good food. Naans are made to order.  Food was quite good. And they are open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Its a food court, I had to wait in queue for ~ 30min & it was not worth waiting...

poori chana - tastes OK
Uttapam - not so good
masala dosa - was fine
masala tea - not so great"}
{"text":"Good food. Ordered Veg Combo, Shahi Paneer and Mango Lassi. Naan was amazing. A little expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"Trying this place for the first time and let me just say this, it won't be the last! It was like love at first sight! Delicious food indeed! Don't even get me started with service, their team offer variaties of recommendation from mild to hot depending on your taste bud feels. You might even spot your favorite dish in their menu. Easily accessible from the 3rd floor food court and with the big sign, it'll he hard to miss AND resist!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome. Authentic Indian food. The service and the staff wasn't  that friendly and customer centric but food is awesome."}
{"text":"A couple of weeks ago my husband and I went to a festival celebrating Indian culture and food at the county building. While there, we sampled food from several Indian restaurants around town, and were most pleased with what we had at the booth of India Masala, which is permanently located in the Riviera. For the first time we had dosa, a lentil and rice pancake/crepe that is a typical dish of Southern India. We happened to pick up a postcard offering 25% off our check so we decided to head to the Riviera to see what else was being offered.

It's no surprise that the Riviera is on its last legs, and ranks up there with Circus Circus as being the most rundown hotel on the strip. We certainly worked up an appetite as we made the looooong walk from the parking garage to the food court (next time I'd valet in the front of the casino). No, we weren't expecting Indian Masala to be a semi-fast food restaurant, but as it turns out, it was. The prices aren't really justified considering this, but the food is really good and it was packed with more Indians and convention attendees than any other tenant's space when we were there (see below), so we figured it was safe to stay. We had to wait about in line for five minutes and then another ten minutes or so for our food, which was a bit frustrating, but I felt rewarded when I got my dosa. Today I opted for one stuffed with spinach, the palak dosa ($7.99), but you can also choose from a filling of chickpeas (chole), potatoes (masala), or no filling at all (plain). It is served with what I learned to be the traditional accompaniments, sambar (a vegetable soup) and coconut chutney (imagine a thick and textured almond milk). There is also a third side that I can best describe as a pureed and spiced red bell pepper spread. The dosa is flavorful enough on its own, but the sauces add another dimension and were very much enjoyed. The dosa itself is delicate, with a browned, crisp exterior and a soft, lightly chewy interior. You can get a better idea of the textural difference when you order it plain, but the filling makes it a meal. I must say it's a dish that's growing on me, and I'd bear the pain of walking through that casino to enjoy another one day. My husband was less thrilled with his dish, but it seems to me that the emphasis here is on lesser known Southern Indian cuisine so chicken vindaloo ($11.99) might not have been the best option. This vindaloo was flavorful but not nearly hot enough for Ian who asked them to make it as spicy as possible. The larger problem was the color of the sauce, which was reminiscent of an artificially colored sweet and sour. The color should have been deeper and darker had it been a result of the spices. Things that don't look natural probably aren't, so we'll just say this color most likely wasn't derived from where it should have been.

If you are interested in trying a new kind of Indian dish that isn't available at other restaurants around town (as far as I know), I would definitely recommend coming here for the dosa. I'd be willing to try a few other things but I think what I had was the most reasonably priced for you what you get, and certainly the most unique."}
{"text":"Thank you Sheila B. for piquing my interest.  Eric R. and I did a few hikes at Valley of Fire state park and headed back to Vegas around 2 PM starving.  He asked me if I had anything bookmarked on the north strip (look at him, pretending to know everything about Yelp!) and I said India Masala at the Riviera!!! haha we laughed - I had never been to the Riviera ever!

We parked and wandered through the maze and there it was, in the food court.  I ordered a masala dosa and Eric got the tandoori combo.  His came with naan, cilantro chutney, tandoori chicken on the bone, chicken tikka, chicken kabob, some other chicken seasoned, and daal (lentils).  Mine came with coconut and tomato chutneys and spiced tomato soup.

The meals were filling and tasty.  I loved the chutneys, especially the cilantro, and it did its justice with my nose running!!  I would return for this \"hidden gem.\""}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service.  Big-portioned tasty food.  Drawback: plastic utensils."}
{"text":"To go place...awesome food..must go for all Indians...its a breather away from all mexican and american food...kee0 up the good work :)see you again :)"}
{"text":"Butter Chicken!

Hmm. What to make of this place. It's Indian food. In a food court. In a strip hotel. OK so it's the Riviera, but still.

Cutting to the chase, the Butter Chicken was yummy. It had bell peppers in it, which stood out for some reason. Maybe because there usually aren't bell peppers in Butter Chicken? IDK. I liked what they brought to the party. The plate comes with a good amount of Basmati Rice, and a ginormous piece of Naan. In my book, it doesn't get much better than savoring some delicious Butter Chicken sauce with some Naan.

So the food was good, but back to the place. The fact that we even have Indian food in a food court in this town makes me happy. The down side is that you're paying more for it. Like I said, it's in a strip hotel, albeit the Riviera. They're probably paying a lot for that location, so their prices are naturally higher. I mean, $12 for a plate of Butter Chicken isn't insane, but it just feels weird because you're in a freakin' food court.

In any case, I left satisfied. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again, but I'd consider it if I'm ever back in the Riviera. Like the next time I watch some roller derby!

p.s. I pretty much always order Mango Lassi if they offer it. I've had better, but it was pretty good."}
{"text":"WORST PLACE!!! Customer service is horrible! They started off by getting my order wrong then when I went back to have it fixed  he told me he could not help me because I forgot my ticket upstairs. He then told me he would give me my money back and then said \" get the fuck out of my restaurant along with a Spanish curse word\"... If I could  give them negative points I would.  That kind of behavior is not acceptable ever!!!"}
{"text":"Though it was in a mall food court, it was surprisingly good. more authentic and better tasting than the other one we went to in the strip. Quantity was good too. will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Tasteless & cold food, over priced, horrible customer service, fungus on wooden plate. I would not come back back here for sure!!"}
{"text":"Food tastes awesome ambience is not that good, staff are very good and responsive... Go for thali that tastes awesome... Breakfast tiffins like dosa are excellent, tea tastes indian style.... If you want to eat indian food this is one of the best options in Vegas"}
{"text":"Having food here for second time. They have really very good and tasty food. Mine favorite Gulab Jamun was better than my expectations.
Sometime the waiting would me more at peak hours. Except that its awesome.
One fo the best place to kill your hunger with satisfying your taste buds. Thank you guys. You are doing good job."}
{"text":"Food is served fresh...very close to home made food. If you are looking for an Indian restaurant..this is the place open round the clock."}
{"text":"We randomly went to this place twice for dinner & lunch buffet while on the trip to Vegas.

Dinner:

We ordered Malai Kofta & Paneer tikka masala, and both were just awesome. In fact, Malai kofta was almost equivalent to the Indian taste.


Lunch buffet:
Everything was good in lunch buffet but I would strongly recommend their Saag Paneer, Goat Biryani (recommendation from friends) & Kheer. Naans were so soft & delicious."}
{"text":"Toujours excellent!
La nourriture est à chaque fois un délice et le service est très attentionné et sympathique.
Je vous le recommande fortement."}
{"text":"I love Indian food. It is a recent obsession and I know the good stuff when I see it. The food at this food court location is very good. The naan is fresh and tasty. All of the entrees are made fresh to order, so let the cooks know how spicy you enjoy  your entrees. 

Service: the staff is use to tourists and questions. They were very friendly and knowledgeable about the products sold. 

Wait time: everything is cooked fresh. If you are in a rush, go to Quiznos subs. The food is worth the 10 minute wait while they cook it. 

Price: pretty pricey for a food court. It was $40 for two waters, to entrees, an app of samosas and bread. This is the same price we pay at a sit-down restaurant. The drinks are not included in the combo price. 

Location: it appears they share a kitchen with a burger joint... Strange for an Indian joint... 

Try this place if you are at the Rivera casino. :)"}
{"text":"OK kinda Indian food .
Thumbs up for 24 hrs"}
{"text":"This place is inside fashion show mall on level 3, food court. The food is okay. I have had better, but given the place and location it'd not that bad."}
{"text":"Really good, given that this is in a food court in a shopping mall, so some things can't be evaluated in the way that they can with a brick and mortar restaurant. 
Naan is often weak at mall Indian restaurants, but is good here.
I found a whole Caradamom pod in (I think) my rice, which made me very happy. One of the indicators for me of good Indian food is the presence of these little flavour bombs. 
I've eaten at this place for a few years and don't vary my purchases much. Aloo Gobi (today) and Palak Paneer being my standard go-to items. 
Pleasant service, tasty food (on the mild side, but again at a mall in the US, to be expected), and a pretty large serving size (I struggled to eat it but I am on the smaller side).
I was irritated with them on the day before Memorial Day when they seriously shrank their menu, around 7pm but they have fully redeemed themselves. 
From my limited but lengthy knowledge of this place I will be a repeat customer for as long as they are here with this management."}
{"text":"Beware guys they lie about halal food!! My friend worked at this location and she told me when the customer ask if the food is halal they say yes but it's not they tell the workers to lie. Both the locations..all the authentic halal meat sellers in Las Vegas have a certificate. And they don't!!!"}
{"text":"Now with a location inside the food court in the Fashion Show Mall, India Masala turns the food court into something else--something better, and I'm really liking it! 

1. They give you a buzzer while you wait for your food so you know exactly when it's ready to be picked up! The only place in that upstairs food court to do this. 

2. It's fast food, but doesn't really taste like fast food. It feels like you're eating a real lunch/dinner, rather than something super greasy or oily or slapped together quickly. 

Now, it's not the best Indian food that I've ever had, but it is fairly priced and they give you a good amount of food, too. 

One thing that I have to mention is that, while my chicken tikka did taste pretty good, it was very over-seasoned. While I don't exactly mind, other people might, so I suggest brushing the spices off or just letting them know--hey, this might be a litteeee overboard. 

Even still; India Masala is, so far, the best food in that food court!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  And LATE LATE LATE!

SITREP

Hot Dam!  What a find when wandering along Las Vegas Blvd at 2am!  

MENU

LV Yelper Paolo had recommended the Butter Chicken, Naan, Rice, ALL GOOD, and this particular dish tends to be my \"litmus test\" for different places from Seattle to Sacramento to L.A. and now Vegas, and I have to say it was De-LISH.

PRICE YIKES!

But the combo was about $14 after tax and tip, with this and something that I would consider to be very pricey if at home or work.  However, this was my Vegas trip and in most situations while traveling, I won't spare the expense for the experience.

THE LOWDOWN

A great find in Vegas for Indian fare!"}
{"text":"This place is not closed. It is under new ownership. One of the best places to experience  Indian food. During the week they have a buffet  for lunch for 9.99 and on the weekends for 10.99."}
{"text":"Shockingly good.  Was actually staying at this hotel and lo and behold really good indian food downstairs.  It was very authentic and tasty.  Definitely recommended if you happen to need indian food after a night of partying."}
{"text":"Thomas is the best! Was really helpful in getting us great food at 6am. Best Indian food in Vegas."}
{"text":"Had chicken tikka masala and it was really good. The price wasn't expensive the whole plate was 12.99 and it came with rice and 1 big naan. Yumm"}
{"text":"Good food... Like their tandoori combo and non veg combo.... People working there are friendly. Would def visit again and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Otherwise good food is made up for by HORRIBLE service and dismissive attitude of teen at the register."}
{"text":"Not going to lie: It is hard for me to distinguish the culinary merits of India Masala from the joy of eating Indian in a food court. Food court discoveries are like finding $20 in your winter coat pocket, unexpected and put to immediate good use. In my world, every food court would have Indian. It would make trips to the mall immensely more pleasurable.

I had known of this McD's killer for quite some time, but it isn't too often that I end up at the Riviera. Actually, prior to the Sin City Rollergirls' bout I had been inside the Riviera a grand total of ZERO times. But, when we rolled up for derby action, I knew where I was headed - to curry land. To my surprise it is located right next to Super Burger (or something like that.) I love the sign.

The menu is extensive, including a nice selection of dosa. I definitely want to return to try one. However, on this trip, I went with the vegetarian combo, which comes with daal, chana masala and saag paneer, plus rice, naan and pickles. At around $12, it was not cheap. However, it did come with a beautiful, gigantic piece of naan. As for the actual dishes, the only one I wasn't fond of was the saag. It was underspiced perhaps as the only flavor was spinach, which I like, but it was a bit plain for me. Everything else was quality. Plus, the people behind the counter were sweet. When our naan was a little crispy, they happily prepared another one for us. As I left, I decided to try their chai, and it was disappointing as it lacked the strong clove and cardamom that I associate with a delicious chai. Alas, I was still happy with my court time experience.

They are open late (approximately 2am), which is a big bonus for night owls. The only odd thing is that the prices go up on the \"After Hours\" menu. However, I didn't see an indication as to when exactly it is after hours. 

Either way, pretty sure I will find myself back in this food court in the future. I am a married lady, but if I weren't I would find a India Masala/Sin City Rollergirls evening an entertaining 4th or 5th date. Just an idea."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem. As good as the food is, India Masala should consider a full restaurant. We had the famous vegetable samosa to start with. And the Chicken Tikka Masala and Masala Dosa was very well seasoned and freshly made with a over sized piece of naan. Jasmine rice also comes with the tikka masala. The food is delicious and they give you plenty of it. The staff was friendly. Seating area is limited since its a food court. The prices are a bit high for Indian food in a food court but after eating here it was well worth it."}

{"text":"Visited India Masala two more times during our stay at the Riviera.  It's still about 3.5 star experience, but I rounded up for the following:

* Owner was very nice and helpful and told me that if I wanted spicy, just ask for extra chilies, which I did and it was much better than cheap-o packages of hot sauce.  She also explained some of the more exotic items on the menu to me.

* The Chicken Tika Masala was OK.  Granted, it was missing more of the complex Indian spices and became one- dimensional after a few bites.  But the nan bread was hot & fresh.  And heck, it's a food court and much better than Subway or pizza-by-the-slice.

* The Veggie Samosas were really quite good and came with tasty mint & tamarind sauce."}
{"text":"Ok food, not authentic south indian. Food was half done. I enjoyed their food when they first opened outside the strip. But the food in the food court was not up to the mark."}
{"text":"Surprisingly tasty....go for it !!!
I ordered for Choley Bhature and mango lassi and both were tasty... Food was very fresh and perfect amount of spices used in Choley. Bhatura were soft and not at all oily ...
Being an Indian I can say u will not be disappointed to eat here"}

{"text":"The food is good, but the service is horrible. You got to wait atleast 20 minutes only to place your order. And that's not because of a long line (I'm the third person in the line for last 20 mins). It's just because no one is at the counter taking orders !"}
{"text":"Vegetarian review: I wish I had known this place existed a few days ago. The food was tasty and the quantity was sufficient for the price. We had the masala dosa and the vegetarian thali. Both were well cooked, not too spring, and filling. For an Indian place in a shopping mall, this was excellent! I wish we had something similar in Texas."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled! This food court corner is run by the same fellas that do some major gourmet Indian cuisine in Vegas and elsewhere! I was floored -- great food. 

Definitely check out their one-of-a-kind fried cauliflower dish."}

{"text":"So good!! I just had a vegetarian lunch...a big pancake of rice and lentil dough with veggies in it and it came with phenomenally good vegetable soup which was perfectly spicy for me who lives spicy food as long as it's not extremely hot. Bookmarking this place for my next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"Look no further for the best Indian food on the strip!  Not like there was fierce competition.  It's pretty interesting that it popped up at the food court of the Riviera of all places.  

I'm still trying to figure out why it's here.  Do guests of the Riviera have a strong fever that can only be satiated with tremendous curry flavors?  All I see are old people playing slots!  It doesn't matter though.  I'm just glad it's here and it's tremendous.

Not only do they have every curry you could want but they serve a lot of south Indian dishes most places don't.  I only wished I was hungrier when I came to try more things.  We ended up ordering the tandoori combo which included 4 different meats and the saag paneer accompanied by 2 orders of naan.  Everything was delicious and I can't wait to go back and try more menu items.

The two reasons for no 5 star rating are the location (hate the parking garage) and the price which is a couple extra dollars more than other places.  There are too many Indian options off the strip for lunch at better price points and they're all you can eat.  Still, it doesn't take away from how good their food is.

I can't believe I actually have a reason to go to the Riviera now!"}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect eating here considering its in a food court so the ambience isn't there at all. 
Seemed kinda sketch for Indian food but I was SO wrong. 
The food was delicious! 
I got shai paneer and my brother got a dosa.
We don't eat onion or garlic and the chef was really accommodating with that too whereas other restaurants are always talking about how everything's premade. 
I will definitely be coming here again! 
There are a variety of vegetarian options as well as those for all you carnivores.
It's convenient that its 24 hours too!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Awesome service. Very friendly staff. I loved the aloo paratha and dosa! Absolutely authentic indian food!"}

{"text":"$29 for two, which bought two entrees that came with sides of rice and 2 giant pieces of Naan (bread) and 2 disanti bottled waters.

Chicken Curry and Naan was unbelievably good. Great place. We were the only non-Indian customers there.

Location is somewhat outside of the Riviera on the corner nearest to the strip. Take the \"Duece\" bus there for only $7 a person for a 24 hour pass. We went to Fremont St after eating here. Was a great night."}
{"text":"Vegetable samosas with a delicious and  refreshing spicy cilantro sauce to complement both the samosa and the tamarind sauce that comes with it too! The palak paneer is so delicious and not too over spiced or under seasoned and it's accompanied with a large naan bread that has been warmed on the grill along side a bed of  soft-fluffy fragrant Jasmine rice...my mouth is watering already!

This place is indeed a hidden gem in the culinary world of the strip. It's in the Riviera Casino's food court! WHO would of known? I just happened to had walked inside with hunger and the scent of Indian home cookery led me to this fabulous place!

If you are hungry (the servings are enough for 2 to share) and are on a budget, but not in a palate budget, then come over for some darn delicious food! Plus, the staff was so calm, patient and helpful!

I will come here again on my next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent, excellent! Delicious meal considering it's from a food court. I got the Vegetarian Thali for lunch and had enough leftover for dinner that night. I'd go back first thing the next time I'm in Las Vegas!"}

The food is ok not great but the fact that they are open 24 hours and I got my cravings satisfied.  I did like the chicken Tika masala. The dal was a bit old. Other than that it was satisfactory meal that's why it gets a 4 star."}
{"text":"Located in the food court. 

As expected food court food prices will be elevated

Food: 4/5
-at $12.99 you get a large naan, generous rice and cubes of chicken tikka masala
-the masala was a bit closer to a watery consistency than a creamy consistency
-wish there was a bit more protein for the price point
-entire meal was closer to $15 after tax and a drink. I'm thinking a buffet may have been a better choice
-food is made to order so expect a wait"}
{"text":"I am certain that the owners of this place do their best to provide their customers a great Indian style meal and great service, however, when the cat's away the mice will play. 

I approached the counter 10 minutes before they close and asked if I could get a plate. I ordered a palak paneer  and asked if it was spicy, which she immediately said no, charged me turned away and dismissed me. No time to order a drink or anything else. 

I really needed that drink because the food was spicy as heck and it ruined the whole meal and experience. I was so close to go back to the counter and just leave the tray with the food there, but decided not to make a scene. 

You might want to hire more customer service oriented staff if you want to avoid reading comments like this! 

Namaste!"}

The dosa was all that it should be, and the coconut chutney was light and refreshing.

The best part for me was the mango lassi.  It's just the way I like it, which is not overly sweet.  I'd go back just for the lassi, my fiancee will return for another dosa.  Def rec."}

{"text":"Before I tell you guys why India Masala in FashionShow Mall is a must go to, let me ask you this. Who doesn't like Indian Food?! Their entire cuisine is a gift for the brilliant flavors they put together to produce excellent dishes for us to consume.

Being said that, I've been dining here for as long as I can remember. And nothing has changed. Excellent food, awesome customer service and most of all, very convenient in terms of access. It's located at the 3rd floor food court and trust me, it'll stand out from it's competitors!

They offer tons of food selections as well as drinks! Best sellers are usually marked on the menu as well! The food is filling, very worth it for its price. You get quality and most of all, a happy stomach!

I highly recommend this place to anyone who's willing to learn about the culture and discover awesome food!

Shouting out Monica DiDi and their entire team for always recommending me with spectacular food!"}
{"text":"These people are so dumb. They just make people stand in line which doesn't move even at a snail's pace. Food is decent though but not worth the long wait."}
{"text":"When a lot of Indian people give a good rating on yelp to an Indian restaurant, you can be quite certain that the food is going to be really good. And it was! The yellow dal and mattar paneer plates were really nice. It was flavorful and satisfied our Indian food cravings. It's in the food court of Riviera casino. It's not a fancy place."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, I only went to this place because of the reviews I read on Yelp.

Definitely not disappointed. I truly would have never found this place if it were not for Yelp. And probably even if I did, I would have been reluctant to try it since it is in a food court.

If you are going to India Masala it is for nothing else but good food. I mean who says I am going to the food court to eat dinner? Other than maybe high school kids. 

Prices were a bit pricey for a food court but it is in a hotel on the strip. However, to my surprise I had more than enough food and could hardly finish my meal. I paid about $15.00 for a butter chicken (spicy) meal with rice, naan and soda. I definitely was not disappointed. 


You wait a little longer for your food than we would be accustomed to in a food court setting but my food was fresh and oh so good. I am literally salivating now just thinking about it. 

My only set back was I had one little piece of lemon grass that was too big so when I bit into it it was not fun for me.

Good sign for me is when I see native people eating their own food. There is nothing worse than going to an ethnic place to eat and you do not see any people of their own kind there.

Best Naan in town, hands down.

This is definate must try for any Indian Food Lovers. You can not be disappointed. It is definate return and new fave for me."}
{"text":"The food is average, what I really disliked is that they refuse to give even a cup of water with the food. I guess they really want to extract the cost of drinks from you (which is overpriced). Also, they change extra for using the card. The person at the counter was far from pleasant."}
{"text":"I was on strip with my fella and decided to grab a quick bite at the Riviera. I remembered they had a food court and recalled some positive reviews for India Masala. 

My expectations were low, but I persevered. I ordered the chicken tikka masala which came with rice and a side of naan.

The curry was decent. Not very spicy and more on the bland side than I would prefer, but still ok. The rice was dry and overcooked. It was clearly sitting around a while so I avoided it. The naan was my favorite part of the meal. It was overly oily, but delicious. We were tempted to order an extra one for dipping, but decided against it.

Decent for a food court and probably ten times better than the other food court options at the Riviera, but that isn't saying much."}
{"text":"Never go here below is the review 

Chai was cold

Panner Butter masala tasted like it was 2 or 3 days old and served to me just by heating it up

Thali which my wife tried was horrible

Only good thing was Naan"}
