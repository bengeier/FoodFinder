{"text":"Wow. Never been in a restaurant where we were told the food will show up long before your cocktails...They must have hired amateurs to run the bar. Terrible bar service."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to dinner with two other couples. Two of us ordered the paella. The waitress times it perfectly with the other orders. All the food was excellent.  Service was great. It's a little pricey but worth it. They are starting a happy hour soon."}
{"text":"Went for the first time night.  Loved it.  Great food and great value.  The paella was listed on the menu as being a dish for two but could easily feed more.  It was huge.  Chock full of all the good stuff and, at $38, a bargain.  Enjoyed a couple of apps and bread pudding for dessert was also a highlight."}
{"text":"This is an enormous waste of time. We had a party of four Weds night at 6:30 for the rooftop.  Checked in with hostess who could not be more annoyed that customers were in her presence.  While being seated upstairs we asked if the heaters would be turned on and were told \"you have to ask your server\".  Ok, except we never saw one in the 15 minutes we sat there.  No waters, no nothing.  We got up and went down to main dining room assuming we'd get better service there.  Nope.  No one came to our table for about 10 minutes.  Finally an older gentleman dropped off 4 waters without saying a word.  No \"welcome to Bacan\".  So weird.  He finally came over and told us our server would be with us in a couple minutes.  Another 10 minutes went by.  We left.  Bartender was behind an empty bar doing nothing.   I would think she would come out and at least get drink orders.  Restaurant was only about 1/3 full and couple at table next to ours we're having the same experience and not happy. This place needs to get its shit together regarding service.  Horrible.  Will not be back.  Too bad."}
{"text":"A great addition for dining choices in Care Free.  Bacán Restobar is located in Spanish Village center in the spot that Care Free Station formerly occupied.   There is patio and indoor dining.   We sampled their tasty Gazpacho Soup with crab claws.  The four claws along the glass rim were moist and sweet.  For small plates or bites, tapas, we enjoyed a selection of beef skewers (anticuchos), chicken and pork empanadas, spicy garlic shrimp (gambas al ajillo), and bread.  The coffee is flavorful, from Cave Creek's Roastery.  All our selections were tasty,  and the service was friendly and prompt!  They have plenty of parking,  and a full bar.  Mary was very helpful with recommendations.  Consider dining here if you are in the area.

The Paella Valenciana caught my eye,  serving two plus, I have made a reservation for dinner later this week."}
{"text":"Loves the small plates. We tried several different plates & all were good. Loved the empanadas, lamb & shrimp. Sampled the wine & tequila, all good & reasonably priced. The large bar in the center of the restaurant is big enough to seat a lot of people & feel  like you are right in the middle of the action. Entrees:  salmon & the ribs are worth a try. We will be back to sample more of the menu. This is exactly what Carefree needs, a hip modern restaurant not seen anywhere in Carefree or Cavecreek. Hip & modern with great food."}
{"text":"I have been a merchant in this town for 18 years.  I have seen restaurants come and go,  for various reasons; in fact the old restaurant in this location closed without any preamble.  I must say we were pleasantly surprised at the marvelous renovation of the rather dated space. We were  quickly greeted by the owner, Joe, and got the update on the great menu and enjoyed several small plates, the mussels were amazing.  Even though the members of our party  were pretty full after enjoying the small plates we went for gold and ordered entrees.  Wonderful, all of them! Lot of leftovers!   We have been back 8 times since our first encounter and it will continue to be our go - to restaurant in town."}
{"text":"Very disappointed at the service. If you have to wait 30 minutes for a drink the first time around then give it a 2nd chance and wait 37 minutes there's a serious problem especially when it really wasn't busy both times Food marginal at best. 

What killed me was we were sitting next to the owner of the tiny shopping mall where Bican was and their drinks were at the table within a few minutes. Then hearing me complain the owner of the mall came up to me saying that I should give this place a chance, I almost lost it at that point. Finally the owner came to our table and apologized. 

Unless this place does a 360 and fast the little mall owner will have another vacancy on his hands. I'm a local and value not only good food but great service... This place lacked both. I rarely give bad reviews but until they learn that getting drinks to the table within minutes is a priority and also the relevance of good quality food it's just a matter of time before this place gets into real trouble.

I'd love to see these guys make it but they have to be better prepared with a reserve wait staff and a much faster bartender. Also spend $100 a night and get an expediter(spotter)to relieve any issues. Little did they know that I am a 3rd gestation in the food and hospitality business in New York and Chicago. The place certainly has the potential of being great as the upstairs seating area has wonderful views. A bit of tweaking and you guys are on the way."}
{"text":"When our good friends told us that our favorite Spanish tapas restaurant was back in business after 10 years being away, we were excited to go back and check it out.  Nestled in Spanish Village in Carefree, is the newly remodeled Bacan with the same chef/owner Joe Viher and his amazing food.  Know for his authentic Paella's, tapas and Spanish cuisine he has taken his new restaurant to the next level.  The fresh and updated decor with old world charm just adds to the foodie experience and will keep you coming back to try everything on his menu.  The empanadas were outstanding as were the shrimp, salmon, black bean soup and the other tapas we all devoured.  Make the trip out to Carefree to experience the closest you will get to eating the best Spanish food outside of Madrid.  Added bonus:  the roof-top dining patio with views over the valley!"}
{"text":"Dinner for four last night. Beautiful views from the upstairs terrace. Lynn, our server, was delightful. Two shrimp small plates, gazpacho with crab claws, all delicious. The remodel of the interior is lovely. We hope Bacán does well and has a long life in Carefree."}
{"text":"Food was very good and good prices.  Took way to long to put in a drink order and it wasn't very busy. Never a welcome or thanks by any management staff.  Nice venue with good food, hope hospitality improves."}
{"text":"Tough night for this place. Both wines we ordered they were out of. My husband ordered the ribeye medium rare and was served a new York rare. Sent it back only to be served medium. My sea bass was very good. It didn't help that we sat for nearly 10 minutes before we got someone's attention to wait on us.  Never did any management representative come over to our table to intervene.  Poor management, poor staff training....just a poor experience. We will not return."}
{"text":"Great food!  Although they forgot to put the simple syrup in my drink.  The rice is unbelievably good and the ribeye with the slightly sweet sauce is one of the best steaks I have had all time. Overall you can tell they are new and working on things..the lighting in the place needs work just way too bright, but lots of potential overall."}
{"text":"This newly opened restaurant is a great little gem in Carefree! I had the sea bass, my wife had the chicken dish - both great dishes. The space is simple and classy - the servers are friendly and very accommodating. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"It's a breathtaking view from the patio upstairs, and the menu is great (everything looks delicious), but the food didn't quite live it up to it. Not bad... just not great. The mussels were rather bland and I'd say the same about the paella (which I was super excited about). Good drinks though. The staff is not al that knowledgeable or helpful, but it seemed as though there was simply not proper training. That's not a good look.
I wanted to give this place 5 stars, but the food didn't allow for such. Again, not bad... just not as good as I wanted it to be."}
{"text":"Went to Bacán for brunch. Our group tried the avocado toast, huevos rancheros and rabanada (a Brazilian French toast). The eggs were perfectly cooked, avocado was flavorful with hints of lime, which married perfectly with the salty cojita cheese. Sitting outside on the beautiful courtyard only added to the fabulous dining experience. 

If your looking for a sweet treat get the rabanada!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant in Carefree. Small plates are excellent. Main courses are well done but lack imagination. Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Despite mixed reviews we decided to try this place out. We were seated at the rooftop bar and had excellent service! The food was also very good, Cubano sandwich, chicken empanada, pork carnita tacos and calamari tacos. Excellent guacamole. Our server was the bartender, Pam, who was terrific! Said it was her 3rd day there. I'd definitely go back and look for Pam. Also if you go to the rooftop you might want to let the bartender at the main bar inside know that you'll be up there.  We were the first so we're glad we saw Pam inside before we went up. Definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent place...they let us sit on the patio and accommodated our every wish..Empanadas and garlic shrimp was awesome. Bread pudding killed it. Our waiter Johnny was awesome as well. Can't wait to come back...and the views..wow.."}
{"text":"We watched the Bacán renovation and couldn't wait until they opened! We came for their first lunch service and sat on the upstairs patio on a gorgeous day. 
The service was great, very friendly staff! The food was delicious. We had the jicama spring rolls, ceviche, and Cuban sandwich with fries. Do yourself a favor and get a side of aioli to dip your fries and cubano  
I can't wait to try the happy hour specials and dinner menu! There's soooooo many other things I want to try on the menu!! 
Definitely come here to support a fantastic new locally owned and operated biz!!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic new restaurant in Carefree!! Went with my family for dinner and absolutely loved the lamb appetizer and Chilean salmon for my main- a must try. The chic new look makes this spot a great place for any occasion! Can't wait to go back to try their brunch too."}
{"text":"How you get 4 stars, when the salad is more like soup, the class of wine was poor,and at $15 ( the same price as a bottle of this colored water)
Please don't misunderstand, I did not have a good experience, my with said she liked her bean soup...."}
{"text":"Second time there and all of us didn't like the food. Service is horrible to say it kindly. $12 burger with no side. Frozen spring rolls,  and a salad on the menu that didn't list that is has meat in it. Waiter brought us straws that were literally rolling around on his serving tray and then placed them on our table. Hey owner spend the money on straws that are wrapped in paper. And waiting 20 min for drinks is a bit much when you have a bar next to our table. Maybe you could open the bar for at least water. Wont be back."}
{"text":"Such a beautiful roof top patio with a fantastic happy hour menu with great prices. The decor is classy and beautiful. I recommend the pork tacos and the ahi burger. Sooooo good! Happy and professional staff!"}
{"text":"Went on a slow weeknight and was happy to have a chance to sit on the rooftop terrace for dinner. Nice views and cool breeze made it a perfect place to enjoy dinner and drinks. Tried several small plates, all of which were great. The gambas were delicious and filling. The empenadas were flaky on the outside and filled with savory chicken. Sauces for all the plates were also very good. Service was friendly and unobtrusive. Would recommend for a nice meal out, dinner with friends and family or for out of town guests. Kid menu is plentiful with choices as well for those with little ones. Look forward to trying brunch there one of these days."}
{"text":"Went for again Happy Hour on a Fri night. Limited Happy Hour food/drink menu & it really isn't Happy Hour pricing. $12-$15 Happy Hour drinks! Server kept going down stairs to the bar for our drinks vs having them made right there at the upstairs bar. Did not have the correct cherry to make a Manhattan, no blue cheese olives (but then they found some 2 drinks later). Have been here 3 times as we would really like to see the place survive through the summer but we won't be back and not sure it can survive the summer. Bummer.
There are better Happy Hours in town, we'll go there. Sorry but we tried."}
{"text":"Great food, loved the decor and the outdoor seating. Waiters were attentive and personable...."}
{"text":"It was my first time to Bacán Restobar, I brought a friend that lives in Carefree! We both love outdoor dining and I had noticed the reviews for Bacán in Yelp raving about the patios! Located in the Spanish Village area of Carefree, it has a Darling entry area that has decorative art! The place was empty but we were dining at 1pm on Wednesday. Our server Ed was very attentive and helpful with suggestions on things to share! We ordered the crab with gazpacho soup, empanadas and Spicy Garlic Shrimp!! It was all very delicious and flavorful! I also had a refreshing cocktail that was tart/sweet with grapefruit! The Paloma Squeeze was delicious! Our seating on the covered patio had views of the surrounding garden area. We strolled upstairs and the views there were outstanding!! My one issue was the total was a bit surprising $71 for Lunch!! Two cocktails and three small plates was a bit dear for a lunch date, but that being said it was an enjoyable time so money well spent! Thank you Bacán I will return for the outdoor music on the weekend!!"}
{"text":"I so wanted to love this place but it wasn't to be. The spicy garlic shrimp and ceviche were awesome. We then asked the bartender what else was wonderful and he recommended the lamb chops. I love lamb so OK!!  They were so gamey tasting I couldn't eat them so the bartender said \"oh sorry and I recommended them\". He then took them to the back. When he returned he was chewing and I joked about him eating them and he pretty much admitted he did. Ok, no prob. 

Got the bill and the lamb was still on there and he wouldn't take it off. His reply was \"well, I guess I can ask the manager if you want\" and was hesitant. How ridiculous?!?!  I just paid the bill and won't be back. I bought dinner for myself, my friend and $17 lamb for the bartender. Bad service had killed many a good potential restaurant. Damn! I'm so bummed about this new place :-("}
{"text":"Bacán just opened a couple of days ago in the old location of Carefree Station, in the Spanish Village near the Sundial in Carefree.

First impression---this looks like nothing like Carefree Station!  They did a beautiful remodel, and although everything is painted white, they managed to find the perfect warm white, and that with a judicious use of wood and ambient lighting makes a cozy and contemporary spot for dinner.  And DH, with his bad back, said the seating is VERY comfortable!

The waitstaff is great, from the hostess who accommodated us when we said the first table at which she seated us was under a music speaker and was too noisy to the excellent and personable service provided to us during dinner.  

We started with drinks.  DH got a Willemette Valley merlot that was quite good. I ordered one of the specialty cocktails, the Arcadia, which is cucumber-infused vodka, muddled blueberries and mint, and sparkling water.  It was delicious, although I could not taste the blueberries.  The second Arcadia tasted much more of blueberries. It was also delicious!  So refreshing.  Maybe not the perfect cocktail for a chilly AZ night, but I am already anticipating enjoying many more on the rooftop bar this summer!

Since this was our first visit, we started with three small plates: the empanadas, the picadillo, and the ceviche.  The picadillos were soooo good.  Spicy beef hash and cheese and avocado in lettuce cups, DH and I both agreed we could each have easily cleaned up our own plate of them!  Delicious!  The empanadas were quite good, fried nicely with a spicy pork filling, but they were a bit one note.  In fact, we asked for lemon slices so we could add a touch of brightness.  I kept wishing for a little bowl of ají to spoon over them.  I think that would have been perfection.  But they were nice and crisp with a savory interior.  The ceviche was...meh.  It was very dull and the sea bass did not stand up to the marinade well and had become sad and mushy.  Even a squeeze from our faithful lemon slices couldn't perk it up. (In the interest of honesty, I have to admit that any ceviche we try has to live up to the standard of that at Deseo at the Keirland Westin, which offers several outstanding ceviches.

Portions were VERY large---three healthy picadillo lettuce cups, four good-sized empanadas, and maybe 1/2-3/4 cup of ceviche.  Another comment---four thin slices of toasted baguette is not enough with that amount of ceviche.  We had to ask for more, which was a good thing.  We were brought half a loaf of hot bread and it was excellent!  DH was sure it was baked in-house.

We had intended to finish our meal by sharing a sandwich or entree but sadly, we were full after the three small plates.  (They had a nice dessert menu also).  

Special note: I mentioned to our server that the ceviche was mushy and I wasn't certain that sea bass was the right fish for a ceviche, and when she returned, she said she had spoke to chef and our next visit, to request the ceviche with the Ahi tuna.  Now THAT is customer service.  (I can tell I am going to love this place!)

Overall, a strong B+.  The kitchen was a bit slow, but to be expected in the first couple of days when a newly opened restaurant is finding its feet.  Waitstaff=excellent.  Food needs a bit of tweaking, but I have every confidence they are going to become a go-to destination in Carefree, just as its predecessor, Carefree Station was for so many years."}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour, appetizers are delicious, beautiful decor & lovely wait staff. I will be back to try the dinner menu!  Live music on the weekends.  Best Mule ever!"}
{"text":"I'm giving the restaurant 2 stars because they didn't have the wine I ordered which was on the menu, didn't have lemonade because the soda machine was not operational and didn't have Stella beer so suggested Miller light instead - Really?  On an early Saturday night already running out of beverages?  That's week.  I also observed them serving coke cans to customers - the least you can do is open the can and pour it as part of the service.  Better yet, do it at the bar before it's served.   The beverages overall took way to long to be served.  

The decor and ambiance is meeh.  Some Spanish artwork on the wall and white linen table cloths would make a big impact on the plain walls and brown tables.

The empanadas were ok; the paella was ok but also priced accordingly:  the sausage and chicken were too dry (dark meat would be a better choice), the rice was undercooked and it could use more saffron.  However, the seafood was fresh and delicious.

We will give Bacan another try and hope that with time they will implement some improvement.  I saw an amazing looking scallop dish being served that I must try."}
{"text":"Happy to see a new place in Carefree that will add to the choices out here for dinner.  The food was good, a few things were lacking, but the food was pretty good.  The paella is enough to feed four, and it was good but could be a little more flavorful.  We weren't offered a wine list and the waitstaff was good but pretty overworked.  She did as good a job as she could as they seem to be understaffed.  The bar area is nice and the place was pretty busy so it was lively.  We will go again for sure.  Nice addition to Carefree for sure."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed eating here with friends last weekend. Everything we tried was amazing but my favorite was a shrimp dish from the small plates menu. The sauce was AMAZING. We sat outside and the ambience was both comfortable and intimate. It definitely felt like we were somewhere special - out of town or on vacation. We met the chef/owner who is an absolute gentleman. I wouldn't hesitate recommending this spot to anyone."}
{"text":"Great new Johns! Service wa great, food good and views from rooftop was awesome! Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Nice place.  Went for happy hour and sat at the rooftop bar.  We were quickly greeted by the bartenders.  Very friendly and helpful.  Nice happy hour menu with a good variety of food and drinks.  I had the mojito which was really good.  Ordered chicken empanadas and the chicken skewers..... both very good.  While the drinks and food were very good it's the view from the rooftop bar that steals the show.  We would come back!!"}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE! We will be back here again. Everything we had was fantastic. Lamb chops were perfect, Andalusian (shrimp) fritters, spring rolls, and the Escalivada (eggplant, onion, and red peppers) were just incredible! Prices were reasonable and there is no doubt we will be back to try the Paella and other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour!  We have been here a couple of times and enjoy the upstairs patio for cocktails and small plates.  We've tried most of them and have never been disappointing.  The service is getting better but still needs improvement as does the prep of the main entrees - they tend to be overcooked.   Let's hope they get these two things right as we enjoy the atmosphere and would love to see this Carefree gem be successful!"}
{"text":"I returned during happy hour just recently.  Wonderful $5 Chardonnay, empanadas and wings.  Very well done.  Wish they extended to 6pm still but well worth getting there early."}
{"text":"Just had a fabulous dinner on their patio overlooking cave Creek and watched the setting sun. Food and service was great. We had horderves first and the sea bas was the best then moved on to the main course with their piaya and ribbs, both wonderful"}
{"text":"Big disappointment. We came here with a big group. When we showed up there was hardly anyone is the restaurant but the service was very slow to start. Our server seemed very uneducated in the wine selection. The appetizers came out and were very delicious but it went downhill from there. We didn't get our dinner for over an hour after ordering it and the reason was that the kitchen got really busy yet we ordered before there were a lot of people there. The place was clearly understaffed. They ran out of forks and couldn't even bring out extra bread for our table and the 5 year old we had with us who was starving. We also could never get the server or staff to refIll our water. We had to go to the bar and get a pitcher and pour our own water, which is crazy! Once we actually got the meal, the fish dishes were mediocre at best, which had little to no flavor. There were some good reviews about the meat dishes ordered and I tried a piece of steak which had some good flavor.  On the positive side, the restaurant has a very unique ambience to it and different from a lot of restaurants. After a 3 hour dinner, I will be sure not to come back or recommend. Very disappointing because I think this place has a lot of potential but from our experience and the high prices, unacceptable in my opinion."}
{"text":"Food & service were excellent. From what was understood, there were a few hiccups getting the restaurant open due to extensive restorations to make the restaurant the beautiful environment it is. Hard to believe it's one of the oldest buildings in the area with the renovations. The whole Spanish Village area has really transformed under the new ownership. Despite the few hiccups, this place has great potential. It's also got a killer patio with great views. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Beautiful remodel on a favorite location - friendly and efficient service albeit a few newbies (the restaurant opened recently) but nothing offed our evening.  Food was satisfactory - Paella could have been more spicy but the generous serving and generous supply of seafood more than made up.  Steak was sauced nicely.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Try the Paella Velenciana!!  The menu says it servers two, but our waitress said it was way more than that, so the four of us got a couple of appetizers to share and ended up with leftovers to take home. Pork Empanadas were just the right amount of spice and the deserts were very satisfying. 
Then head up to the roof for some live music and an after dinner drink!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  Really enjoyed the empanadas.  The paella was superb as was the spareribs.  Service was exceptional.  Definitely a place I will return over and over."}
{"text":"We tried Bacán for the first time this evening. The restaurant is located in Spanish Village in Carefree.  The decor is very attractive. We decided to share a number of the small plates for dinner. We tried pork empanadas, garlic shrimp, beef skewers and Nuevo spring rolls. The portions were definitely large enough for two to share, and each dish was excellent. The entire staff was very welcoming and friendly. A great addition to Carefree! We will definitely be back. So much to try."}
{"text":"I hosted a dinner of nearly 60 people here last night. The night could not have been more perfect. We had a buffet of ribs, chicken, green beans and scalloped potatoes; wow! The meal was exceptional. The service was perfect. Most of us dined on the patio with a nice cool breeze making the evening delightful. The owner Joe was very accommodating to our large party. We were served, in and out in less than two hours. Thank you for an incredible evening."}
{"text":"We dined here Sat when we had excellent food and service; then we brought another couple tonight (Mon) and found the food to be definitely lacking even tho the service was still good.  I had exactly the same menu item both nights and tonight's serving I would not recommend nor order again.
There were extremely few diners at the restaurant tonight so don't go on a Mon until they get some consistency."}
{"text":"Excellent food and wonderful drinks!  Live entertainment on the weekends!  Old Carefree station location. Check it out!!!!"}
{"text":"This was a disappointing dinner.I chose the plantain encrusted Seabass. It was a nice piece of fish however I didn't detect any plantain taste or see a plantain. My friends had scallops and were not impressed. Service was so so and the wine by the glass list was very limited. We had expected more from this new opening in Carefree."}
