{"text":"Good people, good food, good atmosphere = recipe for a great time!!!!  With that said, from the sports bar to the dining area to the menu to the staff to the price, etc.....you can't go wrong!!!!  I HIGHLY recommend this establishment for any occasion!"}
{"text":"Very run of the mill. We tried a bit of everything. Boneless chicken wings are basically something you could bake at home from a bag of frozen chunks and cover with some marzetti honey mustard dressing. Potato skins, pizza, and calzone were all ok, but much greasier than necessary. Staff was pleasant but I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"After talking with Dean, everything seems to be going great.  When there is a mistake, he fixes it promptly.  The drivers are always courteous and very nice!  Love their food and the fact that they will adjust the menu to what the customer wants.  Thanks Dean!  You know I'm a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"Great food. We always order delivery and it's quick with nice delivery drivers. One even had biscuits for our dogs! My husband loves all the pasta dishes as he's tried each one. He loves that it comes with salad and garlic bread. We like the wings (cheesy mild and Szechuan are our faves). My favorite sandwich is the corned beef fattie. Best pizza is New York and Bianca. Their menu is varied so there is something for everyone."}
{"text":"I've never actually ate in Dominic's, but I've been getting take out for twenty years. I worked at a place in town that ordered out from them every day. Around 2005 we had some problems with service and said Dominic's sucks. Dominic's is like an old love after you don't have it for sometime you really miss it.  There pizza is one of the best in town. Real good crust with a thick well seasoned sauce. The cheese could be a bit heavier. I absolutely love there cheeseburger pizza.  It has pickles mustard and ketchup on it. There jojo's are some of the best I've ever had. The godfather burger is real good. The French fries are horrible at least for take out. They are loaded with grease. If you get fried fish with fries the fries taste like the fish.  I've had a lot of different food there over the years. You just got to find what you like.                                                     
    The fried chicken is good to."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for take-out. The pizza is fantastic! A good pizza should have cooked toppings evenly scattered over the whole pie and a layer of cheese all over. I absolutely love the pizza here!
 It's usually delivered hot unless they are real busy. 

The resturant itself isn't very big, and can fill up fast on weekends. Parking can be tough being next to apartments but if you're determined and wait for someone to leave you'll do fine.

I eat here often and expect to keep doing so."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! My husband and I go their atleast once a week. We love their pizza! It is defientely the best in town."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.   The food is very good from appetizers to pizza to ribs.  The prices are very reasonable, along with a nice ambiance.  Their carrot cake is the best around.  I highly recommend trying this jewel."}
{"text":"This place is run by a family of assholes and idiots. They allow their entire staff to smoke weed while they're on the clock. They even have a shed in the back to allow their employees to smoke weed \"in private\". It's called the \"smokehouse\". Or, they can choose to get high on the back porch of the family owned house next door.

If you could see how they prep food in the kitchen, you would never eat here again.
- They leave their half-cooked ribs out for hours. I have personally seen dozens of flies completely cover these ribs on a daily basis.
- Their raw chicken is also left out in the HOT kitchen for hours. I truly can't believe that someone has not died after eating their chicken.
- When busy, their dishwashers help out by making salads. No gloves, no washing of hands... they go straight from washing dirty dishes to making salads.
- Half of their kitchen staff live at Cathy's House (a rehab in Medina that specializes in heroin addicts).

Eat there at your own risk. Scary shit going on behind the scenes at Dominic's/JoJo's."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!  Waited 20 minutes before someone took our DRINK order.  Ordered food then too.  Breadsticks never came until we asked 15 minutes later.  Waitress was extremely rude when we asked why the long wait.  Food came very late.  Will not be coming back.  Don't know what happened, but this place has gone downhill in the last couple years."}
{"text":"Decided to stay close to home and order a take-out pizza. Had heard good things about Dominic's from friends who have eaten there so I checked out their menu on-line. Found out that Monday and Tuesday is their pizza special day. For $6.99 you can get a one-topping, large pizza to go. Since it was Monday, I did.

I ordered my pizza with pepperoni. The large pizza is listed as 12 inches. Was told over the phone it would be 25 minutes but it actually only took 20. When I got it home I opened the box and saw that toppings covered nearly the entire pizza. I've become too used to getting pizza that has an inch and a half of edge crust that often gets uneaten and tossed. Not Dominic's. The pizza itself measured 11 1/2 inches, but there was only about a 3/8 inch edge crust that WASN'T topped, so that's more than acceptable. And the pizza lays on a piece of wax paper in the box, avoiding the cardboard taste that comes with it being plopped directly into the box.

Dominic's pizza is thin crust. A slight crunch to the bite, but soft inside. The sauce was applied liberally so you know it's there. I hate when some places seem like they apply it with a paint brush. One reason you buy pizza is for the sauce, so give me some! Speaking of which, the sauce is not overly spiced and has a nice tomatoey taste. That's the way I like it. Pepperoni was placed on top of the cheese and baked until almost crisp. Again, exactly how I like it. A little bit of grease, but not overly so. The only fault I could find is I would have appreciated more cheese.

A coupon on the box offers a buy 12, get one large one-topping pizza free. My advice is, if hungry for pizza on Monday and Tuesday, skip the $5.00-walk-in-always-ready pizza chains and go to Dominic's."}
{"text":"Ordered take out,  newer girl at the counter by the time she figured out our order the food was cold,"}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price. Nice restaurant. Check it out, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"First time ordering, last time ordering

Delivery 1/2 hour late 

Wings we ordered, grease leaked through the bag on to the top of our pizza box. 

Greeted to a half hour late, cold, disgusting pizza that tasted like rotten vegetables. I didn't know it was possible to make bad pizza. Even I can make one that tastes decent

Save your money or order Little Caesar's. I hate Little Caesar's but they are gourmet pizza compared to this place!"}
{"text":"Wow one of the worse service i have ever received by the staff. I stopped by on a Wednesday night to order a Pizza to go the counter staff that was ringing people,seating people, taking care of to go orders, etc Refused to take my order and ignored me like i was invisible even the buss boy that was handling the all the dirty dishes refused to help me.  

  No one should be denied or refused service or even ignore. This location is a waist of time and if they refuse to take my order or satisfy me as a customer then i will not return. Seems like everyone was being denied and ignored Wednesday night last week during my visit it was so bad they stopped taking to go order and the line kept forming out the door not seating anyone."}
{"text":"this was actually for Jo-Jo's Sports Bar and since we were just having lunch i didn't get to try much. that said, we got some wings and i had a meatball sub. 

the sub was good enough - though nothing special. 

the Szechuan wings weren't that great - think teriyaki but spicy - actually quite spicy. the Stingin' Honey Garlic wings, however, were delicious though really wet and messy.

i'd really like more of those wings cooked a little more and with maybe a little less sauce."}
{"text":"First time eating here and they had Excellent food! We had a party of 8 and the service was a little slow, but the server was still wonderful. We ordered pizza as an appetizer and every single one of us were amazed and fighting over the last piece. I ordered the Cajun Shrimp Alfredo and it was by far the BEST I have ever had. My husband and I recently moved to the Medina area and Dominic's will be our go to restaurant for sure. I wouldn't say it was 100% child friendly only because there is no changing table in the bathroom, but as I said before...the food is worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"Personally you could do better. The food is nothing special. What sucks is you hear all this hype on the pizza. But let me tell you, it taste like any frozen pizza. If you want pizza don't waste your time. Just order in"}
{"text":"We have lived in Medina for twelve years. Over the years, we have really enjoyed Dominics. But lately I have noticed that the quality of food and service has been declining. This evening, we ordered the fish special (8 piece bucket of fish, French fries, slaw & rolls $14.99). I realized, after I called, that I forgot to ask for tartar sauce and vinegar. So, I called back. The girl who answered the phone told me that the meal came with tartar but more would be extra. I asked her how much it came with. She said two cups. Two cups of tartar is not a lot for 8 pcs of fish. So I asked about vinegar. Any vinegar is extra. I paid with a card. I wasn't about to put tartar sauce and vinegar on my credit card, so I went without. So, my experience is alread soured before I have even taken a bite. We've noticed more and more nickel and diming from this restaurant recently. That combined with a decline in quality and service does not spell continued success. Beware, Dominics. The customer NEEDS to come first. Don't squander an opportunity on a few extra pennies."}
{"text":"My family has been ordering pizza from here so decades! Best pizza in medina. Can be a bit greasy so I usually blot the top of the pizza but I love the sauce so much. Great options besides pizza, love their meatballs too. The patio is great in the warm months but can be a little crowded and rowdy on Friday/Saturday nights."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food. Since leaving long island, NY this has been the BEST place to find a BY style pizza. We take my mother in law every time she visits. She LOVES the eggplant Parisian!  By far, our favorite Italian spot!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice with family and have not been impressed. Salad was ok and fries and main meal were cold. Server was was busy with big parties."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed.  Food is home cooked, all entres are well portioned, and service is very good.  It does not matter if you go to Dominics Pizza, JoJos Sports bar, or Dominics Italian Rest. you will be happy you went there.  A life long customer."}
{"text":"There are a few one-stars that are pretty harsh. I can't speak to their experience (of course), but we loved it. Fresh and hot with nice crisp crust. The parmesan wings needed just a bit more salt but good garlicy flavor and NOT fatty. The Pizza Margherita was not as advertised but when we mentioned it, they very kindly remade it. 

It was a little warm in the reastaurant but comfortable and inviting."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to eat here. The food is always great - I highly recommend the Stromboli. Each table gets homemade breadsticks as well. Gelato for dessert is a must and is the best around."}
{"text":"Great food. ORDER FROM HOME. No craft beer and HORRIBLE service. ONLY time I have left a 1cent tip. I was s server for years. Their delivery folk are THE BEST!"}
{"text":"Food was fast to the table and properly cooked. Waited about 10 minutes to get a table. Portions were good sized, and food tasted good. Had the Stromboli, daughter had a salad and my wife had the Rueben Calzone. Would try it again."}
{"text":"This is the best deal in the area. The food is excellent. I love their lasagna and the pizza. Look online before you go to see their specials, like $5 pizza night."}
{"text":"Dear Dominic's,

I don't see you nearly as much as I probably should. My family and I used to visit every Friday night when we lived in Medina, but now that we're in Akron....well, you're kind of out of the way. But, for American-style Italian food, you're still on top after all these years.

Came here before my doctor's appointment (which, I swore she was going to tell me I was dying, so I was a wee bit nervous), and the food was fantastic, the prices were pocket friendly (I was planning my own funeral, you see), and the service was courteous and prompt. 

I was always a big fan of your baked pastas, and you didn't let me down one bit. And there was plenty left from the lunch portion to take home and have another meal of it. Though, since my doctor delivered the good news that I'm *not* dying, I'll have to make it out here a bit more often.

XOXO,
Jennifer"}
{"text":"We don't typically eat a lot of pizza but when we do, Our family loves to order Dominic's! We typically order for delivery and it usually gets to the house at least 5 minutes before they say it will. Each delivery person has been friendly, prompt, and grateful. The pizza is delicious, as well as the large portion of lasagna that could easily feed 2 people. The Italian wedding soup is on point and the tiramisu does not disappoint! One of the greatest things about Dominic's is that they offer a wide variety of foods so you're not just stuck with Italian food if your with a group and just not feeling it. I have only eaten on the dining room a couple of times and each time was not impressed with the staff interaction and  friendliness with guests. The same for when I have ever picked up an order to go....it's almost like they are annoyed you are there. Parking is a hassle and a half if you are trying to eat at the restaurant especially if there is a sports game on. My one liner for this place is \"We like it for the food not for the people\"."}
{"text":"The lunchtime pizza buffet was sufficiently cheap and varied.  2-3 pizza choices, replenished regularly with new options, a warm pasta and breadsticks.  I sampled thicker and thinner crusts, and both were equally tasty.  I'm pretty sure it was $6-7 per person."}
{"text":"This place is great !!! Great place to bring the family or for date night ! Lots of tv's , great service , and yummy food !!! Well done !"}
{"text":"Came here after the Christmas place. Great food. Had the spaghetti with homemade meatballs. Really good lasagna, calamari and panini. Would come again!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat been going there for years pizza and wings and muscles are the bomb!
Sincerely 
Bubba dave"}
{"text":"Went here with a co worker while on business.

It was a cute little place. I found the food to be very cheap but also had a litel smaller portions. I ordered the cheese ravioli. It was enough to fill me up and it tasted pretty good. Nothing exceptional but very do able.

My whole dinner with drink was 11 bucks, not bad."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Loaded chili cheese fries - great. Calimari cooked perfectly. All you can eat fish friday was great for the wife. I had baked penne. The sauce was awesome. The gelato is to die for. Service was superb. We will make the hour drive back many times over."}
{"text":"For our date night last night, hubby and I started at Dominic's.  

It's the first time in two years we've ordered their food dine-in.  I'm pleased to see that, even after a major fire threatened the business, it is alive and well.  Nicole was our hostess and Michelle was our server.  They were both so nice and helpful!  

Our Hawaiian pizza was perfect (that buttery crust - oh man!) and the onion rings were okay.  It was the chipotle ranch dipping sauce that made our side order sing. The only downer to our meal were the complimentary breadsticks.  I am grateful they offer them right after you're seated, but sad that they taste like steamed dough.  It would be nice if they basted them with garlic butter and crisped them up in the oven. Maybe serve them with oil and balsamic vinegar or marinara?

Bright and cheerful, Dominic's is a pleasant place to spend Saturday night."}
{"text":"My wife & I don't complain very much. This place has really gone downhill the past few years. A few months ago, our delivery order was terrible. I emailed the owner, and he gave us a partial credit. A couple of months later I order a delivery lunch.  The 2 items I ordered were so salty. They were inedible. Last night, we order various items. My entire family wouldn't eat any of it. The fish and chips were so over cooked. There was 0 fish and only batter. Fries were burnt dry. Dominics:  3 strikes...u r out in my family's Medina takeout!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is relatively good for Ohio. I rate everything based on East coast/ny style.  Delivery service is nice and fast. Order always right"}
{"text":"New to the area so we gave this place a try, Everything was delicious! Honey mustard Cajun wings and pizza were on point."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, and lots of food options. 
The speggetti is awesome ! I think if ur interested in any of the pasta option, u would be amazed with the salad."}
{"text":"After our recent move to Medina, we are making strides in trying the local fare. Dominic's comes up as a nearby restaurant that delivers pizza, so we decided to try it.

We ordered one cheese, one pepperoni, and one sausage with black olives and mushrooms for delivery. Within 45 minutes, the pizza was at our door, hot and ready to go. The crust was just right and the taste was good, no complaints. It just wasn't the above average, knock your socks off pizza that I was hoping for. Alas, I'll keep looking."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza ideas. I highly recommend the Roman or the cheeseburger pizza. Chicken quesadilla is great as are the wings. Fish fry basket is decent."}
{"text":"Love this place good food reasonable prices. Sometimes service is a little slow"}
{"text":"Family has been coming here for a number of years. When I come up to Ohio to visit grandparents, this is the only restaurant we go to. Everything on the menu is good. On Friday they have an unlimited fish fry. Very friendly staff. There is a restaurant section , bar section and outdoor patio."}
{"text":"This place doesn't disappoint ..love their calzones , pizza and I tried the fiesta burger today it was delicious"}
{"text":"Good service. Good food.  Good draft beer selection. Very affordable. This place is exactly what's its suppose to be.. A reasonably priced family restaurant with good food and a few nice surprises."}
