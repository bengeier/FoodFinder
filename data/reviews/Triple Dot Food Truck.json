{"text":"If I could give this zero stars I would. Absolutely unacceptable.  My husband invited me out to eat with him during his lunch hour at his work complex where there was going to be an Argentine inspired food truck. As a person who has visited Argentina on multiple occasions I was very excited to eat traditional empanadas. So we stood in line for 20 minutes there was only maybe eight people in front of us there was no need for a line to move that slowly. Especially for a food truck. I noticed multiple people either being forgotten about or bringing back their order because it was wrong. We waited for an additional 40 minutes for our food.  By the time we got our food my husband's lunch break was over and we had to go back. So not only was the wait time ridiculous. But there was nothing close to a traditional empanada and everything came out Fried and greasy. Empanadas are supposed to be baked there's no reason why none of that food could've been prepped. It's not worth the wait I would never go to that food truck again."}
{"text":"Saw them in a local strip mall, thought I would check it out. Strangely, I stood in line for more then 5 minutes while the one person in front of me spoke with person running the order window about something unrelated to food or ordering. I interrupted the conversation to ask if I am supposed to order from her or the cook. She said from me, then returned to her conversation with the person in front of me for another 5 minutes. I decided this food truck was more interested in socializing then serving food, and questioned whether the food could be good if that were the case, moved on..."}
{"text":"Their customer service is sub-par.  I waited 15 minutes for a breakfast empanada.  The older man taking orders was soft-spoken and was the least bit enthused.  I found it to be very odd that when an order was ready, he wouldn't call the name of the person who ordered it.  He just starred at everyone.  The empanada was $3.50, piping hot, crispy, and had good flavor.  It was somewhat worth the wait, but for there only being 3 people in front of me. I would not expect to have to wait 15 minutes for an empanada.  Overall, this place was just okay, but has potential if their customer service improves."}
{"text":"Given this truck a second chance waited 30 minutes for my food the breaded chicken was burnt and the fries were ok. I did not want a refund because my lunch hour was already up. Really does it take this long to make fast food."}
{"text":"Very tasty empanada's. Apparently I have make this longer to count as a review. The truck looked nice and the lady taking my order was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Triple Dot's empanadas are by far some of the best food I have ever eaten.  They are consistently good.  I know some people have complained about customer service and wait times, I have had their food numerous times and have never had to wait long and they have always been very nice.  Even if I did encounter long wait times and rude customer service, I wouldn't mind, the food is so good it would be worth it."}
{"text":"I was on the hunt for homemade stroopwafels as a gift for my dutch boyfriend. I came across Triple Dot Food Truck online and although they didn't have any public events going on in December, Alex was kind enough to make a batch for me and even deliver them on Christmas Eve! The service was phenomenal and the stroopwafels were a huge hit! Thank you so much Alex!!"}
