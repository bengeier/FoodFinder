{"text":"We visited this restaurant for Phoenix restaurant week and it was fantastic. It has an upscale interior and lots of patio seating. We shared the pork belly, heirloom tomato and watermelon salad, short ribs with Brussels sprouts and polenta, strawberry shortcake, and limoncello bread pudding. The pork belly was slightly overcooked but everything else was prepared very well and delicious. I also highly recommend the cream soda cocktail which tastes like a sweet old fashioned. Amazing. I would be a regular if I lived in the Chandler area."}
{"text":"Went during reststaunt week.  The avacado deviled eggs were good.  I had s musroom pasta dish which was divine.  For desert oatmeal cookies....delish.  I'd go back.  Nice outdoor patio.  Quiet and private."}
{"text":"Went to Earnest late on a Friday night with my Father on a visit from the northeast. The young lady by the door greeted us almost like lost friends and we quickly found ourselves sitting on the patio - by the ever present heaters. They were welcome that night!
The sounds of the indoor crowd mixed with the music, yet we were able to carry on conversation without much trouble. 
While I was tempted with the Sea Bass entree I opted for a seared tuna appetizer well seasoned on a bed of scallions, arugula and just the right amount of oil.

The entree of choice was the  braised boar shoulder risotto with mushrooms, peas, lemon, parmesan, and a healthy portion of herbs. It was excellent - the risotto was firm and tender - with no hint of stickiness. The blend of the boar, mushrooms and peas complimented each other.

Dad had the cider-braised pot roast on a bed of spaghetti squash and butternut squash puree on the side. The roast had been cooked in a cider jus that was very tasty. He thoroughly enjoyed it.

Wine was by the glass and the Cab was rich and full bodied.

Earnest is on his list to return after I have returned home."}
{"text":"We arrived at seven p.m. and didn't finish until eight thirty.  Most of our time was waiting for everything we ordered from drinks, to olives, to the main meal.  The wait staff was pleasant and helpful.  We had the short ribs and the pork chops.  The latter was the better of the two.  The short ribs were tender but not very flavorful, nor was the pasta under the meat.  The air conditioner fans were so powerful and cold, the food was cold before we could finish eating.  For two glasses of wine, one appetizer and two main course meals, the $100 tab was not worth it."}
{"text":"Just delicious. Love he new kids menu items....my kids crave the brussel sprouts, when does that EVER happen?!  I really think the banana cream pie is one of the best and non traditional."}
{"text":"We ate here last night and it was the 2nd time we've dined there since they re-vamped from \"Cork\".  The first time we were there a couple of months ago we had to wait way too long for hamburgers and the excuse from the waiter was, \"we're short handed in the kitchen\".  Hmmm.....only about 4 tables had customers. Last night, 9/15, we went for an anniversary dinner. My meal, hangar steak, was ordered medium and it came out very rare and cold in the middle. It got sent back, and it came out about 8 minutes later the same, only slightly more done. By this time my husband and child were almost done eating. I sent it back again, and it came out cooked properly but the garnishes were dry and basically substandard. We got the same answer from our waiter...\"we are short handed in the kitchen\".  The manager came out and apologized profusely but my evening  was ruined by this point. They tried appeasing me with a half pour more of the wine I ordered.  They removed the entree off our bill and gave me a coupon for money off our next meal there. Won't be a next time. Beware....you never know when you're serving another food professional who knows the game. . You lost great customers and everyone we know. Sorry. And it was a special evening."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a nice dinner here recently. We had the pork belly appetizer and chicken with Brussels sprouts (which were amazing) and a great dessert. My only critique was that the pork belly was dry- I'm used to a braised pork belly. The service was great! The chef came out and was smiley and nice, Scott and Jessica were both pleasant and knowledgable as well."}
{"text":"1st class service, excellent cocktails, delicious deserts.
I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"This place is firing on two of four cylinders.  Food excellent; Vibe cool; Service surprisingly bad; Prices surprisingly high.  Showed up with two adults and three kids at 6:45.  Food arrived at 7:45.  Total bill was $107 even with free kids meals.  There are dozens of other family restaurants where we would have had a better experience for half the price."}
{"text":"The lamb meatballs are amazing! The house made snickers bar is to die for and I don't think I can ever have banana cream pie without an Oreo crust from now on!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Earnest for AZ Restaurant Week and we highly recommend it!  We went on a Tuesday night which happens to be their 1/2 off select bottle of wine night.  Our waiter was friendly and quite knowledgeable about the wine list and recommended a Cabernet Franc (Les Pensées de Pallus 2011) that was unusual and delicious. For the first course I had the Fall Chopped Salad which was quite large and tasty.  My husband had the Oysters Rockefeller which was beautifully plated.  For our entrees I had the Cider-Braised Pot Roast which was on the dry side but the cheddar mashed potatoes were amazing.  My husband had the BBQ Pork Belly which he enjoyed.  For dessert we both had the cinnamon bread pudding which came in these cute mini cast iron pots. The creme fraiche ice cream on top was good but didn't mix that well with the last of our wine.

This restaurant may be a bit out of the way for anyone who doesn't live in the SE Valley but living in Tempe, it didn't take much longer than going to DT PHX.  And you don't have to worry about the lack of parking!"}
{"text":"Simply delish! Great food, highly recommend the pork chop as a standout, and the banana cream pie was divine! Ask for Scott as your server!"}
{"text":"Wow this place was incredible! I love the decor...but let's get to the good stuff. We started with an appetizer special of salami and goat cheese. It was a good choice. They also haf a special of venison chops. They were cooked to a perfect medium rare and paired perfectly with my wine. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place was featured as one of the top 15 places to eat in Phoenix. I was ranked as #5, I would rank it as #1. Great atmosphere and staff. Check this place out, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"The food was good, service was fair.
Server seemed annoyed with serving us. When asked about bread service, he mentioned we could purchase bread. Really??? I didn't feel compelled to buy their wine or look at their dessert menu at that point. Take care of your guests! Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"We never did try cork but made it to Earnest recently.  We loved the atmosphere, the interior decor is minimalist, modern and beautiful.   
The food is imaginative and very well prepared.  
Servers were very knowledgable and well trained. 
All in all, it is a Scottsdale type dining experience in 
South Chandler.  You will pay a little more but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience all around.  Food was very good and the service was equally very good.  We had the monkey bread and lamb meatballs for appetizers (both wonderful), my wife had the ribs with pork belly while I had the cider-braised pot roast, both of which were tender and flavorful,  

We will definitely be back and would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys great food with great service in a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! Went early and had a couple of drinks at the bar. Their deviled eggs are amazing. For dinner, my wife and I shared their daily risotto and the pork chops. Both were delicious. We definitely plan on going back to sample more of their menu."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Earnest ... a local spot, just down the street.  Found the service painfully slow.  The expertly prepared pork chop made up for a salty chickpea appetizer.  Make sure you have time for an extended dinner."}
{"text":"It's New Year's Eve. Earnest has a special (and expensive) three course dinner. Our group of 11 has reservations at 6pm. We arrive on time and are pleasantly greeted and seated. From that point on, the night was a disaster.

We waited for somebody to take our drink orders while we perused the menu. At 6:30 we sent one of our party out to search for a waiter. By 6:45 our waiter finally came to our table. We ordered wine which came just before 7pm. We've been at Earnest now for one hour and we have wine.

The waiter took our orders. This should have been relatively easy as the menu was a fixed three course dinner with few options. By 7:45, we have our entrées, except the start to our special meal is delayed as one of the orders delivered was the wrong entrée.

By 8:15pm we have our desserts, except one of the orders was wrong and so we waited again in order that we could all enjoy together. We ordered a few after dinner cocktails.

At 8:20 a woman (whom I suspect was the manager; she didn't introduce herself) tells us that we must leave the table as there is another party with a reservation waiting for it. Nobody has finished their cocktails, yet we are summarily escorted outside to the cold patio where we shivver and sip. The manager had the patio heaters immediately turned on, but by the time they were producing any heat, we had finished our cocktails.

The food was very good, but they just couldn't seem to get anything to our table in a timely manner. Because they delayed every service, we found ourselves rushed out before we even finished our meal, as if any part of this mess could be blamed on us.

When our checks arrived, those who ordered an after dinner cocktail had the drink removed from their bill, and that was a nice gesture. But half of our party did not have an after dinner drink. As a final insult, a 20% gratuity was included in the check because we were a party of eleven. In my opinion, it would have been more gracious (and honest) to charge for the cocktails and remove the gratuity.

Anyway, I'm in no hurry to return to Earnest and if anybody in our group suggests going there in the future, I will suggest that we pick another place."}
{"text":"Tried Earnest for the 1st time on Wednesday.  It was also my husband's birthday.  We were seated upon arrival and there were a few other tables occupied.  Our waiter was attentive and brought us water and the drink menu.  The waiter explained the price fixe menu as well as a Summer Seasonal menu that included salad, choice of protein and a S'more style dessert.  Being a fan of S'Mores, I knew what I was going to order.  Waiter asked if we had dined there before, we said no and I mentioned it was my husband's birthday, which the waiter acknowledged.  We ordered a bottle of wine along with our dinner.  My husband ordered the short rib stroganoff and I opted for the Summer seasonal with Salmon as my protein.  The waiter explained that sauteed mushrooms and other veggies came with it.  I do not like mushrooms and asked if they could be left off or put in a separate dish.  He said he would see what he could do but also offered a substitution.  I said brussel sprouts would be fine.  Dinners came, mine with mushrooms mixed with the other veggies.  Thankfully, they were large pieces and I was able to give them to my husband.  At no time did the waiter acknowledge anything about the mushrooms.  As our meal went on, he became less attentive.  The salmon and veggies were a bit salty for my tastes. My husband was very happy with his dish.  Once we were finished, the waiter brought a dessert menu to my husband.  He declined to order anything.  Then the waiter brings out my S'Mores dessert  with a lit candle in it.  As he sets it on the table he says \"I know this is technically for you but thought I would put a candle in it for him.\"  What??!? How cheesy is that????  I get my husband isn't 6 and doesn't need the entire place to sing him happy birthday but they couldn't even give him a slice of cake or something for a birthday dessert???  There are so many places out there that do such a thing for special occasions.  After spending over $115 on dinner and wine, the least they could have done was thrown in a dessert.  The worst part was the S'More dessert sucked.  It was ice cream with a toasted marshmallow, which turned hard, on top and globs of hardened hot fudge.  I needed a knife to eat it.  Needless to say, one and done.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here on a Saturday night for happy hour. The food was amazing and so worth the price. We ordered quite a few appetizers off the happy hour menu; we thought because the prices were so low we'd get tiny portions. We were wrong! I got the deviled eggs and fried green tomatoes, my boyfriend got the pork ribs and pork belly grilled cheese, and we shared the Parmesan fries. The portions were substantial, and the food was delicious. The deviled eggs weren't too mustard-y and the fried green tomatoes were crispy and came with a tomato pesto dipping sauce that I ended up eating with a fork because it was so good on its own. The fries were cooked perfectly, not too greasy. My boyfriend was very happy with his food too, it looked great but I didn't try it because I don't eat meat. They have great deals on drinks, beer on tap for $2/glass. I had a glass of house red, the daily cocktail ( a vodka pineapple drink), the American Cream Soda, and a carajillo. The American Cream Soda was strong and just sweet enough. The carajillo was a perfect after dinner drink. The service was good, attentive and friendly. I loved the decor and atmosphere of the place, it was very comfortable. For five appetizers and six drinks we paid just under $80 including tip. I'm very impressed, such a good price for very very good food and drink! We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Wednesday night to take my parents out to eat for their anniversary. I'll start off with the food. The food was PHENOMENAL. It was flavorful and rich. That being said, the service was horrible. When we walked in it took them forever to just seat us. Once we were seated it literally took them about 7 minutes for our server to greet us and get us drinks. Once we ordered drink, of course we waited another 7 minutes just for water glasses. Aside from one other small family, we were the only other family there (5). We had to wait a long time for our drinks and our food and check. 
Again, service was horrible and not worthy paying so much money on food for. However, if that doesn't bother you, the food is amazing and tasteful"}
{"text":"Well, this place is ok. Definitely not my type. First, I had limited choices on the menu. They had a lot of pork or bacon options and I don't eat pig.... So my choice was limited and I picked the Alaskan cod with mushroom and dinner other veggies... First it took quite a bit to get the food, and then when the food came the portion was literally a baby portion of food. A 10 yrs old kid eats more than that... Check the pic. Will not go waste my money at another earnest restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"Amazing food, excellent service.   We had our anniversary dinner at Earnest.  It was a great atmosphere for our evening out.   

My husband had the buffalo brisket.  It came with bratwurst.  Very good!!!  I had the pork belly and ribs.  It was also very good.  

Can't wait to go back and try dessert.  Breaking pudding with home spun ice cream sounds Ah-mazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Exceptional experience! Beautiful interior and patio, nicely crafted kids meals and outstanding dishes. Tried pretzel appetizer, delicious! Had the pork rib chop for entree, perfectly executed. Juicy, tender, a modern interpretation of a creamy potato casserole, terrific. Nicely done!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to The Earnest a few times since it opened. We have always been very pleased with the food quality. Menu is somewhat limited. However, it tends to change frequently, which provides variety. The restaurant's decor is warm and modern. The only reason I do not give it five stars is due to the timeliness of the kitchen. We have been there both on the weekend and during the week and I always feel like our entrées take a very long time to come out. Otherwise the service is great."}
{"text":"Ack! Yelp! You deleted my whole review when I logged in!

Anyway, to start this is in the boonies - Sun Lakes - but it was worth the drive.

To start - we ordered the avocado BLT deviled eggs with arugula, scallions, cherry tomato, bacon lardons. The yolks were mixed with avocados which is a nice substitute or addition to the normal mayo for deviled eggs. We also ordered the zucchini cakes with crab, pickled onion, asparagus, Champagne hollandaise. The zucchini was crispy and soft at the same time, lots of flavor and awesome with the crab and the hollandaise. Definitely worth it. 6 eggs came with the order and two large zucchini cakes - so plenty for all.

For dinner, I had the pan-seared airline chicken breast with bacon & rosemary grits, heirloom cauliflower, rapini, mushroom brandy sauce. I really liked the flavor of the grits with the combination of the mushroom brandy sauce. Very different and savory.

My friends ordered the double-cut, bone-in, pork \"ham\" chop with apple sauce, sausage & cheddar potato \"casserole\". Holy cow (or pig!) This this is huge. I would definitely say that it's good to split for 2. All of my friends loved this - as they said it was a good combination of the pork chop and \"ham\". But it is indeed huge.

Worth the trip out to the middle of grey-hairville for sure. They also have a large wine selection, so would be good just to meet friends out for a wine happy hour.

I would say there was a definite gap in service as we finished the appetizers before we even ordered our main entrees and drinks were empty - but the server was friendly which kind of made up for it. Other than that, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what the fuss us all about here. The food is good but a little over the top. It's nice option to not have to go to scottsdale for this type of food but I don't really want to pay scottsdale prices for a restaurant in a strip mall.

The decor is really nice but the iPad drink menu was more annoying than helpful. 

Everything we ordered was good and  I liked having two options for sparkling wine by the glass."}
{"text":"Cute place, but $25 for cod and $15 for a burger is excessive in the far burbs.  Well, interesting to see that the place closed.  Guess others agreed that $15 is a bit pricey for a burger in south Chandler.  I paid less than that in New York."}
{"text":"My husband and I have lived in Seattle and Minneapolis and eaten in wonderful restaurants all over the country and Earnest rivals some of the finest cuisine we have experienced. It has a relaxed atmosphere and don't let the location scare you... It is amazing and the homemade desserts are out of this world... Danielle's candy and banana cream pie are my favorites and for entrees the pork ham chop is awesome! The staff is super friendly and honest with recommendations. We can't say enough good things about this restaurant and staff."}
{"text":"Great service, excellent food.  This was formerly Cork, and recently re-opened as Earnest.  I never went to Cork, but may come back here again.  We had three appetizers - lamb meatballs, prosciutto (wasn't on the menu, was a special that night), and mac and cheese.  All three were great.  My wife had the salmon, I had the buffalo brisket, both were great as well.  Good wines too, I definitely recommend visiting here and trying for yourself."}
{"text":"Went there for happy hour last night. Amazing! We had the pork belly grilled cheese, parmesan fries and roasted brussel sprouts. Everything was delicious. I have always hated brussel sprouts but I am now a convert. I would go back just for those alone. Happy hour is a great deal. Drinks are a little limited but we mostly went for the food so we did not mind. Definitely recommend for anyone who likes interesting food. Best bar food I have ever had."}
{"text":"The inside is adorable - chic but charming.  Cocktails are presented on an ipad which is kinda nifty but requires you to ask the waitress for it again when ready for a second.  We started with the sea salt rolls, fried brussel sprouts and mac n' cheese.  

The sea salt rolls were very tasty but it seems like something that should be free (instead of $3).  

The brussel sprouts were OUT OF THIS WORLD.  And as a side, it's a HUGE serving so if you were so inclined (and perhaps spending the evening alone afterward), you could make it your meal.  

The mac n' cheese was very tasty although the \"bacon\" was more like rubbery bits of ham.  They're large enough that you can pick around them (as I did) but I vote for nixing them altogether.  

The pan fried chicken with grits was delicious.  Chicken was well seasoned and expertly prepared (note that it does come with a bone for the bone-averse folks).  The grits were very tasty but a bit rich for me.  Husband loved them.  

Even though culinary death was imminent, we went for broke and ordered the banana pie.  Let me just say - I do not like pie.  I like pie filling but you can have your soggy floppy crust.  This is NOT \"regular pie.\"  It has a cookie crust topped with banana pie-ness and toasted marshmallow.  I know the combination sounds iffy but it's good.  Trust me.  Take a piece home if you can't possibly stuff your facehole with it after dinner."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! To begin with, our waiter (I wish I could remember his name.) was the best waiter I think I've ever had. He was so nice and went out of his way to make our experience great. The food was fantastic!  We had the short rib, which was perfectly cooked and not at all fatty. We also had the Brussels sprouts, and they were delicious.  And as for the banana cream pie, next time I will make my hubby get his own because it's just too good to share!

Edit:  After I posted this earlier today, we decided to go here for dinner tonight with family to celebrate birthdays. Tonight's visit was more like two stars. Our server was nice, but we were there forever.... They took so long to bring the food out. Our reservation was at 6:15 and we didn't get our meals until about 7:45. I was kind of embarrassed because I had raved about how great our experience was last time."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar for happy hour. They have a really good selection and great prices, but the food is super rich. We could barely eat a third of what we ordered. I was also dismayed by the behavior of one of the bartenders. He had long curly hair, and he kept pulling it in and out of a ponytail but he never once washed his hands after touching his hair. He also kept giving free samples of gin to people at the bar. He talked very loudly about how drunk he was all the time. I kept looking around for the manager wondering why this kid didn't get shut down."}
{"text":"I highly recommend giving Earnest a try. Everything is made from scratch and locally sourced. The food was delicious and in a great atmosphere too. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic time at Earnest!  Their cocktails were awesome but more importantly the food was on point. The highlight was the zucchini cakes with crab and a champagne hollandaise - spectacular. Would highly recommend for a date night!"}
{"text":"Have been 3 times since it opened and have been happy when I left. In the past week they have introduced a new happy hour menu which was needed. Many new choices at reasonable prices.  Food is excellent and service at the bar is great. Give it a try you will be happy."}
{"text":"This was my wife and my first time back to one of our old favorite restaurants in Phoenix - Cork which was reinvented as Earnest.  We decided to give it a try during restaurant week.  Ironically, it was a common theme with the neighboring tables who we met in fun conversations.  Earnest's restaurant week menu was reminicent of our beloved Cork.  All of the dishes we decided to try did not disappoint making for an enjoyable meal.  Carefuly doing the wine pairings as they provided full pours.  I was walk out straight but surely got a good night rest.  It was a pleasure to see the friendly faces of the servers we previously knew.  Unlike other previous reviews, the servers were spot on and did everything suppose to and more.  We definately will be back in the future to enjoy Earnest again.  Thank you to everyone at Earnest for yet another wonderful dinner."}
{"text":"We live in Chandler and went to Cork two or three times a year. I understand Earnest has the same chef. I have to say.... I LOVED Earnest and only just liked Cork. This new place has a much funner vibrant ambiance. Modern but comfortable at the same time.

And the food... oh man... my type of menu! It's a twist on comfort food. There is pot roast and pork chop on the menu. My husband had the pork chop and said it was incredibly tender. He loved the potato dish that came with it . I had the market fish and it was sole with over a bean, greens and sausage something or other that was to.die.for. 

Had a zucchini cake appetizer as well as the deviled eggs. Yes... deviled eggs! The eggs were familiar in a really good way and the zucchini cakes had us practically licking the plate. 

The service was excellent. The wine list is good without being stupid pretentious. I'm not a beer fan but the local beer our son had made him really happy. 

I'd give it five stars if it weren't brand new and if I had been there more than once with a similar experience."}
{"text":"We wish Earnest would come back.  We relocated here from the D.C. area and were pleasantly surprised to stumble on this gem in Chandler. The food, ambience and service could rival any big city bistro. Chandler needs another sophisticate but unpretentious neighborhood eatery."}
{"text":"We left right after they poured the water.  Service was flat, and non-energetic.  Saturday night before Christmas - no wonder we didn't have a hard time getting a short notice reservation."}
{"text":"Surprised! Read good reviews, but wasn't expecting such great food. I had the pork chop, it was cooked perfectly which is hard to do with the bone in. I want to leave 5 stars, but the service was wishy washy. My husband asked the \"bus boy\" or \"server assistant..\" (wasn't sure by the items they were assisting with), for an iced tea refill, the \"bus boy\" went up to our server and told her instead of just doing it, literally 10 minutes went by and our server finally brought it. Not a big deal, the restaurant was busy. My other complaint which I think is a big deal.. My 7 year old daughter was with us and they served her steak kabobs on a plastic plate with plastic silverware! Oxymoron. She hasn't used a plastic plate with little sectionals on it with plastic silverware for over 5 years. We spent a few nights over the holidays doing some 5 star dining and those places give her an actual steak knife and glass cup. I'm asking this restaurant to throw those ugly, plastic plates and plastic silverware away! My daughter is still laughing about it to this day. She said, \"Mom, I'm not a baby and I know how to cut a piece of steak, this is so ridiculous!\""}
{"text":"This is a great place. My wife and my default date night restaurant. Upscale, good service with full bar and above average wine selection. We always leave happy. The short ribs are always good but so is everything else. The banana desert is by far our favorite. To find this gem in Chandler is awesome."}
{"text":"Back for the third time.  Love the service, Alisha and Winston were great company tonight.  Great drinks, really good food and really like the atmosphere.  We are so glad that they made the switch....love that it is close to the house.  I see many visits in our future."}
{"text":"My rating went down after this visit. I thought we were in time for happy hour. The waitress gave us happy hour menus. She said to take our time. Happy hour ends at 6:30 she said. I ordered wine and dessert. The table next to me had a sandwich brought out and it looked delish so I ordered one. I was drooling over how good the ham looked. A few minutes later at 6:06 the waitress comes back and says that it's after happy hour so I can't get that price and asked if I still wanted it. I said yes. Then she came back and said that they don't even make them after happy hour. I was so disappointed. The guy next to me was loovviinngg his sandwich. Then moments later the woman on the other side of me then got the same damn sandwich brought out to her. COME ON!!!! You just told me they stopped making them!!!!  I'm super disappointed in you Earnest. I just wanted some ham."}
{"text":"First trip back since this location used to be 'cork.' Had a great experience with an attentive wait staff and host, friendly manager to check on us a couple of times, great food, and a nice selection of wine, cocktails, and brews. We started with the chorizo and pork belly over cornbread...we could've licked the bowl. The entrees were equally satisfying and the portion was generous. Short ribs were excellent! My wife had the duck that was on special and it was great as well. Great desserts if you can muster up the self control to save some room. 
I highly recommend earnest. It's a great addition to the east valley and the chandler area."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner with my wife and two great friends. The atmosphere is casual and the staff is both professional and friendly. 

I started with the root beer glazed pork belly. It was wonderfully tender with a slightly crisp edge. The sweet glaze perfectly melded with the meat and fat of the pork belly. The fried cheese curd were a nice accompaniment. 

My main course was the wild boar shoulder risotto. This was very nicely done. The boar was lean and tasty. The mushrooms and vegetables adding both texture and bright green flavors. 

The deviled eggs were a big hit with the other three in our party. 

The other main dishes were the pot roast, the fish of the day (fried sea bass), and the braised short rib. All were reported to be excellent. 

Definitely a keeper. We will return to try a number of other intriguing items on the menu."}
{"text":"This place was so good! Each dish brought out tickled my tastebuds 
The zucchini cakes covered in crab and champagne hollandaise was awesome! I ordered the short ribs and they were super flavorful and tender! I can't wait to go back and try more delectable dishes!

The atmosphere is comfortable very much like most wine bars but modern. 
Great place for fellow foodies to go!"}
{"text":"We had eaten at cork quite a few times so thought we'd give earnest a try. It was good but for the price, not great. Service was very good but a bit intrusive. But I'd rather be overly attended to than ignored. We had the zucchini cakes, which were good, but the crab on top didn't seem fresh. My husband liked his salad. He had the short ribs, which he said were fine but not outstanding. I had the barramundi fish special, which was just ok. It was over priced at $29, and the waiter did not give the price of when he described it. There was a lot of green purée and a few tablespoons of couscous. The pb&j creme brûlée was very good but the \"snickers bar\" was weirdly stand alone- it seemed like it should have some other components.
  So for 2 glasses of wine, 1 app, 1 salad, 2 entrees & 2 desserts it was $150 with the tip. Not a good value in my book. I will happily pay that amount if it's deserving but this was not. Also, they need to offer bread or something to start. Doubtful we will return, sadly."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time for my first anniversary with my man!  I am not the type to be comfortable at a place you need to pay $100 for a glass of beer, and I felt really good here!  The prices were very reasonable, and I'd argue there should only be two dollar signs rather than three on this place on Yelp. We wore our t-shirts and jeans and fit right in alongside some fancy shmancy dressed people.

The ambience was really nice.  It was a modern but also classy restaurant.  I LOVED their old school light bulbs and the succulents in the glass domes.  

I normally tip 20 percent, as I've been in the restaurant industry, and it is not easy!  However the waiter we had, has made me re-think this policy, in that he was so amazing!  Now, I'm judging future waiters based on how amazing this guy was.  he recommended a fantastic beer that is now my favorite beer.  He told us about all the dishes, personally asked the chef things we casually inquired about, served each of us on the correct side, and just made my fiancee and I feel really special, more so than anywhere I've eaten before.  I don't eat out at 5 star restaurants that often, but I don't eat just at Denny's either.  I certainly felt like I was eating at a 5 star restaurant!

I have also never had a more delicious scallop.  Ever!  It was meaty and cooked perfectly. Their savory monkey bread was also fantastic!  As a pescatarian, I do wish they had a few more fish and vegetable options that were not quite so heavy, but it all was so good!  The roasted cauliflower with greek yogurt sounds kind of gross and weird, but it works so well!  I can't recommend this place enough, especially for an SO or SO to be!  

My only real complaint is that they serve foire gras.  I wish they wouldn't, but I just don't order it and hope they stop that practice. Anyway, thanks Earnest!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best restaurant in Chandler.  Earnest can compete with some of the top restaurants in NYC.  Everything is made from scratch......  As Zagat would say Food 29, Service 28, Decor 27.  Enjoy!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner for the first time at Earnest last night.  The best thing about the place is the atmosphere.  I like the booths and the sound level is low enough that you easily talk which is becoming harder to find.  This was a good thing since it took two and half hours for dinner.  It took probably 10 minutes for the server to take our drink order, and at least another half hour before she came back and took our dinner order.   It didn't seem that busy, so I wonder where she was.  It then took at least 45 minutes to get our food. During that time it took at least 20 minutes to get a second glass of wine (pricey and small pours).  The only thing that was timely was the filling of our water glasses which was frequently done throughout the evening.  
  I had been there when it was Cork, and was expecting more casual food with lower prices.  However, the menu is very limited and I had a hard time finding something appealing. I ended up ordering the zucchini cakes and a side of the daily risotto.  While both were tasty, they were VERY SALTY--an ongoing problem at many restaurants!! Let your food speak for itself! My husband ordered the flat iron steak which was nicely done. His salad with the popcorn on it was very lacking and completely overpriced.  Add a side salad option at a reasonable price! 
I'd like to go back as there are so few options in that area, (BLD being the best), but they need to speed up service, add some more middle of the road food selections to the menu, reconsider food and wine prices,  and...hold the salt!"}
{"text":"Wish I could post \"0\" stars!!!!
We walked in at 6:00pm
Ordered dinner at 6:30
It's 8:15pm and we are still waiting for our food to arrive!
The restaurant is not busy but it seems the service is extremely poor!
Our waiter disappears for 10 to 15 minutes and we can't get a water refill. 

Not sure what is going on - but we are NEVER coming back here again!!!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Burgers are amazing, friendly staff and love the location. Highly recommend. My husband and I love Earnest hours. It's  a great way to sample items off the menu at happy hour prices."}
{"text":"Earnest formally Cork, which we've dined at several time and loved both food and service in the past. This was the first time trying Earnest: dinner at 7, for a party of 4, through Open Table, had requested a very quite table for my elderly father who is hard of hearing. Not much had changed in decor or feel of atmosphere. We were seating in the private room which was perfect!

A few things, our waiter Mike,  though very efficient seemed abrupt and a bit cold. Our drink order was taken right away and drinks and wine were delivered in a timely fashion. Our orders were taken and that's when the wait began. An hour went by and our appetizers finally came at 8:05. I had asked the server if there was a backup in orders and was told the kitchen was dealing with a party of 12 (not my problem).

Appetizers were Lamb Meatballs (peppercorn feta, roasted tomato, charred peppers, herbs), f.o.t.d (foie gras of the day), Warm Spinach Salad (soft boiled fried egg, corn nuts, shallots, apples, bacon vinaigrette). Dinner was the Perfect Hamburger (short ribs, swiss cheese, onion, horseradish aioli, pickle, fries), BBQ Pork Belly and Ribs (bacon and mushroom mac and cheese, cole slaw), and Cast Iron Flat Iron Steak (potato wedge, cream spinach, red wine sauce)

Overall food was very different from the Cork menu which I preferred more. The food was a bistro style, very rich, was unique combination which worked and was pleased to see the foie gras still on the menu. We were not impressed with the lamb meatballs (as raved about), a bit salty, the flat iron steak, though cooked perfectly was lacking taste and was just ok, my perfect Burger was good except for the stone cold pretzel bun that it was put on which I immediately discarded . The burger was done perfectly but was extremely rich with the short rib and onion topping. All other appetizers and entrees good (but not a wow factor)

All in all it was ok, we missed Cork (upscale dining which Chandler needs) service good but cold and kitchen slow, slow, slow. Would try another place unless I was having a foie gras attack."}
{"text":"I made a reservation based on good reviews here. It was a nice night so we sat outside. Our server DeAnna was great. She suggested a bottle of red wine and we agreed. That's when things got wonky. An hour later and still no wine or olive starter. I finally went to the hostess and asked what the deal was. DeAnna was great and was as upset as we were that things weren't going well. The wine we ordered was not available so DeAnna brought a different bottle that was excellent. We then ordered the zucchini cakes, the chili and Brussels sprouts, all of which were delicious. Not sure what is going on there but I hope they fix it."}
{"text":"I'm currently seated at my table of 6. It's a Friday night, we had a reservation for 7:30pm, it is 9:18 as I type this, and our mains have NOT arrived.

I understand it's Friday night, but waiting this long for entrees is unacceptable. Waitstaff is perfectly sweet, but no apology or mention of a busy kitchen has been mentioned by the staff.

I rarely visit my folks in Chandler, but we wont be back. Quality of food doesn't matter if back of house is this slow on a prime night. We were going to go out after this dinner but that's probably not happening at this rate.

UPDATE: the entrees were actually really good once we got them (at around 9:30). For this reason I am moving to 2 stars versus my original 1 star. Also, the front of house staff was very courteous."}
{"text":"I loved this place when it was Cork.  We went there this week for dinner, and the food & service was sub-par at best.  Our waiter (jack ass) was not familiar with menu,  and could not give my wife or her friend any feedback on the wine list.  The dessert was inedible, and was sent back.  This place was much better when Robert was in charge.  It's clear they are having issues figuring out both the front & back of the house.  There is one thing that I'll guarantee - I will not go back to this place, and that is very disappointing!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came to cork often. We like Earnest just as well!  The food was still just as yummy, and the staff is still wonderful! The new decor is classy yet casual, and the restaurant has a very open warm feel to it. 

My only suggestions would be to change the music (it was a loud rock type), and even if you dont want to carry bud light or coors light on tap, having a staple beer like that in the bottle is always a good idea. Not everyone is a fan of hoppy brews (even though they are all the rage right now)

We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Wow, train wreck of a business dinner for 10 colleagues tonight. Sat at the table for 2 hours with no dinner (wait, 1 out of 10 entrees did show up....say what?) Manager should have been at the table after 30 minutes. He/she wasn't there then OR after we asked for him/her. Inexcusable."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a bite and drink for the start of our night out. No reservations on a busy Saturday night but they were accommodating nonetheless. Crab cake was amazing and the Cobb salad was delish! Husband ordered the pan seared chicken which I tried a few bites before he cleaned his plate. Very happy with our experience and plan to return!"}
{"text":"I've had dessert at this place and a meal and it was delicious. The fried chicken is really good and I also enjoyed the apple cobbler à la mode with a latte martini."}
{"text":"Four star restaurant in terms of food, service and....price. High class interior, fantastic food, perfect service. We were a party of four; had appetizers, drinks, entrees and dessert. $60 bucks each with tip or $ 120 per couple. Nice splurge."}
{"text":"The service was great. From the moment we walked in the manager greeted us and took us straight to our table. The atmosphere was welcoming and relaxing. Our waiter was knowledgeable and friendly. They had a full coffee service with espresso and cappuccino which was perfect after a long day.
We tried the fried soft boiled egg as an appetizer that was recommended by the server. It was something out of the ordinary. It turned out to be great and a nice twist compared to the deviled eggs.
  As far as the food, the risotto was the perfect texture and full of flavor. The salmon came out a little under done to my liking, but it was my fault for not asking. For others it may have been perfect. It was expressed, taken care of delightfully, and much appreciated. The glaze on the salmon was amazing and went well the rest of the rice and vegetables it sat on. 
I would highly recommend dessert. The cinnamon bread pudding is well worth the extra wait. We will definitively be returning."}
{"text":"We ordered Thanksgiving dinner from here. First, our family has never ordered a holiday meal from a restaurant and we were all very unsure what to expect. 

Well, let me tell you, EVERYTHING was exceptional! The turkey was moist and the stuffing was excellent, smashed potatoes and gravy were divine and OMG the fried Brussels sprouts were out of this world! I'm not a big fan of cranberry sauce, but theirs was the perfect mix of tangy and sweet without being too much of either. And for dessert, the pumpkin pie was wonderfully done, it was subtle and not overly \"pumpkiny.\"  All in all, we (five of us) were all completely happy with our choice this year for Thanksgiving dinner!

The only thing I would mention, as a suggestion to Earnest for the future, is to not package every meal individually- we had five separate plastic containers for potatoes, for butter, for cranberry sauce, for gravy, for whipped cream and for turkey, stuffing and veggies. This means we had a lot of trash and it seemed very wasteful. Since, I'm guessing, most orders were taken to eat at home, individually packaged portions weren't necessary."}
{"text":"Saturday night was my first experience at Earnest and will probably be my last. The restaurant had plenty of pros and cons and they are as follows:

Pros: 
- The place is aesthetically pleasing; very nice boutique vibe to the restaurant.
- Friendly hostess and server (at first).
- Wonderful Restaurant Manager, Scott; he went above and beyond by around filling waters and made sure that our party was well looked after while we waited. So hats off to him!
- The Mac and Cheese ( bacon and mushroom ) was quite tasty.  

Cons:
- The service slowed down exponentially once we ordered even though the restaurant was pretty dead while we were there. There were maybe three-four other tables and a couple towards the end at the high top area. So for a boutique restaurant at dinner time (6:30pm-9pm) it was quite slow.
- The Mac and Cheese ( bbq ) was extremely bland and had to be sent back.
- When the bill came and split checks were requested by our party, our server became overwhelmed and slightly passive aggressive while asking how we wanted the checks. Not okay or professional, in my opinion.

All in all, my food was good, the restaurant was beautiful and the service ( with the exception of Scott ) was just okay."}
{"text":"Earnest is a little drop of Sunshine in south Chandler. If Earnest isn't the best restaurant in Chandler, I'd love to hear from you. In my opninion Earnest can compete with some of the top restaurants in any major city.  I feel really lucky to have spot like this so close to home.

For picky eaters (or us vegetarians), everything is made from scratch, so if you want to make a modification, the answer is yes. Who doesn't love hearing yes!

- The zucchini cakes and champagne hollandaise are amazing!
- The wait staff is absurdly attentive and incredible. 
- The fried brussels sprouts, lets just say tremendous. 
 
Not to mention any of the melt in your mouth delicious desserts. Seriously try them ALL.

Bottom line. Great food, amazing atmosphere, and located in south Chandler! I love Earnest."}
{"text":"Terrible.

Everything from the service on New Years eve to the food choices.

This place was good when it was Cork and had a great happy hour. As for its New Years dining experience which they charged $75 per person for it was horrible.

Horrible server. The worst Cake ever, everyone at the table sent it back. It was overcooked and dry and tasted like something purchased at a 3day old mexican bakery.

The fish was the only thing anyone liked to be honest. The short rib dish was horrible and definitely NOT worth the $75 per person price of admission.

Not once did the waiter apologize for anything at all, not even a single dish that was sent back. He looked extremely coked out actually."}
{"text":"We went for a drink during HH before our dinner reservation. When we arrived there was a little miscommunication with the host on this, it was a little annoying. Sitting at the bar, I ordered the house white and my guy ordered the house red. The bartender gave us both reds. I didn't say anything, I let it go. The wine was good so I didn't mind too much. He was chatty but VERY chatty I couldn't tell if he was having a nice conversation with all of the patrons or if it was condescending. Both of us thought this. Our friends arrived and then were seated. We wanted to try this place during restaurant week. My guy and I actually ordered the same meal, deviled eggs, steak with chimichurri and the bread pudding. My friends ordered the salad, cod and steak, ice cream cookies and bread pudding. The deviled eggs were the biggest disappointment. I am such a huge fan of them but they were so mediocre. I should have chosen something else. The steak was rare just as I ordered it, it was good but I have had better. The bread pudding was very tasty and came in a cute mini cast iron pot. The server was present but he wasn't fantastic. Bottom line - no one at the table was wowed by the service or food. The only thing that stands out is the very cute decor and we loved the table in the middle that slides in ad out for larger parties. We decided that we won't be revisiting this restaurant for dinner, maybe for only HH."}
{"text":"I wrote this review over on the Cork page, so I figured I would drop it here as well.  

I brought a date here on a Thursday evening, the restaurant had a good amount of patrons and was not crowded.  The hostess sat us and the waiter came over to get us started, the wine and beer list is on an iPad which I thought was cool and easy to navigate.  We order drinks and my date and I were having great conversation the waiter felt bad for interrupting us but I was appreciative he was cordial about checking in.   

We finally ordered another drink and food.  Our salad came out and we chatted over that for what seemed 5 minutes but was actually 30.  The waiter came over and said that he hadnt put the order in quite yet because he noticed we were enjoying one anothers company and asked if we would like to delay the meal or go ahead and get it started.  I thought this was really nice of the waiter and very thoughtful.  

Now to the food, the Mac and cheese was amazing...  I normally dont say Mac and Cheese is amazing but this was so full of flavor, bits of bacon, mushrooms, it had a smokey taste that left an amazing after flavor in your mouth.  

I highly suggest the PB&J creme brulee for desert as well...    

I will return!"}
{"text":"About month ago we decided to give this place a try. The atmosphere was nice. It took a while for the waitress to finally come by. No one ever took our drink orders. As the pricing suggest, it was $$$. That was OK with us as we knew that going in. We ordered hamburgers which arrived 30 minutes later. Mine was WELL DONE, as in dried and shoe leather tasting. I ordered medium. My partner order medium well and his was rare.  We couldn't find out waitress so we notified some one else. No one came over until they brought the check. We told them how unhappy we were. Their answer? You should have told us before you ate it!  We explained we did. Then the manager came over. We explained the problems. And told him we eat out a lot but usually go to Eddies Place for a great burger. We were looking for a place a little closer to home. His reply?  \"Well, we are not Eddie's Place!\"  A little more back and forth comments and he walked away. No comment that he was sorry they did not prepare our food correctly and no adjustment. I literally couldn't eat the burger so it was still sitting there for him to see how extremely overlooked it was. BAD MANAGER ATTITUDE. We will never return!"}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this restaurant lately (specifically the happy hour) so I decided to give it a try. I was very pleasantly surprised. I had the happy hour burger and onion rings and they couldn't have been better. The burger was juicy, the onion rings were crispy but not over cooked, and the thick cut bacon - holy goodness batman! I also loved the happy hour basil gimlet; so much so, I had two. Moreover, the blonde bartender (I can't remember her name) was wonderful... Fun but professional. I will be recommending this restaurant."}
{"text":"Atmosphere = great

Service =Scott was good to great, helper clueless when asked questions about the restaurant. Not that this should matter but it was odd when he was talked to he acted as though he was being bothered. Would think the staff would be more versed. 

Food = very tasty yet not hot enough actually more like lukewarm 

Happy hour pricing: reasonable to moderate 

Return = Maybe"}
{"text":"My family and I celebrated my sisters birthday last night and we were totally blown away.  We started off with Zucchini Cakes, Crab Cakes, Olives, Sausage & Chorizo.  For the main course we order the Alaskan Cod, Skirt Steak, Vegetarian Pasta & Pork Chops.   We also ordered 2 sides to share: Risotto & Mac & Cheese.  All I can say is WOW!!  Food was beyond our expectation and service was excellent.  We will return for sure!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here the Friday before last. We were sat quickly, it was a little slow and calm, which was lovely. The food was amazing, from the appetizer to the main dish. The wine list was superb as well. The not so great factor was the service, while our waiter was nice he was incredibly slow and it took an hour to get our food after ordering. I don't mind waiting for amazing food but when your establishment is slow, it should not take an hour for your food to come out, especially when you order vegetarian. Besides the slow service and our waiter being never available the food/ atmosphere was top notch."}
{"text":"We love Earnest! We feel like we have a 4-star restaurant within just a few miles of our home. We get nothing but excellent service and food here. My husband's boss wanted to take us to dinner and we got the pick of any Phoenix restaurant and we chose Earnest. They have a great atmosphere too. If you go, you must get the soft boiled eggs. Amazing! I hated having to share them! Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have much respect for the partners and tenured staff and was pleased to hear about the new format and casual atmosphere. As always, greeted at the door like an old friend and quickly seated in the new open concept dining room. Everything about the place looks and feels more comfortable, a transformation that only took 2 weeks (Bravo!). Started the night with a nice bottle of Ridge Three Valley's red blend, smartly priced ($50) and very tasty. The wine list and entire drink menu is offered on an iPad, not enough time to browse, but I'm confident the choices will remain robust. Enjoyed our 2 app choices, chickpeas and the cheese board. Entrees were right on target (nothing less expected from Chef Brian), including BBQ ribs w/ pork belly and hanger steak. Danielle has fabulous new dessert options including cookies and adult chocolate milk, along with PB&J Creme Brûlée. 

Congrats for making the transition from small plate formal (Cork) to the new comfort casual of Earnest. Looking forward to many more visits with friends and family. (FYI - the 4 star rating is more about what's to come, as it would be too easy to slap a 5 star rating right out of the gate :)."}
{"text":"I've been here when the restaurant was Cork and now this is my first visit to Earnest. The dining room is much more open, lively, and the music and crowd noise is certainly louder. Not the quiet romantic spot that it used to be, but still a great restaurant. The menu is somewhat less pricey and a bit more limited but the food is still out of this world delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing food!  The brussel sprouts are super delicious and I would eat them every day!  The truffle fries are also awesome! The hamburger we had was one of the best burgers we've ever had.  I wasn't a big fan of the grilled cheese but there wasn't really anything wrong with it, it just wasn't to my taste...a little too much pork belly in my opinion (blasphemy I know!) but it looked really good, my friend ate most of his half and liked it!"}
{"text":"I came here with my sister for dinner last weekend. It was my first time dining here since the renovation. This used to be my go-to spot for a special occasion dinner back when it was Cork. I heard that they were trying to make Earnest a more casual concept but everything seemed pretty much the same to me except a few minor cosmetic changes in the décor. The prices on the menu were just as high. We spent $100 for the two of us including tax and tip as well as a $30 bottle of wine that tasted a bit off.

Anyway, it ended up being worth it because we both loved our food. We started with the fried Brussels sprouts which were amazing. We both loved them so much and I really wish the dish came with more. My sister ordered the vegetable lasagna and she raved over it even though it had ricotta cheese which she doesn't usually like too much. I got the lamb meatballs and daily risotto. These are on the menu as a starter and a side dish, respectively, but together they made for a very delicious meal. The lamb meatballs are a must-order, they are truly fantastic. I was impressed with the risotto as well. It was perfectly cooked, not too mushy but still wonderfully creamy and smooth.

I will definitely be returning to Earnest since the food was so good. But unfortunately I probably will still reserve it for special occasions due to the price point."}
