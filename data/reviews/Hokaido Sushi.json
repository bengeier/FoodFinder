{"text":"Me and my lady used to come to this spot at least once a month for the amazing sushi. This all changed as of last night as we are currently looking for a new spot. Owner and sushi chef were a little hmmmm let's just say messed up from a tiny bit to much drinking, along comes customer to my left ( we sat in the middle of two different groups at the sushi bar ) drinking and having shots with the head chef, some conversation about where they are from is exchanged and then escalates to the head chef cussing him out taking his shirt off to show his tattoos, which ended up in customer to my right coming out of no where and playing referee for customer and Mr Head Chef who has been in jail and is from LA. Now I'm from LA myself and don't need to hear your story about what part your from or what gang you rolled with when you were younger, years in jail etc.  I don't normally go out of my way to write many reviews and I loved this place for years but if you are thinking about going here I would say try somewhere else !"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best sushi restaurants in Las Vegas.  The staff is super friendly and the sushi is some of the best in town.  Great variety, fresh fish and the presentation is beautiful!  Prices are great as well.  You have to try it!"}
{"text":"No AYCE option. :( BUT the fish is extremely fresh. The freshest I've seen around town. The prices are a bit higher than other sushi places but that's ok with me if the quality is great. The staff is really nice and friendly. Definitely try this place out if you're looking for really fresh sashimi and sushi!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is a must!!!!  I'm a die hard Japanese foos fan and I when I went there during happy hour I couldn't believe when I saw the menu.  Lots of options! Yummy! Shame there isn't any sashimi in it!"}
{"text":"Hokaido Sushi is life changing. Chicken soup for the sushi lover's soul. Candy for people who love it in its purest, authentic form. A trip to the shores of Japan, New Zealand, Washington state, and Korea for people who can't splurge for the plane ticket or haven't renewed their passports. This place has a loyal following at the sushi bar which must be chalked up to their sushi chefs, especially head chef Sam. He is bar none the best.  Our group of four sat at the bar and ordered omakase. My husband is a diehard sushi purist and can't stop raving about the quality and taste of the fish. The entire omakase was the bomb - there's simply no better way to describe it - but if we had to pick standouts they would include the toro (fatty tuna), salmon belly, wild king salmon from New Zealand, uni from the Channel Islands, Shigoku oysters from Washington, and hamachi with thin silver of jalape√±o and cilantro. Basically find a place at the bar with Sam and he will treat you right. He may even recommend fresh fish off menu if it's available. The omakase is very reasonable - $28 pp for 10 pieces.   My only regret is that we don't live in Vegas and therefore can't come once a week. If my husband ever went missing, Hokaido is the first place I'd check.   Thank you Sam for a masterful meal.  Save a seat for us at the bar- we'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"The value and taste of hakkaido cannot be beat. The happy hour is very cheap yet the sushi is still some of the best in Vegas. I highly recommend Hokkaido"}
{"text":"My sister n law got me hooked to Hokaido Sushi  Super yummy! Literally come in once a week for their HAPPY HOUR ! Definelty a nice place to have a relaxing meal.  You have to try the Darkhorse roll and spicy crab roll is always a favorite."}
{"text":"I've frequented this restaurant for a few years. Good food and friendly service. For great locals sushi on the west side you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Nice little cozy place with friendly staff. Wide sushi selection."}
{"text":"Please, please, please get a second server! Service is too slow with the single server all day.  Food is fantastic for all ages!"}
{"text":"Great spot for affordable sushi, but beyond that the staff is really friendly and accommodating.  The sushi rolls are fresh and there are so many great combinations to choose from. In just the few visits I've had I have found three rolls that are my new all time favorite. Plus the garlic edamame for an appetizer is so delicious. Did I mention friendly? Whether you're at the sushi bar or sitting at a table in the dining area all staff is very attentive and makes you feel invited and comfortable."}
{"text":"I had to join Yelp to give them a review. Because the new owner does not welcome local guests who do not want his special dishes that he said its special, but I didn't see anything special about it, but the price.  We didn't think bill came up over $300 for 3of us. We did not eat that much, and I did not see anything special.  I get it was slow night, but they did not supose to up selling their dishes without telling us how much it is.  We were surprised when we got our check.  Too much.  Ownership must have changed, it was not like this before.  Not recommended, we can find better, and cheaper sushi bar, I  am never going back to this place ever."}
{"text":"I took a friend with me on the 14th of September and found few customers in the Restaurant. Only my second visit, my first was on a different day and was crowded. I ordered my favorite Hamachi and was disappointed with the flavor. It had a strange aftertaste I could not pinpoint but, the second order was more the normal. Both were not the usual and delicate sweetness. The stringed seaweed was outstanding, the  Mizo soup delicious and the dishes the waitress recommended to my friend were greatly enjoyed by him. With the present state of the Oceans and products taken from them; quality worldwide is not what it used to be. I refer to my experience dating between 2000 all the way back to 1969. Our waitress was extremely helpful, the environment clean and I will be back for another round of Hamachi and more very soon. Looking forward to a better cut and flavor next trip."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's good every time I come here. Rocky and Su are awesome sit with them at the bar !!"}
{"text":"The fish is not appetizing and everything was soggy. I am extremely disappointed because I didn't expect for a basic spicy tuna roll could taste so bad. I feel like the fish wasn't fresh and could be so much better if it was. we ordered the tiger roll, paradise, Hawaiian and dark horse. It all tasted the same and drenched in the sweet sauce. It was like they were trying to hide the fact that the tuna and salmon wasn't fresh."}
{"text":"Great sushi fantastic service chefs are so talented and friendly only place I go for sushi"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the Udon!!!! Chicken Katsu is their best. For Bento plate best deal is at lunch time."}
{"text":"Sushi is great! This place is awesome for groups and the food overall is really good. Also try the udon soup!!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much! Will go in for lunch as many times as I can afford it. It's not an ayce place, so normally get garlic tuna nigiri, churchy philly roll and alternate the other. One time I got the volcano roll and it came out in a beautiful presentation complete with flames!!  I was so impressed with their plating   Super clean tables and restaurant, attentive servers, quick drink refills, and quick service especially when your on your lunch break   Everything I have ever gotten from here was amazing.  Eta: I took advantage of their happy hour specials today (after 2pm) and the prices were great!!  Will be going back for that :)"}
{"text":"I love this place...they have some of the best sushi. Order the Double D...it comes with a screaming orgasm sauce that puts an extra kick to your tastebuds."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the best sushi I have ever had.  The chefs are outstanding and have the freshest fish and most awesome service possible.  Everything I have had from the menu has been great, but where Hokaido really shines is their specials. I generally order from the specials and have had more amazing fish since going there than I have had my entire life.  I drive up from Phoenix just to go here."}
{"text":"I LOVE the salmon teriyaki bento but they give such a tiny piece that it makes me so upset. I had given them a chance atleast 5 times... instead I just order their shrimp and vegetable tempura bento, it is delicious. I would give them 3.5 Stars but yelp has no 1/2 stars...because when i complained about the salmon, the lady cook came out and started yelling at me!! Rude!"}
{"text":"It took 30 mins for 2 pieces of uni. The hell.. never again. And the place wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"This place is possibly the best sushi I've had in Vegas since moving here over 2 years ago.  First off, this place is not AYCE, and I don't care, they're worth every penny.  The quality of the fish I had tonight was superb, and the selection was impressive.  I didn't order any rolls, but the people at the sushi bar next to me did and they looked wonderful.  Another important thing to note is the knife skills here, each slice of fish they cut was almost identical, and they didn't over-rice the nigiri or hand rolls.  Overall, this place gets top marks in my books, and some of the sushi chefs around town could definitely come here for lessons."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. Great happy hour. Angela, Jennifer and Rocky are amazing. It's very hospitable here. Best garlic edamame I've ever had."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've ever had.  The presentation of the sushi is incredible and prices are very reasonable. Chefs Eric and JJ made it very fun too. Great Place!"}
{"text":"Sushi in LV for me has been just ok so far. I've been here 3 months, not long, I know, but I have tried several places and they seem exactly alike and simply nothing that special. I've been to Hokaido 3 times, and it's been consistently good. They have a great menu, good portions of fresh fish (nothing worse than paper thin fish on a nigiri), and it's a comfortable place.  For me, the Dark Horse roll gets Hokaido that extra star - shrimp tempura, crab, and avocado roll topped with toasted coconut and some sort of yummy sauce. This roll makes it worth the trip every time."}
{"text":"Awesome. I'll come back pretty soon for eating fantastic sushi and rolls. I've never been great sushi place like here!"}
{"text":"I don't understand. I thought this place was good. The service was really slacking and our food took forever to come out. Chirashi bowl doesn't even use sushi rice. It is just plain rice with furikake on it. So it tastes horrible. And the price did not justify the quality of the fish!! Don't think I'll be coming back here for awhile..."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best sushi in las vegas! I've gone here a dozen times and they never let me down. Presentation, taste, atmosphere, and staff is all on point. My fav is the q roll, but so many more rolls are phenomenal. I've been to a lot of sushi restaurants and although I try to find other restaurants that compare and nothing ever comes close! Hokaido!! You rock :)"}
{"text":"I've been to Hokaido few times for lunch and dinner. They always have fresh and special fishes. The dish was excellently prepared. It was juicy and there was no hint of any fishiness. I love their oysters too! I definitely recommend this place! :)"}
{"text":"The service is great and the food is always amazing! Good assortment for happy hour and the sauce on their cucumber salad is just out of this world!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Quiet environment and friendly staff. Chef created awesome rolls according to what we liked. \"I like your ass\" roll is a must. The garlic tuna is perfect. Def recommend!"}
{"text":"Food is decent. Fish was fresh. Service was fine. There wasn't a lot of people for lunch. We didn't do AYCE, as we weren't that hungry. Would probably eat here again if we were nearby."}
{"text":"Everyone is super nice super sweet!!   They food is to die for!!! Everything in the menu is amazing"}
{"text":"Very good sushi at a fair price.   Eating sushi in the desert is fairly daring proposition as I've found most sushi joints around Vegas being subpar.   Hokaido is our spot. The fish is fresh and JJ is the  best I've seen in Vegas. Only Philly and California have beaten this place for sushi from what I've found.   I definitely prefer this to all other SW sushi spots."}
{"text":"I loved the food here!  The sushi was very fresh. We had the 300, happy ending and another one with veggies that was just wonderful.  Also...had the peanut butter mochi for dessert.  Never had PB mochi before and it was really really good! I will definitely be back to this place! My only complaint was that the service was a little on the slow side, but other than that it was great!"}
{"text":"because of good reviews, I went to this place with my friend. not too crowded on a Friday night. We thought we would try it, what a bad decision.ordered iced tea, got a sprite, took them a long time to bring our food, for that tiny little pieces, bit pricy. no all u can eat.      spent $70 for two people before tip, left hungry. was afriad to order more, didn't want to wait another 30 mins. so disappointed. went to Mc Donalds to satisfy hungry belly. never go back again."}
{"text":"I live 3 minutes from here and have eaten sushi all over city. This place and Bocho downtown are amazing!!!  Fresh great fish and they have brown rice for all you healthy eaters.  Hands down one of best in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is the best Sushi spot I've visited in Vegas, it's ALWAYS fresh. I usually call in, and order to go for lunch, or when I have family or friends visiting.  The prices are not to bad, they have an excellent happy hour menu."}
{"text":"I use to come here almost every week. That was 4 years ago & it was mine and my moms favorite place!   I stopped goin for about 2 years. And my boyfriend and i recently started going again.. We went for happy hour~ half price on most rolls. But guess what? Its also HALF of a roll not a whole roll. I have NEVER seen any sushi restaurant do that before. The service was also terrible. We thought okay whatever its close & sushi is decent. So we went back a few weeks later. Still terrible, nothing has changed... I was so sad because i really wanted to love it like i use to.   Tonight we decided to get it one more time because we didnt want to drive all the way to our usual sushi spot... I got chicken teriyake, what can go wrong with chicken teriyake right? WRONG! There were glumps of the sauce on top of my chicken. Really wth glumps??? So i jus pushed it to the side.. But the chicken was cold too! I think its safe to say, we're officially done with this place."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. The food and sushi has always been fresh and well prepared.  Angela is the kindness and best waitress we know there. She's very friendly her service is top notch."}
{"text":"Best sushi in vegas hands down! Super friendly staff, they know me by my name and welcome me with open arms everytime I walk through the door.  I eat there at least once a week.  They do not have all you can eat, but the quality of the rolls is unbeatable.  \"The sweetheart\" roll is pure heaven.  JJ, Eric Tony are the chefs and are authentically Korean/Japaneese.  Not some mexican in a komono pretending to know how to prepare rolls.  Very clean, no scent to the restruant.  A++++"}
{"text":"After today I realized, I've been eating mediocre sushi my whole life. This place is awesome!! The young guy making the sushi was friendly, informative, and a sushi pro. The toro tuna mouth watering and basically melted in my mouth. The halibut from Jeju and the spicy poke salad unforgettable. Loved the Korean beer and soju option also. I will definitely be going back. It's the best sushi I've ever had.   *Ask for some fresh wasabi. So good!!"}
{"text":"I'll just say it: there are better sushi restaurants in town. HOWEVER: (1) this place is closest to my house; and (2) they serve brown rice.  So, automatic four stars (yes, I am lazy and needlessly obsessed with blood glycemic levels.)  Moving on from the disclaimer...  Brown rice chirashi exists in this establishment.  Boom, I'm there.  Also, they make a really great non-rice roll called Muchi Muchi.  It involves a sexy union of shrimp tempura and lettuce.  Boom, I'm there.  Sometimes, however, the rice is a little hard, like it's been sitting around for 72 hours. At that point, a single tear rolls down my cheek......"}
{"text":"After eating here for many years I decided to finally post a review. Its fantastic quality of fish/Sushi never had a bad meal here. Can't say a negative thing staff is also freidley and professional."}
{"text":"Okay, I gave Hokaido a try this weekend because most of the reviews were favorable. However, I have to say this is the worst sushi I have had in a long time. We ordered the Crazy Horse, spicy tuna, california rolls, and yellowtail sashimi. The raw fish was just awful. The yellowtail and spicy tuna were fishy smelling & the texture was mushy. As for the Crazy Horse, it was fried, so it was hard to really tell what was going on. The california rolls were fine & the habachi rice was good. If you're going for sushi, I would just say that the fish just isn't fresh at all. The worst part about the meal was the very end when I went to the restroom & found it to be dirty and there was no soap in the dispenser. Gross! We were there at 12:30 in the afternoon and the restaurant was close to empty, so the bathroom obviously hadn't been cleaned since the night before. Needless to say, I will not be back."}
{"text":"We'd been looking for a good sushi bar for a long time--real sushi (not just rolls), fresh and tasty sashimi, served by a chef that knows what he's doing and interacts with the customers.  You get all of that at Hokaido.  JJ and Eric provide fantastic service and are a ton of fun to eat with.  The presentation of every dish is top notch and the prices are good.  This has become our regular spot."}
{"text":"Let me say I don't eat sushi. I am writing this for/as my husband. He is a HUGE fan so the first time he went to this place he was excited. He went about 30 minutes before closing time ( which could suck but still) and they refused to service him. About two months later he tried this place again, at an earlier time, during happy hour. Of course they wouldn't let him do happy hour if it was to go. Not only would they not let him do this but they were very very rude. If you run a business and you're food is awesome... That doesn't mean crap if your service is the worst. Don't go here. They are rude and disrespectful. Service sucks here!"}
{"text":"Just moved to this part of town so I drove around till I found a place to eat. I saw the sushi sign and decided to give it a try.           I ordered a few dishes, some unagi, a. Hawaiian roll, crunchy ebi roll, and hibachi rice. All of it in my opinion was pretty mediocre.  Not bad, not great, just average.       Having said that the venue is very clean, the waitresses were nice and very attentive. With lots of options to choose from on the menu.        The one thing that really bummed me out is there is no all you can eat sushi option, maybe I'm just a fatty, but I like to try a lot of different rolls. When they are $10 and up its tough to do that and the bill gets really expensive.        Anyways, if you haven't tried it yet I would say give it a go and see for youself, if you're an all you can eat kinda guy like me then save yourself a trip and skip out."}
{"text":"We ate dinner last night here and the food was delicious as always. The soft shell crab is always to die for. Waitress was super friendly."}
{"text":"Very high quality food.  Thr bikini rolls are awesome. The place is kinda pricy but when you try them you'll know why."}
{"text":"I had a mad craving for sushi last night. We thought we'd give a place close to home a try. Hokaido fit the bill. The parking lot was empty which made us a little concerned. We went inside and the dining room was empty, too. Uh-oh. What were we in for?  Variety of offerings is wide. It took us a bit to choose. Finally we settled on chicken udon noodle, and three rolls: Dark Horse, Japanese Lasagna and a classic spicy tuna. We were brought a tasty cucumber salad to get us started. Then, the noodles arrived and the rolls followed.  The noodles were really good, but near impossible to eat with chopsticks. We broke down and asked for a fork.... much easier to enjoy. The lasagna was our least favorite roll, it fell apart easily since it was baked. It was hard to get that perfect bite. Plus, I'm generally not a fan of cream cheese, but it sounded intriguing so I gave it a whirl. Lesson learned--I'm still not much of a fan. The classic spicy tuna was the favorite. Although, the Dark Horse was enjoyable. I especially liked the crunchy texture.  All in all, it was a shame the restaurant was so dead."}
{"text":"We first tried this place in July 2011, because we were looking to go to sushi near our residence.  We went later at night, with not a very busy crowd so we were a little skeptical when we sat down at our table.  They far exceeded our expectations!  We go back very frequently for my absolute favorite sushi ever, the Philly Crunch Roll (a tempura fried philly roll with an amazing sauce).  The presentation is always awesome, except for one time.  The sushi chefs were busy entertaining some guests sitting at the bar, so we didn't get any special plating which was a little disappointing.  They have a wide variety of rolls, and they are usually really friendly.  Everything tastes really fresh (once we did get a spicy yellowtail that tasted a little less than fresh, but one time only).  We usually go around 9-10 pm at night, and its usually not very busy which always surprises me, but maybe its the location.   I would recommend everyone try this place!"}
{"text":"I have now been to Hokaido Sushi twice and every time I seem to go it gets better and better. The first time I went it was just my boyfriend and I. I two amazing rolls but can't remember the name and my bf doesn't eat sushi so he had steak and rice, he loved it. Then I went this past Friday with my bf and two friends came into town and they are die hard sushi eaters like me and they loved it. The prices are amazing and the food is totally worth it. I like to sit at the bar and watch them make the food it is fun and they can help you chose something if you don't know what you are really looking for. Best place in Las Vegas so far!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The sushi is superb! My girlfriend and I meet here at least twice a month for our sushi fix. Our favorite rolls are Dark Horse and What the Hell. Also, the cucumber salad is to die for! I wish I'd had the recipe. The staff is always nice and very polite. Slight downfall, is the waiting time, even when it's not too busy and an hour lunch break is barely enough to eat great sushi and chat for a bit, if you can get passed the wait (which is well worth it) you'll love this place!"}
{"text":"Trying this place for the first time and it was good! However, the salmon sashimi and buttery nipple was okay. My hubby and I enjoyed the Hawaiian roll and the dynamite."}
{"text":"I haven't found a sushi bar out here in Vegas that I have enjoyed since i moved out here this past May, but when I went to Hokaido, found it off Yelp, I was very satisfied. I'm from Chicago, and out there I know of a handful of good sushi places out there. I'm sure there are good places out here in Vegas, and in time i'm sure i'll find good places, but this place was awesome! I was out with my sweetheart and we started out with the beef asparagus rolls...yummy! The cucumber salad was next with the green salad, very good as well. They dressing they used on both, same dressing, was very good. I tried miso soup there and that was standard, and good too. For rolls we got the \"chicken teriyaki roll,\" \"what the hell,\" and the \"butter nipple!\" They all were fantastic. The staff was very friendly and courteous! Very nice people, very nice place. I definitely will be back, and for now, this place is my favorite sushi place!"}
{"text":"Delicious lunch!  I started with the kanpachi  usuzukuri, which was phenomenal.  The sushi chef was quite friendly and gave me a very generous sample of their bluefin tuna, then the toro - yum!  I finished with some nigiri and will definitely go back.  Everything tasted fresh, looked beautiful and the service was very friendly."}
{"text":"I love Hokaido, I have been coming here for 4.5 years! I love the sushi chefs here! Su, Rocky, Ken are wonderful with customer service and friendly. They treat all of my friends like family. I've been invited to there Xmas party when my family was away. I will continue coming here and recommending people to come also. I've recently began eating vegan and they cater to my needs. The shiitake mushroom vegan roll is so delicious!  It's a must to come here!!! They make some amazing custom rolls!"}
{"text":"This is a first... I've never been to a sushi joint that showed so much dedication on presentation before! I'm blown away with Hokaido's creativity.   Came here with my cousin for dinner and sat at the sushi bar. We love being up close and personal with the sushi chef ;) haha. Anway, while we both scanned the menu, my cousin noticed the chef prepping something that caught her attention which was the \"Marilyn Monroe\" roll - tuna, green onion, cucumber, soypaper, spicy scallop. As for me, I ordered the \"Dynamite\" and \"Bikini\" roll. The Dynamite - shrimp, scallops, clam & mushroom over rice, baked in a shell. The Bikini roll - spicy soft shell crab, cucumber, shrimp tempura, seared tuna, and avocado.   First reaction as he served us our orders... WOAH. Our food had flowers and carved butterflies out of carrots and radishes!!! Let me repeat.. CARVED BUTTERFLIES! That's talent! xD haha. It made me not want to eat it because it was so pretty. And, the sushi's were absolutely delicious! I mean damn... that was some good shit. Quality of the fish was fresh. Not chewy. Which is super important.  Check list: Customer service - check. Food quality - check. Presentation - check.   Will I return?! OHHHH YEAAAAHH.   *Note to self - Hokaido does not offer AYCE."}
{"text":"Sushi is fresh and comes from premium cuts of fish, rolls are consistent and well balanced. The happy hour is phenomenal and you don't have to crush your stomach by forcing yourself to get your $'s worth at some AYCE joint. Highly recommended. Shoutout to Peter, Su, and Ken the efficient and funny chefs."}
{"text":"Have been there twice and both times very good. Happened to walk in during happy hour and that makes Me happy. Was able to try many new items and not break the bank. Very fresh and flavorful, you won't be disappointed. Highly recommend. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"First time eating at this place. They offer Happy hour-BONUS. The place look empty. The waitress was nice. The food is really fresh. I had yellow tail sushi and that probably the freshest yellow tail i have had at a good price.  Will come back next time after work before I pick up my kids ( i deserve some quiet time)"}
{"text":"Forget the menu, just tell the new sushi chef Sam what you like and be prepared to fall in love. He is so creative and wants you to be delighted. He gives me tastings of everything he thinks I'll like. The place may be a little dated, but I don't care. The look may not be fresh but the fish sure is."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars i would. Awful awful awful service!  Food was just OK.  Waitress was unbelievably rude.  We finally cancelled our order after waiting over 20 minutes (there were hardly any other people in the restaurant) and they hadn't even started it. I had to actually walk up to the waitress at the counter because she ignored us the whole time.  Don't waste your time when there's a million other sushi restaurants in town."}
{"text":"First time here... The atmosphere was pleasant. We were ordering to go. We aren't sure if the waitress was having a bad day, but she didn't even greet us. She told us to sit and walked away. After ordering, she ignored us until she brought us our food. I would've like to order a drink while we waited but never got a chance to do that.   The food was good overall; some rolls were just okay, my teriyaki beef was amazing. But, even after repeating my order back to me, when I got it, part of it was wrong.   Because of the food, we will try this place again. We're hoping the waitress was just having an off night."}
{"text":"I've had two completely different experiences here!  1st experience: Word to the wise: NEVER COME FOR LUNCH.  It wasn't busy yet when our party of two came in for lunch. She seated us, but we had to flag her down to take our orders for food and drink. The young hostess/server took 25mins to bring our table of two water(we had to remind her) & over 30mins for our food!!! She did not apologize for the wait at all or for bringing our drinks late. I ordered 1 roll and my co-worker ordered 1 lunch special. If it wasn't for us having to flag her down every time we would've taken over an hour on our lunch break. My roll was delish, but not worth the horrid service. That was the worst service I have ever experienced.   2nd experience(for late happy hour): Decided to give this place a second chance with my husband. Boy I felt like I was in a different restaurant! It was fairly busy. The server was different, taller and much more nicer. We enjoyed the happy hour menu but HAD to order my favorite roll that was not part of happy hour. All good. The portions are pretty big as well! My husband and I will definitely comeback, but only late at night, never for lunch!"}
{"text":"Fresh sushi at reasonable price. Great happy hour selections, clean restaurant and friendly staff. I like to sit at the bar and interact with the chef, chef Su is very nice, makes us special sushi and makes us feel welcome and appreciated. The Salmon skin salad and salmon belly sushi was amazing. Got too full on happy hour menu, but will definitely go back to try their Uni. So far so good!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Las Vegas.  Eric, one of the sushi chefs is amazing.  So much talent  and so delicous!    The chefs are so creative that your sushi dishes look like a work of art.  The fish is high quality and very, very fresh.  The wait staff are so friendly.   I love this place!"}
{"text":"This place has excellent, high quality sushi. Everything from their appetizers to their specialty rolls! I loved the Dark Horse and Red Rock. Their salmon sashimi is also extremely fresh and tasty. Also, to top it off, the service is exceptional. We were there during happy hour and were extremely well taken care of. Tip: go during happy hour - 3 to 6 p.m."}
{"text":"Been here once and everything was great.  We had the kobe sushi, lobster handroll, uni, hawaiian tuna poke, sweet shrimp and everything was really fresh & good~ Tap came to around 70 for all of the above and it was a great value for sushi bar~   Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The rating tells.  This is a great sushi place in a hole.  Whenever I come to Vegas, this is the place I don't skip.  Yeah, it is a drive from strip but still... Quite honestly, my Sushi buds were trained in Gardena, California (Toyota, Nissan, etc HQ reside right there... you can imagine the level of competition for Sushi place there) And for non all you can eat place to satisfy me does take a LOT. Eric the sushi chef is such an awesome character and creative sushi chef!  He can be wacky at times, can be hilarious, or just friendly as you can get.  But one thing is always certain, he delivers the goodies for your taste buds. Rolls here are just extra ordinary! Beyond 5 stars.  I would rate non-roll sushi typically from 3.5-4.5 stars.  The experience as whole just combines this place as one of the best sushi place you can pick in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"a friend recommanded i try this place out.  loved the rolls. there were so many varieties. the presentation was beautiful and  also very delicious. the sushi was very fresh. would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My 4 year old niece asked me for sushi at 10:55am lol. I was in a a neighborhood I wasn't familiar with so I yelped nearest sushi opening at 11am. Its located right by Kelly Cardenas. I got salmon nigiri. It was decent. I asked the sushi chef what roll didn't have imitation crab. I DO NOT EAT THAT NASTY STUFF. He recommended paradise roll. Again, it was decent. Little fishy tasting. I just feel this place is lackluster. Meh."}
{"text":"This place literally has the best sushi I've ever had!! The tuna sashimi was excellent, even though it was only  three pieces, they are very large. We also had the sexy monkey roll which was to die for, along with the hot special roll. Im telling you, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"This place is not bad but they forgot my moms tempura udon soup. Everyone in the restaurant received there food except for my mom, especially the people that came after us and ordered received their food first. This place does not have a good customer service."}
{"text":"Not the worst sushi but definitely better fresher options in town. This is close to my home so for convenience I've been here a few times but after my last experience not sure if I will be going back, they were busy so I get that you can't be completely attentive throughout our whole meal but we felt like the staff was rudely ignoring us. Maybe because we had our young son with us, not sure. They need more staff for weekends and the food is a 3 star in my opinion."}
{"text":"I came back today with my cousin and they changed a new server which is very good although he is still learning. So I'm going to change the review back to five stars. Lol"}
{"text":"I love this place. Friendly staff, knowledgeable chefs that will teach you about Sushi. Great food and inexpensive for the quality of product."}
{"text":"A comeback kid. I came here years ago and it smelled like dead fish. But not in a normal good sushi way. I decided to return and ordered the Touchdown among other things. I'll be back for sure. Fish was great, generous plates, normal music."}
{"text":"Oh my WOW!!!!! This place is INCREDIBLE, Just got back from having lunch and was sooooo impressed. Everything was wonderful, the staff was friendly, the presentation was awesome the flavor was delicious but most of all the fish was very fresh.  We will definately be regulars here! LOVED IT!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy I found Hodaido Sushi on Yelp!  My guy & I had such a beautiful meal here, and yes, I mean beautiful.  Every dish came out decorated, like something out of \"Iron Chef\".  The service was amazing, too.  We tend toward the \"Kosher\" fish... salmon, whitefish, tuna, halibut... and we were completely happy with all of our selections.  Everything was so fresh!     When even the sake tastes better than your old sushi place, you know it's time to make a change.  We'll definitely be heading back to Hokaido soon.    Thanks, Yelp community!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to stumble into their happy hour and order myself a philly roll. It was $3 and I was expecting my typical, boring, philly roll but honestly it was the best one I've ever had. I'm kicking myself for not ordering a full ($4). I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"So far waited 30 minutes and no drinks just sitting here with water one waitress four tables.. got our cucumber salads at 35 minutes.. soup came after our rolls. Drinks came at 40 minutes. This place is super close to our house but we won't be back. There was one waitress who was clearly overwhelmed. Save your money, pay a little more for better food and better service."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour with several friends. Service was pretty good for the most part. Seems most of the rolls on happy hour have shrimp tempura in them. Something to help fill you up & not give you alot of other options of internal ingredients on a roll. Nigiri was good. Had the garlic tuna, salmon belly & super white tuna. Tried the Paradise roll - it was good even though it was shrimp tempura inside. Had asked for fresh wasabi & waitress never informed me there was a charge for it - wished she would have been up front about that. I've ordered fresh wasabi many times & never been charged extra for it so I had no idea that places do charge extra for it - I guess whatever they have to do to make a buck.I'd go back again for happy hour time only."}
{"text":"Kid friendly. Ordered the munchkins chicken teriyaki bento boxes which included miso soup, fruit, salad and shrimp tempura. For desert they had green tea mochi ice cream.  I ordered oysters. The size was too huge for my liking. I noticed oysters are deliciously creamy at a small to medium size. The oysters I had were huge and had a salty fish taste to it. The rest of my order included Salmon Belly, Toro, Red Snapper,  Salmon with yuzo kosho, yellow tail and yellow tail belly all as sushi/nigiri because it fits my budget. This meal was a treat from my dear sister Liza Calove. Thank you Liz."}
{"text":"All I gotta say is this place is awesome. I'm an outta towner that's curious about local scenes and found gold at this decent sushi place. Ladies and gent, this place is it. The ambience is awesome and the sushi chef actually converse and tries to cater sushi to your liking. The pricing is reasonable. Granted this place is not an AYCE, but excellent fresh sushi should be enjoyed in moderation and not in excess.  Great place, great people, fresh fish and excellent ambience from the sushi chef. Highly recommend for anyone looking to experience sushi outside of the Strip."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! One of the best in town! Highly recommend! Sushi rolls perfectly made every time. Great Happy Hour too!"}
{"text":"I love eating at Hokaido Sushi Bar in Summerlin.     Eric the sushi chef makes dishes for me not on the menu all the time. Most times he just takes some of my favorite seafoods and makes me something very delicious. I go wash my hands and he has something for me.  They don't skimp on portions or ingredients. I love love love octopus, and they always give me more than anywhere else.  Consistently GREAT sushi, attentive wait staff, plenty of parking .... and ERIC"}
{"text":"I think Naked Fish has a new contender for my favorite sushi roll place.  Hokaido is another surprise in the 'burbs sushi place that had really tasty rolls and fresh fish.  We all shared: 1.  Ultimate Tuna 2.  Three Alarm Fire 3.  Almost Crazy Tuna  All three rolls were fantastically flavorful and well done.  Just enough sauce to rice to fish ratio's.  A bonus was that the uni was unbelievably eye rolling fresh (on a Saturday)!!!!  Conclusion:  I will be back to enjoy more sushi rolls!"}
{"text":"came for HH, nice service, food good. California roll, spicey crab and tiger roll. good quality food. I was in the area so stopped by on a quiet Tuesday. no crowd at 2pm. started to get busy later. take out service looked brisk tool  may return if in that area of LV."}
{"text":"Sushi/sashimi was fine, not spectacular, although they have a very extensive menu of rolls and some rice free rolls, which is more up my alley.  Kind of pricey for what you get.  The special blue fin tuna sashimi, was $22.00 and I think we were served less than one ounce of fish. I've had blue fin at other good sushi places, got more and paid less.  Rip.   No AYCE, but a Lunch Menu ranging $13- $16 is good for classic roll lovers that also want miso, salad, and rice included."}
{"text":"Previously gave this place 4 stars only because the servers are always nice and the nigiri tastes great. BUT happy hour menu is limited, rolls are nothing special, and last time I went it was not busy at all, and our orders of 4 nigiri took a good 20+ minutes. When we finally got it, they had wasabi on all of them, which they never have done before. I hate wasabi and had to scrape it off. They should really think about expanding their HH menu or offering AYCE and make sure the chefs are consistent."}
{"text":"Used to be 4 stars now it went down over time. Sushi options are limited in this area. They used to do this beautiful fancy presentation of each sushi dish. It was unique and fun to look at the design. I always felt they were on the pricier side though.   The last couple times I went here that presentation no longer exists. The nigiri sushi was PAPER thin and mainly rice. I've never seen sushi cut so thin. Rip off."}
{"text":"Thank you to Christine, the manager and the staff of Hokkaido for making me such a wonderful lunch. I received a call from her letting me know she was aware of what happened and apologized and offered to comp me lunch today. I placed my order on the way there and she let me know the timeframe. I arrived and received my order shortly after. She was very nice and apologized again and my food is amazing!! She even called me after to check to make sure I was happy. Thank you Christine!!"}
{"text":"Found a crawling mystery bug in my salad, not a tiny bug either, half a dime size I'd say. Waitress was embarrassed and shocked, but not shocked enough apparently, she still charged us for our drinks. Never going back again. Still get the shivers from that. I wanted to like the place and it doesn't seem dirty, it could have been a random incident. But again, not going to chance it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place! Food is fresh and the sushi chefs make beautiful food!"}
{"text":"Coming here to eat atleast 2-3 times a week, great sushi and great service low prices compare to other places. Can actually get full with $30 for 2 persons.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"We are pretty much a regular here, at least the waiter knows us each time we go in. :) We enjoyed their unique sushi rolls and their presentation are top notch, I really don't care about the AYCE places because I look for the quality of the fish/sushi not by how much I can stuff down.   So, Hokaido Sushi is rank up there next to Naked Fish.   I give it 4 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, I came in here yesterday to give it a try and all was great. The service was excellent with a friendly atmosphere. I had a little chat with the chef Rocky and he seems like a really cool guy. The waiter was helpful the whole time and was very attentive. I looked through the menu and made a few orders with one being recommended by the waiter, and I can't say enough of how satisfying the food was. Its now one of my favorite sushi restaurant to go to. Will be back again soon."}
{"text":"We go here at least once a month. A good selection of interesting sushi. Late night happy hour starts at 10pm. 1/2 price on 1/2 size sushi, but it's the beer prices that make happy hour worth it."}
{"text":"This is, by far, an awesome sushi restaurant! I love the food, I love the service! Eric, one of the sushi chefs, is a character. He is so nice and kept us entertained. Soo, another sushi chef, is also very nice and friendly. I can't wait to bring my family and freinds here. I really like the Dark Horse sushi. But every sushi Eric made for us was yummy!"}
{"text":"1 st time here and last time here . We just left there and and we are upset , we ordered 2 rolls to start. The rolls on the menu say inside the roll is soft shell crab and on top is soft shell crab. With fish on top .  Well no soft shell crab in the rolls at all.  When I asked the chef about it he said it comes with the imitation crab . That's when I showed him the menu where it shows what's in the rolls.  He says , hold on and goes to talk to the other guy , which I 'm guessing he might be the owner... so he comes back gives me this story about how expensive soft shell crab is and that no sushi place will put soft shell crab inside the rolls which is not true.  We also ordered the something wrong roll which again they put imitation crab in as well.  I wouldn't go back if it was free."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that it only has ONE vegetarian sushi roll. It's a delicious vegetable tempura roll, but I would appreciate a little more variety for the non-meat-eating crowd.   They do deliver, which is unusual for sushi places. The restaurant is never very busy, so take-out and eat-in orders are very speedy. Plus, the associates are very kind."}
{"text":"Love this place, it's about time I write a review because this is my third time here! it has happy hour everyday 2-5pm and 9pm-close. Ordered the miso soup and garlic edamame to start with, all delicious. Got Yellowtail sashimi, Alaskan roll, Paradise roll, Hawaiian roll, all on the happy hour menu, $8-$10 range for 8 pieces under the special rolls. For the classic roll we ordered Philadelphia roll $4.95. Among 4 of us this was plenty of food. We ended the meal with mochi, yummy! I'm going to be a regular here!"}
{"text":"Pros: close to home, easy parking, food is excellent. Fried rice, gyoza, veg tempura and Cali roll were soooo good. Maybe best I've had on west side of town.  Cons:  service for takeout is slow. I placed an order online, 20 minutes. I got there in 20 minutes, waited 5 minutes for someone to greet me, paid/tipped, told to sit and wait. And wait. 30 minutes later I got my order. Place wasn't that busy just poor mgmnt. Other customers that left got a cheery thank you & goodbye. Me, nadda. They must not care about us lowly picker uppers tho my tab was &35.   Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Good sushi, good service, cute decor and very conveniently located for me. Their rolls (dragon roll and dark horse) are tasty, the fish seems fresh but their hand rolls are pretty boring. I recently asked for a custom hand roll. It tasted great! Spicy tuna, Spicy crab, Avocado, Tempura shrimp, Rice or scallops w/soy paper."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get sushi, ever! It's extremely fresh, delicious and always pretty timely service. Good music and vibes. I come here at least once a week!! Special shout out to ELLIE  and Jenny for always giving the best service. I love hokaidos!!!"}
{"text":"The food was great and very fresh.  They have an incredible selection of sushi.  The prices are very reasonable.  We ordered two types of sushi (Lobster Roll and Caterpillar) and a bowl of rice and it was delicious.  We sat at the bar and the guy that made the sushi and another worker were so friendly.  We can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Something wrong 69!  One of my favorite rolls at Hokaido.  I haven't eaten at the physical location recently, but we have had take out... & it's just as good.    It's pretty fresh for Las Vegas sushi.  Lots of rolls to choose from, sashimi, as well as the usual Japanese bento entree options: chicken/beef/salmon teriyaki, Katsu, taba shiyoyaki, etc..   Some of my favorites: Philly crunch,  the sweetheart roll, the Mexican roll, yellowtail and tuna sashimi, and of course something's wrong 69.   It is not all you can eat.  I remember that it used to be, but I guess that's changed.  There are lots of appetizers to choose from... but the garlic edamame & gyoza are my 1st choices.    They offer combos- a good one is 19.95 for two choice rolls + a rainbow roll.  Good for two ppl.      The spot itself is not a big place, but there's lots of seating with booths and counter seating where you can of course watch the sushi chefs do work.    The waitresses are helpful...sometimes.  I only say sometimes because most of the time it's a translation game.  They are very attentive and polite though.    All in all, a good sushi place in the local area."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the sashimi/sushi but the rolls here are good. I would recommend this place if you like to order rolls but try elsewhere if you are a sashimi/nigiri person"}
{"text":"The freshest sushi in town. There isn't anything I've ever had here that I wouldn't recommend!"}
{"text":"Oishi des!  Very fresh sushi & sashimi. The spicy ramen was extra spicy, as per request"}
{"text":"My Fav Sushi spot in Summerlin! Try there chef specials or the chalkboard menu. Clean and fast"}
{"text":"Made a 20 minute trek from the Las Vegas Strip with my GF b/c of the Yelp review.  What a terrible mistake! I wish I can give this place a 0 star, but... We sat at the bar.  Place was less than 1/3 full.  It took about 50 minutes to get:  Amaebi; Salmon Martini; agadashi tofu; a bowl of steam rice (last 2 from kitchen), the rest of the order; Ikura; Hokaido Roll, Miso soup, etc.. was completely forgotten by the sushi guy and waitress... the food was mediocro at MOST!  I felt so BAD that I took my GF when we came up from So. Cal.  This is the abosolute WORST experience we both had.  In fact, we went back to our hotel room and I had to make instant noodle to round out my dinner!  This place SHOULD NOT be in business.  It's the MOST horrible experience, EVER!  For those of you that gave this dump more than 2 stars:  SHAME ON YOU for misleading people that rely on Yelp.  That is unless, you are used to eating dirt and scrubs in the desert of LV and honestly don't know any better!  For everyone else:  STAY AWAY!  you are better off... Well, with instant noodle with a bit of hot sauce."}
{"text":"I've eaten at several dozens of sushi restaurants in Las Vegas over the years ranging from affordable AYCE to super expensive and traditional... this was one of the best all around sushi dining experiences I've had ever:  - Quality fish - Excellent presentation - Reasonable prices - Nice selection of rolls - Clean environment - Friendly staff.  When you have a 5 star experience why go anywhere else?"}
{"text":"Good sushi, great service, huge menu.  We will definitely be back.  Hope the beer is colder next time."}
{"text":"We are regulars for over 3 years, once a week we would come here and eat sushi. The service has declined a lot. We were just there a couple weeks ago and we had terrible service. We were the only people there, they had two waitresses and one sushi chef. Took forever to get refills and our check. I had to seek out the waitress to get our check, only to find her chit chatting with a fellow co-worker. I waited a bit before I had to stop her mid-sentence to ask for our check.  Plus side, the sushi is fantastic, delicious and fresh. The staff are friendly and the waitress is nice, she remembered us every time we came in.  Deal breaker-Service! You can only deal so much with bad service. Especially, when we were the only people in the restaurant, there is no reason for such terrible service. We have given this place multiple chances hoping the service would change."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I love it. The sushi rolls are good and they have cool pretentious names like \"what the hell\" and \"who's your daddy\" (I'm not gonna order a roll that's named \"Jonathan\" unless it's named after Jonathan Ogden). They also have a happy hour (cheap sushi, I'm in). Bento boxes for lunch are nice too. The only problem is they don't have all you can eat, but the prices are still reasonable, so I don't leave feeling like a fat whore."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic sushi place... every meal is served to perfection... each meal a work of art... LOVE it."}
{"text":"Great place, typical sushi joint. They are fresh and very hospitable. Prices are ok as well. Come here if you are near by but don't go across town for it."}
{"text":"I went here last night with a local friend who also hadn't been before and found everything except one dish to be fantastic. I'll start with the outlier: the mango salmon roll tasted fine, but was bland. There, with that out of the way, on to the awesome. We were going to order fried tofu originally, but the helpful chaps behind the sushi bar steered us towards the house made tofu, which was delicious and had a nice consistency. After that arrived our sushi. Eel and yellowtail nigiri were both fresh and flavorful. The ultimate tuna roll, served over a light sauce, was decadent, and definitely the best dish of the night. The \"monkey brain\" my friend ordered, which thankfully was nothing like the images from an Indiana Jones movie that I conjured, was also terrific. We opted for some vanilla and strawberry mochi ice cream for dessert. My friend's sadness at them being out of vanilla turned to joy after we tried the chocolate peanut butter instead, which tasted a lot like a Reese's cup. Overall a really nice place with friendly staff and excellent food, and being located in a quieter neighborhood on the southwest side of the city is a nice respite from the bustle of the strip."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying sushi because I've always been convinced that I hate seafood.  However, I decided to give it a go because I have been warming up to shrimp and crab recently.  My fear about sushi is that it will be \"fishy\" in taste.  The fish here was so fresh that it practically melted in my mouth and tasted better than I expected!  The chef was not super talkative or anything (we sat at the sushi bar), which was fine by me.  Try the Something Wrong #69... delicious!"}
{"text":"The best sushi Restaurant in town. Service is excellent and fast."}
{"text":"The Skinny: oxidized, fishy albacore tuna, dry tonkatsu and hard veggie tempura (2) Service: was okay - only problem was the ambience was poor due to a rather loud table across the room (3), value: around $17 for the bento box which isn't bad but given the quality will not likely return.(2)  Not sure what to order, our table decided to order 3 bento boxes to have some variety. On the list of things we tried: grilled saba, california roll, albacore tuna sashimi, tonkatsu, tuna sashimi, salmon sashimi, and veggie tempura. Each bento came with salad, rice and miso soup.  The sides of miso soup, salad, california roll were all okay - nothing special. The grilled saba was good.  The albacore sashimi was pretty bad. There were 5 thinly sliced, grey, mushy, watery pieces of fish with a very strong fishy odour. Certainly not good quality. The salmon sashimi was not cut in the proper manner and appeared like rectangular blocks. The tuna sashimi was okay.   My husband's tonkatsu was poor. Pounded too thin and likely using meat that doesn't have enough fat content, it caused the end product to be too dry and hard.   The veggie tempura was difficult to eat, greasy and unpleasantly hard.  I'm not sure if it was how we ordered or what we ordered but I didn't enjoy the food very much here. If you do decide to go, I think you should try ordering a la carte instead. Either way, this place gets a two star review."}
{"text":"I was craving some sushi rolls nothing exotic just some solid yummy rolled sushi. I yelped and saw this place had some good reviews. My husband and I walked in around 730 Monday evening there were a few people sitting at the sushi bar and only one server. We ordered screaming orgasm I usually don't like this dish it's my husbands fav but theirs was really really good my husband fend kept the sauce afterwards to dip everything in haha. Paradise roll was great, yellowtail maki was not that great I didn't like how the yellowtail was chopped up to the point it was mushy. Salmon skin roll was crispy and great!!! This place reminds me of I love sushi in Henderson Korean owned and very good!!!! Since it's so close to the house we will def be back soon!"}
{"text":"not as good as it used to be. quality of the fish has downgraded a tad if you are looking for straight sashimi. but if you are looking for delicious rolls, this totally is the place to go!"}
{"text":"My Son and I LOVE THIS PLACE!!  Rocky even makes me a special vegetarian roll :))   AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour, dishes are good and prices are very reasonable.  Definitely recommend this place, service at he bar is great, chefs are very attentive and provide help in case you need it."}
{"text":"3stars all for food only. No service......If you looking for good food but dont care bad service, then it is still worth."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is one of the best places to get fresh fish in Vegas. Their sashimi is amazing and the sushi chefs go above and beyond their calling - always making efforts to get unique types of fish and ensuring that whatever they have is of the best quality.   This is not an AYCE sushi joint and that is part of the reason I like it so much. At many AYCE places, the sushi becomes less special. The chefs often don't spend as much time on the rolls or don't put a whole lot of fish in the rolls.   These guys make AMAZING rolls. The flavors are always different from what you will find at most sushi places in Vegas. Something about this place just makes me feel happy and comfortable and not rushed or bombarded with 900 different options for sushi. The wait staff is friendly and efficient. The sushi chefs are so talented and also extremely entertaining.   Give this place a shot. You may spend more than you would at an AYCE restaurant, but it is worth it in freshness and flavor!"}
{"text":"Aside from their great sushi rolls and chef's nigiri choices they have great Poke bowls and ramen noodles.  My favorite is their spicy seafood ramen which is not too spicy but has a very flavorful broth.  The Poke bowls are served with a large portion of fish and choice of greens or rice.  The service at times may be a little slow but for me the food is worth the wait.  Plus the wait staff is so nice and polite.  Check this stop out and enjoy."}
{"text":"The food here is always delicious.  The wait staff greets you when you walk in and are very accommodating.  They are not quick at bringing your check so if you are there on a lunch break make sure you ask for it early.   Be weary when they charge you. The lady added an extra 7 to the end which made her charge me 107.77 in stead if 10.77. Yes she voided it, but it took 4 days with the weekend and all. So be careful."}
{"text":"All around this place is awesome.  They have a fantastic staff, and the food is always presented in an amazing way.  Not to mention I have not had one thing here that was not good."}
{"text":"BEST HAPPY HOUR EVER!! Starts at 9 and has the cheapest but tastiest rolls ever. The service is fast and the servers are so polite. We drive across town just to eat at this happy hour"}
{"text":"This sushi joint is SOOOOO good that they never lost business during the economic crunch. That says something."}
{"text":"Best sushi spot in vegas by FAR!!! Eric, Soo, and JJ are amazing chefs and make everything like a piece of art. Its the type of place you go and people are taking pictures of the plates.  You walk in and are greeted by Eric yelling HAAAASHHHAAAI from behind the bar.  The rolls are all amazing and fresh, but the best thing to do is just sit at the bar and leave your ordering in the hands of Eric, and JJ.  Just let them make something and you will not leave anything short of satisfied.  Make sure you order a sake bomb with Eric, and watch him smash it for you, its worth the price alone."}
{"text":"We had a craving for sushi and decided to try Hokaido for the first time. They looked fantastic. I gave 3 stars because they didn't have the right taste. I think it was their cream cheese...only Philadelphia Cream Cheese is acceptable! Seriously though they were good, but change the cream cheese and add some more cucumber and they could be GREAT!"}
{"text":"Love their happy hour specials!   Their special fish of the day is always good. Shima Aji is great.   They have my favorite age dashi tofu as well.  Light and crisp coating with delicious broth.  Generous portions."}
{"text":"This is a typical/average sushi spot for Vegas..nothing special enough to require your attention or motivate you make it out here specifically, but the casual sushi eater (California Roll, Philadelphia Roll, Spicy Tuna, etc.) will have no problem enjoying themselves here.  On the plus side the sushi chefs here are personable and fun."}
{"text":"I need to write a review to this place, not for the food, which was perfectly fine, but because of the sushi chef. I am in love with the friendliness he showed and how willing he is for appealing to different tastes. We came in late at night looking for a place we could have some soup and a couple of drinks. I was not disappointed. Yes we didn't end up getting soup, but instead I was able to convince my boyfriend that sushi is delicious. The sushi chef helped us by recommending kind of like a surf and turf sushi which was delicious. Then he made a spicy jalape√±o roll for my boyfriend which was a bit too spicy for me, but he made it up by suggesting his take on what I am used to calling a crunchy roll. Overall I had a lot of fun and the food was yummy. The prices are a bit pricy but it is worth it. My advise would be sit at the bar. Way better atmosphere and you get to interact with the chef!"}
{"text":"Decadent Sushi Rolls, Fresh Fish & Soju  HUGE rolls, decorated for a Yelp King/Queen.  When you're looking for beautiful sushi this is definitely a place that comes to mind.  On the menu or off of the menu Eric is a sushi artist who knows how to make your taste-buds dance.    The restaurant isn't as cozy as some of the other Las Vegas Sushi Spots, but the food more than makes up for any lack of ambiance.  Go for a hike, check out the mountains, and come here to rest your feet and fill your tummy.   Date Rating: 6 Pick up Scale: 1  Strong Suggestion: Sit at the sushi bar and hang out with Eric. There may only be a handful of reviews for this spot but I've been a California/NYC sushi snob for years - you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The BEST sushi in town!! We have been here once and I totally forgot to write a review about how amazing the place is.. But we are here now and again the service and food is amazing!! Our favorite here are the caterpillar roll, the sweetheart roll and the Japanese lasagna roll. Our waitress also remembered what we ordered last time after only being here once.. What a nice feeling!!"}
{"text":"Verdict: Good happy hour, great food and as of this writing; their service game has stepped up--which earns them a solid 4-star rating in my book!  If you're looking for a quiet spot to grab some good sushi and don't mind waiting from time to time for your food, then this is your joint!   They used to be much slower at bringing out food even when they had 2 chefs on deck, two servers and no one else to serve but you and your boo in the room--kinda sad. But now, that's a thing of the past and since we've been back, they've upped their service game and I can appreciate their newfound hustle.   Quick tip: Order a spicy scallop hand roll or two and thank me later for your new favorite sushi go-to order."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Service was great. Very attentive. The chef that was cooking for us was pretty funny. The food came quicker than I anticipated which was a plus. The best part is that they are located right by my house. I will be returning."}
{"text":"The wife and I come here all the time and the food is always great and the service is spectacular!!!!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place a few months ago and I'm here about once a week. I actually just checked my credit cards and I've been here 25 times since July. I I haven't once had a bad experience here. I always sit at the bar and it's usually during happy hour after 9pm where it stays happy hour until closing (1am). Rocky and Sam are awesome and it seems they're here most of the time. There are a ton of regulars here as I noticed most people are on a first name basis with them. Everyone is constantly feeding them beer or sake. It's amazing they still have all their fingers intact with those super sharp knives :)  This is my favorite sushi place in LV anywhere remotely in this price range. The quality is superior to any of the AYCE places I've been to and I still walk out under 40 bucks on average with tip and I can eat.  Some of my favorites here: The garlic edamame appetizer is awesome...and SUPER garlicky if you're down with that. Monica roll (lobster, shrimp, tuna, avocado on soy topped in crispy onion) Dark Horse if you like crab Hawaiian if you like tuna Zion Canyon if you liked baked rolls Cajun albacore sashimi Live scallop (when they have it)"}
{"text":"I always try something new when I go here and I am never let down. The spicy garlic edamame is delicious. Gyoza's are great, we ordered a second one they were that good. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Chef Eric and Chef JJ are awesome.  They may not have AYCE, but they still get my business.  Their rolls are so delicious!  I get the Heart Scream, Dark Horse and 300 Rolls.  Chef Eric also makes a special Tuna hand roll.  The sashimi is good to.  They give you your money's worth.  It's not sliced paper thin like at some other places.  This is my go-to place when I want sushi."}
{"text":"I was around this area looking for a sushi fix when I yelped and saw all the great reviews for this place. The reviews are pretty much on the dot too.  Hokaido has the kind of quality food and fish from a higher-class sushi restaurant--the kind that usually reside on the strip--but have hole-in-the-wall sushi joint prices.  Their list of rolls is pretty impressive and affordable, and the actual entrees are decent too. My cousin and I shared a shrimp tempura roll along with our bento boxes ($7.95 for a kids bento box is a steal by the way) which actually came with a lot of food. I chose the two-item bento box for $11.95 and had some of the best vegetable tempura I've ever had in a Las Vegas sushi place. I'm a big fan of tempura and tend to order it whenever I try a new sushi place and this tempura batter was top-notch.  Much lighter, crispier, and done well but not too well done. No soggy spots and it wasn't dripping in oil either. Pretty much just yum-tastic.   The spicy tuna roll that came with my bento was okay, I've had far better spicy tuna at Sushi Wa, but this wasn't far off the mark. I think the tuna may have been a little on the ripe side, but it wasn't anything I couldn't handle. I've noticed that Las Vegas sushi places rarely have the kind of fresh fish I've had at coastal sushi restaurants, which is obvious since we live in a desert. But the spicy factor wasn't too overbearing, which I appreciated since I've been to way too many sushi joints where they over flavor the fish to the point where you can't even tell what kind of fish you're having.   Overall it was a really great place with really great prices. I hope to return soon to try more of their creative sushi concotions."}
{"text":"The place is really nice.  Beautiful and clean.    The service was ok.  The problem is that the communication between the server and us wasn't so good.  We asked few times to not put shrimps in the rolls and we got two rolls with shrimps.   Also prices are a little high."}
{"text":"With moving to the other side of town, it was nice to find a new sushi spot near by. Service and rolls are great. Plus, they have a great happy hour that has options of 4-8 pieces. It gives you the option to try a lot of different rolls. All in all, it's a nice little spot and I've loved everything I've tried. Nice place as my last one was I Love Sushi."}
{"text":"In the mood for Sushi...tired of the same spot, tried something new and I'm glad I did. Thanks to my fellow YelperZ I tried out Hokaido. I ordered the Dark Horse roll. It looked like this roll was made with love...like the chef knew me personally. Soft...a little crunch...and was available in brown rice which I love. I will be checking in again...most likely tomorrow...cuz I'm fat. Lol"}
{"text":"Left an all day meeting, getting ready to go to the airport and was craving sushi so I did a Yelp search.  This restaurant was about a mile from my office. It was nice to find a sushi restaurant that is still open at 2 PM. Sushi restaurants are usually closed between 2-5 pm. I ordered two specialty rolls and a sea urchin sushi. The specialty rolls were good at about $12 each so it's average. The sea urchin was very expensive, $10 for two pieces.  The waitress told me it was \"special\" that it was flown in from Japan. However, it tasted just like the normal Sea urchin sushi I would get in any sushi place.  I will definitely go there again but not order the \"special\" sea urchin."}
{"text":"Excellent Sushi.  Specifically the rolls were tasty and menu made it easy to pick rolls that were out of the ordinary.  Typically you read the description and cross your fingers but here you not only have a great description but a picture as well.  Service was good and very friendly.  We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Met up with the family, pretty big group. They took care of us right away. Prices are very reasonable, place is very clean!"}
{"text":"We come here every time we are in Vegas and they never disappoint. Best udon I've ever had.. And the dark horse roll is superb! Service is also always on point."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place!  You can not go wrong with seafood in LV.  Because of their high demand, it is always fresh no matter where you go.  This place happens to be my favorite spot for 5yrs now.    My favorite sushi roll is The Red Mountain, ask for it with Jalapenos.  ;)  Enjoy, bitches!"}
{"text":"The Ebi Crunch was good, but I think I fell in love with the Sweet Heart.  It was fresh and sweet with the hint of grilled flavor."}
{"text":"I got take out from this place because it was close to the rental that I was staying at. I ordered the seaweed salad, the vega-tempura roll, and a cucumber roll. There was a miscommunication with the order, which was totally my fault because she read it back to me on the phone and I wasn't paying attention. When I got there and realized my order was wrong, they were so nice and replaced it immediately! When I got home and ate my food it was amazing! So fresh and delicious. One of the best veggie rolls i've had in a while!"}
{"text":"I killed an ant on the counter after I got my check for my food.. I'll never go back I threw up after.. They served the most skimp ass salmon nigiri and salmon hand roll that I have ever seen. Really nice people just horrible food and I killed a big on their sushi bar.. I WILL NEVER GO BACK  if I could give 0 stars I would"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed after trying this restaurant. Their food is nothing special besides the tacky artificial flower decoration on every sushi roll we ordered. I am so turned off by the artificial flower decoration because I don't want to think about them reusing it time after time.   The price is okay, but not great for what you get. We ordered a yellowtail collar, yellowtail carpaccio, touchdown roll, JJ's, and some other rolls. Yellowtail collar tasted the best, but the rest are bland or not memorable at all.  Even though the staff was nice and service was good, I probably won't go back again."}
{"text":"This was our first time there and we loved it!!! The sushi was great as well as the presentation! I wish they had all you can eat but that won't keep me away, everything was too good!"}
{"text":"I usually love this place every time I come here it's always good service good food. The service I got today was horrible! We ordered a teriyaki box for my son that's the first thing we ordered then we ordered from the happy hour menu maybe 5 rolls.  When she served our sushi we had no chop sticks so we asked if we could have some chop sticks. She comes back with one and we asked her if we could have another one because hello there's the two of us.  So we waited about 10-15 minutes and wondered when she was going to bring my sons teriyaki box because he was already getting fussy because he's hungry and we already finished one roll of our sushi. When it seemed like we waited another 10 minutes I got up and asked her about the teriyaki box and she gave me a blank stare like she didn't know what I was talking about so she says \"ok I'll put it in\". That pissed me off that was the first thing we ordered and she forgot to put it in. I told her never mind if you forgot but she kept repeating almost done. So after waiting another 10 minutes and btw we're already done with our sushi and my son didn't even had his food yet. We told the server we didn't want the chicken anymore and wanted our check so we could leave but here she comes with the chicken. It didn't look appetizing the chicken was burnt like they rush it. My son didn't want to eat cause it was hard and burnt. We paid and left. Won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Love this place you have many options to choose from other than sushi! You can order other entrees and the prices are reasonable I love thier happy hr menu! Will recommend my friends and family to come here!"}
{"text":"A small, traditional and cozy sushi spot located on Ft. Apache. I've been to many sushi places all over Las Vegas and Henderson. So I guess it would be safe to say that the quality and taste of the sushi here is one of the best in the Las Vegas Area. The food menu prices are decent. The service is great. The staff here is nice and polite, they do not rush you like some other places. There is not much that I can think of to really complain about. A 5 star rating is well deserved."}
{"text":"Fresh fish, great service, nice menu.  I love eating here.  I love the fact that you can tell Eddie or JJ to make whatever they want to and everything that comes out is awesome.  I do it omakase style for most things here.  I can't explain it any more than this:  YUM-O."}
{"text":"If you love sushi, this place is heaven! I am so glad I came across Hokaido because it is now my go-to sushi joint. I love the sushi chefs!!! They are AMAZING, I haven't even ordered off the menu the last couple times I have been there, I just let them make a one of a kind specialty roll and I have never been disappointed!   The sushi here is always good! The service is also very good. If you wanna impress someone take them here, the presentation of the sushi is phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"Order thru post mates (deilivery service) and the sushi had bone in it and it's not suppose to have any bone. They need to prepare it better especially if it's going out for delivery. But then again I was the lazy one who didn't want to drive to their establishment..."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi places I have found in Vegas. The staff is attentive and sweet. The food and service deserves 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant based on Yelp reviews. Decent atmosphere and service. Ordered typical food because family doesn't like to explore.   Seaweed salad, good flavor and portion.  Steamed Gyoza 5-6 on the plate. Very yummy according to my daughter.  She offered but we declined because she loves them.  Wifey ordered chicken katsu. Nice and crisp, not greasy and a good portion too!.   I ordered chicken teriyaki lightly charbroiled and flavored. Good sauce.   We also ordered caterpillar, crispy california and tekka maki rolls (oink!). I know, I know a lot of food for a family of three.  Forgot to mention, entrees came with miso soup and salad. Overall pretty good value and pretty authentic.  Try it, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"We LOVE Hokaido sushi.  The sushi here is so fresh.  The service is fantastic!  We always order off of the special board, and it does not disappoint.  They have a large roll menu, if that's your thing.  Our current favorite appetizer is the steak tataki.  My favorite sushi is the Kanpachi.  It's like butter. Whenever we ask our 6 year old what he wants for dinner, it's always sushi, at Hokaido!"}
{"text":"This place has really good sushi and ramen I recommend to everyone , I had there ramen pork pho and it was delicious,  my sister had the dragon roll and it came in a big portion size and was very good"}
{"text":"Amazing rolls. Super authentic. Welcoming environment. Priced Right. There's something for everybody; also, the bar serves as a community gathering space. Nothing but good vibes. I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"so far this is my favorite regular sushi place. regular as in i may go once a week. it's not expensive, it's normal priced. fresh sushi.  i've been craving okimo, and each time i've gone, they didn't have it. oh well, not going to dock them a star on that."}
{"text":"It may have changed ownership but this place turned from decent to terrible. My family and I go or take out at least 3x per month. We will not be going back. This past week I took out, and had to wait long after order was said to be ready.The rug was really dirty at the entrance and clearly had not been vacuumed for days. They wouldn't take my coupon because she said no manager was there to \"ok\" it. Got the food home and there was zero presentation. The ginger was all dried out, and the rolls were about 1/3 smaller than they had been in the past and smelled fishy.We ordered out usual appetizer and received something else. I called and they said I needed to bring the appetizer back to get credit. I did so the next day and he said they had closed out the night, so I have to wait to get it credited back to my card. No apology , nothing but rude and unconcerned."}
{"text":"530 on a Friday night, we walked in and waited for them to make a space at the sushi bar as it was covered with dirty dishes and it was filthy. The waitress had an attitude, walked up basically shoved all the dirty crap from one side to the other to make a space in the middle so we would be flanked by dirty piled up dishes. It was unsanitary, it was gross, and the waitress had a major attitude. And there was nobody in the restaurant, it was basically empty. If they can't keep up with their business in an empty restaurant what happens when it's full The last time we went the service was also poor, and added unsanitary conditions, we will not return"}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review to let you know that the sushi is amazing my frustration  was with the two sushi chefs.  I have eaten sushi here for years.  Maybe they were just having a rough night"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place, this is the ONLY sushi place I eat at...Fish is always fresh, reasonable prices good service"}
{"text":"Amazing and authentic ambiance. Friendly staff and the rolls were delicious and fresh. Made with extreme care and pride right in front of you. The wasabi was a little thin and weak for me but to my family it seemed just right. We will be back."}
{"text":"We came here probably 3 or 4 months ago and the bar was packed. The tables though were probably 1/4 occupied and the server told us that there was a 30-minute wait. In the end, since my bf was too hungry, we just left and went somewhere else.   Yesterday was a different story. When we came in on a Saturday night, we were surprised that only 1 table was occupied. My bf was seated right away and I came in 10 minutes after.   We tried the following: oyster shooters, hamachi kama, Bikini Roll, Red Rock Roll and Kiss my Ass Roll. We also tried some nigiris... Cajun Albacore, Hamachi, Super White Tuna and Maguro Tuna. The nigiris were good but not the best I've tasted. The Bikini and Red Rock rolls were delicious. Those two rolls were different. A must try when you visit Hokkaido. However, the Kiss my Ass was a disappointment. We did not like the gravy sauce that was drizzled on top of it. The hamachi Kama was decent size for the price and pretty good too.  The service was good. The server was very attentive on refilling our drinks and giving me pickled ginger. Though I am not sure if I can say this if the restaurant was half full."}
{"text":"CUTE LITTLE PLACE   The interior of the place is cute & small w/ a couple of tables & a sushi bar top to seat maybe 8 people at most. There were specials signs above the sushi bar & colorful lanterns above.   They have HH everyday 2pm - 5pm & RHH 9pm - close which is always a plus for me if I just wanna drive down the street to get a quick bite of something.   FANNY BAY OYSTER $2.50 - uhhh.... I was a bit disappointed w/ this one... IMHO I feel like the oyster was old or it was FANNY bay oysters... it had the distinct flavor that usually makes me dislike oysters that my parents usually love... & I have had FANNY bay before & I love them. =\   PREMIUM UNI SUSHI $14.50 - this was DERICIOUS! plus they give you a pretty large amount... but definitely a bit more pricey than other places we went to recently.  HH 8 PIECE CALI ROLL $3.50 - I was craving a California roll from the last time I ate sushi at NAKED sushi since they made it with crab stick instead if the blended crab & Mayo. I scarffed this roll down ahahahha  HH 4 PIECE AVO ROLL $1.95 - so cheap & can't go wrong w/ avocado rolls.   HH DBL SALMON ROLL $8.50 - so I will assume this was good.... because my other half scarffed it down before I could turn around to take a picture....  HH SALMON SUSHI $3.25 - the chef gave us the salmon belly part & it just melted right on your tongue.  I will definitely be back to try more stuff since we came here RIGHT AFTER we ate lunch next door... fat kid issues... ahahhahaha"}
{"text":"Hokaido Sushi has been around for years now.  I used to eat at their place pretty regularly and their food was awesome, but for reasons of eating healthy, I cut them out for a while... well their is brown rice now!  My wife finally got me to come here again and I was pleasantly surprised.  First of all, their lunch specials have improved.  The Lunch Box Special is 8.95 and your choice of meat (steak you add $1.00).   Brown rice is another substitute that you can get at another $1.00.  That brings lunch to over $10.00 per person, but the quality is very good and worth it!  I ordered the Lunch Box Special with Chicken and Beef and brown rice, my wife ordered the Lunch Box Special with double beef.  Both meals came with Miso Soup as an appetizer.  It included a nice salad, 4 pieces of California roll sushi, rice and your choice of meets.  We also ordered the Tuna Poki (Poke) which was very delicious and came with seaweed salad as well.    Very delicious.  The waitress was super nice.  The food came surprisingly fast!  She did forget to put in our brown rice order, but that was quickly remedied.  I guess I'll be putting this back in to my work lunch rotation for sure!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi spot in all of Vegas...and we have some great sushi establishments!!!!  Everything is amazing and fresh. It's hard not to give almost all sushi places in Vegas 5 stars, however, this one stands out from the pack! A truly must go"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the happy hour gives you delicious rolls at an amazing price. If your near this spot it is a must stop spot. Plus the roll names are funny."}
{"text":"I love this place! Fresh fish!!! And amazing rolls. Try the seared salmon sushi!!! And JJ is a great sushi chef. He works Thursdays-Monday's =) the service is great as well. Didn't have to wait long for my food or drinks."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best sushi house in Vegas!    Every time my girl and I come here they take really good care of us and the food is amazing!!  Never had a bad experience coming here."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's a little on the small side but it was quiet and cute. Luckily we came in around 4 PM and they have happy hour every day from 3 to 5 PM and then some other time I don't remember. There are rolls are fairly cheap and you can do half rolls instead of full rolls if you'd like.   The sushi came out on a cute boat and was beautifully decorated. Everything tasted fresh and was really good so there are no complaints here.  I think I will make this my new go to sushi joint if I'm just eating by my house."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of sushi restaurants all over the U.S. and this one stands out as one of the best. Went here with some friends and we pretty much had the place to ourselves on a Friday night, I don't understand how, because this place should be jamming all the time in Vegas. Excellent service and wonderfully scrumptious sushi! I'd highly recommend checking this place out while in town. Totally worth the drive."}
{"text":"Well I got a job yesterday (yay!)  and we wanted to celebrate (yay!) and stay close to home, so we went to another place that will not be named because I am going to give them another chance.  We waited 20 minutes without being acknowledged or even given water.  So for the first time in my life I walked out, the manager chased after us and offered 50 percent off our whole meal if we came back.  We told him we'd come back another time, and we will.  However I had to tell this story to preface what an odd night this was.  Things didn't start off well at Hokaido, the host yelled at us in an extremely loud voice when we first got in and then our waitress rushed us on drink and appetizer orders before we had a chance to breathe(you can see how this night was starting off weird for us).  We were ready to order drinks and did, then we felt rushed to order something else so we ordered Miso soups.  The soups were great, she then gave us more time to figure out what to order.  We ordered quite a bit of food and for the most part it was really good.    The boy ordered a bento box with salmon sashimi and chicken katsu.  He received tuna sashimi.  Tuna is good and he liked it but it's kind of odd.  I ordered hamachi sashimi, 2 rolls and what is basically their take on jalapeno poppers.  We then asked if they had fresh wasabi, she said they did but they would have to charge us.    -My hamachi sashimi was very poorly cut, the blood line was left on it and it was a rather thick slab.  I'm used to hamachi tasting like butter but this was so big and bulky and the blood line made it taste a little off. -My rolls were nice, I had the double hamachi which was just ok and the Mexican roll which was very good.   -The Jalapeno \"poppers\" were probably my favorite.  They are stuffed with spicy tuna and cream cheese, tempura battered and fried with a nice sweet sauce.  They aren't super cooked, they are kind of crunchy still and very yummy.  I recommend this for sure.  The big issue was with their \"fresh wasabi\" that they charged us $2 for.  IT WASNT FRESH WASABI!  It looked like grated jalapenos or seranos with maybe some wasabi powder in it.  It was wet and had seeds in it, not what fresh wasabi looks like.  If you don't have something, tell us, don't pretend you have it.  This is very bad and makes me not want to go back there again even though it is close and the rest of the meal was ok.  I need to process my feelings about the meal before I decide if I can go there again."}
{"text":"I have two Favourite restaurants, one Thai one Japanese....This without a doubt trumps every other sushi or japanese and quite possibly Asian restaurant I've ever been too.   Up until 5 months ago I had never tried sushi before and this was my virgin experience...and I was hooked instantly. I have since tried sushi in many other restaurants and while they are ok none of them have even a patch on Hokaido.  The staff are all very friendly and funny and like to engage with their customers, unlike a lot of restaurants. They are VERY child friendly, and I often take my youngest sister who is 3 and always requests to go here.   They have so many delicious rolls, the top favourites of mine are the Muchi Muchi, the Red Mountain & the Tiger roll, but that said each one of their rolls are amazing and I've never not liked a roll.   The Chicken Katsu is also to die for along with their Dynamite, Tempura Shrimp & Veg, and their Teriyaki Salmon.  Yes it is pricy but you get what you pay for, quality produce, incredible dishes and outstanding presentation. It is also about 15 mins drive from the strip, but well worth the trip. A lot of my friends come from out of town and the first thing they always request...HOKAIDO  Believe me once you try Hokaido, you'll never go back to those all you can eat run of the mill sushi places.  This is one of those places that are an amazing finds, that never fail to impress."}
{"text":"Gave them another shot for lunch and my experience was much improved. First, the server was so friendly, she was the perfect host from seating to leaving. Just great!  Ordered the $14.95 lunch special which includes 6 pieces of nigiri, a basic roll of your choice (cali, cucumber, or spicy tuna) and a soup & salad, and then separately a small sake on the side not part of the lunch deal . The only bad part of the meal was sake, it had a little funk to it, like maybe it was really low end. Salad was the standard gingery-sweet & spicy dressing but refreshing and good.   What impressed me was the quality of their nigiri. Also, this was one of the better spicy tuna rolls I have had in a long time between the freshness of the fish and the taste of their mix. It was SPICY, like I like it- sometimes I find these rolls to be bland. Not here! Also, check out my photo of the nigiri- whoa, you can just see the glisten freshness. Definitely glad I gave it another try, will be back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Awesome service! JJ the chef is why we come back. He's amazing!sit at the sushi bar and enjoy your fresh fish and shots."}
{"text":"The sushi and nigiri was so darn fresh here and reasonably priced. Not to mention the friendly service from chef Su. Atmosphere was lively even diring lunch hour....Definitely satisfied my craving and will most certainly be going back."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. I went there with four of my girlfriends and we each ordered four rolls. She mixed all of our rolls up on different plates so we had to figure out which was ours, grab our food from friends' plates, & figure out what else was missing. I asked her to please put our food separate from each others to ease the confusion and she said she did it to minimize out wait time so we could all eat together. Then we were missing rolls and she kept forgetting our food. Toward the end of our meal, we had our missing food but one friend noted and informed our server that she didnt get her \"What The Hell\" roll. We had two orders of that, one for her and one for my other friend. She never got hers but our server insisted she remembered bringing it out to us. We only got ONE of them. We were supposed to have TWO. So she said she would remove it from the receipt, again saying she remembered giving it. She gave us back the new receipt and again asked if we were sure we didn't get it, and again we said no. She gave us the updated receipt and left.   Aside from that, there happy hour menu was limited & quite boring.  Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Service was horrible!!!! When greeted, the hostess & waitress were chatting then offered to sit us....then instead of our waitress offering us what to drink she went back to the hostess at front to finish their conversation......as I waited about 5-7 minutes for her attention and service...i finally decided to waive at her and told her we are ready to order...she finally took our order and didnt apologize....i was so disappointed....the food order took forever to come and she never once acknowledged if we need or if everything is ok with our order!!!! Never coming back again!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time trying this place. Now they do have happy hour specials which makes it a great place to go and get sushi at a decent price, the service her e is really good they are very prompt in helping you out and the food is pretty good, I  will be returning again."}
{"text":"I love the bubble glass,music and sever.I can come here everyday.Atmosphere are great.I alway order Dynamite,shrimp tempura roll and hibachi fried rice."}
{"text":"I like this place because of their happy hour and staff. The sushi isn't awesome, but it isn't bad. Their service is always great and they are very quick. I like their happy hour menu because they have a variety of things besides sushi. Plus, if you want a quick, cheap bite late night, this place never disappoints. They even have the option of half rolls on happy hour, so for the people that aren't committed, that is always an amazing option! This also gives you the chance to try variety of things, as well. They have appetizers, sides, sushi, drinks etc. all on happy hour, so there will always be something for someone."}
{"text":"Some friends and I on vacation in Las Vegas decided on a sushi lunch!  The first two places we tried were closed on Sunday afternoon, but Hokaido Sushi was open and amazing!  The fish was excellent, the presentation was excellent, and some of the selections were quite novel.  Five stars!"}
{"text":"Went here just at the end of Happy Hour.  The place looked clean with a dim decorated feel.  The service was okay, but should have been better with the fact that we were the only customers there.  The service & vibe from the staff could use some improvements. The food is what sold us.  The menu offers smaller size select rolls so you can use your money wisely to try a variety of rolls.  Unlike many other sushi restaurants, this place offers a select few of Nigiri sushi for Happy Hour prices as well.  The food is fresh & good quality with a good fish to rice ratio which is a huge pet peeve for this sushi addict.  We will be returning for more."}
{"text":"Love love love Hokkaido. They are right down the street from my house which is just an added bonus as I would drive across town to eat here.  We have eaten here quite a few times now and have loved everything I have tried.  Servers and chefs greet you when you come in and take great care of you and are super helpful with any questions or special requests."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.For some reason, I've had a hard time finding good sushi here in Vegas. I like their seafood fried rice. I expected it to be hot, and it wasn't so I was a bit put off at first, but MAN, it's tasty! I ordered the small lunch bento box which comes with rice, 4 piece Cali roll, miso and salad. For some reason, they gave me 2 Cali rolls' and no rice. I asked for the rice as I wanted it and they seemed a bit annoyed. I said it says on menu it comes with rice. But, to be honest, when it comes to \"asian\" places, they are never very accommodating. Oh well, the food is good. Service is eh. Nothing good, nothing really bad either. Prices are pretty decent too."}
{"text":"I've had Hokaido bookmarked since I saw Megan C.'s review a few months back. With all their 5 star reviews I was eager to try it but a little weary of the hype. Sure, it might be a little premature for me give this place such high marks after one visit and after only trying two rolls, but those 2 rolls were damn good.   - Kamikaze roll ($11.00) - eel tempura roll with spicy tuna and avocado. Absolutely loved it! - Rock 'n Roll ($12.50) - 5 kinds of  generously cut  fresh fish and crab wrapped in cucumber.  Their menu is filled with all the prerequisite creatively-named rolls that contemporary sushi joints have but from what I saw of other rolls being served they are beautifully presented and quite large.  The staff and sushi chefs were incredibly friendly and treated everyone like they were old friends. The atmosphere isn't as modern as the rolls they serve, but it's still a comfortable environment. It's kinda got a stereotypical japanese restaurant feel with the dark wood and traditional japanese decor.  This place is definitely worth a few more visits and might become my new favorite neighborhood sushi joint."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi at a good price. Sushi chefs are really friendly and good at what they do. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My favorite part is the happy hour from 2-5 & 9-close! The customer service is great! Food taste amazing! Highly recommend the screaming O & California Crunch roll! Soooo delicious! Definitely my new favorite sushi spot!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a baked sushi called heart something & it was not baked at all & it did not taste good... the waitress barley spoke English and Everytime we had a question she would just look at us with a blank stare and ask the chef to answer..even though my first experience was bad,  by looking at the reviews this place seems good so I will give it another try one of these days..."}
{"text":"First couple times it was great..great service...last time not so much.  Teriyaki chicken was fatty ...tempura was not light..kind of greasy.  Disappointing as we thought we'd found our place for this type of food.  Also the town center location runs a coupon and this location won't accept it. :("}
{"text":"the other night I went to dine in at my local sushi spot before close, upon leaving I accidentally left my keys and wallet. By  the time I had realized I had left my belongings, the restaurant had already closed. So the next morning I went to retrieve my belongings, to find that my money had been removed from my wallet ($200). When I left the establishment that night there was not a single soul in sight. I'm %100 sure that the staff had something to do with this. When I contacted the owner to make them aware of the situation & to ask that they review the cameras.. not just for my satisfaction but to make them aware what kind of employees they have working for them.. he proceeded to raise his voice & argue with me defensively.. stating \"nobody touched it\" The waitress said she chased me out of the restaurant to give me my wallet and that did not happen. I just wanna spread the word about this horrific event & customer service provided from such establishment.. The manager does not care and did not try to even assess the situation. this place is clearly not a reputable business & I don't believe anyone should ever have to experience this.."}
{"text":"Came here after a long day of shopping and a concert. Was ready for some good eats!   Showed up at around 10:30, and we were able to get their happy hour price which are really cheap. We got multiple rolls of everything and some strange dishes called \" lasagna sushi\", and \"monkey brain\".   Sushi was served fresh, and I didn't need any sauce, so that's a good indicator on flavor. They have HUGE bowls of Udon for very modest prices.   Decor was also very nice! It was a mini Japan once you walked in. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the city. Period. Karai Salad is amazing! Any chef specials are worth getting! Chef is knowledgeable about every fish."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I'm impressed. The other reviews are correct. Friendly, helpful, EAGER staff. I was checked on often. It's not busy, but theres a thursday crowd.Tasty dishes-I had the Screaming \"O\", which I am particular about (I like them juicy and tasty ;) ), and it didn't disappoint! I also had the Hamachi Usuzukuri which was reminiscent of a dish I like at Sen of Japan. A tasty vinegaresque hamachi sashimi dish. Sen of Japan's is, of course, more elegant, but this place gives you more meat! Where's the beef! :) And then I have unagi for \"dessert\", and I've never had anyone eff that up. Come! Come!!"}
{"text":"I really hate amending a review, especially when it means I have to take my rating down a notch or two.   This place was my \"little gem\" on the west side - a delightful little sushi bar with exceptional food.  The thing that made Hokaido Sushi so great was the sushi chef - Eddie, but he's gone now - and so is my love for this place.   The chefs who remain do a marvelous job and the quality of the fish has not diminished one bit, but the magic is gone and the place just isn't the same.  Now, please excuse me while I go over in the corner and have myself a little cry."}
{"text":"Sushi was fresh and very tasty rolls Great service and good atmosphere. Definitely recommended and this place will be on my rotations of places to return too"}
{"text":"Sushi doesn't get better then this!   This is the only sushi place we go to because every time we stray away to try new places I'm ALWAYS disappointed. This place has high quality sushi its always fresh and they have a wide variety of specialty rolls which is good for me because that's all I order. The service is top notch and the chefs are fast and friendly.   Some of my favorite rolls include:   What the hell roll Lasagna roll The bikini roll   If your looking for great sushi and good service this is your spot.   Warning they do not have ayce so the bill can get pretty high but like the saying goes you pay for what you get! Our bill is usually around 90 bucks which isn't bad at all it's worth every penny!"}
{"text":"The sushi pieces were enormous and delicious- very different combinations from what I have had in the past. My only slight complaint was the order was placed over the phone and when we arrived to pick it up in the recommended time, they hadn't started it. It was late in the evening though and I'm sure they were getting ready to close up but didn't skip on making the sushi!"}
{"text":"Came in for the first time, really enjoyed it. We will defnitely be coming here again. Service was great as well."}
{"text":"Good, fresh fish, but nothing special.  Definitely one of the better places I have been to in Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"Amazing. Best sushi I have had in town!!  They are amazing!! Some of the freshest fish I have eaten, and the chefs know what they are doing, and love their jobs.   Would recommend to anyone that wants some good food!!"}
{"text":"Oh wow. We stopped by this place after hiking at red rock. We live on the other side of town but it is so worth it! If you like interesting rolls with sauces try the Ultimate tuna, crazy horse, or 3Alarm fire. Bu we also had some sushi pieces. Wow so fresh and huge!"}
{"text":"This place was okay. If you want a quick casual sushi bar and it you happen to be hungry and nearby it will suffice.    I tried the Miso Soup which was standard.  Yakitori chicken was ok, nothing special.  The Japanese Lasagna is a creamy rich dish (Baked) Crab, Avo, cream cheese dish which piqed my curiosity.  It was a bit overpowering for my taste buds although I did see where they were trying to go with it.   Overall, average sushi bar with nothing that really set it apart from the rest."}
{"text":"Love this place. Every I come here is a great. New experience.  Some of the best sushi I Vegas. Awesome specials!!!! This is by far one of the best places for sushi in all the valley. The preparation and presentation is amazing. LOVE IT"}
{"text":"Always empty but always delicious. I'm not sure if i'm missing their peak hours but i'm not complaining. Sushi chef is always knowledgeable and makes rolls outside of the box."}
{"text":"Great sushi at a great price! We visit at least once a week! The salmon sushi is delicious :)"}
{"text":"This Is My All Time Favorite Sushi Bar In Las Vegas Hands Down. I Come Here About 3x A Week, The Sushi Is Always Excellent, The Employees Are Always Nice And Rush To My Needs. It's Always Laid Back And Never Too Busy. Rocky And Su Are My Favorite Sushi Makers And They Are The  Nicest Gentlemen You Will Ever Meet"}
{"text":"Service was terrible! The guy went to get a refill and never came back.. Had to ask someone else 10 minutes later. Good took forever and did not come out as ordered. The male waiter was clueless, forgetful, did not know the menu at all.  The food was delicious, but the garlic edamame was soooo spicy (which we weren't informed of it)."}
{"text":"This has become my new regular spot. Fresh fish and awesome sushi chefs.   Short staffed so can take a while when busy but worth it"}
{"text":"Coming to this place for many years now and I've seen changes come more and more recently. And the changes are not good especially in the service provided very slow"}
{"text":"If I could give more stars I would. Incredibly kind and personable staff with a home away from home coziness/feel to the atmosphere AND to top it off: ridiculously consistently cooked food that tastes fresh but is packed with flavor each.and.EVERY.damn.time. :O   Definitely go in during their happy hour for your first visit to take advantage of some of their mainstay dishes for a decent price. Some standout dishes (and the usuals for me) are their: -Salmon Skin Salad -Salmon Miso Kama -Philly Crunch Roll with extra Eel sauce  AND  -their \"Jennifer Roll\" (a special that you can spot off menu on top of the sushi bar)  This establishment has literally made me reevaluate eating at my typical AYCE restaurant go tos. Nothing even comes close to the quality and the pricing elsewhere."}
{"text":"Really thought that Hokaido would be a thumbs up after reading some great reviews on Yelp...so not sure what happened here!!!! Vegas has high standards for food, so Hokaido has disappointed!!!!  We had an average meal -- the lunch specials were a great price, but took a VERY long time to be served and were nothing really exciting.  The \"crazy spicy chicken\" tasted like kimchee-drenched onions with some chicken added as an afterthought (not too good!). The chicken katsu was pretty good, but how hard is it to bread chicken in panko and fry it...  If you're looking for great food and good service, I would say that Hokaido is a miss.."}
{"text":"Hidden gem of some really good sushi in Vegas.  I was upset beacuse I thought I would never find a sushi place comparable to the Bay Area since I moved to Vegas.  But I finally found one that comes close!  I'm so happy and excited about it!  Must haves: - Garlic Edamame...deep fried and garlicky! - Ebi Crunch...my favorite! - Something Wrong # 69..ain't nothing wrong! haha! - Vegas...no rice but still good  I like how the sushi that does have rice, doesn't really have that much rice!  Sushi is very flavorful, and different!  Hokaido is definitely creative in their sushi creations.  I've also had the agedashi tofu, gyoza, and tempura ice cream.  Appetizers were good, but the ice cream was freezer burned on the inside of the fried shell BOO!  Also, do not order the double hamachi; it totally takes away from the Hamachi and it's way too saucy.  Just get the regular Nigiri Hamachi if you're craving it.  Freshness!  But I still give this place 5 stars!  Go now!  Fort Apache hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Me encanto , super recomendable, el resto muy prolijo y el servicio muy agradable... Lo mejor fue que estaba abierto en Navidad !!  Vamos a volver de seguro"}
{"text":"Came here for mother's day with the family. Everything was delicious,  the food was fresh and fast. The service was great and the prices were unbeatable."}
{"text":"I have been to coming here a lot of time but not any more. I couldn't get any food ... Korean chef wanna go home and he don't wanna make any. We need to leave. They don't serve you 1 hour before they close ."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Hokaido and I heard the food was amazing. We arrived around 1300 and we were seated pretty quick. The food was great and they have this awesome lunch special from 1100-1500 with many choices. I got the salmon teriyaki bento box. It came with rice, miso soup, a salad, 4 California rolls, and the salmon teriyaki.   Food was great but the main issue was the service. The waitress was very sweet, but we literally were waiting for 15 minutes just to get water. I told her our drinks with our food order together so we could just get it at once. It wasn't that busy so I was surprised why it was taking so long. On top of that there were 7 dirty tables around us. They should have the cook help the poor girl out. She was literally sprinting across the restaurant. They need more staff to keep up with flow of people coming into the restaurant. Good food but it's just sad that we had to wait so long to get our order in."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for work and my co worker told me about Hokaido sushi and i'm sure he did. I thought the sushi overall was very tasty. I especially enjoyed the JJ special roll and the baked mussels. I took off a star due to the service, the waitress forgot to bring us menus and to place our order. I think she may have been new. I definitely would come back though."}
{"text":"Love this place..  2nd time being here but this time i actually got a chance to try some of their sushi instead of their lunch special.  Presentation is beautiful and quality is superb.  This is one of those safe spot if you're looking to try a new sushi place, and uncomfortable leaving your \"go to\" sushi joint.  Hokaido will not disappoint.  No AYCE here."}
{"text":"Rarely do I show my face in a sushi joint that is not AYCE.  Feeling froggy, I decided to give Hokaido a go based on the Yelp! reviews.  Picked up a to-go order of Mexican Roll and 3 Alarm Fire Roll.  Both were excellent.  I agree with everyone who mentioned how beautiful the presentation is.  Even in a to-go box, they made it look really cool.  Didn't hurt that it also tasted really good."}
{"text":"We went tonight based on all the great reviews and they were right this place is Great! We loved the service and their sushi is fresh and taste absolutely amazing. This will definetly be one of our new sushi places."}
{"text":"My favorite Sushi spot in Vegas!  The fish freshness and quality is as good as anyone could hope for inland, and beats out a lot of old favorites in Cali.  The chefs are fun and talented, and the restaurant is always clean and inviting.  The focus here is where it ought to be: the sushi.  Red Bean Mochi FTW!"}
{"text":"Only have come here for their bento, not any rolls or nigiri, and they're delicious! There's a lot to choose from so that may be why the bento is a bit more expensive. However you find it more than reasonable after the taste. I took my little cousin here for lunch and she loved it more than most other Japanese places we've been to. Can't say anything about their sushi, but their bentos are great!"}
{"text":"Great fresh tasting fish! The tiger roll and the most key brains are delish!!! The Poki salad has really nice size pieces of tuna and great seaweed salad mixed in. Tonight I tried the Butter Nipple and it had a great taste especially with garlic sauce. Only down fall is they don't have an all you can eat option here at all."}
{"text":"I love eating here every time I visit Vegas! The food is fresh and delicious. My favorites include the Mexican, lobster, and Vegas rolls...but there's soo much to choose from."}
{"text":"Great sushi place for date nights. The staff was very friendly and attentive during our meal, always refilling our drinks and taking away empty plates in time. The prices are a bit on the expensive side but I wasn't disappointed with my meal. All in all, a great restaurant"}
{"text":"I love Hokaido Sushi. It's close by home so we definitely come here often if we need a quick sushi fix. I went here for lunch and they have some good lunch box options. I ordered the Beef Bulgogi which includes 4 pieces California Roll, Salad, Rice and Miso Soup. My aunt ordered the Chicken Teriyaki and she was impressed with it since there was not an overabundance of sauce. We also ordered salmon nigri, sweet shrimp, the Unaten Roll and the Grand Canyon roll. The sushi was delicious as always and its definitely a place to try. It's not an all you can eat place, but I think the sushi more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"YES! An amazing sushi joint right next to my place that tastes great and has even better prices. Check out the happy hour menu, it's off the chain. I went with my mom around 2:30 on a Thursday and my boyfriend later joined us. We had the whole place to ourselves, which was perfect.  5 dollar large Saporros to start, 2 dollar edamame... Then the rolls. Oh, the rolls. We got California rolls, spicy tuna, spicy salmon, shrimp tempura and an order of octopus sushi. Everything was absolutely delicious. I actually don't really like fish, because it's always too fishy tasting: aka old. Well, for the first time in my life I ate a little (or lot) of everything and enjoyed every single last bite. And our bill? Under 50 bucks. (Half was beer... Oops.) Thank you for the stellar service, wonderful food and great vibe. I will be back again. And again. And again."}
{"text":"We've been coming to Hokaido for a couple years now. We really like the place because 1. They are super friendly 2. You get more bang for your buck here; quality, presentation & service.  The staff, like most sushi restaurants, greet you right away, but they don't  look miserable doing it at this place lol. They remember us everytime we go there and the sushi chefs even take the time out to talk to us.   The food is average, in price but very quality sushi and the presentation is awesome! They use anything from flowers, radish, leaves but the thing that really impressed me the most was the radish that they carved into a butterfly! I have a photo but I can't find my cord for camera! I know, a big FAIL for me. lol  The restaurant itself is quite small, not really ideal if you have more than 6 people but it's a great place if you're looking to have some quality sushi!"}
{"text":"I love Hokaido.  A great neighbor restaurant!.  The service is always top notch!  I took my friend for a pre-concert dinner on Sunday.  We sat at the sushi bar and started off with Sapporos in frosty, ice cold mugs!  We ordered the Blue Fin Toro - melt in your mouth deliciousness.  We followed with I love my Ass, Hawaiian and Dark Horse - incredible sauces;  tasty fish - Awesome!"}
{"text":"Best presentation in town on sushi - kinda a hidden gem!  Sushi is awesome and doesn't get to crowded.  Didn't have one sushi I didn't like!"}
{"text":"Had the lobster roll, red mountain roll, and the Philadelphia roll. Pricey but everything tasted great! Would give 5 stars if they had ayce to save me a few bucks."}
{"text":"Excellent quality sushi. They are the real deal. When they served pickled wasabi on my sushi i just knew it was gonna be the real deal. Downfall.... There was o it one waitress during lunch rush. I will still go back. I highly recommend this place. And they have lunch box specials for $6.95... Now that's a deal."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I've only had sushi though so idk about the bento food. The only thing that makes me drop one star is the lack of knowledge that the servers have. Every time I asked a question about the menu like \"what sauce comes on this roll?\" She would have to go ask the sushi chef and it would take like 5 mins just to find out something simple. As a server, they should know better. But that's why I like to sit at the sushi bar bc they would be able to answer my questions. But overall, I really do love this place and I will continue coming back to eat."}
{"text":"Every single time I return to this restaurant, it is always consistent, and great. The service is excellent and they are always extremely friendly.   Last time my son and I came here we tried the Tempura Cheese Cake, which was a rich, delicious dessert. We, to say the least, devoured it.  Even if the food wasn't as good as it is, I would go in just for the love all the staff shares! Thank you for caring about your guests!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. Been a fan since 2008. The whole staff is great. I rather spend the extra dollars than all you can eat."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Hokkaido for a couple years now and it has the best sushi in town. Additionally the service is excellent and the waitress's are very kind. Their happy hour is also a great value."}
{"text":"This place has become one of my once a week spots for sushi!! It's the real deal with good fresh fish. I don't usually eat rolls, and it's hard to find sashimi and sushi with the right quality. These guys know what they are doing."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best sushi I've ever had still to this day, it's 5 mins from my house which is even better, I just wish they still had all you can eat. I don't know why they got rid of that in the first place. But awesome food !!"}
{"text":"Disappointing! I guess I had high hopes for this place after reading the reviews.   I had mushroom miso, It was flavorful but they used dried shitake mushrooms which I'm not a fan of. I love fresh shitake mushrooms though.   We ordered Tuna Poke, Hamachi Usuzukuri, Mango Salmon, Kiwi Salmon and Sexy Monkey.   I thought Tuna Poki, Hamachi and Sexy Monkey were pretty flavorful to me. As for Mango and Kiwi Salmon, both were bit different, mango didn't taste ripe to me. Kiwi had avocado that wasn't ripe either and crab stick in it and I end up having this crab wrapper in my mouth, hence minus a star.   Despite that they had friendly staff, I wouldn't go back again for the food as I've been there twice..."}
{"text":"Sushi was not bad. Wonderful service. Garlic edamame was delicious.  Thank you to Young for being so sweet and friendly even though we were a pain in the ass. She made me a custom spicy sauce and made no fuss when we had a disagreement on an order.  Thank you Young!"}
{"text":"This Sushi restaurant is absolutely my favorite!!! Quality of food is really good and Sushi chef and server gave us good recommendation!!  They have lots of variety of speciality rolls and we tried Dragon and Red Rock and other rolls I don't remember.. Sashimi salad is also must to eat!! They got so many appetizer and I definitely come back here over AYCE since they have fresh and tasty fish. Price of food is not bad at all!! I really recommend this restaurant. The Sushi Chef, Sue is so nice and kind. We will come back to see him."}
{"text":"Great food, and a decent happy hour menu.  We sat at the bar and rocky was our chef. He was awesome, he made us several amazing rolls and even gave us a complimentary yellow tail appetizer.  He also gave us a small desert as well on the house. We will definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot but if you are used to AYCE, this place might sting your wallet a bit.  The rolls are amazing and the fish quality is very good, but it's a only a notch or two better than Jjanga or Sushi Koma.  I would still recommend though, because they have an awesome Screaming Orgasm salad - you may want to ask for them to leave the furikake seasoning off of it, because it tasted weird to me.  Nigiri was just okay, and I would probably skip it next time.    Happy Hour menu is not as great of a deal as some other places.  Prices looks great until you realize it's for half rolls.  But it works out to be a $2-3 discount on a selection of $12-13 rolls."}
{"text":"The best sushi in Vegas. Superb Japanese authentic sushi in town. The food is really really good, it's to die for. The sushi and sashimi are top notch. Service was excellent, the hostess and waitresses are very friendly and accommodating. I would recommend Hokaido Sushi at Fort Apache for everyone."}
{"text":"We walked in early on Thursday evening and were immediately greeted.  We were getting sushi to go.   The sushi chef told me to step on up and he took our order.  It was delicious.  Very fresh, very flavorful.  We are not AYCE people, so we thought sushi amounts and prices were fine.  We live close and will definitely go back and sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Hokaido Sushi has one of the most creative and nicely garnished sushi I've seen.  Our group didn't order any nigri (except for Uni) or sashimi, so I really couldn't gauge the true freshness of the fish. Nothing had the bad fishy taste, so I'll give them the okay in that department.  * Gyoza - It was good, but Ichiza's gyoza is much better. The waitress said it was pan fried, but I have my doubts based on the crispiness of the skin. The crispiness took away some of the flavors away from the gyoza.  * Yellowtail Appetizer - I believe this was the yellowtail with some jalepeno, garlic, and onions. Refreshing and clean tasting.  * Uni - fresh and creamy with a nice golden yellow color. delicious.  * Surf & Turf - This has a nice piece of steak on top of the sushi. Taste wise it works very well. You may not like the texture since the steak on top isn't as soft as eating a fish.  * House Special Spicy Hokaido - This thing was fairly hot, killing my taste buds. Good thing it was at the end of the meal. Maybe a less spicy roll with less chili paste and jalape√±o wouldn't kill the taste of it.   * Bikini, Red Rock, Something Wrong #69 - All of these were good. No complaints.  Service could have been better. We were missing 2 placemats in our group of 4. She forgot one of our orders, which is hard to believe considering we didn't order that much. She wasn't very attentive even when we were the only group in the sushi bar. She was not filling up our drinks in a timely manner or wasn't there when we needed something. She didn't seem to have any knowledge of the house special rolls, having to rely on the sushi chefs. While she was very kind and friendly, she seems very inexperienced. This should be an easy fix for the business if they're reading this.  This place uses a lot of garnish, even more garnish than the sushi and has a lot of creative rolls that are actually executed right. Every sushi plate that came out truly looks like an artwork. If you're with someone who likes their sushi visually pleasing or some more creative rolls, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This is our go-to sushi place. We love it in here--it's small, it's never loud, and the sushi is always fresh and delicious. The service is good--we've been here dozens of times, and we've never had a bad experience. The complimentary cucumber salad at the beginning of the meal is wonderful!  We never do the 'happy hour' menu--let's get real, it's not really a happy hour as it's half the roll for half the price. We just order from the regular menu and stay happy :)"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more stars for how much you could tell they were trying to please customers as much as they could, but I would rather leave an honest review.   Very friendly and attentive staff, the only downfall is that if you're planning to save money by ordering off the happy hour menu, you might as well just order all you can eat at your local sushi spot instead. Ended up paying almost $60 in happy hour items for two (and we are not very big eaters!) -- when you can probably just get more bang for your buck, with more variety, elsewhere. I would try this place again maybe sometime in the future, just not raving to go again."}
{"text":"food is always delicious. the hibachi fried rice is my go to order and my favorite thing to get. the ramen broth is also very flavorful and not a lot of fat. most of the time there is only one waitress, so the service is slow since it tends to be busy."}
{"text":"My fave sushi place! Seafood here is really fresh. I love the variety in the menu. Happy Hour has an amazing selection and is very affordable. My favorite is their Homemade Tamago Nigiri and the Salmon Skin Handroll.  The owner is a great guy. Very friendly and down to earth. We love coming here any time of day."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places in Las Vegas. From great foods, to great happy hour prices, cold beer, and Angela. Honestly for me, her service is what brought me back the second time, and the 10th, and 20th. Very friendly and on top of everything. It never seems to be full, but I wouldn't want it any other way. Only thing missing is AYCE, but with their happy hour, you won't be going home with empty pockets, just a full belly."}
{"text":"Omg this restaurant was nothing better than AYCE restaurants. A la carte sushi restaurants should have better quality of fish but not at all... Their price was A la carte but quality was ayce. I just tried sushi ne*o in China town and their nigiris were so much better. And a waitress was so rude, no eye contact! she just took our order and turned away without letting us finished. I could tell that we were irritating her so bad because we wanted to order more food. Horribly trained staff because they gave us happy hour menu and when we were ready to order that rude waitress just snatched the happy hour menu and said they're not available. F*** this place I will never return. I will spread my bad experience to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Really good sushi here folks.  The fish tasted good and the chef's creations were nice and yummy.  I'll be moving around this area in the next few months and I am happy there is a sushi bar so close, you will see more of me Hoaido."}
{"text":"Unclean, sloppy, and prepare for a belly ache if you get their \"fresh\" oysters.  The chef owner has a lot of personality and this used to be a locals hot spot before the wave of AYCE sushi hit town.  However, for the sake of your precious office sick days and your sensitive organs, I recommend going for the many other AYCE in town with better hygiene and quality of fresh seafood."}
{"text":"I had to reduce my previous 5 star rating. Today, the fiod sucked. This never hsppened in the last 2 plus years i've been going here. Either the owners or the cook changed. There is no other explanation. If there is a good explanation, i'll listen..."}
{"text":"YUM! Probably the best rolls I've ever had thus far. The variety here is intense! There were so many to choose from, but the 3 we chose were all very delicious.  We had the Unaten roll which included shrimp tempura, avocado, eel etc. Vegas roll that was deep fried and included the perfect amount of cream cheese, just a tad! and the Sweetheart Roll which our sushi chef recommended, it's \"baked\" meaning they torch it to \"bake\" the top salmon, it also included spicy crab, shrimp tempura, and roe. It was full of flavor and very delicious  Although the quality of the food was fantastic, the minor problems here are: -The drive is definitely quite away from the strip, about 8 miles? We were in the mood for some good sushi so yelped led the way. -each specialty roll was about $12-$13, 3 of which added up to $40 pre-tip altogether for two -- a little on the steep side these days  Service was really friendly and fun, and there wasn't a wait at all! They're open pretty late too on a Sunday.. til 11pm"}
{"text":"We decided to try Hokaido Sushi because we have wanted to kinda get out of the rut of always going to the same place because there is \"this ONE roll I like that I haven't seen elsewhere\". Hokaido had a given perk in its favor when it came down to where we were going to experiment next - It isn't far from home, up on Fort Apache. We saw the excellent reviews second so it was a go. I am a roll fan (so I guess I would be considered not to be an aficionado when it comes to sushi) but we enjoyed the selection of rolls and the flexibility we were allowed in substituting here and there with contents and toppers for the rolls (spicy crab in lieu of Spicy Tuna; Rainbow rolls with Jalapenos rolled on the inside, etc) We found several rolls to our liking and were very pleased with the presentation, the time it took to be served, the kindness of our waitress (who was willing to help my newbie brother out with a chopsticks cheater tool :-)) We will definitely be going back because there is just so much more on the menu we would like to try. We had a really hard time making our minds up for this round."}
{"text":"Hokaido simply kicks ass for sushi. We drove a darn good distance from the strip to try this place and we did not come away disappointed. This has to be my favorite sushi place in Vegas. Just super fresh fish, a sushi chef that was unafraid to recommend some simply great fish and a casual, chill atmosphere.   What made Hokaido stand out was the Aji and Toro we had. Just super fresh and flavorful cuts of fish, meticulously prepared, and sushi rice was spot-on. We consulted the sushi chef several times and he had some excellent recommendations. My only regret was that they were out of Kohada when I was there. Oh well. Even more reason to go back!"}
{"text":"I guess if you are not stuck on the idea that your sushi rolls should contain raw fish, then this place is good.  All the \"special rolls\" that are priced anywhere from $9.95 to $15.00 contain either crab meat or shrim tempura, both of those are extremely cheap and not very tasty ingredients.  I understand thats how sushi bar makes the money, but if you price a roll at $14.95, at least put raw fish on the inside and on the outside.  Ultimate tuna roll is the only roll with raw tuna on the inside and the outside.  Considering that I was there on a Monday, my rolls and nigiri should not have had a slight fishy smell, yet they did........so fish was not super fresh.  Presentation is nice though, but if the food are not tasty, who cares.......I suppose if you dont care what you get in your rolls then this place is for you.  I would rather drive for 25 minutes to go to I Love Sushi on Eastern Ave"}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say.  Some of the BEST sushi I've had in a very long time.  I was thoroughly impressed by the quality.  Everything I ordered was amazing"}
{"text":"Great sushi bar in this part of town. Had a sashimi platter and a sushi combo that was shared by 3 people and it was more than enough food.  Not a fan of their Yum Yum scallop roll but the dragon roll was presented beautifully and tasted equally good.  Service was very friendly each time I've gone there. I try to go here at least once or twice a week."}
{"text":"Love, love this spot!  We've been here over 5 times within the last couple of monthly.  We love the service here.  Everyone is super friendly and attentive.  The food is amazing.  Every dish we order was fresh and the right amount of sauce blend.  Our favorites are the Screaming \"O\", Dark Horse, and the cucumber wrap roll."}
{"text":"This place is wayyyy bomb. Superior to JJANGA in every way, they do NOT HAVE AYCE, cuz quality. Alley was our server, super nice & attentive. Will be back boiiiiii"}
{"text":"Really good place for sushi . I ordered take away over the phone 30 min later I arrived to the place but my order wasn't ready  So I waited 10 More min , I was a little bit upset but once I got home and start eating I realize that it was  worth it :) . All fresh and great flavors. will definitely will eat there again"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite sushi restaurant. The specials were amazing. Rocky gave us great recommendations. Loved the king salmon nagiri sushi!"}
{"text":"I've only been here twice now and I think it's good but nothing too great.. And to be quite honest I think the portions and cuts are little on the smaller side.. They have a huge specialty roll menu starting at around $9..  They also have lunch special bento boxes which is a plus.. We ordered salmon & chicken Katsu but they accidentally gave us beef instead of salmon.. They apologized and corrected the mistake.. Oh well, free teriyaki beef!... Too bad it was a bit on the chewy side..   Their spicy tuna is spicer than other places so be careful!!!  Another thing I've noticed about this place is that the food takes a long time to come out...  I'll probably be back again since its close to my house.. But like I said.. It was nothing too special for me..  On the plus side: free green tea ;)))"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night with 2 of my friends. About 10 minutes after we ordered my friend received her Bento Box, which was awesome. 20 minutes went by and my and I have yet to receive our order of sushi.   Now for a Friday night I can understand why it would take a while to receive our order, but there was only 2 other groups eating there. A third group came in and they received their order quickly after they ordered yet it was 30 minutes for us to receive our sushi roles.   Now I understand why it was empty on a Friday night. Highly dissatisfied and will not be recommending this place to my friends or will I be eating here again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi joint around. My wife and I try to make it here as much as we can. We always come here during happy hour. The happy hour menu has a lot of selections and the prices are very good too. My wife and I can get super full and not have it hurt my wallet. I would recommend this place to anyone. This place proves that you don't need to go and spend hundreds of dollars to eat good sushi.   I wish they offered an all you can eat.  Overall I am very satisfied with this place, and I am positive that we will continue eating here for as long as we live in Vegas.   If you are just visiting Vegas, it is worth the trip to come to this place. Great food, great staff, and a clean and quiet location."}
{"text":"Driving by stopped in just for some take out, first time there. As I waited for my order I was offered water and edamame. Delicious food, prompt, excellent service .  Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"The BF and I and some friends went for dinner during their late night happy hour (starts at 10pm- 2am).   Rolls were served 4 pieces to a order.   We got salmon skin roll ($2.75) - decent,  but standard. I like the beet butterfly they did as garnish - pretty.   Hawaiian roll (around $5.25) - pretty decent again, but standard. It has spicy tuna, wrapped in various fish with ponzu.   It didnt seem happy hour was much of a deal generally, there were a few items on major discount. It can make for good variety since its half rolls but once you add up 2x orders its close to the normal roll price. Theres no happy hour menu or mention of it on their site, but its a select menu of alcohol, rolls, and some appetizers on special. The sake bombs were a good deal though, I believe $3.  At this point we decide going with a dinner bento is probably best than going all happy hour.    We shared a 3 item combo -  *Albacore sashimi (5pc) - it was pretty fresh actually,  no complaints there. *Tonkatsu - nicely crisp, it was a bit dry.  *Spicy chicken - was Korean style with onions, zucchini, and chicken in a spicy sauce. It wasn't too spicy though but it was flavorful.    Miso soup and salad that comes with is again, decent but standard fare.   Service was fairly decent.   Its not bad but its not great. I would say it was all pretty average Americanized Japanese.  I think if thats what you were craving you can probably find a good meal here. I guess with the reviews I was expecting something more."}
{"text":"Although a bit pricey, the sushi here is delicious and the presentation is the nicest I've ever seen!  Excellent quality and fresh fish!  I got the bulgogi-don when I was there and it was so good.  Rice covered in sauce, Korean style bulgogi, and veggies.  Very homey and delicious.   I also ordered a California roll just to try.  It came out on a beautiful platter with orchids.  What?  Just for a California roll?  Nice!  My husband got one of the bento boxes.  The beef teriyaki isn't awesome, just OK... but the sushi that came with it was so good!    All in all, if I want to stuff my face with sushi, I might go to a cheaper place like Kobe (another one of our frequented spots)... but if I'm looking for a nice relaxing dinner with quality sushi, I'll come back here!"}
{"text":"Wow. I mean, wow. Skilled, artful presentation and fresh ingredients. Veg tempura roll w/brown rice was absolutely incredible - so many other sushi places produce tempura rolls that fall apart, but mine stayed deliciously intact. The hibachi rice is something I'm dedicated to trying to replicate at home. My husband had the kamikaze roll and said he was confident he'd picked the best roll on the menu.   Service was attentive and friendly, we can't wait to go back! Our new favorite place in Vegas and worth the quick drive off the strip!"}
{"text":"I love this place because it is peaceful.The server is great.Fried rice is good taste.Also the happy hour is 9pm-closed."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!  Every sushi dish that we had was thoroughly enjoyed. The service is terrible!  But that can be overlooked because every dish is delicious"}
{"text":"The great thing about this place is the rolls!! There are so many different varieties. Also they have great oysters on a Friday night"}
{"text":"Not as we thoughts.  Food is very different than on the photos.  Service is not the best.  She threw dishes to the table, no smile,  etc.  Vegetable tempura sushi was pasty."}
{"text":"Every time my wife and I go here, it is fantastic. She always gets the what the hell roll and others, and I usually get the ebon crunch. It is always fresh, service is great, I can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"Cute neighborhood sushi spot.  Nothing too fancy, pretty down to earth.    Went there for the happy hour, the price was really good and with plenty of selections.  However I think the sushi bar is doing a better job than the hot kitchen.  Hot dishes were so so and honestly kinda overcooked.    We had spider roll, that was yummy!  Shrimp/ veg tempura and agedashi tofu were good.  And that's pretty much it.  The fried gyoza was greasy & rubbery.  Salmon miso kama was too well done.  Yakitori was blended.    We definitely will go back because the servers were awesome.  Just avoid ordering hot dishes.  lol"}
{"text":"Hokaido has been our neighborhood sushi spot for a couple of years now and we have a pleasant experience every time we go. The staff and sushi chefs are always welcoming...they even know us and our kids by name! The fish is always fresh and the service is timely. We love going to Hokaido. And we HIGHLY recommend you give them a try!"}
{"text":"I am a sushi snob. Bring a California girl I couldn't imagine good sushi in the desert. I was so wrong! The sushi was some of the most delicious ice ever eaten. The presentation was wonderful, portions filling, and the taste was FRESH! It took some time waiting for the sushi to arrive but they gave us complementary cucumber and crab salad and some edamame, good things take some time to prepare anyway.  I will make it a point to eat here when visiting family again. I'm getting hungry just thinking of it."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and while I use to come back because the sushi was good, the service has always left me disappointed. Today was probably the last time I will go here. We came around 915pm, and while there was about 5 other tables already there, at about 935, we decided to leave.  No one got our drink order, asked us if we wanted to order or anything. Service has always been slow but this was the final straw."}
{"text":"Can't review sushi, as we did not eat here.   Went to Hokaido for date night with my wife, we walked in to restaurant, two sushi chefs at bar were leaning on prep area with elbows playing games on their phones. After they noticed we were watching them, they both dropped to the floor to continue to play their games. We took that as a sign, paid for our drink and quickly left. I guess our first clue should have been that we were one of two tables at dinner time.   Not at all what I would expect walking into a sushi restaurant, went to Sushi Fever on Sahara, sat in a packed house and had a great dinner.  Never going back to Hokaido."}
{"text":"It's been years since I ate here last, mostly because of the location but nonetheless I was on this side of town and decided to stop by. I was quickly greeted and asked for a table. There were only 2 other tables of people dining which made for a quick turn around on my sushi order. The salmon nigiri melted in my mouth it was so fresh and sweet. The ikura was small but tasty and the roll I ordered was executed perfectly. The roll was called the \"I love my ass\" roll. With chopped soft shell crab inside and yellowtail to top, it came with a sweet yet tart mustard sauce. The waitress was attentive and kept my drink refilled. I'll agree that for a non-ayce sushi place, the prices are a bit high. Uni was $12 or $14.50 for a premium version. My bill was $28 after a 20% tip. I noticed the happy hour menu which seems very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We've been to Hokaido on 2 different occasions. The sushi chefs and the waitresses have all been very friendly and funny with our 1 year old, very kid friendly.  Our sushi and sashimi have both been very good. Fresh, good quality and a good sized portion. I think they're the best sushi option in the SW part of town and would recommend you giving them a try.  As a side note I called asking if they had a highchair for children and they confirmed that they did. When we arrived at the restaurant 10 minutes later they had our table waiting with the highchair already in place. That's good service!"}
{"text":"A bit pricy for the small portions. Food came out slow, although restaurant was almost empty. The two waitress kept coming by our table about a dozen times after we had ordered, yet no food. And the quality of the food was just average at best.  The sushi and rice tasted a bit firm. We were not quite done with one of our rolls when the waitress insisted to take the plate away. I said we're still working on that last piece, and she suggested we can move that roll over to the other plate. WTH??  Menus were hard to read and we felt rushed to order and to finish, even though the restaurant was pretty much empty.  Will not be returning, there are better choices out there in the LV area."}
{"text":"Just randomly stopped here for lunch and was so pleasantly surprised. Great prices especially for lunch. Very fresh sushi and well preprepared. If I lived in this neighborhood I'd eat here twice a week."}
{"text":"I'm a fan! The staff is really friendly & answer any questions you might have. The ambiance is nice. Dimly lit with fishies hanging with some net from the ceiling. Paper lanterns. The fish was REALLY fresh. I like the idea of them not having AYCE. Most places that have AYCE really lack the freshness in their fish. Ordered the Hawaiian Roll, Caterpillar Roll, Dragon Roll & the Lobster Roll. I LOVED the Hawaiian Roll & the Lobster Roll! You could really taste the freshness of the tuna in the Hawaiian, & the Lobster had this great sauce on top! Very friendly staff & great food! Will definitely be returning customers."}
{"text":"HOLY SASHIMI BATMAN!!!  The best sushi place Vegas! I eat sushi at least once a week and this is probably the best in town. I have eaten at numerous local sushi places throughout Vegas and some of the upper scale places on the strip and this place ranks high among the top! if not THEE BEST! LIKE A PARTY IN MY MOUTH! From the moment you walk in the staff greet you with a sincere and warm welcome. Ya know,  when they yell something that you have no idea what it means, but it sounds good?  They go out of there way to make you feel at home. The sushi bar is a great spot to sit and watch Sushi Chef Eric. It is a pleasure to watch him work his magic and make some of the most beautiful and delicious rolls. Every dish is a masterpice with intricate garnishes full of art, all hand carved and made to order. He spends his time laying every roll down perfectly to ensure that the presentation is just as visually appealing as it tastes. Gyoza is a great appetizer to order, make sure to get it deep fried for extra crunchiness. The sweet heart roll brings all the great elements together of hot and cold, sweet and salty, and soft and crunchy. The rice is perfectly cooked and holds the roll together, it is topped with fresh salmon broiled with a flame thrower right before it is served.   I've read some of the reviews on this place and yes it is a little on the higher price point, BUT C'MON!! If you are a true sushi fanatic, you know you pay for freshness!! You can't even get ALL YOU CAN EAT here. Ya know why!? BECAUSE ITS QUALITY!!   If you see me at the sushi bar, buy me a drink. Preferably a sake bomb."}
{"text":"Have ordered from here quite a few times and never had a problem until tonight . I placed an order for 2 orders of California Rolls at 10:17 . The lady on the phone told me 20-25 min . This is much longer then usual but no big deal . Got to the restaurant , Paid , tipped , then was told 10 more minutes . I went and sat with my husband in the car, waited the 10 minutes then went back in . I waited 3-4 minutes and no one came up to the front so I went back and sat in car for a few more minutes. When I went back in it had been 35 minutes since I placed this very small order . The lady tells me it's going to be another 10 minutes . At this point I'm frustrated because there were people that had come into the restaurant after I got there to dine in that were being served sushi but I couldn't get my order ?!? I told the lady I would just take a refund . She didn't know how to give a refund so she had to call someone on the phone to figure it out. It took 10 minutes just to get the refund and obviously the California rolls still weren't ready . This was ridiculous . If you can't fulfill an order, you could tell me on the phone instead of wasting my time , gas , and sanity ! NEVER AGAIN ! Oh, and don't tip BEFORE you get your order like I did . It cost me a couple bux in the end to be treated like a second class citizen because I wasn't dining in I suppose . Thanks for the 50 minute waste of my time ."}
{"text":"As a picky sushi eater - I'm always reluctant to try new places, but after reading the reviews we had to check this place out. From the outside it doesn't look like much. It's in a strip mall and if you're not looking you'd pass right by. When we drove up I thought I'd be let down.  When we walked in I was under impressed by the decor (which is why I give it 4 stars, atmosphere means a lot to me). But we were instantly greeted by the sushi chefs with some sort of call out, which was fun and welcoming. We were instantly seated and although the place was slow (only one other couple there) it was clean and pleasant.  After we ordered we were brought a really tasty cucumber salad. It was so good we asked for seconds, and got it no problem, with no extra charge. Our waitress was sweet and very patient. We took a long time to figure out what we wanted, and we ordered twice because we wanted more.  The menu is entertaining, with names like 'I love my ass'. We ordered that along with  'something's wrong with 69', \"monkey brains' and 'slippery nipple' (I think these were the names). We added some tuna and salmon sashimi and all in all we trilled with our choices! The '69' and the 'nipple' were amazing!!  This is now one of our new favorite places, the pricing was reasonable and the food was amazing. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been to Hokaido twice for there late night happy hour that goes from 9 pm to close and I loved it! At that hour it's not too packed and the service is great everyone is very friendly and helpful. With the happy hour you get bogo sake!! Can't beat that! They have a delicious lasagna roll, usually I can't handle the richness of a lasagna roll but Hokaidos is on point! Pretty much everything I've tried there I've enjoyed. My friend also tells me that they serve fish heads, I don't think there on the menu and I've never tried them but she says they're delicious. Just in case your feeling adventurous."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Hokaido Sushi by a friend earlier this year, and it immediately became my go-to sushi place.  While some of the rolls I've tried haven't been to my personal taste, they've always been very high quality.  My husband doesn't eat sushi, so he orders other things off the menu and has enjoyed the food every time.  I have two kids, one preschool aged and one elementary school aged, and the staff makes them feel very welcomed.  It's always wonderful to find a restaurant where my kids are thrilled to go."}
{"text":"Sam is awesome.  Great prices and friendly staff!  Try the hot sake...yum!  Our sone love the lunch box."}
{"text":"Katsu chicken - delicious. Sushi - Quality of fish solid, but not outstanding. Beer - well priced. Go!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Nothing is not good here! My first sashimi I ate here it's so good melts in your mouth. Their hot green tea is one of a kind!"}
{"text":"After giving this place a bad review a few years ago, me and my wife came back to try it out since its close to the house. And to our surprise their food gotten better and now they have ramen bowls which I crave for! I'll be coming back to this place again,"}
{"text":"Awesome Awesome place.  The ambiance is awesome, the staff is so friendly.  We go about once a week, because that is the only place we will go now :)  The sushi is amazing, have the specials the muchi muchi is the best!   They even cut up avocado and give us rice for my toddler to keep her entertained :) I would highly suggest this to anyone looking for a great sushi place."}
{"text":"If you like sushi - this is a must GO place. You should ask for the specials because the head chef gets top of the shelf sushi from all over the world. Simply amazing food, service and great atmosphere"}
{"text":"The sushi itself was pretty decent - nothing too extravagant.   I went here with 4 girlfriends for happy hour which the pricing was great, but the number of rolls was disappointing. The main reason why I rated this place a 2 is the service.  We asked if the rolls could be given together based on who ordered what. The server stated she was giving them to us on which ones came out first to avoid having us wait for our food, but I mean.. if we requested them to be served that way why not cater to your customers request? In any case, we ended up having to fish around other dishes to put our own orders together.  As we were paying, the same server was arguing with one of my girlfriends about an order being served, but my friend did not receive the order.  Overall.. The sushi was average. The service - well, I've experienced better."}
{"text":"Was there for lunch super fresh fish,my server was very nice and attentive.i order a chef sashimi and chef Sam put a very delicious and fresh fish on my plate , nice little place a little too far from my house but definitely I will be back again.thanks chef Sam"}
{"text":"Me and my three frienda found this, leaving LV after our spring break weekend. The sushi was rather cheap, and tasted fantastic! Two of us wefe vegetarian, the owner madr several tasty rolls for us.  We also got complementary japanese ice creams when we were done eating, so tasty!  I'm not a sushi expert, but I love decent sushi amd this place was a great restaurant to end our break!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend used to live near Hokaido, so when I mentioned I was craving sushi one evening but wanted a casual dinner.... he said he knew just the place and brought me to his go to sushi place.  I really enjoyed Hokaido. It is a great neighborhood restaurant. When we arrived it was a lil before the dinner rush, so we were immediately seated at the bar.  We ordered large Sapporos to start the dinner off and they were severed in frosty ice cold mugs! We were then served a delicious cucumber salad while we made our sushi choices.  My boyfriend prefers sashimi and I prefer rolls, so he ordered the salmon and fatty tuna (which he said we delicious), and I ordered The Sweetheart Roll and The Dark Horse roll.  Everything was delicious! I would definitely recommend these  two rolls- I will be ordering them again!  The location is small, it wasn't loud, great atmosphere, and the sushi was fresh and delicious. The service was great, our waitress was very attentive and the chefs we so personable and fun, great casual conversation. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"For a local sushi bar that is not trying too hard, they do an amazing job with absolutely amazing quality fish and a great staff. If you're looking for the fanciest new fusion cuisine, you're not going to find it here, but you will find the best quality sushi in Las Vegas and some really innovative dishes from a staff that loves their food.  All the sushi chefs are amazing, to be honest, but sit with JJ who has his own local following of Sushi Lovers who think he's the best sushi chef in Vegas. He's pretty good and deserve almost of his own restaurant on the Strip."}
{"text":"Friendly staffs,Great food and awesome atmosphere!They are offering Happy hour after 9 pm till close."}
{"text":"I think I have found a new sushi spot and it's conveniently down the street from my house! Seriously some of the best rolls I have ever had. I recommend getting the Dark Horse and the Buttery Nipple roll! If you like baked rolls, Sweetheart was delicious. I ordered to go so I'm rating solely on the sushi not the service of the place."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick business lunch. Small mall location, but was nice inside. Ordered spicy tuna with tuna topped rolls and a round of nigiri. Everything was very good! A bit on the pricey side compared to others, but not bad for the quantity and taste. Happy Hour prices look very good. My customer is from Hawaii and didn't like salmon, never have seen a Hawaiian turn down fish. i talked him into trying the nigiri..He liked it!  Menu looked awesome. Will go back and hit it hard one of these nights.."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Love Su and Rocky, the best chefs ever."}
{"text":"Awesome spot! Sam and Rocky are the best! They always accommodate and exceed our expectations. Service is always good!"}
{"text":"If sushi was kung-fu, their kung-fu is very strong.  Hokaido is what every sushi place should be about, really great sushi!  This isn't AYCE, but quality sushi that is worth the price you pay. They have the usual sushi rolls you expect and all their sexually suggestive names but the cheeky roll names aside they take great pride in their fish and it shows with every delectable bite from the rice they use to the quality of the seaweed paper.  Oddly, I'm a huge fan of the Mango Salmon roll which is odd since  I don't really like Mango.  These Sushi Wizards have found a way to package what was once a shunned fruit into something I order regularly.  That's talent!  Friendly service although at times can be slowed down when really busy, I'm very pleased with this establishment and count myself as a regular."}
{"text":"I love coming here. We come here almost everyday! The service is great and the food is consistently excellent. I love the quality of seafood. Always fresh and tastes delicious. The owner is very hands on and is great with customers. I highly recommend this place especially for Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"No All-U-Can-Eat, No Me-Come-Back.  Came for lunch and paid $17 for the sushi/sashimi combo.  Small miso soup, 6 pieces of sashimi & 4 standard pieces of sushi.  Aside from the very nice waitress, not impressed & still hungry.  Might as well go elsewhere for a $20 all-u-can-eat sushi lunch."}
