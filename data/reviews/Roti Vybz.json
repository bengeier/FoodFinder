{"text":"Me n my roommate came here this past Sunday, ALL the way from BTOWN, after calling down 1001 west indian food restaurants in Mississauga/Malton/Etobicoke that were all CLOSED on a Sunday at 7pm. Like REALLY? Mandarin and pizza pizza stay steady open but NO Caribbean joints? SMFH.

So of course you can imagine my sheer utter delight to find this NEW spot, after scrolling hopelessly through Yelp, that stays open til 11pm...!! NOW that's what I'm talking about.

We got to the restaurant, which was a little hard to find bcuz it is at the back not the front facing the street. We had already placed our orders over the phone and only had to wait an extra 5 mins once we got there (total wait time about 15 or 20mins). It is a small space, not suitable for dine-in but then again who really eats their food inside an actual Caribbean restaurant vs in the comfort of your own four walls?!? Ok then!

I had got the boneless curry goat with dhal puri roti  ($12) plus a side order of fried ripe plantains ($2.50). The plantains was DOPE - 5 LONG thick slices, & NOT overripe and drenched in oil like some people like. The curry goat was really nice too, well flavored/spiced, not skimpy on the meat, good chunky potatoes. Oh the curry goat also came with a free side, either coleshow or potato salad. I had the potato salad and it was creamy/smooth and SPICED. Probably the best non homemade potatoe salad ive ever eaten.

I will def be back to this joint! The owners are super friendly and because the place is now, they have these little coupons you can use if you come back to get 10% off your order or a free side etc. Next time I'm trying the curry chicken with paratha roti."}
{"text":"This place has awesome chicken roti. My favourite dish is the goat curry. A must try in Mississauga. Take out only."}
{"text":"Eating this as we speak. I ordered the regular jerk chicken with potato salad and rice with a side of festival. Girllllllllll THIS FOOD IS BOMB AF.  I'm definitely ordering from here everything I have a craving for Caribbean  food."}
{"text":"The food is great. But the service is lacking. Even calling ahead to pick up. No one picks up the phone. Even when I get through and place an order, told it'll be ready in 20 mins and when I arrive they haven't boxed it yet. Now I have to wait 20 more minutes. Why even bother calling ahead? I don't understand. I'm happy you guys have opened, and I wish you all the success. But seriously. Get some better people in there or a better process."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in my books! This place makes the best oxtail with rice and peas in Mississauga. Came in to do a take out on Friday night and they had to close early which was fine but they were still very accommodating. The only thing they didn't have that I wanted to try was their plantains. 

The place is a small joint where you can go in and order for take out or sit outside in the patio section, but there were no chairs when I visited, I'm guessing because they were closing. 

We ordered regular(they're small size but super filing) oxtail with rice, full (large size, very generous portion) jerk chicken, goat and beef patty. The oxtail was so tender and fall off the bone good! The jerk chicken was amazing! Never had it so juicy and flavourful like that. The patty had an amazing filing, but I wasn't to thrilled about the patty yellow pastry itself only because I've tasted flakier buttery ones. This was good but not crispy and flaky like I liked it to be. Prices were not bad at all, typical prices and generous portions.

Overall this place is a MUST try!"}
{"text":"This review is based solely on the Jamaican Patties. Had a craving, what can I say?
These were the best patties I've ever had. I will definitely come back here for more.
The staff was very friendly but I will note they only told me after I had ordered and paid that there was a goat curry patty option! The menu does not say which types of patties are available so I assumed your regular chicken, beef, and spicy options. 
This is not eat-in; plan to get takeout.
Note: The location is super sketchy. Not only is it the only storefront on the BACK of the strip mall, but the parking lot is in horrible condition."}
