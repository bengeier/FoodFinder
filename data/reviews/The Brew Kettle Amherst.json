{"text":"Meh...that's all I can say. I thought the first time I was here that since they had just opened that the food would improve. It did not. The pork is greasy and flavorless. Yuck. No zip to their food. Even the barbeque sauce is bland. Best thing was the dill slice."}
{"text":"I was served not a raw , but a spoiled meat bison burger. I have eaten bison anywhere it is served and decided to try one at the new hometown brew kettle. The meat was most definitely spoiled and there were no apologies only an offer of substitution. Sorry, I had no appetite after being served spoiled food."}
{"text":"First time here was with a party of 22. It did take a little while for our food but hey there was 22 of us. Our waitress was very friendly and kept drinks filled and got anything we needed. Food was very good. Love their coleslaw and dill dressing. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Everything was nice except the entrées themselves. Chicken Caesar wrap and Perch tacos were bland.com"}
{"text":"Very excited to try it out since the change from Church Street - but the hostess was not very friendly - didn't smile - and the service was very poor - not sure if our waitress was just having a bad night or what, but she was not friendly, and was slow to take our order - and it was not busy at the time. Slow to check on us, and very slow to bring our check when we were done eating. Food was disappointing - my wife had the fish tacos which were ... meh! I had a burger which was overcooked and dry.

Maybe they were just having an \"off\" night, so I will probably give them one more chance before I write them off entirely..."}
{"text":"Always had great service , food and beers. Everybody was knowledgeable and helpful. We were great with a larger party!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here 5 times since it opened. I want it to be better. The beer is exceptional which is why I have it 3 stars.. The problem is with the kitchen. Food is very uneven. In every order we have had, some parts have been served cold or under cooked. In. Every. Meal. The cheese tray, which was mentioned in other reviews, was astonishingly bad. Service has gotten better, but the kitchen remains a serious problem.
We need them to get better in the kitchen. Otherwise, we will eat at much better restaurants in the area and drink here. Such a shame."}
{"text":"Food was so so.... Service so so.  My expectations were set a bit higher.  I will drive out to Westlake next time.  Rather disappointing for all the hype."}
{"text":"The food was ok, but the service wasn't great.  Avoid the broccoli cheddar soup (way too salty) and Dijon vinaigrette dressing (had a bite to it).  Portions were big, but good was mediocre.  The beer was a little warm, but tasted great.  It's my fault for ordering wine at a beer place, but the wine was terrible."}
{"text":"Highly Disappointed! 

The first impression started at the hostess desk with no one smiling. The feeling of being welcomed was not present. We were then walked through the majority of the restaurant to find an available table and our table ended up being one right by the entrance - how embarrassing to have to parade through the restaurant and then be brought back to the front. 

We then waited almost ten minutes before being acknowledged by a server. She was very abrupt and made us feel like we were inconveniencing her. She never once asked if we'd been to Brew Kettle before or if we had any questions about the menu. This was really surprising being that this is a new restaurant in Amherst. 

Once our drinks arrived we were abruptly asked if we were ready to order. Everything was matter of fact! This server was extremely rude and disrespectful and is someone I'm most certain your owner would not want representing his/her company. Our food arrived in about fifteen minutes, which was the most positive part of our visit. 

However, the positive quickly turned bad again. The pulled pork sandwich bun was soggy -and we're talking wet soggy, yuck! The chili was very pasty and dry. The broccoli was hard and laying in water and the rice pilaf was very bland. The Cajun chicken pasta was good, but dry. When I asked the server for a side of sauce to add to it I was told I couldn't have any because they make the sauce only when they prepare the dish!! 

One thing that was good was the coleslaw. The dill flavoring is awesome! Needless to say, we couldn't get full on coleslaw :( 

We had to ask for refills and when our server brought us our check she tossed it at us ( literally ! ) and said something as she was walking away from the table, but we couldn't hear her. It sounded like Happy Holidays, but we couldn't tell because by then her back was to us.

We have visited the Strongsville location and have always had a positive experience, but not at the Amherst location. 

We're in hopes things will get better in time, but for now we will be visiting other local restaurants. Right now is not a good time to spend your hard earned money at the Brew Kettle in Amherst."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant! It's made me into a regular. They have some of the best buffalo wings I've ever had. The jalapeño cornbread is sweet and spicy and perfect!!! They have a wide and great beer selection. The restaurant itself is always clean and beautiful. I'm so excited to have brew kettle closer to home."}
{"text":"Rough start with poor attention from our waitress to start, but I wouldn't let that ruin my evening. The Pig Burger (a burger with pulled pork on it) was great with come classic french fries on the side. Cole slaw with it was a good touch. Overall satisfied and will return when im in the area"}
{"text":"Let's start with the building is beautiful! No wonder it took so long to open! The inside went through a total 360 makeover. I love that the patio is very large for the summer months. 

My boyfriend and I were told the service is lacking here from some friends and they unfortunately were right. WE waited over 5 minutes for someone to even arrive to seat us at a table. Many of the servers looked at us but no one helped us. The girl who sat us told us our server would be right over after a few minutes it ended up being her- very strange.

The food is the exact same as the Strongsville location. I got a chicken tenders salad and really enjoyed the honey mustard dressing and my boyfriend ordered the Pulled Pork Spaghetti. This item is not my thing but he loved it.

$3.25 for all Brew Kettle beers on Sundays."}
{"text":"Nothing special.  Most of the time I try to get food from here, I try to order take out from work.  More than half the time either the phone rings endlessly, or an automated message picks up and says something about a customer service representative, which is kind of weird.  A more engaged owner/franchisee could probably run this place better"}
{"text":"Service was bad..... Nice atmosphere but that isn't why I went. Good service is a priority for me."}
{"text":"This is an awesome restaurant with a great deco.  Lots of brew kettle beers on tap as well as numerous other breweries.  Food is awesome and I recommend the smokehouse wings."}
{"text":"Hard to say anything bad about this place.

The beer selection is good and I love the flight format. You can find something for everyone to drink.

The decor is slightly bland but hey, you're probably too drunk to care anyways, it's a brewery. It's February and the Christmas wreaths are still up, get with it BK. Jokes aside, it's clean and looks fine.

The food is the real winner in this place. If you aren't getting some form of smoked meat then you are doing it wrong. Had the pulled pork sandwich every time I have been here and it tastes like it is marinated in Jesus tears and pulled apart by tuscan virgins. Also, if you are a fan of horseradish, try the coleslaw.

Overall, I like the original location better but this is a fine addition to my local establishments and I will continue to frequent here."}
{"text":"I recently went to the Brew Kettle for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. I'm not a beer drinker so I can't comment on the beer. The food was very good, though. I had the perch tacos and it was refreshing to have perch that wasn't saturated in the usual beer breaded batter. It was breaded in bread crumbs, I believe and the sauce and toppings were excellent. The sweet potato fries were good as well. 
Service was a little on the slow side, but I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"By far the worst restaurant food I have ever had. I ordered the sampler platter which had ribs, chicken wings, pulled pork fries and slaw. The ribs and chicken were burnt to a crisp and barely edible, pork was mostly fat and mushy. Only about half the fries were edible as the bottom ones were soaked in fat. I was brought out a piece of bbq chicken as a replacement and it was soaked in disgusting open pit sauce and chicken was over cooked and dry."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but the bartender Tara is too loud and treats the rest of the staff crappy. They are all afraid of her and I don't want to hear her yelling at everyone.   Josh the bartender was great and must have a lot of patience to work with Tara."}
{"text":"Good service, excellent food. I have yet to be disappointed in my 3 visits thus far. The brat burger, wings, and perch tacos are all fantastic."}
{"text":"The beer is fantastic and the food was very very good. I sat at the bar so I have no idea what the table service was like. Very helpful and friendly bar staff.  Definitely going back whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"The patio and the beer selection here are fantastic! The service and food however, leave much needed room for improvement. I have only had a decent meal here once out of the 3 times I went. I will still go sit on the patio and have a drink, but I doubt I would ever eat here again. The wings were so burnt I could not eat them. I understand they are smoked but they were black and inedible."}
{"text":"We used to go every week. Took a long break because we weren't happy with food. Went back this Wednesday and it's even worse. Menu is boring and food is bad. Service slow at the bar. We won't go back. Much better food out there"}
{"text":"Being one of the newest restaurants in Amherst, you cant go wrong.  My personal favorite is the coconut milk stout and for dinner the sausage and perogies.  Must try the pretzels....  sports are on all the tv's and the music each time I have been here has been either alternative or contemporary.  The fish and chips is a family favorite"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there about two years ago. There was only one other table and one person at the bar. We had to wait just to find someone to seat us. The waitress was nice when she finally showed up, but was slow to come back to see if we needed anything else. The food wasn't bad but not great. Prices were a bit too high for the quality of both service and food.  The new decor was nice, but maybe more money should have been spent on better food and better trained employees.  We are from Amherst, but won't be in a big rush to return anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went there last night and was shocked as to how nice the atmosphere is. Looks nothing like how Church Street was. Was greeted by a friendly host and was suggested to go to the bar. So we walked to the back bar where and took a seat at the last two chairs. It was pretty busy. After about 10 minutes with no greeting by a bartender, I noticed that at least 3 other people at the bar had empty glasses and looked annoyed. After another 5 minutes still no greeting or drink. So, we got up and left. Notified the hostess about the bad service. Went to Ziggys and got a drink within 5 minutes.

The bartenders at Brew Kettle need to pay better attention to the guests. They also need to have a dedicated bartender at the back bar on weekends. They focused strictly on the front bar and totally ignored the back bar. I would have even been happy if we got an acknowledgement (smile or a \"we'll be right with you\" from someone, but nothing. 

Sad to see such a nice looking place have such poor service. Step it up!"}
{"text":"Awesome place.....

Great food! Absolutely one of the best brew houses I've been to.

Interesting but exciting twist on bar-b- q!

The place is clean! Very clean!

The employees take pride in what they do !

Roger our waiter was fantastic.

Great recommendations for food and beer!

An absolute must place !"}
{"text":"We had the most amazing experience, I had a veggie burger, which was definitely one of the best veggie burgers I've had. Sam served us, she was extraordinarily! The place is 2 minuets away from the highway and opened till late which makes it a perfect choice for travelers looking for good food and beers."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and had the same server both times. I wish I remembeded her name because she was very nice and tentative. She made good craft beer recommendations based on my usual Coors Light beer taste. She suggested the Big Woody which is very good. I had the wings abd they were awesome whole wings with a slight char on them. The wife had some red bean hummus thing. I hate hummus but this was so good I had her make it at home for me. (add a splash of hot sauce)"}
{"text":"[I'd give 3.5 stars if I could.]

Generally very good food, nice atmosphere, and prices are quite reasonable. You'll not find anything even remotely original on their menu, but then again, you don't always need that. Everything we tried seemed fresh and was flavorful. Service was efficient without being intrusive."}
{"text":"Excellent El Lupulo Libre Imperial IPA is always my favorite. The Lake Erie Perch was delicious but also disappointing for their size and the cost. Sure they provided 5 filets but they were super tiny. They could have provided 2 additional filets for the 15 bucks."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good (no ranch though wtf?) and they have a pretty large selection of beer. It's a great looking place and I enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"Ok I've been here about 20 times since it's opened.  I love the beers.  $4 Brew kettle beers can't be beat for craft.  3.25 during the day even better.  Have had the smoked wings a few times, very good.  Brisket sandwich was only ok a bit dry.  Pulled Pork has been fantastic and on Thursday only $6 it's a steal.  Do not get the sausage and cheese plate.  It was not sausage but little pieces of sliced pepperoni and salami.  With a ton of crackers.  I expected actual sausage like served with the perogies which were good.  

Service is always pretty fast and everyone friendly.  Bar tenders are all great and know the beers.  Wait staff know more about beer than any waitress at most other area places.  

I think they are working out the kinks and will be around for a long time.  Managers are always visible.  One complaint, staff should wear name tags.  

If you don't think you like craft beer they have plenty of beers you can try that you might actually wind up liking if you have an open mind.  Bud light is universally ranked one of the worst beers on the planet, try something good for a change!"}
{"text":"Service was great with very friendly staff. We had a party of four, prime rib was great, the burger with pulled pork was spot on and the BBQ spaghetti was great. The mac n cheese wasn't the best but i got it with broccoli and not sausage. Spinach dip was the best we've ever had and the buffalo dip was great! Many different types of beers to chose from however I prefer mixed drinks. The long islands are to die for. We plan on visiting again in the near future."}
{"text":"The décor of the restaurant is very tastefully done. The selection of craft beer seems abundant. I am not a beer drinker so I can only comment on the food and the service. The service was attentive, there when you needed anything, and made sure you had the proper place settings. The food however was not that great. I ate there on 3 separate occasions to make sure It wasn't an isolated incident. The food seemed really meh... I am a fan of BBQ any way you make it, but I can honestly say this BBQ was not that great. I did have the pulled pork sandwich the first time, BBQ spaghetti the second, and the burrito the third. Trying it a different way each time for versatility...Each time leaving me wanting something different. The one good thing about that place is the coleslaw... that is amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is always on point, lovely decor. CoD was prepared perfectly. Sweet potato fries were delicious with recommended butter dip"}
{"text":"I enjoyed their fish tacos. I will come back again for that. The beer list is long but way too many overly hoppy beers on there for the average drinker. Service is starting to suffer on the bartender side of things. Ended up leaving because of the lack of service.  This is a 1-2 beer bar stop for me."}
{"text":"Great food and some good beer to go with it. I've stopped in twice now since it opened and I was not disappointed at all. I've recommended The Brew Kettle to friends and family many times and brought some with me on my couple stops in. 

I will definitely go back again if/when i can."}
{"text":"We were a party of four for dinner on 12/14 and the food and service was very good compared to our previous visits! Keep up the improvement...you have a lot to offer! H2"}
{"text":"First time visitor and pleased with our choice.  There were 17 of us which can be quite challenging, but our server took good care of all of us.  

There is a great beer menu and I chose the Irish red which I enjoyed.

I had the buffalo chicken wrap which I really liked.  Had some different ingredients than normal, but it was a good \"hot\" and quite tasty.   The coleslaw was good as well, made the way I like it.  The biggest disappointment was the Mac and cheese which was horrible.   It was all mushy and looked like mashed potatoes.  Taste was sweet and bad.  Everyone that got it didn't eat it.  

The place was booming and everyone seemed to be enjoying their food.   Most people at our table were happy with their choices."}
{"text":"So so happy that the Brew Kettle has opened a location in Amherst. The food, beer selection and service is excellent. The venue is so nice and they did a great job with the design. This is just what Amherst needed to make uptown complete.

I have been anticipating the opening for a long time and it was worth the wait. The food came out very fast despite the fact that the bar was packed. We came on opening night and everyone working was calm and collected, like pros. 

I have to say the wings are amazing! I also recommend the deep fried green beans and the buffalo chicken wrap. As far as the beers on draft, there are so many good choices. My favorite is the Brew Kettle's own - White rajah (IPA) . Two thumbs WAY UP!! :)"}
{"text":"Not a good first impression.  I went to dinner with a party of 7 and it took over 90 minutes to get our meals.  And when we did get our meals, my meal was cold (pulled pork sandwich) and my wife's burger was burnt (more bun than burger).  Our server was very nice and apologetic - it was obvious the problem was in the kitchen.  The table next to us waited 75 minutes to get their meals, so our experience was not isolated.  Great atmosphere and a great selection of beer. I have been to their other location in Strongsville several times and the food & service was always very good.  I live very close to their location in Amherst and I am willing to give them another chance because they are local.  I did greatly appreciate that the manager took 50% off our bill b/c of our experience.  Please fix the problem with your kitchen staff!"}
{"text":"Our original dinner plan didn't work out and we chose this was our second option. It ended up being a good dinner for our back-up plan.

The inside of the restaurant is nicely decorated and clean. The industrial design does create a loud atmosphere. 

The beer menu is impressive with about 40 options. There are not only Brew Kettle beers offered, but beers from breweries around the country as well. Beers were offered in sizes as small as five ounces which was perfect for tasting. I had Brew Kettle's 4 C's which was a nice pale ale with a bit of a pine flavor. My other beer was Southern Tier's Cheery Gose. I loved that tart cherry flavor. It was a great beer.

The food menu is not exotic, but does offer a nice variety of options. For starters I had a Side Salad which had several different veggies and homemade croutons that really made the salad. My main entree was the Sausage and Pierogi Platter which delicious. The sausage was cut in halves so it had a nice grill char and flavor. The pierogis were delicious. My dad had the Perch Tacos which he loved and was a generous three tacos. I like that they make the tacos with local fish. My mom had the Pulled Pork Sandwich which she liked, but the sauce was on the side instead of cooked into the meat. She thought it would have been more flavorful if the meat had been cooked in the sauce.

I thought this one of the better options for food and drink in the downtown Amherst area."}
{"text":"This was my first time to this place. I didn't know what to expect. When we walked in, we were asked if we had made a call-ahead reservation. Um, no... It wasn't a problem though, and we were seated immediately.

I was disappointed in my appetizer-so-big-it-was-my-entree Nachos with Pulled Pork.There were copious amounts of large fatty pieces that I had to pick through or spit out. There was a chuck of what appeared to be bone on my plate. I don't feel like the pulled pork (what they claim to be known for) was great quality. 

The Triple Pig sandwich was ordered by 2 people in my 4 person group, and they both enjoyed it. It was a very large sandwich chocked full of porkloin, bacon and pulled pork."}
{"text":"I have to keep in mind I'm in Amherst Ohio, not be all hater hate on this small town of 12k but they are 10-15 years behind on food trends.  The original concept opened in 2003 not much changed lol.   I'm really a humble eater but I just was not impressed.  I did not try any beer so I can't say if it's good or bad.  The selection did look appealing the brew kettle Tunguska was 10.8% ABV so that would be my go to.  

The burger was chargrilled to the point I felt like I was chewing a piece of charcoal barely any seasoning.  It was all bun (that broke apart) not toasted at all. Cheese was not melted. Just a total disappointment like my 1st & 2nd husband 

The wings...I don't want to even talk about.  I gotta wash my brain out after those 

I may find my self coming back to try some beers but that's it.  Service was really good!!!  Just not crazy about my meal.  


On a side note why does everyone serve Pepsi here....ewwww just ewwwww"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to brew kettle,and we just came for drinks for my best friends birthday. It had rained earlier today so the patio was closed. Justino was so nice and accommodating. He double checked to see if he was able to open up the patio for us and wiped down or table and chairs for our group. Very happy with the service!"}
{"text":"This location has strayed far from the original Brew Kettle in Strongsville. The management are below par and feel that giving away free food will keep the customers coming back. Their inexperience shows when prompted with more than one task. Unfortunately, the food is overpriced and below average and is classified as nothing special(bar food). They really should just close the doors instead of going bankrupt."}
{"text":"The service was great but the food was ok at best. Their entire flavor base is to load everything down with pepper. It just wasn't for me or my family."}
{"text":"Seriously my favorite place to eat.  The food is fantastic, and I have never had an issue with the service.  I frequent here about twice a month.  The summer IPa's are my favorite, along with the buffalo chicken wrap, and of course their coleslaw.  Great for a date night, but kid-friendly, too!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here last night. I got the half smoked chicken special and my dinner date got the buffalo chicken salad. My entree came with au gratin potatoes and asparagus. My meal was fabulous. The smoked chicken was delectable. The smoky sent and taste were intoxicating. The meat fell of the bone. The potatoes were hearty and well-seasoned. The asparagus was fresh, tender, and buttery. My companion loved the buffalo chicken salad and chose the grilled chicken option. Beware, the buffalo sauce is spicy hot! Get lots of blue cheese to cut the heat. The interior of this restaurant is comfortable. This place is pretty big. Parking is good. Outdoor patio with TVs in a creative architectural setting. Service was very good as well.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We came in just a little over an hour before the kitchen closed with family from out of town. Our experience was awesome! Kelly took great care of us and made excellent suggestions. Food was great, slaw was amazing. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time just before Christmas. Service was fast. The food was good. Some interesting combinations of pasta and bbq. Great selection of beer."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times have not been impressed with my choice of entrees.  I have had the pulled pork burrito and the grilled chicken and neither one made a great impression.  The pork is very smoky and a bit dry.  The chicken was very bland, for sure could have used some seasoning and came with a huge piece of under cooked broccoli.  On a positive note (and the reason I will return), the appetizers are good (stuffed peppers and fried green beans).  I will be back to enjoy those things and of course the beer, I will just leave dinner for home those nights."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. The wings are smoked and then baked giving them a distinctive flavor in the area. The seasonal Winter Warmer was a mellow full flavored beer that really paired well with the wings. The only improvements I would make would be to add onion rings and mushrooms to the sides menu."}
