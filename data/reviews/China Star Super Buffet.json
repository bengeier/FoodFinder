{"text":"Reasonable priced and my dinner included a drink which I opted for hot tea.   I was really fond of the potato they had, however they have a decent amount of selection of food.  They even had Sushi which was a surprise.  Bonus points for taking amex.  Only downfall is resturant is in a sketchy intersection."}
{"text":"Update. As of July 6, 2012, It looks like this place is closed. Does anyone know for sure?"}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch with Norm R and Rand H.The place was big and well furnished.The chairs have castors on them which make it easy to get up for more food.They have a fairly wide selection of eats probably about 70 trays.It was your average chinese buffet selection with nothing really standing out as outstanding well except the mushroom chicken that was pretty good.Other than that it was just another not bad chinese buffet.I would eat there again but i would not put the place on my top ten.If your in the neighborhood and you want a quick lunch ,it is ok"}
{"text":"The lunch I had here was delightful, but the wonderful company (Rand H and Mike C)  and the pleasant atmosphere of the establishment are probably more responsible for that perception than the food itself. I found the quality of the food here to vary greatly from one dish to another. There was a chicken-and-mushroom dish that was truly spectacular, and  there were two kinds of fish: one fried, the other poached, both good; and this for me is truly a plus, as not too many Chinese buffets serve fish. The french fries (I guess all Chinese buffets have them now) were very good - I wish all places that serve fries served them this way. Most of the meat dishes were OK, as were the main starches, i.e., the fried rice (it wasn't greasy ... hooray!) and the lo mein. Most of the other dishes were adequate, and the desserts were mediocre and of store-bought quality. The one total flub was the egg flower soup, which was totally tasteless. My actual rating for this place is three and a half stars, but seeing that Rand H gave it that rating and decided to round it down to 3, I'm using the balance to round my rating up to 4."}
{"text":"My 2 or 3 coworkers amble down the street to China Star every few weeks when we're in the mood for typical Chinese buffet fare. This place does that as good as most in our I-17 corridor. Big plus is good crab rangoon. Service is pretty good with drink refills often. I'm not into the salad bar part but they've got a nice selection of items. The property used to be a Red Lobster and the maintenance has been marginal inside and out for what seems to have been 20 years or so since Cheddar Bay Buscuits called this place home. For us buffet junkies, this $7 sodium-gorgefest earns a 3.5."}
{"text":"Won't be going back.  They have replaced all their vegetable dishes with many versions of bland seafood.  Started several things but had to leave them on my plate because they did not have any flavor.  Great service but bad food."}
{"text":"Okay, so after reading a super hilarious recent spiel about the personal trainer and the Yelp Menace in Cali, I reread my review and decided that even if I don't want to patronize this establishment anymore, I want my review to be fair (and I don't want to be listed as a menace, now, do I). So since I rated the service a 1 and the food a 3.5, I think a 2 is a more appropriate overall score than my original 1. I forced myself to eat lunch there one more time to confirm that the food is tasty enough to warrant this adjustment, and it is.  I went around 2:00pm-ish to avoid trouble, and no, I did not bring Sam the watch."}
