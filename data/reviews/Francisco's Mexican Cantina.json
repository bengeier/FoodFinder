{"text":"This is a pretty solid Mexican option. It is close to the Capitol Building, so it's pretty centrally located. There is indoor and outdoor seating. The chips and salsa are great, but they are even better if you order queso sauce as well! Margaritas were good. I tried the seafood enchiladas, which were very good. My friends liked their food too. I would definitely go back for some good Mexican."}
{"text":"I've been here a lot for the lunch specials. This is not the top Mexican joint in Madison by any means, but they have a nice straightforward menu, good food and prompt servers. Food is always hot, and while the portions are a little small, they will still fill you up. Can personally recommend the chimichangas, enchiladas and the margaritas. Corona with a lime to top it off, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Don't let the mexican music and decor fool you. Place has no passion in its food.  Waitress was nice just doing her job. But food and presentation sub-par.

Food I ordered:

Salsa and chips: salsa was good but chips were a little stale. Use to getting warm fresh chips.

Shrimp Ceviche: Wow. Nothing close to what i grew up eating. I know people make it differently. I'm use to eating it with like a tomato juice and have a sweet tangy taste to it. This was more like a pico de gallo with shrimp, and avocados didn't look to fresh. Overall alright just because I like pico de gallo. But I did not order pico de gallo it was to be ceviche.

Torta with carne asada: Tried ordering the milanese meat(breaded steak). They did not have it and it was on the menu. How do you not have milanese at mex restaurant and it looked really slow that night. So I ordered it with carne asada. It was good just not up there on the top list of best tortas I've ever had. Lol. Not alot of savor(flavor) or passion. I will try other hispanic joints. Gracias."}
{"text":"This place definitely has a mantra: quick, delicious, and inexpensive. 

The steak tacos were perfect and less than $2 each, margaritas were made with fresh lime juice, sides were solid, and their house hot sauce was also very good. The salsa was a little watery but tasty. The location is convenient as well."}
{"text":"While we didn't have the best service, the food and drinks were fantastic and at a great price!  We'll certainly be back!"}
{"text":"A quick bite on a Saturday night, very fast and friendly service, good food and drink at a good price. Enjoyed the enchiladas verde."}
{"text":"Cheap, authentic mexican. Can't beat it for the price anywhere else on the square."}
{"text":"Fish tacos during lunch here a couple months ago. I'm pretty sure I got food poisoning from it. The fish tasted a little funky and against my better judgement, consumed it. Knocked out for 2 days solid. To boot, I think I paid 12 dollars for it."}
{"text":"I eat here on a weekly basis and am always satisfied. Good food and good service. Some outside seating."}
{"text":"9.99 pitcher of sangria, nice, cheap selection of beer, some of the best, most authentic Mexican food I've ever had. The shrimp ceviche was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Food is okay . Basic Mexican food not bad Francisco cooks Mexico City type cuisine.

I had a business lunch and ordered the shrimp enchiladas.  Shrimp was grainy, either they weren't cleaned correctly or were poor quality.  Other than that the enchiladas were okay.  I wouldn't order them again.

His aunt owns Guadalajara on Park St. That food there has always been delicious.  They cook northern Mexican style cuisine and they use El  Milagro tortillas from Chicago, the best!  Unfortunately for me, there was a fire a couple of weeks ago.  When they rebuild Check them out and compare,  you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the hype. Or maybe I just picked a bad day.  I ordered the traditional enchiladas and a tamale. My food was cold and part of the order was wrong. I love mole sauce but theirs tasted awful - too sweet, cold and no genuine spices. The chicken tamale was dry and hard.  I also ordered a side of beans - they were bland and coming out of the styrofoam box (they have to know that they would spill out-why not use something with a lid???) The place was almost empty yet the food seemed rushed and the staff were not very welcoming.  I stopped here because it was close but next time I'll travel. Usually I'm into second chances...not so much for this place. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm from Madison and I have a home there, but I have lived in the Mission District in San Francisco (where the burrito as we know it was invented) since 1997. I live a block from La Taqueria on Mission Street which, according to many people, is one of the top taquerias on the West Coast. I'm not boasting - I'm just establishing my Mexican food eater cred. Brothers and sisters, I know tacos.

I met a buddy there from lunch. He recommended we meet there. I'd never heard of Francisco's before then. My buddy grew up in Mexico City, then moved to Madison for college - and stayed. He's a helluva good judge of Mexican food.

Anyway, I've eaten at Francisco's  Mexican Cantina twice now in two days and I can totally couch for their tacos. Very good, authentic, delicious tacos. They feature generous meat portions - I recommend the Carne Asada, the Pastor, and Beef Tongue, cilantro and onions on two thick, tender tortillas. Their salsa verde has a little heat, but not at all too much, and I recommend it.

The chips and salsa are the real deal. I've even had the Flan and it was also very good.

I'm looking forward to going back and trying some of the platos and more specialty items, but I have been jonesing for tacos.

Great food.

Excellent service.

Great value for money.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Pretty inexpensive. The staff was super fast, really nice and attentive to our needs even with a full restaurant. I got sopes which were amazing and my bill only ended up being $6 before tip. I want to go back just thinking about it."}
{"text":"I love love love love this place.

I just got back from studying abroad in Mexico and I was dying to find a place at home where I could eat the same as I did in Mexico- and this place is it. Very authentic Mexican, from the decor to the food. I felt like I was back in Mexico again."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and the only thing that I don't like is that they can't accommodate larger groups very easily. It's a small place, so I understand. I'm in a larger band and before gigs downtown, we like to come here. The food is great, the beer is cheap, it's just a little hard for all of us to sit together."}
{"text":"Chips and Salsa was acceptable.  Service was good. But I came for the tacos and they sucked. The hunt continues to find badass tacos in Madison"}
{"text":"Great food, good prices.  Nothing not to like.

I had their enchiladas and it was definitely enough food.  They also have different daily specials and they deliver."}
{"text":"Many of my prayers for the Madison restaurant scene - finally answered

There will probably be some confusion at first as The Isthmus recently mentioned this restaurant, calling it Juquila.  However after chatting with Francisco himself last night, it's going to be called Francisco's Cantina for time being, as that's the name on the liquor license.  Asi es la vida.  

What's not confusing is the food and liquor.  It's a god send.  It's got the freaking trifecta:  (1) delicious (2) cheap (3) likely open after bar time (or your shift if you work in the industry).  Item (3) will become a reality soon when the man gets some more help in the kitchen.

I shared drinks and dinner with a good friend around 10pm last night.  We had the requisite chips and salsa.  A massive (had to weigh 5lbs) steak burrito with house-made mole negro and a plate with assorted, chicken filled, verde/rojo tamales.  We washed down said food with half a dozen shots of Camarena Blanco and cuatro Bohemias.

Total bill:  $41.  Seriously!  Why go anywhere else?  

Now it's time we all thank Francisco and our respective deities for gifting us an amazing restaurant that doesn't close at 9pm.  Go support this guy and his food else I'm gonna be mad at you Madison."}
{"text":"We went to Francisco's Cantina for dinner. First of all the food especially the entree is pretty cheap when compared to other Mexican restaurants around town. The people out there were very friendly. But the food wasn't really the best Mexican I have ever eaten. I had a chicken burrito and I thought it was decent at the very best. 

Overall compared to the price of the food I thought it was a nice place to dine in. If I am in the area I might again go back to Francisco's Cantina for lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"Lo m√°ximo. Great food, good staff, beautiful owner. One of the best late night bites in Madison."}
{"text":"I've only gotten delivery from Francisco's, but it's been a great experience all three times. Great chicken enchiladas. I'd definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This Mexican restaurant is pretty awesome for the Madison scene. My boyfriend and I frequent this place, and we have never been disappointed. The prices are great, and the food is tasty and filling. I usually get the burrito suizo, and the cheese sauce is amazing!! My boyfriend gets the quesadilla with a side of guac and always leaves happy. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for great inexpensive Mexican!"}
{"text":"Went to grab a quick lunch here with a friend last Friday.  We were luckily seated right away as it was pretty busy.  The first basket of chips and salsa is free, but any past that is extra.  I feel like it's pretty rare to find Mexican restaurants that charge for chips and salsa these days.  For drinks, I asked what they had (as the menu did not specify), and when I asked if they had horchata, the guy nodded and said \"horchata, ok.\"  
When our food came out 20-30 minutes later, I still had not received my horchata.  When I asked the waitress who delivered our food about it, she checked with the guy who took my order and then said that they didn't have horchata.  Fine, but you could have told me that when I first ordered, or checked on it and come back to let me know so I could potentially order something else. 
When they checked on our food, I asked for extra sour cream.  I waited a couple minutes for it to arrive, but then kept eating cause I was hungry.  I never received that sour cream.

On the plus side, the food was well portioned for the price and pretty tasty.  But the service could really stand to improve.  You're a restaurant on the square, you know you're busy weekday lunches, add more staff!  
I'm disappointed and probably won't be back.  There are other inexpensive Mexican joints that have much better service."}
{"text":"Seafood nachos are great! Great service and prices, will definitely come back"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican place in downtown madison for sure. Way better service and atmosphere than Los Gemelos. Amazing salsa--plenty of cilantro and fresh onion. The tostadas and tacos are my favorite. Close are the enchiladas verdes. Only skip is the quesadilla for me. Accommodating to groups and small parties-- we come here a couple times a month."}
{"text":"My first Blah review while in Madison

This place was recommended by the mixologist at Merchant. I wanted faijatas  and they said this was the place to go. We walk in and sit at the bar. For a place that's supposed to be real good there wasn't a lot of people inside. Maybe 2 tables and a couple at the bar. Mind you this was a Saturday Night around 6ish. Even my wife mentioned something about hardly anyone being here. My wife gets a lime Margarita and I get a Sol Beer. They pour her margarita from a pitcher that was inside a small refrigerator behind the bar. Now maybe I've been spoiled while visiting your town with all these made from scratch drinks but to see this was disappointing. To be fair, my wife said she liked it. 

 I order the chicken and shrimp fajitas with extra shrimp and extra tortillas. All to go. My order comes up and I double check it. It's missing the extra tortillas, which I was not happy about, and the sour cream and guacamole looks a little small so I want another one.  I tell the server and he brings me both items and says the guacamole etc was on the house for the mixup. That was cool. We call our hotel and they come pick us up. 

Service

I want to back up here and mention this. This was the first place we went to that the servers were not friendly. The one bigger guy looked like he didn't want to be there and didn't crack a smile once. The other one was eating behind the bar when we walked in and wasn't friendly either. Now if you two servers are reading this I want you to pay attention. I'm not asking you to walk around the restaurant like the joker with a smile permanently fixed on your face. But you should greet your customers with a smile and introduce yourself. It wasn't busy. It's called being a professional.  Make a damn effort is all I say. 

Food

The was nothing outstanding about these fajitas . It came with corn tortillas which I hate. I like the flour ones. Also it came with no cheese. The horror! Never had a fajita that didn't come with cheese on the side. Isn't NO cheese a crime in Wisconsin?  These were no different than Applebee's or Chilis. Honestly Chilis make a better fajitas than this joint. 

Verdict 

Go somewhere else. I think that about sums it up LOL Stay Hungry!"}
{"text":"The place was decorated very millennial, it was nice, neat and decent. The food was also very decent and fresh. We were a group of 3, we each other 2 plates and a pomegranate margarita.  My friend had the steak fajita with rice, my other friend had the steak fries and the fish tacos. I had the tacos dorados and the fish tacos. 
To me the steak fries and tacos dorados were a little greasy and didn't have much flavor. The fish tacos however stole the show, i mean they were on point, the abocado and the tortilla gave it a last touch. I would definitely eat them again if i go again to this place. Not giving them a 5 because  the service was slow and the it was too quite for me. I would of like to hear the music louder. And also because the drinks came after the food, usually the drinks come first and than the food. 
Overall a nice place to go check out"}
{"text":"Fuck this. I ordered the tacos dorados. Let me just save you the time and tell you: don't. The enchiladas were not enchiladas at all but rather fried pieces of corn tortilla and mush w a disgusting child sauce that tasted similar to armpit. The nachos were soggy and drowning in rubber steak. I already feel my stomach churning. Never again"}
{"text":"Their fish tacos were a solid B+, meat was under seasoned but the avocado and tortillas were divine. The service was slow and standoffish, which as far as I'm concerned make it a great lunch hideaway on a busy day. Sit at the bar and contemplate the tile as you enjoy the chunky salsa and really good chips. Will return!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid food, everything was delicious and a good value (4) I ordered the chicken quesadilla and a margarita, 
The service is a bit spotty, (3) my pal ordered something that was supposed to come with cactus and when it came without it she asked the waitress and she basically said they didn't have any. She was a bit frustrated that she didn't tell her when she ordered it! Which I can't really blame her for. 
Pitchers of margaritas are only $10.99 during happy hour... which is pretty spectacular. I am sure I'll be here again for the food and I hope the service gets a bit better. We had a decent sized group even though this place is on the small Sadie if you get her at the right time they can support pretty large groups."}
{"text":"Been in Madison 3 years. Hands down my favorite place to eat. Great service, good food, super cheap."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite Mexican spot in Madison. 
I know that's a controversial opinion, but allow me to explain.

First of all, the prices are fantastic. They may not be the cheapest in Madison, but they must be close.
Also, my boyfriend and I have become regulars (almost every other Friday night). The servers/owners are such sweet people and we really like supporting their business.

The salsa is homemade and pretty delicious. The only downside is they charge for a refill.
Their margarita pitchers can't be beat - for $13, they fill 4 full glasses, and they're definitely not weak.
I always order the Quesadilla Supreme. It's the only thing I've tried on their menu, but man is it tasty! Cooked perfectly with generous filling. The sour cream/guac portions look small, but I never end up wishing I had more.
My boyfriend orders a Burrito, plus a Gordita when he's really hungry, and it always fills him up (and he's a huge dude).

With chips & salsa, our meals, plus a pitcher of margarita, our total (including tax & tip) is usually about $38. Super reasonable!

For me, what separates this place from other Mexican restaurants in Madison is the ambiance & location. It's right by the capital and has a chill, non-pretentious atmosphere. Also, It's usually very easy to get a table.
Give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"We tried Franciso's Cantina on a recent Friday night. It's not a large space and it was only about 50% full. The restrooms are actually in a hallway out the backdoor and are shared by the restaurants/bars on either side. The space was clean although we did notice some cleaning supplies hanging out on some high-shelves that looked like someone forgot to put them away.

We were seated immediately and a server came by to bring us menus and take our drink orders. It's not a huge menu, but has most of the traditional Tex-Mex items we expect. Our server brought chips and salsa and took our food order. The salsa was fresh and light. The chips were dense and crunchy. There were noticeably fewer chips than at many Mexican restaurants, but still plenty to satisfy.

For dinner we had the tamales and the Carne Asada. The Carne Asada had great flavors. The meat was a little tough to bite through. Beans and rice were all fine. Lettuce, pico, and guacamole were all fresh. The tamales had a delicious sauce and didn't suffer from too much masa. The portion sizes again seemed a mite small by American standards but considering the reasonable prices I have no complaints.

It did take an unusually long time for our server to bring our bill. Especially since she came by and said \"I'll bring you your check.\", but then it took quite awhile after that to actually get it.

All in all, I would not hesitate to return if someone wanted to eat here or I happened to be walking by. I wouldn't make a specific effort to back though either. The food was tasty, the portions were small, the prices were reasonable, the service was mixed."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! Too bad cause food's not bad.. watched my food sit in window for at least 10 minutes while the 2 servers were on their phones, texting. We got over charged but they did correct the bill.  Never asked how our food was or if we needed anything  ( we all did). So, I had to flag them down. Not at all attentive, friendly or experienced..Damn millenials!!"}
{"text":"My tacos were authentic and delicious! The margaritas were SUPER strong and affordable. They even let me drink for free since it was my bachelorette party. I didn't realize how small the restaurant was, but that didn't change the quality of my experience at all. I would definitely come back. You probably would want to make a reservation for Friday and Saturday nights, though."}
{"text":"Takes forever to get your order. Stuff they describe isn't accurate, they add stuff not described.  And they don't pay attention to your detail on your orders."}
{"text":"I usually go to Francisco's during my late night food binges. I have to say I really love their steak sopes! The sopes come topped with tomato, lettuce, sour cream, and cheese. They are like little boats of fried goodness topped with juicy, tender meat and toppings. Make sure to ask for their spicy homemade salsa that they have in squirt bottles. It has a real nice kick to it. Everything else on the menu is pretty decent. My favorites are mostly the ala carte items: tostadas, tacos, and sopes. I don't really care for the rice and beans that most of the entrees come with. If you do stop in for a weekend late night snack, then be ready to expect a busy restaurant!"}
{"text":"I'll say it again, I really don't like writing bad reviews especially for local places. But hopefully business owners will find some insight to help them improve what they've got. 

Madison has a handful of Taquerias that offer similar menus--Taqueria Guadelajara, Los Gemelos, Tienda Los Gemelos, etc--and I've tried most of them. Francisco's was my least-favorite. 

In short, dirty menus, spacey service, and flavorless food don't entice a repeat visit. The staple taco came with dry chicken cubes on top of two oily, hard tortillas. Burrito suizo was dry, sauceless. It seemed like the staff were going through the motions, passionless for the food they were offering, which was sad to experience from a customer's standpoint. 

Next time, I will get tacos elsewhere."}
{"text":"Why anyone would go to Pasqual's while this place exists is beyond me. This typical Mexican place is priced affordably. The food is not anything that will blow your mind, but it's good. Really good. I had the burrito suizo, and found it to hit about every Mexican craving I get twice a week. Meat, beans and rice? Check. A rich and gooey cheese sauce layered over everything? Check. I ordered a side of pico de gallo and layered that on every bite to have as delicious of am Mexican experience as I've had anywhere in Madison.

If you're in the downtown area, it's hard to find better Mexican than this."}
{"text":"Just what we were looking for after a long day of wandering in Madison. Incredible authentic Mexican food, superb Margaritas, and the right size portions with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times recently, mostly because of some deals via an iPhone app. It's been really delicious!

I've had their tacos several times, and they really do hit the spot. The chicken and chorizo tacos are probably  my favorite, but the steak is fine too. The chips that are placed on your table are good, as is the salsa.

Their patio is very nice, with a good amount of seating available. A nice spot to sit and eat tacos, maybe have a couple beers. Even without any sort of promotion, the prices are decent. 

Also, the staff at Francisco's is great! Very friendly folks, who are attentive and simply do a great job."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in Madison. Everything my boyfriend and I have had is seriously delicious.  Starting with the salsa, to guac, to tacos, to chile rillenos- this place is good. I also love the cheese dip they offer- omg the cheese dip. So yummy. It is also in a great location and is open late night which is a huge plus! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"$10 - Margarita Pitcher's - How can you go wrong?

I would imagine that I could leave this review at just that and more than enough people would find it helpful but I did eat here as well so.....

I had the Steak-Shrimp-Chicken Fajitas and the other one had a veggie quesadilla :) We were both extremely happy with our meals. The portion size was generous and everything came out piping hot!

We don't do Mexican too often but this is one place I can picture us going back to.

FYI - Not a large selection of drinks on the menu and if you are looking for a fancy cocktail you will be best served elsewhere, they stick to a few different beers and Margarita's here!"}
{"text":"Our favorite stop downtown. You always hear that Madison has no good Mexican food. Almost true- except for this little gem. This place is 1) cheap 2) delicious 3) served by the nicest people 

Their beans are not thick and old. Their nachos own. Check out lunch specials for great deals. The sopes are the a delight, as are tamales. Nachos NOM. Fajitas mixed great deal. Roommates family is loyal to their mole over all others. 

Sometime open late for post- bars. Highly recommended by true Mexican lovers."}
{"text":"Extremely cheap, great food, awesome service, would recommend to anyone!! Had the quesadillas and taco plater, 10/10 would come back (aka us)"}
{"text":"I heard this is a shoot off of Guadelajara, my favorite place ever.... They need to up their game at Francisco's. The tacos were tough and really just not the same. The food seems like there's an overdose of sour cream everywhere. Even though they are open until 3am and serving lots of drunk people, they are slipping."}
{"text":"Food was great!! Nothing wrong there. Service was awful!! Our server seemed to be upset with every single request such as extra tortillas or a side of sour cream. It took 15 minutes to get my extra tortillas when I saw them in the window and asked the server she grunted at me and said they are coming. At the end of the meal she separated the check incorrectly and had originally ordered some incorrect items. Food was great but if a server is going to get irritated over simple requests or make grunting noises at me, I will not go back."}
{"text":"First, let me say this: so, so much more convenient than venturing down S. Park St. to Tacqueria Guadelajara. It's owned by the owner's (of TG) nephew, but the location is so much more convenient! Prices are pretty cheap ($1.70/taco) and the food is excellent. If you go at lunch, you may be lucky enough to see Francisco, who came out and chatted with us last time we were there. Delicious chips and salsa, and they came with free tortilla soup!

Oh, but the food...the tacos were excellent. Personally, my favorite was the pastor, but the chorizo/chicken/steak were all superb. I've had just about everything on the menu, and it's all great. Highly recommended!

UPDATE: Docking Francisco's a star. The food is good, but after going to La Guanajuatance? Francisco's is simply mediocre."}
{"text":"Good. It's a nice cheery and spacious interior, and the food is extremely affordable. They have possibly the cheapest tacos in town and they do it right (2 corn tortillas, cilantro, onion). The steak was of decent quality, pastor was largely fat and grizzle, very disappointing, but sometimes you just get the unlucky serving. They could really sear the meat more, as the best taco happens when protein is charred and then dowsed in vinegar, citrus, and peppers. Salsa was OK. Overall worth a visit, especially after a few drinks, but there are better taquerias in town."}
{"text":"Francisco's is a great option for getting your fix of Mexican food.  I kind of have a checklist for things I look for in restaurants like these, so i'll go down the list:

Free chips/salsa? - Check, to an extent.  The first basket is free, then the next is $1.50-75, which is reasonable enough.
Margaritas? - Check, and you can get them in gigantic sizes.  I've had better ones, but these ones do the job.
Big Burritos? - Check.
Family run establishment? - Check.
Cheap? - Check.  None of the Burritos run over $8, and there's plenty of options for under $6.
Open late? - Check, but only on Fridays and Saturdays.  Other nights it's until 10.

To top all of that off, it's in a superb location, right off the Capitol square, an area with a lot of restaurants that are either American or more expensive.  So, it stands out on its own there.

I'm giving Francisco's a 4, because there are some things they could be doing better.  Sometimes the service isn't superb, and the menu is just standard fare done well, unlike a couple other places in town like El Dorado or Tex Tubb's.  A place like this at most locations would only be a 3 in my book, but the great Capitol spot bumps it up a star."}
{"text":"Love going here for a quick and delicious lunch break. Food is great (and cheap!) and a nice spot for people watching if you grab a seat near the windows. Would recommend getting there before the noon hour to avoid the initial rush since seating is limited inside. If you're looking to get a drink, they have a full bar with the works. 

Pretty basic Mexican food menu (not saying that's a bad thing). You get chips and salsa right away, followed by a hot bowl of simple soup, which is nice during the winter because it can get chilly in there.

My go-to is the enchiladas verdes. Mmmm."}
{"text":"We wanted chips, salsa, and margaritas. It was a small request for a dining experience, but one we have had a hard time finding in Madison. Diving right into our basics.

Chips - Meh
Salsa - Okay
Margaritas - Made whenever and just okay

The margaritas actually were poured from a pitched behind the bar like kool-aid instead of being made fresh. Better than a mix, but not a promising start. The fajitas were just okay with the steak being more jerky than meat and the burrito mostly lettuce with a side of chicken. We won't be back unless the other mexican places in town are just as bad."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!  It has a very comfortable atmosphere and the staff is very friendly.  I'm a pain in the butt and prefer flour tortillas with my enchiladas and they are always more than willing to accommodate!  Very authentic."}
{"text":"This is THE place to go if you're on the East side of the square at bar time and you're hungry. The food is very good, it's cheap, and they're open very late.

Don't go here if you've only got 20 minutes--you'll be waiting a while for the food.  But the staff are great, and as I said, the food's even better.  So far, I haven't found a better spot for mole in Madison.  Also?  The portions are pretty huge.

Sometimes it can get pretty loud (well duh--it's a restaurant that caters to the late-night crowd).  Someday I'll have to try it during regular hours..."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I had a terrible experience at this establishment. We all work in the service industry so we were being very patient and more than forgiving. We waited 30 minutes just to be greeted (thank god we weren't on a time crunch), which meant we had to go and find our server and tell him that we wanted drinks, an apppetizer, and waters. The drinks took another 15 minutes to arrive, the waters another 10 after that, and then we finally got to order. The food was great! After our meals, we were told that the printer was out of paper and that we couldn't be provided with an itemized check. My girlfriend paid with her debit card which was presented on paper, when asking though,  we were told the checks were printed on different paper. Right. Then out of curiosity, we added up our total (tax included) and found out that we were charged $17 over what we should have. I've been here other times with my girlfriends and have never had this poor of an experience. To not be presented with an itemized check was questionable. We won't be back."}
{"text":"We decided to check this place out due to the yelp stars. We got a table for 4 inside by the window right away. The server was rushing around. Well we soon realized she was the only server for inside, outside and was also the bartender. It was soooo crazy. We started with ordering guacamole and the bean dip. She brought us the chips and dips, no salsa. The dips were just ok. The bean dip not impressive at all. The chips lacked flavor and needed salt. We all enjoyed our meals but the service was literally 1 star. Why do they only have one server to run the entire restaurant on a Thursday night??? We felt like we could not ask for anything...all we wanted was some chips and salsa and she gave a look like she could not believe we were asking her. Oh and when the meal came we asked for napkins and when she delivered them she threw them in the middle on top of our chips. Service this horrible makes for a bad night out. It really ruined our experience and it is a bummer too because we were really looking forward to this place. The main meals were good but just not enjoyable with the overall experience. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The tacos, while having good flavor, were seriously lacking on quantity of meat. Ordered 3 and the meat in all of them could have fit easily in 1 small tortilla.  For $2 each you can get much better tacos at Tex Tubb's. Margarita was standard. Would have been 2 stars but the service was really good."}
{"text":"Taco al pastor is very good.  Mole Pablano is very good. Great service and prices that can't be beat for a downtown restaurant. All food is super fresh and the place is very clean. I peeked in the kitchen...spotless.  go here."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food in the city, and they serve proper mole. Their tortilla soup is wonderful, their tacos are phenomenal, their enchiladas top notch. Great, authentic Mexican."}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience here with my girlfriend. I tried everywhere to find authentic carne asada and I found that it is no easy task in Madison. As it turns out, most places just attempt a tex-mex steak and hope you do not know any better. I spent the better part of an hour looking for places that had it and authentic food that had not been Americanized beyond all recognition. It is a quaint hole in the wall type of restaurant. The prices are amazing, the service is fast and food is great. I highly recommend this place. It is the first Mexican restaurant I mention when someone asks me about Mexican food here in Madison."}
{"text":"Authentic quaint Mexican restaurant. Decent sized portions, great taste"}
{"text":"My only regret in going to Francisco's is that I went on a night I was going out afterwards and my healthy portion of leftovers didn't get to come along. Francisco's is insanely inexpensive and offers up huge plates - I was hungry and I could only put away half my chimichanga, and the burritos are easily 3-4 servings. Their rice is some of the tastiest I've ever had - I've been contemplating bringing in a Tupperware container and asking them to just fill it up so I can eat it for a week straight. If you want to get full fast and on the cheap, mosey on down East Main."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon after the farmer's market.  My wife had fish tacos and I had a chimichanga.  Food was delicious, loved the bit of spicy sausage in mine.  Chips and salsa was great, service was fast and friendly, we will check this place out again when we are in town."}
{"text":"I'd give 3.5 but my 3stars are usually just another way of saying average eyyy.

It's been said. CHEAP, QUICK, & Good. 
I won't order the Seafood Chimmy again. The other Yelper got a lot of shrimp & no crab. I got the whole pkg of crab & 3 shrimps. But my former boss plate looked superb. 

Seat yourself. Chips & salsa upon sitting * all (soft)drinks come from the bar wand - I get water but noticed 12pk of Mt. Dew under the cabinet* LUNCH fills up quick * We were served some spaghetti/noodle dish after chips & salsa but before ordering. I tried it & it's nothing I'd make a priority for but it's a sweet gesture. 

MADISON SHOULD GET READY FOR  A STAND IN LINE PLACE AND WAIT TO BE SEATED. I'm glad we've got a place downtown now I don't have to trek over to Guadalajara on Park but I still had to walk my lunch off. I didn't bring home anything (e.g. as in I ate it all right there, lol sad but true)."}
{"text":"Spiffy (anytime I use a word that ends with a \"y\", as in \"nifty\" or \"flashy\" I feel it is a man-card violation.  Not a red card, probably just a yellow card...but a violation nontheless) little (arguably another minor man-card violation...things must be bold and brawny, not little...too cutsie) Mexican joint that offered a heckuva (now that word definitely connotes manliness) deal on a plate of tasty (damn did it again) enchiladas.  Margheritas (now I did it...I should be drinking bourbon) were solid as well.  I mean, they were liquid, but solid."}
{"text":"I'd give 3.5 stars if I could. An inexpensive, no frills Mexican restaurant near the square. Margaritas come in a pint glass and are not overly sweet. Plus, mine had real lemon pieces in it, so it's better than your average made-from-concentrate restaurant margarita. The food wasn't amazing, but it wasn't bad either - especially for the price. One standout was the salsa. It was clearly fresh and you could taste the cilantro. It's definitely worth a visit if you are looking for Mexican food downtown and the food carts aren't out!"}
{"text":"Yum! Very similar to other Mexican places around, except with a little more flavor. (Pretty sure there's lard in those beans.) and so cheap! We almost felt bad using our Bucky Book coupon. The one down side - SO LOUD. Tall space, brick walls, open door, and full of people. We could barely hear each other talk."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night with some friends- there was a bit of a line but it moved fast.  Really liked the cute atmosphere.  It was a tiny seating area, but I loved the traditional Mexican d√©cor and cantina feel.  The menu had a good variety of options, including vegetarian items and a kids menu, all at very reasonable prices- I got the vegetarian Burrito Mexicano for $8.90 which was really tasty.  It had some (maybe too) spicy guac and a cheese sauce on top-yum!  It was missing salsa, which was odd for a Burrito Mexicano, but it was still really good.  The complimentary chips and salsa were good as well and (almost) made up for the subpar service, although there was literally only one waitress for the entire restaurant, so it was understandable.  Cute place for good Mexican food- would go again for sure."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, I believed in second chances on subjects like love and bad dining experiences.  This restaurant restored my ability to toss that cognitive bias rationale like last week's fish wrapped in newspaper headed for the landfill.  The place is usually packed at bar time,  but anyone who tells you that it is somehow representative of the benchmark of this cuisine is either a sadist or a moron.  It's too bad, because a city of Madison's size and diversity deserves a late night Mexican spot at least as good as what you'll find in Milwaukee's Walker's Point neighborhood.  Let's start with the fucking room temperature beans, which tasted like they came out of a can boosted from a minimum security prison.  Most of the other ingredients used here tasted like they could also have been borrowed from the same correctional facility.  I mean, they give prisoners starchy food for a reason-so they feel like taking a nap instead of causing a fucking revolt.    Most of the reviews for this place were probably posted by well-meaning college kids that were just happy to have something convenient in their stomach after a hormone-fueled bender (cause let's face it, greasy low grade food is an acceptable substitute when you ain't gonna get any sex that night-am I right, kids?).  Ignore those reviews, and ignore this place unless you want to feel like leading a prison riot after your meal runs through you like the number three express train in NYC."}
{"text":"Francisco's does Mexican via American staples well.
Everything tastes great, although Mercado Marimar & Taquer√≠a Guadalajara are more authentic in my opinion.

However, what Francisco's lacks in taste/authenticity (which is really very little), it makes up ten fold in hospitality, atmosphere & service.  It's the perfect place to go with friends for lunch, dinner, or post-bar-close emergency meal because it's warm, welcoming & laid back.

And did i mention it's OUTRAGEOUSLY cheap!??"}
{"text":"Only thing I would add as a negative no one ever came back to refill my drink or the chips kinda disappointed in that"}
{"text":"Food was good, not an overwhelming amount like some places give, but satisfying.  Cheap too, $28 for two with drinks."}
{"text":"Coming from California, I've been suffering from carne asada fries withdrawals. I honestly had no idea this was a west coast thing, correct me if I'm wrong. After sifting through Yelp, we found out that this place served Carne Asada Fries. I was on a mission to try these, of course!! The first time we went, they didn't have any potatoes so I just got a chimichanga, which was good! The second time my SO and I came here, it was on another Sunday afternoon and we ordered right away. 

The chips and salsa they served us was quite good, and it had the right amount of heat for a spicy/hot food sensitive gal like me. We got sopes as an appetizer and our server was extremely awesome and got us two even though I had only ordered one. The sopes tasted so good that we were contemplating getting two more, until our fries came! They use freshly made crinkle fries and top it off with carne asada, melted cheese, pico de gallo, guac, and I had them add shredded cheese and sour cream on mine. It wasn't mind blowing but it was still pretty darn good! 

I'm officially a regular because of this lone menu item. If any Yelpers know of any other place that serves Carne Asada Fries, do let me know! :)"}
{"text":"I dined here tonight and had a rather average and greasy relleno that came with a rather sparse dollop of rice and beans. The enchilada sauce was rather watery. A little bit of garnish like lettuce and tomatoes would help the presentation a lot.

Like many restaurants in the Midwest, it seems that they fry the rellenos ahead of time, refrigerate and then microwave them. Therefore, it wasn't crisp at all... In New Mexico, most restaurants will deep fry the relleno right before they bring it to the table, resulting in a very crispy tasty treat. I don't know why more places around here don't do that."}
{"text":"Instead of using an ice scoop for my glass the dipped my pint glass In the ice to scoop. Also I was still starving after I ate. My burrito was filled mostly with lettuce"}
{"text":"I do like that they are an \"authentic\" option right off the square, has outdoor seating, is open later after bar time and is very affordable. I think their dishes are just okay tasting. Nothing too unique. A bit basic and the portion seems small for some of the dishes but for their price you can't really expect much more. Staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Want some yummy home style Mexican food fast? Then this place is for you. Fast, tasty, and not badly priced either. My go to order is the Enchiladas Vallarta. It is seafood enchiladas in creamy white sauce and served with beans and rice.  I have also tried a few other entrees and they have always been solid. 

When I go with a group we usually get a pitcher of Margarita's. I prefer the strawberry over lime as they use really strawberries in them. Overall you cannot beat the value here. It is a nice hidden downtown gem."}
{"text":"Had some very tasty food here.  We had tacos, beans and rice, and huevos mexicanos. Guacamole \"dip\" (huh?). Chips and salsa of course. Margaritas too. Ok, now for the review: the margaritas were served in a pint glass! Poor presentation for sure, but, the margaritas were made well, they were good.
The tacos were chicken and were spiced/cooked excellently. The frijoles were very soupy, could have been thicker but were very tasty. Rice was standard Mexican rice, I always use salsa and/or hot sauce to make them more interesting. There were two hot sauces, green and red. The green was a mild tomatillo, the red a hot one made with Arbor del Diablo chiles I think, or at least similar to those. Small red chiles. The red was EXCELLENT! It made the rice way better.
The huevos had of course onions, peppers and tomatoes and were also excellent. 
On our visit, we sat inside, and we were alone in there, but the sidewalk tables were just about all occupied. Service was good. I liked the decor inside with the dia del muerte graphic, and brick wall."}
{"text":"For my 12:30am night time hunger, this place definitely hit the spot. The tortilla chips came out quickly and we're warm. I also ordered the seafood chimichanga, which was unique to me. Had bell peppers, onion, crab, and shrimp inside. So delicious. The fried tortilla was perfectly crisp but easy to eat. The food also came out quick .. probably because we were one of three other tables there. This is a great alternative to Ian's pizza post bars, although this is more sit-down than line up for food."}
{"text":"This place was a really fun time! Came here with some friends to check it out. We were all really happy with our food. I got the Chile rellenos and it was served with tortillas. I was curious how the tortillas would came into play, but then I realized that you chop up the chile rellenos and put in the tortilla. I don't think I can ever order a chile rellenos unless it comes with the tortilla. It was so tasty and I'm still dreaming on this dish. 

We also ordered pitchers of margaritas and they were delicious and decently priced. 

It is a small place but has a pretty cool decor. 

I just wish the service was a little better. After everyone ordered, the server had to make everyone repeat the order. A different server then didn't ask if we wanted anything else and then just brought out check and was pushing for us to get out. 

Besides the not so friendly service, the food was good and we overall had a good time."}
{"text":"Phenomenal tacos. Juicy, salty, flavorful - everything you could ever ask for. Reasonably priced, great service. This is the best Mexican restaurant in Madison."}
{"text":"Food was actually quite good...as was service...right up until the waiter asked me to pay...then things got very questionable.

First the waiter came to the table and \"told me\" verbally what my bill was (without actually giving me any kind of bill)...and said I could pay when I was ready.

I gave him my credit card and he came back to the table and said that it wasn't any good and didn't work. When I informed him that I had just paid for parking outside and it worked fine...he then changed his story and said he was sorry and that actually \"his machine just wasn't working\".

We offered to pay with a check...but he said no I would have to go next door and take cash out from the ATM at the bar (which charged me a $2 fee by the way). I got the money and paid him the cash and left...which I am certain he almost immediately slipped entirely in his pocket.

This put a real damper on what could have otherwise been a really nice restaurant experience. I hope the owner reads this and does a little over site...this kind of activity is really going to hurt repeat business."}
{"text":"This place is ok. It just opened a month ago so still time for improvement. I ordered a seafood chimichanga, with shrimp and crab and my boyfriend got something else that was fried...anyway, they were both overdone, like too crispy. I actually couldn't cut through the bottom of my chimi with a knife it was so hard so it went uneaten. Also, I neither saw or tasted any crab, but there was plenty of shrimp. That atmosphere was ok, nothing to complain or rave about. It is very cheap, and the margarita was good. Worth another shot because of the prices. It does not have a full bar either, the waitress told me it was only beer and margaritas."}
{"text":"My go to for tacos! Super nice staff, they remember my order, keep me well stocked with chips and drink! Everything I've has here is above average and fresh !!!"}
{"text":"First time at Francisco's Mexican Cantina. We went at about 2pm when the place was empty. We ordered a strawberry margarita pitcher and chicken nachos. The margarita was good for the price and they use real strawberries which is a nice touch. The nacho chips were a bit soggy at times but overall did their job. The inside of this restaurant is well decorated and bright with large windows. They have some decent happy hour specials posted that I would come back to try out. Our waiter was nice and quick to help us. Definitely has the \"cantina\" atmosphere. A couple metered parking spots outside as well as a parking garage across the street. Outdoor patio for summer months. I would definitely come back to try more of the menu and to get more margaritas!"}
{"text":"Simply the best Mexican food I have had in Madison. A friend and I visit Francisco's after hitting the bars, and the service is first rate. There is always great people watching here, especially with the folks pouring out of Argus and Maduro at bar time.

I have had their burritos, which were sizable portions and delicious, but my favorite dish here is the Alambre, a dish that few restaurants do well. At Francisco's, you get a sizable portion of grilled chicken with melted cheese, peppers, rice, beans, and some tortillas. It is the perfect end to a night of indulgence, and it won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Three words, folks. Carne asada fries. Yep, Francisco's has the greatest food to ever come from the marriage of American and SoCal Mexican food. Imagine french fries, covered with marinated grilled steak, oozy cheese, diced tomatoes, sour cream, and guacamole. Like nachos, only with french fries! My guy convinced Francisco to make them and last time we were there he had added them to the menu. 

Next time you're wanting a little Mexican comfort food, or you need something to eat following a night of drinking, go here. Get the carne asada fries. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I was in town for a show at the Orpheum and was looking for some late night food. We were told to go to some place nearby Francisco's but once we stumbled across this place we couldn't resist. Good food, good complimentary chips and salsa, and good prices. I thought the portions were very large for the price. I am sad that I was so one track minded and set on getting food that I didn't even noticed they served drinks. If i'm ever back in Madison, I would absolutely return to this place!"}
{"text":"I really liked *almost* everything about my most recent visit to Fancisco's!

The service was prompt, the food was prepared well, it was served up in record time, drinks were tasty... The one tiny complaint I have is that it was HOT inside the restaurant. Open up the front door and let some fresh air in, please! 

We ordered the queso dip to go with our chips and salsa. I was surprised at the size of the dish it was served in - much smaller than I expected. But it was plenty for us and we didn't need more at all. It had a really great flavor.

The main dish... Oh it was so yummy! I ordered the Fajitas Francisco's. Chicken, steak and chorizo along with fajita veggies. They were served sizzling and steaming and looked amazing. The flavor was incredible! I was impressed with the quality and quantity of this dish, and I was able to take a large amount home with me for a second meal."}
