{"text":"It is one of the best Mexican food trucks I had in awhile. I ordered the tacos before and this time a burrito, even the chips they give you with salsa and cheese is good. I go out my way to eat at this place. I once went to a party they catered it was truly amazing I alway order the chicken."}
{"text":"Had my first Pablo's experience tonight. Chicken Burrito! It was amazing! Fresh, tasty, hot, and nicely prepared. And the people are very friendly too. Thanks - way to go! I will be back soon for more!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! So savory and touched my soul. Thank you also for the speedy and friendly service."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie. I was so hungry after the bar. And I was looking for some food. And there was a taco truck. It was Pablo's truck. Not gonna lie probably the best food I've ever eaten in my whole life it was so fresh the service was amazing and everybody was incredible. I don't come to Vegas often but every time I do I will be sure to find out where they are hanging out with their tent and that rail making some fresh food. Best part of my trip. Find them"}
{"text":"Real authentic Mexican food! Staff is very nice and friendly. The carn√© asada tacos  are my favorite!"}
{"text":"My asada/pollo nachos were amazing! This truck came to my school (LVA)'s anniversary celebration. They had a distinct flavor, and the other mexican food in Vegas can't be compared to it. Highly recommend to locals or tourists in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I found Pablo's Kitchen food truck at the Food Truck Party in Centennial Center. The people working the truck were friendly and they have foil to cover your food if you are looking to pick up some grub to take home. Check their social media pages for where the truck will be next. Be prepared even if there isn't a line to wait for your order as it's prepared fresh.  Nachos ($10) - A huge pile a chips with beans, sour cream, pico de gallo, guacamole and your choice of meat, I picked steak. You can also choose red or green sauce, I went with green. I'm glad that my hubby was there to share the nachos with me because it's a lot! For $10 I was worried it was overpriced nachos, but seriously you get your monies worth. The chips tasted fresh and there was a fair amount of steak on the nachos. The beans were in need of some salt and while I saw green sauce, I couldn't taste it. These nachos were still tasty and the perfect size for sharing.   They also serve street tacos, tortas, burritos, sopes and quesadillas."}
{"text":"The best Tamales I have ever ate, not just in Vegas but ever! Pablo is a genius at Tamales. So many different flavors and the delievery service is a great bonus. Reccommend him too everyone in the greater Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"These tacos were some of the best I've had in Vegas. Definitely the best tacos I've had from a portable kitchen.  I believe they also had burritos and other things but don't miss the tacos. They fry the tortilla in a little bit of oil and you get that taquero smell. You know what I'm talking about.  Find them and eat there!"}
