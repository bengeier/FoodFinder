{"text":"I joined yelp just so I can review this amazing restaurant! I was SO impressed! By far the best gyro that I have ever had, and the kabob was divine! The staff was super friendly and made me feel welcome and wanted. The fries were thick and seasoned to perfection! This is my new favorite place!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  Have been here 3 times and NEVER disappointed.  Philly cheesesteak is the best, comes with seasoned steak fries that are just wonderful.  Portions are huge.  The lamb gyro was amazing and the sauce...terrific.  The staff is always friendly and make you feel at home.  The place is always clean and neat.  My new favorite grab and go on trips to Cal Ranch.  Yummy Yummy"}
{"text":"Pretty bummed, it's 8:38 and I've tried calling this place 3 times to get a pie ordered and they didn't pick up once. There hours say they close at 9. You'd figure for a new business they'd go a little out of there way for more business. I'll be updating my review when I've eaten there if they ever pick up the phone."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely excellent and the place was super clean. The seasoning on their fries is mouth-watering and their philly steaks make you wanna come back for more. I like how they have a variety of options for their gyros, pizzas, and kabobs. I also love that they have rice (very well-seasoned and had great texture) available on their menu. The prices are not bad and the employees were thoughtful and attentive. I would definitely visit here again!"}
{"text":"I am very picky when it comes to Philly  Cheese Steaks there are only about two or three places in Vegas that I will order one, Famous Philly Steak & Gyro just got added. The Owner/Manager, takes a lot of pride in what he serves. They add a little spice to the meat for the Philly Steak so if you like it bland you might want to have the cut back on the spices.  Don't let the location detour you from trying one of the best Cheese Steaks in Vegas. Cal-Ranch is next door so you can pick up your horse feed and enjoy a great Sandwich. We will be back to try the Gyro so stay tuned."}
{"text":"This place is the best they wigs are mind blowing they actually have more meat on them then wing stop if u haven't eat here u haven't eat at all  Everything else is a must"}
{"text":"I love this place! They are always so very nice and the food is amazing. My husband eats here for luch literally everyday of the week."}
{"text":"Found hole in wall! Next to Cal Ranch. It's half Greek half American food pizza and gyros!  gyros are smothered with homemade tazziki, fries are steak sized and fried crispy outside and creamy inside with greek seasoning. They have great wings Quezada's kabobs and haven't had pizza but everything we had was so good and low priced I don't doubt pizzas would be great!"}
{"text":"New spot in the area , been here couple times, love the foods so fresh and juice, restaurant is so clean, the stuff is so friendly, check it out, I recommend it ,promise you will love it"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Went in there the other day and let me tell you the customer service I received from a gentleman named Moe was amazing.. very professional yet down to earth funny guy. There food is amazing. I had the lamb Gyro!!!! Omg I had to order one to go just in general principal! Will be back soon to try there Pizza."}
{"text":"This place is so bomb.com and their customer service is to die for. also if you call ahead its still hot and fresh when you get home. just have too many good things to say about them try their chicken sandwiches special I'll be back!"}
{"text":"WARNING DO NOT USE YOUR CREDIT/DEBIT CARD HERE! On June 15th I went here on my lunch break and ordered 1 gyro sandwich which came out to $8.57 after tax. Days later I was checking my credit card statement and I saw that I was charged $31.36! I went to the restaurant and showed them that they over charged me. They pulled up my receipt and saw that i was correct and that the manager will call me once they figured out what happened. Couple of days later the \"manager\" called and said \"we only charged you $8.57, you'll have to call your credit card company and deal with them\". I work in retail and I know how those credit card machines work, you have to manually enter the amount yourself, and I 100% believe they intentionally over priced me hoping that I wouldn't notice. Shady location run by shady manager."}
{"text":"New spot on this side of town. Just opened. Thee most tender philly cheese steak I've ever had. Must try!!"}
{"text":"They have a location near my house and is my go to spot for cheese steaks. Now they have a place near my work and they still have they best cheese steaks in Las Vegas. I don't know why their stuff is better than Pops or Charlie's, or any other place, but it is."}
{"text":"What's with all the cheese steak spots opening up lately? Famous Philly makes good ones, but unless you go to Cal Ranch you're never going to happen upon their location- they're at the far end of a mostly deserted parking lot. Location is a little run down and most of their business is takeout.  Their cheese steaks are available in steak or chicken, and the chicken one was surprisingly decent. A regular is $8 but get two since it's just $11 and you'll have dinner for two or a huge dinner and lunch for the next day. Other menu items include burgers, gyros, chicken shawarma. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"I give this place 10 out of 10. I have not tasted any better place in town when it comes to Philly steak. Their Gyro is also amazing! This place is a must!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and very friendly atmosphere.  Staff is happy and smiling.  Food is to die for.  Incredible food.  The ohilly cheese steak and the gyro 10 stars for that and the pizza well haven't tried it but it smells and looks GOOD.  You need to at least try it"}
{"text":"My first time stopping by.   The giro sandwich was delicious (I'm amazed)service was great environment was really nice I will recommend it to everyone overall it was a cool experience and I loved the food"}
{"text":"I'm befuddled by all the 5 star reviews of this place. I've tried this place 3 times. there will not be a fourth  Went in about 3 weeks ago (against my better judgement.) The first ime I went in here, I received a dried out gyro. All the vegies were good but the meat tasted like it had been on the spit for 2 days.  The second time I ordered a gyro to go. Got home and found a plastic container full of lettuce with gyro meat piled on top.  So, I go back in about 3 weeks ago. There was a girl working the register. I said I would like a gyro with the pita and salad and fries. Oh, Okay she replied. paid $15.00 and change. Brought my order home, I had a Greek salad and fries. No gyro meat, no pita.   I'm out. Never again.  Where are all these 5 star reviews coming from?"}
{"text":"We've been waiting for a good place to move into this retail spot. The food is amazing. My team had been coming here for quite some time and never told me. The Philly is so good. The meat was tender and clean. Sauce was flavorful. Bread is amazing as well. I can't say enough. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Just ate here for the second time. There is no mistaking this is the best place for a Philly cheesesteak sandwich. I have not tasted the other food but I would recommend this place to all my friends. I normally thought Capriotti was good but this place is better. Great customer service, reasonable price, great atmosphere. Please check this place out...you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Only my second time here, he remembered me & how I like my Gyro salad!  Very friendly, clean & yummy"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Amazing food and great service!! A must if your wanting goof Gyro and pizza!!"}
{"text":"Great service the people are very friendly and the food is great.  Very good prices and have not had anything that compares would definitely recommend them to my friends and family"}
{"text":"This old shopping center needs a spot like this!  We were encouraged to try the gyro and philly so we did!!  The gyro meat was pretty thick bread was soft and veggies were fresh!!    The philly was pretty good!!  My only complaint was the gyro meat was very salty!!"}
{"text":"Great service, fast delivery. Best Philly's in town!!! Pizzas are delicious. Gyro too. Favorite family restaurant on the west side of town."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite gyro place. The gentleman who runs this location is really nice and has an excellent memory of his customers. The food is delicious and cooked right in front of you while you wait."}
{"text":"Are you freaking kidding me, there's is no way this place has 4 and half stars I got a chicken gyro plate with salad .... I got a huge salad with some chicken and freaking 2 pieces of bread on the top.... every time I go to Greek food they give so much food this was so sad and greedy. I'm so upset"}
{"text":"Food is really good but if u have a family this wouldnt be the cheapest kinda expensive, service was ok walk up window kinda rude cook made us feel rushed, and u eat outside which can get HOT in vegas but perfect late night spot"}
{"text":"I asked for kabobs the guy said you should have a gyro instead ask them for rice they said it's not fresh and the gyro meat they said is fresh in the back and they brought some frozen up to the front and start cooking it on the griddle the guy told me I'll be back before we start cooking my food it was horrible everything is a shortcut dirty dining table please hear I just asked for my money and left"}
{"text":"I dont think i have ever written a review but this place deserve it!  I have been there twice and both times the food was amazing. The first time i got the gyro and it was amazing.  Huge portion, the meat was flavorful and tender. It was delicous. The second time i got the foot long Philly and it was great!i waa going to save half for dinner but next thing i knew it was gone! The fries are great also. Bit steak cut and seasond lightly so you can tast the potato and then you get that hint of spice. After writing this im ordering delivery!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!!! Just like their other location on Cimarron/Durango ! Couldn't even finish my lunch because it was so much fun!!! We WILL BE BACK!!! Thanks guys!!!   Second time at this location! Awesome as the First Time!!!  This is my 5th time at this location 95/Jones, can get enough!! Awesome Food!!!"}
{"text":"Not quite sure how this place has such a good rating.  The location is run down and there was no a/c when my bf and I went in.  I ordered a gyro and asked the guy to add feta.  He stared at me for a while before asking me to repeat and then said he'd add cheddar.  I said no, FETA.  How do you have a gyro place and not know wtf feta cheese is?  Ay carumba.  My bf got the cheesesteak and said it was okay - nothing special."}
{"text":"This place has the best customer service and the greatest food ever!! Come try for yourself! I don't eat meat so they made me a veggie cheesesteak that was out of this world!!!"}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD....HUGE PORTIONS...LOW PRICES!  Every time I come to Vegas I make it a point to come here...a short 5 minute drive from downtown.  Food is great and the prices are a welcome relief from the tourist traps on the strip.  Eat in or take out....you won't find a better place to feed a family of 4 for under 30 dollars (less if you get their XL pizza special)."}
{"text":"Philly and gyros were beautiful and even better than the photos! Amazing food and service I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Good food, great service. And the prices are not too bad. I'm always looking for a place that has good gyro sandwiches. There are a couple good ones in town but this one is close to my house. I'm looking forward to trying some of the other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is insanely great!   Best Gyro I have ever had... hands down!  Can't wait to try the Pizza and the Philly Cheese Steaks!  The guys that work there are super cool too!  Definitely a welcomed addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I had a perfect experience with Rhiad having perfect customer service and the food being so good. So happy I stumbled into this restaurant. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Have been back here 5 times now. Turned my friend onto this place too and he loved it. The gyro with fries is a real winner that keeps us coming back.  Wanted to try the schwarma but unfortunately they don't have it all the time."}
{"text":"The Philly cheese is amazing!!! BEST Ive had in vegas. I will definitely bring my mom lol"}
{"text":"Was about to wander in to the Del Taco or McDonald's in the same strip mall, when out of the corner of my eye in bright letters I see 'Philly Steak'.  Drive there, park...go inside and 1 question, \"Are you guys also located in the NW part of the valley?\"  The second I got a \"Yes\" then found out these guys are also the owners of this location, I decided to stay!  Absolutely no frills, they make no claim to being 'authentic' Philly steak either...but damn, they make some great food!  Greasy & friendly all at the same time!  Sometimes when you're hungry, you're HUNGRY.  This may not be gourmet, it may not be organic, Hell it may not even be healthy LOL but ooooohhhhh to these guys at Famous Philly Steak & Gyro know how to make something tasty!  We ordered:  -Philly Steak with Fries & Soda ($9.99) -Gyro with Fries & Soda ($9.99)  Cooked fresh from the grill!  Philly steak had a ton of meat, mushrooms, onions & provolone cheese.  Full of flavor but not salty.  Thankfully bread was still on the fresh side, not crumbly at all.  Fries have some sort of seasoning on them that make em' delicious.  The gyro was good too, pretty sure it's a mixture of lamb/beef.  Not as good as the local Greek-owned eatery but it'll do.  The pita was warm & supple, veggies were fresh, and the sauce had some tang to it.  Good enough for a value lunch!  If you're in a pinch they do EAT24 delivery as well.  And they serve food for large parties too!  Pizzas, sandwiches and the like.    Next time I need a quick visit to Philly, I'll be getting a steak from Famous!"}
{"text":"I had this bookmarked to try, and we went here on a whim. The restaurant is open and spakling clean. My guy and I each got the gyro combo, which comes with a gyro, fries, and a soda for $10.89. The gyro was enormous. The pita was grilled and then stuffed with perfectly grilled meat. It was topped with lettuce, tomato, red onion. Topping it all off was the sauce which was fresh and delicious. The fries are thick cut, fried so they have that perfect out crispness and inner softness, then topped with zesty spice. It waa delicious!  The people there were very helpful and friendly and made the whole experience that much better. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great food!  The Philly beef is seasoned perfectly.  And you get a lot for the money.  The pizzas are awesome!   And the staff is extremely friendly and very helpful."}
{"text":"This place is so good. You have to give this place a try trust me if u like Philly cheese steak's this a place to get them.  They have two large TV's you can get fountain drinks or other cold drinks. They make everything fresh to order so it will take a few but so worth it. Plus u do not have to just get a Philly cheese steak they also have kabob's, fried chicken, gyro's, burgers, chicken wings, salad's and a kids menu plus u can get pizza. They also have eat 24. Order on line and pick up when it's ready. This place is very clean and people that work here r very nice."}
{"text":"My new favorite place!! The Philly was awesome they use ribeye and he showed us b4 cooking it. The guy who helped us was really friendly and really nice we will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Eat the philly cheese steak. There is a reason it comes first in the name. The meat is shredded rib eye steak. Mushrooms and cheese are then put on the grill and mixed in. Fries are really tasty but eat them hot Or it be really oil and gross. Seasoning is great in the fries. Customer service is like your eating at a friends house. Pizza is available too but the phillys are why you came here.  It's really small inside some military and Elvis decorations and a tv with fridge in the corner. Bathroom is clean. Area is kinda old and run down but the store is nice. Near Cal Ranch and a pet grooming store by the smoke shop. Will deliver and with grub hub $10 off"}
{"text":"Wow the food was great the stuff was very friendly I ordered a pizza that was the greatest pizza I ever had, perfect topping I enjoy my dinner. ones again thanks for your great customer-ship I will be back soon"}
{"text":"My husband and I were craving a good Philly cheesesteak and boy were we glad when we found this place. It's not super close to home but worth the drive. The meat was tender and the bread was soft. My husband got the foot long and loved it ! They even gave us fries and sodas that weren't included in the price! We will definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and the minute I walked in I was greeted with a smile and welcome from Riad and Naz . My Mom opted to get the philly steak and I got the philly chicken and we shared fries .  The meat was so tender and juicy and I was so pleased at how good this place was for being Mediterranean fusion with philly .  Plus the staff was so friendly and overall I look forward to coming back to try a gyro"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Since I found this place I honestly don't even want to eat anywhere else. I went in to try the chicken Kabob and it was excellent! Since then I have had their Lamb Gyro, and Philly Cheese Steak and they are both worthy of praise. These guys really make some delicious food so you have to check this place out."}
{"text":"This is the first time visiting here and was more then happy!! Let me start with the fact that the place was super clean and Staff was so pleasant it felt like we knew each other for years.  Now, I'm from the East Coast....and very particular with my Philly Steaks...the only word I can come up with was WOW!!! Great portions of everything and made RIGHT!! If you been missing a real Philly Steak...you've got to come here.  This is my \"Go To\" place now....great friendly staff...hot yummy food is the only way I can put it. If you haven't given them a try...do so you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Was stopping in to Cal Ranch & decided to pop in. Food was all fresh made, but we still got pretty quick. Pizza was good & so we're the burger & fries. I'll definitely stop in again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Came in today because of the great reviews. When I came in there was no one at the counter one lady came from the back and got a second I thought she was the cook the cashier and all in one person but she said oh no the cook is in the back when the cook came from the back I did not see him wash his hands and then he proceeded to make the food and touch the vegetables that I was to consume with his bare hands I explained how this made me uneasy because he was using his bare hands and I had not seen him wash his hands instead of washing his hands and offering to remake the food I was schooled on how their is no need to wear gloves because the heat will kill the germs the customer service clearly was great so I walked out of you come just make sure they wash their hands"}
{"text":"This place is really awesome! The food is fantastic and the service is it even better than the food almost. And they remember you just like on cheers.  I was here just Saturday and the owner just said my name. Tonight they start with the pizza."}
{"text":"The Philly cheese steak was amazingly good I had to order another one the very next day. The owner is so sweet and very friendly, and the restaurant was very clean I mean spotless. I'm definitely a customer for life."}
{"text":"If you looking for a pizza place, this ain't it....I ordered extra cheese and other toppings....HORRIBLE !  Save money and time and go somewhere else....I did not try their other food."}
