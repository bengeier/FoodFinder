{"text":"One of the best halal pizza places in the GTA. Had the meat lovers pizza and I must say that it was delicious. The prices are reasonable and the toppings are generous. I will be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered a few different kinds of pizza from als pizzeria and no exag√©ration when I say that it was hands down '1 of the best pizza spots I've eaten from, been telling everyone to try them out   They also have a bunch of different sandwiches, I got a jerk chicken sandwich for like 6 bucks and it was amazzzing"}
{"text":"This place is the worst restaurant I've ever eaten at. Definitely do not get food from here. They'll probably be shut down soon anyways."}
{"text":"Lovely service, the employee's are very kind and hard working. 
Ive tried the beef burger as well as the chicken and both tasted absolutely delicious - I had my beef burger with crispy bacon and it tasted just as fresh even though I had it 2 hours after I ordered it. 

Sajjad was extremely kind and helpful and food is mouth watering. 
Will definitely recommend to friends."}
{"text":"I had Al's Pili Ho burger with sauteed onions and the works, omg, fantastic burger, but be warned the Pili Ho sauce is not to be underestimated, I did, and paid for it.
Which is why I ordered a side of the sauce for my fries lol.
Employee's or mabye the owners, I'm not to sure, they we're super friendly, and helpfull, just make sure you listen to them, when they say the Pili Ho sauce is very hot, lol.
Prices are reasonable, and so are the wait times, so please support this local establishment."}
