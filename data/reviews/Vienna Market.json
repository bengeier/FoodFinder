{"text":"Nice people but u get quantity not quality  when it comes to the food..the chicken i bought was cooked just before it hit the degree of being still raw and the packaging was ghetto and sloppy....the only reason i go to this one is because its close to home the other Vienna on Warrenville center road is awesome no complaints!"}
{"text":"I ordered online and the food got here a half hour after the projected time but it wasn't a issue because the yelp app updated me through the process. The wings and the perch dinner I had were pretty good and really hit the spot. I'm glad I tried this place out. I'm stuck in a hotel for a few days and this good tasting food made my time a little better. I recommend trying this spot out."}
{"text":"My order arrived an hour late and I had to call multiple times and e-mail Eat24. I received pasta salad instead of potato salad, I did not receive any salad dressing with either of my salads. The pizza was average at best, and the corned beef was nothing to write home about. I'm giving two stars because nothing was raw or rancid."}
{"text":"I ordered 4 different meals. Everything was perfect. The corned beef sandwich was outstanding. The prices are reasonable. If I'm ever here again I'll definitely eat here."}
{"text":"This is my second time ordering from this market. The butterfly shrimp was excellent! The dipping had just enough spice. French fries were a little bit cool but all and all the food was good. I highly suggest trying the banana pudding you will not be disappointed! Great delivery service. Thank-you."}
{"text":"had everything you need to make you own corn beef sandwich.
corn beef was tender and juicy."}
{"text":"This market delivered delicious snacks to my family while we stayed at the Cleveland Clinic. We had some fried mushrooms, mozzarella sticks and tilapia. It was all delicious, and the tilapia was surprisingly good! They deliver late! I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great variety of foods.  Great wing ding specials.  Great sandwich selection.  The banana cream dessert is the best."}
{"text":"Best corned beef sandwiches and the wings are excellent next time I go I want to try a sub and fish"}
{"text":"Service is slow!
If I call in my order and told 10 minutes to pick up and I give you 20 minutes extra, then it's a problem; just tell me 30 minutes.
I hate to be standing around, if I wanted to do That I would have just walked in and ordered.
Cashier should jump over and help the cook instead of just sitting down.
Muti-task or cross train...fix this.
Corned beef was okay.
Wife's philly steak/chicken had a ton of onions and peppers; decent amount steak and chicken."}
