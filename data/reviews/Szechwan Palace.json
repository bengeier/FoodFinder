{"text":"Surprisingly authentic Sichuan cuisine in Phoenix. The staff were very friendly and accommodated our infant without any problem. The mapo doufu had great spice to it. The garlic eggplant (yuxiang qiezi) had excellent flavor and we also highly recommend the twice cooked pork (hui guo rou) and fried green beans (ganbian sijidou). The prices are certainly reasonable for the size and quality of the food. The open kitchen is also a nice touch as it gives kids something fun to stare at (flames shoot up from the dishes being cooked every few minutes). Admittedly, we only went because out POS airline put us up at the residence inn across the street after we missed a connecting flight, however, if we go back to Phoenix or if we lived in Phoenix, we'd definitely go to Szechwan Palace again."}
{"text":"The food is great. The ambiance is nice.
We went on a Saturday night and it was very crowded.
The service could have been better. Our appetizers did not come all together. In fact one of our appetizers arrived after the entrees. (We did remind the waiters a few times but still no avail). We had to wait a long time for each of our dishes. In fact that is one of the main reasons I gave this place 3 stars."}
{"text":"I'm a Chinese who lives on Szechuan food. Go to Szechuan Garden or Beijing Garden. This place is dead. The waitress/boss' wife is moody and the food is overpriced with inconsistent quality. With less money, you can be much happier if you go to Szechuan Garden."}
{"text":"Here is the deal.  You have to ask for the Chinese menu.  I am not saying this is right but if you are anything other than Chinese, they will hand you the \"American\" menu.  DO NOT GO THERE!!  Ask for the Chinese menu.  This is the BEST Chinese restaurant that I have eaten at in the states.  I lived in China for a year and this is truely authentic western China food.  I spent a couple months in Sichuan province in the west and you are getting exactly what is served there.  Try the \"yu xiang rou si\" literally translated, fish smelling small pieces of meat.  It is julienned pork in a wonderful sauce that DOES NOT  have any fish flavor or smell at all.  It is SO good.  One of my favs.  Also try the julienned potato with green pepper, wonderful!!  Ma Po Dou Fu is very traditional of the Sichuan province and known all over the country.  These guys make it right using the star anise which gives heat and a numbing quality of the mouth.  If this happens, it is authentic.  You will know what I mean when you have it.  Sichuan food is a bit oily which is authentic, a chile oil to warm them, since in the west up in the mountains that lead up to Tibet (known as the Gateway to Tibet) where the winters are very cold."}
{"text":"Amazing food. And they can make it spicy. Was recommended to me by my chinese labmate. According to him, this is the closest to authentic as it gets in Phoenix.

The service is super fast. Not a lot of wait after you order. 

The waiters are more attentive to Chinese patrons i realized. (I have been here 50 times till date).

My fav: beaf tendons, jalapeno chicken, water boiled fish. sesame rice filling balls(forgot what they are called).

A note on takeout: Their online system is great. But they close at 3pm. If you placed your order close to 3, they have utter confusion on what to do. Call and confirm with them. Also, they have this stupid policy of giving one tiny takeout box of rice even if you ordered 10 dishes. Please keep that in mind and order rice."}
{"text":"Kungpao chicken is the best iv ever had!

Food is great, they are fast, and friendly. 

I love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Good people, smiles and the food is even better. We usually have it delivered and it always arrives hot and on time."}
{"text":"The reviews for this place were so good I was really excited to place my take out order. I really like vegetables so I ordered all vegetarian items and I have to say it was just, meh.  Oh well, I guess I'm still looking for that one great place for Chinese in the SE Valley."}
{"text":"Szechwan Palace is authentic! I lived in Chongqing for a few years and love going to this place when I crave the taste of \"home\"! They also offer an american-style chinese menu too for those who are used to that! Love the sweet waitresses too."}
{"text":"Let me say that the rating was based primarily on the food, it was great.  We had the steamed pork buns, west lake beef soup, xaoshing eggplant, black bean fish filet, and hunan chili pork.  They were great, especially the steamed buns.  The portion sizes were big and the prices were very reasonable.  I would order any of them again.

What kept this from being a five star review was the service, it was bad.  When we first got there, the waitress just told us to take a seat anywhere.  There were only a few tables that had plates and silverware already on them, luckily one of them was a table of 5 for us.  After sitting there a few minutes, we just got our own menus and then waited another 5 minutes before a waitress came to get our drink order.  We placed our order for the buns and soup while still deciding on the rest.  After the drinks arrived, we placed the rest of the order and the food came out quickly.

The waitress never stopped back to ask if everything was okay (which it was), and never came back to refill our water (until checking to see if we were ready for the bill and us asking her for refills).  Also, the phone was ringing constantly and no one seemingly picked it up.  It wasn't busy at all, there were only two other tables the whole time we were there, and two waitresses working so I couldn't understand why the service was so slow.  Seems like it would be helpful to hire a host who could answer phones, seat people, and give them menus.

But we will be back because of the food, only next time, we will probably get it to go."}
{"text":"Ordered using eat 24 from yelp for delivery before 6pm, now 705, didn't get, sent 2 messages to eat24 system, says sorry for Slow response, try NO RESPONSE. I call the actual restaurant, they ask if I still want it, as they still haven't cooked it yet at 705pm an hour after I placed the order and paid for as my bank SHOWED...I said yes I am hungry is why i ordered it...it was the worst experience, and food I have ever tasted , looked like old brown rice with no veggies , and I ordered veggie fried rice, and the wontons in the soup so mushy, it was gross to even try to eat...DO NOT ORDER USING EAT24 FROM YELP FOR DELIVERY, OR EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY DO NOT ORDER FOOD FROM THIS PLACE IT WAS HORRIBLE..."}
{"text":"We witnessed \"white rice recycling\" in the kitchen by the servers - if you know what I mean. GROSS."}
{"text":"Worst services of all time. The old Chinese woman server has mental issues and argue with the guest."}
{"text":"We ordered the dumplings and the shrimp and walnut. The shrimp comes with broccoli which is perfectly cooked for my taste. The sauce for the dumplings is so really tasty."}
{"text":"For Chandler, this place is great - first time eating here - ordered the mongolian beef (for the kids), pork with bamboo and spicy family dish - they were all very tasty.  Foods on the greasy side - but it was very satisfying - great find for us - we'll go back.  We had a waiter named Tom, he provided really great service.  If you like Szechuan food, worth checking out!

Beef was heavy on the onions, but the onions were really tasty."}
{"text":"The absolute worst restaurant experience in years. Ordered several items. Pork ribs were broken bones deep fried with disgusting sweet sauce. Asked the waiter what is popular on the menu, he stuttered for awhile and said \"it depends\"...  Ordered what he recommended and it was disgusting. Yes disgusting. Finally, ordered dim sum at the beginning and 45 minutes later asked about status.  Was told that it takes 20 minutes for dim sum and watched someone run to the kitchen afterwards. Dim sum came out 10 min later with pink pork inside.  Phoenix culinary experience can benefit from a decent authentic Chinese restaurant. This restaurant is in a Chinese cultural center.  The owners should be ashamed."}
{"text":"They changed chief couple years ago, and adjusted the menu since then.

I had to say some of the items that were removed from previous menu were my \"must haves\" whenever I go. However, couple of their new stuff is totally worthy of trying. 

If you like spicy, authentic Chinese food. You will have to give this place a try.

Do keep in mind, the services can be iffy at times. Once we even waited an hour for our take outs. I guess it depends on your luck for the day."}
{"text":"Yes, hot tip you have to ask for the full menu. Second hot tip, learn to say \"hello\" in Mandarin (pronounced nee-how) and likely you won't HAVE to ask for the full menu. 

We've dined here several times, and on Sunday, not surprisingly, we were the only non-Asian customers in the place. The chef was in rare form, and as I sit here having my third round of leftovers for lunch I'm still loving my dish. I opted for the Vinegar Fish, it's pretty simple -- whitefish, wood ear mushrooms and water chestnuts prepared with a dose of spice and rice wine vinegar. I'm guessing by the waitress' excitement when I ordered, that it's a dish they're pretty proud of. It was fabulous.

Hubby ordered the Beef and Onions, which I would classify as good, but not mind-blowing. We also partook of the Gai-choy which was cooked perfectly -- just the right amount of garlic and tenderness. 

In the past I've really loved their Mapo Doufu (tofu), theirs is one of the best I've had anywhere. Next time I'm planning on having the Water-Boiled Eel. I heart eel, mmm.

Service is pretty barebones, so don't expect to be sucked-up to. It's perfunctory and efficient, the food comes up fast and they leave you alone. I can't complain about that one bit."}
{"text":"What a gem! Every time I go it is more impressive. I am a true lover of authentic Sichuan cuisine, and this is as good as i've found outside of a China (or my favorite Mala Tang in Arlington VA).
Some must tries are Spicy Pickles (cabbage); Ma Po Tofu (ask for Ja Ma), Water Boiled Lamb (also Ja Ma), baby Bok Choy & Mushrooms. Our kids always devour the Rice Noodles with beef.
Very nice servers."}
{"text":"Friendly service, my won ton and hot and sour were good. The Garlic Eggplant was a bit sweet for my taste. Great prices, generous portions and overall good food!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place has horrible customer service. They messed up my order and refused to make it right. Their food is just like their customer service - horrible. See for yourself, why don't you :)"}
{"text":"We've just discovered two new awesome dishes at Szechwan Palace -  the cumin covered lamb riblets on the Chinese menu as well as the Water Boiled Fish Filets on the regular menu.

The lamb riblets are coated with cumin and other spices, quick fried and then wok-fried with whole dried chilies, Szechwan numbing red peppercorns and caramelized onions.  This is a finger-lickin' tasty dish which you have to eat with your fingers unless you have amazing chopstick skills. 

The Water Boiled dishes are a famous Szechwan classic which I don't know why I haven't ordered until today.  The plain name is quite misleading.  It's a clear soup boiled with an insane amount of chilies, more numbing peppercorns, Napa cabbage, a little celery, fermented beans and garnished with sprigs of coriander.  You have choice of meat and we chose fish today.  The filets are coated with cornstarch and quickfried to preserve it's moisture and tenderness before adding to the stew.  This is by far the spiciest and most flavorful dish I've had here so far.  I think I'm hooked.

Let me stress that this restaurant excels at authentic Szechwan food, not American-style Chinese dishes or even Cantonese dishes.  Although the xiao long bao (Shanghainese soup buns) were surprisingly good.  I wonder if they share some dishes with the Shanghainese restaurant on the other side of Ranch Market, which was extremely quiet in contrast to Szechwan Palace which was packed with a weekday office lunch crowd."}
{"text":"Slooooow service. I dined here for Valentines day, I thought I felt myself decaying and turning into dirt.

One server covers the whole floor.

Order Takeout. I call ahead of time when I'm about 15-20 minutes away.
Around 15 bucks for two dishes and rice.

That way the food is fresh and I don't have to wait forever.

They have two menus: chinese style and American style.
I prefer the authentic chinese style though I am not Chinese.

Mapo Tofu is my fav dish here.
Its spicy and minty-cool tingly, a unique flavor I could not find anywhere else."}
{"text":"I've been travelling to Phoenix for the past 5 years.  Szechwan Palace is always on my list of restaurants to hit up during my stay.  I have often been the only Caucasian customer in the restaurant during a visit.  To me, this is a mark of a good Chinese joint.  This is not your run of the mill average Americanized Chinese food. 

You can order from the American-Chinese menu or from the more authentic Chinese menu.  I've had items from both and all were great.  My favorite combination is the General Tso's (best I've ever had) and the steamed spicy pork dumplings.  

Go there.  If you have a couple of extra minutes, drop in Super L Ranch Market, too.  They have some interesting items."}
{"text":"We've eaten here many times, one of our go-to places.  My wife and daughter are from China, and we all love everything we've had here.  From spicy lamb to hot soups, it's all good."}
{"text":"Service 1
Food 2
Overall score: 1.5

Hello owner, don't be so arrogant about your place was the 1st Szechuan restaurant in Phoenix. So what?
There are so many Szechuan restaurants now. You gotta improve the food quality and customer service or else you will get less and less customers."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great collection of authentic Chinese food. One of the unique restaurants. Price and just right and superb taste that delights your taste buds. The customer service needs to improve and I guess they need to add more staff since it is a very busy restaurant and highly crowded as well. I would rate them 5 stars otherwise."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant I have been to umpteen times and thought of reviewing just now. Hands down my favorite Chinese restaurant. Though admittedly, i havent experimented too much here, i have found what I love and stick to it. And that special list includes water boiled chicken, green beans with bacon, spinach with garlic, fish in black bean sauce. Order from the chinese menu, dont go with the cliche of kung pao chicken when all of these yummy dishes exist."}
{"text":"Spicy fish filet, water boiled anything, téng ji?o yú piàn are all very good and authentic sichuan food. Definitely recommend téng ji?o yú piàn. Its a fish dish.
You cant expect your western service in an authentic asian restaurant, its a given. But the service here is not bad.

Bottom line, this place is authentic and they cook good food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Tonight was my first time here at this new place! I remembered this place when it was Chinese gourmet! The place looks bigger now, it's more open! I literally walked I'm dumbfounded because I was expecting to walk in to the Chinese gourmet buffet lay out! The hostess/waitress was very nice and friendly! She informed me that she has only been there for a month (I would not have noticed that if she did not tell me, that's how good she was!) She was the only waitress working and she was taking care of 3 tables and got to me as soon as I walked in the door, she took my to go order and went back to her tables while waiting for my order! I also got a free glass of water while I waited! I am glad it is down the street from my house because I will continue to go there! :)"}
{"text":"Very pleased!  Authentic menu, GREAT variety!  While I did not order from the Americanized menu, I appreciated the fact that they separated the items so I could ensure I had the authentic cuisine.  I ordered the lamb in spicy black bean sauce on sizzling platter and the pea leaf with garlic sauce...yummmm!!"}
{"text":"They have American and authentic Chinese food (2 menus). The lunch menu is great and cheap. You can get an entree, rice, choice of soup, salad and an egg roll for $6-$8."}
{"text":"Very comparable to the szechwan food I've had during my many visits to Chengdu.   Authentic array of dishes, properly spicy (la/ma), good service.  I've never had a bad meal here in the 10 years I've been a patron.  I've tried 'rated' Szechwan places in San Francisco, NY and LA and this place is better.   So grateful to have a place like this in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Was not pleased with this restaurant at all.  Service was slow, there was only two other people in the restaurant so they were not busy.  They first dish came out other 2 about 5 min later. One was cold and second one was wrong.  Sent back had to wait 10 min for new dishes.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"Great food!  We had the home made dumplings in chili oil, Kung pao chicken, and a pork dish.  The dumplings were incredible, but the Kung pao was the best I have ever had.  People were waiting outside to eat here.  We will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"There are lots of great restaurants near Phoenix area, as a Chinese student, I would like to say the Szechwan palace can represent the authentic Chinese food.  I ordered Mopo Tofu, Chongqing Hotpot and Boiled beef and fish today. All dishes are really spicy and I really love it."}
{"text":"I think that this is the best Chinese restaurants in phoenix, the great taste like home. And not only delicious food, and the service is also very good."}
{"text":"Very good! I like its flavors. Although the dishes are spicy and hot, they are really delicious. I will also recommend the restaurant to my friends."}
{"text":"This is the best Szechwan style chinese food in Phoenix in my opinion. When you walk in all the specials are in chinese so it's safe to say it's authentic. The food is pretty cheap and you get a lot of it so another win there. The service is pretty good, I always feel a little awkward because english definitely isn't the first language here but don't worry it won't stop you from getting what you want, the menus are in english and chinese(not sure if it's mandarin or cantonese). Would highly recommend this place, have introduced it to a lot of friends and family both from Phoenix and from out of town."}
{"text":"Just outstanding. The water boiled fish and lamb ribs are especially recommended- just love that numbing pepper!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I am def going back. Our meal was well cooked and well seasoned and the spicy flavor was just perfect. Our waitress was very polite and attantive although a bit in rush. We had to wait a lot for our food but it was well worth it."}
{"text":"A decent addition to the chinese food options in Phoenix.  Of course, I went for my usual water-boiled fish.  It was pretty good here, though the numbing flavor that is the norm for this dish was a tad lacking.  String beans were solid.  We also had the cumin beef (usual is lamb, but we weren't feeling in a gamey mood today) and the chongqing chicken, both of which were great.  Oddly, the hot and sour soup was only slightly above average for me - what gives?!  Portion size was also a concern.  Most Szechuan places have huge portions, but we polished things off no problem and had to order a couple more plates...

Price was okay.  Service was also acceptable for me (unlike other Yelpers' experiences).

Would probably go back if I was in the area and had a hankering for Szechuan, though places in Chandler are better if you don't mind heading to the East Valley."}
{"text":"If I have a choice, I would not give any STAR at all because the SERVICE WAS EXTREMELY BAD by one of their FAT lady waitress. The FAT waiter was so... RUDE, RUDE & RUDE!  I asked her since we have 5 people if we can get a bigger table, because we were given a 4 people table, she replied with very rude attitude & without checking, she immediately say \"NO\" and walks away!When our food was served to us by another waiter, this waitress was so kind and said \"I need to move you all to a bigger table because you all won't fit in here\".  I thank her for doing this and I told her what happened earlier and she apologized for her rude co-worker.  Later when we asked the same rude fat waiter again that we will need few Togo boxes, she say \"WAIT\" and walked away by now I am already so angry at her.  We were not given the boxes after 4 minutes later!!  WTF!  She walks by our table few times and looked at us few times and don't even care!  What pissed me off even more is When my husband was at the desk paying the bill, the FAT waiter walked passed our table and mumbles \"the bill does not include tips, so please pay tips\"!  I mean. WTF!!  We read the bill and knows about it! I was getting ready to tip them $15, since she is such a rude BxxxH, I took back my $10 and leave the $5 for the other NICE WAITER.  I hope the nicer one will get it."}
{"text":"This place serves pretty spicy food, so if you are not a fan of spicy food, I'd suggest you to go somewhere else.

I've been here many many times and it is the only Chinese restaurant that I go often and crave for in the valley. The most often ordered dish on our table is the spicy chicken with bones, you might think it's crazy for the first time because almost half of the plate is cover with red chili, but that's why it tastes so good!!!!!"}
{"text":"This has to be the best food I have ever tasted. Superfast delivery. Huge portions. Free flavors. Coming from Philadelphia where there is a Chinese store on every corner, I would choose this food every time. Soooooooo good."}
{"text":"Food was tasty and service was good. Server was very attentive.  Server suggested the cream cheese won ton (I don't like cream cheese) surprisingly it was really good. The beef broccoli was good and they didn't skimp on the meat.  I would come here again."}
{"text":"when I came to Unite States, my friend recommend me to here, it is quite good actually, cuz it is Chines foods, I guess the chef is Chinese as well, but the quantity of waitress are not enough for giving  the fast service. This is the only bad impression for me with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went in and was promptly seated.  Someone came over and dumped water in our cups (with attitude) and walked away.  15 minutes later no one had come to get our order, others who sat down after us had ordered already.  Felt like maybe we were not served because we were not asian, as almost everyone else in the restaurant was.  Cant say for sure,.  The only time anyone talked to us was to ask if there were two for dinner before we sat down.  Disappointed because we were really looking forward to trying something different and authentic (menu looked good) - ended up walking out and going to tempe marketplace for dinner instead.  Apparently they didn't want to serve us."}
{"text":"\"hair on mushroom soup\" I suggest you skip this dish.  And they didn't been apologize.  4 tables in the place and they still forgot about us.  This place sucks"}
{"text":"Excellent Sichuan food. Very authentic like what you get from China. The only reason I give it 4 star is because of the service, not the best service. But while we come for the food."}
{"text":"First and Last time here, the waiter wasn't friendly or welcoming. The food was so oily, got the shrimp fried rice and lemon shrimp. I got a couple bites and got a sharp pain in my stomach. Pretty upsetting on how oily and fried the food was for no reason. Stay away if you have a sensitive stomach to super oily food."}
{"text":"Horrendously slow service at lunch with pedestrian Americanized Chinese food....  But I guess that is what sells ....  This place used to be good.  So sad...."}
{"text":"It is awesome restaurant, there are so many chinese style foods in this restaurant. for example, Kong Pao chicken, Mapo Tofu, and ect. Szechwan province is one of the best places for spicy food in China. personal opinion that this is real chinese food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Reminds me of the best Chinese food I've eaten in New York and San Francisco.  Cumin spiced lamb and the ma po tofu are special favorites of mine."}
{"text":"I ordered the general tsao's chicken. No finer has passed through these lips. Seriously."}
{"text":"Excellent. Best Wonton soup I've ever had. Unique. Everything was made with fresh ingredients, cooked to perfection. Terrific flavor."}
{"text":"Nothing great to say, nothing terrible. Lunch menu, Pepper Beef-- no better than 2 stars. Won't go again."}
{"text":"Background on Egg Soup Supper Club: We are (for the most part) white, American, Chinese speakers. The majority of us are ASU students. We are all between the ages of 20 and 30 years old. We meet once a week at a different Chinese restaurant around the Tempe/Chandler area for Chinese food. 
__________________________________________________­_____________

General thoughts: 

We went to Szechwan Palace right in the middle of the government shutdown, so we were kind of limited in our choices of dishes. We usually get a shrimp dish of some kind, and base a large portion of our comparison review around that, but what with lack of import control, we all agreed that we didn't want salmonella. 

Food: We got the water boiled fish ( ????). It was pretty dang good. The sauce was just spicy enough to be delicious, but not so spicy to be unedible (except that's not a word. Whatever). There was a lot of it. I don't think we finished it all. 

We wanted to order dry beef pot (? ????), but they didn't have it. One of our members said that they have it at the Chandler location, but not at this one. Instead, they recommended cumin beef (????). It was decent. The cumin flavor was very strong. However, it was not my favorite thing I've ever had. 

We always order eggplant (????). This place had some very excellent eggplant for us. We were not disappointed. The pieces were kind of ginormous, but the flavor was good, and they were definitely not cooked to the point of gooey. They were delightfully firm--almost like a party in my mouth. 

Other dishes we ordered were garlic spinach (????). It was good. The Chinese people at the next table over asked what it was so they could order some. The dragon rolls (? I have no idea. ??????) were to die for. They were big and juicy and probably one of my favorite foods of the night. The garlic green beans (?????) were to die for, and very large in portion. Actually, all the portions are large. I think we were all stuffed at the end, and still had some left over. 

All in all, it was pretty dang good food. The service, however, was lacking. We saw our guy maybe three times. We had to flag him down to order, and he always seemed distracted when we were talking to him. Meanwhile, he was chatting it up with all the other ethnic Chinese people. At the end, he gave us the wrong check, but was gone within seconds, so we had to flag down someone else to give us the right one. She was not impressed with him either. This is the reason that they got three stars instead of four.

{"text":"Tried both the Dan Dan Mian at the Chandler location (good portion, tasted decent to good)) and the Sichuan Cold Noodles (liang mian) at the Phoenix location (small portion and not much flavor).  If you are from an area with abundant Sichuan choices (L.A.) this may disappoint a bit.  But for Phoenix it's a good thing to have around when the Sichuan cravings hit."}
{"text":"In short: I got a run of the mill Chinese meal here, but I didn't know to ask for the \"real\" menu. Service was excellent for as busy as they were.

So I went to the Chinese Cultural center on Sunday, Chinese New Year, looking for Chinese culture. I found a street fair with such cultural gems as a booth for Wells Fargo loans, and one selling \"crazy Chinese hats.\" I wanted authentic food, and the booths selling egg rolls and stuff from the market buffet were pretty much the opposite of what I was there for. So my date for the event and I decided to try one of the Chinese restaurants at the center, and I chose Szechwan Palace because I was in the mood for something spicy.

The place was packed, which was to be expected. Since a good portion of the conversation I heard taking place was in Chinese, I was hopeful that that this would be an experience similar to what I'd get in Seattle's international district. I knew that wouldn't be the case when I saw the menu, which was basically the same menu you'll find in any americanized Chinese restaurant.

So we just ordered the Szechwan dinner for two. Hot & sour soup, crab rangoons, fried rice, general tso's chicken, szechwan shrimp, and a rice based desert that I forget the name of. I thought all the dishes were decent, but nothing had the spice I expect from Szechwan cooking.

After consulting Yelp, I know now there is a \"real\" Chinese menu here. That explains why this place could be so popular with native speakers. I wish I had known. This review reflects the disappointing experience I had with the menu I was presented with."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Chinese food. My girlfriend is from wuhan China and she always brings me here when she misses home. Great food but don't expect the best service. But the prices are good and once they bring you the food you won't care about the service. It's just authentic and well prepared. Try the cold dishes for an appetizer you won't find anything like them anywhere else. They are fabulous!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, nice authentic spicy chinese food.  
As good as you can get here in Arizona;  it aint L.A or San Fran, but does a good job to satisfy the craving for real chinese.
 
Of all the Cofco asian restaurants, this is one of the more presentable ones to bring business clients or a new date, if ambiance is key to scoring positive brownie points.    
 
For some bizarre reason, on the weekends, it is filled with asian-women/white guy couples,    which strikes me as hilarious.  If it wasn't for this,  I would eat there multiple times a week. 
Asian woman orders from real chinese menu;  her white guy orders from chow mein menu.
 
Side note:  Get a grip; asian women check each other out, and  usually not in a nice way--like in a sizing you up-comparing you to herself way--so I usually end up losing my appetite when I catch one of them staring at me (and my man) and whispering to her white guy or her girlfriends about me;  yah, I understand the shit you say about me, asian girls, because I speak your language too, hello!
 
So I compensate for my chinese food cravings by quick carry out.  Works like a charm every time.  I'm happy, my own Cracker is happy.  Owner gets lots of business and is happy. 
 
We all win."}
{"text":"Just had their water boiled spicy beef and traditional fried rice. Loved them both! The beef was tender and had just the right amount of spice. The rice was fresh and not greasy like most Chinese food joints. I also had the the spring rolls and they were just ok. I didn't give them the full 5 stars because although the service was fast, they weren't as attentive as i would have liked them to be. Overall the food was superb!"}
{"text":"That is a great place to order some real Si Chuan food. I with my friends went to there lunch time, we all wants to try the hot pot next time. Good place to eat Chinese food."}
{"text":"What a bummer. We read the reviews before going to this place with full intention of ordering off the black menu... Unfortunately we are boring white people who were too scared of the unknown dishes so we ordered orange chicken, mongolian beef, general tsao's chicken, crab wontons, beef chow mein, sweet and sour soup, and egg rolls. The soup was great, warm, spicy, big chunks of tofu and pork. Everything else was mediocre at best. The entrees were nothing more than goopy cornstarch sauce with little to-no flavor, the meats and vegetables in everything seemed to be fresh and of good quality but were coated in batter and perhaps just barely fried- leaving them covered in soggy mush that has absorbed the goopy flavorless sauces. Nothing other than the soup was spicy, not even a hint of heat- never-mind the little pepper next to the items on the menu indicating the heat level. It was a giant waste of money and if we hadn't ordered take-out we definitely would have gotten our money back. We've now got a fridge full of left-overs that we're dreading eating. I wouldn't recommend this place at all. I imagine the black menu is tastier, but it's ridiculous to have two menus with food of completely different quality levels rather than levels of authenticity. 

Moral of the story: Gross. Flavorless. A gigantic waste of time and money. We're so disappointed."}
{"text":"My first visit today. I'm from SF and miss my local Chinese food. The food here was was really good! I ordered 2 lunches and my friend did too, and we got to sample everything. It was tasty, and I will come back. Lunch was very inexpensive and the prices for dinner look very reasonable also. It's real Chinese food! 
Real delicious Chinese food!"}
{"text":"I had lunch there today pretty typical menu choice went with the shrimp & scallops with veggies. the spring roll and rice were tasteless and cold. two scallops  on the plate asked to prepare mild spice and it had no spice. asked about the two scallops and the lady said its the lunch portion. see ya wont be back ever again!!"}
{"text":"The water-boiled fish is transcendent. I love the bok choy and black mushroom. Sadly I enjoy these so much I haven't tried much else on the menu. The ambiance is a bit sterile. But the food is delightfully Szechwan."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for work and convinced my local colleagues to come to this restaurant. In summary, for Sichuanese food, this place is top notch. We have a handful of good Sichuanese places in the San Francsico area, and this place would fit right in.

One tip: Order from the \"Chinese menu\". If you're looking at the menu that has \"Mongolian Beef\" or Egg Foo Yung, that's the wrong menu. 

I can only comment on the dishes I ordered from the one outing, but they all shined:

-Water Boiled Fish (Shui Zhu Yu). There are different versions with beef, pork, or lamb, but the cooking preparation is the same. Spicy with red chili peppers and a healthy dose of Sichuan peppercorns which give a pleasant numbing/tingling sensation to the spice.

-Cumin Lamb: Healthy dose of cumin. Good rendition.

-Chongqing Spicy Chicken (Chongqing lazi ji): Ask for \"with  bones\". The meat comes from the chicken wing and drumette portion.  Comes covered with red chili peppers, but push those aside and just chowdown on the chicken wings and spit out the bones.

-Green beans (gan bian si ji dou). A good rendition with some pungent garlic. 

big thumbs up and I'll stop by here again when I'm in the area for work."}
{"text":"Very authentic tasting hot pot dish on Chinese menu. I wasn't expecting it to be very good, but it is extremely good. I'd recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"It's not good, it's fantastic! I recommend getting C74 Squid with Pickled Chili on the menu, it has a good burn to it. The Spring Rolls and Crab Puffs are good as well. They served their food family style, so there is enough for 2-3 people. The price and service is good too."}
{"text":"The food is pretty pretty good! I'm a Chinese and I only find some traditional restaurant to eat. This restaurant is the only one I go each week! The service is excellent. Sometime I don't have enough time to eat here and I choose to get the food delivered, the delivery guy is so kind and I can get my hot food in a short time! 

Recommend all u guys come to eat and u must love it!!!!!!!! Also for my American friends, I took them to come here and they recommended orange chicken and hot sour soup, egg soup so much! The walnut shrimp and crab puff is soooo excellent for u guys! I tried all Chinese restaurant in both Phoenix, page, flagstaff,and Tucson. Just try this best Chinese cuisine in Arizona !!!
Delivery is fast."}
{"text":"Just arrived from PHX airport and I found a Chinese restaurant so I be here immediately. As a Chinese I have to say they make really good Chinese food. Recommend and I will be here tomorrow to try something new."}
{"text":"Asked my friend where he wanted to go for his Birthday and this is where he choose.
I had never been here before,so I was excited to try it out.
Lots of parking here at the Chinese cultural Center.
Nice looking place inside and out. 
The Cultural Center is a huge beautiful building. Something that Phoenix really needs. But, it looks as if there is quite a few empty business spots here.

We were seated right away,but it did take a while to get our tea. Very quickly though they brought our soup. It was hot and Sour and was very good.
The lunch specials are huge plates and you can choose white rice or Brown. No substitutions on anything ,which is the norm.
They dropped off the check and you pay it at the front counter. But 3 people were up there and they were all yelling in Chinese at each other about something.
Four patrons were waiting to check out in a line and the were not helping anyone. It was a bit crazy. But, luckily we were not in a hurry.
Nice place but, I think I like Mui's in Tempe better. My kung pao was not that spicy for some reason.
Still worth a try.Close to the Airport. It is a great location."}
{"text":"I had a weirdest serviced at Chines restaurant today we've never been there before and no plan to going back again because their food and service suck A*%! What happened was this waiter I asked him what's their special of the day. He said \"we don't have a special of the day but we have a menu that's posted by entry way. I was like I think he didn't understand me because he keep changing his recommendation and his wasn't sure.. So after I ordered my food my husband asked him if they're serving Hot and Sour Soup.. I can't believe it what he responds and told us and asked \"do you prefer Chines way or American way\"? then he add up and suggested \"Chinese way are more Very good than American way because it's \"SHIT\" I was so shocked and I can't stop laughing underneath the table!! Hahaha! I don't think they don't like serving American people there.. So, no plan to go back their again!!! What weird place!!"}
{"text":"Clean, gorgeous place! Fantastic wait staff, AMAZING, AUTHENTIC CUISINE! So impressed! Go, go, go!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese food I ever had here in Phoenix. We ordered shrimp crispy, beef Szechuan and wanton soup. I can't believe the food here is so great. Definite I'll be back here before flying back to LA and after the super bowl games"}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised with our lunch.  They made a dish for me off-menu, very good Beef Chow Fun with Black Bean Sauce. We had Orange Chicken and crab puffs, both were good too.  I was surprised how empty they were as the food was better than the buffet that previously occupied this space"}
{"text":"I am a real Chinese, so this flavor is all I'm being looking for in Glendale...we ordered several \"signature\" dishes for schzuan style on the menu, and there are definitely ups and downs here:

The cold dishes taste really good. We ordered beef tripes, and they're delicious.

We also tried the kidney, love it! The chicken in hot wok, love it! The steamed whole tilapia, you HAVE TO try it!!! Super delicious!!!

The water-boiled series are a little bit turned down for me. The taste is weird and there should be way more vegetables in the soup. 

In general, pretty good place to have some schzhuan style food."}
{"text":"First time visit, but had horrible experience. This review is for there service. Whire we were eating, the table beside ou left. So, one person with cart came to clean the table. Even though his basket was full he put soup ball on the basket and it slipped. The soup was all over my sister's leg, foot, shoes and her skirt. NO ONE CAME!!! The person who was cleaning the table was looking at us and gave tissues. No apologies. We asked for the wet towel but some other server gave us dry towel and left. My sister has to go to bathroom to clean her self. When she was out of bathroom I thought someone will come and reserved the issue. NO ONE CAME!! We decide to leave so we called the server and tell him we are living. He was trying to make us pay for the food. I told him I will not pay after all those things are happened. He says \"I dont know what happened.. give me a second\" (This person was who gave us dry towels). He brings other lady, and she looked confused. I told her what happen, she was trying to make excuses. I told her we are living and she says ok. And turned around and goes to the other table. We are so frustrated that there was no apologies, they were treating us like we spilled that soup, and it was no big deal for them."}
{"text":"Have been for lunch during the week several times and it was worth putting up with the consistently rude and horrible service for the quick and good and cheap food.     Went today for early Sunday dinner and will not go back.   Service was beyond horrible and food just OK at best.   Also too expensive for what you get.    I don't need to spend thirty dollars to be treated.rude."}
{"text":"This is my second visit here both trips were equally great. Last night I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken (American version cause I wanted white meat) and it was really good. One thing I liked is they didn't skimp on the chicken like many other places do. 
Tonight I got the celery and peanuts appetizer. I had never seen that on any menu and I do like both so I figured WTH. I also ordered the spicy fried filet of fish. I asked the waiter if it was \"thai hot\" and he said it's very spicy. I'm trying to drop a few pounds so I thought if it's too hot it will help me control my portion.  
The celery and peanuts are stir fried with what I think is garlic pit and a tad of salt. I was surprised at how tasty it was and I finished the entire bowl. I waited until my fish arrived and used it as an accompaniment for the fried fish. Now I know the pic makes this fish look hotter that he'll but as long as you're not an idiot and eat the red peppers you will be fine. If you stick to eating the fish and onions I would say it's a 2 out of 10 on the heat scale. Down a few peppers by mistake and well....You can respond and tell me. I know better! 
The service was really good except it took a while to get the check. It was packed tonight and only 2 people waiting tables so I won't ding them for it this time. 
Give it a try and order off the diner menu #2."}
{"text":"I have given this place a chance multiple times, this time they forgot my order for the second time after waiting over an hour. They told me I have to come down to the restaurant to pick up my order! I am done with this place and it's shitty service, good bye!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were hungry after shopping next door at the market. It was around lunchtime and noticed that Szechwan had some great prices for a long menu of choices. We went in and were seated right away. Our waitress was very friendly and took great care of us! 

I ordered the Szechwan beef and my friend got a Kung Pao Chicken. The food came out within 10 minutes so I was pleased, although there were only about 6 other customers eating. I found the food to be good, but similar to other Szechwan places I've tried in the past. 

Will definitely come back if I'm in the area shopping at the Asian market."}
{"text":"Where do I even start with this place. Went here for my bf's graduation lunch and it was thw worst mistake. The food was not even ok. Felt tasted like it had been sitting out for a while. We never got our drinks refilled nor did anyone come over to our table to ask and see if we needed anything. When it comes to dining my bf and I are very simple people and will tip very well. Once it was time to paybwe saw the cashier giving another customer and ASU discount since she had their ASU ID. Once we asked about it, she said they didnt offer it.  wtf lol. So did we not get a discount because because he was black and I was mexican or was it whomever you choose? Wish I could give this place zero stars but can't so my advice is just don't go eat there it is gross and disgusting."}
{"text":"Since moving to the valley 5 years ago I've been struggling to find a really good Chinese restaurant. Especially one that sells real Chinese food.  I ordered the dan dan noodles and the pork in sweet been sauce. Both were really good. I didn't know what to expect with either dish but was pleasantly surprised with both. The noodles are spicy but not so much that the other flavors of the dish are hidden. And the sauce used on the pork was very simple but worked well with the perfectly cooked pork. 

They have a large menu full of all your American Chinese favorites as well as a lot of traditional foods. The traditional menu seems to focus on foods from Sichuan province but there are lots of recipes from other regions as well, so even if you don't like spicy food, it's worth checking out the Chinese menu!"}
{"text":"I am originally from Szechwan and I'm glad that they do offer quite authentic Szechwan dishes (at least compared to other Chinese restaurants in the valley). The spiciness and the seasoning are just right. The place is clean and the servers are okay. Try not to order from the Americanizd Chinese food menu and try some authentic Chinese food! You will be surprised."}
{"text":"Good food, decent priced lunch menu.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Chinese spicy dishes!! And at reasonable prices. I stayed in that area for only one day and wanted authentic Chinese cuisine. This was a must stop by restaurant. If I visit here again I will come back."}
{"text":"I keep going back  The food is always consistently good.  Worth a trip from anwhere in the Valley!"}
{"text":"Very good and authentic Chinese food... I have worked in a Chinese restaurant, and been to China. It is always a good indicator when it is Chinese owned & operated, and when the customers are mostly Chinese."}
{"text":"Delicious food, cheap prices. Would have loved to see the full menu, instead of been limited to the lunch selection."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for dinner for fathers day. We have been looking for some authentic chinese food. When we first walked in place was clean empty but looked nice. The menu has two menus one authentic and other american chinese. We ordered from the authentic side. We started with steamed buns with pork, dan dan noddles (great), pork dumplings in chili oil. For our meal we got the shrimp hot pot, lamb with cumin and chicken fried rice. The lamb was delicious my fave. Every thing was great. Service was awesome never had a empty cup checked on us when needed not pushed. The bill was 52 which was great for everything we got we will be going back."}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant a low rating, because I was very disappointed with the food and service. I ordered the tea rose smoke duck, no flavor. My husband ordered kung poa chicken, no flavor & my friend order curry chicken, very bland. We were told, brown rise was not a dinner option. We were only able to have white rice. Im still searching for a good, no a great Chinese Restaurant in the greater Phoenix metro area. Please follow up if you've experienced a great one. As for Szechuan Palace, I'll pass."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE service!!!!! And dont even try to change anything because they dont understand and will not try to. Cant believe what horrible service they provide!"}
{"text":"Reading the other reviews here makes me think I must have landed in a parallel universe the night we ate here. 

OK, so I'm a Bay Area native and love Sichuan food; I'm white and my girlfriend is Asian. We walk in the door, are seated, and handed the simple menu.  NOTHING of interest on the menu.  We decided on two very basic dishes (General Chou's Chicken and a Sichuan Prawm dish).  The Chicken was atrocious - dry, old-tasting, and nothing but a pile of chicken - no vegetables, no spice, nothing. The shrimp dish was marginally better, but nothing to write home about. 

Meanwhile, everyone at other tables seemed to be ordering stuff that we didn't see on the menu ... \"maybe there's a Chinese menu we didn't see\" we said to each other ... 

On our way out, we saw the 'Chinese' menu ... full of the stuff we were looking for - \"pigs stomach with jalapeno\", etc .  So - I'm willing to believe they have good food, but - WHY oh WHY have a separate 'whites' menu? AND - when a white guy walks in with an Asian lady, WHY not give them the 'Asian' menu?  The 1 star accurately reflects the food we ate, and also applies to the waiter who did not think to offer us the appropriate menus. 

We'll probably head back to Chandler for our next Chinese food experience."}
{"text":"If you want authentic Chinese food, learn mandarin and come to Szechwan Palace.  If you are not Chinese you will be the minority. But that is ok because they make you feel welcome enough and the food is outstanding. Cost is very reasonable and their is quite a variety."}
{"text":"Ummm.... I wanted to come here while I was in town.  I was missing food from another restaurant that used to exist up the street from this place and is somehow associated with the same owner, so I was hopeful.  The menu is split into two sides, the front is Chinese food, the back is Americanized Chinese food.  I really wanted duck, and there were two options on the menu.  The first one was braised and I believe it was what I was looking for but it listed a sauce I wasn't familiar with, or maybe I've eaten it and just didn't know what it was called, so I asked our server and he went to the manager to try and figure out how to explain it.  I guess it was hard to explain to Americans and he felt most American palates did not appreciate the flavor.  He suggested we get the tea smoked duck instead, and we listened.  I'd been wanting hot and sour soup and I missed it so we ordered it, and we got Mongolian beef cause it was listed as spicy, and it's usually safe.  

The hot and sour soup came out first, and it was bland.  How is this bland? I was confused, I think I was served the white people version at a Chinese restaurant for the first time in my life because of my lack of accent and my not Asian looking buddies.  I understand trying to play it safe and not wanting to serve food your patrons will not be able to handle, but there was no flavor.  The tea smoked duck came out and it was smoky, and alright.  The skin didn't have that slight crunch to it, it was a little dry.  I regret listening to the server and ordering this instead of that other duck, I imagine if I'd stuck to my original plan I probably would have gotten real hot and sour soup instead of getting the white people hot and sour soup.  The Mongolian beef came out last and I was so sad.  If you were to Google pictures of Mongolian beef.. it didn't look like that.   But I have to be fair and remember this is a Szechuan style place, it's in the name.  I guess I didn't realize I should have been expecting something different from what I usually expect an that's on me. It wasn't even spicy.  I get the guy was trying to be helpful to Americans and was unknowingly misleading, or grouped everyone together without realizing despite our roots, we all have different tastes and some of us are actually able to appreciate the flavors they're hiding... they might be hiding.  I'm not even sure.  My friends joked next time I should go in alone and order to go so we get the \"real stuff\" while they wait in the car, then we can go home and eat while watching Netflix.  I'm not going back."}
{"text":"This place has an obvious identity crisis. 

They ARE an authentic Szechuan Chinese restaurant BUT have to serve Americanized Chinese food on the side. They make it awkwardly obvious they are not proud of that separating the menu between \"Authentic\" and \"Americanized\". It's like the 1970s and 80s all over again! I guess Phoenix doesn't have enough customers to appreciate Szechuan cuisine at it's finest. 

Food: 
Me: Mapo tofu 
Lady: American or Chinese style? 
Me: .....?? *In my head* I'm freakin Chinese give me the Chinese one! 

Mapo Tofu - I should have order the American one...what she was really asking is Cantonese or Szechuan. Cantonese is sweeter with a semi thick sauce. Szechuan version is soaked in hot oil which did not set well for my stomach and it is the knumbing version which makes you feel like crap if you're not use to it. 

Sizzling rice soup - MSG soup with snow peas, baby corn, chicken and shrimp. Ok ok I should expect a dish like this to such, but my American side was craving this...don't judge me! 

Service: 
Limited English staff. Chinese attitude. I Love it! But not after a long day at work. 

Environment: 
It actually looks pretty nice in here. About 60% of their patrons are actually Chinese with limited English. 

Price: 
Wasn't expensive for the type of food served. Americanized menu is much cheaper. 

I would give this place another shot if I lived in the area.

Food: 2
Service: 2

{"text":"This place is like family. One of the rare Szechwan styled restaurants in the valley. If you have never had this style you have to try it. Really fresh."}
{"text":"A friend and I wanted to indulge in some chinese food and we decided on this place. We have never been here so we were definitely interested to see what they had to offer compared to our other favorite spots. I liked the the interior and I'm glad we came early for the lunch rush because we were seated right away.

My friend ordered the Salt & Pepper Pork ribs and they were nothing special. Overly coated with sauce and you couldn't tell what was meat/bone. The house fried was exceptionally good.

I had ordered \"beef with onions\" which was exactly like Mongolian beef. Nothing spectacular about it but it was good. Now the steamed pork dumplings on the other hand were exceptional! So delicate and so delicious and so hot that it melts in your mouth! Not really but it was the best part of my meal.

I'd like to come again and try some other foods and maybe change my mind on the rating. Overall, great experience and come for the dumplings!"}
{"text":"Water boil beef and boneless chonquin chicken to die for. Thank you for not dumbing down the flavor for westerners. Over a dozen trips and not a single bad dish."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Food was very good, reasonably priced, and service was great. You can tell when food is fresh and everything from the sauces to the breading on the chicken was light and fresh tasting. Will definitely return when I'm in town."}
{"text":"So I'm fiending for chinese again... thus I placed myself once again in the hands of fellow  yelpers and found Szechuan Palace.  Given the reviews, it seemed like the place had an authentic menu and a bananified menu (for all you orange chicken lovers).  Me being on the quest to satisfy the yellow in me, I was curious as to how traditionally and culturally accurate the authentic menu was.  

On a side note, restaurant.com has a deal for them right now...  Buy a $10 gift certificate for ($3?), minimum purchase of $20 required.

Gift certificate in hand, I show up at the doors of Szechuan Palace at 10:59AM.
 
*cricket cricket*

The restaurant was not open but no worries, one minute couldn't hurt, right?

Wrong, I waited a whopping 12 minutes before a dude comes cruising into the parking spot next to me, gives me the once over, and pulls out the keys to the front door of the restaurant, walking in without acknowledging me.

That's... nice...  At this point in time, the OPEN sign still had not been turned on, so I hesitantly followed after him into the restaurant.  A little after I started my awkward dance at the entrance, two Chinese people carrying grocery bags come rushing in and tell me to sit wherever I liked.

So I plopped down and began to lament why I accepted terrible service practices at Chinese places but cannot for the life of me accept it elsewhere...

My waitress brought me a lunch special menu that indeed had authentic Szechuan cuisine on one side, and then your average mock Panda Express food on the other.  After presenting my gift certificate though, she immediately whips the menu out of my hand, informing me that I could not use the gift certificate with the lunch specials.

No problem, lady... nothing on the lunch special was desirable to my refined Asian palate anyways.  Bring me the expensive crap.

She presents me with the dinner menu and sure enough that too was split exactly in half... First half was the authentic, second half Panda Panda.  I start perusing and order.  She gives me an incredulous look like you little asian girl going to eat all that?  Yes, Ma'am.  I didn't drive all the way from San Tan Valley to go home hungry.

Here's the breakdown:

Fu Qi Fei Pian
Dan Dan Mian
Boiling Two Items (Fish and Pig Intestines)

Fu Qi Fei Pian - 4/5
Okay, this was just the right amount of spicy goodness.  Truly an authentic dish.  For those of you who don't know what this is, it's a cold dish traditional to Szechuan province: thin sliced braised beef chilled with celery, chili oil, peanuts... delish.  My only complaint is that I've had better in California and it seemed like it might've been the last of its batch with several small pieces of meat and way too many peanuts.  For $7.95, I may get it again only when I'm direly in crave mode for it.  Usually for the portion I received, I can get it for a mere $5, so definitely priced for AZ consumption.

Dan Dan Mian - 4/5
So seeing a lot of rave reviews about this dish, I thought... oh it's been awhile since I had a legit Dan Dan Mian...  and for $3.50 a bowl... it didn't seem like it could go wrong.  Basically what it came out to being was a soupless noodle dish with a spicy minced pork topping and spinach.  Good flavor, nice spiciness level, and the boiled spinach tossed in was plentiful.  But, I think that the noodles were the kill factor here, with it tasting store bought and a little too al dente... plus the minced pork mixture ratio with noodles was a little off... leaving me thinking... so that's why it's so cheap.  I probably would not get this dish again, unless that was the only thing I could afford here.

Boiling Two Items (Fish and Pig Intestines) - 5/5
OMG.  Yelpers, you were right... get this dish pronto.  Of course, they have different options... so for those of you going ewwwww.... chitterlings really? Don't judge... I'm Taiwanese... that crap is a staple in our diet.  Anyways, this dish is authentic to the max.  It's basically your choice of protein boiled in a garlic chili oil mixture with napa cabbage.  Effing delicious.  I probably would not get the chitterlings again next time because it needed to be tender soft and it was more chewy then anything else.  But the fish... delicious.  It's pieces of boneless fish that are meltingly soft to the palate and seasoned from the \"boil\" so good, you would be surprised you're eating fish.  So get it get it get it.  This is worth every penny of that $10.95 I spent.  Portion is large enough to eat for 3-4.  I'd make the drive out here again just for this dish.  Enough said.

Overall, the authentic menu is that truly authentic and I'm excited to try some of the more common Szechuan fare I'm used to dining in LA.  If you are an adventurous eater and tired of Orange Chicken or Kung Pao Chicken or General Tso Chicken, indulge in some truly delicious Chinese cuisine and pick some items off the traditional menu.  It won't disappoint.

{"text":"Food is good. Service is horrible esp when you come here during busy lunch hour. The waitress are very busy. They don't like to make eye contacts with you. We sat for 40 min for our food to arrive.  We will go back for the food but definitely not during lunch time."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the reviews for this place. The service is severely lacking. I'm not sure why they're so forgetful and slow here, but they are.  The food is ok, but nothing special. A little underwhelming, really. Combined with the bad service, I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"I have had the food from here before and it was good enough to order again. This time only two out of four of my items taste good enough to eat:( there was only two pieces of shrimp in my Chow mn!?!?  No soy sauce, one fork for w order of three entees and a appetizer and only ONE small white rice to again an order of THREE large entrees ! For $40 only the appetizers and noodles were eaten :(  disappointed and prob won't order again.    
The best part of ordering from here today was when my PUPPY ran out side and didn't even touch the delivery MAN and he screamed and ran around my vehicles letting out a high pitched squeal and saying some thing like \"oh no oh no\" again this is a small PUPPY :)"}
{"text":"This is the first restaurant that I have seen that is open until exactly 9:15pm. It is an odd closing time and maybe they were in a rush at 8:45pm packing my to-go order because my two spring rolls at $2 were left out. The dipping sauce for those spring rolls were in there and that ended up getting dumped on the white rice that was included with my noodle dish which is also unusual. So, I tried rice noodles with beef, but rice noodles in this joint are not Singapore style (which I wanted), but instead were chow fun style whic is like american egg noodles basically. The english spoken by the front counter owner was not perfect and she also seemed in a rush to make that crazy 9:15 time a reality. Ok, so the noodles and the onions and scallions in the dish tasted like any other place, but the nasty, unedible and in some pieces uncooked (9:15?) pieces of beef really earned this place its one star. I order beef like once in three years in Chinese places knowing that every place usually sucks and this was no exception. The owner could have mentioned that i could have gotten all veggies, but she didn't when I questioned her and I didn't figure out on the long menu that i could have gotten the same dish for $7.95 with no disgusting beef on the American side of the menu instead of paying a buck more. There must be an asian TV show that starts at 9:30pm or something because I doubt you will ever see a 9:15pm closing time ever again. I think the show is called \"food no Good\""}
{"text":"This is one of the main restaurants at the COFCO center located next to the Asian supermarket. We live down the street and decided to try this place. We really like the eggplant and pork and string bean dishes. It is Szechuan food so they have a decent variety of spice if you like the tongue numbing spice. It is pretty authentic and we come here from time to time. It's best for sharing so order a few plates and grab some friends."}
{"text":"First I would like to say to everyone that complains about the service is to please stop bitching about it. Yea most of you are stuck in American ways and things should be set in a certain way everywhere. This is a AUTHENTIC Chinese food restaurant, it's not they are being rude or don't want to come back every 2 mins to make sure you are ok it's because there is literally 2-3 waitress's working at a time. I've been here probably 50-60 times since its my fiancé favorite Chinese place in phx, and shes from china and hates Americanized Chinese food, but every time I've been here when it's slow or packed I only see 2-3 waitress's and sometimes a helper here and there. So just be patient. 

The food is worth the wait if you order correctly. I've had a few americanized dishes and they were ok and my fiancé was like you need to order for, the authentic menu and wow I was surprised how Chinese food was suppose to taste like. Alot of the dishes have this weird tingly numbing feeling which is weird at first but you get used to it. 

A few things I can remember you should get that we always order, I don't know the Chinese names but I'll try to explain the best I can. 

1. Husband and wife dish. It's a app and seved cold. About 7 bucks
2. Boiled fish in spicy sauce. 
3. Spicy chicken wings but these are cut in half deep fried then cooked in peppers and spices. My favorite 
4. Cucumber dish served cold and has tingly stuff on it. Like 4-5 bucks
5. Pork intestines cooked like the chicken wings above. I know that sounds gross but they taste really good.
6. Beef chow fun, yea this is a americanized dish but it's the best beef chow fun I've had anywhere. 

There is a few more but I'm drawing a blank. Anyways this is authentic Sichuan food so explore different dishes because they are GOOD!"}
{"text":"This is the best Szechwan restaurant I've ever eaten at.

In particular, their shui zhu yu and fu-chi fei pien were really, really good. 

I make it a point to come here once or twice any time I'm in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I am new to Chandler and have been trying to find a place that has good Chinese food, unfortunately Szechwan Palace is not that place.  I got Walnut Shrimp which was over cooked and dry, spring rolls that seemed like they had been under heat lights for a while, fried calamari that left a funny taste in my mouth and house chow mein that was over cooked.  The only dish that I enjoyed was the happy family.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I won't repeat what has already been said but there has been some myths that need clarifying

1. Both the Chinese and Americanized menus are written in English including the description of the dishes. Also, you can ask the waiter to explain the specials. You don't have to speak Chinese or be Chinese to know the specials. After dining here, I realize some people want to sound unique or VIP but trust me, you don't have to be Chinese to taste all the dishes. That is B.S.

2. The Yelp photos donated by members make the dishes appear larger than they are. Most of the sauteed dishes like the Kung Pao chicken and Egglant were not big but then some like the Water Boil chicken was rather big.

3. The food is spicy but it isn't hot. If I had to compare it to a Thai restaurant, the food is about a 5 on a 10 scale. You will probably need to ask them to make it spicier even if you are not one of those crazy people that have to eat everything hot. 

4. They do NOT use reheated rice. I was expecting reheated rice that you typically find at Wongs and other Chinese restaurants. This place had fresh soft and sticky rice. It was great.

5. Don't take the American menu for granted. It's done pretty well and includes mainstream meats like chicken, beef, pork. The Chinese menu has tripe and meats not typically eaten by Americans which is why it's left off the American menu. You will likely use the American menu as your base and then use the Chinese menu to add select items. Bottomline: get both menus

6. The restaurant is not a hole in the wall. It's the opposite. It's the nicest Chinese restaurant I've been to in the valley. Yes it is small but stylish and well lit

7. The restaurant is definitely busy but not stand in line busy. We were immediately seated and we went on a Friday night at peak hour. 

8. The service was suprisingly good. Like most great and authentic Chinese restaurants, the service is lousy with the waiters being expressionless and forcing you to order quickly. The servers were Chinese but were very friendly and acted like family. They didn't rush you. Water was refilled quickly

9. Dishes - read what has already been written. This is covered well. I insist on order the the Water Boil dish (includes choice of chicken, beef, fish or shrimp) and ordering it spicy!

10. You don't have to be with a big group, a grad student at ASU or someone who speaks Chinese to enjoy this restaurant. The idea intimidates people because they make it sound as if it's so authentic since it's included in the Chinese Cultural Center but don't be.  My wife and I are not Chinese and it was just the two of us. And we had a great time"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant for Chinese food. I drove all the way across town just for their lunch special. They have great prices on a huge selection of items! I would definitely recommend this place. I personally love the chicken and vegetables and beef and broccoli. You get a great portion of food for the price as well."}
{"text":"Took almost 2 hours for delivery and then THEY ADDED THEIR OWN 4$ TIP!!! I didn't authorize it give them this! How dare they! DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese Restaurant. The food is incredibly traditional and the service is pretty good. One item I always get is the Spicy Frog Soup. It's mouth numbing and super tasty. Even the broth is worth drinking. 

If you enjoy traditional Chinese food, this is the place to get. If you DONT like traditional Chinese and like Panda Express and the like, then steer clear."}
{"text":"This marks my first true tasting of Szechuan food. I ordered two items from the traditional menu: dumpling in chili sauce and Hunan bacon. Each were deliciously tasty, however had similar favors. I'm guessing the Szechuan peppercorn?

The service was marginal. I was greeted quickly however I sat at my table for about 15 minutes after I was done before the server approached me. I wasn't in a hurry, had a book to read (came alone as the other half isn't adventurous when it comes to food) and had plenty of tea left in the pot. 

Would I come back? Definitely."}
{"text":"Make sure to get their secret Asian-only menu! Their food is pretty damn amazing.
Their service sucks, but, honestly, if you can avoid taking it personally and being butt-hurt, it's completely worth it."}
{"text":"Went there for authentic Chinese food. Was not disappointed. Got the cumin lamb water boiled fish kung pao chicken and orange chicken. Awesome fish...kung pao was good too. The lamb flavor was good they can improve the quality of lamb. The texture was just not there. Or they can make an effort to make it crisper. 
Overall good. But won't go again as lamb was not on the spot."}
{"text":"Being Asian, I judge Chinese restaurants by the service (which isn't great in amazing chinese food restaurants) and whether they speak the language.  Szechwan Palace met both these needs.  I understand the Asian population in Phoenix isn't as huge so they'd need to have the Americanized menu.  The soup was amazing and we even ordered an extra to go.  Anything spicy that you order will be SUPER spicy so be cautious when ordering.  It's authentic enough for me to want to come back here although I haven't tried any other places in the area yet.  I didn't understand the canned Lychee dessert at all, where's the mango pudding or the almond jelly?"}
{"text":"I think this might be a new Chinese place I need to go back and try some more. First of all, AUTHENTIC Sichuan dishes! Not just in name only! Holy cow! I picked up my parents from the airport and we decided to give this place a try since they were always disappointed at Golden Buddha. What is this? Water boiled XXXX? Last time I had that was visiting family in China! Ordered Water boiled fish and twice cooked pork. I really like the flavoring of the twice cooked pork. I wanted to order the Yu-shan pork but was overruled by parents. Oh well. They didn't want spicy, so the water boiled fish wasn't after the told the waiter not to make it spicy. Guess I'll have to try again. So, definitely more dishes I need to try. For now, I am happy that there's an authentic sichuan food place in Phoenix and not just the lame old American Chinese that are so totally boring. I am so very disappointed that the Shanghai place next to Golden Buddha has changed owner and they no longer have the special Shanghai menu and the quality of the food has gone down the drain.

Update:
Tried the water boiled pork. That I thought was pretty good. The meat was nice and tender. The sichuan peppercorn made everything taste lemony to me later on, including the water. I guess that must be the numbing effect people talk about. I also liked the beef with jalapeno pepper. Nice flavor. And I still really like the twice cooked pork.

I think the restaurant would be better served if they got some more comfortable chairs instead of the unpadded straight back wooden wobbly chairs they have now."}
{"text":"I'm glad that this place, one of the few eateries in the valley that specializes in Sichuan cuisine, serves really flavorful food with that spicy-tingly-slightly-numbing kick that can come only with the use of prickly ash, otherwise known as Sichuan peppercorns. Of course not all dishes they serve are that way; you can get mild dishes such as the fish fillet & egg white dish that I ordered; that one featured nicely seasoned, very tender fish fillets in a white sauce with ribbons of egg white. The servings are generous (I ordered the dan dan noodles as appetizer and it was listed as such, but it came as a meal-sized portion) so come with a big appetite. The atmosphere is relaxed, service is middling, and location is convenient (Chinese Cultural Center on 44th Street near the 202)."}
{"text":"I don't know about the other menu options but the jalapeno chicken was horrible. The chicken pieces weren't even browned. The sauce sucked. I ended up eating steamed rice and soy sauce for dinner."}
{"text":"My husband and I thought we would give this place a try and were very disappointed! I ordered this soup that tasted horrible. My fiancée usually never complains and will eat anything but even HE wouldn't eat the soup. I picked off his plate which wasn't bad but wasn't great either. When another waitress finally came to clear off our table, she just grabbed everything off and dropped the check off. We had empty waters and didn't even get asked how our food tasted or get that horrible soup taken off our bill. We will NEVER be returning to this place."}
{"text":"I don't know how we even came across this complex.  Luck I guess.  

Did anybody say it yet? well I'm not gonna look through all of the reviews and I'm too lazy to CTRL+F.  But the water boiled beef is the SHIT! I couldn't decide between the chicken or beef, so the waitress let me do a combo. SWEEET.

Chinese broccoli, dan dan noodles, too many goodies to name!

Loav dees pless"}
{"text":"Just to clarify this is NOT a hot pot kind of a place. They have premade hotpot but NOT the kind of hot people are looking for. I was very confused by some of the reviews and wanted to clarify to anyone else looking specifically for that \"fun\" hot pot environment. This is NOT it!"}
{"text":"This was the fourth time at the restaurant.  See ice was slow. We had the dumplings  they were undercooked and needed more seasoning. The sauce was too ouly.tried the jalapeno  chicken . They were way overcooked  and too much red chili's. And not enough  jalapeno. Shrimp was way small   and disappointing . Bla k bean ribs were also way overcooked"}
{"text":"Good place! Kong pao ck and eggplant are super yammy!"}
{"text":"Taste is okay, lamb BBQ should worth a try"}
{"text":"I would have to say  that Szechwan Palace in the Chinese Cultural Center has to be the best Chinese Food that I've had in Phoenix & I've eaten at a lot of different Chinese restaurants over the years... All of the entrees were very flavorful, & came out of the kitchen piping hot in a timely manor, The servers were helpful , pleasant, & very polite. Now for the most attractive part of this dining experience... The amount of delicious food the my friend Michael & I got for just under $30 (The House Combo for 2) was astonishing. For that price we got hot  green tea to keep us warm, 6 pot stickers, 2 spring rolls, 2  full entrees, a big bowl of sizzling rice soup a huge plate of house fried rice with chicken shrimp & pork in it, & to top it all off a bowl full of sweet lychee fruits for desert. Lets just say I will be frequenting the establishment in the near future. For all you out there on yelp or Facebook in the Phoenix area that wanna try this restaurant out it is located in the Chinese Cultural Center on 44th St. & Cofco Dr. just south of the loop 202."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Their xialongbao was amazing. Pretty close to what I've had in Taiwan. The orange chicken was good. Pleasantly surprised to have actual orange bits in the orange chicken. The steamed white rice was ok. Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Eh. Not really \"Authentic Chinese Cuisine\"  like the sign indicated.  Although we had a coupon, I would have still rather have paid full price for a meal elsewhere.   Probably a good place for people who think that Panda Express is \"real\" Chinese food."}
{"text":"A vendor from my job took us out to this place and I'm grateful he did! I have been here once a week since then. The water boil fish and the chongping chicken are phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I occasionally crave Chinese food, but we're in Phoenix...which isn't as culturally diverse as one my think. However! I've been to the Chinese Cultural Center (COFCO) for festivals and shopping.  Szechwan Palace is situation in the foremost corner of the Center.  One can dine in or take out.  Most of the patrons were Asian, which is a good indication that the place serves authentic food.  Don't come with high expectations though, this is not a posh place, by no means.  But the food is delicious! I was able to get a respectable glass of Riesling too.  Service is seriously lacking. The waitresses are in no rush to serve.  I waited over 10 minutes after I was seated for someone to take my drink order. I gave the order for drink and appetizer at the same time. The appetizer came out ten minutes before the drink finally came.  I thought to myself, \"this is going to be a loooong evening...\"  The good food justifies the long waits. ...I guess."}
{"text":"I have lived in Phoenix for about 18 months now.  My first six months I had plenty of chances to eat out.  The whole time I was looking for more authentic Chinese food.  Not the overly sweet sauces of americanized Chinese food, but edgier stuff.

While living in the Netherlands (where Chinese food is even worse than Phoenix) we learned that good Chinese restaurants have two menus, one for the casual Chinese eater looking for a step up from Panda Express and Chinese buffets and one menu for the die hards, native Chinese food eaters.  Often these menus are not even in English (or Dutch as it were).

Well, my looking in Phoenix has come to an end.  Szechwan Palance has such a menu.  Granted, theirs is not so seret, they share the same menu, but in different sections.

I have been here twice and I have found the food to be quite good.  there are some edgier dishes that we have not braved yet (i.e. kidney, brains, intestines, odd seafood etc.) but the ones we have tried have been quite tasty.  

Dan Dan Noodle, simple and right on, small bowl, but rather cheap.
Chinese egglplant in spicy bean sauce - very good, ordered it twice, and I do not even like eggplant.
Beef boiled soup - I have grown to love this dish over the last few years (starting in netherlands),  There are so many flavors and interesting items included.  We love to get rice with it to sop up as much juice as we can.  though we have been told by friends that broth is simply there to cook the meat and veggies, not to eat as a soup.

We have Chinese national friends and they all claim it is a great place for authentic Chinese Szechwan.  

The Service - many comment on the service - OK it is only so so.  Last time we were there they never even asked us if we wanted anything to drink.  Had to ask them to clear dishes etc.  Not really rude, just not what we are used to in restaurants.  I wont let this curtain our dinning there, I count it as part of the experience."}
{"text":"For the price at lunch I am not sure you can get much better.  The food is good to great.  The price is cheaper then Panda Express and it blows that out of the water.  I love the Sweet and Sour, and the Kung Pau.  They give you soup and a salad with your meal as well."}
{"text":"Best authentic Chinese food in Phoenix.  It's authentic so don't compare this to Panda Express or those westernized fake Chinese food. You will be disappointed. Don't go if you don't like authentic Chinese food. If you do like it, then you will be in heaven. I never thought I would be able to find a place in Phoenix when I was visiting the city for a couple of nights.  Glad I found it. Will visit it again when I next go to Phoenix. For sure!"}
{"text":"Exceptional, authentic cuisine! 
Fast delivery & a bit of a hidden gem.
I just had a friend in from New Zealand who is a bit of a 'foodie' but a snob about it, lol ... 
He was delighted with the moo shu.
Really enjoyed the food & great service.
Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This place was a big surprise!  We were actually going to T spot a few doors down but the place was empty. So hubby and I decided to forget ramen, let's go Chinese!  They are good, very tasty!
Hubby ordered the MaPo Tofu. I had the Pot stickers and Pork veggie rice cake. Excellent"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a couple of times on business. The lunch rush was intense. Definitely with the short lunch hour in mind, they expect you ready to order almost as you sit. Dinner, I had carry out. It was a fairly long wait. Both times the food was above average. I will probably go back because its close to work. But I wouldnt drive out of my way to eat here"}
{"text":"Horrible service! & very dirty!!....found roaches in the corner by our table and the restroom, told the waitress but took her 10min to get rid of it.....plus we had to walk from our seat to the front and ask for refills and 2 plates tasted wrong and when they took it back they failed with reordering, after we finished we paid and left...the hostest was rude and had the nerve to come out and demand a tip and when i told her they don't  deserve a tip she grabbed my arm smiling saying nooooo, I told her to get her hand off me....thank God my family was there to keep me in check other wise I might've thrown a punched....I do not recommend this absolutely Nasty, Dirty, Disgusting, rude service, horrific place, it needs to be shut down!"}
{"text":"Not very good, and the service is marginal. I ordered cashew chicken and hot tea for lunch. It comes with salad and soup and choice of rice, however the server said \"egg drop soup\" - not asking, but I figured a lucky guess, then he left. He never made eye contact, didn't ask what kind of rice or salad dressing. The soup came, still no eye contact or words. It tasted like canned. Then the food - again, just put there and the waiter disappeared before I could say anything.  The tea never showed up, nor did they check to see if I needed anything else before bringing the bill. 
     The \"salad\" was a micro bit of iceberg lettuce swimming in Ranch dressing (really? at a Chinese restaurant?) I did't want to use a soup spoon to eat a salad, so I didn't eat it. The entree was swimming in too salty of a brown sauce, and the egg roll was marginal. Find somewhere else to go."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch one day because the excellent Asian Seafood Buffet next door closed (bummer!).  We figured, why not try a more traditional Chinese place?

It seemed like it would be good... The menu looked alright, like a typical small Chinese restaurant.  I ordered the General Tso's.  I have to say, it was terrible.  The breading was all wrong, the chicken was dry, and the sauce was an abomination.  Where was the soy sauce?  The ginger?  I submit to you that they simply took sweet and sour sauce, mixed in some hot pepper paste, and called it General Tso's.  I have made General Tso's several times, and nothing about this was even close.

The rest of the dish was forgettable... Just your typical white rice and water.  I'm sure this place has some good dishes, but I clearly didn't order one of them."}
{"text":"Reviewing as someone who knows authentic Sichuan food. The staff is super friendly and the food hits the spot. This is my Chinese food joint whenever I am in town. Recs:

Cumin Beef
Yangzhou Fried Rice
Dandan Mian

There's two menus - one for Americanized food and one for authentic. 

Lunch specials are a steal, but I prefer to order from the Chinese menu."}
{"text":"A few years down the road and I work elsewhere but was I the neighborhood. 

Tried dining in and ordered the Mongolian Beef. Pretty much the same as last visit: good, tender, saucy entrée, decent egg roll, atrocious salad. I ordered fried rice and got brown rice. The Hot and sour soup was okay but not great. They spice it with chili oil, not straight peppers, so it was greasy. 

The service was two stars only. Efficiency was priority one, regardless of customer service. My server got my order wrong, I was never asked what I wanted to drink, my plate was delivered without looking at me (she was checking on a neighboring table), same with the check. 

A lot of oriental customers, which spoke for authenticity but service needed to improve."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best pork soup dumplings or xiao long boa that i've had yet in Phoenix -not necessarily saying too much.  Also, their scallion pancakes were very well made."}
{"text":"Being from Seattle I know good authentic Asian good. This is hands down the best I've had living in Phoenix. It's just as good as the china town places in Seattle and of my ex's grandmas cooking. (He was Chinese) so that's saying a lot. I will most definitely be coming back."}

{"text":"Went there for lunch on 9/6/2013.  When we walked in the man at the front desk seemed uninterested and told us to seat ourselves.  We started to settle into a spot but got interrupted by a waitress who then seated us. Make up your mind people.  Menus came fast but without a drink order, we were both very thirsty as it was over 100 out side.  We also had to wait a bit long for the food order.  The staff seemed to pointedly ignore us and walk past our table again and again.  Our waitress eventually came to check on us but was so intent on speedily asking a quick question she started to walk away without a drink order again, we had to stop her.  

Food came promptly, with our drinks, but it tasted so so at best, about take out quality.  We chugged through the waters and soda very quick but the empty glasses sat at the edge of the table until we finally had to hold up an empty glass and yell over for someone to bring refills. Rude yes, but nothing else got any kind of attention.  

After we were done, yep you guessed it, waited forever for the check.  No excuse for a place with people at only 10% of the tables.

Another big issue:  They have a yelp coupon for checking in, even though it was presented at time of ordering, they WOULD NOT HONOR IT!!

Bad service, so so food and dishonest representation.  And we had been trying to get there for a long time.   At least it was cheap.

Update:  We were contacted by the manager regarding the coupon not being honored.  They said it was only for the dinner service.  Problem is, the coupon did NOT state that.  This makes it false advertising and constitutes fraud in my book.  Its called \"bait and switch\" draw them in with a false ad.  That only makes me feel worse about this place, can I take the one star back?"}
{"text":"when I saw the name of the restaurant, I found that it seems like as authentic restaurant since the Chinese name is on the plaque. In addition, when I came into the restaurant, the tables and chairs are traditional Chinese style since they are look like ancient Chinese furniture. Both Chinese words and English words are showed in the menu. What's more, the food in the menu seems authentic since some food can be only found in Szechuan restaurant such as husband and wife's pork lung slices. Then I ordered twice cooked pork, spicy deep-fried chicken and water cooked fish. To be the honest, the food there was not surprised me. As for material, the fish is not so fresh since Americans are not accustomed to eat fish in the lake. Most of them like to eat fried fish that is living in ocean."}
{"text":"The staff is excellent.  Both attentive and helpful without being pushy.  The food is very good and the wide variety of options guarantees something for everyone from the adventurous looking for an authentic Chinese meal to the picky eater who just wants Americanized fried rice."}
{"text":"My first visit to this restaurant was good, my mother, my sister-in-law and I were here together about five to ten years ago, maybe it is now under new management.  There must be some unknown rule about going after 2pm because I ordered house chicken and it had a protein matter that is not usually put into food but is a by product of men.  I have had house chicken many places but none quite like this.  Also, white rice with soy sauce was substitued for brown rice,  I know brown rice well, this didn't even look like brown rice, I am not sure it was jasmine either.  I wish I could say I had the run of the mill chinese meal,  it would feel better.  I said I had been here before with my sister-in-law but I didn't mention she was Taiwanese.  Don't worry I will never return to your restaurant, you even gave me Lipton tea for jasmine.  Next time just tell me you are closed or just lock the door.  
This"}
{"text":"We did take out here 4/2/17 while on a road trip staying in a nearby hotel and really liked it. The egg flower soup, rolls and potstickers were all great. The General Tso's was good but not great. It's so hard to find good Chinese in the southwest and our visit here was solid."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food in Phoenix.  I've lived across the street from them for two years and not only do they make the freshest, tastiest American Chinese food, but they are AUTHENTIC Chinese as well!  From Peking Duck to the best tripe to the best pork bellies, these people really do it right proper!  They don't deliver, but  you can order through Amazon and Uber.  Mike the owner is maybe the best small business owner I've ever met!  He cares about his customers, and he treats his employees extremely well.  If you have a chance in 2018 stop by, grab some food and sign the petition to stop the heartless new landlord from ruining the Chinese Cultural Center."}
{"text":"The first time I went to the Chinese Cultural Center, I ate at the Beijing Garden. I thought the Mongolian beef had way too many onions and I was trying to find the beef. Thinking... Where's the Beef!?! The last three times, I have gone to Szechwan Palace. The first time, I had orange chicken and it was tasty! For a lunch portion, I even had leftovers. The second time, I had Mongolian beef and it was good. There were plenty of pieces of beef. The third time, I had the house special chicken. I found out they don't include broccoli with the lunch portion. It wasn't a big deal, it was good. But, I have to admit that when I go back next time I'm definitely going with the orange chicken! The lunch specials come with salad, hot and sour soup or egg flower soup, vegetable egg roll and entree. I definitely recommend trying this place. The service is OK. Yesterday, they didn't refill our water. Other than that, it's great!"}
{"text":"It served it's purpose as a restaurant with good value and food. We came here looking for chinese food that wasnt kung pao chicken, sweet and sour pork, or potstickers and we were well accomodated with an array of authentic chinese dishes. 

Service was pleasant, and I feel bad for the waiter that wasn't happy living in Phoenix for 20 years, suggested he check out San Francisco."}
{"text":"I try to go to this place once a week. I have limited time for lunch. Staff seats me right away and usually within 8 minutes of walking into the restaurant the food is at my table. The lunch menu is not expensive and you get  a lot of food for your money. 
 
The staff is very friendly, quality food, great service, clean restaurant, great value. I wish all restaurants operated this way!!"}
{"text":"Staff was rude, unfriendly and unprofessional. The food was over priced and too salty."}
{"text":"Odd waiting staff but the food was delicious and came fast. Our table ordered sesame chicken, shrimp fried rice, chicken fried rice, fried wontons, steamed buns and spicy lamb. The spicy lamb was delicious. Fried wontons could improve as to put a little more filling in them so you the ratio of wonton to actual pork isn't drastic. Would go back for the lamb!!"}
{"text":"We were here during our vacation where we said we could not try a place twice. The whole time we were there we wanted to break the rule and go back to Szechuan palace. We ordered the shrimp with peppered salt. DELICIOUS. Twice cooked pork. DELICIOUS. pork with bamboo shoots. DELICIOUS. and the spicy squid. DOUBLE DELICIOUS!! The appetizers were also amazing! The pot stickers in chili sauce wee so juicy and I could not stop eating them! I would totally recommend everyone in Arizona eat here!"}
{"text":"Solid Sichuan food at the accessible Cofco Center. Everything I've had is good and cheap, with plenty of garlic and ginger. 

The service is about as good as you're going to get in a place like this."}
{"text":"They apparently don't have orange chicken (even though it's on the menu) so they suggested \"Spicy Chicken\" instead. The dish was literally 75% peppers and 25% chicken. It was inedible. I won't be ordering there again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice in the last few weeks and both times were with friends from mainland China - Shanghai and Beijing.  Both of these friends proclaim the restaurant as very authentic and I agree, having visited China at least a dozen times.

The food is tasty - I've eaten boiled chicken, kung pao chicken, pork noodle soup, pork dumplings, vinegar cucumber and sauteed garlic green beans.  All delicious although I have a feeling I was eating a lot of calories.  

So if you desire authentic Chinese food such as you would get in Shanghai or Beijing, try this place.  It's in the Chinese Cultural Center."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and have really enjoyed the food. The chili fried green beans and ma la fish are excellent dishes that combine spicy, peppery flavors. The wontons were pretty good as well. However, I do not recommend the xiao long bao here (thick skin with no soup and too sweet of a flavor). 

The service tends to be a bit aimless and slow, so don't have great expectations there. The prices are quite good and it's easy to feed a group on a budget."}
{"text":"The food here was really good. I ordered the sesamie chicken and the sauce was very good. The service was marginal at best but it didn't annoy me. I'd go back"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Phoenix. Very nice foods and very quick cooking. Nice environment (inside and outside), and nice service. I would recommend this place to any friends visiting Phoenix."}
{"text":"One word: authentic! I'm from South China and this is the only restaurant in town where I can \"fix my cravings\"!
Wish it's closer to where I live but totally worth the drive. If you are not Chinese, they have \"American menus \" for Asian fusion dishes."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Fried rice excellent. However, service was terrible. Each of our four person party's entrees was delivered 5-10 minutes apart. By the time my son's meal arrived, my mother-in-law had been politely staring at her soup for 20 minutes. Also, staff was rude. Don't recommend."}
{"text":"To food is good. The service is bad. The waitress never came back to offer refills on our drinks not even the water. It wasn't very busy. Another person brought our (two of us)$61 bill to our table before we were half done with our food at witch time tried to ask for more to drink,was told the waitress would take care of our drinks, never happen.  When we were finished my wife had to go look for to go boxes. The top it off I had to stand up to get someone to take our bill."}
{"text":"I used to hate studying, but one must study the massive menu before placing an order.

There are 2 Menus in one. Dishes that start with an A are the gringo dishes, Kung pow xxx mu shu vegetables etc. Then there dishes that start with a C, this means a dish unaltered from china. In come cases this means unusual ingredients like pork kidney, or just copious amounts of peppers as with the seczuan dishes. 

Being veg it took a bit of time to tease out dishes that were meat free and still had flavor but we managed a decent array, however I really want to go back and try some of the more exotic dishes and see if they can be made meat free. 

While the food is good, they may have a bit less service than the number of tables need so don't expect white glove service. But at these prices $6-8 for most dishes who cares."}
{"text":"This place is a real deal....food is authentic...if you think you are a spicy king or spicy queen who can eat spicy...try this place..."}
{"text":"The hunt for good chinese in the Valley continues... Had high expectations, but this place was just OK, not bad, not memorable. Nice friendly service. Place was packed at lunch, maybe I ordered the wrong dish? Sweet & Sour soup was blah..."}
{"text":"So I'll admit, I actually thought Miu's in Tempe INVENTED this style of cuisine. I had never had it or even seen it anywhere besides there (probably because of that whole \"secret menu\" thing chinese restaurants like to do). So when I moved from the Tempe area a few months ago, not being a stones throw from Miu's was, quite honestly, the saddest part.

When I found out the Szechwan Palace (Located about three blocks from where I used to live in Arcadia, BTW) also offered the spicy cucumbers, dan dan noodles, and spicy lamb ribs I had come to love, I was so excited to try it and PRAYED it would fill the void in my life that Miu's once filled.  Well, it didn't.

That's not to say it's not like 1000x better than any other \"Americanized\" Chinese restaurant out there (Also, it's hilarious that they have a an actual section of the menu called \"Americanized Chinese\"), but when comparing Apple to Apples (which I always do when it comes to restaurants like this) Miu's is a 5 and Szechwan is about a 3. Here's my deal (and i ordered my exact order):

1) Spicy cucumbers were warm  One of the most delightful aspects of this dish is the cool temperature combined with the heat.  Warm cucumber are gross.

2) Dan Dan noodles were standard. Much cheaper than Miu's though so that got them a star

3) Spicy Lamb Ribs were a little weak. I get that I'm a white girl drinking pinot grigio, but a can handle my heat.  Please don't coddle me. 

Basically, if you need szechwan in the area, which I do, I'm glad they are here.  But if you are looking for top notch food, go to miu's.  If you're looking for top notch service, don't get chinese, because it sucks everywhere."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! I have never been to the restaurant but the delivery service has been great! This will be the 4th time I have ordered here. No delivery fee which is amazing and they are always early with the delivery. The food is hot and tastes great! Make sure to try the spring rolls and the dumplings in chili oil if you like spicy food! There is nothing over powering about any spicy item here but if you call you can have them add extra spice and you can tell the difference. A must order if you are craving some delicious food!"}
{"text":"My lunch experience stands at 2.5 stars. My introductory question for you: Cheap and Fast vs. Quality?

They have decently sized lunch portions including soup, small salad, veggie spring roll and choice of brown or white rice. The Beef with Broccoli was just ok, but for the price, I couldn't complain. The sauce with pretty thick, which I mixed into the rice for a pleasant consistency. One of my coworkers got the \"average tasting\" House Chicken, and another had the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce. Not only did we literally receive the bill before it arrived, she was terribly unhappy with the seafood quality and flavor. Her Diet Coke didn't show up till the end either - producing more sour reviews on her part.  My \"veggie soup\" consisted of a piece of broccoli, three carrots and an onion slice soaked in wonton broth. Go with the egg drop instead.

I will mention that we were already grossly disappointed having learned the Golden Buddha was closed and it's hard to compete with them. For a quick, low budget Chinese food experience with a decent ambiance, Szechwan Palace is an option, but not a GREAT one."}
{"text":"This location opened just 2 months ago. We went in because we found a coupon...to our surprise it was delicious! Honestly,  the Kung poa chicken was described from my boyfriend as probably the best he has ever had. We also had the general tso's  chicken.  Also, a good sign is that we were the only white people in the restaurant :). Yes, that sounds bad- but its definitely a good sign in my opinion, Lol.  It was really good. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Last night I go to the this restaurant with my girl friend , this place has pretty good good and staff are very nice. However I have to spend a little bit more time to waiting for food. But I think waiting for nice food like this are not bad and deserved. So I think give 5 star is right."}
{"text":"The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. Not only did they serve us EXTREMELY salty food - for all three dishes and one EXTREMELY SOUR- we had three people in our party, so it's not just my opinion- when we told them to try it, they said it suits out taste and refused to cancel the charge until after thirty minutes of disputing with them. WILL NEVER RETURN HERE. (Btw Chinese people at our table so they actually know what it's supposed to taste like)"}
{"text":"If you are getting the lunch special to go, you don't get the salad!!!  What is up with that, the price wasn't any different.  When the menu says I will get salad, soup  and a choice of rice I expect exactly that.  I asked about it and was told that isn't for to  go.  Well it is not listed that way on the menu or on the web site.  I won't go back, was my first and last time.  Also the spring roll was just roll, bland.  I haven't tried anything else yet, but regardless I won't be back!!"}
{"text":"If you order from the Chinese Menu and not the American Chinese Menu items your food might be TONGUE Thrilling Spicy and your mouth might get numb.

We got started with the Sauteed Spicy Cucumbers. They were so crispy spicy and refreshing and were a nice start. I had the water boiled chicken and it WAS THE SPICIEST FOOD I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. It was SO SPICY I felt High and my head was flooded with Euphoria. My mouth went numb. I had this dish twice here before once with chicken and once with fish and neither time before was it this kind of spicy. It really was too spicy for me this time so I took home my leftovers and will thin it down for latter. The chicken in this dish was tender like no other place makes chicken. This really was an experience.

Our waiter highly recommended the hot spicy beef with pickled vegetables. The beef was very good and very tender like the chicken was and it also was a spicy dish but at a more comfortable level.

Portions were large and generous.

Service was pleasant (this time) but you only drink water unless you order a beer.

They don't clear your plates when you are done either.

It's an experience!"}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food. Even better than most Chinese restaurants in LA. It's a must go place If you live around Phenix and love traditional Chinese food."}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious.  If you like spicy Chinese food this is the place for you!  There are dishes that are not spicy also, but Szechaun cuisine is all about the heat!  This region specializes in spicy food.  If you don't like spicy, or can't handle it, I understand but you're missing out.  Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Ordered some simple General Tso and I'm pretty sure they emptied a bag of sugar into the sauce. Staff was good, even pleasant, place appeared to be clean, but the food was wholly forgettable."}
{"text":"So after reading all these reviews I thought to take a chance so I went to explore.  I arrived for lunch at 11am and was seated immediately.  The atmosphere was ok, and the bar looked a bit disorganized.  I ordered the the sesame chicken and egg drop soup.  I asked if I could pay extra for shrimp fried rice but was told no.  I chose the fried rice vs white or brown.  Soup came out first which I found to be very bland and very few pieces of egg in it.  On my 4th spoonful my meal arrived and I was not impressed by the way it looked.  The sesame chicken was only bits of fried chicken in batter covered with very little brown very thick and gooey sweet sauce.  Some of the chicken pieces didn't even have sauce on it and grossed me out because it was hard and bland.  The fried rice looked like it was done in a hurry with many white spots in it and with little taste.  The egg role wasn't bad although they did not serve with hot mustard sauce.  I will not be returning to this place."}
{"text":"My family's been coming to this place for years, and it used to be one of my favorite restaurants! Then we heard their head chef left a few years ago, and the quality wasn't as good anymore. Nevertheless, we were in the area last week and decided to try them out again. Came for dinner, and the place was pretty full! (Although, apparently the other restaurants in the plaza had closed down so it could just be due to lack of choice). 

We ordered our usual dishes, and they were still pretty good! The only disappointment was the cold noodles: They were pretty flavorless, and completely different from before. But the Chongqing Chicken (Bone-In) was still crispy and flavorful! However, the portion was much smaller than in the past. Another favorite of ours is the stir-fried green pepper potato strips, which didn't disappoint. Overall a solid spot to go for some authentic Szechwan cuisine."}
{"text":"The food is good, been there many times since it's pretty much on the way back to Tucson, the spicy chili oil is solid, which means their spicy dishes won't go wrong."}
{"text":"Finally! A decent Asian restaurant in the Phoenix area. And Szechwan too! Besides Yupha's for Thai in Chandler, it's so hard to find a good Asian restaurant here. And we've looked & looked.
We're spoiled by having amazing Chinese food in the Bay area for years and always looking for a good place- here it is.
Started out with the Cold Noodles in Chile Peanut Sauce-not so good (needed some ground nuts, cut scallions & soy sauce) but then,...great House Fried Rice, Mongolian Lamb and Sautéed Dried Green Beans. Just the right amount of heat. General Tsao's Chicken was really good tho I wouldn't have thought to order it. Good service as well. The Eggplant dish at the next table looked fabulous and will order that next time, when we definitely come back for a repeat visit. Yay!"}
{"text":"This place used to be excellent but is now mediocre at best. Maybe they changed ownership. Don't bother."}
{"text":"I went here the other day for the first time. Ordered dumplings there were so amazing. My fiancé ordered the cumin beef which was the best Chinese beef I've ever had! The flavor of the cumin and chili go so amazingly together. It was the most tender beef I've ever had. I ordered their rice noodle in brown sauce which the noodles and beef were also cooked to perfection! I did think that it was a little oily but the flavors were out of this world. 

For the service they were so nice to explain and suggest items. They aren't the friendliest, they are just to the point and they get everything very very quick (which I prefer). You go there for the food, not the dining experience. The interior is very beautiful. They were INSANELY quick in the kitchen. I was beyond impressed. I love the way they serve family style and they give you a whole pot of white rice. 

I will be coming back for sure!!"}
{"text":"The menu reads like a novel with its many offerings. Too many in fact.
So I did what every other non-asian does - order fried rice and some kind of chow mein.
What a waste.

All the nearby diners had ordered dishes resembling images from pages of Bon Appetit, so I sat there eating my rice and watching them eat some really cool looking stuff.

After you eat, visit the Ranch Market next door. 
They sell live frogs. 
Hang out long enough and you'll get to watch as the butcher takes you back to 7th grade biology where the only thing missing is Lauren Shockey screaming in your face when you commence to chopping away at his shit.

Anyway, it's a good field trip. 
Szechwan and Ranch Market. In that order."}
{"text":"It's really good Chinese food and decently priced as well. I really enjoy family owned buisnesses like this place. The people are genuine and treat you with kindness and respect. The hot tea is some of the best I've had in a really long time. I know that they offer buffet style sometimes, but when I went it was normal st down styled service. I was very happy and impressed to find yet another authentic place to eat great food."}
{"text":"New Discovery

Szechwan Palace is nestled in the Chinese Cultural Center.  The menu is varied and offers a very good value for lunch specials which include entree, soup, salad, and spring roll.

On this visit to Szechwan Palace, we ate off the Americanized Chinese menu.  The food was very well-spiced, flavorful, and freshly prepared.  We had the Mongolian beef and the Cashew Chicken.  Both dishes hit the spot!  The service was friendly and the decor is modern.

If you ever narrate should stop by and grab a bite to eat you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Am I impressed?---Not!....

I went here with 15 Authentic Chinese Nationals as my friend is Chinese and had relatives visiting the Phoenix desert!  We scouted this location and decided on this restaurant.

The sauces were a bit on the salty side---had to return a couple dishes back for the over use of salt...The rest was doable but nothing exceptional.  I didn't take notice of any frozen veggies being used, but it wouldn't surprise me...Times being what they are, everyone tries to cut corners...on the other hand, the price charged for our large group was reasonable, the decor was fine, and the location had plenty of accessible parking and felt safe.

The food did taste authentic but boring at best!---I guess that it is a cultural thing, and I need to get culturalized!  I did get tested for ---(never mind!), anyway, the culture turned out negative!---lol

I give it three stars---One for parking, one for location, and one for authenticness....

On a date though---PF Chang's! or Sushi!"}
{"text":"Got a restaurant.com certificate for this place.  Reviews seemed reasonable, so thought I'd try it.

This used to be Chinese Gourmet buffet.  I remember that place.  This is not a buffet, but a table-service restaurant. 

First, they have a large menu.  Lots of choices including many authentic dishes.  Appropriate music (Chinese) is playing.  Despite it being lunch time the place is very empty.  Including us a total of 5 people the entire time we were there.

The bathroom smells bad.  Toilets were flushed, but still smells bad. Tile falling off of the wall too.

On to the food.  The hot and sour soup was OK.  I had the Szechuan beef, and it was tasty.  They were stingy with the rice, but for me it wasn't a big problem because I'm trying to reduce my intake of rice and other grains.  Other people might not be happy with the rice quantity, though.    I would give the Szechuan beef 3.5 stars if I were rating only that.

My wife got the kung pao chicken.  It tasted odd.  I've been to Taiwan, and I know what Taiwanese kung pao is like.  This was different.  And not very spicy.  I definitely wouldn't order this again if we ever return.  1.5 stars on that one.

For the size of the portion I also think they are a little over-priced.  Not dramatically, but for $11 for the beef i expect maybe 20% more than what we got.  Other places would probably charge $8-9 for the same amount, I would guess, and that would have been more reasonable.  Like I said, not outrageous, but I did notice it.

So I have to go with 2 stars here.  Really 2.5, but I can't do that on Yelp.  As the two-star rating says \"I've experienced better\".  And I have."}
{"text":"When I walked in here, I was accompanied by my friend's wife and my friend's kid (my friend had to work and all three of them happen to be white).  If only I had a sign that said, \"I swear that the kid is not mine\".  I think that's what prompted them to give me the white people menu.  I looked at it, laughed, and said \"give me the real menu\".

I took the liberty of ordering a bunch of stuff.  I got the steamed dumplings and chili oil, dan dan noodles, celery and peanuts, and bacon and green beans.  The bacon green beans were awesome.  All the food was good, but that's what the money dish was.  Get it.

I'll have to come back for the hotter chili oil options when I'm not accompanied by a 2 year old....or do I just sneak him chili oil when his parents aren't looking?  Hmm...."}
{"text":"Had the water boiled seafood combo, way over seasoned, could not finish the dish, i tasted like a bowl of chloraseptic, mixed with hot sauce.... i like spicy food, but im pretty sure some insane person in the kitchen lost their mind when they made my dish ..."}
{"text":"I don't know about others but I personally think their cumin lamb dish is the best Chinese lamb dish I have ever had in United States. And it is very consistent. Their service tho is not that good. They messed up my orders a couple times. The reason why I  joined Yelp was actually to complain about them in the first place. Well then I figured out a way to compromise: call and order to go!! Haha so still four stars."}
{"text":"They've got a dish they simply call \"boiled fish.\" If you like SPICY and great Chinese food, get this! I get it almost every time I go here. And their chow main noodles are THE BEST ANYWHERE.  I highly recommend this place - especially if you know the difference between great and mediocre Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"The name of this restaurant is too big for its britches. I had pretty good expectations for this place since many of my coworkers highly recommended it.

I went during my lunch, there wasn't much of a wait as it appears most patrons opt to dine in. Customers have the ability to call in or take out, which I did. It was nice to see that they had great pescetarian and vegan options which gave me a multitude of options. I decided on the lunch special of honey walnut shrimp and fried rice. It comes with your choice of egg roll, soup or salad for a little under $10. I waited for about 10 mins for my order and headed back to work.

Presentation:
I wasn't impressed. There was literally two scoops of rice (as if they'd used an ice cream scooper) that had no veggies whatsoever. My honey walnut shrimp(5 medium sized pieces) lay atop a small bed if coleslaw???strange (of all the foods you can lay shrimp on) there was also about 6 walnuts as well. 

Taste: 
The dish not only lacked color and presentation but flavor sadly. The worst part of all is I actually caught myself saying in my mind (of course) that even Panda Express tasted better! I don't know, maybe it was my order or maybe this \"palace\" serves pauper plates served up by employees just as so-so as the food.

In conclusion the employee I came in contact with neither the food was downright horrible. The prices on the menu don't match the quality of food and that is the sole reason I won't make another visit here. Who knows, maybe in the future they'll make their way to the Ranch Market and pick up a few spices."}
{"text":"The poor Szechwan peppercorn used to get a bad wrap. For the unfamiliar its not even related to the black peppercorn, for the familiar its spice properties can be quite magical. Actually the dried berry husk from the prickly ash tree, the USDA banned the peppercorn from 1968-2006. The peppercorn was seen as a hazard due to the potential of carrying citrus canker, a harmful bacteria to citrus crops. The process of heating them to 160 degrees kills any possible bacteria thus lifting the ban. Szechwan Palace, located in the Chinese Cultural Center, celebrates this daily. If you've ever tasted such dishes as Ma Po Tofu or Kung Poa Chicken, then you've had Szechwan cooking before.

The funny thing about these peppercorns is that they're not even really that spicy. At first the flavor might have a certain peppery pungency that gives way to more of a citrus like aftertaste. Though here's the kicker, as you eat them you might feel your tongue start to tingle then eventually go slightly numb. This sensation is strangely addictive, like getting a shot of Novocain; it might just leave you drooling over your plate.

For the unadventurous Szechwan Palace does serve your standard type Chin-American food like egg rolls and pork fried rice, but this isn't a strong point. Id skip those items and go right for the more unique dishes, be sure to ask for the full menu rather than the standard \"best of\" version.

Being a fan of offal and other not so famous cuts of beef, I ordered up the #3 Beef Tendon in Spicy Sauce ($6.95). Fresh cilantro and chewy slices of tendon are mixed with peppercorn oil were a hit. I know that dish isn't for everyone but trust me, its tasty. By contrast the #9 Spicy Cucumber ($3.95) is a little more approachable with cool pieces of raw cucumber seasoned with peppercorns and dried chilies.

There are a slew of dishes titled \"water boiled\" though none that I have tried seem to be in water. Instead you get a luxurious sauce filled with peppercorns, vegetables and meat or fish. This outing included the #18 Water Boiled Beef ($9.95), fork tender strips of beef in a velvety pepper spiked sauce made my tongue sparkle then go numb. Like I said, these peppercorns are magical.

My absolute favorite dish was the #98 Rice Cake ($7.95). The thin chewy disks of rice noodles, ground pork and cabbage were bathed in a slightly sweet and smoky sauce was craveable. 

When ordering the Special Cumin Lamb with Bone ($11.95), Id venture to say that they use the word lamb loosely. The difference between a lamb and a sheep is age and this directly reflects the flavor of the meat. The younger lamb is sweet and tender where sheep aka mutton tends to be extremely gamy and tough, these were definitely the later. No amount of fragrant cumin could cover the extreme gaminess of the meat. This may have been isolated since on a previous visit the dish was exceptional.

With over 100 choices on the menu plus daily specials, Szechwan Palace brings a whole new level of spice, even if it does numb your tongue."}
{"text":"Good Chinese Food At Good Prices!

$8.95 General Tsos Chicken was 4.5 stars of goodness at a good price!

Good serving size and friendly staff!

Great spot!"}
{"text":"If you are a Panda Express lover, you can go ahead and cross this place off your list.  This is authentic china food (See Eddie Lacy).  When you can find pork intestine and see whole ducks in the kitchen you know you are at a place that knows what they are doing.   The hot pot options are all delicious, the classic Mongolian beef is very good as well.  The tea tree mushroom hot pot is I think the most delicious item they have.  You cannot go wrong here on really anything you order!"}
{"text":"My mom discovered this place when she was in town and I'm pretty glad she introduced me to it! We had their fish fillets in black bean sauce, hot and sour soup and kung pao eggplant. Everything came out great. Although I wish the kung pao eggplant came with more sauce, it is very flavorful and the texture is just right. The hot and sour soup is awesome, not bland like many run of the mill Chinese restaurants around Phoenix. I just wish the rice was better quality, but it's still a great place to get good Szechwan food!"}
{"text":"Delishous!!  They have hundreds of choices on the menu.  This is a more authentic Chinese restaurant than most with so many Asian fusion restaurants I really miss ordering the old classics.  We had scallion pancakes (had to ask for dumpling sauce), moo shoo pork (hard to find these days), seafood Kung Pao (spicy and amazing), sauteed green beans (never disappointed) and a chicken hot pot (super spicy).  I will be back!  I hope the Asian grocery store in the cultural center opens up again soon."}
{"text":"Middle of the road Chinese cuisine. Nothing too special, appetizers tasted like they were from Costco. The other dishes were just middle of the road. Service was ok, food a little  bit cold upon arrival at the table. 
Would order takeout again, but rarely."}
{"text":"First time here during my vacation here! Looking for authentic Chinese food, read reviews about this place, sounds very authentic. Good food and services. Didn't wait long for food! :)"}
{"text":"The rude greeting I got when I walked in should have been enough of a deterrent not to eat here. The woman at the front desk taking the time orders of the people behind me while I'm standing directly in front of her should have been a deterrent. Unfortunately, I'm persistent. 

I got my lunch order to go and dove right in when I got back to my desk. It was already after 2 so I would have eaten anything. Well, I couldn't eat the lunch I got from here. I'm not sure why the chicken special tasted like shrimp or why there was literally frozen broccoli in it but it tasted horrible and was pretty inedible. I got 5 bites in before I gave up. Even the egg roll was disgusting and I'll eat anything fried. 

I wish I could get a refund but to ask for such a thing would require me to talk to people that shouldn't be in the service industry."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  Food was fairly tasty but cool and service was horrendous.  It took 30 minutes for the waitress to take our order, another 30 minutes for the FIRST entree (twice cooked pork) to arrive, and then DH had to wait another 20 minutes before his General Tsao's chicken came.  So we really didn't get to eat dinner together!  THEN, our appetizer, the steamed buns showed up--after we had finished our meals!  (We thought they had been forgotten, and at that point, we were so disgusted, we didn't say anything.)  Our server was very brusque, hurried, and never made eye contact during the few minutes she allotted us.  What a difference from another server we observed, who was all smiles and worked with the Jewish couple at a nearby table to order in such a way to meet their dietary needs.  We have always liked Szechwan Palace, but we think we'll try Beijing Gardens at the Chinese Cultural Center next time---that's how disappointed we were."}
{"text":"Over the past couple of years, this has been my go-to place for dinner to grab on my way home.  A couple of taps on the Grubhub app, and theres a steaming order of water boiled fish and dan dan noodles coming out just as I pull up.

Tonight was NYE but getting a table here wasnt a problem.  Had the water boiled fish, the chongquing chicken and tried the seafood hot pot that is on a separate \"hotpot\" menu you have to ask for.

The fish and chicken were awesome as always, the hot pot came with a lot of seafood: mussels, raw headon shrimp and some precooked squid along with a boiling cauldron of broth on a gas powered burner.  Tasted like boiled seafood because the broth is pretty weak and boiling isnt really my favorite way to have mussels or squid ... it was fun and very communal but I dont think Ill be ordering that again."}
{"text":"Came here looking for soup dumplings after having an amazing experience in NYC's Chinatown. I know it's really not fair to compare this place with what we had in NYC, but I definitely left disappointed. 

The service was lightening fast, but there was definitely the feeling that we received different service since we weren't Asian. For example, soup dumplings are pretty impossible to eat without the small porcelain spoon, but we received no utensils to eat them with at all. 

The eggplant was good, but was saltier and more sour than I was expecting. My mother said that her duck was pretty dry despite the copious amount of sauce on the plate. 

Overall, I would say good effort for Phoenix, but I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I've returned to this place 2 more times after my last review. Wait service was still inconsistent, especially with the dimwitted waitress.

The restaurant was plagued with \"out of foods\" often. A few months ago, the dimwitted waitress didn't tell us the appetizer was out till the end when I initiated the inquiry. Apparently she has already removed the \"out\" item from our bill.

The wait service for my last meal with a group of friends was better at 6:30 PM on a Saturday. We've got service from 3 different wait staffs. They were serving everybody else too. Not just us.

The food came out fast and the taste was right on this time. They were out of egg plant. We didn't tell them that 99 Ranch Supermarket was 2 doors down.

So diners, I still consider this place a good choice for authentic foods. I will give 3.5 stars this time."}
{"text":"The lunch was priced right, the portion were generous and all was cooked just right.  I had the shrimp and scallops = $8.00 covered all plus soup and egg role...  I iwll be back!"}
{"text":"Bad food. Bad service. Ordered two soup, Kung pao chicken with no peanuts, fish in egg whites and 2 drinks. Got the unflavored soups fast. Got the Kung pao chicken one minute later with peanuts and more pepper than chicken. Got the disgusting fish later. Did not finish the soups and sent the chicken back. After the waiter told me I never told him about the peanuts.  The fish had no flavor at all and had a bad smell. We did not eat it. Got back the chicken with so many peppers we used the fish plate as trash to clean the plate. Also kept picking peppers out of our teeth. The waiter came back and told me \"you didn't like the fish\" and left.  We never saw him again. The soup bowls were still on the table, along our pepper plate and our trash can fish plate. The hostess asked us if we wanted to take the food. WE DECLINED!!! We paid for everything and left hungry.
What a disaster. Will never go back."}
{"text":"According to a friend of mines whom is from the motherland - China.  The food here is pretty authentic.  I will have to take her word for it and go from there.  She ordered us some basic Szechwan style dishes, which I think she took it I didn't want to go too exotic.  --- I do actually I do ---  However, there's always next time!  Pigs ear, beef tendon, duck whatever!  Please I don't mind :)  For what we ordered, I thought it was pretty good.  I tell you what though, won't ever come without my friend since she knows how to order.  I'd probably order like a gwy-lo ---  hehe.  Our server was on top of it, but I gather it's because we spoke the language -- Plus 1!  The ambience was pretty basic, but with a bunch of mandarin speaking people eating and chatting away - felt like China after all haha!  - Enjoy!"}

Szechuan Palace is no palace by any means.  Not to say it looks dinky or dirty, but it's a mom/pop own restaurant.  Serving up classic Szechuan dishes and yes \"Americanize Chinese\" food too!  That was totally the highlight of the night!  Having that on the menu really tells my non-Asian friends what they have been eating at Panda Express or Pei Weis.  Yeah they're not actually Chinese food....

Szechuan food is actually very spicy and originate from Southern China.  So my expectations of spicy food was not disappointed.  We ordered some \"Americanized\" dishes and some traditional dishes.  Fried string beans, kung pao chicken, ma po tofu, pork belly, stir fried peppered steak, etc....Point it is we ordered a lot!  Why? Because the prices here are dirt cheap!  I totally dig a place that has food that's not over priced because of it's location or name.  

Overall, Szechuan Palace serves up some pretty good Chinese cuisine.  I personally don't care for spice, but if you need it because your life depends on it then this is a place for you.  Pretty authentic from what I know and after a few Ching Tsao, that spicy and salty tasted is well welcomed and a great combination! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Szechuan food! If you love this style of spicy Chinese food then this is the only place to go in metro Phoenix. Located conveniently at the Chinese Cultural Center. My favorites are the spicy fish, spicy egg plant, spicy pork, and spicy frog legs! Delicious! It's a must anytime I'm in the area."}
{"text":"i think this is the ONLY place in the valley that offered a real, homestyle kind of soup. i was dying for a clear simple broth-based soup after a bout with food poisoning (thaaaaanks for cooking for me husband....). i dragged a girlfriend here with me. 
ordered the pork sparerib and wintermelon soup ($5!). hit the spot.

she actually had an appetite and ordered the stir-fried rice cakes w veggies and pork, and the spicy wonton. the nian gao (rice cakes) were good, but not the best i've ever had. the spicy wonton was mostly wrapper, and i wasn't a fan of the spicy sauce; every place makes it a bit different, and this wasn't my favorite, although it definitely packs a punch.

i'd come back, but with my mom to order in Chinese for me, and make a real judgment call on this from that. but for now, 4 stars for having what the sick girl needed!"}
{"text":"Extremely authentic Sichuan/Szechwan restaurant that I did not expect to find in Phoenix! I was in Phoenix for a residency interview and the program put us up in a hotel nearby. Due to flight delays, I ended up missing my pre-interview dinner social, so I walked over to Szechwan Palace from my hotel for dinner.

I'm glad I did! There were a few other Chinese restaurants in this plaza as well. Szechwan Palace had an extensive menu (as expected), and I found it amusing that they even had a section in the back explicitly labeled \"Americanized Chinese Food.\" xD Definitely order the authentic stuff though!

Unfortunately, my phone was not working so I don't have any photos of my food, but I had an amazing meal of sliced beef tendon appetizer and a fried intestines clay pot dish with bean sprouts. I went through several bowls of rice (also because I was starving), and still had leftovers.

Service was okay, but I also spoke Mandarin. Prices are reasonable, and portions are good. The interior of the restaurant is very nicely decorated, better than I expect for an authentic Chinese place, and there are plenty of seats. 

I also had fun exploring the Asian grocery in the same plaza after my meal.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND, just make sure you can handle that Szechwan spice! ;)"}
{"text":"Overall I have been rather happy with this place. Have ordered for delivery a couple times and the food was always prompt, hot and as ordered. The pricing is very reasonable, and the food actually quite good for a $6 lunch. Minimum of $15 on all delivery orders FYI. I personally always enjoy  a good chow mein and they make one well. 
Glad to have a place so close to my house to deliver that craving of Chinese when I want!"}
{"text":"Good food, one of the most authentic Chinese restaurant in Phoenix. Somehow I hope they have better service."}
{"text":"We got there after waiting over 30 mins for food at a nearby restaurant and gave up waiting...walked over to Szechuan and were so pleased with the speedy service at weekday lunchtime...,food was delicious! We will go back regularly!"}
{"text":"If you like spicy food, this is one of the best places in Phoenix to find it.  I was taken here by some Taiwanese classmates, and enjoy every trip I make.  It's not conveniently located, but worth the trip.

If you can find a Chinese speaking/reading person to bring with you, you will be able to order some of the specials and things that are only written in Mandarin.  

There are two menus, the smaller menu with more Americanized fare, and the larger menu with more authentic Chinese cuisine.  If you are into the American side of things, their food is what you would expect."}
{"text":"Was looking for Chinese buffet, and Siri led us here (NOT a Chinese buffet).  We stayed anyway and were not disappointed.  They have outstanding food - and good Chinese food is hard to come by.  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Good and tasty food. The food is freshly made to order. Vegestables are fresh crunchy. The place smells clean and looks clean."}
{"text":"Not the best but not the worst Chinese food.

Had the Schezwan Shrimp for lunch. Egg drop soup was brought out promptly and the main course after two spoonfuls of the soup.

Soup was nothing special. Egg roll almost flavorless and mushy. No ability to substitute Lo mein for rice. Better like rice. This IS a Chinese restaurant right? 

Everything came out on same plate. Cold salad next to hot entree next to hot rice. Most places serve these separately. Obviously a move to save servers work.

Iced tea was basically water. 

I didn't notice the menu advice until writing this. Maybe my experience would have been better? Probably the food but I doubt the service. Just a thought, have any of them been to an American restaurant where they give you BOTH menus?

Check was delivered halfway through meal. Thank you very much. You may go now.

Meh"}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Szechwan food, this is the location to go to. They have another restaurant, but we prefer this location. They have an Americanized menu, which is fine, but you come here for the spice! Too favorites are the sautéed green beans, cumin beef, maps tofu, chongqi spicy chicken, and XLB's. Lunch menu prices are great and dinner prices too. Everything is made to order so it comes out hot and fresh. Truly a place to try if you like it spicy."}
{"text":"Service was excellent but food is too salty and not good.  Asian Cafe Express in Mesa is still the best Chinese food in Phoenix Metro. This place is so expensive and not worth it. We had the the spicy tofu, Hunan beef, orange chicken, lamb sizzling plate, Steam bun, pot sticker in chili sauce. Nothing tasted good.  I think 3 of 4 of us had an upset stomach after having the spicy tofu. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Customer service was great and the prices are VERY reasonable. 

We kinda wandered our way into the Chinese Cultural Center on a lazy Sunday afternoon, I needed to pick up a couple of things from the market, and have been craving some genuinely delicious Chinese food (I was experiencing bad nerves exacerbated by systemic and repeated bouts of disappointment with my takeout and delivery options)...

ANYWHO...we got allllllll sorts of kerfluffled and twitterpated when we saw they had a dim sum section on the menu...not very many dim sum options, but all of them sounded pretty good to me (plus it was the first time I actually SAW a dim sum menu, usually I just see folks wandering around with carts of unknown treasures and delights...no carts on the day we went there though).   

The menu itself is GIGANTIC, HUGE, COLOSSAL (ok, not in a Cheesecake Factory way, but definitely more than you'll find at a hole-in-the-wall quick order-by-numbers place (ie #1 w/ chicken and #27 w/ shrimp)) ... and is broken down into Americanized and non. I love that. It gives me an opportunity to get something that I'm familiar with AND try some more risque items that I can't get from Panda Express. ;) 

So here's the dish:

***Wonton in Spicy & Sour Sauce (dim sum) - Heavenly
****Dumpling in Chili Sauce (dim sum) - Even better than the wontons
**Dan Dan Noodle (dim sum) - it was ok, but the other two were way better
*****Sauteed Green Bean - PHENOMENAL and second only to...
*****Yuxiang Eggplant (this was so good that if someone told me I had to eat this eggplant and those green beans every day for the rest of my life, I would thank them...and maybe offer my eternal gratitude). 

All of that came to about $30, we were stuffed and had leftovers for my lunch the next day.

Also, I went to their website (just now) and it looks like you can order takeout (Phoenix) or takeout AND delivery (Chandler) from them online. 

SOLID!!!"}
{"text":"Had the duck and frog legs. The frog legs were ok, but the duck was disgusting. the last bite I took tasted like soap and I had to spit it out. I'm not one to stop eating when I'm hungry."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for Chinese food everytime we go to the airport.  The first time we went the service was terrible, but the great food brought us back.  

We visited the Palace again last night and it was 100% better.  We had a gentlemen as our server and he was humorous and very tentative to our party's needs.  We ordered our food and 5 minutes later we had all four dishes in front of us (fresh and not pre-made).  My personal favorite is Szechwan chicken.  However, everything we had was great.  The food is very good quality Chinese food and it isn't overly greasy.  I love Chinese food, but it doesn't always love me back (if you know what i mean)!   The ambiance is very nice and the noise level is very tolerable. 

When you check-in using the yelp app it says you will receive a free dessert - but they don't honor it for some reason."}
{"text":"Love the food here but the service is horrible! There doesn't seem to be any order in which section the waiters worked in. They rush us thru order.....and then u have to flag them down if u want anything else."}
{"text":"For those actually from Szechuan like me, this is the most authentic taste I've ever tasted in Phoenix. And it deserves a higher rating."}
{"text":"Regardless of whether or not you like good service, it is irrefutable that Szchewan Palace serves authentic Szechuan cuisine. 

Food:
My parents are much more aware of the places to eat Chinese food in the Phoenix area. It is well known among all their friends and themselves that the chef here is one of the more talented chefs in Szechuan cuisine. He knows how to cook and he cooks well. Whether or not you like the food is probably more of a preference for this style of cooking (if you're ordering from the non-Americanized menu). We ordered Xi Long Bao, Fried Fish Fillets in Chili Peppers, Beef Tendon in Spicy Oil and Peppercorns, and Dried Tofu with Pork Slice & Celery. The Beef Tendon in Spicy Oil is what they are famous for and it was good. It is an acquired taste so that dish is not for everyone. The Xi Long Bao wasn't as thick skinned as a previous review had mentioned. They may have changed it since that review.

Service: 
I know this place gets a lot of heat for their poor service but our experience was 180 degrees. We were served by at least 3-4 different people and they were all very friendly. It may have been because my parents spoke Chinese or it may have been a different set of expectations. Chinese restaurants, in my experience, vary largely on their service because that's not what you come into a restaurant for - its for the food. If having good service is a critical component of your dining experience, I'd say this may not be the place for you. We did get our food almost within 5 minutes of ordering and our waters were refilled frequently throughout the dinner."}
{"text":"Szechwan Palace was the place picked for February's International Supper Club UYE,  and thanks to an reservation we did not have to wait to be seated, they had a table set up for us. We asked if they did separate checks, we were told no problem so I thought we were at a great start. How quickly that changed.

Here is what I noticed, if you are a regular, you seem to get great service, even a smile or laugh out of the staff, but if you are just some random diner picking this place to eat, then expect minimal to no service. The staff (I say staff because we had more than one person working for our table) was aloof and non-caring, sure they took our orders and brought us the food, but to ask for water, drinks, silver wear or even a clean spoon because the one brought with the soup was dirty, was a task, they seem happy to just take the order and slam the food down on the table when it's cooked.  Just really bad service.

The food on the other hand, I had ordered the Szechwan beef, it was sliced beef sautéed with veggies in a spicy Szechwan sauce. This was a great dish!  All though it states on the menu this dish is spicy, I found that it was just flavorful, so for me it could have been a tab bit spicier. I really enjoyed my dish, before I knew it, it was gone!

Great food, bad service, so sad, because I'm sure I would have enjoyed coming back, but I don't really enjoy paying & tipping for bad service (just because the server is bad doesn't mean you cheap out on the tip, others rely on that too) Hats off to the kitchen for some great tasting food!"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch special.  Great service.  The food was fresh and fast.  I like that they have traditional and American style of Chinese."}
{"text":"Last year, Szechwan Palace restaurant in the Chinese Cultural Center Phoenix, AZ was our most favorite authentic Asian restaurant. I would have given it 5 stars then. We heard that the Chinese Cultural Center was sold and is closing, so when we came back this year, we called and were told that Szechwan Palace was still open and they don't plan to move!   Consequently, we rushed right over for dinner last week.  What a sad place to see the entire Chinese Cultural Center with vacant shops, all except for Szechwan Palace.  The wait staff seemed somber, as well, and did not seem to care if we received good service.  We ordered our food and found it to be below par from when we were there last year.  One of our party ordered a lamb dish that is completed by cooking it at the table on a hot pan.  When the waitress brought it, she threw the hot mess onto the even hotter metal platter causing very hot oil to be thrown all over the man who ordered it ruining his clothing and all over the tabletop.  But instead of reacting to his screams or trying to clean up the mess, she just walked away!!  We had to repeatedly ask for help and the wait staff just stood there stone faced not cleaning up anything.  Finally, after we complained for the 4th time, our waitress said she would check with her boss who then gave us 10% off the check.  Luckily, the hot grease hit his clothing and not his skin.  Otherwise, it would have been a terrible thing. But, like I mentioned, no one there seemed to care.  I ordered Kung Pow Chicken that had so many chopped red hot peppers that one could not see the peanuts in the dish.  It was so spicy hot that I could not eat it and switched with hubby who can tolerate that kind of heat in food.  As an appetizer, we ordered crab puffs that were overcooked just to the point of almost being burnt.  The restaurant was packed that Saturday evening with perhaps 75% Asian patrons.  There is an American menu for those who like things less spicy and a Chinese menu which is served differently.  The prices are reasonable.  I really hope that this restaurant can find a new home or survive where it is so that the employees can be happy once again and the cooks can turn out the authentic Chinese food we have loved here in the past."}
{"text":"When I called the lady answering barely understood what I was asking for. I asked for lunch special and she sounded lost. Second, the orange chicken was soaked in the red sauce. I mean don't get me wrong I love the red sauce but it was just TOOO overpowering! Then it was just too fried up where I had a hard time chewing it down! Unfortunately, this is a first and LAST time here..."}
{"text":"Awesome food!!! The best Szechwan food in Phoenix!!
Great location in China town and next to the chinese supermarket. Great for groups as well!"}
{"text":"I wish I could have rated the food, but after 10 minutes of waiting at the front of an understaffed restaurant I decided to leave. There were people waiting for any drink at all the entire time I waited, people looking towards the waitress and then back at their empty plates, and others waiting along with me to be seated. I really looked forward to trying this place, but I don't think I will return."}
{"text":"Took 1.5 hours for delivery, and I called and was informed that there were only 2 deliveries including mine.  Could barely understand woman on phone.  When delivery guy finally appeared at my door, knocked, heard my dog bark, and when I went to open it, he had ran away.  I had to coach him to come back with my food so I could sign for the bill even though my dog was inside.  Food was overpriced and soggy.  Will not go back again."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for lunch. It was reasonably priced, had good service and the food was pretty tasty. It's your standard Chinese fare with $7 lunch specials that come with soup, rice and an egg roll. We had the sesame chicken, sezchuan shrimp and dumplings in spicy broth. All these things were good EXCEPT for the stupid salad with ranch dressing that comes on the side.....while I appreciate the salad, I wouldn't really call an iceberg and ranch dressing salad \"authentic\" like the restaurant advertises."}
{"text":"I AM AN IDIOT
I've spent years bitching about the lack of even a DECENT chinese place near our house (Baja Arcadia). I kept looking to Scottsdale for somewhere to eat. We've got just about everything else, from real-deal taco shacks, to excellent Pho, to fine dining. But no real Chinese food. I was looking the wrong way. Up til recently, I would drive all the way to Wong's Place in Tempe just for the real stuff.


THE CHINESE CULTURAL CENTER
I shop regularly at what used to be Ranch99, that oasis in the desert that makes you feel like you've been transported to the Hell that is Riverside CA. I've tried numerous restaurants in the mall over the years and always been disappointed. The one I never managed to try is the Szechwan Palace. I expected it to be just another Gringonese disaster. Man was I wrong. We eat out maybe once or twice a week, and we've hit this place at least once a week since we found it a few months ago.


SZECHWAN PALACE
I love you, Palace. Dan Dan Noodles. Spice. Yu Xiang dishes. We've been when it's packed full of high maintenance Chinese businessmen and when we're one of 4 tables in the place. Every time, the tiny kitchen and the wonderful servers keep their smiles in place and just give you that little shake of the head that says: \"Solly, it clazy tonight!\" Even though this place pleases real Chinese food lovers, there's plenty of stuff to keep my Jewish mother-in-law happy too (\"happy\" is a relative term).


THINGS I LOVE
  - Wan Fu: the worst white wine in the world (that I love)
  - Dan Dan Noodles with extra hot chile
  - Yu Xiang Shrimp
  - Mongolian Beef with real beef, not that over-marinated rubbery crap
  - Fresh veggies that still have some color and snap to them
  - Incredibly spicy Water-boiled dishes
  - Any of their soups

Wong's thick-skinned pot stickers are still the best, but everything else at the Palace rules.


BOTTOM LINE
It's hard for me to imagine a bad review being credible unless some key person was missing or they were ridiculously understaffed and got slammed. We've been there for one of those nights though, and it was still very good, once we eventually got served. As others have said: get the real menu as you walk in. Otherwise, you'll get the Panda Express version. You'll also have to grab chopsticks. Other than that, just enjoy!"}
{"text":"Have been to the restaurant a few times and the food was good every time.  We used to go because of the market next door, but now, we would really have to just go because we wanted to go.  

The price is reasonable on menu compared to other restaurants with the similar style."}
{"text":"Went here in the recommendation of friends.  Bad idea!  Coming from San Francisco, my expectations for Asian food is very high.  The spicy chicken dish was weird.  I could not determine what type of meat it was.  The fish dish was average at best.  Both dishes lacked flavor.  I emptied my water glass during our meal and it just sat until the meal was finished.  In fact, I didn't see any wait staff for quite some time.  Yes, we were there at an earlier dining time but seriously, we didn't expect to be ignored.  The hostess happen to walk by and saw me looking around for help..  She asked a staff person to help us finally.  Not right.  Sorry, no future visits planned there.  Very disappointing visit."}
{"text":"This was my first time at SP. We waited about 15 min after being seated before someone came to take our order. We were never offered or asked if we wanted anything to drink. We started with pot stickers and egg roles then continued with orange chicken. After ordering, the pots tickers came right out and tasted old and deep fried when the menu said pan fried. Within 2 minutes after getting the appetizer our entree came out. It really worries me when food comes out that fast. All the food tasted old and refried and the fried rice was mushy.

The service was not good and no one came back to check on us or to refill our drinks. The waited disappeared and the only reason we got boxes or a check was because the busser  saw me looking around for service. 

We will probably not return."}
{"text":"Ordered late night delivery here because our typical AZ Chinese place was closed. I'm from New York, so I may have a really high standard for Chinese, but I found the food here to be terribly bland and almost tasteless. To be honest, I don't understand how this place has such high reviews."}
{"text":"This is by far the most authentic Chinese restaurant in Phoenix.  The only problem is you have to know what to order.  Which basically means go with someone that can read off the Chinese menu.  If you're coming here for fried rice and crab puffs, you won't be impressed."}
{"text":"This was a great way to end my stay in Arizona! It was also the first time I saw any Chinese people in Phoenix. Located in the Chinese Cultural Center of Phoenix, Szechwan Palace has delicious Chinese food (reminds me of home), and is located close to the airport if you're looking for a quick and delicious meal. 

My mom's friend took me here for a quick dinner before dropping me off at the airport. She goes there often so the waitstaff already knew her favorite dish and bantered a bit, teasing me because of my Taiwanese accented Mandarin and because I can't read Simplified Chinese (it's so confusing though, with all the straight lines and boxiness...). The food was great, the inside clean (light wood floors and tables and white painted walls, making it feel very spacious and airy).  

We ordered: 

1. Wu Gen Chang Wan - I don't know the English name of this, but it's a stew of pigs intestine, pig's blood, leek, white cabbage (the one in kimchi), and red peppers. It was the perfect kind of spice, that warms your mouth, but didn't distract from the flavor of the pickled vegetables, the lightly textured blood, and the flavor of the intestine. The intestines were extremely tender without any chew to them, so you could bite right through and taste the fat and the flavor. It wasn't even stinky at all. 

2. Yi Xiang Eggplant - Your usual eggplant from a Chinese restaurant, but with a Szechwan kick. Japanese eggplant sliced and lightly fried in a sauce that was mildly spicy with a hint of sweetness. It had small pieces of minced pork as well. The eggplant was not too fried or burnt on the outside, but well-done and soft on the inside. 

3. Hong Shao Pai Gu - This is like a braised pork ribs, served with whole shiitake mushrooms and sliced bamboo shoots. Some of the meat was a little tough, but the overall flavor was great (mostly soy sauce, maybe a little tamarind). This dish was NOT spicy, so it was a good break for my mouth in between the other dishes. 

4. Bo Cai - Sauteed spinach with garlic. Fairly typical, the kind of spinach that makes your teeth feel like they've been scraped. Good to get a little green in  there. 

The atmosphere was pretty nice and conducive to a conversation. Apparently you can request more spice; I didn't know that or I would have. I guess this is the usual mild level that they give to new customers. 

It seemed the place was very popular; there were constantly people coming in and out, and several families with small children, which the staff was very accommodating to (with booster seats and high chairs). There were also many Chinese patrons, which is always a good sign. It was also nice to hear conversational Mandarin around me after so long...

If I ever return to Phoenix, I'm coming straight here to get a real Chinese food fix!"}
{"text":"Yum! I got the lo mein and it was delicious! The restaurant was packed, for good reason.  My only complaint was that the person I went with got her food 10 minutes before me.  I'm not sure if they forgot about my meal, or if it just took longer to make, but it was kind of weird.  Anyways, overall it was a good experience and I would come back."}
{"text":"I came during lunch hour.  The place was packed.  People had to wait to be seated.  They offered lunch menu items.  The service wasn't great.  But the food came quickly.  I ordered the spicy fish filets.  That was really good.  But the rice cake and shredded tofu with pork were disappointing."}
{"text":"Okay, people. There are NOT a lot of good Chinese restaurants in the state of Arizona. I know this because I have tried almost all of them in search of finding something equivalent to the restaurants in California.

Szechwan Palace is the best place I have eaten at in this entire state so hooray for them!! I LOVE LOVE their pickled cabbage. It is ridiculous spicy and that just makes me extremely happy. You MUST get their Chinese menu (I think they have a different Chinese and American menu for people who are not used to eating traditional Chinese food). Their spicy cumin lamb is soo good. Actually, I've gotten a lot of dishes there and haven't really been disappointed by anything during dinnertime.

Warning - during lunch, I think their lunch specials are only American-Chinese food which consists of orange chicken and broccoli beef which really does not represent how good the food is. Go for dinner and experience the real Chinese food :)"}
{"text":"Delivered food, didn't provide sweet and sour sauce for two dishes that should come with sweet and sour sauce. Lady argued about the fact that she did put the sauce in and then told us would be twenty minutes before sauce came and they are 5 minutes away."}
{"text":"I've been to this Szechuan restaurant on numerous occasions. Their chef is from Szechuan, and their extensive menu encompasses both authentic and Americanized dishes.  The sizable square-shaped interior includes good lighting, booths, lazy Susans, and traditional Chinese artifacts. 

The flavors of their Szechuan specialties are far more compelling than the Americanized items. These dishes often include meat, innards, or fish served in red chili pepper and a pool of tongue-numbing hot oil. The propensities of these dishes can be so intense that I often counteract with an order of light tasting vegetable or non-spicy items to lift the taste buds.

For appetizer, I recommend the Beef Tendon in Spicy Sauce ($6.95). The strips of shaved tendon came with firm textures seasoned by hot oil. The same tongue numbing effect can be felt with an order of Fuqi Feipian ($6.95), another chilled dish prepared with beef shank, heart, and tripe. 

For main entrees, my favorite is the Mao Xue Wang ($15.95), a dish stacked with red chili, hot oil, pork blood, intestines, luncheon meat, tripe, and bean sprouts. The Water Boil Fish ($10.95) can be a good choice too due to the thick cuts of fish filets and light tasting ingredients that work in contrast to the heavier spicy oil. Their Ma Po Tofu ($7.95) was fresh, spicy, and addictive too.

Dishes that I like to order to accompany the numbing flavors are the Spicy Cabbage stir-fry ($6.95) and Tea Smoked Duck ($12.95). The sweetness of the cabbage tends to outweigh the peppers in it. The duck's tea smoked flavors had the same effect, but the meat can also appear leaner and boney than expected. I was disappointed in the Xiao Long Bao ($???) due to its thicker skins and ground pork that needed more seasoning. The much anticipated juicy effect was nonexistent. 

The dishes that I don't recommend are the Cumin Lamb ($13.95) and Water Boiled Pork Kidney ($9.95). The composition of the lamb stir-fry with cumin, chili, and sesame was spot on, but the meat was cut too small for me to fully enjoy it. The Water Boiled Pork Kidney ($9.95) also fell into this category for the thinly shaved kidney that tends to lose its ways and chewy texture.

I had mix results with the Americanized dishes. In particular, both the Walnut Shrimp ($12.95) and Orange Chicken ($8.95) failed to stand out. The flavor on the deep-fried chicken with orange slices and sweet and sour sauce fell flat. I'm not sure why they use sweet and sour sauce, and a hint of spiciness would have made it more dynamic. Additionally, the House Foo Young ($10.95) that came with eggs and a mix of seafood and meat was delicious, but the thick savory gravy made it too salty in the end.

Lastly, the Dan Dan Noodle ($5.95) was not made wit the right sauce. The Spicy Wonton ($5.95) was too skimpy and the rice plates such as Shrimp Fried Rice ($7.95) and House Fried Rice ($7.95) were pretty ordinary without the wok tossed airy texture.

Service can be wildly inconsistent depending on the individual server that I was assigned to. Overall, the Szechuan items were tasty and enough to bring me back for more. They also have a lunch special menu but prospective diners should consider their water boiled dishes, meat items, cold plates, and stir-fried vegetables in order to get a decent fare. 2.5 stars. I hope to visit their Chandler location to see if they are any better."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I like their hot boiled fish, some cold dishes and beef stew. They have good chinese soups too."}
{"text":"I pick a little bug from a dish and this can't go away from my mind. Also as a Chinese, this restaurant tastes nothing like original Chinese food and the taste gets worse. I highly doubt the sanitary condition and the taste"}
{"text":"This place is just really really good. It may be pricey but I am a believer in you get what yo pay for. Fresh ingredients always cooked just right. Flavorful and delicious every time I go. Fast turn over times when I am picking up and taking my food to go, great service the few times I have eaten in the dining area. I always recommend this place as an east side of phoenix must try!"}
{"text":"Excellent Szechuan food. If you're coming here for the Americanized food, then you're here for the wrong reason. I highly recommend any of the 'water-boiled' dishes, especially the water-boiled beef. The literal translation from Chinese does not make it sound very appetizing, but trust me, if you like spicy food, then this is a great option. Also delicious are the spicy cucumber appetizer, pork with bamboo shoot, Yu Xiang pork, beef with pickled chili pepper, the wonderful eggplant, and a staple of every Szechuan restaurant; the stir-fried/dry-fried green beans. In general, this place uses copious amounts of Szechuan peppercorn, which I am a big fan of.

I usually get take-out, so can't comment much on the service."}
{"text":"This place had decent reviews.  Decent is a gratuitous word for this restaurant.  I had DanDan Noodles, House Special Chicken and House Special Fried Rice.

DanDan Noodles were good.  A bit plain but good! Deserves a star by itself!

House Special Chicken was decent.  Large plate.

House Special Fried Rice.  Horrible!  Rice was too wet and laden with MSG. Not salty but you know that 'salty taste' that lasts 30 minutes later?  MSG.  This is the main reason why I gave this place 2 stars."}
{"text":"Never been to the Szechuan restaurant before, surprisingly the food was good and so different than the regular Chinese food.

We had fish and bean curd, sautéed string beans and pork buns ( strangely none of these on the online menu), but they were on the regular menu at the restaurant.

I really like the sautéed string beans, not crazy about the fish and bean curd because there were floating whole cardamom and star anise in the broth and if you accidentally eat them it's taste kind of minty and tangy at the same time, it was ok and my husband liked it.
My son liked the pork bun as well. I really want to try something else next time, overall it was good.

When you check if on yelps, you'll get free fried egg rolls."}
{"text":"I've been looking for real Szechuan food in the valley for many months. I feel like I finally found perfect and authentic Szechuan Chinese restaurant for me! We wanted to have none menu food but they made it special for us. It was very pleasant. :)"}
{"text":"We did carry-out.  We are not experts on authentic Chinese or Szechuan food, but we thoroughly enjoyed the won-tons in spicy/sour sauce, the Kung Pao Chicken, the Hunan Beef, and the pork fried rice.  Everything was delicious and seemed to be made to order.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a gem in Phoenix/Tempee Area.  Just go when they are not busy. Went on a Thursday night and the food was awesome. Went on a weekend night and the food was okay. I recommend ordering the spicy fish."}
{"text":"Food is okay but service is terrible and super control freaks."}
{"text":"Gross! I have been to schezwan palace many times but today is the last! Food was ordered and when the plate was presented to me I see this roach walking around on the food! I will not be back-Ever!"}
{"text":"The food is really really awesome .If you don't order the regular Chinese restaurant item (yes they have those to ) you will get to taste Real Chinese food similar to what u would get in China .... the low rating u find in yelp and Google N other places for this restaurant however (I think ) is for the customer service u get . If u can take  the straight forward customer with a smile u will enjoy some really really amazing food . Just to make it clear ?.your order comes quick ..The water glass is never  empty ...Not bad or nothing but not something u get elsewhere . Like I said it straight forward . Everyone seemed to be enjoying the food  and when food is that good it's ok to focus on food"}

You have to try the Spicy chicken(with bones)"}
{"text":"Date of Visit, 8/8, Approximately 12pm

Szechwan Palace is very good.  They split their menu into authentic dishes & American dishes.  This place was recommended to me by one of the numerous Uber drivers that I have had on this trip.  I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken, & let me tell you, the plate with the chicken & the pot with the rice were huge!  I actually was not able to finish mine order, but I will definitely recommend this to anyone coming to Phoenix.  No stars lacking as the servers appeared to be very attentive."}
{"text":"The last two visits to Sezchuan palace was really good experience. I went here lots of times in the past couple of years and the food was okay. I believe they changed their chef and the dishes on Chinese menu are very authentic- I'm a Sezchuanese and some of the dishes can even be compared with those in LA. The service is above average too, I will definitely come back more often."}
{"text":"Today, I visited this place after not having been here for quite some time. The place use to not have all that many customers, but today (Sunday) the place was very busy for lunch. Despite being busy, they took our orders very quickly and we were served in under 10 minutes.
A problem that I had with Szechwan Palace in the past was that despite the price of around $10.00 for a plate (entrée) the portions were small and kind of stingy. But today, was very different. The portions were large and everyone at our table of 5 was able to eat with contentment from all five of our orders; the flavor was really good in my opinion. Rice here is free which is a must for a spicy place. 
Lastly, I'd like to say that I really enjoy ice water. Some places seem to be so stingy with their water. Today, four glasses. Awesome.
I'll be now visiting this place regularly.

My favorite:
C36. Yu Xiang Pork
Sliced pork stir-fried with wood ears, celery and bamboo shoots in yuxiang flavor (spicy)
C50. Beef with Onions 
Beef stir fried with yellow onion and scallion."}
{"text":"After not coming here for a whole my family decided to give it another try, and we were definitely surprised! The dan dan noodles as usual were fantastic, and what I said earlier about portion sizes getting smaller was totally wrong when they brought out the chicken! Service, which had been lacking before was fantastic. Overall, I would definitely recommend as far as Szechuan places go around here"}
{"text":"There are two ways to rock the Szechwan Palace:  1.  The small menu and a fork, 2.  The larger menu and some chopsticks.  You will likely be profiled upon entry and, unless you're Chinese, get a fork.  On my first venture to the SP, I didn't let my lack of chop slow me down.  Since the specials were off limit to us because they were \"in Chinese\" I ordered the water boiled fish.  As mentioned in other reviews, the sauce miraculously changes the way other foods (including water) taste and should be experimented with at length.  It isn't so much spicy as it is transcendental.  On my second venture, a friend snagged us some respect by grabbing the Chinese menu.  We liked the squid with pickle, missed out on the water boiled eel but settled for more of the fish, and really loved the baby bok choy with mushrooms.  It is best to end a meal here with some of the fine corn jelly candies at the Ranch Market next door."}
{"text":"Good food at a reasonable price.  It is easy to order and pay online.  The food was ready and waiting when we got there, but we had to wait for them to seat several parties before they gave it to us.  The lunch special was a great value and included an egg roll, soup & a salad.  The vegetable soup was great, as was the sweet & sour chicken.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"so don't get me wrong the place is okay, but i mean i wouldn't travel so far for it

The place is very very spread out. It was standard chinese restaurant service, a little better actually because it was so empty we got most of the attention. 

Anyways, the food just really didn't impress me, um good thing though it didn't ruin me 4 hours later...if you know what i mean...."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal! If your idea of Chinese food is Panda....... You are missing out. Service was fantastic menus is big, but they are quick to help.! I travel to China and Asia frequently and this is the closest you will get in the Valley! Be adventitious and stay away from the Americanized portion of the menu. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious eggwhite puffs with fish slices!
Also the Poached Sliced Beef in Hot Chili Oil is very tasty.

Clean place, too"}
{"text":"Pretty nice little place in what seems to be a mostly vacant shopping center. Well kept on the inside, clean, and very friendly staff. I was really excited to try this place, and per the reviews it seemed I should be. I ordered the Mongolian Beef, and I won't say it was bad, but it wasn't very good either. The rice was good, but the meat didn't have much flavor, only spice. For the price I cannot recommend this dish. My co-worker got a shrimp meal for $17, and he was very underwhelmed by the taste as well. 

For me, my rating may have been different if I had dined in depending on the service, but having ordered takeout I expected much more for the price, and the raving reviews over this place. I've had much better food at dives than this. Maybe we just chose two dishes that weren't their best."}
{"text":"We tried ordering from this restaurant tonight due to the positive rating and all we received was incredibly rude service. When providing our address they claimed we were out of their delivery service because we are in \"Mesa.\" Well the Chandler border is less than half a mile south of us and google lists us as 2.8 miles away from the restaurant, well within their range of delivery and technically even within the range of free delivery! My husband tried to explain this and they continually refused to even look up the address in their system. My husband finally gave up. 20 minutes later he was still frustrated with how rude they were and called back asking for a Manager. They put him on hold for a minute then someone answered claiming they don't speak English. Be cautious when deciding on this restaurant, it appears good service is a lottery here :("}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with a group of seven other coworkers.  It was at lunchtime, so the place was a little busy.  However, we waited about 10 minutes to be helped.  We weren't offered chopsticks, which surprised some coworkers, when we saw others using them.  

I ordered the vegetable soup and was presented with a bowl of clear liquid with three vegetables, including a piece of broccoli, a mushroom, and a piece of iceberg lettuce.  It was disgusting, I wouldn't recommend ordering it.   When the food arrived, it arrived about 3 minutes apart, so other coworkers got to watch me eat (hah).  Two of my coworkers found the \"house special\" inedible.  Another of two my coworkers thought the Szechwan  chicken was bland, when it was supposed to be spicy.  However, 3 out of 8 coworkers (including myself) thought the meal was good and would come back.  So that is a 37.5% for Szechwan Palace."}
{"text":"one of the best chinese food here in phoenix. you have to tell them to use less salt. because often times, the food just a bit too salty. other than that. it has great selection for Szechwan style food."}
{"text":"Good food. Friendly service. Reasonable price.  We stopped here because the shopping complex looked very appealing - makes you feel like you are really entering China town (a less people around though!!)! We had the szechwan chicken & chicken fried rice & szechwan pork... all dishes were good, tasty not bland and definitely filling. Sunday afternoon was fairly quiet so we didn't have to wait long to be served our food.  We will visit again to try another dish.

Customer service was adequate - waitress greeted us warmly, wasn't too talkative, but helpful when we asked questions about a dish we thought about trying.  When we were leaving,  she invited us to return and that was nice."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I have been here quite a few times and this review is long overdue.  Having been to Sichuan province, I can say this is very authentic.  To really appreciate  the true nature of the food, you should be a spice fan.  I am and the Water Boiled fish is my favorite meal.  I also think the steamed dumplings in chili oil are some the best I have had with delicate wrapping and delicious filling.  The Mao Po Tofu is quite good and my wife is a big fan of the Almond Chicken, which is not spicy but very flavorful."}
{"text":"The closest thing you'll find to a Chinatown in these neck of the woods. The Shanghai style semi spicy fish filet and pork rice cake dishes reccomended by the peppy server/owner dude was delish! Shao lung bow was average at best."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food. Order from the Chinese menu version and ask for extra spicy! This place is great!"}
{"text":"Very tasty.  Veggies perfectly cooked with the chicken dishes we had.  Excellent service.  Waitresses always around to see if you need anything.  We really liked the American Kung Pao.  Spicy.  They also serve it Chinese style which we have yet not tried."}
{"text":"Been here alot love the food.Cummin beef and water boiled beef and jalapeño beef are my favorite the waiters don't know a lot of english my seem rude at time but I'm sure it's a language thing I remember one time I ordered and the waiter was no help had to ask for everything but I didn't mind because the food is worth it and when I was leaving I did not leave a TIP because I feel she didn't deserve it and the lady at the register saw I didn't leave a tip on my receipt and she goes to the table to see if I left a tip haha and she looks at me and says no TIP? Haha I was shocked I looked her right in the eye and said Yes No Tip!!!  haha she got mad and talked to the other Chinese lady in chineses probley talking shit haha but the food is worth it"}
{"text":"After telling our friends about how awesome the Asian market was, they wanted to check out some of the restaurants. Every restaurant I've been to near an Asian market is fantastic and this is no exception. 

When we entered the place was packed which is always nice to see. The menu was huge which normally I don't like but this place has a great reason behind it - they offer traditional Chinese and Americanized dishes as well and they separate it on the menu too.

We leaned more towards the American side since it was our first time. The pork fried rice was killer -the tables favorite. The chow mein was next in line and we got just the veggie version. We had some steamed buns that were probably closer to dumplings than buns, but of course those were fantastic as well. We had some chicken dishes too that were awesome but I can't remember what we had (which is probably a good thing so  I make sure I get some of the traditional dishes next time).

Because I am not as familiar with some of the dishes, I asked a lot of questions of both the servers and the people surrounding us. I mean how else are you supposed to find out whats good if you don't ask and the right people to ask are the Chinese (I hope that doesn't come off as offensive because I do not mean it that way at all!).

For four people the meal was extremely reasonable and we got a free egg roll with our check in offer.

Next time I go, I am going to ask more questions and pretty much have someone order me something delicious and traditional so I can try new things and learn more about the food and culture. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Side note: Szechwan province is one of the best places for spicy food in China

Disclaimer: We are HUGE fans of spicy food. So unless you enjoy burning sensations on your palate, you might not like food items I'm mentioning here.

I've been here many many times with my Chinese friends and roommates, so obviously they are always the ones who order. Our typical fare includes\" a big bowl soup to share, a cold dish #1 (which means something husband and wife - includes beef tongue, stomach, etc in oil, herbs, chilies and roasted peanuts ), spicy chicken with bone in, any of spicy beef or pork dish, and some sort of stir fried veggie. 

We love the food here and think it's pretty authentic - which also means that some can be very very oily."}
{"text":"Started with a beer and a few in our group had soup, and before we knew it our meals arrived! Wow, fast service and deliciously hot food...I especially loved my Kungpao Chicken which had plenty of heat from the chiles. Huge servings and so we shared our meals with one another.
Our group enjoyed talking with each other and probably would have ordered 1-5 desserts, but instead we received our bill and fortune cookies. But anyway, we sat and talked while they continued to be sure our water glasses were filled.
When visiting here, be sure to check the outdoor display of Hanghou and Suzhou which is part of the Chinese Cultural Center; provides a nice short walk to read the historical info or to sit quietly at the small pond.
In the area there is a supermarket for everything. I shop there each time I eat at one of the establishments here."}
{"text":"the best hot & sour soup in the valley! love it...yes all caps love it!  =)"}
{"text":"25 minutes after placing my 7 PM order I received a phone call saying the restaurant decided to close early and I wouldn't be receiving my order. Terrible first impression!"}
{"text":"Favorite Chinese food in the metro area. I'm a little hard to please because I love spicy and sour potato plus Ma po tofu. Also people were pretty nice and they always remember me when I go in. Plus I recommend them to friends whenever someone is craving Chinese."}
{"text":"Some like it hot! And those that do go get Sichuan style food :) Located in the same shopping plaza as the Super L, Szechuan Palace specializes in chile and peppercorn laden dishes that turn up the heat and tingle your senses. The use of the fragrant, almost floral tasting peppercorn not only adds flavor but it numbs your tongue.

We ordered the Chongqing chicken (boneless), water boiled fish and dry saute green beans. The chicken and fish had the requisite spicy, salty bold punch to them and my tongue was numb in seconds after eating it. I was glad we ordered some sauteed green beans because it helped provide a tongue numbing break in between spicy bites. While the chicken and fish provided the spicy kick I wanted, the flavors weren't as developed as other restaurants I've been to (Such as the sadly defunct Miu's). The chicken and fish were tender though, and overall enjoyable. The green beans were perfectly seasoned and cooked perfectly. We finished the plate in a record amount of time.

The restaurant was fairly busy when we came for dinner around 8 on a Thursday. Most of the people eating here were Chinese speaking families, friends, or couples- always a good sign for good quality Chinese food. Note that while our main server did speak English, another waitress did not, so it helps if you know Mandarin or are with someone that knows it."}
{"text":"Good food, huge quantities. We tried hot and sour soup it was spicy but amazing. I ordered schezwan chicken which was good I wished veggies been cooked a little more but those who like crispy bell pepper might enjoy it. My beau tried orange chicken and he was really happy as he said it was best orange chicken he has ever eaten and he actually saw white meat which was amazing."}
{"text":"Fabulous flavorful, food with a great balance of heat, spice and complex flavors.  I ordered \"off menu\" their Szechwan cucumbers which were fresh, crisp, slightly salty with a great hot oil and many red chilies tucked into the dish.  I added a little of the table chili sauce to compliment the heat already in the dish and it was a great appetizer.  I ordered the Water Boiled Beef ... even though it came with a warning to \"some customers\" that it might be too spicy and oily ... and it was delivered bubbling hot with lovely slices of cooked beef and vegetables in a wonderful stock with a chili oil and pepper flavor that was perfectly balanced.  Heat, taste and a great texture all combined for a really wonderful entree.  This is a spicy dish without a doubt, but the warning is unwarranted as it allows the great flavors to come through and when combined with the generous portion of rice served, it is a perfect meal.  My waiter Paul was very excited about the dish and when he found out I had liked it so much, he promised to make me a \"special dish\", not on the menu next time I come in.  That will be very soon!!  The \"Chinese Menu\" is more complex as are the specials on the board coming in.  I am looking forward to another meal here shortly to keep sampling this well executed food at Szechwan Palace."}
{"text":"(The food I order here is tongue-numbingly spicy and may include parts of the animal normally eaten by Andrew Zimmern)

I don't even know where to begin when it comes to this review.  

I came here with some of my classmates one evening after class at ASU.  Luckily, two of them were native Mandarin speakers, as well as my professor having lived in China for a couple of years, so they were all business when it came down to ordering food.

Since going to this restaurant, I am addicted.  There is no other word for it.  My friend and I go at least once a week where we order the same things.  In fact, we go so often that we are immediately seated at the same table by the staff, and sometimes not even given menus.  

What do we eat?  We eat: cold noodles (liang fen), fuqi feipian (cold spicy beef tripe, tongue, and other parts), and water-boiled beef (we ask for it extra-spicy).  

After numbing your mouth, I suggest taking a sip of water OR ordering a Tsingtao beer.  You'll be amazed at how sweet tasting the beer is!

I am moving out of the Phoenix area to New England soon, and I am more than distraught that I will no longer be able to enjoy Szechuan Palace.  I've threatened to kidnap the chef, but I'm not sure he'd enjoy being stored in my kitchen.  

One of the main suggestions for this restaurant is: DO NOT ORDER THE ORANGE CHICKEN.  (hint: it's not really chinese food) Instead, ask one of the servers what the chef's special is for the day.  Or, try out one of my fave dishes.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm knocking one star because of their lunch setup. I came here today and I really wasn't impressed. They have a small menu, but that's fine. There's still plenty of good offerings to be had. The place is hectic as always, and that's nothing new. Service isn't amazing, but you really shouldn't expect for it to be. These people are *REALLY* Chinese, and I'm sorry to say that most Asian restauranteurs don't conform to the American standards of courtesy. It's a different culture, and it is what it is- deal with it. You'll probably have to wave a server down if you want something, because they won't be doting on you every five minutes. This is usually born from the fact that they have a HELL of a lot going on all at once, so don't take it personal, guailo.

Anyhow... the lunch today really wasn't amazing. It was fine, but I expect better from this place. The egg roll was just plain mushy, and that wasn't cool. The hot and sour soup was airport-restaurant quality. Now, I understand that for the lunch rush they probably just prepare an ass-ton of food in the back, and serve it to order. I get that. However, after my meal today I couldn't in good conscience give another five-star rating.

The Dan Dan noodles were good. The pork short ribs were good. The rice was mushy, but once again I think that it was just a victim of being large-batch cooked for the lunch rush. I was a *little* annoyed by the skeptical look that the woman gave me when I ordered off of the Chinese menu, but by now that shit pretty much just rolls off."}
{"text":"I hate you, Yelp algorithm. I know that I've written a review for this place before. I know that I have. But Yelp randomly deletes reviews, or something like that. Anyways...

This place is amazing. Authentic Sichuanese cuisine that will rock your socks and change your mind about what you consider to be 'Chinese Food'. China is a really big place, and unsurprisingly has many different sorts of cuisine. Sichuan province is located in the south, and tends towards spiciness. Several ingredients are used in it's preparation that you're not going to find at most other places- notable the Sichuan 'peppercorn'. It's a tongue-numbing delight that you'll definitely get to experience here with some of the dishes.

I can't even begin to recommend what you should start with. The water-boiled dishes are amazing and VERY representative of Sichuanese cuisine. Some of my other favorite are the bacon with leeks, chonqi spicy chicken wings, tea-smoked duck, and of course the dan dan noodles. Just come here with an open mind, and feel free to ask them to tone down the spiciness if you prefer. Just don't be surprised if, as a Caucasian male, you get weird looks ordering from their authentic menu. They're still not used to use guialo having a taste for the good stuff.

But they'll learn... oh, they'll learn."}
{"text":"I gave it 2 stars only because they didn't provide an authentic Chinese food to me. Named a Sichuan palace but taste like Panda Express. If it's a Panda Express I would have given this place at 3 stars."}
{"text":"Decent food... if you want \"Sichuan/Szechwan\" food you have to ask for the black menu. We noticed when Asians came into the restaurant they were only given the black menu, we had to ask for it. 

That aside, the food was flavorful and tasty, but, even \"hot\" dishes were far from hot, even though we asked for them to be very hot. 

Dumplings were a bit over done and soggy. While I've not been to china, this wasn't on par with Sichuan places I've been to in NY and other major cities. I do really want to try their 'Hot Pots' so am looking forward to go back for that. 

Service was swift and polite.   Knowing Mandarin Chinese or having a friend that knows it woudl help. 

So if you take the Szechwan part out of it, I think it's a decent place to go for what I can only guess is Americanized Chinese food in general.

The water cooked chicken had a very interesting herbal spice to it and was very pleasant with other dishes on the table."}
{"text":"Food was not good and took over an hour and a half to arrive. Poor food, poor service, very disappointed. We will not be ordering l from them again."}
{"text":"We ordered about $65 worth of take out on a Wednesday night.  It was solid, if not spectacular.  Food was ready quickly.  House fried rice was very good.  Happy family was not bad.  Sesame chicken not bad.  Wonton soup average.  Calamari with plum sauce good, but a little on the soft side (I prefer calamari crunchy).  Would go again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"If you are not up for the authentic-Chinese-with-eel-and-intestines-and-kidneys menu, do not eat here. Just don't.

This is the sort of Chinese restaurant that shows its contempt for Americanized Chinese food by cooking it badly (and very possibly by just dumping pre-fab food from Sysco into the wok, as my fried rice looked remarkably like the fried rice I'd bought in a bag at Winco last year).

My logic in trying an entrée that wasn't wildly challenging was that $12.95 is a lot to risk on a complete unknown -- but if I tried something somewhat familiar and liked it, then I'd feel confidence in branching out into more challenging dishes next time, and could thus gradually expand my horizons. (This is after determining that genuine Chinese dishes I'd had elsewhere weren't available, possibly because my faves are not Szechwan. I did try. I rather wanted certain oyster or hot-pot dishes of yore.)

Nope. There are two customers in Szechwan Palace's world: those who know and love authentic Chinese food with ingredients that do not usually appear in American cooking, and those who are so dead to taste and cuisine that they will be happy with food-service diced veg in their fried rice. No middle ground will be offered."}
{"text":"Good taste and cost effective lunch, i come to this restaurant twice these two days. Chinese should come and have a try."}
{"text":"I like giving restaurants five stars when everything is perfect and I gave this restaurant four stars but really they deserved five stars because my meal was excellent and the service was very very good. There's not much that can be said other than this is a wonderful restaurant and you should try it especially if you have several hours to just relax and enjoy a meal. The traditional Szechuan food and menu is very very good my meal was quite delicious. I had dumplings in chili sauce, egg foo young, and sesame chicken. This combination with different sauces over white rice was very very good. I would highly recommend the Szechuan Palace and encourage you to try it at your next opportunity to have Szechuan food."}
{"text":"We  go to this restaurant fairly regularly as it is close to home. The food, generally, is really good. They have a 2-part menu: Chinese food for Chinese people and Chinese food for Americans.  We've ordered from both menus but definitely prefer the traditional selections. 
What's not good is the service. There are never enough servers, they tend to ignore you more than make sure everything is fine, and generally are not very friendly.  There was a new woman tonight who was actually pretty great, but only time will tell if tonight's experience was an anomaly.  
The place is good for a casual meal and for groups as they are often accommodated."}
{"text":"HOT HOT HOT.  And did i mention hot? If you love spicy dishes full of flavor, take a drive over and have a feast.  I am writing this several weeks after my visit, so i do not remember much specifics but the dry hot pot dishes were amazing.. oh and for a tasty rare treat, get the xiao long bao.. they are little dumplings filled with meat and soup, a must try.  And that guy \"Jihan L.\" is correct about the tingly numbing feeling, i welcome it !"}
{"text":"Huge menu of both traditional and Americanized dishes. Even includes duck, lamb, intestines, and liver.

I had the (traditional) Cumin Lamb, and the taste was amazing and sort of Mediterranean. Very tender lamb, but the texture was a bit strange. Overall a bit greasy too, which my tummy wasn't crazy about. Lots of other tasty sounding dishes to try though.

Husband had (Americanized) Mongolian Beef. Beef was incredibly tender, and great flavor.

Chicken chow mein was good too. They only serve white rice, not fried or brown.

Great find in Phoenix, we'd definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Fried spicy shrimp with head on, oh yes please!! I wish they were closer so I could eat there everyday. Never a disappointment, the spice is just right."}
{"text":"So i have been there a half a dozen times, and this time the food was just OK. Times before it was fantastic. They are definitely not the most polite people in the world, but the food is 'usually.'"}
{"text":"Great prices. Tasty food. Large variety for lunch. I personally like my dishes to be cleared away. Our waiter was never rude but never came back to our table. Could be a good or bad thing but you really cant go wrong here. It was really good. I wish we would have found it 10 days ago when we first arrived. Next time for sure!"}
{"text":"Loved the flavors of all the dishes. The space is big so there was no wait. We were seated and able to order right away. There were two different menu options: traditional Chinese and American influenced. We chose the traditional route and enjoyed every bite. We ordered the combination fried rice, roasted then deep fried duck, and the garlic A Choy. The only reason I gave this a four was because the duck that we got was not cut properly or cleanly. I kept getting pieces of bone every time I bit into the meat. But the flavors were all very tasty."}
{"text":"Searched for this place via Yelp and saw that it had many reviews (over 150) and decent ratings, so my friend and I decided to try it out. 

Overall the 2 stars is due to the HORRIBLE service received. Great service is very important to me and even with good food, bad service makes it not enjoyable. I will give the short version:

Walked in, host seating us without any greeting. Waitress was somewhat nice at first- I could tell they were busy, but some attention would have been nice. Ordered our food, and my friend got his food in about 10 minutes. 20 minutes later I still had no food and when I asked, they hadn't even started. Guess it's not a good idea to ask because after this, my plate was literally thrown down at me and the grease from my sizzling plate kept splashing up. From then on, I did not even bother asking for anything further from the ladies who were in a cranky mood. 

However, they aren't going to get 1 star because the food was very good. I really wish I could have enjoyed more, but all I wanted to do was leave."}
{"text":"This is THE best Chinese restaurant in the Phoenix Metro area. Everything I have ordered is full of flavor and tastes fresh. The most inexpensive lunch for the amount of food. Everyone is nice and friendly even though they are busy and running every minute. You will not be sorry if you have lunch or dinner here. Just a heads up. Hot means hot if you love spice and heat you will get it."}
{"text":"Forget time eating lunch at this restaurant. I have to say it is well worth your money, I ordered orange chicken as an entree as to my surprise it came with a cup of soup of your choice an egg roll and a side of rice, either brown, white or fried rice. The food was made quickly and was delicious. One of the best authentic American Chinese food restaurants I have been to. Very pleased."}
{"text":"My wife and I love, love, love this place!  Since discovering it a couple of months ago it has become a weekly treat.  The dumplings in chili oil, vegetable fried rice and hot and sour soup are our regular items, usually supplemented by one other dish.

The food is consistently great.  Service is very fast and efficient, but they don't dote on you like some fine dining places.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my meal here. The Spicey Lamb Ribs were so tasty I had none left to take home as I devoured the entire order! Very good. Wait staff was very efficient. Great food, great experience."}
{"text":"Currently basking in the afterglow leftover from eating here for dinner.. A full, satisfied belly and a faint vibration coming from my lips as if they wish to continue dancing after the music has long since stopped.  

  Based on Stone J.'s glowing review of the water boiled fish I decided to go with that with an additional appetizer of pork dumplings in chili oil.. Both came out relatively fast and the presentation was superb (picture added).

  Steaming hot, chock full of spicy kick from fresh szechuan peppercorns - I had to quickly adapt to the formidable power of this food or risk perishing in the wide open space that serves it.. I gained a sort of sick pleasure from having my nose run and my eyes water, symptoms of the intensity brewed beyond the kitchen window facing the dining area.

  This filling, delicious (and seemingly pretty healthy) $18 meal was finished off with a fortune written by someone for whom English was probably not their first language, yet who clearly meant to say something along the lines of 'spread the love'...

  Glad I came, will absolutely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Someone please tell me what days to go here so I can get good service.  Reading previous reviews that mention this makes me go HUH?  My friend and I definitely did not experience even mediocre service.

We were seated within a short couple of minutes of waiting.  Our server didn't bother with small talk; went right into \"Do you know what you want to order?\"  Just like I said in my review with their neighbor Beijing Garden, I can appreciate speedy service for the patrons on their lunch break but service was lacking.  They brought out the wrong order for my friend but it was replaced with the correct one in a reasonable time.

We were never checked up on nor our drinks refilled.  We finished our lunch rather quickly but waited a long time for our check to be brought.  Realizing the time, I went up front to ask for our check and to-go box.  After the time it took to finally pay, we only had 6 minutes to make it back to work on time.  Luckily, we work very very close by and made it back on time.

Like Beijing Garden, this one is another dud.  It's a decent place to satisfy your Chinese food cravings.  However, I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent Szechuan food. A real gem. I recommend the dan dan noodles; green beans; garlic cucumbers; and spicy water boiled fish."}
{"text":"This is BY FAR my favorite restaurant in Chandler! Of course I'm relatively new to the area, originally from Tucson. But I'm always drawn to this restaurant because the servers here are so nice and the food comes out very quickly. My favorite dish is the fuqi feipian (thinly sliced beef, tripe, and tendon served cold in a Szechwan chili oil). Don't knock it till you've tried it! It's amazing! I've grown to become quite obsessed with this dish in fact. I even set out to find the best fuqi in my area of Chandler and quickly found out that this place has the best fuqi feipian. Bottom line, I will always crave the spicy, tongue-numbing taste of Szechwan and my first choice will always be Szechwan Palace."}
{"text":"Average to a little less than average.  Staff was rushed and left me to call them over to get our check.  Waitress then looked at her tip with me sitting there.  Didn't mind looking back at her while it seemed like she thought about asking for more.  

Food is average Szechwan fare.  Hot and Sour Soup is spicier and good, but missing the sour part.  Dumplings were good quality and didn't skimp on meat.  However, their sauces were bland.  Almond Chicken is servicable... just skip noticing that they use peanuts instead of almonds and that there is barely 3 oz of chicken.  Rice was a tad dry.

Meh..."}
{"text":"Man, we were really looking forward to this. After watching the Sichuan episode of Bizarre Foods the other day I realized that, while I have had Sichuan dishes before, I had never had hot pot. We usually go to the Chinese Cultural Center for Golden Buddha and had never tried Szechwan Palace.

So, the four of us headed over there with eager anticipation. There were warning signs right away. Wife: \"I'd like hot tea please.\" Waiter: \"we're out of cups!\" They were out of other stuff too. Still, we found plenty to order. Food started coming out pretty fast, one dish at a time, over a period of about a half an hour. If you want all of your food at once you would hate this, but we were sharing everything anyway, so that part did not bother me. 

But lots of other stuff did bother me. Dan Dan Noodles were good. Everything else was bland...including the hot pot. They forgot our spicy dumplings. The waiter disappeared for about twenty minutes at a time. Our table was placed in such a way that people were constantly asking me to move my chair. I could go on. Just a bad customer service experience and average food. Very, very disappointing,"}
{"text":"Cha-ching! I got lucky my first time at Szechwan Palace! I had Helen Y. with me (Jason W. was along for the culinary experience as well), and she helped us navigate the Chinese menu, explaining about Szechwan cuisine and selecting some different dishes for us to try. I don't remember everything we tried, but the two standout dishes were definitely the fish filets and the water-boiled beef. The fish was cooked perfectly, with a creamy texture and a simple, sweet flavor. The water-boiled beef was spicy and so satisfying - my sinuses totally felt clearer as I ate it! I also enjoyed the soup buns. I'm not a big lamb fan, but the lamb riblets that Helen described in her review were good and would probably be a big hit with anyone who doesn't mind the gamier taste. 

The restaurant's atmosphere isn't anything to write home about, but the service was decent and the prices (about $15 a person) were definitely really reasonable for the amount and quality of the food we tried. Thanks to Helen for introducing me to this place. When I go back with my husband (or anyone else who can't read the Chinese menu), at least I will have a few already-established favorites to order!"}
{"text":"Oops, upon looking back at my reviews, I guess I accidentally rated this place 4 stars the first time rather than 3. Have eaten lunch and dinner here several times. It's good and relatively authentic, but not fine dining level."}
{"text":"This place has really tasty food. The two times I have been there the dishes were all very enjoyable and the prices are more than fair. The women who work here as servers are almost too attentive and helpful and I've always been very happy with their service. 

Their hot and sour soup is delicoius and I've found myself craving it on many ocassions."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Phoenix I've been coming for years , my favorite dishes are the cucumber and garlic, celery peanut,  pork and bamboo shoot, salt and pepper shrimp ,  I have gotten in a rut and keep ordering my favorites and not tried some Of the more interesting items on the menu.  this place would be great for 8 or 10 people they got big round table with the lazy Susan to try a bunch of dishes .  I would love to see this place to do a monthly tasting event where people sign up in advance and all sit together and try some of the more exotic dishes and the Chef could come out and talk to the group about the meal an preparation . Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"We have been here many times (about once per month from Nov-Mar) this past winter.  We returned this year with our group expecting things like last year.  The food was still good (Kung Pao Chicken, Beef and Broccoli, and Seafood Fried Rice), the service was good.  However as we were just finishing our meals we were 'visited' by a roach crawling across our table.  Then of course we thought we could feel them crawling all over us.  We didn't of course, but did see more crawling around on the wall next to our table.  Gross and disgusting.  Pointed it out to the waitress and her comment was, \"That happens.\"  No discount, no free meal, and no apology.  Will not return.  It's too bad because the food is pretty good.  No excuse for roaches crawling around the tables."}
{"text":"Be prepared to serve yourself. Came on a Saturday, what the staff called 'after lunch' (so no specials) but the place was full. The service was abysmal for all tables. I have never seen so many people have to serve themselves water, utensils, or to go boxes. The servers seemed more focused on clearing the tables than serving customers sitting down. We got our soup, but no bowls or spoons. The entrees came all at different times, but with no silverware or chopsticks or plates for the meal. Forget more water or refills. The chicken fried rice was greasy and the spicy food had no spice at all- not even salt or pepper. Give this place a pass."}
{"text":"I ordered the \"Seafood on Sizzling Platter\" and it was fantastic.  I love the sizzling rice cake that it was served over and the shrimp was super fresh and tasty.  I did request that that they omit the squid as I am not a fan of squid.  I loved that there was such a variety of veggies and mushrooms on the plate.  

My husband ordered the Szechwan beef and I tried a bite and it was also fantastic.  It had the perfect amount of spicy and the meat was melt in your mouth tender.  They served it with plenty of sauce to soak up the delicious rice.  YUM!  We will be back !"}
{"text":"Yummy Chinese food here!

The hot and spicy soup was delicious with General tso's chicken. That is always our to go to Chinese dish.

The chicken was fried perfectly and it was nice and crispy.

I like it when it's fresh because when it's not crispy it doesn't taste the same."}
{"text":"Horrible experience.

We ordered 3 entrees. General Tsos, Chow Mein and the Warer boiled chicken.

The Tsos and Mein were decent at best. The other dish which was recommended as their favorite and is supposed to be spicy came out and it was god awful. It was Water boiled spicy beef.

We told the waitress it was unedible. It was barely spicy and had something in it that numbs your tongue and tasted like novacane. Our tongues were all numb.

No Offer to exchange it for something else. And certainly they were not about to remove it from the tab. 

Bad customer service as far as I'm concerned. 

Tip for the owners this is America, not China. Work on your customer service skills"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese food restaurant outside China. The Chef is from Chengdu, China and he cooks authentic Szechwan cuisine. When read the menu order from the part which has both English and Chinese. Try the Water Boiled Beef its tasty and spicy hot. Cumin beef, twice friend pork, spicy lamb and west lake soup are to die for. You can wash it down with cold beer. Their service is pretty good. If you are in Phoenix area try this restaurant. ."}
{"text":"Tried the kung pao shrimp and veg chow mien. Nothing great. Service was also not good. Although I did go just before it closes. Even then I asked if you guys are still serving and would have been more than satisfied if they denied service. Looking at all the reviews. I might just try it again. But for now.... NOT Satisfied."}
{"text":"I was here last night for dinner with 2 friends.
We ordered:

Pot stickers - basic
Calamari - basic. Great sauce. 
Braised duck with Conjak- really flavorful. Duck was chopped with bone; not very easy to eat but good. 

We also ordered 2 bacon dishes, one was smoked
Pork belly and one was not smoked.  Both had really great flavor and the pork was cooked to perfection. 

Perhaps some of the best Chinese food I've ever had. 

Go! Enjoy! Eat!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food and speed of service. I ordered through the app for pick up orders, which made it very easy. The food was very tasty and I will order from here again."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! The Szechwan food is spicy and appetizing. I ate so much yet my mouth still wanted more! Definitely worth a stop and try the pork intestine with pickled chili. Might not sound appetizing but I swear to you it is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I was very pleased please with this place. The food was really good and the service was excellent. The Hot and Sour soup was very good. Ordered the Szechaun chicken and was very happy with spices and heat. Served with plenty of rice. The prices are really good. I will visit this place on my next trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"The real deal - hot pots and dumplings. This has become our family go-to for authentic Szechwan. The menu has a \"Chinese\" and \"American\" sections. So If you're looking for honey chicken or sweet and sour, Szechwan Palace has it (I recommend trying the local plates though!) Food comes in mountains, and you can share between all. Flavors are all pretty deep, amazing combos. 
One star missing for strange customer service, not very attentive but decent by most standards."}
{"text":"I ordered the sweet and sour chicken. It was just alright. Reminds me of mall food court Chinese food. In the end it tasted like what a $7 meal usually tastes like. Honestly hoping I don't get food poising."}
{"text":"Wonderful for authentic Chinese food.  They offer an Americanized menu for the faint of heart along with a very spicy traditional Chinese menu with local favorites served traditionally.  No passport required..."}
{"text":"Pad Thai was okay. Orange chicken was pretty good and crab puffs was also decent, but portion sizes are terrible. Those three things I got almost cost me 30 dollars some how...."}
{"text":"I'm going to make this short.
1. This is not your typical chinese restaurant.
2. They serve Sichuan styled food, and their american menu indeed sucks.
3. If you like sichuan styled food, this is a great place to go.
Unfortunately it is not the best for anything else but they offer what they have very well (if you know what to expect)."}
{"text":"This was the worst food and the worst service I've ever experienced! The food came out exactly 4 minutes after ordering. Was hard as a rock as they had over cooked what was already made. When we asked about other options the waiter told us maybe next time we just shouldn't order the chicken and walked away. It was only after we returned the dishes uneaten that the manager came and asked what we wanted. Additionally, upon receiving the check, the waiter yelled at us to not touch it as we tried to point out how to split the check. Would never step foot in that place again."}
{"text":"If you like spicy food, this Sichuan spot has your name written all over it!  Known as one of the Four Great Traditions of Chinese cuisine, Sichuan food can be described as spicy, hot, fresh and fragrant. 

When you are seated, if you are white, they will give you the \"Whitey Menu\".  Politely ask for the \"Zhangguó cài dan\" or \"Chinese Menu\" and you will be presented with a nice, leather bound, menu filled with the best this place has to offer.  I have tasted about 9 dishes from this place and each one was excellent. 

A word of warning, their hottest dishes are the \"Water Boiled xxxxx\" dishes literally drowning in mouth-numbing Sichuan peppercorns and can be a challenge for even the most seasoned spicy food lovers.  I believe they have toned it down a bit (I was actually told this by a 10-year vetran of this spot) and the last time I had it, it was significantly less spicy, but still about a 9 - 10 on a 10pt spicy scale.  Previously it was essentially inedible to my Nordic tongue, this last time it was enjoyable.... so buyer beware.

I was going to go 4 stars, actually about 4.5, but given the fact that there is not a better Sichuan spot in AZ, it gets 5 stars.  Go, eat, enjoy."}
{"text":"Good chinese food. Luckily they have a few vegetarian options. What put me off this place was the staff. They do not understand what we are trying to tell them. They can understand our orders only if we point at the name. Though it takes a great deal to work in such a setting there is a communication problem. Service is a little slow."}
{"text":"I don't remember eating here. Strange that I checked in."}
{"text":"Saw this Sichuan place and we just have to try it. The dan dan mein was palatable but not great. We also ordered a very ethnic dish of tea tree mushrooms. A dish familiar to the region but I have not seen or tried this before. The taste was good but the mushrooms practically match the texture of miniature trees. Not sure I will try this again. The mixed hot pot was the best dish out of the 3 we ordered."}
{"text":"With Chinese restaurants, I always tell my friends that you're dining at them for the food, not the service.  Service is always secondary and to lower your expectations substantially.  

That said, the Szechwan food they make here is pretty spot on as far as authenticity is concerned.  Good use of the Ma-la seasonings and Szechwan peppercorns that give you the spiciness and the mouth numbing qualities.  

The Dan Dan Mian is pretty basic, using what I am sure is spaghetti noodles, and placing the noodles into a small bowl with ma-la chile sauce, with a tiny bit of ground pork and some greens.  Toss the noodles around and mix that sauce in well, and you'll get good flavor with a nice heat and numbing sensation from the dish.

I noticed they had a dry hot pot dish made with Tea Tree Mushrooms, and ingredient I have never seen before.  It was dehydrated and packaged before being exported for retail sales.  With this dish, they weren't able to allow enough time to rehydrate the mushrooms so that they can be a little tender when cooked.  Rather, we ended up with a dish that was well seasoned, but the mushrooms were mostly tough and chewy....very difficult to eat.  

The last dish we had was a combination dish with fish filet, beef, chicken, shrimp and vegetables (mainly bean sprouts and celery).  This dish was cooked well and had good heat to it."}
{"text":"This place Is Great! The food reminds me of our little spots in Rowland heights in California. We will definitely be returning here. We had the beef egg foo young, egg fried rice and the chicken with the flat rice noodles and the spring rolls. Every thing was a hit to us but you'll need to try it out for your self"}
{"text":"My experience here this past weekend was mediocre at best.  I arrived at the Chinese Cultural Center at about 4pm, after Dim Sum had ended at the Golden Buddha, so I decided to give this place a try with my Taiwanese boyfriend and visiting family.  The prices were a bit of a rip off for the portions that were served.  I order the vegetarian chow fun for $1 extra than it would have been as \"chow mein.\"  I'm assuming we just received the American menu, but who knows?  The service was conducted half in English and half in Chinese, which is typical when our mixed race party shows up at a Chinese restaurant.  I sampled the lemon shrimp my father ordered.  The sauce was a bit too sugary, like lemon drops, and the shrimp itself had such a thick, hard shell of batter that it was hard to taste the shrimp.  No drinks were suggested; we were left with only the water that was refilled every 5 minutes.  When we boxed up some leftovers, they did not give us the rice to take home, which makes me wary that it is being re-used.  A child was with us, and there was no kid's menu, which was a bit of a disappointment.  The food overall tasted alright, but I have definitely had better (and better service too!)  Nice try, but I'll stick with the Golden Buddha or something closer to Chandler."}
{"text":"So, after reading the Yelp reviews, I knew there were two menus...and apparently one only (the more authentic one?) gets offered to \"Asian-looking\" customers. So I wasn't surprised when partner and I were given the \"other\" menu when we walked in on a Saturday night. One thing I liked instantly about the place is that it's spacious, with enough distance between the tables, and is well-lit. The restaurant was pretty full when we came in, at about 7, but we were immediately given a place to sit. For appetizers, we got the fried wontons with mustard and hot sauce dips. I thought the wontons were a little too crispy, and I would have liked some more filling in them. The service was fast and efficient, and we got the appetizers within seven minutes of being seated. For the main course, I got the Happy Family and partner got the Cashew chicken. They came with a medium sized bowl full of steamed rice. I had picked a Szechwan place because I was in the mood for spicy food, but both the dishes lacked any fire. We actually ended up getting hot sauce to spice things up! I liked the Happy Family....the veggies, meats and sauce made me happy. The portions were good for the price, though we did manage to eat everything up! I would have liked it though, if they offered tea with their food, as a complimentary add-on. And every table should have the usual condiments...soy sauce, a variety of hot sauces....those were strangely missing here. Also, I think everyone, regardless of whether they are Asians or not,  should be given both the menus. Whether I want to eat stomach of pork in sauce or pig's feet, is a choice I would like to make!"}
{"text":"Selection of both authentic and Americanized chinese food at reasonable price. Server was very friendly and nice. She took our order for something that was not on the menu and had the chef cook it for us!"}
{"text":"Wow I just order stir fry kidney from szechwan palace, mild by the way. My mouth is on numb and my body on fire. Sweating like pig. By the way is good thing, it is being while since I found Sichuan resturant like them have in China and California"}
{"text":"Good Food, Lots of Choices, Overwhelming Menu...

First of all, I have to go back here again. There are so many things I want to try. Eating here did however require that I take considerable time to study the menu, and that I ask lots of questions. 

When I was arrived shortly after they opened for lunch, I was seated quickly, and provided a menu and water. From the moment I was seated, every minute or two someone approached me to take my order. I finally explained that this was my first time and that I needed to be left alone for a bit. Mission accomplished. No one else approached until I put the menu down on the table and closed it.

I ordered hot tea, and from their Authentic Szechwan menu, C107 - Spinach in Garlic Sauce and C124 - Yangzhou Style Fried Rice with egg, shrimp, chicken, roasted pork and peas and carrots in a white sauce (not the usual dark colored fried rice). 

My food didn't take long to be prepared, and was fresh and satisfying. The Spinach was perfectly seasoned and cooked. A nice mild dish with lots of garlic aroma and flavor in a lovely light sauce. The Yangzhou Style fried rice was not like any other fried rice I have had before, and if I hadn't read the description carefully and seen the picture, I would have been confused by it. The shrimp and the chicken in the dish were particularly delicate, moist and delicious and clearly cooked to order. The roast pork was chopped into roughly 1/4 inch cubes, and the rice was mildly flavored and had a sort of melt in your mouth texture. I needed to add a bit of soy sauce to the dish, along with a small amount of hot oil for bite, but I ate as much of it as I could. The leftovers of both dishes reheated well at home in the microwave (loosely covered).

At no point did I lack for service, with servers constantly checking back with me.

My only disappointment was that I could not try everything I wanted to, including items from the \"Americanized\" menu - such as Egg Foo Yung - which I didn't go for this time because I was a little disappointed that the ingredients (peas, carrots, meat, whatever) are all served over the patties in brown sauce rather than inside of the patties. Only onion and bean sprouts are cooked in the patties. When I go back again, I'm going to go for it and see how I like it. It was also a bit pricey, but now that I've experienced the equality of other menu items, I'll spring for it.

When I finished my meal and pushed my plates away, my check was brought immediately, along with take-out containers for my leftovers. The payment process went quickly, and soon I had my delicious left-overs in my car to smell all the way home."}
{"text":"Quick friendly service when I got takeout today--

The garlic chicken was AMAZING 


YUM


Enough said.

I'll be back for sure.

P.s. huge portions"}
{"text":"Just got home from there and am itching to write a review.  We ordered 3 dishes, water boiled fish, kung pao chicken and baby bok choy with shitake mushrooms.  We really enjoyed the water boiled fish, for valley sze chuan fans, I would say it was comparable to water boiled fish at the sze chuan place at the chinese cultural center.  The bok choy was brought out on a huge plate with a nice presentation with a good serving of mushrooms in the middle.  The kung pao chicken was okay, not quite as good as the other sze chuan palace.  

This place use to be a buffet so it's huge.  When you enter it may seem empty, but I promise the food will be worth the awkwardness of sitting in a huge room that is mostly empty."}
{"text":"Classic Chinese dishes at most reasonable prices. The dishes are not drowned in sauce. Vegetables are fresh and crisp.The flavor is authentic. Great service and helpful staff. I used them for take out, called ahead and was ready in ten minutes. Very affordable."}
{"text":"Very good food and I return all the time. I had the beef fried rice and it was great. I only wish they delivered instead of just carry out."}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch!! They have lunch combo for around $6 which includes choice of soup, veggie egg spring roll."}
{"text":"I am a recent arrival from the east coast and have not been to impressed with the Chinese food I have tried in the area, until now.  The food is excellent.   I went for lunch during the week and was really impressed with the quality and value of the lunch specials.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the abysmal service."}
{"text":"We decided to try something new and said we wouldn't order anything from the Americanized menu. The place is cute and environment was nice. As previous reviewers have said, the service is a bit lacking because there's only about 3-5 servers working. We ordered xiao long bao (dumplings with soup inside), water boiled pork, and intestine dry hot pot. the xiao long bao was really good and flavorful, those are always a nice treat. the water boiled pork has a literal tongue numbing effect and I just couldn't enjoy that dish with a numb tongue. I'm not sure what kinda spices but it was spicy and I like that this place can make some spicy, flavorful dishes. the intestines were good but there were so many peppers. overall, good place and we'll probably be back to order from the Americanized menu and stick with that."}
{"text":"Since Sichuan Cuisine is now closed, we were in the hunt for a new but relatively close Sichuanese restaurant.  So we turned to Yelp! and discovered Szechuan Palace in Chandler, AZ.

The new Szechwan Palace in Chandler is as authentic as Sichuanese style fare ever gets.  Very similar to their sister restaurant in Phoenix.  Caveat:  The back half of the menu lists many not-so-authentic dishes geared towards what some might refer to as \"American Chinese\" food, such as beef and broccoli, etc.

There are three (3) key ingredients in Sichuanese cooking:
1. MA:  Tongue-numbing sensation from the Chinese peppercorn.
2. LA:  Spicy hot heat from the chili pepper.
3. TANG:  Heated (hot) oil.... lots of tang.

This restaurant serves up all three in just the right proportions.  

This was our first visit, so we ordered the usual:  Scallion Pancake, Chongqing Chicken,  Fish Hot Pot, Sliced Pork with Jalapenos,  Sliced Beef In Hot Chili Oil,  All were very delicious.  BTW - the Sliced Pork with Peppers is on of my personal favorites and it not on the menu - but the chef graciously whipped it up for us anyway.   It was the first dish to arrive.  Yum!  

We did order General Tso's Chicken from the American Chinese Menu.  I normally don't order American Chinese food, but in all fairness, the dish was crispy and sweet.  The chicken was all white meat.  

Prices were very fair.  Entrees from the dinner menu were $8 - $10.  Service was good - dishes were cleared, tea and rice were refilled. 

There was a whiteboard listing daily specials - we'll try one or more of these next time.

I'll be back.  Soon."}
{"text":"Was good but not out of this world. Saw a few college students and business folks in the restaurant so it must be consistently good food."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on a rare Saturday work day and the service was not very friendly or responsive.  Food was ok and it seemed like those around me got better service/attention.  Really wanted to give these guys a second try but I don't think they care for my business.  Very expensive for the quality and service. It's not likely that I would be back"}
{"text":"Excellent, quiet, family-style location. I enjoy the food and the service!"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service. First off, I've found a piece of hair on my tea cup. When I asked for a new one, the waitress took her time to replace that for me. Then. it took us over 30 minutes to get the food. When we wanted the waiter to check with the kitchen, he spoke with the chef and did not even come back to give us an update on it. Waiters and waitresses were avoiding our table until the food was ready from the kitchen. Service is completely unacceptable!!!!! If we weren't very hungry when we first got here, we would have walked out. I will not recommend anyone to come here."}
{"text":"Amazing sichuan place...I used to be a regular when I was in Phoenix. They used to make the best Kung Pao Tofu... But this time, I wanted to go with my current favorite sichuan dish.. dan dan noodles. They were amazing but I shouldn't have ordered them for lunch... they were no way enough for me.

As always, the service was fast and the food was tasty. Really miss this place."}
