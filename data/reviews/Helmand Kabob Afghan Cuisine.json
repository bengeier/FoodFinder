{"text":"What distinguishes this from restaurants of similar cuisine like Bamiyam or Watan is that it's much better for dining out with a family. The interior is nicely decorated and it wasn't busy at all on a Saturday night so it was good for dine-in. It does not have waiter service like the other restaurants of similar cuisine....you get your food in trays and pay at the counter then take it to your table but that was fine by me.   The menu has the added bonus of pizza/fish which I didn't try but they seem to be well reviewed, most Afghani restaurants are missing those. The meat was from all kabobs+chicken was excellent. Their food had flavour but wasn't too spicy either so the perfect in-between. I also found the prices to be very reasonable and the quantities to be large. I'm not a big fan of basmati rice which they use instead of white rice but instead of ordering a dinner entree (meat+salad+naan+rice), you can always order a skewer of meat plus another side like stuffed bread.  Overall, I'd recommend this for the variety of food as well as dine-in atmosphere....if you just want take-out then Pamier, Watan, etc are just as good."}
{"text":"New place, the owners seem to have a pizza store mentality, probably that is what they did before.  Not sure how the service is when they get busy. kabobs and rice were not to my expectation. Over all I would at it is an ok place."}
{"text":"The chicken wrap and side order of rice is very good service is good nice interior reasonable prices"}
{"text":"~A 3.5 Stars~  There has been a lot of Afghan restaurants opening in Mississauga. So we went to try this Afghan restaurant and ordered a bunch of dishes.  Jumbo wings -10 regular Wings were served with honey garlic sauce. There are other sauces to choose from as well.   Sea bass fish dinner - Boneless fish marinated in very nice seasoning.  Wazeri Kabab - Marinated mild boneless chicken breast pieces & 1 skewer of Kofta kabob.  Tandoori Kabab - Marinated spicy boneless chicken breast pieces  Chaplee Kabab - Meat marinated with dry crushed and fresh chilies  Over all the kabab were decent and cooked well but I really enjoyed their wings. The service was a bit slow could be because the food tasted freshly cooked.   As desert we tried their Firnee, which pudding with fresh crushed cardamon and it was very tasty.  For my Muslim folks - They serve halal meat."}
{"text":"Ordered sea bass dinner this time.  Rice and fish were perfectly seasoned. Naan also was crispier this time.   I would give five stars except the service leaves a lot to be desired here.  You're supposed to pay first before you eat, but for some reason, it was just one person working who didn't know how to operate the till.  Not his fault. He's a cook. Apparently the other guy - cashier/cook was sleeping.  Granted it was 4 pm, but this is no way to run a business."}
{"text":"Came back here again and the food was just as delicious, despite some minor hiccups. This time I got the Sea Bass dinner and oh my GOD that fish was delicious and perfectly seasoned and cooked.  It was much busier for dinner than for the earlier time I came for lunch and it seems their system needs some work. You order at the counter, but it takes normal restaurant time to get your food and so you're left waiting a while. When it is busy, it's difficult to know when your food is ready and who they're calling.   My guest's meal was served about 5 minutes before mine. When mine was ready, the owner brought it to my table, apologized for the wait, and explained that the fish takes longer to cook. This is understandable and was a nice bit of customer service for sure. I don't expect full restaurant service but other restaurants have done the hybrid of ordering at a counter/being served a lot more effectively.  Also, they need music. It was eerily quiet and the atmosphere in general could use some work.  You will have no problems at all with the food at Helmand Kabob but as a hospitality professional I see little quirks that I hope will be addressed soon for an all-around great experience.  (I should also note, though they DID still have 5 bottles of cherry coke left, they were out of vanilla coke... I am scared that was a limited time thing. This would be make me very sad, if true)"}
{"text":"I came her with my family for a night out.  The location is in a dense area near the movies soo it's quiet convenient. The interior was and design was nice but some of the chairs looks like they need to be replaced.  The staff was very friendly and gave us everything we needed. Our food was fantastic I ordered the sultan kabob... BTW the portions were more conservative here which I like unlike other Afghan restaurants which all the food falls out the plate. WE LEFT HAPPY AND FULL!  :)"}
{"text":"This place has only been opened for two months. Similar to Bambiyan restaurant in Markham, however much more of a sit-down, relaxed, clean, and contemporary version.  Both of us decided to each have your typical Afghani Sultani Dinner, which was more than enough, actually it would have been better to have shared.  Their portions are satisfying! the meats (kebob & steak) were perfectly cooked, and tenderized which brought out the flare of flavors.  The rice served with the sultani had a nice hint of cinnamon which really diversified the platter which included salad, and salsa.   heres the overall: Food: 5/5 Ambience: 5/5 Service: 4.5/5 Price: 5/5  Again this place is new to the plaza, so another visit is imperative to get a better sense of how they operate when busy."}
{"text":"Just got home with a take out order and am extremely unimpressed.   Ridiculously small portion of rice compared to other Afghani restaurants. Salad didn't have ANY salad dressing on it at all, literally none. Went straight into the trash.   Tandoori chicken has a strange \"sweet\" smell and flavor to it.  This is a major, major let down considering I had high hopes for it.   Would choose Pamier, Watan, or Bamiyan without a doubt over this.   Would it kill them to use a salad dressing ??  I just don't get it  Please see my attached photos"}
{"text":"I've had better kebobs. I've definitely had better dips. And was that even a salad?!   My Order: Kofta Kabob Salad & Naan. My Review: The Kabobs weren't bad - two long, thin stick kabobs. Tasted pretty normal. We make better kabobs at home. And this is definitely not true to Afghan cuisine. The naan bread was pretty good. Nice and fluffy. The salad was a disaster - iceberg lettuce, diced tomato, onions and some disgusting dressing.   My friend's Order: Extra spicy Chaplee Kabob Salad & Naan. His Review: The best chaplee kabob in town, apparently. But then, he's never tasted the chaplee kabob my Dad makes. Hehe.   My other friend's Order: Half Chicken Kabob Dinner  Her Review: Chicken was too dry, rice was too tasteless, salad was a disaster and dips were okay.   Verdict? I'm never going back."}
{"text":"I have been to Helmand Kabob a few times over the past couple of months and enjoyed very delicious, healthy, and hearty Afghan meals every time and will definitely keep coming again and again. Most recently, I loved their sumptuous Wazeri Kebab Dinner, which consisted of succulent, boneless, yummy chunks of chicken breast (which they marinate in their special seasonings) and a yummy skewer of Kofta Kabob (delicious, lean, flavorful ground beef marinated in freshly grated spices and seasonings). All on a bed of delicious Afghan-style rice. Accompanied with fresh and crisp salad (lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc.) dressed in flavorful dressing and two kinds of yummy dipping sauces (for the meat), one is salsa-like (tomatoes, etc.) and one is creamy (I think it is made with mayo, yogurt, garlic, chives, lemon, etc.). The dinner also comes with heavenly, fresh, piping-hot naan bread, served in a rustic-style wooden basket. The naan is so good that it can easily be eaten by itself. Don't forget to grab a refreshing and yummy glass of Dough, a fresh, tangy, smooth yogurt-based beverage, a powerhouse of delicious nutrition. Orders were taken by a very courteous, cheerful, and sweet Afghan lady, who also brought the wonderful food right to my table, with a smile. Many yummy items to choose from. Large variety. The staff are all very courteous, cheerful, hospitable, and efficient. The Afghan culture is well-known for its tremendous hospitality and generosity. Very high quality food in very generous portions at very good prices. No wonder the place was packed, with many dine-in patrons as well as take-out patrons. The atmosphere is very friendly and relaxed. The interior dining and patio areas are immaculately clean and have plenty of tables. Large- screen wall-mounted television on site. All forms of payment accepted. Prime and convenient location in the Hurontario and Highway 401 area of Mississauga, plenty of parking. A few steps away from bus shelters/stops for many frequent routes (local and express) of MiWay and Brampton Transit. My sincere thanks to the wonderful staff of Helmand Kabob for making all my visits very enjoyable one and I look forward to continue dining at your great establishment on an ongoing basis. God Bless."}
{"text":"While I enjoyed the atmosphere of this place, the food was just okay!  I really wanted to take my boyfriend out for Kabob's as he is a HUGE meat lover and has never had Afghan food. Alas, we went mini-putting and wandered onto this place afterwards. I ordered the Wazeri dinner and my man had the Kofta Kabob dinner, he loved the Kabob's and the dips! I was not so over the moon about mine, the rice and salad were great but my Kabob's, especially the chicken were wayyyyyy too dry and I, like many others hate dry chicken. Especially dry chicken Kabob's, I had to soak my meat in the chili sauce just to add moisture... Really unhappy about that. I do have to say that the bread that was served with the meals was AMAZING! I ate them all...yum! They had a really doughy and lightly salted taste to it, something that was really new and exciting to me!  The staff were polite and the food was made pretty quickly, however the meals were  pricey for what they were, the plate was mosty rice, however for both of us it was a little over $30.00. Keep in mind that we both got a drink that was not included with the dinner and $3.00 each...seriously?...no combo's?  I think that there are better places out there, some that are well worth the money, this unfortunately is not one of them."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to this place. It is big and clean. The service is good and the management is very helpful and friendly. Not to mention they have a good variety of food. I still haven't tried the pizza but I am dying too lol."}
{"text":"There aren't too many Afghan restaurants in the US compared to other ethnic cuisines so I was really looking forward to dining at this establishment. Prices are reasonable for the quantity of food. I ordered the tandoori kebob w/salad and naan (w/o rice) for 10.49. Came with two afghan sauces that looked and tasted like salsa and ranch. The salsa-one was pretty spicy when added to the kebob and the salad was a good complement to the chicken. The Afghan naan did seem like reheated pita bread but It's possible it wasn't as I've only known of indian varieties of naan. I would definitely sample more items the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The food from this place is pretty good. You get a pretty decent amount for what you pay for. I got the tandoori chicken that came with rice, a salad and two dipping sauces. One was like a spicy italian salad dressing and the other was like a creamy garlic salad dressing.  When I came here my friend and I were the only ones there. If you ever order take out, call ahead about 15 minutes minimum. They cook the food to order so sometimes it could take a while."}
