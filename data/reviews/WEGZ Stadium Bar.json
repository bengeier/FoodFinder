{"text":"Food is very good and atmosphere is great.  Waitresses are very friendly but the service is terrible.  I have been here several times and the service has never been adequate let alone good. Not sure why but maybe management needs an overhaul. It's a shame about the service."}
{"text":"For a sports bar, the food is remarkably good. I ordered a stadium house salad with balsamic vinegrette (I pre-ate) and a bud light lime, and my +1 had bar size (as opposed to stadium size) bourbon bbq babyback ribs with fries and mixed greens. The ribs tasted great with a nice smoky sauce, the salad was standard with no complaints, and the atmosphere got pretty loud - not for the Leafs game, but the MMA matches that played on a few screens until the Leafs lost in regulation time.

It's a great place to watch a big game with a group of friends. There are large screens mounted all around the restaurant, as well as at the bar, so you never have a bad seat. They are accommodating with requests to keep a screen on a game or niche sport, so don't be afraid to ask!

The service is friendly, and our server came back quite a few times to apologize for the \"backed up\" kitchen and to top up non-alcoholic drinks. It took about 45min to get our two orders, which is a bit slow for bar food. In the end it worked out for us, because we didn't need to keep ordering food and drink to stay through to the end of the game.

I'd return with a group of friends to watch a game, as long as we don't need to converse with each other. It definitely gets loud!"}
{"text":"very expensive, small portions. wait time for drinks was 20 min, place was not busy at all. Additional 30 min for a small chicken club sandwich.  will avoid this place in the future. Nobody was at the front to greet you."}
{"text":"Best thing about this place besides the mega TV is the wings. Forget everything else, just go for the wings."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. The wings are incredible and worth the visit. The beer is cold and there are plenty of large screen TVs everywhere so seating anywhere will let you watch a wide variety of sports, racing, etc. 

The prices here are very reasonable given the quality of the food, service and great environment. 

It's a MUST anytime I'm in Vaughan.

There are lots of reviews that 'ding' the service but I do know that their management staff is VERY attentive to their customers needs and complaints. They will 'comp' food/drink, etc when there are complaints and do just about anything to get their customers to come back again, especially if you have a bad experience. Sometimes the server may have a bad night but this place is too awesome to not come back to over and over just because of a single, bad experience. And while I don't get up here a lot, Wegz has become my definitive favorite to visit, hangout, have a beer and watch sports anytime in in the GTA. 

I highly recommend and will return."}
{"text":"I have been to WEGZ many times throughout the years I have lived in Vaughan. I have gone for dinner, work events, and just drinks. A pattern has emerged throughout all my visits:

1. WEGZ is an awesome place to watch a game. 
2. Food is overpriced and uninspired. Not bad, but definitely disappointing for the price. I have never had a meal at WEGZ that I would go back and order again. 
3. Servers are generally indifferent and bored. Again, not rude, but kind of like being served by bored teenagers at McDonalds."}
{"text":"The Romans would be proud with the sheer size of this sports bar. You are surround 360 with big screen tvs. Excellent place to visit for a sports game. They have pool tables, golf simulator game and jitts. Decent bar food menu.
There is a police station next door, you have been warned."}
{"text":"My family and I were recently re-introduced to WEGZ.  4 out of the 6 in my family are in the Maple Lions Club, and WEGZ came to us with an idea. 

Since then we have gone to WEGZ many times and have a ball each time. The food (don't get me started) oh my god....... good, good, good. I even got the chance to spend the day with there head Chef (Mirko) man oh man can he cook, and to make it even better he is a real nice guy, If you have ever talked a head Chef before then you know what I mean when I say real nice guy, most are well lets just say......... unpleasant.

Staff, 2nd best thing at WEGZ. Real people, when the waitress comes to you and says  how is your day or something like that she means it. I find the staff \"real\" not the fake, shine you on kind of nice.... It really makes a difference being treated so well, and being taken care of. 

My club held it's end of year dinner party at WEGZ, what a GREAT time we had. Right after that event the club asked me to book our xmas and year end parties again at WEGZ.

We have come to know some of the staff by name and it is a real pleasure to see them when we go. Anne Marie, Mirko, Ryan, Lindsay just to name a few.

And if you like betting on the horses you can do that too.

Now if I can just get Mirko to give me his recipes."}
{"text":"I had heard about WEGZ before but never stopped in.  The building is huge, and I can see the attraction to coming here to watch sporting events. We initially were seated at a table as there were no booths available, however the hostess promised to let us know as soon as a booth become available.  True to her word, she returned and let us know that we could now get a booth.  I did appreciate that, as I kinda expected she would forget.   The booth was nice, complete with a large tv, and a remote to turn down/up the volume, or change the channel, which was great.  We ordered a beer each and nachos to split.  There are 3 different sizes of nachos, so we ordered the medium size one.  When it arrived, I was shocked how small it was.  The price was $17.50 so I expected a decent plate of nachos (and this was the vegetarian option).  We had to pay an additional $2.00 for extra salsa (really?).   I almost ordered additional food when I saw how small the plate of nachos was, but I refrained. Overall, I can't say I was impressed with the food, and there isn't much special about this place.  Personally I would prefer a fox and firkin, or a hole in the wall where I can get cheap beer, sufficient nachos, and watch a sporting event.  On a completely different note, I realize that these kind of bars are oriented towards men, and so the waitstaff are generally women in skimpy clothing, but I have to say, this place took it to a whole new level!  The waitstaff that I saw were not just dressed skimpy but seemingly inappropriate for a place where food is served.  Overly heavy make up, perfume, and just not appropriate.  I was turned off by this, but again, I don't think I am the clientele they are catering to, but is definitely not a place I would return to again."}
{"text":"Weak effort, Wegz. Here is a list of random thoughts and experiences at Wegz:

1. They have security at the door. What is this, a club?
2. You have to wear a paper wristband. What is this, a wet/dry event at college?
3. You drink out of plastic cups. What is this, a frat party?
4. We were at a sports bar to watch hockey and got a coveted booth. Our TV did not have high definition. What is this, 1995?
5. After sitting down nobody came to see us for over 20 minutes - we had to ask a busboy to find our waitress
6. The \"stadium size\" nachos are a pretty standard size
7. The \"stadium size\" wings (3lbs) is a total of about 18 wings (granted - they are very large wings)
8. Our waitress seemed more focused on showing us her cleavage than serving us the food and beer we ordered
9a. 30 minutes passed between ordering a 3rd round of beer / 2nd round of wings and seeing our waitress again - at that time she said both were coming soon.
9b. The beer did come soon, but another 20 minutes passed and still no wings
9c. When we told her that we didn't want the wings anymore and needed our bill so we could leave, she said \"it's a full restaurant!\" and stormed off in a huff
10. The night ended amicably between us and our server and we left a standard tip, but I won't be coming back to Wegz anytime soon.

Additional details:
- the food is average for a sports bar (not terrible, not great)
- the Leafs lost against the Canadiens. Boo"}
{"text":"First review on yelp. I don't typically review places but I felt I needed to warn people about wegz. Went there Friday night and got food poisoning. The food quality there is awful. Nobody at my table enjoyed the food. Do yourself a favour and visit a better sports bar."}
{"text":"In someones reviews they had mentioned security at the door...where were they in the kitchen eating the over priced menu"}
{"text":"This is \"the\" REAL sports bar in the GTA. 

WEGz stands for Woodbine Entertainment Group if you didn't know, so this is a ca$h money establishment, beautiful interior, large screens all over, and some booths have video game systems. There's a sports ticker to keep track of scores, champions lounge, pool tables, table soccer, golf simulators. 

I've been here on a several occassion throughout the years at all different times and it's always been good place to go to. Especially for pay per view events.

The kitchen here is top notch not the regular run of the mill bar food, with my favorite dish being the penne with goat cheese and chorizo sausage. Nachos are king as well."}
{"text":"This place is huge and always packed regardless a game night or not. They have tons of TV's and pool tables. I didn't enjoy their menu the first time but the second time it was better. Although the order comes quick to the table, the servers are not attentive at all."}
{"text":"So stopped by wegz for a drink and a bite to eat with friends.
Can't say I was too impressed.
The waitress took forever to even approach our table and even longer to bring out our drinks.
The food came out cold and I haven't even finished the meal. The only bright light of the evening? The Barmen is obviously knows what he is doing, the mojito was delicious."}
{"text":"Best Nachos in town, hands down! 

I love coming here to watch UFC fights, surrounded by hyped up crowds, and a live DJ taking song requests. The food is pretty decent for bar food, but they have a great draft selection - we usually order Hoegaarden because of the ridiculously large cup in comes in. I've also tried their Bloody Caesar, and it is SPICY! The wings are a little bit dry, and the portions not so impressive. I\"ve also ordered the combo platter, which includes hot dogs, rib sliders, mini burgers and fried pickles (see picture). The hot dogs were really 'meh' but I loved the fried pickles and mini burgers! 

Wegz is truly built like a stadium, or more so a gambling ground. There are too many TVs to count surrounding the whole restaurant, playing a variety of sports (from golf to tennis to basketball). They also have a section to play Beer Pong, which you don't see that often in bars in Toronto. You can pretty much find all forms of entertainment at this establishment - pool tables, golf simulators, betting stations, Foosball tables (Jitz), Karoake Stations, etc. 

Remember to ask for a booth before they seat you. Booths get their own TV, and the chairs are so much more comfy. Guys definitely enjoy coming here to not only watch sports and enjoy a guys night out, but also to ogle at skimpily dressed waitresses (*wink wink)!"}
{"text":"Came to this place to watch a special Leafs game. They had the audio of the broadcast on which is a plus, but the big screen are too high up the wall to further enhance the experience. It definitely has a unique and contemporary atmosphere, this place is just huge. 

Waitress came patrolling by frequently, and considering the all the bad reviews I have read, this service was great. The wait time for the food was reasonable as well. 

Now the food is a different story, ordered the special 3 pound bucket of chicken wings, and what a big mistake it was. The wings were over cooked and dried, batter and dry rub had no flavour. Worse wings I had in recent memory. 
Their fries were awful, too. 

This is just a subjective personal opinion, I very much prefer watching a hockey game in an older fashion, cosier sports bar."}
{"text":"Went to WEGZ to watch a Leafs game. Great vibe and lots of TV screens everywhere.

The food however was absolutely terrible. We ordered poutine and wings. The fries in the poutine were cold. Not just cold, ice cold. It's as if the fries were cooked a day before, frozen again, then barely thawed and reheated. The cheese on the poutine wasn't even close to melting. The only thing that was warm about the poutine was the chili that was slathered on top. The wings weren't much better. This must've been the smallest 1 lb of wings I've ever seen in my life. The wings aren't particularly large and I counted 7 wings. I asked the waitress how many wings a pound usually has and she said 8-10. I pointed out how there are 7 nor are they particularly large so unless they're just super dense wings... At $13 for \"a pound\" of wings was ridiculous considering they weren't even very good. Don't get me wrong. I'm willing to pay $13 for wings if they're good but this definitely did not live up to its price tag.

In terms of service, our waitress was friendly enough. Perhaps she got too friendly cause as she walked by, she had me hold on to some dirty dishes for her as she delivered the food she was carrying in her other hand. Didn't realize I was part of the staff now!

All in all, I'd go to watch a game or grab a drink but never again will I eat there."}
{"text":"Came here for the Super Bowl (yes my review is really really late!) 

I had gotten advanced tickets and also came
here again because I had a blast Super Bowl 49! 

We sat in the corner at the back so we could see the big screen (but we weren't in the actual room with the big screen)

I thought these seats would be better than the high top at the bar we had last year, but those seats were definitely better. 

We were sitting next to a VERY rowdy group of guys who I feel needed to be tamed - we barely
had a server come over, let alone didn't see any of the bud light girls who were giving away free things - last year we ended up winning quite of a bit of small items.

I felt a manager should have came by and assisted to control the noise and belligerent behaviour of the individuals - we had an individual with us who was pregnant and they weren't careful at all, continuously knocking into our seats and spilling their beer everywhere. We had mentioned it to the server but I could understand why she didn't want to control the situation on her own - however nothing we done about it. 

Food: some of our food came out cold that we actually had to send it back, not sure if it was sitting there for a while or if it just wasn't cooked properly because of how busy they were, but you'd think they'd prepare well for a major event like that. 

I'm glad we got our money's worth since we had to buy tickets in advance."}
{"text":"Following the lead of my fellow Yelpers, I was recently brought in here for dinner and drinks with a crowd of Yelpers for Yelp Eats (charity program where depositing your $30+ receipt into a marked bag leads to a $10 donation being made by the restaurant).

Our group of 5 was excited that this would be the kick off location for the program and it was nice that WEGZ wasn't overly busy on this Tuesday night as it gave us a chance to Bro-out whilst watching nail biting election coverage and another loss by the Toronto Raptors.

WEGZ is magificent for those who have never been. Before there was Real Sports in Toronto WEGZ was the epitome for sports bar big screens, big bar and well....big everything. It's literally what every guy wants as his personal man cave: Foosball, virtual golf/soccer, pool, big screens, sirens that go off when teams score during a game! Literally the works!

Once we were seated we knew that from a combination of previous experiences and yelp reviews there would be no hesitation on what we were going to be ordering to start. The Beer Cornucopia itself aptly named - THE BREWTENDER. 80oz of beer contained in a transparent contraption armed with a center ice column for keeping beer cold without watering it down, a spout for easy pouring and enough beer sex appeal to get my motor running. What an amazing invention...Sorry Boston Pizza but no longer will I suffer through one of your rapidly warming team pitchers. WEGZ's Brewtender is the shizznick!!

It would be great if the brewtender came armed with an expansive selection of beers, but unfortunately past the basic (Molson and Labatt) selection the only standouts on tap were Amsterdam Blonde and Rolling Rock.

On to the meal, our server was very patient as we tapped into our first...and then second 80oz of beer - yep we downed 160oz! But when it came time to order PO-Boy nachos were the appy order of the day to share. I made a comment to my companions that this was a really well made CHO, layered nicely and never a dry chip without either sauce or cheese on it. Stadium sized this proved to be a monster of an undertaking - thankfully there were 5 big strong men on site to work on this ;) Mission accomplished. 

For my main course I order the chicken club which was a welcome surprise from the normal version. A whole chicken breast and hickory smoked bacon made this a meal and not just some 1/2 assed deli mess. The bun, while it appeared thick and able to hold it together...failed to do so and I ended up eating the second half of the sandwich with a fork and knife. Not a fan. But over all the taste and make up of the sandwich over came the bread issues. 

One note that I hope will be improved is the side caesar salad. It was bland and had almost no dressing on it. In fact there was even water at the bottom of my salad bowl. Hoping this was a one off as I had ordered their chef salad on a previous visit and that was lovely and perfectly well made."}
{"text":"I have to say  I am not normally someone who jumps on the sports bar scene just because its football season. I would rather sit at home, drink my own beer and give my trucker mouth free reign without worrying about offending someone.  Well, last Saturday the Green Bay Packers were playing and a couple of friends were going to Wegz, and naturally first thought was \"sounds lame\", but I try not to judge it before I try it. 

First of all, the place is huge and has ample parking, bonus... yes!  

Score 1 point. 

The entrance makes you feel like you're walking into a stadium (alright that's cool) and the atmosphere was upbeat and fun. But it was a football night and I think, with the right people, a football game is good regardless of where you are watching it.  

One thing that set Wegz apart from other sports bars was the shape of the bar, which made watching the game possible for everyone. They had a HUGE TV (ceiling to floor) big enough for everyone in the bar to see. 

Score 1 more.

For those of you who have read my previous reviews, I like bench seats. This place did not have enough, especially near the big screen. It was mostly backless bar stools. At that time on a Saturday night, after working all day, I rely on furniture for bodily support. So I found it was really hard to relax.

Sorry, they may look classy but comfort means a lot.  Lose 1 point.

The menu was a basic bar menu, most bars provide the same stuff. As for the beer menu, they sold Guinness on tap. Smile. 

Score 1. 

As for the service, our server came every 25 minutes. And we had to order the same pitcher twice. Boo.

Minus 1.

For dinner we ordered the prime rib sliders and chicken quesadilla to split. The quesadilla was really good. But, the fries were cold and the prime rib sliders could have had more meat and less bread. 

When it came time for the bill the waitress charged us for a pitcher we never received. As a previous bartender, this annoyed me greatly. And when I inquired about the extra pitcher she  accused me of not knowing how the Maitre-D ordering system works and implied that we had no clue how much we drank. 

Come on man! You just lost 3 points.

My inner monologue was on fire but my conscious remind me; \"Tiffany,  be nice to everyone, especially who are just not as smart as you\".  So as the stone -sober designated driver, I spoke with the waitress and asked her to take the extra pitcher off the bill, \"please and thank you\", of course! 

The night was a bit of a write off for me. The Packers losing didn't help. Also, I don't like when servers put up a fight and treat customers like they're slow.  On top of the neglectful service, our servers poor attitude and the unoriginal food, I don't know if I will go back. 

I'm sad to say that just like the Packers, Wegz did not have their game face on. 

I would say Wegz is maybe a field goal,  but definitely not a touchdown."}
{"text":"The food here is terrible.   period.  The service is mediocre.   The big screen TV's are good...but honestly the layout isn't so great....be prepared to have a sore neck, and sure you'll get a sore neck from some of the eye candy, but mostly from trying to see all the games.    Wouldn't recommend this place normally, but if you wanna go out and watch monday night football or the Super Bowl, go for it......just don't be surprised if your overpriced food is terrible."}
{"text":"My favourite place to watch a game.  Atmosphere is great when Leafs are on especially if it's the playoffs! Have to get there early on important game nights...even the massive stadium bar gets full! Have seen a couple of Super Bowls here as well and it was great...lots of prizes and service was up to par.   Food is good for a sports bar....Can't go wrong with their wings!"}
{"text":"Good place to watch a game with friends. I like the beer tubes for your table - you don't need to chase someone down every time your glass is empty. You even have your own TV if you sit at a booth. Food is average so would not suggest this as a destination for food alone. It's all about sharing a great game with other sport fans. Service is generally good but I find the kitchen a little slow so put your order in early. Unless you live in the area, it's a little out of the way."}
{"text":"It is probably the best sport bar in the GTA, the location and TV setup is as good as it gets, their food is also really good. They do need to work on their service though, waitresses seem to be confused a bit and run all over the place!"}
{"text":"Went here for a friends birthday. Great atmosphere OMG! So impressive. Hot waitresses. The downfall here was the food. It wasn't what I expected being in what seemed like such a big production of a restaurant. But the fun times and the atmosphere made up for it.

Randomly we met one of the guys from B4-4 there. The girls I was with recognized him. Should I feel bad that I was the only person not bugging him for a picture and autograph? His girlfriend was cute though. Haha"}
{"text":"First off, this place is HUGE and in a plaza so perfect spot to bring a group to watch a game (tons of seating and multiple tv's). 

Some notes: 
- Our server was nonexistent after our food was delivered - did not do a check to see it was okay or come back to take more drink orders. 
- Ordered chicken parm sandwich and fries. Fries were pretty good. Chicken parm came with a side portion of marinara and at first, I didn't know why... Until I bit into it. 
THE SAHARA IN A SANDWICH. :( 
Needless to say, I had to drench that bitch in sauce. 

I'm not sure why the server became so agitated but she literally snatched the credit/debit machine out of my hand about half a second after I finished punching everything in. 

Added to that, her hair was in that messy knot on top of her head drunk girls do at 1AM. I was a server for years, including at sports bars similar to this one and from what I recall, the waitresses that work in such establishments should be hot, all the way to the end of their shift. I'm not into girls so that's not where this remark is coming from, more so from a standpoint of caring about representing your workplace... 

I'm sure I'll be back since the guys love it, hoping to have a better experience with service."}
{"text":"Just went in on the weekend..and my buddy who is a chef said and i quote,

\"Best Ribs I have ever had\"

I tried them, and i agree!!!"}
{"text":"WEGZ is always on my \"be sure to stop by list\" when I'm in the area on business. I only wish we had a venue, exactly, like this in Austin... Great beer selection, good food, nice service, games, betting and a million TVs. The only ding it's on the pricey side but the food is good and the beer is cold so..... We ordered the calamari appetizer and was looked to perfection. My fish and chips, one piece, was a huge piece of haddock that was more than enough. It was also fried just right..moist but with crunchy batter. The other guys had burgers and they were cooked as ordered... It would be tough to go elsewhere to catch a game with WEGZ in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Food isn't that great and the pricing is so expensive. You can find better for cheaper in the area."}
{"text":"Probably the best place in the burbs to catch the game. 

Wegz is massive! I came here last Tuesday for \"yelp eats for hunger relief\" and I must say this place was pretty impressive. TV's everywhere, basically no matter where you are seated you will be in clear view of at least 3 TV's, there is even a decent sized flat screen in each booth! There is also a very large screen at the back if you want to see the game in gigantic form. In addition to TV's there are pool tables, virtual golf, and foosball, making this a great spot to have some fun. Are you a degenerate gambler? Well then Wegz is also the place for you, they have off track betting if you want to put some money on a pony or you can play a lotto ticket at the front desk. I've never seen a lotto stand at a bar, I suppose that's a plus (it made sense once I was told that this place is owned by the same people as woodbine horse track). 

This place is more than every guy's man cave dream; the food is actually pretty good. The group of us 5 guys shared the stadium sized shrimp po boy nachos. These were massive; I would suggest you have at least 4 people to get this size. The nachos were layered nicely with lots of cheese and toppings, the breaded shrimp was ok but not great and all the cheese made them slightly greasy, overall they were above average. For main course I had the chicken club with sweet potato fries. The chicken had a nice grilled flavour and a generous amount of cheese, the bread however was falling apart and I suspect is was not very fresh. The sweet potato fries were pretty good but nothing out of the ordinary. The menu as a whole is concise with bar classics as well as some lighter fare. 

My absolute favourite thing about this place is the 80oz brewtenders, this is great for sharing among your friend and makes for a funny photo-op. On a busy night I could see the brewtender coming in handy as you would not have to keep bothering your waitress for a refill. The beer selection was less than impressive however; just your normal big names with one local brew (Amsterdam blonde lager).  

The service was quite attentive and the waitress was very friendly. The place was not busy at all on a Tuesday night but I suspect they are pretty busy on weekends, for hockey games, or on a UFC night. This place is pretty laid back and I would watch a sporting event here any day. Outside of real sports downtown this is the best sports bar in the area."}
{"text":"This place had exceptional staff, the environment is amazing and the drinks are strong. They win points in my books for not charging a cover fee(given that it was fight night) and I was allowed to sit at the bar all night, while not really ordering anything,after I got lit.The TV's make it a great place to watch a sporting event(I watched GSP dominate), not to mention the pool table, and other features they have. This place was a bit of a drive for me, but totally worth the trip. I mean can you imagine taking a drink from a whisky and coke and tasting way more whiskey than coke. I've never experienced this in my life, but this is how bartenders should do it! the amount of alcohol used made it easier to get tipsy off of two of their fairly priced whiskey(s) paired with two beers. Amazing night. Definitely found my new spot for fight night(s)."}
{"text":"If you are into sports this is the place to be.  This place is HUGGEEE.  Lots of things to do.  Pool tables, Foose Ball tables, Virtual Golf, Horse betting and just7 about every sports game is being played on the many many screens through out the hole bar.  There is a live DJ free give away's during leaf games.  A great place to be to watch any game especially any Toronto teams.  There have booths with your own personal TV's as well which gives you options to watch what you please.  For those of you that don't know WEGZ is owned by the Woodbine Entertainment Group which is why you are able to bet on horses and also play your lottery.  As for the food it typical bar food.  Not a huge menu but does the job.  Burgers, wings, nachos, sandwiches, pizza and a few entrees.  Not the best in the food dept but not bad to say the least.  The service is a little slow but 99% of people that go to WEGZ are not in a rush to leave so the slow service is not that much of a bother.  If I could I would give the venue 5 stars and the food 3 stars but in a whole I think 4 stars is fair."}
{"text":"went with a group of friends to watch NBA playoffs, the atmosphere is amazing, food was good, drinks were okay ( would rather more selection)- I would definitely return for date night or with my family"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Lovely staff. Food and drinks came out on time. If you don't want wings come here the menu is great and lots of TVs!! Amazing place to chill on a Friday night because of the games and pool table"}
{"text":"Food can be good at times but when busy the food quality suffers.  And so do the servers. Used to go very often but in the last year I have not gone back because of these reasons."}
{"text":"Food takes quite a long time....ended up cancelling my order.  Drinks and the atmosphere is decent however and is what would be expected of a sports bar."}
{"text":"Top marks for atmosphere and site lines of you are there for any sporting event. That said the food prices are a bit high compared to other spots. Over 35 bucks for 24 wings just doesn't make sense but then again maybe they buy different wings than everybody else. 

My reco is stick to a shared app and beer unless someone else is paying. 

As for service, it's very good. I have never had a problem with that."}
{"text":"Me and my wife wanted to catch the soccer game and there was no where better to watch a game than Wegz. it was noon and we wanted to have some brunch food but it wasnt in the menu for some reason yet they managed to get us some decent eggs, bacon, sausages etc. 
This improvised brunch wasnt great but I give them praise for accommodating us and serving us with brunch."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.... you can't NOT look at a tv almost and they got some great beer on tap, had a few appetizers and the all were quite good. I would think watching a UFC event here with a large group would be super badass. Check this place out, i'mma go again for sure!"}
{"text":"Went there to watch a game with friends. Very nice place. Nice atmosphere. Polite and friendly staff. The french onion soup very good.  Nachos very good. Big portion with lots of cheese. And the bison burger and sweet potato fries were delicious."}
{"text":"Was here last week for an event....haven't been here in YEARS and didn't even know it was still standing!  It's a huge place - great for watching sports.  It def does not have that grungy and grimy feel to it.  If you are looking for a dive-y bar...keep on driving! 

I wonder if they have Survivor night (not that I watch it anymore) or maybe even a walking dead night..watching it on the big screen...might be fun!  The food is decent and the staff is great!  But since this place is on the opposite end of the world for me...I probably won't be going back anytime soon...it's just too far."}
{"text":"Love the drinks, nice place to hang out with friends especially  if there's a sports game :)"}
{"text":"Seen one sports bar seen them all right? No you are wrong, so very very wrong. Wegz is something epic. Ridiculously epic. I don't even know where to start! It's that crazy. Check out the website if you don't believe me. 

They call it a stadium bar and for good reason. This place is HUGE! 23,000 square feet huge! Fits 800 people easy. It looks like a bloody stadium! There are insane amounts of large T.V.s going on in here, well over 50, they even have em in the bathrooms, and a huuuuge sports ticker that circles the entire stadium. It makes the ticker outside the TSX look like crap. Walking in I was astonished. There are pool tables, bowling, Foosball, a huge bar, AND A GOLF FUCKING SIMULATOR! TWO OF THEM. WTF?

The food here is actually very good considering it's a sports bar. Much better than you would get at your typical sports bar. They have this thing that is called a Beertender and its basically a giant clear keg, get it it will ensure a good time. The servers are friendly, helpful, attentive, and gorgeous. The only thing odd about this place is the amount of women that consistently pack this place. Being a sports bar it's rare to see a 3:1 girl:guy ratio. 

Overall, this has got to be the best sports bar in Ontario hands down and even the best in Canada. I've never seen anything like it. Prices are good, beer is plenty, food is good, and the experience is something else. Come here for the game.

Check the website and you will see what I'm talking about. It's fucking crazy. The music on the site is pretty bomb too."}
{"text":"The good: This place is huge and has lots of TVs.  If you're here to watch major league sports, UFC, what-have-you, and don't much care about anything else, this is a good place to go.

The bad: The service was less than accurate, less than timely, and less than thorough.  There with a group of 8 this past Saturday, our waitress improperly recorded 2 orders, and each of the meals came out at a different time.  Water was requested and never arrived.  Drinks were ordered that arrived a half hour later.  Empty glasses begging to be refilled or reordered sat empty for a half hour before our waitress would notice, and another half hour before she'd ask the patron if he or she wanted a refill.  We were also seated at an awkward set of tables that weren't conducive to conversation among the entire party - in a venue that, on a Saturday night, was only half-full, if that.

And, a personal pet peeve of mine: only a single cider available, and two drinks were \"sold out\".  Yes, really.

The ugly: The shrimp tacos fell apart; the deep-fried shrimp were stale and cold, and the fries unbearable.  The wings were skimp for want of meat, the tenders not so tender.  And still, this full-service bar doesn't know what goes in a real Long Island Iced Tea (but should I really be surprised? It seems no one in this city does.)  The foosball table was out of order.  Pool tables were expensive and nickel-and-dimed for those who took a minute over their allotted hour.

Overall: while I appreciate the spaciousness of the venue, the variety of food offered and the potential here, the service and execution were terrible.  Will not return, would not recommend."}
{"text":"My very first Yelp Elite event brought me here yesterday:)   The event itself was very successful.  The atmosphere was good.  All yelpers there were very friendly.  Thanks to Kris for organizing such a great event!

The sports bar is the biggest and the most spacious one I have ever been to.  It has a very high ceiling to accommodate a very huge theatre size HD screen.  There are other big TV screens all over the place too.  It is so cool to watch sports on that giant HD screen even though I am not a big fan watching sports.  Besides, this place is like a big game room.  There are two golf simulators, several pool tables, and some table soccer-like games.  The washrooms are well maintained.  I just find that the drink list for beers is sort of limited.

The servers at the event were very nice.  Thank you for serving us around with very awesome food and snacks.  The pull pork and meat ball mini sandwiches were delicious.  I did not get a chance to try all desserts.  The only mini tart I tried was not bad at all.  

I will definitely come back to try this place again."}
{"text":"It's a huge place. Came here during the raptors game. It was packed. Luckily we didn't have too much of a wait to be seated. They were extremely busy. Just like all the reviews, the tvs are huge in this place, you can definitely catch the game from any seat. 
We got the poutine and wings to hold us over, and they were actually satisfying.
I would definitely head back."}
{"text":"The quinoa veggie burger is the best restaurant veggie burger I've had! Fries were perfect too. Fun place!"}
{"text":"I was not happy with my experience here for a few reasons. Firstly, the service was extremely slow. It took 20 minutes to get another round of drinks and the waitress appeared very annoyed with all our requests. She seemed very unhappy and clearly was not interested in serving us or helping make our night enjoyable. I understand people have bad days but when I go out, I really hate feeling like I am bothering people, especially when I am paying for something. This really brought down the mood of our table - especially since the drinks were running dry. The food (which took way too long to arrive) was nothing special and my friend's meal was cold. Although this seemed like an impressive place to go watch the game, I was left very disappointed. It seems a lot of effort was put into the look and atmosphere of this sports bar rather than on the quality of food and customer service - which I think is equally (if not more) important. If I go here again, it won't be for good food or more than one drink."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Wegz, and first I'd like to say the atmosphere and decor was amazing. Definitely a perfect place to be during a big sporting event as there's literally tvs on every inch of this place. The food, however is definitely over priced for what you get. As a group of 6, we ordered the nachos and quesadillas to start. Both were good and exactly what you would expect of typical bar food. I had ordered the burger which was mediocre. It tasted like a backyard BBQ burger but way over cooked and dry. Couldn't finish. Our server was great and very accommodating to our group. 

Overall, this is a good spot if you want to watch a game with friends and have some drinks, but the food is too over priced. Not a bad spot, but definitely room for improvements."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place far too many times to count, so a group of 4 of us decided to pop in on a Friday night to see what all the fuss is about. We got there at around 8:00pm and considering it was a Friday night it was pretty quiet (although when we left at around 10pm it was starting to ramp up a bit).

Venue - the place makes you feel as though you're actually at a stadium. It's cavernous with TV screens everywhere, games to play and definitely a place to people watch.

Food - I found the food to be overpriced for what you get. One of our group ordered a steak sandwich on a baguette - it arrived and we thought it was a joke...it was very tiny for the price they were charging and was really a disappointment taste wise. 2 of us ordered the \"southwest Burger\". It to was a bit of a disappointment - the meat portion was great (moist with a great flavour to it), however the stale bun and complete lack of heat (for something called \"southwest\") left a lot to be desired. They really need to reconsider the egg buns they use. The 4th person had a salad...it was massive and she couldn't finish it. We all agreed that we've had better food at other places. Price vs. quality was weak.

Service - The server was definitely friendly and inviting, but we went long stretches without him dropping by to check on us. Dirty plates sat far too long in front of us, empty glasses not refilled, etc.

BIG ISSUE - we ordered a round of \"stadium nachos\" as an appetizer. After about 20 minutes we all started to comment on how long it was taking to get it. A few minutes later our main courses arrived. I mentioned to the person who brought out our food (not our server) that we had not yet received our appetizer. She asked what we ordered and said she'd find out where it was. About 2 minutes later our server dropped by and said that he had forgot to punch the order in. He then said he would place our order now, so that we could take it \"to go\" with us. We declined because:
1) having an appetizer AFTER your meal makes no sense at all (at least to us) 
2) we were all going in different directions afterwards
3) soggy nachos are not our idea of a great \"after meal\" snack.

Summary - great venue, so-so food, friendly if not \"on the ball\" staff. Disappointing visit."}
{"text":"My Order: Beeeeer......& loads of it (you really can't go wrong w/ beer) 

Pros:
+ this venue is HUGE; as a basis of comparison very FEW bars offer such a large venue for watching sports, games, etc. 
+ you can literally turn in any single direction and there will be a big screen right in front of you; it's hard to miss any of the shots with that amount of detail and HD quality
+ bars are scattered across the entire stadium bar so I can't imagine you'd have to walk too far (or wait too long) to get served
+ private parking lot
+ tons of pool tables throughout the bar (as well as game tables) 
+ Golfing simulations! Literally this bar integrated almost all sports into this single stadium. 
+ I came here once for a yelp event. I didn't realize that you could get classy-fine dining appetizers here: THAT IS AWESOME! 

Cons: 
- I wouldn't necessarily call this a con but it can get quite rowdy; but really, take into consideration where you are, it's a bar. 

Honestly, the size of this venue is massive; very comparable to Dave & Busters. I really wish that I could critique the food but I've only ever been here on two occasions; a yelp elite event & a bar crawl/friend's birthday. 

I imagine the food was specially catered to the yelp elite event but here's my verdict: very fresh, very rich in flavor. We got little appetizers of desserts (mousse) as well as pulled pork sandwiches, vinaigrette salads. It was very surprising, given that it's a bar."}
{"text":"I echo Jon O.: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/wegz-stadium-bar-vaughan#hrid:EZx1DfYCnh2tXAud0hBwuQ

Bullshit."}
{"text":"Been to wegz just a couple of times, I like the environment, very big and spacious. Very good environment for watching any kind of sports! 
The crowed is a nice mix, service is okay depending on the time and day! Don't expect too much on a busy night"}
{"text":"Wegz is a great place for sports and beer. The food is decent enough but very pricey for what you get in my opinion. You're paying for the experience I find more that anything. The service was fantastic and the food came quickly. Our waitress was kind and friendly."}
{"text":"This is probably the shortest review I've made so far because they didn't leave any good impression.

I was here with my sister and some other girlfriends because it was the only place that opened during those late time (AllStar closed). We got our table right away and started to order food. The waitress was cold and unhelpful. 

We orderer pizzas and soft drinks because we had drunk before that. The pizza was cold, soft, and bland. We didn't bother to ask them to change because it was late and we were both hungry to wait for another one.

They were busy talking to guys at the bar section. I wasn't impressed with both food (overpriced as well) and services.

Whenever I come by this place I still feel very irritated lol."}
{"text":"Nice place, spent a few hours here watching the basketball game.  Bought some wings, drank some beer.

Wasn't too busy when i went, the bar was separated into a few sections, i sat in the section with the big screen.

I like the nachos here, one of my favs, its huge portion and can almost fill me up even before I even got the wings.

Service was nice the waiter and waitress was hanging around all night and asked us if we needed anything."}
{"text":"Food is ok. The service here is terrible. Takes an hour before a waitress comes. Other servers that came to get plates after were not friendly. No smile no hello....nothing. I won't be back. It's a shame and no wonder the place is dead."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin. I went today around 7:30PM and it wasn't crowded yet... 

I was blown away by the interior design. I felt as if I was in a Las Vegas hotel with TV screens in every wall big and small. I went with my boyfriend and a friend because we wanted to catch the NBA All Star show. We were seated quickly. While we were trying to get our heads around the place we were very excited to watch the game on the big screens. They had many different sports shows on, gambling areas and booths for parties. Overall, the interior was the best part about this place. 

Now.. On to my experience. It was horrible. We were seated and it took about 10-15 minutes for our waiter to return to finally take our order. My boyfriend and I ordered the Tempura Zucchini and veggies to come out first for an appetizer. For the main I got pizza and my boyfriend got a hamburger. While we're were talking and getting amped up for the NBA we started to notice how busy it was getting and that the tables beside us were getting filled. After about 30 minutes of waiting our waiter comes out to tell us our food would arrive in 3 minutes due to problems that weren't disclosed. (BY THE WAY WE WERE SITTING AND WAITING NO WAITER COULD BE SEEN) We waited another 10 minutes until my boyfriend got up to look for someone to talk to. He went to the front to talk to one of the girls greeting people and told her our situation. She told him it was because they were busy that things were backed up. Literally an hour passes by and the three of us sat at the table watching the people around, who came AFTER us, eat their food!!!! How and why??!! We were so hungry and upset that we finally found our waiter who told us that our food was actually given to the wrong table and that we had to wait longer for our food to be prepared again. The manager also came out to talk with us and said it was because it was busy. 

I totally understand that it's busy.. But you have X amount of tables here with seats. I think as a business that they should have anticipated this. Especially because it is the NBA All Star weekend. 

Although our waiter was nice he was often times forgetful and would come to us asking if we needed anything when we had given him an order of water or a beer. :/ 

When the food did arrive it LOOKED great. But when I picked up my tempura veggies everything fell apart when I dipped it into the sauce. It was soft and felt as though it had been sitting around for awhile. 

The pizza was plain... Nothing special. I got the Caprese pizza it was extremely dissatisfying because of how underwhelming it was when it came out. Someone just threw on a few tomato slices, cheese, basil and drizzled -- very stingily -- some balsamic vinegar. Don't waste your time and money on this. 

The hamburger was a veggie burger with sweet potato fries. Veggie burger was good but I believe it was cooked on the same area as other meat foods because it had a very strong meaty taste. It doesn't come with condiments so don't forget to ask for it!! They brought it out to us without any condiments.. So strange. Sigh. Finally, the sweet potatoes. Also avoid, it looks good but tastes undercooked. 

In the end.. I don't think I would go back for food. I would perhaps go for drinks for big sports games because it has a great atmosphere. 

You can never go wrong with alcohol right?

{"text":"GOOD: 
Good Sports Bar to watch sport events as they have a lot of TVs and Screens in different sizes, from personal to Stadium size Screen

OK:
The food, some of the food is solid like their sandwiches and some appetizers, stay away from their wings and main dishes! 
The Bar, all the drinks are fine, good selection of draft beer.

BAD:
Service, the service is absolutely horrific, one of the worst in any place we have been to, they never bring cutlery, rarely bring plates for appetizers, it takes minimum of 50+ minutes to get any food and its even when the place is half empty!"}
{"text":"Best place to watch a big sporting event; whether it be the Raptors playing in the playoffs or the Super Bowl. Everyone is friendly and really into the game. Food okay, a little pricy but that's what you'd expect at a bar this size. They have pool tables, a lot of tvs and golf simulators. If you're coming for a big event try reserving seats cause it gets packed pretty quick!"}
{"text":"Sports bar sort of like another version of the Dave and Busters in Canada. Beers and bar food mostly and they open late. Food is mediocre but we go there often for convenience."}
{"text":"My third wife, Samantha, left me because I was such a WEGZman. 

but you know what? it was worth it.

food, service, ambience: WEGZ has it all, and then some. find me there, literally slathered in wing sauce, as i stare defeated into the middle distance. my soul has sailed to distant shores and witnessed only worry, felt only pain. WEGZ is my respite from the clamour of the waking world, the only place in Vaughn where my melancholy can claim asylum."}
{"text":"The food here is very pricey and not good at all. I ordered the nachos and a pound of wings. Honestly the worst wings I've ever had, barely Any meat on them and the nachos were just plain bad, not worth the money... this place is ok if you're jus there to watch the game and have a few beers but I wouldn't go to grab a bite"}
{"text":"One of the best sports bar in Vaughan/GTA, there is always something to watch, and if you're looking for a specific game, 100% you'll find it there!

I've been there so many times and never once Left disappointed.

On big games' days, it's highly recommend that you go early or call for reservations, but they always only take reservations for about 50% capacity and leave the rest for walk-ins at first come first serve.


They cool booths where there used to be a playstation or an xbox station, with a couple of controllers..

They also have a virtual golf game, virtual racing track, bids/lottery station..

On top of having tens of screens everywhere, they have a giant screen where normally big games screen on.

On bigger soccer games (world cup and such), and specially on days where Italy plays, they sometimes host an open buffet with a surcharge, which gets pretty busy and wild!!

Highly recommended for big groups, you will have a great game while enjoying great food and your favourite game(s)."}
{"text":"Wegz stadium is the ultimate men's paradise! Loaded with TV's all around the restaurant,  above the bar,  even your own TV when you sit in a booth! 

Not only they Have amazing atmosphere for every game,  the game goers +1 can also play some golf,  soccer or even bet on horses.  They also give away weekly prizes!  Le bf and I won a pair of leaf tickets on vday! 

We didn't have a chance to try any of the food out. But definitely 5 stars for atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Came back to WEGZ to catch the closing ceremony of the Olympics. 

What a difference this visit as the bar is almost empty! A little too quiet but at least I can sit wherever I want, I can get services and a good view of the screen.

Drafts selection is decent with almost the whole line up of Keith's, Rolling Rock, Amsterdam's, Stella, Guinness and Hoegararden.

If with a group, definitely get the Brewtender (80 oz) to share! Just love those beer towers!!!

Great places definitely is a great place to chill with your friends with or without catching a game! Maybe next time I will order some food to go with my beer tower!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty frickin awesome...  a huuuuuge sports bar / restaurant in the suburbs of Canada.  Clean, sporty decor, decent service, can hold a serious crowd!!!"}
{"text":"Although I live so close to Wegz, this was my first visit since living in the area for over a year. Talk about a sports bar, no, a stadium bar! This place is huge. I have never seen a larger sports bar. Given that it was a Tuesday night and there's a hockey lockout, there weren't many patrons so the ambiance was a little underwhelming. But it was definitely a great place to watch the US Presidential elections or the Raptors getting trounced.

We started with a brewtender and ended with a second brewtender. If you have never seen one before (I hadn't until then), imagine a coffee dispenser at a convention or wedding. Now imagine a clear version of that coffee dispenser with a center chamber filled with ice. That's genius right there. It prevents the ice from watering down your 80 oz of beer. Best invention ever.

Our waitress was very friendly and offered her suggestions on her favorite food items. We started with stadium size poboy nachos. Delicious. Lots of cheese, sour cream, and tomatoes. For a main, I had the chili poutine. Best poutine I've had in Canada so far (I'm comparing to NY Fries). The chili was delicious, and has quite a bit of spice. The poutine looks deceptively small since it comes in a small, square bowl. But I was quite defeated and could not finish eating because I was too stuffed."}
{"text":"Inedible, overpriced 'food' lead me to believe that this is one of the worst places to spend money while watching sports. 

The TVs are good, I'll agree. There's always something to watch, but the food and attitude of the waitstaff bring this place down to a 1*

Also, the beer selection is absolutely horrendous. Why can't I order a Canadian? What kind of bar in Canada does not have Canadian? Or coors? Or any local-Toronto based beers? 

If you're a fan of tasteless, overpriced food and budweiser beer, this is the place for you. Everyone else, stay away."}
