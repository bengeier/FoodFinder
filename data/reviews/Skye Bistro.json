{"text":"My wife and I had an early dinner here on a Monday. The staff was friendly and helpful, but it was obvious that the other waiter was much more interested in customer service than our waitress. Our waitress read off some specials, but we overheard the other waiter reading off a much more extensive list and go out of his way to make his diners much more comfortable.  The food was OK, but overpriced for what we received. I would not recommend getting anything with snap peas as the chef does not know to trim the stem ends off of the peas. The risotto also seems to be a favorite as it is a side with many entrees; however, it is a bit dense (Gordon Ramsey would not approve). It is very obvious that they are doing their best to make this establishment work, but I think they still need to update themselves a bit in order to draw a younger crowd. At present, it is a \"blue hair\" establishment. This may be the image they are looking to portray and clientele they are looking to attract, but the image discourages those under 40 from dining here.  I would also look to update the wine list. At present they have a wide range, but these are the very traditional and well-known mega-winery names. I would like to see some more unique items on the list."}
{"text":"I scoped out this restaurant's menu and hours online.  For my husband's birthday I made a Saturday night dinner reservation.  The restaurant confirmed my reservation via email and suggested a cake-- which I ordered for an agreed upon fee.  We arrived right on time, however the hostess informed us that there was no record of our reservation.  The dining area is very small and it was clear there was no way to squeeze us in.  I purposefully made a reservation for the dining room to avoid being seated at the pub or patio.  Since two six-person tables had been seated, waiting was not an option.  Hopefully this is not a common occurrence.  But, for us it ruined what was supposed to be a joyful birthday celebration.  Bottom line:  Make reservations, call to verify, note the manager's name, and only go if you're not in a hurry, and/or if you're wiling to eat outside or at the bar in the pub."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, friendly staff.   Good bartender.  Order an old fashion or a martini.  The menu is limited but tasty.  We enjoy it once a month or so.  The lobster mac and cheese is always a hit."}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner outside on the patio.  On a Saturday night, there was a solo guitarist to provide some atmosphere.  Orders included the half-chicken, rib-eye steak and shepherd's pie.  All meals were well prepared and tasty.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I have eaten lunch here a couple of times, but never got o try dinner until tonight (Friday, May 5, 2017).  I arrived at 5:30 p.m. and there were many tables available. I called ahead to make a reservation in case they were busy.  The service was very good and the waitress was attentive throughout the meal.  I had the shrimp cocktail (delicious, fresh, and with a great cocktail sauce), iced tea, and the New York Strip Steak which came with mashed potatoes and a vegetable medley (zucchini, squash and green beans).  The only down side were the vegetables.  The rest of the meal was perfect, but the medley was overcooked and bland.  With the high quality of food that I always receive here, it was not a major issue, but one that should be noted.  Since it was Friday night, they also had a musician playing guitar and singing. It was very pleasant and he is immensely talented.  When my wife returns from a work trip, I intend to take her here for anice date night away from the kids."}
{"text":"Just had mother's dinner here and everything was perfect - the waitress could be a little bit more friendly but then again she was working on Mother's Day.  The Prime Rib was to die for.  My sister from Texas as their scallops w/mushroom risortto and she loved it.  They were very accomendating since we had a party of 8 and two small children.  Have been there during the week and the only suggestion is their live entertaining made everyone else have to talk loud which then made the it a loud place to eat."}
{"text":"We dined here back in the summer on the patio by the \"pool\" in back. The setup was nice although a bit strange. If anyone had actually been in the pool they could have soaked us but I digress. To start I asked the waitress about some of the various bottles of wine they had. She had no idea how to answer my simple questions and seemed to have no way to find out. So I chose one I was unfamiliar with. It was a Red Zin and it was barely ok. I don't blame her for that though. Moving on.  We started with the Baked Brie app. It was simple. Nothing wrong with it just exactly what you expect. For dinner I had the Short Ribs ($23) and my fiancé had the Pork Tenderloin ($22). Immediately I knew why I found a Groupon for this place. The food was edible but at least, warm. It transported me to my worst nightmare, a retirement home. If bland, fatty, ill prepared food is what you're after, THEY'VE GOT IT!!!  The waitress had told us earlier that the death by chocolate dessert was out of this world and in my foolish mind I just kept thinking, it can't be as bad as this food. So we ordered it to go. Not worth the calories. We threw half of it out.  The front of house staff was very kind and accommodating which is why I've waited so long to write this review. If you like good food that has qualities like flavor and texture, do yourself a favor and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Nice Find In A Hotel  We were guests of the attached hotel (which also provided us a 10% discount, sweet!). The restaurant was not large however they creatively made seating in other areas such as outside on the patio. I could easily see that there were locals also (such as a young couple on a date). The waitress was very friendly and helped us make our choices. We there on a Wednesday evening and there was even a live piano player which added a nice little touch. The restaurant looked clean and fresh with a nice contemporary decor (making it very nice for date night).  Not too fancy.  I am a little confused by the name Yelp has as I believe it is just \"Skye\" with no Bistro."}
{"text":"Went to Skye with friends last nite, was disappointed, ordered Maine Lobster with wild rice, came as a bowl of rice and mushrooms, questioned waitress if Maine Lobster? she said yes some pieces of lobster claw in there, there was some and overcooked and chewy, not what I expected for Maine Lobster. Appetizers  were good,  Chocolate to die for desert was excellent."}
{"text":"I just had an amazing dinner at Skye!  I'm from San Diego, so didn't expect much from a place in a Best Western in suburban Cleveland- BUT I WAS WRONG!  Outstanding mussels with chorizo and sun dried tomatoes!  Crab cakes were as good as you can find anywhere.  Great service too!  Try Skye - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with coworkers for a girl' s night out.  Not enough space for everything they have going on.  I don't want to be on top of the table next to me.  Plus, we could hear the woman in charge talking about the guests.  She so needs a copy of Customer Service for Dummies!!  Reminded us of the Asian nail place Seinfeld episode.  Did not make a good impression on us."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a wonderful surprise to find in a Best Wester motel.   The food is very good and they have a number of GLUTEN FREE, or items that can be made gluten free, on the menu.  Their frier is dedicated so those of us who can't eat gluten, can have french fires and their homemade corn chips. Tonight we had baked brie for an appetizer, then we shared sweet potato fries. For my main course I had a wonderful large salad.    When it came time for desert, you can't beat their gluten free Death By Chocolate.  They have bar seating that is separate from the dining room.  It is a full bar with a TV.  I've eaten in the dinging room five or six times and never had the bar noise overflow into the dining area.  On Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings they have a piano player in the dining area.  It adds an intimate romantic atmosphere, that is missing during lunch."}
{"text":"Skye is truly a hidden treasure! We have been there twice in the last week and have had amazing meals each time. I enjoy good fish, but it can be difficult to prepare. Both meals, however, were perfectly done. Last week, it was barramundi; this week swordfish. Perfect! Tonight my husband had pork tenderloin, which was also wonderful. Skye is becoming the best restaurant in the area! Kudos to the new Chef, Joe, who is both artistic and able to handle the demands of a busy restaurant! Our server, Armando, is also a long-time pro and makes the experience memorable. Michael is the GM and deserves kudos for putting this great team together! You must try Skye soon!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Skye Bistro for an early dinner. My wife ordered the pasta special which was cheese raviolis with a lobster cream sauce which came with a side salad. Her dinner was fabulous and very decadent.  The cheese raviolis were creamy, and there was a good amount of fresh lobster with the the sauce. I had the fish and chips special.  The dinner came with hand cut fresh potato chips and absolutely the best fried fish I ever had.  The fish consisted of three large filets of perch.  I would order this again in a heartbeat.  The accompaniments were a fabulous tartar sauce, that was right on point and complimented the perch wonderfully, and an extremely tasty cole slaw.  This tasted like it was made fresh for me, not like most of the slaw you get with a fish and chips order at other restaurants.  I have had fish and chips in London, and this dish beats them hands down. Our waiter, Steve, was very cordial and made our dining experience special as he was very attentive to our needs. He is a great asset to the restaurant.  We have been to Skye numerous times and have never been disappointed.  Their food and service have always been top notch."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for dinner with a group of six.  We made a reservation which turned out to be wise as it was a busy Friday evening.  Several ordered the lobster Mac and cheese, one ordered the chicken Marsala, my wife had pulled pork and I ordered one of the specials that consisted of shrimp, scallops, mussels and Snapper on a bed of rice with asparagus.  We all thoroughly enjoyed our meals (the special was outstanding), the atmosphere was pleasant and the service was excellent.  This was my first visit here and I definitely plan to return."}
{"text":"Went here last night - Thursday Sep 28 at 730pm.  Just a few tables in the restaurant.  The food we had was awesome.  I had the scallops, the roasted beet salad, my husband had the stuffed mushrooms and a burger.  Now to the bad part - our server Kristy was just not very good.  She was friendly but that's about all the positive I can say.  Had to signal for Kristy to come over so my husband could have ketchup.  I had to ask her what the specials were.  She didn't volunteer until I asked.  After meal, no mention of desserts, no coffee, after dinner drinks.  She just brought out the check.  I was very disappointed in the service.  I have had great service with the other server Steve.  Make sure if you go ask for him to take care of you.  From now on that's what I will do."}
{"text":"To me our experience at Skye Bistro was as good as it gets.  The ambiance is thoughtful, aesthetically pleasing and relaxing.  The staff was proficient, attentive and professional.  My husband and I both found the food OUTSTANDING.  I had the pork chop and thought it was truly superb. My husband's berry dessert was truly outstanding.  To us the meal and the ambiance were just uncommonly good."}
{"text":"my wife reserved a special party room for my 60th birthday.  this is the best kept secret regarding gourmet/cozy dining in mentor.  the staff - very warm and friendly, facility- unique and charming, food - to die for great.  highly recommend.  thanks"}
{"text":"Went to Skye -- bar for some post dinner drinks.  It had two (fake) but realistic fireplaces.    Drinks were made to order; glasses were clean.  Bartender needs to spread attention to more patrons.  Friend ordered takeout and it seemed to come out pretty fast.  Restaurant and bar were pretty busy for that late in the evening...however parking sucks."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my boyfriend and another couple on a Wednesday night.   Sat outside and Armando was our server   We had fish tacos , shrimp cocktail, swordfish, scallops , and a New York strip !   All was very satisfying along with great atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"This is our solid go-to restaurant when looking for a good meal nearby. This particular Thursday evening we took my mother-in-law to celebrate her birthday. Our waiter, as usual, was outstanding in both personality and service. We all, surprisingly, decided on sandwiches. My mother-in-law's open face steak sandwich was perfect . She doesn't typically eat an entire meal... ever, but managed to finish almost all of it, with my husband enjoying her last few bites. My husband had the pesto chicken club and I had the chargrilled chicken sandwich and we both agreed that the sandwiches were outstanding, moist, flavorful and were just the right size. We mentioned the birthday and our waiter was kind and thoughtful enough to ask my mother-in-law her dessert preference and brought her a generous slice of carrot cake, most of which went home and provided two more treats for her! We have also enjoyed Skye on many other occasions, with the Dublin lawyer being one of my favorites but their nightly specials usually make it a hard decision. The only disappointment was the lack of entertainment - they have previously had a wonderful piano player, or occasionally guitarist. That really provides wonderful ambiance, but apparently have gone by the wayside. Hopefully it's just a temporary decision."}
{"text":"Always have a great experience here. Food is always good- last night I had the seared tuna on the specials menu which was great! Service is always above par and the food is always excellent.  Great atmosphere and last night there was live music but not obnoxious just a great musician with a great voice which added to the ambiance."}
{"text":"It is a nice atmosphere and the food is good! Our server Paul was probably the best server we have had serving us ever!"}
{"text":"Best Chicken Marsala I've ever had. Also, save room for the delicious gluten free chocolate mousse."}
{"text":"Anniversary dinner.  I had the homemade pasta with  shrimp, roasted red pepper & garlic.  It was good but could have had a bit more garlic flavor and I did ask for extra garlic.  My husband had the short ribs, garlic rosemary mashed & veggies and he loved it.  Our server Lisa was great.  Friendly with a warm welcoming smile.  We will for sure come back."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the food, wonderful menu with a great selection but I will not being returning. These people could learn a little about customer service. My server was totally inattentive and when I asked to speak to a manager I could see where she learned it from. This lady was so rude. To bad I would have came back hoping to host an event if it wasn't for her. It's such a shame because this restaurant has so much potential but until theres some staff changes future customers be warned. I hope Sam/Pam whatever her name was gets a few books on customer service for dummys."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and the ambiance is great. There are a few different rooms to sit. The main dining room offers casual elegance with live dinner entertainment on many nights. The bar is cozy and trendy. In the summer there is a comfortable patio seating.   The service over the years has never been horrible, but never special either. The problem is is that it doesn't live up to their price point. This is an area they can improve. Today's service was good, just nothing above and beyond. The cocktails have typically been good.  I like the variety in their menu and many of the things I've had have been good. There's just a lot of cliche flavors and many times over cooked vegetables. The offerings tend to be on the healthier side and I appreciate that. Today my daughter and I had the fish tacos. The fish wasn't fried, but instead had perfect blackened seasoning. It was flakey and perfectly cooked. The aioli was good, and after asking for lime wedges, I loved them. They are typically paired with chips which we upgraded to sweet potato fries. Those were cooked nicely with a little crunch but where you could still taste the potato. My martini was delicious, but pricey as was my daughter's skyy mule. Our bill was $43 before tip. Lunch was kind of slow there, but I think they'd do better offering some specials at that time of the day.   Overall, this is a great spot to hit up, I'd just highly recommend looking for a Groupon to bring the overall cost more in line with the experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Skye numerous times (10-12). The food is excellent, and the wine has always been reasonably priced. We always enjoy the musical accompaniment that Dan provides. It truly adds to the experience. This gem is a solid 4-5 stars. The reviews that drag it down are from sometime ago - before we began frequenting the restaurant. Lastly, we have taken our teenage children to Skye, because we wanted them to experience the food/live music combo, and they really enjoyed themselves. It's our favourite Mentor restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been taking my mom here for brunch on or near Mother's Day for the past four years, and each year the food has gotten markedly worse even though the service . This year was probably the last time we'll go. The brie appetizer, which used to be a lovely plate with brie baked with almonds and honey and a variety of breads and fruits, this year was a ciabatta sandwich bun (literally) quartered and toasted with a wheel of brie that had been microwaved with some raw almonds thrown on top, a sliced up mealy apple, and about 10 grapes. It's just disappointing that what was once a lovely appetizer is now basically terrible. The meals that we got weren't great either. I had a pasta primavera with uninspired grilled chicken with no flavor and a smattering of overcooked vegetables covered in a sauce that had so much butter and oil in it that it left grease on my chin. My mother had lobster macaroni and cheese which was heavy with that same greasy cream sauce and had what she described as \"canned lobster flavored meat\" in it.   I remember the past meals that I've had here, including an incredible salad and some very interesting tacos, and the fantastic servers and folks who work there, and I'm just sad for the decline in this place. It's too expensive and the food is too bad."}
{"text":"We went to Skye Bistro for my brother's 50th birthday.  The restaurant is located in the Best Western hotel which ave me some trepidation on the type of restaurant we were going to.  I had heard good things and hoped it lived up to the reviews.  The first indication that it was not going to live up to expectations was that our table of ten was seated next to the singer/guitarist/piano player.  The music made it very difficult to talk to those at the table.  The musician was very good but having him sitting at next to our table was troubling.  My parents felt left out of the conversation as they had to talk very loud to be heard and just decided to be quiet instead.  The waitress was doing her best to serve the group, but she also had other tables to serve which made the service slow. The waitress also did not have any assistance with clearing the tables, she was waitress and busser for all her tables.  We ordered our drinks and appetizers, potatoe chips with blue cheese and brie.  The chips were very good and the brie came with bread, some grapes and slices of apple.  The portions were enough to share.  Next came the dinner.  They offered specials, prime rib, trout and a few other items, along with their regular menu and pub fare.  The pub fare is the typical: sliders, salads, burger and fried sides such as calamari and french fries.  The portions of the specials were large and so much they could not be finished while the pub fare portions were to small leaving the diners wanting more.  Some of the items seemed to be missed or matched or described.  My wedge salad was chopped romaine though when it was placed on the table the waitress was sure to tell me it was a wedge.  I would have preferred her to just admit they ran out of iceberg and substituted romaine.  My husband's fish tacos came with french fries and no salsa or taco sauces.  Others had the meatloaf and ravioli entrees.  Again, it was good but nothing special.  Due to the server being stretched over to many tables she wasn't able to check on us and many of us were not asked if we wanted another beverage until the dinner was over.    The final issue I had with the meal was that as we were enjoying our dessert and coffee the waitress started to clean up the tables over our plates.  Some of us were still eating and it felt like they were trying to rush us out of the room.  For what we paid, I would have thought the service would have been better and the food a bit more special.    I am glad I tried the place out but do not think I would be going back.  There are many other places in Mentor that have similar food and better services."}
{"text":"Recently at Skye for a friends rehearsal dinner - the party began on the patio and dinner was served in a back room. The wine and appetizers were great and it was a pre-determined menu for our party. I ordered the steak, but it was very fatty :(   Although I came from out of town for the occasion, I would definitely come again if I lived closer!"}
{"text":"Skye is a very interesting restaurant that is very easy to pass up if you don't know what you are looking for. I have been multiple times, mostly for lunch, and it has never disappointed. The restaurant itself is very clean and the staff is always very attentive to whatever you need. The bar area is very relaxed with a good selection of drinks and a nice decor. I have tried multiple things on the menu, including many soups, and I have not had anything that I wouldn't eat again. I highly recommend Skye."}
{"text":"Excellent! Had a NY Strip with garlic mashed potatoes with the vegetable do hour (summer and zucchini with roasted red peppers). Also had the Blue Skye Chips for a shared appetizer. Drank a couple Great Lakes Brewing Co. Rye of the Tiger IPAs. Served some warm bread with the meal. A couple in our group shared their desserts (I had a Bailey's). Sampled Death by Chocolate and the NY Cheesecake. Both were excellent.   Our waiter was Steve. He did an excellent job and really rolled with our crazy group! Even snapped a couple iPhone photos for us, mid-meal.  Sat outside on and area Steve told us would be covered by next summer. It's next to the pool (the restaurant is part of the Best Western hotel). Cool night ... and it was neat to see they keep some blankets out there for anyone who might need to wrap themselves to ward off the chill.  Meals are a bit pricey - most entrees over $20 - but you get what you pay for, folks. It's darn good food and darn good service, so it's well worth the visit now and again!"}
{"text":"Skye is about 10 minutes from my office & home - it's always a \"go to\" if we can't decide where else to go. The food is typically fantastic although the service can be slow. Great standard menu with lots of specials. Also, they typically have a Groupon special... check it out! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Have dined at Skye Bistro several times with several different guests & everyone always enjoys the meal & comments on what a pleasant surprise Skye Bistro is & that they will be back. This time the guys enjoyed the prime rib special noting great flavor, doneness & the right amount of fat. Loved the \"Potato Du jour\" Rosemary mashed. Lawnfield salad just the right mix of tasty ingredients & dress perfectly - lightly & not drowned. My first disappointment EVER was the Lobster Mac & Cheese. Description sounded great but I found the cheese sauce mundane & the mac was absolutely drowned in cheese sauce reminiscent of Velveta. Don't mean to knock Velveta but I expect something a bit more sophisticated for an entrée at Skye. High marks for calamari which was tender & delicately breaded. Good selection of beers and Pom martini perfectly mixed. Even if you don't have room for desert get one and share - I recommend the chocolate cake. If you don't go for dinner it's a great place to stop for dessert & coffee or nightcap after a show. We've done this several times but we each get a desert and multiple forks for tasting each others.   The place is super clean from the bathrooms, sparkling glassware & table settings, bright white napkins to employees attire. Piano player plays soft dinner music in the restaurant and the Pub is quaint, energetic and friendly. There's even dining on the front porch or around the pool.  Skye Bistro is in the Best Western Lawnfield Inn & Suites. If eating \"hotel restaurant\" food would normally turn you off, as it typically does me, don't let it this time. You won't be disappointed. Though we've never been a guest at the hotel it looks like it would be a pleasant experience. Has a real upscale B&B feel."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and always great food and great cocktails. Recommended for a really nice dinner."}
{"text":"Stayed at the inn for several months and often ate at the bar. The food was always great and the wait staff were very friendly & knowledgeable.  I would make a special trip just to eat there. Excellent"}
{"text":"Outstanding burger.  Steve was a very fun and engaging server.  I would definitely eat here again when I come back to the area."}
{"text":"The Dublin Lawyer and Ribeye steak were phenomenal. The atmosphere is classy and tasteful."}
{"text":"Skye was a very unpleasant surprise. So loud you couldn't hear your dining companion across the table, in a crowded dining room. No specials, on a Saturday night.   My companion ordered a burger from the pub side of the menu (which also includes fish tacos, banh mi, etc.). Specified medium rare. I ordered the Caesar salad and butternut squash ravioli.  Some minutes later, our meals arrived -- oops, no, a shrimp risotto and short ribs arrived, only to disappear back into the kitchen and then float out to the bar dining area.  Much, much later, the burger and ravioli arrived. The Caesar? No explanation for why it never made the scene; perhaps it was misdelivered as well and that table was so famished that they pretended it was theirs.  The ravioli were OK; the burger was overcooked and uninspired. And did I mention it was noisy? Didn't help that despite our request with our reservation for a quiet table, we were plunked down next to the piano.  Our waiter, while pleasant at the start, pulled a disappearing act. My companion would've wanted a second glass of wine, but never got the chance to ask. And perhaps if he'd glanced our way once or twice, he might've noticed that the salad hadn't arrived.  The only nice part of the experience was walking down the hall to the parking lot and experiencing blessed quiet.  For anyone still interested after this: Wines by the glass were reasonably priced. The clientele skews very old -- at least 75% of the 40 or so people in the dining room with us were clearly over 60. The menu selection is relatively limited and doesn't have much in the way of creativity.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Always a favorite of ours. Service was great. Food fantastic. But disappointed that there is no longer music. We had enjoyed the pianist and guitar player. So relaxing and different from other venues. Made Skye a notch above the others.  Tho we will return, hopefully management will reconsider the music."}
{"text":"Wow!  That's how I have to start it off!  Best Western Lawnfield Hotel hit a home run when they decided to to listen to patrons and open a fine dining restaurant and bar.  I finally had a chance to check it out.  We first walked into the bar area, it is is very trendy and sleek, and the bar is opaque with cool blue light shining through it!  Very cool!  Although our reservations were in the dining room, I was very impressed by the bar area, I will have to check that out at another time!  We were promptly and politely greeted and shown to our table.  The atmosphere in the dining room is very elegant with a hint of nostalgia floating in the air.  Our waiter was more than polite, and he greeted us within a timely fashion and took our drink orders.  The menu has a dining room selection, along with \"Pub Fare\", which you can order off of also even in the dining room.  I started off with the crab cakes appetizer which was great!!  My dinner was the Salmon dish, and I have to say, the Salmon was FRESH!!!  Cooked perfectly, with no heavy Salmon smell I have had in the past.  It was nestled in a best of perfectly cooked wild rice and spinach.  It was great!  My fiance had a bone in chicken of some sort, which I tried, and it was cooked perfectly as well, but still had an unbelievable moistness.  We both had dessert, I had the cheesecake, and she had the bread pudding.  Both of us were thoroughly impressed with everything and we definitely have found a new regular place for us in Mentor.  Skye has definitely got it going on!  It is of the ranks of Molinari's and I glad that another fine dining establishment has decided to grow roots in Mentor!!"}
