{"text":"It was okay... , meat pie was okay with burnt fries. The service was good. It also would have been nice to have a drink menu."}
{"text":"By no means a regular here but have tried their lunch fare in many occasions. Always found it very good. First time for dinner last week and was definitely a mixed bag.   Service while pleasant was very slow and our server seemed to get lost on a number of occasions and have difficulty understanding pretty simple requests. Simple stuff, drinks sat on the bar for almost 20 mins, brought water for one, even when asked couldn't comprehend we wanted apps and entrees. Became comical after awhile.   Four entrees, two very good and two disappointing. Ribs and stir fry are good bets, pass on what they offer as a steak.   Prices reasonable and due to past history will return, just not when I'm craving a steak."}
{"text":"Amazing food, huge portions, reasonable prices, good service. Wow, I'm a fan. The Shepherd's pie was full of meat, veggies and flavorful gravy and came with a green salad. My date had the chicken pot pie. I was pleased to see they used the white meat of the chicken. It was topped with puff pastry that was cooked to just the right shade of brown. The pot pie came with french fries which I thought was an odd combination but it made me happy because they had tasted fresh and homemade. I'm sad we're just visiting because the Belfast Lounge could easily become a favorite but I'm happy we don't live here since I'd be big as a house if the Belfast Lounge became a favorite."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great once you get in the door, but dodgy until that point. Ordered the fish & chips - 3 pcs battered fish w. Generous fries and scoop of peas. Fish was unevenly battered with some edges completely bare and thus overcooked and chewy. The remainder of the fish was overall overcooked and lacked the soft, buttery texture expected with proper beer battered fried fish. The tartar that accompanied was mayo heavy and not appreciated. The  fries were disappointing - limp and over salted. This dish needs lots of work. Two stars reflect atmosphere and pleasant waitstaff. Definitely overpriced for poor quality of meal."}
{"text":"Really quiet place on Thursday evening. Was expecting Irish pub ambiance. A bit disappointed but Guinness is good at least."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong here. Good homemade comfort food, Huge portions and a fine selection of import pints. Beautiful bar."}
{"text":"I have been living in the area for almost two months. I travel a lot. I decided to try this place out. I have made it my local. Service is awesome, the people are courteous, professional and focused on the customer.  Now to the food : the Steak Pie is number one on my list, followed closely by the Shepherds Pie. Portion sizes are huge- come here hungry. Food is hot, tasty, delivered promptly and reasonably priced. This is not a stuffy , suit and tie place. Friendly people,  great food , great people and a welcoming atmosphere. What more could you ask for? I have no problem recommending this establishment."}
{"text":"Whoa I was mislead by the four star rating.  The beer lines in the place need a thorough cleaning, as mold was very noticeable in my pints.  My Thai pizza (a digiorno frozen pizza) was very bad.  My wife's soggy fries and frozen breaded chicken breast was equally as bad.  Nachos, to say the least, were nuked in the microwave.  Don't make the same mistake we did."}
{"text":"Great pub and resto. Had the chicken pot pie and it was Delish. Great service with a friendly vibe. Servings are huge. I wouldn't of known this place if it wasn't recommended to me. Glad I came. Iii definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Excellent service in a good pub atmosphere. The chicken pot pie was incredible. Beer selection was solid and the appetizer choices were exactly what I was hoping for. Whisky selections were good, with a decent choice of some excellent American and Scotch whisky. I would like to see more Irish whisky options. The bar is a bit tall for eating, but great for drinking and leaning. A cozy lounge area in the back is nice for a more casual night out with friends."}
{"text":"A co-worker and I enjoyed a Thursday lunch at Belfast Lounge.  I had a Guinness and the fish and chips, which was delicious and a good portion size. My co-worker enjoyed a chicken wrap."}
{"text":"We visited The Belfast Lounge twice during a long weekend in the Greater Toronto Area. In our opinion, it was a study of contrasts.  On one hand, the location was perfect, within walking distance of our hotel. On the other, the location was awkward, situated behind a gas station, in the middle of a strip mall, next door to a sketchy-looking nightclub (which we later found out is run by the brother of the pub's owner...hmmmmmmmm).   The inside is spacious and has a classic pub feel. However, on a Saturday night we could count the number of patrons on two hands. (Full disclosure:  during our first visit on Wednesday night, there were many more people.)  Their website advertises that they are open until 1:00 a.m. Monday through Thursday. However, we found the pub closed at 11:00 p.m. on a Thursday night.   We generally judge an Irish pub on two things:  1) the quality of their Guinness pour and 2) the quality of their fish & chips. Unfortunately, we were disappointed with both. The Guinness was too thin, fish too bready, and chips obviously reheated. But everything else we drank was excellent. My husband has become a fan of Kilkenny and they made me a pretty decent cosmo.  And that brings us to our bartender. She was a trip and a half. We hit it off with her immediately and after two nights felt like we had known her for years. It's not often that a bartender tells you her life story-I always thought it was supposed to be the other way around. You know you've made a connection when you find yourself sharing cheesecake recipes. Personality aside, she was always on the spot with drink refills and gave good recommendations when asked. She was clearly in command of the bar.  We give The Belfast Lounge 5 stars for the service, 2 stars for everything else."}
{"text":"A pleasant atmosphere and large food portions, but I can't help but wonder if they've ever even been to Ireland. Their \"Kerryman's Shepherd's Pie\" is made with ground beef, not lamb which is a typical of Canadian pubs. The real crime is their \"Traditional Irish Stew\" is also made with beef; my Irish relatives would have a heart attack over that one!  If you're going to claim to be traditional, at least make an effort."}
{"text":"I had to meet a client here for lunch, and was pleasantly surprised.  Nice ambiance, comfortable seats, and we were greeted with a smile upon entry.  Some good stuff on draft if you are into the dark ale, but a standard lager like my associate, or just a nice frosty cold lager for me.  We stared off with a salad which was fresh and crisp.  Not exactly exotic but certainly delicious and tasty.  We had a few minutes to talk shop before the main course came, along with a fresh cocktails, and if you like pub food then you will love this place.  My associate had the steak sandwich and fries, and i had the stew. I was told the steak sandwich was spot on for taste, and thre presentation was nice, and as for the stew, hey just as good as i had hoped.  It was comfort food that tastes great and fills you up.  I know i will be returning to this place, its very casual, very friendly and if the rest of the menu is like this, i will be very happy to hang out here and chat with friends over a pint."}
{"text":"My family and I always go to the Belfast lounge for every celebration we have and we have never been disappointed, its a home away from home. They never make you feel like your being rushed to leave. It's a great atmosphere that'll make you want to come back."}
{"text":"The food and service is amazing!  I had the fish and chips!  Huge portions!! The Caesar is much better with the horse radish!  Great suggestion by our waitress!  We are now in a food coma!  The owner was so nice to us!  And the ladies did a great job with the happy birthday song!  We are happy we came here to celebrate a father son birthday!  We will definitely be coming back!   Plus it's perfectly located next to Yuk yuks!!"}
{"text":"Bartender was more interested in discussing her personal relationship problems with some old fart at the end of the bar than wait on her customers.  Twenty minutes, maybe more without even looking to see if someone may be thirsty.  Won't be back"}
{"text":"Great pub with good food and services. Pretty big portion too. Gotta try their Shepherd's pie and steak sandwich."}
{"text":"Came to this place based on Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. The food was very good as was the service. The chicken pot pie was recommended and was very good."}
{"text":"Despite the peeling dark green wallpaper on walls and Michael Bolton music (huh?), this place is actually cool!  Lot's of great booths, other comfortable seating throughout, spurts of occasional genuine Irish music (please play this more often!), fast courteous service, fresh pub fare, decent portions and the Barking Squirrel, which is my fav beer on tap, a must try for anyone! Lot's of parking in front!"}
{"text":"Horrible disgusting dump! Don't believe me? Walk in the front door and see for yourself. The bar is dirty, seats old, the edge of the bar is so huge and chairs LOW that you have to hunch way tf over to eat garbage food . .. yay!"}
{"text":"GREAT service we had just a wonderful young lady taking care of us. The food is very food and the price cannot be beat. I had the shepard pie but found out from my English friend it was actually Cottage Pie. Regardless great food great place and  looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Had a bite here (Sept 27/14), the Steak Pie was on special for $14.00. To say this pie was superb would be an understatement. This is clearly restaurant made & it shows the pride the chef has in the food. The quality & flavour of the pastry as well as the filling was out if this world. This is the best steak pie I've eaten. The fries are excellent & taste like fresh cut. If you're looking for authentic Irish Pub style food...this is a must try."}
{"text":"Tip:  If you're looking for peace 'n quiet, or here with your family, sit towards the back of the restaurant.  If you're seated near the front, expect it to be noisy 'cause it's near the bar.  5/5 - Staff 3.5/5 - Food  5/5 - Portions  Firstly, do not be intimidated to go here.  Yes, even if you're not a \"bar person\".  I'd say that this place is more of a family/neighbourhood joint that just happens to have a bar.    Secondly, my server was very friendly.  Girls are quite young, but they're nice and accommodating.  Portions, OMG HUGE.  I guess they reflect prices as they average $16-18/plate and there were specials posted at the door.  My only criticism is that the food could've used a tad more seasoning (salt).  This is great if you have high blood pressure, but on the bland side for me.  Fries were REALLY good, but just add your own salt.  Shepherd's pie, ok, again required a bit more salt for me, both meat & potato portions.  Very friendly atmosphere, so I wouldn't hesitate to go back!"}
{"text":"Good stuff!!  Portions are great and food is good. Fish and chips always hit the spot but don't miss out on the meat pie!  Staff is friendly and attentive and food comes out quickly. Great Irish pub ambiance and beers to match"}
{"text":"Dropped in while nearby on business - food was great, pints were fresh - a good mellow Irish pub - 2 thumbs up"}
{"text":"Second time I've been here and I'm the Duke! That's good for a star. The other two are for the cold beer which is very good and the quasi friendly service. Weird vibe. Seems the bartender doesn't really want to be here. She is not rude, but clearly isn't very friendly."}
{"text":"Don't be afraid of the exterior, previous comments are correct sketchy looking strip mall bizarre looking nightclub next-door, but work past that and go inside  Bar man &  waitstaff were fantastic, food.... great pub grub with a wonderful choice of beers on tap.    Do the steak pie, you won't regret it also McGargles IPA rocks!"}
