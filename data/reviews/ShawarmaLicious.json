{"text":"The is a very fancy nice restaurant for families and good size groups. I went there with family and it wasn't that busy so the service was decent. It would have been slow as there was only one person working and doing everything from cash register to making the food.

As for food we ordered the Chicken Shawarma Plate, Mixed Shawarma Plate, Chicken Shawarma wrap and couple of manakish (beef and cheese). Overall the serving size of the plates were decent, the Meat was quite good tender and cooked well; but where they lost points was it was too dry to eat. They didn't have sauces which go with it, Although we were give garlic and hummus sauce. The manakish on the other hand were quite good. 


Overall just another spot and nothing too fancy about it.

For my muslim folks - They serve Halal meat!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service so far...group of us went in to order food, it was empty when we went in...when we started giving the order he didn't even take our order properly..only one of us wanted the food in the takeout box...and he assumed that rest of the people wanted in take out box as well. We waited about 45 mins and there were people who came after us, got their food. Finally when we were paying, we told him that it took him long time and he said that he didn't think he took long...if 45 mins is not long...I don't know what is...then after he finished taking everyone's payment...he comes out of the counter and told one of us to go outside and fight if we want to. Let me be clear...we are all in our late 20s...we are not the crowed who would go and start picking up fights...but seemed like the guy didn't understand that this is not back home and if he hits someone he can go to jail... Instead of apologizing for late food...he said \"It's not that late...if you don't want...don't come back\"...if you do not want customers...why are you working in this food industry???"}
{"text":"This is the worst place to go. The owner, server everyone is just simply awful. Awful service and awful food. Especially the guy Mohammed over there he have the worst attitude for service industry.

First we waited 45 min for simple shawarma, 2nd when we tried to complain and he was rude and non apologetic, 3rd after accepting payment he started to intimidating us to LET'S TAKE IS OUTSIDE now we all know what does it mean.....!!!!. This is how a simple shawarma complain about bad customer service went all the way up to new level. With all the females and kid accompanying with us he wanted to fight for our genuine complain. BRAVO 

Beware guys....  There are many decent place to have Good food in GTA.  Just be careful if you guys are going there with family because you may get more ACTION then what you are looking for and they also own Shisha place ( SHISHA LICIOUS) next to it"}
{"text":"Went there in the afternoon when it was empty.  Very nice place inside but very dirty.  Chicken shawarma was good. Beef shawarma little dry. Not much flavour in both."}
{"text":"HALAL!

I tried this place on a whim and got a chicken shawarma sandwich to go. I was at the burger place next door but always wanted to try this place so I ended up taking a sandwich home with 2 cheese manakeesh.

To my surprise the food was amazing! The chicken was marinated and had its own flavor. The pita was filled with meat and toppings. Finally, a shawarma that tastes like it's supposed to. The cheese manakeesh was also tasty with the delicious akawi cheese. 

The owner has a shisha lounge right next door which I didn't get to try but will definitely in the near future. Definitely a must go place for food! Clean, nice set-up, and friendly staff that listen to you."}
