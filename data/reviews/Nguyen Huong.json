{"text":"Our family use to love buying dessert and Vietnamese sandwiches here. But this year finances was really bad and though just one wk before when I was shopping at another store and customer in front of me left his wallet behind with a lot of cash. The first thing I thought of is I must catch this man otherwise his children might not have a proper Christmas. However the same courtesy was not extend to my precious aunt who visit this store on Thursday Dec 19th 2013. No one was in line after her, just her wallet and $920 cash, a small portion this was meant to pass to me for her a replacement laptop the remainder for her son and to pay bills. She has been living on Cdn Pension for 7 yrs now. So loosing that sizeable amount is detrimental to her finances. We reported to police but they can only call us if her id are returned. Cash is considered gone. But for sure I will never go to this store if their staff are like that. The store staff said the security camera is not turn on. If broken or not turn on, they are inviting robbery and I am sorry to say but they deserve it if they treat their customers like this. Today I found out police did call and someone dropped off wallet without $920."}
{"text":"Pssst there's a Nguyen Huong inside the B&T Vietnamese grocery store.    Ok it's not a big secret, but it's not readily found either.  Nguyen Huong is famous for making Banh Mi,  Vietnamese sub sandwiches. They currently have 5 stores in the GTA and distribute their assorted subs to the various T&T groceries.   This location is a full fledged store offering the whole shebang from meals to go, snacks, desserts, deli, all packaged to take home.  Layout, it's small but has the essentials. A long order/pickup counter on right and a refrigerated area on the left.   There is no seating available so keep that mind. It's purely a takeout establishment.  I looked over the menu and went with the old reliable no.1 cold cut sandwich made spicy\" at a tune of $2!  Hello! that's pretty cheap.   I tell you nothing beats getting a Banh Mi fresh!  She asked me how many I wanted, I answered just one. Suppose at this price, you can buy a few for later?  Inside the sandwich you get:   Pickled cucumber Cilantro Carrots Assorted Cold cuts Jalapeno pepper ahh mouth is still on fire!! Hot Spread of liver pate  They have other sandwiches available like the lemon grass sausage, chicken, meatball, bbq pork/chicken. Nothing is priced more than $3  If you're in area and you want  to have a fresh Vietnamese sub for cheap check this place out."}
{"text":"At my friend's recommendation, we came to try the assorted cold cut banh mi. Previously before I only had premade packaged ones that were cold and hard. The ones here are freshly made and you can taste a huge difference from the cold cuts, carrots, and cilantro. For $3, it's a great deal for this sandwich. I would cone again to try the other options. Besides sandwiches, there are numerous side dishes for sale.  In addition to their deli area of premade Vietnamese dishes and sandwiches, there is a grocery area next to it making it very convenient to eat and shop."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with a $3 sandwich!  Always leaving satisfied after having a Banh Mi from Nguyen Huong.  I enjoy their original meat banh mi. Nothing fancy, I do avoid their fatty pork, not a huge fan.   Their pickled radish is always so juicy and packed of flavour. I crave for their pate.  Topped with fresh corridor!   Give it a try, you wont regret it!   Happy Belly :)"}
{"text":"The sandwich I had was definitely better than expected. I thought this was a place that served hot grilled meat sandwiches but actually it serves cold sandwiches. I had a cold pork sandwich. It was great and a quick and cheap lunch for $3.75."}
{"text":"The vaughan location conveniently located beside a grocery store saves you a trip from traveling to their main location in Chinatown. By far the best deal for a amazing sub/ sandwich with freshly baked bread. The spicy sub just had enough kick to bring the flavors out without touching your tongue. Be aware for long line ups and bring cash."}
{"text":"Omg why am I just discovering this chain now?!  Best Banh mi place ever. They have about 4 locations, this is one is in the plaza across from Vaughan Mills. It is located next to a Vietnamese Supermarket and the two connect with each other. We went in around 6 on a Saturday night and it was still pretty busy in there. We asked the lady working which sandwich she would recommend and she number 1 and 4 is the best, but they are sold out of number 4...So number 1 it is LOL?   She was premaking the numbers 1 so the sandwiches were instantly ready after that conversation. The sandwiches were still warm and smelled delicious. Both of them were $3 and they were massive. There was also a lot of filling in them. We got one spicy and the other without. I accident ate the spicy one and my mouth was burning. WOOO was it HOT.   The rest of the sandwich was really fresh, from the bun to the cold cuts. You definitely cannot go wrong with $3 and the value you get with it. The sandwich is also so filling.   I can't wait to go back and try other things they offer."}
{"text":"Simple place to get good viet food. The place is right next to a grocery store so it is quite small. Typical fast food place with viet buns and grab and go type of lunches/dinners.  Btw it is cash only. Other than the prices not being shown, this is a great easy place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Would the real Nguyen Huong please stand up? Please stand up?  Oh, there you are and you're in the same plaza as Mister Baguette.  I barely noticed you being beside the Southeast Asian Grocery Store.   2.5 *Star*  Okay, this looks more like the Nguyen Huong that I've visited in Scarborough and Downtown.  Fridges align with Deli Meats, Prepared Foods, Snacks and Desserts.  Vietnamese Sandwiches(Banh Mi)?    Of course! They make each one to order here without any pre-made ones.  Still the rockhard tasteless Baguettes of all Nguyen Huong branches but you can't ask for much when you're paying half the price of Subway Sandwiches.  It ranges from $1.75 to $2.50 or so depending on your choice.  3 Color Drink($2.50) - Don't get it.  Just don't get it here.  Half the cup is Ice Cubes and I had to remove them first since they were placed on top of all the Jelly and Beans.  #10 Lemongrass Sausage($2.25) - Lemongrass Sausages are pretty tasty and all the standard Banh Mi ingredients are given such as Pickled Veg, Cilantro, Mayo and Jalapeno.  I just don't like eating it with the Baguette.  Btw, I'm less of a Bread person so that you know."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for many years, every time I visit Vaughan Mills. I've always gotten the cold cut Banh Mi but today I tried the garlic sausage! I've never had Banh-Mi's at other locations so I can't compare the quality relative to other places. I always enjoy the sandwiches because I I love the crunch of the bread.   Personally I don't like too much of the spread they put since I don't like it too creamy but that's all! I recommend their spring rolls, they're perfectly crunchy and soft - each is $1.50. That's pretty good considering at most restaurants it's $5-6 for 2 rolls. The service is really quick you can come in & out in a few minutes. They also have large selection of desserts, appetizers and drinks to go along with the Banh Mi's.  Love this place !"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick bite or even breakfast, lunch and dinner for the next day, say no more! At prices that start from $3 to just about $4, you've got to be kidding me! In a very small shopfront that links directly to a Vietnamese grocery store, this place is certainly a hidden gem! The lemongrass chicken and super are my absolute favorites just because they are really easy to make and you can even spice them up or keep them mild!  You might also like the honey garlic banh mi which reigns supreme because when it comes to flavor, this place has absolutely nailed it. And the best part? They have the honey garlic sausages sold separately so you can buy just as many as you want and have a little snack on the side while you're at it!  Honestly, if you are in Vaughan and don't want to spend so much money, check out this place, but remember... Bring CASH! This place is a cash only take out, but for the price you may as well buy 4, 5 or even 6 banh mi's like I do!"}
{"text":"This place is really close to work and makes fab sandwiches.  The first few times i tried the shredded chicken.  They are really generous with the fillings.  I tried some vietnamese ham I think, which came with pate.  It was great.  And it's super cheap.  I think I paid $2.50 for the ham sandwich and $3.50 for the shredded chicken.  Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Best stop for bahn mi buns!! Only $3 for the assorted cold cuts and the rest are a max of $4.50.   The ladies there are so friendly and they will always ask if you want spicy or not spicy. You can choose not to go for the cilantro if you'd like as well.  Their desserts are also a delicious snack to have. Just enough but not too little! Definitely head there if you're craving a real Viet snack."}
{"text":"I go to Nguyen Huong all the time. It is right beside the Vietnamese grocery store. It is definately a great place to go if you wanna Banh Mi;) (Vietnamese sandwiches) and get great viet side dishes. I usually only get the sub. Its around 2-3 dollars for a sub.   In the sub there is options to include: Pickled Carrots, Pickled Turnips, Cucumber Cilantro, Pate, Mayonaise, Hot Peppers (SO GOOD) and your choice of Meat (Usually I get the Honey Garlic Pork or the Assorted) Those are the best ones in my opinion.  The bread is crispy on the outside and the bread in the inside is nice and soft. The combination of flavours just goes together so well. I usually eat 2 per sitting and I must have my hot peppers. I repeat MUST!! If you feel for a sub this is the place to hit the spot. Cheap as hell for delicious food, its also fast and convenient. Pick up a couple now, you wont be disappointed"}
{"text":"I have been eating their Banh Mi for years. Originally I would go to their location on Spadina when they were only $2. Now I checked our their Vaughan location and they are still as good as before and still cheap at $3, for the assorted cold cuts."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best banh mi places in the north GTA.   Word of advice, do not eat the banh mi in your car no matter how tempting, as their bread is incredibly crunchy, and flaky. I always seem to make a huge mess eating this, as there just does not seem to be any \"clean\" way of eating this.  As mentioned their breads are very crispy and flaky, part of the appeal of the sandwich. The portion ingredients are also very fair and lemon grass sausage is usually my go to here.  Their regular subs are tasty, and they have a very good variety of sandwiches.  Other places have done their own spin on banh mi (also named after the type of bread they use in the sandwich which is the French baguette), but this is the \"original\" style and still very tasty.  Price is incredibly hard to beat given their most expensive sandwich is objet about $3, really how can you go wrong?  Definitely worth a try, and I always make a pit stop when in the area."}
{"text":"We came here because a friend recommended on their Vietnamese Banh Mi sandwich.  We never thought it was located next to Vaughan Mills Mall.  When we first walked in we saw a lot of ingredients inside the open fridge.  Apparently, you can customize the sandwich to your liking.  While we are there we try to take some photos but the sales lady said no pics or video allow.  We end up ordered the assorted cold cut sandwich from their menu.  The price was very reasonable.  The sandwich and the meat inside is very fresh.  Definitely a great place to go to for afternoon snack."}
{"text":"We dropped by for a quick lunch before heading over to Vaughan Mills mall on a Saturday afternoon. The banh mi are good, inexpensive, and filling.   The banh mi we picked are reasonably priced and enough to keep your appetite full.  Picked the \"Super\" (#4 on the menu) with no butter, it had bacon, the basic meats, cilantro, pickled carrots and daikon.   Overall, it was a delicious sandwich.  Well worth the $3.50 price tag. All the meats and pate blended well together. The baguette itself was perfect for the sandwich.  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.   Also had a bite of the bbq chicken (#8 on the menu). Both sandwiches were good.  If you are in the mood for banh mi then check this place out!  Service is efficient, responsive and direct. The place is located in between a large supermarket and Dollarama. The place was bustling -- a lot of people coming to buy multiple sandwiches and other offered items.   There isn't any seating inside, so definitely a take-out if you want to give it a try. These banh mi are best eaten while they are fresh. Prices are just about right. Give them a try if you are passing through."}
{"text":"Great place to get cheap Vietnamese snacks, desserts and banh mis!  This Nguyen Huong location is connected to the B&T supermarket outside of Vaughan Mills. I stopped by to order a spicy banh mi and it was made to order (with pickled raddish, pate, cold cuts, cilantro, etc)..came out to only $3 for the super size one! They also have a bunch of other sandwiches (shredded chicken, pork, etc). The lady was very friendly!  There are also a bunch of Vietnamese desserts such as coconut milk puddings...drinks, sausages, other snacks... most things came out to a few dollars...very cheap and delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been to this branch of Nguyen Huong a few times and, like the rest of the world, am in awe of the cheap prices for banh mi (which is Vietnamese sandwiches). This location is attached to the funky smelling Vietnamese supermarket B&T (which sets them apart, I suppose, from T&T). The prices range from $2.50 to $3.75 and the options are cold cuts, super, chicken, vegetarian (which comes with delicious tofu), lemon grass sausage and more. As is typical of banh mi the sandwiches come with coriander, pickled carrots, their special mayonnaise and, should you consent, hot peppers. The problem with that is that they refuse to spread it evenly and one gets a blob of hot spice all in one shot, in one bite and in one spot. Ouch! On the plus side, all banh mi are made freshly in front of you.   As to why Vietnamese sandwiches are so cheap well leave that to the wonders of 'mystery meat' and ask no questions.  I prefer their original downtown location for the simple fact that getting into and out of Vaughan Mills is a drag and a chore. Greedy mall owners stuff their premises with so many buildings and businesses that there is always a long line of cars snaking in and snaking out. It is just not worth going to the malls, which have more traffic than the 401 and less parking space than a Wal-Mart with a new shipment of tacky ladies' animal print pants.  The buns on the banh mi are also fantastic. I understand they have their own bakery in North York. Take that crappy Subway!"}
{"text":"Remember the good ol days when you could get this for $1.75?  Well haha not anymore or never at this location anyways, they've kept prices same for years now from $3-5.   It's strictly a take out place, no seating in the area to be found here. The ladies here can be very friendly but are usually to the point of get your order and moving the line fast.   When ordering the veggie sandwiches(banh mi) they'll always ask if mayo is ok. For spice level, a little spice means 1-3 chilies which is hot and will still linger and heat your tongue. The right side of my tongue and lip is warm-swollen feel from munching a chili! So eat prepared and order a milky beverage to qualm the fire in your mouth!  The viet desserts are yummy, if you love coconut milk then you're a fan. Usually a bean with tapioca shaped jelly in a sweet coconut milk soup.   You can also buy the sandwich meat and other ingredients to make your own sandwiches at home which is handy.   The French banquettes are always so fresh here, a great place to grab a snack or lunch if in the area."}
{"text":"Disliked when they premade the banh mi... It didn't look fresh. I asked for extra chili, the lady took one of the premade banh mi from the back and added more chili. She broke the top part of the banh mi and didn't even bother fixing it... just kinda threw the broken part in. Was really upset seeing that scene.  However it's $5 for 2 so I guess I shouldn't complain.  Quality is not the best, it is decent banh mi. And since they premade it, it's sometimes a hit or miss. It's quite dry sometimes. Recommend when you need cheap lunch or something quick to go with."}
{"text":"Nguyen Huong's Banh Mi is my perfect in between meal snack!  I like how they made every single Banh Mi when their customer order them instead have them all pre made as at the Scarborough location. As I like to request my sandwich extra extra spicy!!  Line moves fast! Even before I can decide what I want! Grilled Pork? Lemongrass Sausage? Chicken? Cold Cut?  I can snack on one of those everyday!   FYI, Scarborough location does have a less doughy baguette for their more expensive banh mi."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with $3 lunch. Banh mi has gone up in price quite a bit over the years but still cheap for $3 (tax in) or $3.5 for the bigger size sub. The spicy is really spicy as they use fresh harbanero peppers. Picked carrot and fresh cilantro go nicely with cold cut subs.  We usually grab a few subs for lunch and some extra for later. I also like the desserts here: steamed banana cake with coconut, fried sesame balls, Banh bo (honeycomb cake) and the che. The Viet sausages are delicious as well.   Cash only!"}
{"text":"this franchise is popular for their banh mi's ,   pretty good and authentic as expected... i would come back and try other items such as desserts... its one of the only places i can find the fermented raw pork with peppercorn in banh mi...  raw pork.. good stuff.."}
{"text":"I love the subs from this place. I was once told that they supply T&T so they must be decent right? The subs are quite cheap ranging from about $2.50 to $3. I usually get assorted cold cut and nem nuong. You can ask for spicy or not spicy. I enjoy the spicy but it can vary from time to time from being enjoyable to oh my god my lips are on fire. The bread is always crispy and everything is very fresh. I sometimes like to save these for lunch by wrapping them in saran wrap and keeping them in the fridge. They don't usually last long in our house but are good for a solid two days. They offer a few other ready to eat options including fresh rolls. However these are so easy to make it home and when you go out theyre usually kind of stingy with the shrimp. The only other thing I order here is a pack of nem nuong to go. The girls working there aren't overly polite but they're definitely very efficient. Bring cash as i don't believe they accept card."}
