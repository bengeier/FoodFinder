{"text":"\"Souper\" great service at this restaurant. The soups are very tasty, plus they are guilt-free as they are super healthy with all kinds of nutritional herbs. The menu also has a great selection of stir fry dishes, good for those who are not in the mood for a super light meal. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Overall - 3.5/5.0  Small family owned restaurant that specializes in an array of healthy Chinese soups using a combination of meats (chicken, pork and lamb), fruits and natural herbal ingredients.   Each soup has its own set of health benefits and it is highly recommended that you review each one of them (or have them advise if you cannot read Chinese) so that you can get the most out of it. Apparently some soups are made specifically to support women's health and so forth.  Tried a couple different soups and both were great. You can really taste the true essence of each ingredient that they put in and can tell that a lot of time have been spent on making the soup. Each sip was very comforting to the soul.  They also have rice dishes as well as traditional desserts. I tried the spare rib rice dish and unfortunately it was not as well prepared as their soups which is a bummer. The spare ribs had more of a salty taste than the actual black bean taste. I would have liked to see a bit more black bean concentrated into a thicker sauce. The rice was too mushy and some parts were undercooked. I would have also liked the spare ribs to be steaming hot rather than lukewarm.  I would definitely come back for the soup but only if I'm actually in the area and have had a meal else where which makes this option a less convenient choice."}
{"text":"Not great. Good service, and that's it. The person in the front gave some suggestions and was really friendly. She spoke perfect English.   Food was blah. Didnt get a sense of Flavour. I got a chicken dish with vegetarian soup. The chicken dish was 10$, while the soup 7$. The portions were ridiculously small. The chicken dish came with bok choy which tasted as if it wasn't washed. The soup was ok, but still don't think I'll be visiting anytime soon.   I went on a Thurs night, it was dead empty."}
{"text":"Went to this place after seeing their grand opening. This restaurat is billed as home style soups and food. Focusing on healthy meals. The servers were nice and it was clearly a family restaurant. However the food was a bit sub par unfortunately. The soup was lacking a lot of flavours. It was mostly ginger flavour as opposed to  chicken which is what the soup was supposed to be. The steamed spare ribs were also cold when it first arrived. And overall was not much there. The owners were nice and offered free desert. Overall though i think its needs a lot of improvement still in price and portion and flavour. I think a lot of the problems stem from an inexperienced cook. And not enough focus on materials and balancing the flavours for a healthy but tasty meal"}
{"text":"This restaurant has many healthy food options such as the Chinese soups (there must've been over 10 different types) which uses herbal ingredients that serves a lot of health benefits. I really enjoyed the soup, it was rich tasting and surely packed with nutrients, which I can appreciate. Portions are good, no complaints. Overall, it's a restaurant that focuses manly on healthy eating. I will definitely come back to try the other Chinese soups that they have. Also, the legendary chicken was very yummy too."}
{"text":"This place is probably underrated by those who come in expecting it to be just another Chinese joint where one gorges on mounds of greasy foods. In reality, Souperfoods is trying to do the exact opposite - their goal appears to be to offer a healthy alternative to those aforementioned places...and they do a good job with that. This makes a lot of sense actually when you learn that one of the co-owners is actually a Naturopathic Doctor.  FOOD:  They offer several different stir fry options  including chicken, beef, lamb, or calamari with vegetables. They have some different boiled vegetable options as well. Although my favourite dish was definitely the pork ribs, which were literally fall-off-the-bone tender, this place's bread and butter is all about the healthy food options. As per its namesake, Souperfoods is all about the soups!! So of course they offer an assortment of clean and healthy soups and stews that you don't need to feel guilty about.  SERVICE:  This is a family owned business, and you can really tell that by the service. Everyone was quite friendly and helpful when ordering and bringing out the food, particularly the woman who is the main server. They seem to really believe in what they are offering.  ATMOSPHERE:  This is not a huge restaurant, but it's not really trying to be either. It is clean and quiet, which I think suits the image that they are going for. Apparently they actually offer a food preparation service that supplies students and others with meals throughout the week.   VERDICT:  I'll be back, especially when I start to feel guilty about having too much other greasy unhealthy food."}
{"text":"3.5 Star  Soup - 4 Star Rice Dish - 2.5 Star Service - 3 star  Back again tonight for dinner so to try out the Main Dish with their Grand Opening 30% off.  We ordered 2 dish and the Steamed Meat Patty was disappointing as it was not freshly made and dry. I recommend to stick with the made when order stir fried items instead. Differently pricey for $8.99 if regular price. I doubt I would order any rice dish again.  Soup on the other hand was still excellent, which I still enjoyed a lot.  If paying full price, a soup + rice dish with tax and tips would be $20! That is just a little too rich for me. Hopefully they will come out with a special pricing for combo."}
{"text":"for me, this place only gets a 3/5 because of couple of reasons.  1. service of the waitress was good.  The girl spoke perfect english and not the typical chinese style bad service i would normally expect. 2. the herbal coconut soup that was surprisingly sweet and delicious.  other than those two points.. the rest of my meal was very mediocre.   dont expect a fancy place.  It mainly focuses on herbal soups.  i came with my family and tried the food.  Portions are small, food was mediocre and presentation is almost non existing.    i hope they are able to find their niche customer... especially with winter around the corner."}
