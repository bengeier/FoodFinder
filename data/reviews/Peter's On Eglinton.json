{"text":"I'm with Ryan M.  What gives, Yelp?  If you're looking for a low-fat, tasteless meal, this is the wrong place for you. If you're looking for great food heaped so you can take some home, this is it!   Small Pork Souvlaki is my fav, one of the best in the city. Very flavourful, and the Tzaziki is fabulous with lots of garlic. Service is brisk, so it's great for lunch. 

I haven't had anything on the menu that wasn't good. I tend to stick to the above mentioned meal, or the fish &chips. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great place for having breakfast 
Staff (Christina) very helpful and caring 
Nice place to have relaxed brunch 
Price points are very  reasonable, 2 can have continental breakfast /coffee/sundae for around $35
Go and try , it's a hidden gem"}
{"text":"Had high expectations based on the reviews. I ordered the Alfredo with ham. It was quantity over quality unfortunately. The helping could have fed four people easily. The pasta noodles were in small pieces so either boiled to long or the were broken before boiling or the cook was pretty aggressive. It was too garlicky as well and lacked creaminess. 

On the other hand, the Mrs. ordered lasagna it was quite good. Enough for two. 

I prefer quality over quantity so I was not pleased with my selection. Looking around, quantity of food was the main driver for this establishment. Service was just ok. No refills offered when sitting with an empty glass and plates and food was almost tossed on the table like you would experience at a cafeteria. 

I would go back maybe to try a deli sandwich but not for a dinner plate."}
{"text":"Really tasty food. I had only gone the once and was pretty pleased. The prices were okay, the portions were massive and the service was quick. I think it was a little funny how the water was refilled quickly but almost like it was a test to see how many things she could splash while she was there. It was kind of ridiculous.

The food was really nicely done, and everything looked great. I didn't mind the decor at all."}
{"text":"For lunch today me and my husband decided to try this place (again) it cost $37.50 for two sandwiches :( so don't go there if on a budget. I ordered the Blt and he got a steak sandwich. The Blt very standard and came with fries,coleslaw and a pickle so not too bad,large portions. Except here is where it gets weird... My husbands \"steak sandwich\" $19.99 came on a hot dog bun with tomatoes, over cooked and not seasoned....:( both combos had no beverage and fries were soggy and not appetizing. We will not be back that's 100000%"}
{"text":"I called for take-out- I was told \"We're too busy for that right now, call back in half an hour\" - it must be amazing to be so successful you don't need customers."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about the good food and large portions at Peter's on Eglinton ... And so I had to try it for myself. The decor was outdated, but what I'd expect, for a restaurant located across from a senior's home. The owner seated the elderly closer to the window areas and seated families/ younger crowds at the booths. The wait staff were all elderly, but were quick and pleasant in my opinion. I wanted to try their famous deli sandwich and ordered the Montreal smoked meat small. It was a hefty size, full of meat, but a bit dry. it came with straight fries ( gravy was .75 extra) and average tasting coleslaw. No room for dessert. we did get a mix of white and multigrain buns with butter when we arrived. The food was typical, average, diner food in big portions. Nice to try, but nothing amazing."}
{"text":"Visited the restaurant on the holiday Monday (August 4, 2014) after seeing a movie at the Queensway. I'd never been before, while my dining companion (who'd suggested the place) was hailed by several people during our time there.

Even though I already knew beforehand that there would be A. Lot. Of Food, I ate a pumpernickel roll from the bread basket, then not only ordered the large smoked meat on rye (with coleslaw, fries, pickle), but was yearning for onion rings, something I haven't had for years. I demolished a \"significant\" quantity (very crispy and not greasy) before turning my attention to the sandwich. Not that I'd even consider trying to eat it like a sandwich. So I dug my fork into the meat in the middle, knowing I'd be taking most of it home. Loved the taste.

I am normally not a fan of coleslaw. It's usually just a pile of thick raw cabbage drenched in vinegar. However, I thought Peter's coleslaw was divine. The dressing was light and full of flavour. I asked our server how it was made. She didn't tell me exactly, but did say it contained milk and mayonnaise. I devoured it all!

The fries were the only detraction from my full enjoyment of the meal. Considering how precisely the onion rings had been cooked, I wished the fries had been crispier - because the insides were too soft and starchy. And I'm not a fan of full sour pickles (but that's more of a personal preference than criticism).

We'd been seated at a corner window table in what I'd call cushioned solarium armchairs. As I take my comfort seriously (and a bad chair can ruin a good meal), I was so pleased to see how relaxed I felt. Definitely necessary for digestion.

Finally, when it came to demolishing the leftovers (over two meals ... but I wasn't complaining), I found that the onion rings - though right out of the fridge - were still crispy and great-tasting. As was the meat and the thick slices of rye (which made me nostalgic for the good old days). The fries? Should have been reheated in an oven, but I just didn't feel like bothering.

I'd like to return to try items other than deli (and perhaps order onion rings and a smoked meat with extra coleslaw to go) but, as it's out of the way, don't know when I'll get the chance. Perhaps another holiday weekend?"}
{"text":"Always fresh and well prepared food. You really feel welcome in this well run, family restaurant. We come for business lunch occasionally."}
{"text":"Hi,

My wife and I have been to Peters several times and have found the service and food to bee very good.

Keep up the great work.

Regards,

RJ Smith"}
{"text":"Good place to come to eat when you have a good appetite or hungry. The food portion are big. I at the fish n chips, the fish was lightly battered. I ate there with the family. The rest of my family at the corn beef sandwiches. Get the regular size one unless you are super hungry."}
{"text":"This place is so good. The service was fast and helpful. Portion size was huge and so tasty. I will be going there on a reg base now that I moved into the area."}
{"text":"We had the chicken primavera and Caesar salad. 
Both were fresh, very well prepared and came in huge potions."}
{"text":"Family had a craving for smoked meat sandwiches. We were around Square One at the time so did a quick check online on best smoked meat sandwiches in Mississauga and found Peter's just around the corner. Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon. Place was busy but not crowded. Decor was impressive and comfortable. Staff was warm and receptive. Menu was quite extensive. Had everything on it but was only interested in the Montreal smoked meat (this time). Sandwiches were massive. Meat was hot, tender, fresh and tasty. Platter came with cole slaw, french fries or potatoes and a pickle spear. Plates were large and overflowing. Everything was made to order so came nice and hot to the table along with Keanes mustard and malt vinegar. Perfect choice for a Saturday lunch in February. Next time (there will be a next time) perhaps the souvlaki???"}
{"text":"Great place to go with family and friends.  It was quite and experience as the place is unique and the service is excellent.  The plates are huge and the food was tasty.  We could not finish our meal as it comes with bread, soup and salad to start so we had leftovers to take home.  Will be going back to try the deli sandwiches for sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing everything old school done right!! The best deli and restaurant in gta hands down"}
{"text":"Went to Pete's again and it was a lot
Of food.  It's definitely a family restaurant and great comfort food. Te chicken brochette is definitely enough or 2 people to share. I love it here. It's home away from home."}
{"text":"Would recommend giving it a try. 
Large portions and good flavour, a tad pricey ($30) for two having shared the large pork souvlaki (lots meat, rice, potato, tomato, and salad), took home some leftovers too! Bread and butter were served while we waited for the food which didn't take too long.
The other dishes looked tasty too, (had a peak of the monstrous smoked meat sandwich and fish and chips on the table across from me) 

I personally didn't mind the out of date styling of the place, and the older waitresses who have a more friendly service than \"professional\" which also made for a cozy relaxed setting."}
{"text":"The food here is great; the corned beef was huge and overflowing. The fries and coleslaw were good too. The waiter, an older French man, on the other hand, was condescending. \"Do you want coffee?\" he asks in an exasperated tone. He took the condiments off my table after I used them and put them on the table beside me, which was occupied by another couple, for them to use. He didn't even do it discretely either. He would fill the water, and when thanked, just walk away silently. When it came time for the bill, he disappeared and left us sitting for 15 minutes while he talked to tables around us. One woman at the neighbouring table asked him, (he was their waiter as well) what the soup of the day was and he just walked away, came back a minute later and brusquely told her. He didn't go to ask anyone, because I watched him wander away with his hands behind his back. I wasn't impressed by his service and it was reflected in the tip. In fact when a member of our party remarked that he thought the waiter had gotten lost (jokingly) because of the long wait for the bill, the waiter replied with \"Oh, is that what you think, do you?\". Perhaps I shouldn't be surprised that he didn't even acknowledge us when we left.  I really liked the food, but would be wary of going back in case I got the same waiter. He has this air of superiority that just isn't justified. I'm the customer, you're the staff. Lose the attitude."}
{"text":"Huge amounts of food. Go here if you want to eat a lot for a decent price and have a meal for the next day as well. A friend had the \"small\" pork souvlaki and it came with 5 sticks of pork, a whole potato, rice and tons of Greek salad. All for $16.95. The food itself was not that good, as the pork was rather dry and the salad was soggy. 

Other items we had include:
The lasagna, which was way too salty and presented on the plate as what can be described as a \"splat\". 
Fish and chips were ok, fish was fried just right but the chips tasted like they came out of a TV dinner.

Restaurant was very busy on the Sunday night we went. There was a wait at the door, but we had a reservation so the wait was minimal for us. The crowd was mostly retirees and families with children. Decor was old style with a massive stained glass \"thing\" on the ceiling of the restaurant.
 
All in all, I would say this is somewhere you go for huge portions of food court quality food. And washrooms only have 1 stall (is this even legal?), so satisfy your needs before you head in."}
{"text":"GIGANTIC portions!  Seriously.  HUGE portions.  

Delicious food.  Terrific service.  Our kids say that they feel like they are eating on the Titanic; the decor is quite something (tongue in cheek).  

We've been a few times and will be back again and again."}
{"text":"This is my second time to Mississauga and I have gone to Peters both times after searching for the best local places to eat. Both times I chose to do carry out. The person taking the order was friendly and prompt. The food for carry out is put together after you order but doesn't take long at all. The portions are very large. I have had the corned beef and smoked meat both being some of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"A very family feel to this restaurant - definitely not a place where you go if you want a light meal. As most posters noted, the portions are just out of this world large. Like you could feed several people with a couple of orders. Most of the people in our group got stuff to go because they were ready to explode after all that food.

Portions are large indeed - but very tasty. There were three types of meals in our group - the small souvlaki plate (\"small\" - 3 massive pieces), the halibut fish and chips (the two pieces of fish were massive but because fish is light most people managed to actually finish it) and the carbonara pasta (one big guy in our group fought with it for 30 minutes and it looked as if he barely touched it. It was literally a massive pile). 

While at the end nobody could move anymore - reality is that everyone enjoyed the flavour. They don't skimp on the ingredients and make sure you are in for a treat. Prices are really reasonable as well given the size of the portions. Nice place, although the decor is a bit on the tacky side..."}
{"text":"A Classic in Mississauga. Portions are out of this world , Food is generally served quick along with friendly service. Real Nostalgic Spot in the GTA

Pork Souvlaki and the Halibut are my favorite on the menu"}
{"text":"Great family restaurant...well organized with experienced staff...
As mentioned before...portions are huge to say the least...priced reasonable for the quantity...
Overall a nice dining experience without having to wait forever to get a table...even though the dining room was packed..."}
{"text":"Food taste is ok but the portions are huge. You will leave with a take away container"}
{"text":"I love this place! The first few times I came here with people, I have to admit I wasn't very open minded and I was a bit judgemental. The thing with peter's is, you need to take it at face value. There are plenty of places that have sleek, modern, beautiful decor and high end food. This isn't one of those places, and it doesn't need to be. The ingredients are fresh, the meat is surprisingly good (fyi I've only ever eaten the pork souvlaki so I can't speak to any other meat items), the calamari is good (well fried, fresh, not rubbery). We had onion rings today and they were ok, but the oil was overdue for a change. 
The Greek salad is a hodge podge of ingredients- cabbage, radishes, green peppers- along with the red onion, black olives, tomatoes. It's weird, but it oddly works. Obviously not so authentic, but good nonetheless. 
The decor is weird and dated, but the restaurant itself is super clean. I think they just don't get caught up in the idea of updating and competition, because they have a steady following and they don't need to worry about that stuff. It's refreshing. The food comes out quickly and the wait staff are friendly and work as a team. 
Portions are massive. It's fine, I like leftovers. We take our uneaten plates to go (there's usually more left over than eaten, lol!), and I bring it to lunch at work the next day. 
I don't eat here often, but we were starving and at least we know that Peter's is always consistent. More than I can say for most of the places out there these days. 
Tip- don't over order! Most of the time I just pick off my husband's plate and it's more than enough. If I get my own pork souvlaki dinner, I skip the rice and potato, as it comes with a salad anyway and it's a lot of food. 
They're also not stingy with their tsaziki- if you need more, they'll bring you all you need. I like to take home an extra bit for my leftovers."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have always been curious of this place as the parking lot is always packed come dinnertime. We stopped in one day to see what the fuss was all about and ordered the large pork souvlaki dinner since we were both starving. Perhaps a minor mistake; it was approximately the serving size of 2.5 meals for us. The portions are quite generous and the meal was quite delicious. The only qualms we have of the restaurant are the servers. They kept bumping into our chairs as we were close to the walkway and they did not apologize. It was quite an annoyance throughout the course of the meal."}
{"text":"Best smoked meat sandwich, with fries and gravy, in Mississauga.

Beware the Super, it is huge and should be considered a meal for two, you ahve been warned.

Period."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today with my family. The 6 of us ordered 2 garlic breads with cheese, 1 French onion soup, 2 small souvlaki dinners, 1 banquet burger (beef burger with cheese and bacon) and a 2piece halibut fish and chips. The total order was about $115. 

First things first, you get a LOT of food per order. At the end of our meal we brought home 2 boxes of leftover food. For the souvlaki you only have 1 option which is pork. I dont mind pork but prefer chicken. They should add this option. 

The garlic bread was nothing special, your regular garlic bread. The fish and chips came with a mushroom soup which was tasty. The fish was very good and flaky. The souvlaki dinner included 1 whole potato, rice, salad and the meat. 

The burger was huge but the bun seemed a little stale. Wouldn't reorder. The staff is friendly and the decor is very dated but I guess it gives you that family-old-school kind of vibe. 

Overall, if you are hungry and in the mood to share 1 meal, this restaurant is good. Personally, not a favourite for me."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible food. Honestly, it's not worth going into details. Whatever we have ordered over 2 visits have been well below par.

I was requested details. Here goes. Last visit:

- Spanish omelette: The vegetables were mixed in some tomatoe sauce-ish brown stuff inside the folds of the omelette, which was over done. Hence, is was like eating curry in rubber.

- Smoked meat sandwich: Quality was below par. The texture of the meat was \"crumbly\", not the smooth texture found in good smoked meat. It appeared to be heated on a grill, as opposed to being steamed. Hence, it was quite oily.

Previous visit:

- Chicken souvlaki dinner. The small portion was actually of a good size. However, it had way too much garlic and the salad had large chunks of lettuce. Over priced for the quality. A cheap version at a chain like \"Villa Madina\" is a better option."}
{"text":"The chicken souvlaki dinner is amazing! MASSIVE portion and very delicious. The staff is great and the atmosphere is nice too. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This is a staple amongst Mississauga especially for Greek food. My family and I have been going for years. The portions are massive! We always take the food as leftovers. If you don't want to do that, I recommend you share with someone. We usually get the chicken or beef platter. 

The food is good, nothing out of the ordinary for Greek food and the service is a bit slow and they're not super friendly."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, most recently today. Today we had the fish and chips, Turkey club, small Souvlaki plate and rice pudding for desert. The fish and chips was very mediocre, and over-priced at $17 dollars a portion although they do use halibut which was nice. Their portions are really big and all three of us left with 50-70% of our food uneaten. Don't be fooled though, you are definetly charged for all of that extra food. Turkey club with fries is about $20 which is excessive. Service was okay today, they brought bread to the table but it was cold. The server was nice and the over all decor of the restaurant is not bad although it looks like it's right out of an 80's movie set. Overall, not an unpleasant experience but not somewhere you would eat at regularly....unless you are always really really really hungry!"}
{"text":"This place can be summed up as a provider of large quantities of good food for a reasonable price. The food is tasty too. I like going here, especially for the oversized smoked meat sandwiches, souvlaki, and super combo meals. The French onion soup is a favourite too. The 10oz steak and halibut Steak are worth trying. The interior of the place is tacky, but the food is good and cheap. I give it a 4/5."}
{"text":"OMG!! I freaking love this place.   I can't say the decor or ambiance is great but the food is amazing! ! Their Greek salad comes with an array of veggies and the most delicious dressing that I think of often when eating other salads lololol and I highly recommend the Chicken en Brochette - the chunks of chicken are perfectly flavored and cooked served on a bed of veggie rice, a greek salad and lemon potato.  I can't wait to go back.  A bit pricey but the portions are huge. Try this meal and you will be in foodie heaven :)"}
{"text":"Good food. Large portions. $60 for 3 adults to eat. All chose off the deli menu. Very busy. Fast service"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch and was forewarned that the portions are very generous. Although I could have ordered their fish and chips (which is apparently what they're known for), I opted for the Greek salad wanting something light. Unfortunately, the salad was drenched in dressing. It was more like I ordered a bowl of dressing with a bit of lettuce on the side. I couldn't eat it. 
Service on the other hand was great and the dining room was really cute. I liked the atmosphte. I would come back again but probably not order the Greek salad!"}
{"text":"I chose 1-star because it's described as \"Eek! Methinks not.\"  I cannot recommend Peter's on Eglinton after my two experiences here in the last 6 months after finding it on Yelp and seeing the favourable reviews.  My experience during both of my visits have me shaking my head wondering why people rave about this place, and why it was packed both times that I was there.

The food is standard deli fare; for deli food I find the prices wayyyyyy too high.  Yes, the portions are huge, but I would rather have a smaller portion of exception food than a huge portion of average food.  To each his own.  I did not order the deli sandwiches which reviewers spoke so highly about; the restaurant has a huge menu so perhaps the highlight is the deli meat which looks delicious and folks rave about.  For sure stay away from the Greek Salad which was practically inedible because it was drowning in so much dressing.  The lasagna was well below par - tasteless and mushy.  Like a cheap frozen lasagna.  There is a very limited kids menu.  Another person in my party had the chicken brochettes (like chicken souvlaki) - they looked delicious but at a cost of $30 which is expensive (though the portion was huge).

I found the person who greeted us to be quite rude; shockingly I was told it is the owner's son.  You would think they would know better.  Problem started when I arrived at 5:01 for our 5 pm dinner reservation and announced myself, his response was \"you're early, the table is not ready\" when in fact I was right on time.  I didn't mind waiting a bit but don't tell me I'm early and blame it on me.  Set a bad tone from the beginning.

The decor is very dated.  Definitely a throwback. The waitress was proud to tell us the menu has not changed since they opened the restaurant decades ago.  Not sure that's something to brag about.

I will not return to overspend on mediocre food in a dated dining room."}
{"text":"half of me HATES THIS PLACE, the other half LOVES THIS PLACE. I've come 3 different times.

Everytime i've come its been 99% people over the age of 60... including that staff..seriously. And the greeters are awful.. Tell you to come in, puts the menu on your table and walks away...like ok?

I went last night and i got the pork souvlaki. it was amazing!! 26 dollars and its enough for 3-4 people BUT you have to add 5 dollars to share.. which i think is BS. the food is amazing, i have no complaints about any of the food i've ever gotten, other than the price but honestly its justified because the portions are so big.

What bothers me is the service. I understand the wait staff is old but pretend you care?? Last night there was a fly in my water so i asked for a new one and she just took it and walked away.. said NOTHING back to me when she came back she put it down and left again. Not a sorry or anything, its like she was mad at me?

every time i've come i've waited FOREVER for my bill once we finished eating.... yesterday we had been sitting for 10 minutes before someone came to take our plate and ask me if i wanted anything. I asked for the bill and it didnt come to us for another 10 minutes... 

last, everything in there is so OLD. not only the staff but the cutlery/ plates / tables / decorations. You feel like your in your great grandparents house when eating here.....

i rated it two stars but i would still recommend everyone try it out for atleast the food....

Souvlaki or Montreal smoked meat sandwich !!! you cant go wrong,

Goodluck (;"}
{"text":"Portion size.  Go there just to take a picture of the ridiculous amount of food that is presented for your meal!  You really can't fault them for the value of the meals as they certainly don't skimp on the ingredients!  

I had the 'small' pork souvlaki which was three generous sticks of pork (decent, if a bit dry and very flavourful), a whole Greek style potato (yummiest part of the platter), fragrant rice (super oily - there was oil pooling around the edges), and a Greek salad that was drenched in dressing and feta.  Very good value at $14.95 for what you get, but because of the amount of oil and fatty not-goodness, it was a bit much to stomach.  Others had fish and chips, corned beef sandwich, etc.  All incredulous portion sizes that have to be seen to be believed.  Left overs are a guarantee if you're an average eater. 

We were a party of 13 and I have to say that all the food came fairly quickly.  The menu is a bit of everything - all pretty much heavy offerings (fried, breaded, creamy, cheesy...) and nothing that stood out particularly for me.  The service was brisk and efficient.  The decor was definitely... old school?  Dark colours, heavy chairs that could have come from someone's grandmother's parlour.  The restaurant is definitely 'family', 'value', and a bit of 'blast from the past'.

Overall, I can't say that this is the type of restaurant food that I particularly enjoy.  They didn't specialize in anything and everything was a bit heavy-handed.  I wouldn't recommend not going there, but I just don't think that this place is for me."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years and the food is always amazing, filling and well priced. The staff is very friendly as well :) The only thing us that it can get very busy at times but it's worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Great place to take friends and family. Staffs are really nice and the foods are amazing. Must try the pork souvlaki... Large or small, it's just  delicious. Other than souvlaki, the fish and chips, smoke meat sandwich, BLT are awesome too. 

The only thing I don't recommend is the pasta. The pasta itself is overcooked. The plate is hot but the middle of the pasta was warm-cold. 

They also have all day breakfast selection on the menu... Haven't have a chance to try it because this place is to have some great souvlaki! I don't mind the portion is huge. Love to eat the leftover the next day... Still taste juicy!"}
{"text":"Great value and excellent service. The portions here are huge, but quality is not sacrificed. This is wholesome fare and service is relaxed and informal although professional at all times. The restaurant is popular and has a regular clientele.
The menu is wide ranging and caters for all tastes although I cannot vouch for the availability of specialist dietary needs. Plenty of parking is available locally and access for mobility impaired people is easy, with large washrooms and enough space.
This isn't a fancy or overly intimate restaurant, it has a family friendly feel and very good food and service at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant.. Walking in, you would swear you time traveled back to the 70's in your grandmas house... Stained glass everywhere.. busy wallpaper, wicker chairs.. \"older\" waiters and waitresses. Don't let the decor sway you, because you must eat here. This place can either be SUPER busy or quiet depending on the day and time.. Sunday afternoon lunch is super busy (after church crowd). The menu is huge. From my personal experience I recommend the Halibut fish and chips. The breading is light and crispy, the fish not too \"fishy\" - you get 2 large pieces of fish, lots of fries and a mountain of coleslaw. They have great coleslaw, very creamy. The house made tartar sauce is my favorite of any restaurant I've been to.  They also have really good gravy.  Another specialty here is the deli sandwiches.  Huge mounds of pastrami or corned beef or smoked meat, so big you can barely get your mouth around it. If you get the larger size it is almost a ridiculous amount of meat, I would be amazed to see the person who could eat it all.  The souvlaki is huge chunks of tender meat, perfectly seasoned..again HUGE portion.  Most meals come with a starter soup, which is made in house and always tasty with the bread basket bread dipped in it.  They tend to be creamy soups, cream of chicken, cream of asparagus, but sometimes a hearty chicken noodle.  I have never had dessert here, because we are always too stuffed to even consider it.  The service has always been great. Go with an appetite!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this, drawn by the interior and crowds of people. Nice diner with huge portions! Tastes great :)"}
{"text":"We had dinner there last night and when our plates came, OMG!  I got the small pork dinner and it will last me two more meals, and it was so good.  My husband got the fisherman platter and had to take some home too.  So, go hungry and you won't be disappointed in the very flavorful food that they serve."}
{"text":"Portion was large, staff was very plesent ! Window vie is great. I little outdated decor, but clean. Would come here again!"}
{"text":"Heard of this place from a friend, went there with a friend around 3:00pm in the afternoon after lunch, just ordered two coffees. I felt the waitress was unhappy and said \"that's it?!\" loudly, when she put the coffee on the table carelessly, my friend's coffee was splashed on the plate, didn't know whether she did it on purpose and didn't even provide us any tissue. Despite the rudeness, we chatted happily. After a while, the lady came and gave us the bill without asking! Was it a sign to leave? Anyway, for the $3.90's coffee, I decided to give her $5.00 tip as a joke of the rude service and asked for a tissue, this time, she asked me if I wanted one more.

Anyway, maybe it was my fault, we shouldn't order only coffee though. I would give it another try for a meal next time to see how it goes......"}
{"text":"Ok so after only 2 visits to this place I have officially cut this off my list of restaurants.
I am not going to comment or review the look of the place.  At the end of the day I go to a restaurant for the quality of the food and NOT what the restaurant looks like.

First Visit: We ordered the Calamari to start the portion was insane.  They were fried and tasty.  A bit rubbery but non the less they were alright.  I then had the smoked meat sandwich.  It was tasty.  The problem came after when I got home.  I was up all night in the bathroom.  My stomach was destroyed.

Second Visit:  Again we orderd the Calamari.  Same as above.  I then ordered the Souvlaki on a bun.  Again the portions were huge and the food was very tasty.  The issue again started once I got home.  I was even more sick then the first time up all night in the bathroom.

To sum it all up the food and the portions were good but at the end of the day ANY restaurant that keeps me up at night 2 times in a row is CUT OFF."}
{"text":"the food is good, good bang for your buck, simple menu but the last time I went there i ordered a large souvlaki dinner (also it was  a b-day party for one of our friends (approx 12 people)) it took over an hour to get my food by the time i got it i lost my appetite. They said it took so long because of the portion size, they were right it was like a small roast....a little too much for me and for anybody.....i'm a fairly large man 6 foot and 230 lbs,,,,so if its big for me guess what????anyways the moral to the story is the waiter should of let me know about the portion and the lenght of time to get my food...will not go back until i forget my bad experience...."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at Peter's, both the quality and quantity of my food was excellent! 
My group and I were seated in a booth which was nice. The decor of the restaurants interior was a little strange, there was a stain glass chandelier thing aha! What's important though is that everything was clean which was great. 
Our waitress promptly served us giving us water, complimentary buns, and took our food orders.
I ordered the \"small\" pastrami sandwich that came with a side of fries and fresh, house-made coleslaw. When looking at the menu and seeing the price of about 16 bucks, I thought that was a little steep, but upon receiving my sandwich and seeing the enormous size of it, it was more than worth the price! I used some of the complimentary buns to make mini sandwiches and share with my group haha. Even after sharing, I was still left with more than half of my sandwich to take home as leftovers :)
My boyfriend ordered a delicious open faced roast beef sandwich. I tried a bit, the beef was soo tendy, and the flavour of the gravy was spot on. 
If you're looking for a huuugggeee meal, pay a visit here, you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love this resturant...been many times..impossible to eat all and always leave with leftovers..great service just love Kristina..fast service and don't let a waiting line make u leave ..they are quick to get u a table.."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a huge corned beef, pastrami, or Montreal smoked meat sandwich this is the place. It is definitely quantity over quality.  So if you like Epic meal time and getting the Meat sweats, you'll enjoy.

I usually do takeout, dining in is painful, harsh staff, and long waiting, can be a busy place."}
{"text":"Servings in this place are HUGE and great for sharing. However, if you are sharing a dish you better order a side of fries or a bowl of soup. Otherwise, they will charge you for splitting the one dish. I always get the small souvlaki dinner when I go there because it it delicious! My friend ordered the fish and chips and apparently it was good too.  Service was also very good.  This is a place worth going to."}
{"text":"The comments about the decor and servers are fairly accurate. The food is very tasty and the portions are enormous. We usually shares and this works out well. We typically get the corned beef sandwich and it's always very tasty. Last time I got the Greek salad and it was very good. Prices are high but because we share, it works out to be reasonable."}
{"text":"Their food is great, large souvlaki chicken or pork chucks on a huge bed of rice, potatoes and salad. Their bass fish is bigger than the actual plate itself and can be lunch and dinner. Actually most of their fishes would be enough for 2 meals. 

They are busy most days for lunch and dinner, so make sure you make a reservation! Although my first time there it didn't make a difference as we still had to wait a half hour. The wait staff didn't seem interested in letting us know we wouldn't be getting our table anytime soon. After my sister in law asked the manager, we were checked in with 2 or 3 times while the table before us were paying and being cleaned. 

That to me want enough to put me off because you can't help how long the customers stay.  The only reason I'm giving them 3 stars is because of their service. My mom's potatoes had a tiny hair on it,  looked like an eyelash. When I politely brought it to the servers attention she scoffed and rolled her eyes because claiming it was rosemary. She did this without even looking at it.  I explain to her I know what rosemary looks like and I was 100% sure this was hair.  She literally laughed at us before picking up the plate and saying is rosemary but she'll exchange the dish for us.  No apology,  nothing.  My sister was furious and when she came back I think she noticed the mood for my brothers birthday dinner had turned sour. So then she proceeded to make a joke that my mom should buy the lottery since she was lucky enough to get 1 stand of hair on her food. Then she started squeezing my sister's shoulders.  

I'm not sure what to make of this but the meal want really enjoyable after that. No manager or anyone else came by after that until we got our bill.

I went there 1 other time afterwards for lunch and the service was equally bad. It's unfortunate because their food is really good, tzatziki is thick and seems fresh. 

Prices are hefty but the portions are good. Hopefully other patrons don't get the service we do and enjoy the pork souvlaki."}
{"text":"Went to Peter's for lunch, been going there for sometime, but to day the food was not up to par, very disappointed. Service was excellent and they tried to make amends with our order by having another portion  of sole re done, but still not a very good meal all round, rather tasteless and greasy. I feel rather bad for saying this but possibly it is a new chef as it not their norm!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch 2 weeks ago on a Friday after some conversation about Smoked Meat. We had 8 and arrived shortly after noon without a reservation. Place was very busy as expected but there was a table available for us on arrival. Peter's has an old school Greek vibe and we were warned by some who had been before that portions were massive. This menu is basically comfort food. They have a good selection of deli selection, burgers, steaks, souvlaki, etc... I ( and half of the table) ended up ordering the smoked meat sandwich. I had a large which was absolutely massive, and comes with a whole dill pickle. The smoked meat was very good, they have hot mustard which I didn't try but others at our table said it was great with their sandwiches. Others on the table order the Reuben, French onion soup, chicken salad sandwich, which they said were all good. Good food in a friendly environment, I'll be back. Note: a little pricey for lunch, but do ask about their specials which can be great value!"}
{"text":"Geezer land. This is your grandma's go to hotspot. Ever since our family started going to restaurants in Canada it has been f'n peter's on mf wording eglinton.. The food is legit but damn I'm sick of this place. I don't think they changed their decor since they open their doors in the early 1900s. Anyway if you're only into the food, then come here. If you're into discussing your arthritis pain with the table next to yours then I'd make a reservation."}
{"text":"Literally driving by and wondered why the parking lot was crowded so we just followed fellow fat people into Peter's. Minh our server was great and patient. Large quantities, food was okay. On the expensive side. Many people took leftovers home. Definitely will go again."}
{"text":"Wish they could give less food and reduce the price. Their portions are ridiculously huge. My meal could easily feed 2.5 people. I got smoked meat sandwich which came with fries, coleslaw, and a pickle. Smoked meats were juicy, just the way I like it. I was happy with my order. If you want to share a plate, you have to pay for it (I have never seen this system before, but their portions are indeed shareable). In the end, I could have gotten two \"regular\" sized sandwiches at other places at the same price. So I would rather go elsewhere for less food at a cheaper price. 

Overall, if you want to get overwhelmed by the amount of food, this is the place. Food tastes good, but nothing memorable. This place has a retro vibe to it which I enjoyed."}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck in the GTA!  Always had a great time eating at Peter's!  Portion sizes are second to none and always end up leaving with a take out container!  Fish & Chips are amazing, there is enough meat in the beef brisket sandwich to feed 4 people!  Souvlaki dinners are the most popular here and worth the try!"}
{"text":"Just outstanding! Been coming here for 20 years and you can say I have never been disappointed! Everything on the menu is amazing"}
{"text":"Driving up Eglinton, it's hard to miss 'Peter's on Eglinton'. Just like the name says, it's right on Eglinton looking circa 1910. The restaurant looks like it raided an old cruise ship and took anything that was in one or more pieces.

That was enough to convince me.

Sadly, when you walk in, that's where the excitement ends. Right away, you're made to guess between two doors on either side, not sure which leads where. We pick left and open the door to see a man, sitting at a table, staring back at us. Another man comes and says \"I'm putting you in the booth.\" Fair enough, I think aloud. I follow him.

The wife and I take our seats and we look over the menu. They do everything for everybody - one of my biggest pet peeves. We decide we're not that hungry and we'll split a meal. (This is most definitely the wrong place for that, but more on that soon.) We're told by the waitress that it'll be $5 extra if the lady doesn't order something herself. We go with the Caesar salad. 

Since we weren't too hungry, we get a serving for one. When it came, it was so big that neither of us could finish it. To go with our meal of too much, we ordered a smoked meat sandwich. We were warned it would be big, but not so comically big. 

The amount of meat shoved in between inch-thick slices of bread was bigger than my fist. I had about 2-3 bites before getting any bread. The fries were stacked just as high, along with the coleslaw.

Needless to say, it tasted like I took a bite out of a ham, rather than ate a sandwich. The stomach aches were not worth it. I was hoping to get out and call it a night, but the waitress was nowhere to be found. 

Full disclosure: It was a Saturday night. However, there were only 3 tables, including us, in the entire restaurant to serve. I could hear the waitress chatting it up in the back as we sit, holding our stomachs, waiting to be set free. 

She finally came about 10 minutes later and had a wireless Visa pinpad with the chip reader - easily the newest piece of technology in the place by 70-80 years or so. We paid and called it a night. 

Our date was over. Neither of us had the stomach to smile through the pain. I promptly went home and curled into a ball, hoping to forget the experience."}
{"text":"This is the definition of family eatery. I have been coming to this restaurant since I was 5yrs old. The owners are the same owners from when the restaurant first opened!! If you want one of the best Montreal smoked meat sandwiches grab a table. The portions are so big, I dare you to finish them. 

Greek owner Peter and his family are not just behind the scenes in the kitchen but are often found walking around asking customers how they're enjoying their meals. Talk about customer service. Oh and did I mention the souvlaki? Unless you are Fred Flinstone don't bother ordering a large! You really can't go wrong with anything you order here. My favourite part surprisingly are the classic Greek potatoes :) but then again I'm more a potatoes kinda girl. Dessert is no different. If they have in stock their famous chocolate pecan pie, it is a must! With ice cream but of course. Don't forget to asked them to warm it up for you. 

The breakdown... If you're looking for a friendly family atmosphere, great food and quality service. Look no further. It is one of the few Gems in Mississauga and has no intentions of going anywhere. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The large souvlaki dinner is insanely large and quite tasty. I started with the French onion soup which was also very good but not the best I've ever had. I'd almost consider this place to be a sort of sit-down version of Zet's, but I'd give the edge to Zet's for better food overall. That in no way takes away from Peter's though. Great place!"}
{"text":"Stopped in because we were looking for a place with a diverse menu. When I walked up to door, a gentleman that appeared to be dressed like a member of the wait staff was outside. I asked what kind of food they served and he lit up like a Christmas tree. \"Good food!\" He said. \"We have soup, salads, pasta...\" Turns out, I had just met Peter and he was right. The soup of the day was Cream of Chicken with Asparagus and it was fantastic. We ordered a little of everything - Chicken Parm, Penne pasta Arrabiata, Reuben sandwich, Chicken Wings and all were very good. Portion sizes were HUGE. We were able to wrap up half the serving to take home. We will go back just for the soup alone and to see Peter. He was great."}
{"text":"I was told to try peters on eglinton so I did ...
Came on a Friday evening , the place was pretty busy . It seemed to be an older clientele a lot older ! 
Maybe it was seniors night ..I dunno ? 
Anyways , that's fine , that's no problem ..
I'm here to eat,  not meet woman right ! 
So I sit down and get greeted by an older waiter gentlemen and he said hello young people !! LoL 
Seemed friendly ...
I order the liver and my date the pasta Arabiatta 
The food came fairly quickly for being busy ,
The portions are massive like massive massive ..
The taste is mediocre I mean it is decent don't get me wrong more then decent just a little tiny bit bland but decent ...
To be fair for the portions and amount you get it's good ..but then again who can eat so much ? 
Anyways here's my opinion .

Service - 8
Food -7
Quality -7
Taste - 7
Atmosphere -7"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite restaurant! My immediate and extended family, and I have been going here for well over a decade. The food is always fantastic. They have enormous portions for a very reasonable price. Their SMALL souvlaki dinner is actually so big that you will be going home with a doggy bag, and it's only like $20. I've been tempted to get the Large on occasion, but It always comes with a warning because it's so massive. The waitress will usually says, \"You know the large has two pounds of meat!\", then I think about it and opt for the \"small\". 

     I should say that I'm a big guy and can eat my fair share, but I still leave this place with a lot of left overs. The calamari appetizer is a meal in itself. Their fish and chips include two HUGE pieces of fish a ton of fries, and it's honestly one of the best fish & chips I've ever had. I'm not a huge Montreal smoked meat/Reuben sandwich kind of guy, but here they're delicious, and packed with so much meat that you actually have to take meat out of the sandwich just to get your mouth around it! It's amazing.

     I could go on and on about the menu, the quality of the food and the fantastic service, but I'll try to keep it short and just say that I HIGHLY recommend this place.

     One word of warning, there are some Yelp reviews by people who actually didn't like this place. All I can say is, if you're a wimp who's probably more accustomed to suit & tie restaurants where you're served a thimble full of asparagus with a warm water for your delicate tummy, and followed up with a bill of $150, then you probably won't like this place. If, however, you're a real human being who loves amazing food, fantastic services, and excellent value, then you'll LOVE Peter's!"}
{"text":"I actually went here after a recommendation from a friend. He said \"you gotta try the smoked meat at Peter's\". Well I did and I think that friend is no longer allowed to give food advice. 

Upon entering you'll notice that you've entered a room that's a cross between grandmas and a steakhouse. Then you'll notice that everyone has a mountain of food in front of them. 

Yes it's ridiculous the amount of food you get per serving here. 1 order for 2 people should be enough for lunch.  

I ordered the smoke meat sandwich (nothing on the side) as recommended and what came out was a mountain of meat. Seriously this thing was about 1ft of towering smoked meat with two measly pieces of bread hanging on for dear life. 

The sandwich as big yes, but size isn't everything. The sandwich sucked, it was like freezer deli meat in a sandwich. The sandwich was overly salty and the consistency was that of a microwaved or warmed up sandwich that dripped with oil. Bah. 

If I came back here I probably wouldn't order this again.  Maybe the fish and chips."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go with my family. The atmosphere is so nice and the staff is amazing. The food is delicious and doesn't disappoint. Expect to leave full because the servings are huge. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"A local favourite! HUGE portions for your buck. Service is from an era bygone, which means it's much better than the service you get at most restaurants. 

Do your self a favour and try it out. And bring an appetite!"}
{"text":"Really good food, HUGE portions, price a little on the higher side but well worth it!

Their desserts are not bad either. Would definitely recommend this place for local Mississauga Greek food."}
{"text":"This place is unreal. No jokes. 

Always a line up
Always great food

The Ruben is to die for

He Cole slaw is perfect

Can never finish their entire meal

Pastrami and the corned beef is always fresh. Even their pickles are amazing. 

I have NEVER been disappointed in 7 years of coming here. 

You got to eat here."}
{"text":"Classic, exceptional diner. Service and food, both top notch.

Peter's is exactly what a Greek diner should aspire to be."}
{"text":"For smoked meat, there simply is no better place in Mississauga or Toronto. Peters has been a staple for smoked meat and huge portions since I can remember. The service is great, the food is tasty and most people are walking out with doggy bags.

The interior is a bit dated, however charming, especially for a place along a very industrialized part of Eglinton. I think you can split any entree with two people and both be fully satisfied. The smoked meat combo, for example, features a huge smoked meat sandwich that will easily satisfy two average weight humans and it comes with a lot of fries and coleslaw for $15.95. If you're on a a budget, this has got to be one of the best deals.

The beef sandwich is about 5 inches thick and would probably feed 3 people. Of course first timers would never believe it and place individual orders. Everything I have had there, including scallops and ribs, are excellent and once again, the service has been consistent there for the ore than 15 years that I have been going there."}
{"text":"Came here a couple days ago for a late (very late) christmas party for my work. As soon as we came here we got the vibe as a old school family restaurant kind of thing. Greeted right as we walked in, made u feel kinda cozy actually. 


We had previously had reservations for about 15 ppl and actually only about 10 were able to show up. Not a problem, they sat us down right away. Our waitress was very nice and kind of persistant, always checking up on us. When it was time to order i noticed the prices are maybe a bit tad pricey ($19-35 for the entrees) but iv heard their portions are really big so you get your moneys worth. I ordered the regular pork souvlaki dinner which comes with alot of pork, seasoned rice, potatoes and greek salad, although i substituted mine for a caesar...no biggie. I loved my plate...it was a huge plate and the pork was well seasoned. My friend ordered the fettucine alfredo with ham....huge, tasty and very saucy, she gave me some of hers...cant complain. My other friend ordered the haddock and chips...the fish was moist and although it was fried it wasnt dry...i heard the coleslaw was awesome. We ended up taking our food home which meant breakfast for the next day...yay. I would so come here again...but maybe with my family for a nice sunday dinner..its not really a place where you can bring your friends. I\"ll be back to try their sandwiches which i heard are really good."}
{"text":"Great joint. .no matter how long it takes in between visits, I find the same service same great food same people. ..well done. .great value always."}
{"text":"I was in town, and I stopped by twice.  I ate in, and also took out.  Both were great experiences....will go back again!  (I had both the smoked meat and pastrami sandwiches)"}
{"text":"It's more like a 3.5*. This is a decent & very busy restaurant. The portion sizes are GIANT but since the last time I was there the prices have taken a dramatic jump! Both wife & I had the small Pork Souvlaki. They were very tasty & come with a side salad w creamy garlic salad dressing. Comes w fresh buns as well. No complaints  about the food but the service was a little slow, guess u can chalk that up to how busy the restaurant was. All-in-all...not bad."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my family, nice cozy place, the decor is nice. We didn't have to wait to be seated. We ordered fish and chips, which comes with coleslaw and pickles, french onion soup, which was really good, Pork souvlaki, comes with 2 skewers, Greek salad, half a tomato and a large potato. The servings are really big. If you are in Mississauga, do try this place."}
{"text":"I went to this place for the first time over 10years ago. I lived in Brampton and it was a place that was recommended. They served huge portions, service was very good! Food is tasty enough to be satisfied.  A few months ago, i was in mississauga for a tournament and we ended up going to a recommended restaurant nearby, as it turned out, it was Peter's on Eglinton!! I had my doubts that it would be the same experience as 10 yrs ago, but it was !!!
Very enjoyable experience !! Big portions, good service!! Quantity and Quality has not changed at all.
Highly recommended, must try. bring your appetite. The pork souvlaki dinner is as close as the \"danforth\" you can get."}
{"text":"Peter's on Eglinton serves up standard burgers, souvlaki, and smoked meat sandwiches. The decor inside is very traditional and looks like a restaurant from the 70s/80s. I came here with a few coworkers and there was a big lunch crowd of older, retired folks dining at the time.

Food overall was good. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with a side caesar salad. Servings overall are HUGE. You'll be served up with lots of salad, fries, or any other sides that you order.  If you're not too hungry, you can definitely share a meal.  While the servings were healthy, the food itself is nothing too memorable. Taste is average in the sense that there is no special sauce or touch to the food."}
{"text":"OMG--huuuugggeee sandwiches!

Went here with my family (4 people) and my dad said that we could only order two sandwiches. After being a bit skeptical that 2 sandwiches would feed the family, the waitress brought out two gigantic corned beef sandwiches.

The sandwiches are what I have come to expect from high-quality deli type restaurants and there was more than enough food to go around. The meat is so tender and flavorful and really hits the spot.

We also had a side of cole slaw that wasn't my favorite cole slaw ever, but had a nice flavors to it if you like a more vinegary-type of slaw.

Overall, the place itself is quite a site to behold, the service is first-class, and the sandwiches are monstrous. This is a great place to split a sandwich whenever you have a craving for good corned beef."}
{"text":"I have no idea why anyone would ever get a large sandwich at this place.. the regular sandwich, which comes with fries and coleslaw, is so big that I could only eat half! And for only $10! I would definitely return. 
The smoked meat itself was pretty tasty, but nothing special about the coleslaw or fries. Most food seems mediocre to above average -- nothing fantastic -- but the portion sizes are out of this world. At our table some had the sandwich, some the lasagna, and some the souvlaki and no one had a small plate -- and no one was disappointed -- and everyone left with leftovers.
Fun tip: my coworker says Hazel McCallion tends to eat here and she's seen her here a handful of times."}
{"text":"I've lived in Mississauga for decades now and Peter's is a place that I've only had the chance now to go to. I can understand why a business like them have been operating for some long but the restaurants have a few flaws but good enough I'd be willing to go back (but not for a long time).

Peter's on Eglinton serves the standard burgers/sandwiches/deli sandwiches as well as their all day breakfast.  They sell things that are standard/generic so Peter's aim is to provide value and a lot of quantity in what you order.  

There isn't much that I can say about this place, because it does do a lot of things well.  For one, I love the Victorian, old school, vintage environment of it, the seats are super comfy and the ambience of it is really nice.  

The service is excellent, the waitresses are attentive, constantly topping off water and providing the necessary condiments depending on what you ordered. So my friends ordered a chicken parm, and a reuben sandwich, while I went with an all-day breakfast, 4 egg western omelette.
The wide range of condiments from various mustards, hot sauces/chili flakes was a nice touch since a lot of places don't provide that stuff (at least not to that range).  Oh, they had dinner rolls too, and I'm a sucker for bread and butter...

The food, was hit and miss in parts.  The chicken parm and reuben sandwich, I thought were super tasty.  And before I go into the food, like I mentioned, the portions as MASSIVE.  In fact I really could only eat half of my meal before I had to ask for a take-away container.

I found my omelette, slightly over-cooked with the egg having the brown cooked edges, bordering on almost burnt.  I personally prefer them cooked a bit under.  Overall good flavour on the omelette, found the roasted potato (it was one big potato) a tad bland (needed some hot sauce with it).

Then I ordered dessert, ordered a tiramisu and I felt this was where they missed the mark.  I reckon that the tiramisu is not prepared traditionally (with lady fingers, and layering it), and it was more like an interpretation of it (using vanilla sponge cake), but I found the overall product really...dry.  The coffee taste was really faint and just wasn't cohesive of a dessert, so I thought that was a bit of letdown.

Overall, the restaurant is solid but suffers from few technicalities on the preparation/execution of food.  It won't deter from coming back but it's a great place if you have a big appetite."}
{"text":"Came here today for dinner. Got the fried calamari, wasn't all that great. Not too many options. Yeah the portions are big, but it's about quality not quantity. Kind of weird how they only do pork souvlaki, but if you want chicken it's a huge portion which is way too much for one person. Anyway, got the chicken Greek salad, was pretty unsatisfied. Way too much dressing. Huuuuuge portion for no reason. Save yourself the trip and go to Astoria instead. Much more flavourful."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times over the years and last year I'd vowed would be the  last time. When I suggested this place it was under the belief that time and other reviews would lend a valuable perspective to the operators. The food here is bulky but sometimes bigger is not better. I ordered the Reuben which was what I imagined this place might specialize in, boy was I wrong. The meat was clearly reheated cold cuts granted it was a mountain of cold cuts, but if you're going to purport to have something special then please make something for me that I can't make at home. Chicken primavera was a massive platter of box pasta(cheap) with a dressing that had the same flavor as white gravy. The chicken was way too spicy, they really need to keep the souvlaki chicken off of the pasta, because they clearly aren't supposed to be the same. I guess that there will always be a market for big flavorless food and Peter's seems to have that market cornered."}
{"text":"I believe it is almost impossible to eat an entire meal here. The portions are like nothing i've seen before - not even in the U.S. But restaurants that serve large portions usually do so at lower quality. But you won't find that at Peter's on Eglinton. 

Menu wise, this is greek meets diner. Is it unique? No. But it's the kind of place everyone in your group will enjoy because there's something for everyone.

Oh and the interior just makes it all the more better."}
{"text":"Service was great, my hubby ordered the Montreal smoked sandwich, the bread was disappointing that it was served on but the meat was delicious. I order the chicken parmigiano which was served with pasta. The portions are extremely generous. We took our left overs home. Seat were comfy and lathe with cushions. Fresh bread and butter was served and we also had a beef barley soup.to start that was yummy. Unfortunately no room to taste dessert. I will be back here."}
{"text":"The Greek salad is great and their corned beef sandwich is amazing. Service is fair.  We go quite often."}
{"text":"I passed this place a few times when going to /from work, and it always seemed busy,  so decided to check out out. 

From the jump I knew something was \"interesting\" about this place. When we walked in there were two doors,  one on the right and one on the left. No clear indication as to which to choose. We chose the one on the right,  and when we got through we still didn't get an indication that we chose correctly. No sign indicating that someone will seat us, or that we should seat ourselves. Someone met our puzzled looks with a \"table for 2?\". When we sat down, we immediately realized we were in 1989. The decor was that of an old cruise ship,  with terribly clichéd atmosphere from what appeared to be a semi formal restaurant from the late 80/early 90s. It was kind of charming at first,  but got annoying later when we realized it wasn't on purpose, but clearly an extremely out of date theme. 

After soaking in the atmosphere,  we realized that every waitress was at least 60 years old.  As we're all the patrons. Beside the little girl that came with her grandparents,  my wife and I were the youngest people in the place. Nothing against older wait staff,  but it fit the theme this place and review is heading. The menu seemed to have everything and nothing at the same time. Being billed as a deli I expected a concentrated reference to sandwiches and the like,  instead the sandwich part of the menu was more like an insert that was an added bonus to the outdated rest of the menu.  

I chose the \"beef on a kaiser\" (19.99) wanting a nice traditional deli sandwich, which came with an au jus dip,  one of my favs. The wife got got the double (2 pieces) fish and chips (23.99). We were served bread and butter while we waited for our food. Fresh bread, but not warm. Wife's ginger ale was flat and we asked for an iced tea to replace it. Side note: we were charged for both the ginger ale AND the iced tea but didn't realize until we got home and looked at the ridiculous bill. More on that later. 

The fish and chips came with a soup,  which wasn't mentioned on the menu, but we were intrigued. The waitresses were pushing the chicken noodle soup on everyone for some weird reason,  but we thought it was an added bonus. She said \"it comes with the soup. It's really good eh!\"  It wasn't. It tasted OK,  but was clearly not house made, and had ground chicken in it which I thought was weird. It also was oddly extra yellow,  which indicated a lot of powdered mix,  and had bits of ground chicken fat floating in it. 

We then got our mains and the portions were huge. My sandwich was a foot tall and we both got at least a cereal bowl portion of coleslaw, which I never eat. 

Sandwich:  Extremely dry meat. I had to dip in the au jus just to be able to chew it down. Rather tasteless as well. Kaiser bun was at least a day old,  almost stale. Fries were standard fare. Fresh cut home made, but dry, leading me to believe they were frozen for a while. Au jus tasted good, but I didn't think it was natural, seemed like it came from a powder. 

Fish and chips: Fish was good quality, but not sure what type. Tasted good, although the batter was not crispy at all. 

Overall,  food was 2.5 out of 5.  Then the bill came. And although we saw the price of the food when we ordered, it didn't hit home until we got the bill.  A little over $60 for something I could have made at home, and a lot better. 

Will not be returning and cannot recommend this to anyone else. Not sure why /how the others recommend the sandwiches here, but based on my experience, I could never compare this with any reputable deli ever. Want a good sandwich? Hit up The Corned Beef House,  downtown Toronto. Avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing souvlaki plate - rice was lovely, potatoes were hot and fresh and everything was very generous portions. A small dinner will easily feed two hungry adults !!!  Staff is really friendly and the atmosphere is quant."}
{"text":"i'm giving 4 starts only because i'm sure how everything else tastes on the menu. HUGE HUGE portions, and we eat a lot. We both had the chicken souvlaki dinner, super flavourful and tasty. I had  glass of the house red, not bad. Actually i will give 5 stars, they have the best customer service ever. After finishing our soup as a starter we were asked if we could move over to another table. They felt pretty bad about because they brough a free beer and a free glass of wine that i was drinking. Also they replaced the app we were about to eat because it was hot enough anymore as they said it (not us). after this we were pretty happy, never has that happened to me before. Great job guys! I love peters, have been coming here once in a while for years."}
{"text":"Some great home cooked dishes here! The corned beef sandwich has so much meat on it!! Amazing! And the small souvlaki is enough for two. Always a great choice! Recommend!"}
{"text":"Been here on several occasions and will return again! 
Always great customer service and has the homey feel
I had had the grilled calamari - its is exceptional and fresh 
I also tried the souvlaki -can't go wrong with it! 
The portion sizes are on the larger size so don't forget your stretchy pants and you REALLY  have to be hungry to have an appetizer and a main meal."}
{"text":"I've been living in Mississauga since I was 6 years old and I can't believe that I've been missing out this entire time! I always drive by Peter's On Eglinton, and the place looks pretty big on the outside. Although the restaurant was on the smaller side, it was cozy with tons of windows. My toddler kept on pointing at the pretty light fixtures and the huge stained glass light that was the centerpiece of the restaurant.

We were a group of 4 adults and in anticipation of their large portion sizes, we ordered 2 small pork souvlaki plates and 1 large smoked meat sandwich to share. The basket of fresh crunchy-on-the-outside and soft-on-the-inside buns arrived after we placed our order. The food came quickly and the portions were out of this world! A small pork soulaki plate came with THREE rows of pork, large heaping of rice (kind of on the mushy side), garden salad and an entire potato. The tzatziki sauce was nice and thick and complemented the pork really well. The pork was well-cooked and was not dry at all. Next came the smoked meat sandwich, which was served with vinegar coleslaw (I prefer creamy coleslaw myself) and crunchy thick-cut fries. The sandwich should've came with more rye bread as I found myself eating the 10oz meat on its own for the most part. I put a bit of hot mustard on the already smoky meat and it was heaven! Needless to say, there were still lots of food to take home even though we shared 3 plates. I can't wait to go back and try the other items on their menu - Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is a classic. Such a great family run establishment. Food portions are ridiculously enormous. Staff are super friendly and the atmosphere is cozy. It feels like going over to dinner at your favorite aunts house- expect the waitresses/waiters to have a laugh with you. A little pricey for the type of food but I enjoy giving them business because I know its a great family run place. Food= 4/5 Service= 4.5/5 Atmosphere= 4.5/5"}
{"text":"I have been to the restaurant twice - me a girl from the east end of Toronto. 
The trip is certainly worth the drive and I envy the Mississaugians that have close proximity to this most wonderful restaurant.
I love a good pastrami sandwich. One that is near to the heavens, and Peter's does not disappoint. 
The regular pastrami on rye is  filled with at least 6 inches of pastrami. I need to mention that the pastrami must be made by angels, it is that good.
My companion eaters were equally impressed with their meals; liver and onions, all day breakfast and club sandwich. Other entrees being served to close by diners, looked pretty impressive.
The prices are delightful. The portions are surprisingly ample. The service, efficient, knowledgeable and pleasant,
This place is a treasure."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place with a LOT of food, try this place! Super cute restaurant with decent food and man, portions are huge. Little more on the pricier side but you get a lot for what you pay for. 

I've been here a couple times before and I always get the French onion soup cause that's my fav and the Alfredo pasta. This time I tried the back bacon kaiser with fries and coleslaw as the sides. 

French onion soup still bomb as usual, a tad. Just a tad salty to my liking but that's ok. I've never had back bacon before but I just wanted to try it so I got that. Was not bad! Cuts were thick and it got overwhelming after a few bites cause of the salt. It looked like a burger tbh LOL. I'm not a huge fan of the fries here or the coleslaw (I like my fries crispier if they were a thick cut). 

My bf got 1 piece fish and chips but replaced fries with rice. The rice isn't plain, it has mushrooms on it - stir fried almost and he liked that as a side. The fish was good! His plate came with a soup and the soup of the fish for today was chicken noodle. Looked alright. 

Service was great, super attentive."}
{"text":"Sort of a generic restaurant that serves pastas, sandwiches etc but the portions are ridiculous.  It's almost a guarantee that you will have to take some of the food home with you.  The chicken souvlaki platter is the must try dish here, and I would strongly recommend the small platter which is enough food for 2.  Not only are the potatoes and salad generous in serving, but you get a whole lot of chicken too."}
{"text":"Went here last night for a double date night. Was the last people seated before the place closed. This place has the hugest portions of pork and chicken souvlakis dinners ever!! Not only is it huge, it's pretty damn good. The price is the price of 2 normal souvlaki dinners anywhere else but the portion is as well. The waitress was very sweet and the restaurant is unique and different decorated. I would definitely come back here and tell others about it."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow. Good was pretty good. My parents wanted to go here and I always love a good smoked meat sandwich, and I knew it was on the menu. The food wasn't bad at all, and it was large portions, but I think the dated decor and extra loud setting, combined with the slow service just made the whole experience less than idea. Don't want to trash the place but also won't sing it's praises really. It is definitely an older crowd - which is why i was surprised about the noise. I wish I had more to day but honestly didn't hate it or love it enough to say much more. Just kinda meh."}
{"text":"Haven't had a dinner that makes me WOW a lot, it's truly amazing! Especially it's a foreign food for me. 5 star for this place's decoration, 5 star for the service, 6 star for the food! Will recommend this place for sure. (Portion it's huge so careful!) =)"}
