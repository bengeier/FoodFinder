{"text":"Good service, really good food. Just had the butter chicken so far but can't wait to go back and eat every thing on the menu. Their stuffed rotis looked amazing.  Will be back for more soon!"}
{"text":"The best. Just order it. Butter chicken is an easy out but scores a 10/10. Order something new and get it spicy! So good. Friendly staff too"}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly and accommodating. A very friendly feel and they stay open until 10pm sharp. A great place with great food"}
{"text":"Ordered butter chicken roti and chicken tikka masala roti - did not disappoint! Will re-order again."}
{"text":"Excellent for take out. Amazing. I haven't had Indian food this fantastic a long time :)  Highly recommend it. The service is good, and staff friendly and helpful with the menu."}
{"text":"Very poor experience. We sat by the window, there were numerous dead flies on the window sill. It generally was not clean. The chicken tickka masala roti did not taste good. The banana lassi tasted like it was made from raw bananas.  Servers need to learn that drink glasses should not be served by holding the glass at the brim.  The only good thing was that the staff was polite and friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing Tikka Masala roti. They don't actually do mild, so be prepared for the heat. You won't be hungry after."}
{"text":"Had the chicken Jalfrezi and Boneless Lamb roti... Simply awesome... MUST TRY if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"ordered around a few roti's and delivery took 1.5 hrs. pizza does not even take that long. the food was ok but anything is good when you are hungry. DO NOT order delivery unless you want to wait over 1 hour for your food."}
{"text":"A Liberty Village hidden gem, located just steps away from Metro. Maurya is simply good food at a good price. The service is not always the quickest, but the servers are pleasant and the curries are always delicious. My typical go-to is saag paneer, which is both creamy, subtlety flavoured with spice, and in a singe word - delicious. I've tried several of the vegetarian curry offerings, which seemed very lackluster compared to the saag (at least when wrapped in a roti). Portions for roti are large, so be sure to either bring your second stomach, or be prepared to take away some seconds."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. One of the few places on Lakeshore that has a lot of vegetarian options. SOOO good!"}
{"text":"Favorite roti restaurant. Large servings. Excellent !!!! Butter chicken is my favorite. Would highly recommend !!!!"}
{"text":"What a dream come true! Maurya is affiliated to Mother India, which is affiliated to Gandhi. The roti's at Maurya are exactly the same as Gandhi's, which are incredible. Maurya took over the crappy old Grillicious spot on Lakeshore in Mimico and they did a great job with the interior. It's super clean and smells delicious. The staff is friendly and polite. The butter chicken roti is to die for, their samosas are also excellent."}
{"text":"After two weeks of staring at mouthwatering pictures of butter chicken roti, me and my friend decided to visit. We wanted to go to mother india, but this location was closer and we discovered that they were the same owners. It's not the fanciest place ever, so if you're expecting a nice fancy date, nah b. It is however very comfy with an at-home feel for me. We ordered two mango lassis and one butter chicken roti (mild). There were two other customers who came after us and they got their orders first, which left me sort of sad. The mango lassis were sour, because of the yogurt, but I gulped mine down and my friend didn't like it. The roti however, me oh my, it was wonderful in my mouth. It was literally heaven, I'm telling you. We both shared halves and were completely full after it. We went to a concert afterwards and it kept us going all night long. Being Indian, and not being able to take spice sucks, but the mild was very mild for me. I will consider getting a medium next time. The servers were kind of creepy, but other than that I really enjoyed my visit. My friend even talked about movies with the servers, which gave me another outlook on them, so I have to say they were very kind. In conclusion, I will be back for more heaven in my mouth."}
{"text":"Great service, great price, great staff. Best East Indian food in South Etobicoke.  I've never had a bad meal from this place, it has always been stellar and is just like their other locations (Gandhi and Mother India). The food is tasty, fresh, spicy and the portions are very generous.  Lots of vegetarian choices.   The seating area is not the coziest, but most people seem to get takeout and enjoy the Roti at home. Staff are friendly and the service is quick. The price is right."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Food is great! Although I went for a quick takeout order, the staff was extremely friendly I had to write a review! Will most certainly visit again!"}
{"text":"After driving in from Ottawa, I was dying for some good eats, and great Roti options in back home are few and far between.   Ordered the Chicken Korma roti to go. Arrived quickly, and in a takeout container that would have easily served two people. The roti shell itself was delicious, and the chicken korma (spiced medium) was fabulous. Honestly no clue how one could eat this thing with their hands. Would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"They would not redeem the 10% coupon offered by yelp unfortunately. Brought down our first (last?) Time experience?"}
{"text":"What every Indian restaurant should be.  Great food, well priced, quick service, and food from both north and south India. We ordered chicken biryani, tikka and curry with 2 samosas, all great and portion sizes were generous."}
{"text":"Best Indian resto on this side of town. Same owners as Ghandi downtown... Just as good too! Love their spinach & lamb roti & butter chicken, medium hot... Always super fresh, made from scratch and very delicious! Also have a great chai masala."}
{"text":"I live in Mimico and have driven by Maurya every day since it opened and didn't think too much about it until I heard they were affiliated to Gandhi (which I frequent often for takeout on my way home from work).  I decided to try it out and WOW!  the quality and freshness of the food is top notch.  I called in and ordered the butter chicken (medium - which had a kick so if you don't like any heat get mild) and a samosa with raita, everything was perfect and tasted exactly like Gandhi's rotis!! i'm so excited it's down the street from my home - I can get fresh Roti anytime.  I'm really looking forward to trying other Rotis from Maurya, i'm sure they will all taste as good as the butter chicken.  Unfortunately that location hasn't had a lot of success with restaurants, so I hope Maurya lasts as it's a great addition to the area.  Enjoy! Also, the portions are huge...really good for sharing or taking leftovers for lunch."}
{"text":"Awesome roti, everything we have tried is amazing. My husband loves the lamb jalfrizi and I can't stop ordering the butter chicken. They spice it to your taste. They have a \"special\" that's been around for a year probably - madras - highly recommend that too. So fast, when they tell you 20 minutes, aim for 10."}
{"text":"I've had food from here on a few separate occasions and it was very good 3 out of 4 times with minor issues, which keep it from getting a 5-star review.   The place has little going on in terms of decor and ambiance and is better for take away.  The first time I had it we tried a bunch of the different vegetarian rotis - they were all really good and all have distinct flavours, so you can't really go wrong with what you pick.  Another time, we placed an order for pick-up over the phone for 5 veggie biryani for a party. When we got there they said they didn't receive our order and asked to see our phone to check if we called the right place. We showed them that we did, in fact, call them. Then they went to check in the back and came back to say, \"We got your order but only for one biryani.\" So either they took the order down wrong or never got it in the first place and were offering us whatever they had on hand. We ended up waiting for twenty minutes for them to make the biryani. If you're on a tight schedule I wouldn't recommend this place because it seems pretty unreliable and not the best at fixing issues with orders on the fly.   It was really good biryani but at that price and the time this wasted most restaurants would offer a discount or something for the inconvenience caused by their mistake rather than trying to convince customers that they never called the restaurant and asking them for proof of the call.   Other than that, the most recent time I got take-out from here I didn't really enjoy it even though I got the same kind of roti that I had loved the other two times (saag paneer), maybe it was a fluke. Their veggie biryani was a lot better than their lamb biryani in my opinion.   Despite all this, this is still a four-star place, which just goes to show how good the food really was those 3 out of 4 times."}
{"text":"Our takeout (samosa, veggie roti and lamb curry roti) was decent but not great.  Portions were very good though and the counter service was efficient.  Parking was a big plus."}
{"text":"Mind you I haven't eaten here in a bit, but the food is nothing special, 2 pieces of meat and a couple potatoes in a roti. My main problem with this restaurant is that it smells so strongly - don't plan to go anywhere after because you WILL stink."}
{"text":"I'm thrilled! Seriously, their Chicken Tikka Masala Roti is to die for.  A lot of flavor, top quality, and they don't cut corners in the quality of their food to save some bucks. The prices are in pair with some other local Indian restaurants but the quality is so much better. Friendly service gives this the additional star."}
{"text":"This is the best roti place in Toronto! We've been here numerous times and the quality is always spot on. Employees are very nice and are great whether you eat in or take out.   Our favorites are the butter chicken roti and chicken korma roti. The spiciness is fair not overly spicy for the level."}
{"text":"First time there. Found them thru yelp. Called in my order and it was ready within twenty mins.  Friendly and prompt service.  Dining area simple and clean. Food was great. Mild chicken roti for my boys 4 and 6 yrs. Medium spicy for me and wifey.  Tasty samosas too. Fair prices. Will return again."}
{"text":"So far I've tried many dishes on the menu, including the chana, the saag paneer, the veggie korma and the butter chicken. I've really liked every single one and I haven't found any of them watery or flavourless. On the contrary, the medium spicy has a nice kick and great flavour. The butter chicken had a very decent amount of meat in it, unlike the other reviews. The portions are also generous.  Roti is one of my favourite so I'm extremely happy to have a location within walking distance!"}
{"text":"This place I think is owned by the same guy who owns Gandhi Roti on queen street. I am sucker for good Indian food. Can't say this place is authentic but it offers really good roti. My personal favourite is butter chicken roti. Biryani is also pretty decent.   There are few short comings though - there is no consistency for the different level of hot offered. Sometime medium is hot and other times hot is not hot enough.   Another issue I have is that they put in potatoes along with meat and I hate that. I specially ask them for no potatoes each time. May be it is to save cost of something but they need to check with customers whether they want potatoes or not."}
{"text":"I went here a few days ago looking for some delicious Chana and was not disappointed. How had I never heard of this place before?  I had the Chana Roti with samosas and they did not disappoint. The gentleman at the counter asked how spicy I wanted it and warned me that medium is actually quite spicy, so I opted for mild instead.   I arrived around the dinner hour but the service was still prompt and friendly. I found the portions to be fairly large so you definitely are getting your money's worth! Overall, I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants to satisfy their cravings for delicious Indian food. The food is delicious and the service is friendly. I will be back to try some of their other menu options."}
{"text":"I've given this place many chances, and it seems to just get worse each time. Stale, cold, dry pakoras. Freezer burnt peas pulao. The rotis (wraps) are bland and greasy. The food is inedible. Just don't. This place needs to go out of business or improve their quality."}
{"text":"The roti was OK, the  plastic button that was for some reason in my roti, that I crunched down on, wasn't great."}
{"text":"Best East Indian cuisine on king west !! Extremely friendly service, and the food never disappoints!!!"}
{"text":"Just tried for the first time. We split a saag paneer roti, rasmalai, and mango lassi. The roti was huge, saag was creamy, paneer was delicious and soft, not rubbery. Roti was delicious and not oily. Mango lassi was tangy, cold and refreshing. A small meal for two or a HUGE meal for one for $18.00."}
{"text":"When you use the coupons off yelp. They put less meat.  And they're not happen when you mention the promo off yelp. This place is not that great like that"}
{"text":"The mixed vegetable roti is amazing,I'm not a big fan of indian food,but this restsurant is truly amazing. The food is soo good and yet inexpensive. The briani is at this place is extremely good as well. This is definitely one of the best restaurants i have tried in Canada!!!"}
{"text":"Well, long story short I ordered food from Mauraya lots of time and today they made a mistake as I ordered chicken curry plate and they gave me Roti wrap I called them they told me that I made mistake and we can give you 10% off in your next order without any apology. When I took the food back to change they behaved super rude and unprofessional. This place need new people at their cash or tune the existing girls as their behaviours are not professional at all"}
{"text":"A great bang for your buck place.  I had the lamb saag the first time, and it was fantastic.  In a subsequent visit, I asked what they recommended, and they said butter chicken.  It was ok, I'm guessing it's their most popular dish just because... Sticking with lamb dishes from now on.  :)"}
{"text":"This place is as unassuming as it gets. Their lassis are excellent. The mango was delicious and the plain was perfect. We mixed them together and had a wonder harmony of flavour. We ordered the lamb biriyani and it was delicious. It had perfectly cooked pieces of lamb (quite substantial). We also ordered the muttar paneer - very tasty. I had the heat between medium and mild and it was quite spicy - so if you like spice go for it. We also bought their garlic mango chutney sauce - I will be putting that on all sorts of things. It was very tasty. I am so thrilled we finally stumbled on this place. I know we will be getting takeout from them when we want Indian."}
{"text":"What a gem!!  So easy to miss but so worth going!  Butter chicken roti was awesome!  Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Excellent butter chicken Roti.  Get a side of mango chutney to cut the heat...along with a pitcher of water.  So good.   Butter chicken Roti image: http://www.flickr.com/photos/soulconcept/8571113833/lightbox/"}
{"text":"My favourite place for Indian roti and biryani. Always fresh, takes a little time because they actually care about what they bring to your table. Everything is absolutely delicious. And the best part is their food is not very oily like just about every other Indian restaurant out there. My husband and I often get the eggplant or lamb roti. The saag paneer roti and mixed veggie is just as delish though. Love this place. Will keep coming back as long as they dish out the great food. Don't change anything!  In terms of locale, right on Lake Shore. Small parking space shared in a small strip plaza. Not too much seating. People usually order out at this place."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! The \"manager\" will yell at you. I just asked to have my order corrected. But he said, I am wrong and it was only half wrong...did not apologize at all. After spending a decent amount of money, that just does not sit right with me. Also place is dirty, it's too bad because otherwise the food actually tastes good."}
{"text":"A very good Indian food in LV.   I personally think this is very well cooked if I base the experience with the 10 yr \"training\" had in what is considered the best country for East Indian Food outside India: UK.   Here, the level of spiciness is based of what Eastern Indian perceive as spicy, so just to let you know, if you are used to a medium spicy based on the North American scale, here you might want to ask for mild.   I had a lamb roti. The portion was good with a nice kick. Spices were well cooked and the quantity of meat in my roti was sufficient.   My friends had all the same order as I had and it was consistent all the way through I gotta say. The only exception was the order of the butter chicken which was really tasty but, unfortunately, like one of the previous review stated, didn't have much meat as you would expected. Still, I personally feel that it was a really, really good.  The service was prompt and cordial and the place has a very nice welcoming atmosphere.  Prices are just a couple of bucks more than any other place but in all honesty, for the place, the service and the quality of the food, I don't mind the little higher price.   I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Good roti spot! Flavourful curries and generous portions. If you like it spicy, try the medium or medium-hot. If you like to burn your stomach, get the hot (but don't say you weren't warned).   I order from here frequently and usually get the same things. I like it, but it's different every time. I wish Maurya would be more consistent with how much curry they stuff inside the roti. Sometimes it's nice a saucy, sometimes it's drier. Overall, I'm glad it's in the neighbourhood. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Always disappointed by the following: * Samosa never freshly cooked * Butter chicken = 80% sauce,10% meat,10% potato.  There is more chicken on a 1/4 chicken breast from Metro than in this butter chicken dish.  This is the first place I've eaten at that adds potato to butter chicken on rice...the pieces of potato are cut to the same size as the small pieces of chicken...deceptive with their advertising suggesting reasonable amount of chicken for a single serving meal.   Why bother opening if no desire to do it right."}
{"text":"We had Malai Kofta Roti. It was good, could have been better... The roti was a little dry and Malai Kofta was lacking gravy. I will not be trying this again for a while. The Indian Roti at Queen's Quay is still my benchmark..."}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday for lunch. Nice portion size for the price! I had to wait a while for my Korma Roti, id probably phone ahead if I was ordering again."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying this restaurant. Went with a couple of recommendations. Found the food both tasteful and appetizing. We chose take out and were very pleased. Will return."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!!!!!!! The Butter Chicken Roti is the best I've ever had. My husband really enjoys the Goat and regular chicken Roti. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"I decided to give them a try after driving by numerous times so I ordered their boneless chicken roti and was a little disappointed. First of all, I'm accustomed to yellow curry chicken. When I bit into it, it was red and tasted like it was tomato based. Totally not what I was expecting. Nowhere in the description did it mention anything about tomato. For anything curry, I'll stick to my regular spots down the street around Islington/Lakeshore - plus they got some of the best oxtail I've ever tasted!"}
{"text":"I got take out from here a couple of weeks ago when they first opened. I got the Saag Paneer on rice and my boyfriend got the butter chicken on rice and an order of samosas. The food was ready in just under 20 minutes and was about $30 (I think). We ordered \"medium\"spicy which is what I usually get from most Indian places, but this was really spicy (for me anyways)! If/when I order agin I think I will order the mild because it was a little too much for me, that being said the flavours were really good, we both liked our food and the portions were gigantic."}
{"text":"Great little discovery near by!! Sundays are typically my pizza day but felt like mixing it up today.   If you want delivery, your order needs to be placed with UberEats but take out was ready in less than 20 minutes.   We ordered the butter chicken on rice and the chicken curry rotti. People aren't joking! This is a massive amount of food!!!  Both were really tasted. Both meals were ordered with a medium spice level. The rotti was mild but that butter chicken - mmmmmmmm!!! But, I don't think I could progress to that next level of spice! Haha  Small number of tables inside - definitely more ideal for take out!"}
{"text":"I love the butter chicken roti. Always takes 20 mins to make, so order ahead.  I do not care for the microwaved samosa, however. Go down the street to Kothur if you want hot samosa."}
{"text":"Excellent Roti that ranks right up there with Island food Roti in downtown Toronto. Huge portions and excellent flavour so I have nothing to complain about. Wait times are a bit long but worth it in the end. The Rotis are more flat and rectangular in shape. Pretty saucy inside too. Go for their special Butter Chicken Roti."}
{"text":"This is one of the best eats in the hood. We continue get the Shahi Paneer wrap when dinner isn't planned out. But as vegetarians and paying premium for Paneer... Why do you substitute POTATOES for PANEER??? It's like putting in chicken instead of lamb. I pay for paneer. I expect paneer. Not filler..."}
{"text":"Terrible food with even worse service. I live right across the street from here and was excited to try it out but was extremely disappointed.  The waitress did not take our orders down properly and asked twice - then gave us the wrong dish in the end. And proceeds to give us attitude by saying \"that's why I asked you twice\". It was a table of two, we ordered two of the SAME lamb dishes, so I'm not sure how any normal server could mess this up.  Then she goes back to the cash and starts whispering and laughing with the other waitress and never checked up on us until we asked for the bill.  Quality of food: also bad. We shared a samosa as an appetizer - and it was soggy like it was microwaved. Our main dishes seemed watered down with the curry sauce (bonus, I asked for Indian spicy and my meal was barely tangy).  Will not be returning here again and would not recommend to anyone. There's another middle eastern restaurant, Paramount, across the street with much better service and food."}
{"text":"My order: butter chicken with rice ($13.95+tax)  The experience: unimpressed. I ordered via Ritual, which said \"usually ready in 15 minutes\". They said it would take longer and selected 20. I arrived 5 minutes after their estimate and was still waiting 10 minutes for my order. Dozens of people came and went with their pick-up orders in the time I was waiting.  The portion: decent but not \"huge\" like some others said. It was enough food for me to have for dinner. I wasn't floored by the portion, especially for $16 after taxes. I was able to finish it without much issue. Like most places, they over-do it on the rice while skimping on the amount of chicken.  The taste: quite good. Nice sauce that had the right blend of herbs and spices. I won't fault them for the food itself, even if I wish it had more chicken. There was plenty of sauce so none of it felt dry. I chose \"mild/medium\" spice and even that was a bit too spicy for me, but I figure if I picked \"mild\", it would have had no spice factor.  Would I go back? Maybe. I might try some of their other items, but only if they understand proper timing for pick-up orders. If you say 20 minutes and it takes 35? That's unacceptable. If you need 30 or 35, say that.  Also, the price is a bit much for what you get, so this will be a rare treat. Also since it's new (and in Liberty Village), I bet this time next year, it'll be 25% more expensive."}
{"text":"Well this was our go to place. Food is great...except for our last visit. We ordered pick up. We came, waited, waited, waited, and then another customer came back and returned his food (which was our order) as he had wrong order and then they wanted to give us that food which was gone for at least 10 min (can you believe it) as we waited and never saw this individual in the restaurant.  She argued with us telling us it is fresh....how would you know that your rotti order is wrong unless you tried it.  We finally got our money back after a few back and forths.  CANT believe that just happened."}
{"text":"Very good food and price and staff. Have been ordering from here for some time and never a complaint. The butter chicken is to die for."}
{"text":"We went for lunch to this place. Personnel were friendly. We ordered Biryani chicken and butter chicken with rice. Food quality and price is reasonable. It took more than I expected to get food, considering that we were only customers. Overall experience was good and I will go there again time to time.  Note: If you are not hot food type of person order mild spicy."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Unless your idea of great Indian food is a tomato paste stew called a curry and a \"'biriyani\" of overcooked rice, lots of chilli powder and a few mutton chunks!"}
{"text":"Alongside GANDHI ROTI,  as good as a it gets.  Great West end/mimico spot.   Friendly staff, well run restaurant.  Butter chicken roti; exceptional!"}
{"text":"One of the best Roti's in the city. I'd give them full stars except they have a ridiculous wait time. Make sure you call ahead."}
{"text":"My husband and I have ordered food here many times due to proximity and location. It is not very good at all. All the veggie subjis are disgusting. I have ahloo gobi. I'm Indian myself and love cooking so I know a good Indian joint and this ain't it. The butter chicken leaves you with GERD or other issues. It is also pricey. Try somewhere else but not here for good India food!"}
{"text":"Pros: Food Taste  Staff are usually nice  Fast   Cons: Seating  Heating for staff was broken  Cost Customer service is mixed   Summary:  Good, not bad food for takeout/pickup. Chicken korma and butter chicken are great"}
{"text":"The roti here are an addiction which I indulge in at least once a week.  Unfortunately this is spoiled by the extremely poor table service which has gotten worse lately.   Several times I have sat for almost a half hour before anyone shows up at the table with a menu.  Once they do the meal comes quickly but then no one comes to the table to clear it or to ask if you want dessert or anything else.   Even though I have been a regular customer since they opened I often feel like I am wasting their time by wanting to eat in.  The good staff they had have all left."}
{"text":"Had the chicken roti.  I'm more used to Caribbean roti and liked that better than this.    Nice staff though.  Very polite."}
{"text":"definitely my go to spot for take out in liberty.   butter chicken roti is my favourite, it's enormous but it's so delicious you'll probably eat the entire dish like i do every time even past the point of full.  the service isn't great but just order take out and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"I have passed this restaurant many times but didn't pay much attention as many restaurants on the Lakeshore leave a lot to be desired.  But then I read that Maurya's is operated by Mother India and decided to give it a try because I've been enjoying Mother India's rotis for many years.  I ordered the Chicken Jalfrizi roti and was pleasantly surprised it was just as delicious as Mother India in Parkdale... And the service was incredibly fast and friendly.  I encourage everyone to give this place a try if you like East Indian food.  Support your local restaurants!"}
{"text":"Maurya is owned by the same owner as Mother India, but somehow I feel the food in Mother India better, especially the curries (which is most of the menu).  The Liberty Village location was long time in coming (as the store stood closed with the Maurya sign on for about 7-8 months).  The location is small, but clean.  The service is attentive, although a bit spotty during lunch hour.  The curries (in a Roti or on Rice) is what Mother India is famous for, and this location is quite good.  I saw some reviews mentioning 'little meat' inside, but that's not my experience.  After all, I am not looking for a pile of meat glazed in curry, but a bowl of curry with meat inside, which is what you get here.  In any case, this is the best Indian food in Liberty Village (the only one for now :)"}
{"text":"Really good roti! But also really spicy, I got a mild veggie korma and would call that a medium, but it was really good. Also the mango lassi was tasty! Everything is bit over priced but I guess that's also common in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing roti! Butter chicken roti is to die for! Portions very generous their tikka chicken is also amazing"}
{"text":"Went last night with my girlfriend and we were not pleased at all. We ordered pakora and Aloo Chaat to start. The chaat was fine but the pakoras were clearly not fresh and were ridiculously salty. They were rubbery and tasted like they had just been microwaved.  The curry main courses that we had were Chicken Madras and Lamb Jalfrizi, both on a bed of rice. We also bought a garlic roti to go with it. The Madras was fine with some flavor but the Jalfrizi was absolutely terrible. No flavor at all, it was watery and the vegetables were not fresh. It was quite honestly one of the worst curries I've ever had. The roti, on the other hand, was good and, seeing as the portions were so enormous, we could easily share one curry and have food to spare.  After we'd finished our one curry, we were not asked how our meal was, the staff clearly seeing that I had barely touched my curry and we were also charged for it. Only after we'd paid did they ask, unbelievably, whether I'd like to take it home with me.  Considering that there are plenty of fantastic Indian restaurants close to Liberty Village, why anyone would want to go here is beyond me. The food was awful and the service was even worse."}
{"text":"We shamelessly order from this local Mimico joint at least once a week as the food is so freakin' amazing!   The owner, Lokesh, is so nice and accommodating.  You could taste the quality and freshness of the ingredients. They use chicken breast in all their curries and they don't overpower it with lots of potatoes (like other places).  If you like hot and spicy and ask for it, believe me, they will deliver the goods!  The portion sizes are huge; enough for two people.    We've tried the both the chicken and shrimp biryani, (regular) chicken curry, vindaloo, tikka and, my ultimate favourite, korma - so rich and delicious and such a guilty pleasure!  Not to mention the rotis ... I never even liked roti until now!  I've also had Lokesh cater two of my office lunches and everything was seamless.  The first time was for a group of five so we ordered five dishes for an office lunch. Service was excellent; the driver arrived on time; food was piping hot.  All my four colleagues LOVED their lunches.  One ordered the curry lamb roti and she said the lamb was very tender.  Two others said the butter chicken is right up there with some of the best they ever had.  The two that live out here in the west end went with their husbands the following weekend because they loved the food so much.  The second order was for a group of 21.  I simply emailed Lokesh, he arranged to have each staff's name on their respective dishes so distribution was easy.  Everything arrived on time, still hot and fresh and not one person complained.  Staff that weren't part of the meeting were drooling because the food smelled so good.  Total for 21 people was just over $200!  This establishment really needs to be featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives!"}
{"text":"Just had their Shrimp Vindaloo Roti (mild) and it was yummy! The portion size was good for $15 which is a bit pricey but the taste was totally worth it. The only time I have had such good roti before is at Gandhi's, and this comes pretty close to it. The flavour was authentic and even though it's not a great sit down place, it's perfect for take out. Order can be placed over the phone and can be picked up in 15-20 min.. or over Uber etc. Definitely recommend this place! Also have tons of veggie and vegan choices, as well as chicken and lamb for the meat lovers!"}
{"text":"Love their butter chicken roti and lamb biryani. Slowly trying to try many things on the menu but I can say the pakoras were the only thing I didn't like so far. They were overdone and seemed like they had been reheated several times. The samosas are delicious though if you want an app."}
{"text":"Venue - Nothing special, but the most unassuming places often have the best food ;)   Service - The food doesn't come out super quick, but that's probably because it's prepared fresh. They are always friendly and accommodating. Love that you get your own pitcher of water! lol   Food - So good! The portions (as stated) are fairly large. I've had the potato roti and lamb. Both were really good. However, as mentioned previously, I did find that the spice level is sometimes inconsistent depending on the chef. One time the medium was hotter than I expected (but perfect amount of spice), and another time the medium could have been slightly more spicy.    Price - about $8-$12 per roti.   *Heard they were going to open a location in Liberty Village :D"}
{"text":"First time takeaway from here,  good menu but quite limited. Flavour for roti was very nice... didn't taste like ingredients were dropped in the pan and flashed quick like alot of places. Be wary though, medium spice is still pretty hot by North American standards. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Ok, while not the best in the city, this place is good.  It is comfort food 101.  The garlic Roti is to die for.  They have a dining room, but seem to be more set on food delivery.  The service/ food prep is slow but the food is worth the wait so call ahead of time to place an order."}
{"text":"We were just driving by thought we would stop and try this place No mistake it was very good. I tried the chicken vindaloo it was the best I every had, the price was good to. I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Glad to find a yummy Indian place nearby. The food is flavourful and they serve huge portions."}
{"text":"Very watery curry's with hardly any spice and flavour, another review mentioned this as well. There are much better options up on Ossington. Not the best atmosphere in the restaurant either  The smell coming from the restaurant is also very unpleasant."}
{"text":"They have an offer for Yelp check-ins, yay!  Food portions are generous, and you will be full after a single dish! Medium spicy was quite spicy, but thankfully they gave us a whole pitcher of cold tap water. The mild butter chicken roti we got was also quite good.  No WiFi (WiFi for security cameras only). BMO guest network nearby is accessible from the seating area."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem for shizzle!  I know this is gonna sound horrible, but I can't remember WHAT roti I got exactly.  It was Lamb (not Jalfrizi) something or other, but a recommendation by the young chap behind the counter.  I told him that I liked spicy food, he gave me his suggestion, I rolled with it!    (I've had Butter Chicken @ Gandhi's before, so I wanted to to try something different for my first visit.)  N.B.:  Roti was not like the kind that you get at West India places.  As per the other photos, roti shell is white and not flaky/greasy.  Service was sweet 'n kind.  I saw the kid walk across the street to make a delivery, by foot, for Vishnu's Sake!!!  Another lady came to my table and was sorta bashful when she asked how everything was.  Pre-dinner/late afternoon service was fairly empty.  Place was clean!  Parking lot adjacent to restaurant, so that is ALWAYS a bonus for burbanites!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious.   Smells amazing.  Prepared fresh and piping hot  Nice atmosphere. Big patio  Only downer is the \"meat\" portions are small as compared to other roti places I been"}
{"text":"So this is actually my second time I've eaten from here. First time was a walk in food was great a bit too spicy for my liking i had gotten the shrimp/potato curry roti, as well as a few samosas(which were extremely cold inside). The restaurant is an adequate size, but fairly empty. I think most people order takeout or opt for delivery vis skip the dishes or uber eats.  This time I actually ordered through skip the dishes and got the butter chicken roti with two samosas. The samosas are average I've had much better. The butter chicken roti on the other had was sooo delicious. Great  portion of meat along with potato ratio. the sauce was full of flavor and nice and creamy. It was nice and warm packaged in a foil container which kept the freshness and heat. I opted for mild as i am a wuss when it comes to heat lol.  I did find it a bit pricey, I'm used to buying samosas for 3/1$ from my local spot in Brampton. So paying 1.50 each here when they tasted quite bland was a bit much. The roti was about 13$ plus tax which again is quite pricey but I guess prices are higher because of the area. Although it was worth it because I enjoyed every bite and had left overs for lunch the following day. Must warm up in over. Microwave leaves it all soggy :)  Definitely will consider returning."}
{"text":"This place is crazy addicting. During the summer time, there were weeks were I got it 3-4 out of the 7 day period. Butter chicken is awesome, so is the chicken korma roti.  Get it with rice, and it's just as good! Very rarely the sauce can be bland (which just happened two days ago) but I guess it depends who prepared the sauce at that point, maybe just a bit of neglect, but this only happened to me 3 times, and I must have ate there over 150 times. The staff is very friendly, especially the owner (I assume the one with the moustache and always rocking nice shirt and pants).    I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have walked by this place several times, and we finally ordered some food for take out.   We ordered:  Chicken korma with rice - delicious curry with juicy chunks of chicken on a bed of rice. It comes with a good portion of chicken, unlike the other patrons experience. Overall I would order this dish again.  Lamb biryani - it's really really good with a nice kick of heat even though we ordered, \"mild.\" It's infused with spices like cardamom, and the chunks of lamb is moist and not dry. It's much better than most Indian restaurants in little India.  Saag paneer roti - not my favourite, but my husband really enjoyed it. I find it a bit too salty for my liking and/or missing some spices.   Overall, we love this place and will definitely come back if we're craving Indian food. It's a way better tasting food than what we have had so far from little India."}
{"text":"Took forever to get my food (dining in), and I was hungry! Other than that nice, friendly staff and I thought the lamb curry and rice dish was great!"}
{"text":"Food is ok,  but consistently unreliable for getting order right and when they mess up they just don't see to care.  Will no longer order from them. A pity!"}
{"text":"I've tried their butter chicken roti and lamb roti on separate nights and both were fantastic! The portions are very generous and could easily be two meals of you make yourself a side salad (need some greens!) I ordered my meal off of Ritual and decided I wanted to sit outside on the patio to eat and they were super accommodating and provided me with a glass of water and utensils. They didn't have to but they were super pleasant about it and was very happy to."}
{"text":"Best tikka masala roti ever! Spicy, so be careful what you ask for. Extremely filling."}
{"text":"Best stuffed roti! Must try their Lamb Saag Roti! Just delicious!!! Huge portion for a great price.  Highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"We have eaten at Maurya several times. Tried almost all rotis. Our favorites are the saag paneer, malai kofta and chicken. Huge portions, extremely high quality, spice levels can be adjusted per preference. They are not aware of the Yelp 10% off, but gave it to us last time as we're regular customers. Sweet, friendly and diligent staff."}
{"text":"Our original choices for dinner were not available. We ended up ordering Sag Paneer and Vegetable Korma. The flavors were great, the portions favorable and the price was right."}
{"text":"The best roti I've ever had! I ordered the mutter paneer roti (medium) and it was very spicy hot. The roti is so fresh. It's addictive, be warned!"}
{"text":"This place is super clean and affordable! The roti is beyond delicious and honestly im so glad I found a place so close to home to get roti!"}
{"text":"So far sooooo good.   We visited for the first time yesterday, but we will definitely be back. $40 for 3 monster dishes that equalled dinner for 2 for two nights.  We got the butter chicken roti, shrimp roti, and mixed vegetable rice. We could decide which roti was better.   The fellow who took our order was quiet at first, but came out of his shell a bit when after he asked what spice level we wanted, I said medium, then clarified that we wanted \"white people medium,\" to which he replied with a grin, \"Ok, mild. Our medium is white people hot.\"  We ended up getting mild to medium which was perfect for our tastes."}
{"text":"Did you guys get new back kitchen employees? Or did you make executive decisions to cut back on portions in order to cut costs?  Well.. Here are the pictures of a roti and lamb on rice. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"What a fool I've been, ordering my mutter paneer exclusively with rice all of these years. Maurya has shown me the light. Mutter paneer rotis are the new pizza.   Maurya is fast and delicious and offers you all of your Indian favourites in five different spice temperatures, on your choice of in a roti, on rice, or on its own. I often get this goodness delivered, and I've never been disappointed. Their samosas are just a touch greasier and crispier than other places, too, making them another must try from Maurya. I'm all over the place drooling just thinking about my next snack from Lady M!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is good. Sometimes parking can be a headache. But worth the hassle."}
