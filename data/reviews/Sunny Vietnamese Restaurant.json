{"text":"Thanks to a co-worker who brought me here for pho at lunch - I've been a fan ever since! My favorites are their spicy vermicelli dishes - great for those of you who love the spice kick. 

This place is very practical for an informal lunch, especially for those of you with offices close to China town! They do take reservation! If you decide to go last minute - try to get in a bit before lunch. It never takes more than 5-10 minutes for your order to arrive. Don't worry about being late for that 1 o'clock meeting. The portion is a good amount, but not sizable to manage that will send you crawling back to the office in slow-mo. 

What I love the most about Sunny's is that they're always quite organized; our orders have never come wrong at the table, quick & polite service, seating selection and convenient from the downtown core! 

Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"We left 5 minutes after arriving, as Sunny's (lunch?) menu is small, and there was literally NO vegetarian options. No tofu on the menu at all. That is strange."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for years simply because it gets overlooked.  It's located on the second floor with a bakery underneth and unless someone takes you, you'll probably wouldn't notice it.

Saw some familiar faces on the staff so I was extremely happy.  What that means is that there wasn't a turnover and more importantly their sate is still good.  

I immediately ordered a large sate and it was delicious.  The food came out fast and it's no non sense...just the way I like it.  Eat and GTFO.

Completely recommend this place but it gets extremely busy at lunch.  Take a late or an early lunch and order the Pho Sate.  I'm certain you'll feel satisfied afterwards."}
{"text":"I've only tried the medium size sate pho ($9). The portion was on the smaller side, which is a plus for portion control. 

The broth was orange in colour and quite spicy. The noodles were cooked to my preference, more on the firmer side. The beef was thin and not a whole lot of it either. 

Points for steaming the sprouts and basil for us (to avoid e-coli and salmonella). Despite its steam bath, the vegetables were still crisp. The restaurant itself is spacious and non hectic, which isn't typical for a Pho restaurant. Service was friendly and attentive.

I wouldn't say its better than its competitors (Pho Hoai, Pho Pasteur, Song Viet), but is A-OK in my books."}
{"text":"This place may confuse a first time visitor since its on the second floor. The main level venue was dark so as I approached from the street I actually thought Sunny was closed.  Once you figure that out and go up the stairs you walk into a bright, clean cafeteria-like room that only gives away it's true identity from a few Vietnamese pictures and nic nacs sprinkled around the room.

The menu is pretty typical and the service is friendly and prompt. I had no. 6, beef satay soup and it could be one of my favourites. Deep flavour and more heat then most, this is a wonderful noodle soup. Maybe just a touch less fish sauce and I'd give it five stars.

Next time I'm in Chinatown I'll drop in and try another dish. Definitely worth another trip."}
{"text":"I love SUNNY!  I go to Sunny's probably at least 2-3 times a month.  The prices are great and the food is fantastic.  The staff are always welcoming and helpful.  The satay rare beef soup is the absolute best!  Make your way to Sunny's in China Town, you won't be disappointed"}
