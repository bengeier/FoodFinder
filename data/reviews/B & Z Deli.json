{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The service can be a little inconsistent.  Some of the part-time help is not always up to par. Minor gripe. The food is delicious. The price is right too. It is a solid, comfortable, delicious deli! I recommend the Rachel/Reuben. It usually takes a few extra minutes, but it is worth it for certain."}
{"text":"Why go to Panera when you can come here and get a delicious sandwich for $5.25? They use Boar's Head meats and cheeses cut to order and Breadworks bread. The roast beef and swiss, spicy Italian, and chicken salad sandwiches are all popular choices in my house. They also have a decent selection of prepared foods which I've not tried but look good."}
{"text":"I love this deli! Great food and the lunch special you can get is nice. Sandwich and side for about $6.25. And unlike most places with that kind of deal you actually get the whole sandwich not just half! They offer quality Boar's head deli meat and all sides are made fresh. I definitely suggest trying the tortellini pasta side, light italian dressing with tomatoes and black olives. I highly suggest the chicken breast wrap,comes with caesar dressing but I always ask for ranch instead.

During lunch there is wait, but worth it. Staff is friendly, but I have been there a few times were they seemed aggravated when busy."}
{"text":"Homemade soups and deli sandwiches are superb for location. Counter style service and often times a 5+min wait. This is mostly a carry out place but there are also a few tables that will fill up around lunch. If you're running late and don't have dinner planned, they always have a daily feature you can heat up for the family. I think having their homemade soups frozen and available for purchase in genius, too. They don't add a lot of salt to their prepared food, which is an added bonus."}
{"text":"Best subs and sandwiches in town. The spicy Italian is incredibly good. Great soups and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Outstanding service along with great prices make this a must stop deli in the area.  Boars Head meat, great home made soup, meals to go (the eggplant parm is to die for) - Breadworks bread and friendly service.  The egg salad is a must!!"}
{"text":"Family owned deli near Hartwood Acres.  This place serves Boar's Head deli meat and makes the best Rueben in Pittsburgh, hands down.  Great selection of soup, Stuffed Pepper soup is insanely good.  Pittsburgh's best kept secret, although not for long!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful family owned business.  I ordered 25+ wraps and fruit with a dessert to be delivered nearby for a meeting, and the folks at B&Z were great to deal with.  Everything arrived on time and my guests were extremely complimentary about how delicious the food was.  i would highly recommend B&Z for lunch, catering, anything at all."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, and prices that cant be beat!  You cannot go wrong with their catering."}
