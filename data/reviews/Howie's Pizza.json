{"text":"Awesome pizza.  Different types of sauces if you can't do tomatoes.  They even do gluten free.  Awesome, done how it should be."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Ordered up a deep-dish meat lover's pizza and it arrived within 30 minutes. Plenty of Ham, Pepperoni, beef, Bacon crumbs & real italian sausage made for a very tasty meat pizza pie! The crust was thick and non-greasy which I liked."}
{"text":"I really dig Howie's Pizza. Great pizza made by a friendly guy. 
The sauce is really tomato-y, and the dough is so much better than the cardboard you get from papa johns or those other chain places. I always insist on getting Howie's if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Wow. Really great pizza. It's a small place. Take out and delivery only. There are a couple of chairs inside with a table, but definitely not a lunch place. They have premade pizza's that you can purchase and cook at home. We ordered a large 'meat' pizza. We got the regular crust. Howie's does have a thin crust if you fancy it. The crust was good. Much like the pizza houses of the 1970s. Toppings were generous. The price was comparable to Boston Pizza. The pizza was very good. Our family really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Great local pizza place.  Fresh toppings, zesty sauce and generous amount of cheese.   Usually less than 30 minutes.  Howie is  a friendly fellow that supports the community and local schools.   He even offers up a free slice to trick or treaters on Halloween."}
{"text":"Great service, super friendly and easily the best pizza I've had in this City. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"In Calgary, as in Montreal, the pizza joints are run by Greeks, not Italians. Ottawa fares better despite a shortage of  actual paesanos; they are served by the Lebanese - still not as good as real Italian style, but a bit closer.., 

Howie's is typical - heavy, dense crusts, over-sweet oddly-spiced sauce - edible, but far less than excellent. 

And as is typical in Calgary, expensive. Why do take-out joints here think they can charge as much as sit-down service restaurants?"}
