{"text":"Best michiladas ever!!! The restaurant smelled cleaned , the service was quick and pleasant."}
{"text":"I'm still sitting here as I'm typing this. First off service was great, staff friendly. Best Michelada I've ever tasted! Food was good I had the lunch special, shredded chicken tacos. Chicken was a little bland but that's what salt and pepper is for. The tacos are really big too! I'll definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Okay so my bf and I were looking for a place that had micheladas mean while we went out to edc that weekend . We found this place through yelp let me start by saying the customer service was amazing and so were the drinks.  The food was tasty . The tostadas are a pretty huge serving I only got one but it sure did fill me up and they have two on the lunch special  Oh yeah lunch special amazing honestly this place was pretty cool Oh yeah don't forget they have a cute little burro in the entrance   Only con was I felt the shrimp cocktail had no flavor after I added a whole bunch of stuff still felt something was missing"}
{"text":"This place has some really good micheladas! They put chamoy in them, makes for a really great flavor! Their food is really good too! I watched the NFL game while I ate my tacos."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant with very reasonable prices and great Mexican food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent!!! Two of us got the shredded beef enchiladas and one got the chicken tacos. Our waitress was very fast, however, she didn't speak very much English. That was was kind of interesting. Overall, very yummy food with fast service. Also the chips and salsa was some of the best I've ever had!!!"}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant at arrival but was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. Im so happy I found it and gave it a try. One of the best cheladas Ive had and such great food and so much of it. The service was excellent especially since they only had one server running the floor. Ive been looking forward to going back ever since."}
{"text":"This by far the best Mexican food restaurant in Las Vegas. The food is very tasty, the drinks are good and the service is great. We got the lunch special with the chicken enchiladas with the red sauce. The enchilada was filled full of chicken, the red sauce was very tasty but did not drown the enchiladas and the beans were awesome. We got the 2 for 1 marguarita special on the rocks and they were big and great. There was a generous bowl of hot tortilla chips at the beginning of the meal and the salsa that was served with them was mild but very good. This is a great place to enjoy MX food"}
{"text":"4/24/2018  I revisited Las Micheladas for lunch and it's still great food at a great Price.  I took 3 pictures of my Chicken Enchiladas that is served for $6.95 (plus tax) for lunch.  The Enchiladas came with rice and beans and a cheese sauce with lettuce, tomato, onion, sour cream and it was delicious.  They have great TV screens (11) and play great Mexican Music.  They are very accommodating and if you tell them how you'd like your food, they will follow your instructions.  It is a great place to have a semi-private lunch at very reasonable prices.  I highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"In the pictures it looks pretty tasty but when we get our order the meat it was super hard, it was like trying to chew plastic and also it was too overcooked, the mangoneada was also very salty. D"}
{"text":"Well, I am still looking for a go-to Mexican restaurant in this town. I really wanted to like this place. I ordered a burrito. I asked for it with no beans, but the menu did not mention it had rice so I didn't mention it to our waitress. It came with rice. :'o( The tortilla was dry and hard, like when tortillas get old; I couldn't eat the outside edges. It also said it came with guac; it came with maybe (underline this word and make it bold) two tablespoons in a little cuppie, and the cheapest side order of guac was $7. This is just a personal pref, but I do not like it when the burrito is grilled (like a panini). We also did not get any chips and salsa. Our server was nice and friendly, but we didn't see her after she delivered our food; we had to go get her for extra water and the check."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food & awesome lunch prices! The seafood molcajete is amazing! Super tender & fresh! We also had the hard shell chicken tacos & they were delish! I have been looking for good Mexican food since I moved here 4 years ago & this place is the best!"}
{"text":"Great deals great food tacos are bomb and great service try the micheladas wife and I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Good customer service waitress took very good care of us and the ceviche and micheladas are good"}
{"text":"This is the One of the Best Mexican place I has been ! Good decoration, good food and good atmosphere and attention! I'll definitely come back to try Karaoke on weekends!! Ask for Andreina, very good server"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my niece some of my friends recommended this place i walked in sat my self.The server came and gave us menus and said she would be back we waited for about 2 mins and when she came back i ordered our drinks and went ahead and orderd our food i got a lunch special with the 2 beef enchiladas and i got a side of queso fundido con chorizo. We waited for about 10 mins or so and food came out i was impressed big plate and looked very colorful the queso fundido was awsome one of the best i ever had my shredded beef in the enchildadas was very soft and good taste i really liked how it was just the beef and no veggies in the meat and it came with rice and beans on the side i will come back! 6.99 lunch totally worth it! I will try another plate when i do. So many tvs around and alot of seating. Aswell"}
{"text":"Never been physically in the restaurant but I've ordered off Uber eats about 3 times now aguachiles and they are the best !!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was very bad.  I cant say anything about the food cause i didnt get to try anything, not cause i didnt want too but my order came out wrong and by the time the waitress came by to check if everything was ok (15 mins later)  my lunch break was about to end so i just paid my drink and left. i gave my credit card to my waitress (Ines) she looked at it and said if i didnt have any cash to pay with insead.  Maybe the owner need to take a closer look at his employees that seems kinda shady.  WONT BE GOIN BACK"}
{"text":"They've only been open a few weeks and I've already been there 3 times. I'm on a small fixed income and prior to this opening, I haven't been out to eat in over a year.  Great food, staff and owner. All of that combined with affordable pricing (check out the $6.99 lunch specials) and that = success.  I've been there alone, took a friend and went with a group of 10 and each visit was without a hitch. I just discovered that they open for breakfast. Can't wait to try it."}
