{"text":"First time ordering take out here and it will be the last!  The maki rolls are small with very little fish and are not probably rolled. The sashimi portion is ridiculously small. Feeling ripped off!"}
{"text":"I'm not always a huge fan of all you can eat since I generally can't eat enough to get my money's worth and when it comes to ayce, the quality tends to be lower. Sushi Hama, though, was really good. The price is on the lower end and the sushi was much better than many of the ayce locations I've been to in downtown TO. The overall selection was really good, a wide variety of maki, salads, appetizers, etc, and everything I tried was tasty and fresh. The service was great too, quick and super friendly."}
{"text":"Sushi Hama is... OK all things considered. I have always come for the AYCE dinner and the selection is pretty basic. The quality is fair and they provide a lot of options for people that do not like raw items. You can get things that kids or non-fish lovers would eat, like  the noodles, beef, and eggs. They also have ice cream to finish off your meal.   They have a small selection of sashimi - tuna, salmon, mackerel and beef cover most of that part of the menu. The sushi options are pretty typical, including hand roles and some unique ones to Sushi Hama. But there are no baked roles or anything that sets it apart from other places I have been to.   The bad part is that service can be really slow, and have waited extended periods of time when its not even busy. The restaurant has a couple different levels and its hard for the waiters to tend to everyone efficiently."}
{"text":"Sushi Hama is the best sushi place in Bolton by far. It is clean, well decorated and the servers are lovely. The sushi is fresh and the chefs are extremely friendly and skilled! The all you can eat selection is fair for both lunch and dinner. This is my #1 choice for ayce in Bolton!"}
{"text":"I love it here. Better than sushi date. And also you get short ribs for lunch!! It was really good. They were really busy at lunch today. But I guess because of Christmas. And they only have 2 servers which kinda of weird but they're very nice and the sushi is FRESH"}
{"text":"Haven't dined in here, but thankfully they deliver to Brampton (at least the east side of Brampton) from my experience for a very nominal fee considering it's pretty well out of the Bolton area.  Very simple to order thanks to very polite people. Food is fresh and crafted with care."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favourite sushi places ever.  I have been going here for years.  The outside looks like a house.  This used to be an Italian restaurant as you can tell they left some of the Italian pictures up on the wall LOL.  Service is great and the food is very fresh which I am surprised seeing its all you can eat.  If you are into sushi and live in Brampton or Bolton check this place out.  Don't judge by the outside.  Very cozy."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes and yes. Sushi Hama is my go-to for local AYCE sushi. It's hot, it's quick, the service is great and the place itself is very nice and modernized. I've had a large group of friends there on two separate occasions and they did not disappoint on either one. The staff are all friendly and very helpful. Prices are decent I guess considering the prices of every AYCE sushi restaurant. I believe it's around $13 for AYCE lunch and $25 for AYCE dinner."}
{"text":"We went with a la carte since we're not huge eaters and the menu had reasonable prices. Good for sushi and non-sushi eaters. They forgot our house salad and ended up giving us a larger salad for free. Very polite and fast service."}
{"text":"This used to be our go to place for AYCE sushi a year to two years ago, but we stopped going there for awhile due to some unpleasant stories we've heard. Recently we thought to give this place a second chance. Unfortunately, our experience was not spectacular.   The good part of our meal that is worth mentioning is that  the hot foods that were served were steaming hot and cooked just right. The meat were not dry and they were packing with flavor. However, the sushi and fish portion of the meal was lack lustre and highly disappointing. The maki rolls were not rolled properly and looked oddly shaped. Some of the maki rolls that were offered tasted off and left a weird taste in our mouths. In addition, the sashimi and fish quality tasted very low grade, with colors that differed from other sushi places (AYCE included). The fish was not only very fishy in taste (aka not fresh) but was served at room temperature, which made us feel like they have been left out too long.   All in all, if you were going to a AYCE sushi place for hot foods, then you've definitely found your spot, but I personally would not recommend this place for the fish, sashimi, sushi, and maki rolls. I mean it could have been an off day for them that night, but I doubt we will be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Amazing experience. Delicious sushi. Staff are very nice and the vibe is just wonderful. Very deceiving from the outside. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"My family and I had our dinner at Sushi Hama in Bolton, twice now. Going there the first time I honestly was expecting the worst, the building looks old, the outside looks as though it use to be a bar or saloon sometime in the past. The interior looks confusing with photos of Elvis, The Beatles, and The Godfather, fused in with photos, paintings, and decorations of a Japanese theme, with little Japanese dolls on the wall divider where we had our meal. The cushion seat where we ate was ripped, in general you can argue that it has history and culture, or it needs Reno. The overall space was of a fair size seating area, actually feels cozy, two floors with the latter appearing small from where I was looking. To be clear I didn't care how it looked inside our out... because ladies and gentleman... the food was good, and I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and portions. My wife and I ordered two bento boxes with Kalbi (short ribs), and the usual rice portions, salad, tempura, and soup. We also ordered fried rice among other things, had some salmon rolls as well. I enjoyed the food, and found it to be fresh with the price point being good for what for it is. My son ordered an Ice Tea, we got a cup of it so I don't know if it's the powder mixed kind. They do serve alcohol, since I don't drink anymore I didn't look at the menu... the staff here seems okay, fairly attentive, but raising your hands works better for service... looking around the shop I have a feeling a lot of the customers are locals living in the area. We come from Kleinburg to give this establishment a try, about a 10 min drive North on Hwy 50. I recommend it, for the food and price point, I will definitely return probably with other family members.  *These are my unbiased and fair reviews based on my personal experiences.*"}
{"text":"Prices and quality are both a little bit higher than the alternatives in town.  It is all you can eat but I usually get take out."}
{"text":"AYCE... its ok.  Not the best.  The restaurant is neat... it is in a ranch style house.  There are two floors.  A lot of wood interior... the decor of the house/ restaurant was more imoressive to me than the actual sushi.  If you are just looking for a sushi fix and after the basics... than this place will do the job.  NOTE:  At times they serve half shell oysters (raw) for an additional cost."}
{"text":"5/5 for service for sure. The servers were really nice and attentive.  2.5/5 for food taste and quality. It was mediocre with okay flavour.  1/5 for price. The menu showed weekend prices as $23.99, the posting at the cash showed $24.99 effective January 2018, but we were actually charged $26.99  I wouldn't go here for dinner. It's worth it for lunch, but go somewhere else for dinner."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  Lately I have a place closer to home that I really like but this place is nice too.   I really like the rustic look on the outside. The food is good.  It's an old house on the inside but the place is well maintained. (I like eating upstairs).  Just a good overall place. Wont surprise you with its amazingness, but you will be very satisfied."}
{"text":"I was not very impressed with this place. There sushi rolls are so tiny compared to other all you can eat places. You could also tell the fish was fresh witch is always good. In the end its just a meh kind of restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times but this will likely be the last. Staff is nice and service is good but food selection is very limited and the food itself was tasteless. We didn't enjoy our meal. I would suggest going to the other all you can eat in town."}
{"text":"Solid spot. The food is great and they have great variety on their all-you-can-eat menu. Their sashimi was above average in my years of sushi exploration.   The spot is very deceiving from outside. The atmosphere is fantastic and very cozy. Staff is nice and very accommodating."}
