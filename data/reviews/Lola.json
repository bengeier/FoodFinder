{"text":"Came here for happy hour at the bar and had the skewer squid, skewer mushrooms, and two cocktails.

First cocktail was overwhelmingly licorice (called Greek something, with ouzo and grapefruit), and I really didn't care for it. That's totally personal preference so my review is unaffected by this drink. After a few sips, I asked for the gin/ginger/grapefruti cocktail (specifying a little less sweet because the first was too sweet for my taste) and it was fine. Nothing amazing, but not bad at all.

The skewer squid was smothered in a green sauce, and there was really too much of it. I can only assume the sauce was to cover the freshness of the squid. More than half of the skewered squid was overcooked, which is unfortunate, but not unsurprising. The skewer mushrooms were great, but could have been better charred or smoked, which probably reflects on the method of cooking. I wished for a Japanese yakitori style with delicious char and smoke, but that (to be fair) is probably an unfair expectation. 

Bartender was pretty good, but that's going to completely depend on who you get. I forgot to get his name - whoops."}
{"text":"I believe this is my first five star review on Yelp. I actually had planned giving Lola this review since I ate there two years ago, but I felt that a restaurant has to have more then one good outing before It can be declared perfect. So, I was eagerly awaiting my return trip to Lola for Valentine's Day dinner.

And since you're reading this, the second trip was equally as deserving of 5 stars.

Appetizers: The first time I was there, I had the lobster corn dogs. Absolutely delicious and a great take on classic midwest food (Symon's special talent it seems). The second time around we had the pear and apple salad as well as the Lobster. The salad was light but full of flavor - a classic done perfectly. The lobster had just the perfect sauce to accompany it along with a bit of caviar that added a salty, but delicious finishing touch to the plate.

Entrees: From the current menu (as of today) I selected the squab and fois gras while my girlfriend went with the duck in orange sauce. The Squab was delicious, cooked to a point where the skin maintained a slight crispiness while leaving the inside tender and moist.  I am sometimes worried that fois gras will overpower the rest of the meal, but I had nothing to fear here. The liver mixed excellently with the chestnuts and sweet potato puree while providing a texture complement to the squab. I only had a few bites of the duck, but it was delicious.

We also shared a side of the wild mushrooms. Expected something like portabella mushrooms, but received mini shrooms coated with a delicious seasoning. Better then any fries I've ever had, these are a great side.

Previously, I had the Hanger Steak prepared Medium Rare. It was cooked exactly as such and was a fine piece of meat. Served with Lola fries, whic are traditional fries you might expect to get along with a steak. Personally, I'd say that if you're craving a steak, Lola isn't the best place but you certainly wont be disappointed. 

Dessert: Previously, I had a root beer and cake float. The root beer was served \"granite\" style (partially frozen) and mixed well with the ice cream while the pound cake was a sweet finish. This time around I had the 6am special, which wasn't as sweet as I had expected from a dessert, was savory and really recreated the feeling of french toast.

Drinks: Wine selection is excellent. Had two mixed drinks. Both were strong and well made.

Michael Symon rocks."}
{"text":"Excellent food 

Fresh ingredients 

Delish 

I had the ribeye 

Wifey had the beef cheek pierogi 

Really excellent all around."}
{"text":"Friend and I went to Cleveland for the weekend to see a couple shows and we were amazed with the food we had while there.  First night we went to Lola and it was incredible.  Ambiance is nice, not too loud, but definitely happening. 
We had a cocktail with bourbon and apricot, can't recall the name, but it was delicious!  For starters we got oysters - super fresh and the beef cheek pirogi - which was luscious and homey. 
Waitstaff was super helpful, we asked questions about a wine and they were honest in a very polite way and pointed us to another bottle which again was excellent. 
For our main meal I got the duck which was cooked perfectly and the cabbage just melded beautifully.  My friend got the pork chop which was the size of her head but oh so delicious. 
Unfortunately we couldn't stick around for dessert, we had to run (literally) to make our show on time, but again the server was super gracious getting us out the door very quickly.  Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I have ben to Lola twice, once a few years ago, and just this past Sauturday Feb 18th 2012. First let me say that as far as the food, it's all amazing, but the service is bad, it was the first time I was there a few years ago, but I gave it a pass, as I figured you can always get a poor server who is having a bad night.

After last Saturday, well, I'm done. Here is our experience.

We made reservations for a party of 8 for a special occasion (a 40th birthday party). We arrived and were seated, our server (her name escapes me, it's on my bill, Red hair, thin, glasses and nose ring if you read these Mr. Manager) took our drink order. 15 minutes later we got our drinks, 15 minutes! no apology, or acknowledgement. 

After that service was slow, but after some drinks we were all enjoying ourselves, and we ordered wine figuring we would never get Cocktails on time. As I said, the food came and we all enjoyed our meals. 

The reason for my negative review is as follows. As a party of 8 they automatically added on a 20% gratuity. Now everyone in our party makes a very good living, and we all dine out at upscale restaurants on  a regular basis, so we have no problem with tipping 20%, In fact for great service I often tip above 20%. But having said that, in a much hyped upscale restaurant you should be receiving the best service. This chick could tell we were annoyed (even though we never said anything to her) and made it clear that she didn't care, because why would she, she got her tip.

We had ordered a Birthday Cake from the restaurant ( it was amazing) and when we told her we were ready for the Cake she said, OK, I'll get it, we all looked at her thinking the same thing, Uhm, how about asking if we might want after dinner drinks or coffee, as if we were going to just sit there and eat the cake. So I spoke up and said, I know we would all like some coffee and a list of after dinner drinks and she gave me a shitty look and said \"I'll get the cake and then I'll take your coffee order\" Are you fucking kidding me? 

The moral of the story is Lola clearly employs unqualified, rude serving staff. This illustrates a vibe amongst servers (like her) I see  in alot of these trendy restaurants that seems to prevail where they have this too cool for school attitude that seems to be either encouraged or at least allowed. regardless, this bitch has no business waiting tables in the \"Iron Chef's\" place. Which she actually refered to Michael Symon by more then once, saying \"the iron Chef likes this, the Iron Chef does that\"  seriously, I care?

If you're not from Cleveland and you're buying into the hype, and looking for an amazing dining experience, I would tell you to go to Farenheight. Rocco's food is just as good, and the service is always great. I have been there many many times and never had a bad meal or experience. It's a shame, because the food at Lola is great. But not so great to be treated like shit and pay a 20% gratuity."}
{"text":"Came in on a weeknight with a colleague during a business trip, and I did not have much in the way of preconceived notions or expectations.  Lola was a treat, and everything we ordered was delicious.  

To start, we shared the gnocchi and bitter greens salad.  Gotta love a salad with prosciutto on it!  I had the hangar steak, prepared perfectly with tons of flavor, but the side of fries was perhaps a bit too much.  My colleague ordered the pork chop and enjoyed it.  Entree portions at Lola was large, which is a surprise at this type of restaurant.  A nice surprise, but had I known, I probably would not have ordered a starter.  

Service was fantastic. I noticed only a couple of negatives at Lola.  One, the room felt dated to me, so I wasn't crazy about the atmosphere even though you can't argue that it's not upscale and classy.  My other issue was the use of ipads for the wine list.  At our small table for 2, an extra piece of equipment on top of the menus and table settings felt clumsy.  And I didn't feel that it added me for me, in terms of information about the wine or ease in ordering.  I get that a lot of restaurants are adding ipads into the mix, but it felt out of place and gimmicky here."}
{"text":"This place lives up to the recent hype--our lunch was delicious.  We started with the famed beef cheek perogies, and they were sublime, perfect flavors.  I tasted Nick's beer cheddar soup, it was good (and lighter than it sounds).  Then, our main courses arrived--I had the scallops with butter beans and lamb sausage, and those scallops were cooked perfectly.   I found the selection of dessert to be a little limited, but luckily the chocolate pots de creme was calling my name, so I was happy.  My entire family loved everything, which is quite a feat.  Special bonus: Michael Symon popped in toward the end of our meal, so score one celebrity-sighting."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with the service at Lola. My boyfriend and I made a reservation 5 hours before hand, but upon our arrival we still had to wait about 10 minutes for them to prepare our table. Once we were seated, it took another 10 minutes for a waiter to come to our table with a drink menu. 

On a positive note, our food came out fairly quickly after our order was placed and the food was delicious. The scallops were seared to perfection and melted in my mouth. 

Although the food was delightful, I would probably not go back to Lola. I had higher expectations for a Michael Symon restaurant."}
{"text":"This review is long over due. Myself and three others dined here. This is THE fine dining establishment to try if you are visiting Cleveland from out of town and want an authentic culinary experience. I had booked the chefs table months in advance. The dinner itself consisted of 8 courses along with wine pairings. Each individual had their own server and the chef came out to explain each dish. This was one of the best meals I have ever had. Thank you so much to the staff at Lola for making such a memorable experience reality."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. The food was top notch as is with every Symon restaurant. The service was a little lacking but the place was jam packed so it can be overlooked. My biggest issue with the service wasn't the waitress or anything like that....just that it took almost half an hour after our reservation for our table to be ready. Other than that everything was fantastic. I had the Flank Steak with the trimmings from another dish. I also had a lot of different drinks and some were excellent some were not really my style. All together I would absolutely recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and had drinks and dessert only. Dark and shiny interior with I-Pads to look at the bar menu. Nice wine and beer offerings with decent prices. Based on the bartender's suggestion we went with the famous 6 AM Special which was as delicious as you might think. Highly recommended. Would love to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"We visited Lola a couple of months ago when we were visiting Cleveland. We are Food Network junkies and are a fan of Iron Chef Michael Symon so we had to try his restaurant. We defiantly weren't disappointed. We thought the meal was excellent from the appetizers to the dessert. There was 4 of us dining and we shared some of the food so we could get a taste of many of the dishes. Its a little pricey but we don't mind spending a little more money for an excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"We had the best server, Joseph I believe. All of his recommendations were on point. The hangar steak and mushroom pasta were delicious! The cocktails were great, the mule especially. Espresso and tiramisu were spectacular. Lola is worth every penny."}
{"text":"My wife and I were travelling cross-country, and had never stopped in Cleveland. We'd heard so much about Michael Symon, Iron Chef, that his restaurant Lola was our first choice for dinner. We eat out quite a lot, and have done everything from Wyoming Truckstop to Manhattan Chic. 

This was really boring food. Boring is the worst. What's the point? There was no flavor, no skill, no expertise. It was a very very second rate dinner.

For example, the apps:
The Radish Salad needed to be dressed properly. Ever eaten raw Arugula and Radish? Yumm....
Pork Belly had no flavor. Ever eaten Boiled Bacon?
Pierogi was too sweet, the dough was heavy, sticky, just gross. 
Tomato Salad, again, had no dressing. Tomatoes weren't even that good.

The Charcuterie, while all \"house made\", should have been outsourced. Absolutely nothing good to say about it. No salt, no flavor, nothing. Pate? LIke paste. Salumi? Like flat cardboard. Prosciutto? Dry, flavorless, bad.

Service was great, but holy crap! Lola, do you not know the difference? Did you think this was good food? Honestly, I was much happier eating a Headwich at Fatheads in Pittisburgh, PA.

And to think, I did all this for $120. Noice!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and priced right, thanks to Cleveland Restaurant Week.  Enjoyed every course.  Service was just right.  Chic decor.  Overall, great dining experience.  Would love to revisit."}
{"text":"In Cleveland for the nite & chose Lola due to proximity to my hotel. This was a win. A little pricey, but the drink and lamb shank were both excellent. Nice"}
{"text":"Michael Symon and staff know how to treat their guests.  From the moment you arrive, you are taken care of at Lola's and there is attention to detail.   Very hip atmosphere -- the wine and cocktail menu is brought to you on an iPad.  The staff is very knowledgeable about the menu and wine selection.  Spectacular food.  I've never been disappointed nor my dinner companions when dining at Lola's.  As it is pricey, reserve for the more special dinner occasions."}
{"text":"Ordered a vegan dinner, and got a bowl of pasta. I have to believe that they could do better!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for lunch, dinner or drinks. Great to be Cleveland. ESPN will be here tomorrow."}
{"text":"Lola was really good - the restaurant experience as a whole was the highlight of my Cleveland trip. Had the bone marrow and enjoyed the combo of flavors you could pair with it - bacon/onion jam, some blue cheese delicious spread, parsley, lemon, sea salt. As a first time bone marrower I'd definitely recommend.

Main entree was the pork chops, also delish and tender. But the polenta was easily the star of the dish - sooooo good. Thought the peppers added a nice touch. A fellow diner got scallops and those were also tasty. 

Now for the star of the night: the 6am dessert. OMFG. That French toast is to die for. Maple bacon ice cream was good, but omg the French toast!! Another fellow diner got the sorbets and the pineapple/basil was very refreshing. 

I was a bit disappointed by the service. Our waitress left us hanging more than once and wasn't the friendliest. But I think she was probably an anomaly, as all the others we interacted with were nice."}
{"text":"Just a fantastic meal at Lola.  It's absolutely worth the trip, and Michael Symon has renewed my interest in the Cleveland food scene.  The meal of the Smoked Pork Chop, Hawaiian Crudo, and Maple Bacon Ice Cream were absolutely delicious.  If another plate of the pork chops had showed up in front of me, I would have polished it off.

The only thing keeping this from a perfect 5 stars was that I've had as good, if not better Yellowfin (not in the midwest, but definitely in Hawaii and Seattle).  A solid 4.5 stars, and places him ever so slightly behind Bobby Flay for Iron Chef's in my book.

{"text":"Initially I had avoided Lola since I had assumed it had exoberant prices. Eventually I took out a few co-workers for their last day of work and found that not only was the food absolutely incredible, but it was actually pretty affordable as well.  It's a classy but pretty laid back atmosphere and great segue into a night going out downtown."}
{"text":"The best food in Cleveland and a great bar.   If you want to have dinner here make reservations well I'm advance"}
{"text":"In my simple world, this was a five-star joint.  I can't add anything else to what I've seen in the few reviews I've read so far.

I've been twice; once with a friend and once with my wife.  It was wonderful both times.  Service was excellent.  I did read one review that mentioned the clumsiness of the iPad booze list and probably have to agree with that.  Just seemed a little over the top for two people.

Loved it.  Paid for it, also....but still loved it.  Will certainly return."}
{"text":"My Wife and I came for our Anniversary dinner. All I can say is Amazing! We started with the Florida Shrimp then moved on to the strip steak. So many amazing flavors. Then they went above and beyond and brought us a free dessert that said \"Happy Anniversary\" on it. Total class. Wait staff was super friendly and on top of every need. We will be back."}
{"text":"Really nice place, fun to sit on patio and people-watch. The steak & frites were delish."}
{"text":"Went here with family for dinner and in general the food was delicious. We got lamb, scallops, duck and hanger steak. By far the best dishes were the scallops and the duck. The scallops were perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth. The duck was flavorful and crispy on the outside. The sauces that came with the steak and lamb were delicious in enhancing the flavor but the meats themselves were of good (not amazing) quality. We got the figgy pudding and Yule log for dessert - the figgy pudding was amazing! The poached pears were perfectly cooked with it! The Yule log was Mediocre. The service was superb and the atmosphere was also great. We got a bottle of wine to share between four people which was more affordable than individual glasses. Overall extremely pleasant eating experience and wild come again!"}
{"text":"The best place in Cleveland. The beef cheek pirogi is essential to every visit. The seasonal soups are great and imaginative. For lunch get the baloney sandwich, it's amazing and nothing like mom ever made. The other essential are the French fries, they are spiced to be addictive, and when accompanied by Michael's secret catsup, you will be hooked. Do not miss desert, they are all good but the waffle with bacon ice cream is the winner. And yet it gets better, the wine list is exceptional, good selections and a wide price range respectful of any budget, and it's on an iPad that makes it great fun. All good."}
{"text":"The place is just AMAZING. Was there for lunch today.

Decent food, nice environment - thanks to personnel, clean surfaces (one of my very points :-)).

Definitely once again, as a minimum :-)."}
{"text":"Went here because my wife and I are huge Micheal Symon fans, I would describe Lola as High-End Comfort food. I think the decor is very trendy but I'm not sure because it was quite dark in there. The Service was outstanding.
Had the beef cheek pierogie which was respectable, looking at other tables next time will try the bone marrow.The pork shank and the sturgeon were both outstanding entrees. The Lola fries were very good (and very thin). The 6am Special was a great dessert, but then again how can you go wrong if there is maple-bacon ice cream? The peanut butter and pretzel was not as successful. While not cheap, not a bad value for what you receive as an overall experience (Especially compared to Chicago or New York)
Will return"}
{"text":"As someone that grew up in Cleveland and has since moved to the west coast, I felt a sense of pride coming to Lola's. Michael Symon has done a great job of putting Cleveland on the map for great dining experiences. Although I thoroughly enjoyed everything I had, I would have to say the pork belly (appetizer) and the cavatelli (entree) are an absolute must. The portion sizes are small, but I left very satisfied. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Very good food, excellent service.

\"Lola\" is an over-hyped new American restaurant owned by celebrity chef Michael Symon. \"Over-hyped\" is an observation, not a criticism: the restaurant is excellent but if an anonymous owner were attached to it would not get nearly the laurels that it does. So, onto the particulars:

Food - 4/5. Hanger steak was outstanding. Bone marrow was very good. Pork belly was OK, pig ears excellent. Heirloom tomato salad very bland. Manchego chessecake fusion dessert was so-so.

Service - 5/5. Very knowledgable, prompt, got everything right. The waitress had a touch of pretention but not enough to lower the rating.

Ambiance - 3/5. Loud. Too loud. My wife needed to move from across the table to sit next to me for us to hear each other. We were seated in the quietest section of the place. Not good. The raucous atmosphere was too much for the self-proclaimed best restaurant in the region. You should be able to relax, savour and enjoy.

Don't think we'd go again. Really expensive for the region, and value for money just isn't there. If we got a gift certificate would go there and expect to enjoy it."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Lola with my husband and in-laws the day after Thanksgiving. I will admit I was not completely sold on the idea at first. I will also admit, I was terribly wrong. Lola is a great restaurant.

The decor is beautiful. Very urban and trendy. Spacious and clean as well. We were also blessed with a clearly experienced and friendly server.  

I did not have a drink with lunch, but there was a large selection of beers. For appetizers, we had the pork belly and beef cheek pierogies. I personally thought they were expensive for how small the portions were and they weren't incredibly flavorful. My in-laws loved the apps, however. 

My entree was fabulous, on the other hand. I had spicy tomato bisque. Very light and zesty. Warmed me up! I also had the grilled cheese, which had Gouda, arugula, apple slices and prosciutto. The flavor combination was excellent, very fresh tasting. 

We skipped dessert but I'm sure it would have been delightful. 

All in all, a very classy place with comfort food taken up a notch. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I was here for my husband birthday, so disappointed with this place. Everything is tasteless, does not worth the money, don't bother to come here."}
{"text":"Lola's great. The fried bone marrow is insanely good."}
{"text":"My husband and I traveled to Cleveland for the Eagles/ Browns game on September 9. We made reservations prior to our trip because we knew a Saturday night at a Michael Symon restaurant would be packed. We have been to Roast, another Michael Symon restaurant, as we current live in Detroit. I watch the food network all the time and love Michael Symon. Lola was beyond our expectations. We had a drink at the bar prior to getting seated which was very nice and welcoming. We choice to small plates to share prior to dinner. We had the root vegetable salad and the chicken sausage, both we fantastic. For my meal I had the hanger steak and I read some reviews saying it wasn't great. Well I don't know what they were eating because my hanger steak was out of this world. It was cooked to perfection and top with cilantro and peppers. My steak came with Lola Fries which were great. They are served in a cup so my husband and I shared them. My husband had the ribeye with bleu cheese and onions on top. He said it was so good and he knows his steak. Unfortunately, we did not have room for dessert but that just means we will have to go back!
I have to say we are big food people and this is the best restaurant we have been to. The atmosphere is inviting and not too quiet. The staff ensured that our drinks were full and we had anything we needed. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone going to the Cleveland area. It is right on 4th street which seems to be the place to be downtown. 
Thank you Michael Symon for doing it again! AWESOME"}
{"text":"I was in town last week for business and ate here twice.  Once for lunch with a group from the meeting I was attending then back by myself for dinner.  

At  lunch I had the Braised Bacon which was spendid - beautiful cubes of the pork glazed with a Japanese-like mahogany lacquered glaze.  It was tender and rich with the thin ribbons of fat every so often,  Perfect with some of the warm bread served at the table.  I followed with the Duck Confit Salad with Strawberries, Toasted Hazelnuts, and Goat Cheese.  I have to admit, the pork and duck together in one meal was a bit rich but I was trying to be mindful of costs being with a work group.

For dinner the next evening, I decided to go with 3 appetizers.  I started with the Pomegranate-Fig Martini - great, not as sweet as one would think.  First dish was the Cured Tuna w/Citrus Segments & Fennel.  It was absolutely top-notch - fresh, all flavors clean and working beautifully together. Next up, Crispy Pig Ear with Frisee, Mushrooms & Poached Egg.  I think my eyes rolled back into my head this was so good!  The pig ear was not one piece as I thought it would be but extremely thin ribbons absoluetly crispy and chewy at the same time.  The poached egg was done perfectly, white was set and the yolk broke over the salad giving it the beautiful creamy mouth feel. Finished with the Beef Cheek Pierogi - very good but it couldn't compare to the other two dishes.

I think Lola is a definate must for fellow foodies.  Great food, decor, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love it all!  Will be returning again and again.  Worth every dollar!  Bacon ice cream is awesome!"}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves every singe star... plus some.  My dinner at this restaraunt was the best dining experience of my life.  My entire family went to celebrate a trifecta of achievements (a nine person party) and after checking in our reservation, we were accomodated graciously.

The staff was emaculate, friendly, and helpful.  Our glasses were never empty and our waitress was always quick to answer any questions and give insightful recommendations.

The overall aroma of Lola is highly commendable.  It is very dimly lit with a very relaxing feel and the attire is more dressy than casual.  Every little detail was thought out to provide a wonderful sensory experience.  Even the soft leather chairs stood out as a major comfort point!

The drink selection is highly commendable as they use an iPad (fancy!) to provide options.  They have many exquisite beers, wines, and everything in between.  

While there is not an extensive menu to choose from, making a decision on food was tough as each appetizer and entre is extremely detailed with interesting blends of flavors and textures.  My table ended up getting the beef pierogies and pigs ears (different, I know!) as appetizers.  With an open mind, we found those appetizers to be absolutely delicious, especially when coupled with their fresh, warm, bread.  

Everyone around my table loved their entres.  Upon first look, the portions do not look too big, but they are just perfect.  I got the Salman and have to say that it was the best salmon dinner I have ever had.  The quality texture of the fish along with the delicious gnocchi and artichokes all in a zexty citrusy parsley glaze made my tastebuds sing.  Every single aspect of that entre was well thought out to be cooked, placed, and paired in the most wonderful combinations.  A smoothe harmony broke out in my mouth with every bite I took.  My boyfriend ordered the steak (and I snuck a few pieces...) which was very tender and perfectly seasoned.  His order came with a side of the Lola fries.  The Lola fries were by far the BEST fries I have eaten in my entire life.  Their crisp texture and rosmary seasoning made for the perfect side dish.

Finally, our waitress over heard a toast of my father's and proceeded to bring out mini cupcakes with sparkling candles to celebrate my graduation and my grandparent's 50th anniversary.  Written upon the plates was \"congratulations\" in the most delicious berry glaze. 

I HIGHLY reccommend this resteraunt if you are ever in downtown Cleveland.  As an added bonus it is located on East 4th street, one of the cutest and vibrant streets in the city.  Bravo to Lola... it was worth every dollar and I cannot wait to go again!"}
{"text":"The ambiance was nice.  The staff, friendly and professional.  I had higher expectations of Lola since this is a Michael Symon restaurant.  It's no Bar Americain in NYC, however the desserts are in the same class.  The maple bacon ice cream is wonderful.  The rib eye, not so much.  Too fatty for \"choice\".  The wine selection is nice.
I'd not suggest this for a business dinner, but drinks and appetizers might serve you well."}
{"text":"Michael Symon is by far my favorite Iron Chef!  So, two hours to Cleveland is a walk in the park.  Both my husband and I love to go on one day trips to Cleveland to eat at his restaurants.  If for lunch we love to go to B Spot, Michael Symon's burger joint, for dinner we love to go to Lola.  The amazing food combinations and the carnival of flavors are out of this world! 

The Beef Cheek Pierogi appetizer is a must!  These juicy savory delights simply melt in your mouth.  The Smoked Berkshire Pork Chop is another big hit.  It is tender and succulent, layered on a bed of creamy and rich polenta.  The first time I had this dish at Lola, it was the best pork I had ever had.  Guess what... it is still the best pork I've ever had.  Michael Symon's specialty is pork... well... it shows!  Check my full review to learn more about Lola and the other 6 exquisite dishes and desserts with pictures that we've ordered during our many visits to Lola, such as the Fois & Figs, the Beef Hanger Steak or the Pumpkin Pie to name just a few:

{"text":"I found the customer service lacking. The waitress did not introduce herself but simply passed an iPad at me to look at drinks.  When she came back and I told her it wasn't working she seemed annoyed and simply grabbed the iPad to return with a new one. Special were not told to me.  I was dissatisfied with the overly sweet Savioung blanc and pushed the glass to the far side.  I expected the waitress to address it but she never did.  Not even when I asked for the check and it was still sitting there.  I travel for business and typically spend two + hours dining. I was out within and hour. The scallops while prepared to perfection were gritty. 
I will not be back nor be recommending Lola's."}
{"text":"Amazing dining and it's in Cleveland!   Went here on a Monday during a business conference what an experience.  Asked waiter what he recommended between pork chop and short ribs and he gave a dissertation on each dish describing every ingredient in each one, it was impressive.  Went with the pork chop which was incredible, juicy with a flavorful glaze.  We had started with some spicy tuna and a meat and cheese plate which was also very good.  If you're going to Cleveland put this one on the list."}
{"text":"Food was cold  and bland had to add salt . Poor service at this location . Will not return I expected better."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in Cleveland. I have never been disappointed with anything I've tried here. It's not cheap by any means but it's not nearly as expensive as a lot of people think. The scallops were the best I've ever had. The veal sweetbreads were great also. I ordered bacon wrapped sturgeon (a unique fish in which caviar is made from their eggs) the last time I was there. The sturgeon was cooked so perfectly and the bacon was wrapped so tight and thin that you couldn't tell whether it was the bacon or skin. The service is phenomenal and the owner, Michael Simon is an iron chef and awesome guy. If you could only have one meal in Cleveland you should definitely go here."}
{"text":"As a regular business traveler to Cleveland, it is easy to begin looking for amazing local options. Whether local or not, regular or not, your life will not be complete if you don't make a stop at Lola sometime in your existence. 

Hands down one of the finest dining experiences i've had, and i've been in here probably 4 times in the last 2 months. I am always amazed at the depth and quality of the experience, and this trip was no exception. 

There are two ways to enjoy Lola, and both are extraordinary. First you can score a table at the Chef's table, and this by far is my hands down favorite. When you dine on the road a ton and most of those meals in the evening are alone...this is the way to go. Its a great experience, could be you and 7 of your soon to be new friends, but for a foodie, it is a chance to watch a level of culinary expertise not often experienced. 

All that said, this trip the chef's table was booked, so i scored a simple two top and had some of the best service i've had anywhere, ever...when you go, request Nicole, she is an expert in an unobtrusive dining experience. Great recommendations and not at any point shocked by the amount of food i consumed. 

First course, Beef Cheek Pierogies, unbelievably amazing. These things could be a meal of their own, but i'd need like 10...great plating and the taste is phenomenal. Second I had their soup, which that day was a Black Bean Bisque with a cilantro black bean salsa. Great heat, and a texture that would make velvet jealous. I followed that with the beet salad...never been a beet fan, but this will change any beet hater's mind. For the entrée, it was the Braised Pork Shank...i still can't figure out why they bring a knife with this one...fall off the bone doesn't do it justice, and the flavor...words escape the brillance of the artwork in your mouth that this creates. Now after that 4 course gastronomic endeavor, many would be looking and saying dear lord is he going to live? But at this point you cannot leave Lola without their specialty dessert, the 6am special. All i need to say is its brilliant and it includes bacon ice cream...order it, you won't ever regret that decision. 

So that's the scoop...don't miss out on this gem of the midwest..."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed a memorable meal at Michael Symon's flagship restaurant.  I read other reviews prior to dining and was concerned that we might be disappointed.  Our experience was excellent.  The pierogies were a strong start to the meal, with the mushrooms and creme fraiche accentuating the tender beef perfectly.  I ordered the soup course, a squash broth poured tableside onto sweet crab.  It was a delicious soup full of surprises, sweet/salty/crunchy and a bit of heat.  My wife had the beet carpaccio salad and really enjoyed the blue cheese, rather than the ubiquitous goat cheese, in the dish.  Our entrees were the salmon and the scallops and both were well executed.  The salmon was served on a sweet pea purée with fava beans, artichokes and turnips.  The best bite was salmon with a little purée, yum.   The scallops were perfectly executed and the smoked oysters and chorizo worked to further elevate their flavor.  I love, love, love french fries so we added Lola fries to our entrees.  The fries were thin and crispy with just the perfect amount of salt, but it's the hint of rosemary that makes them special.

YOU MUST NOT MISS DESSERT.  We debated ordering dessert and of course ended up with two.  My wife opted for the Sticky toffee pudding, while I had the 6am special.  These desserts are other-worldly delicious.  If I lived in Cleveland it's dessert that would bring me back to Lola.  I eat in restaurants of this caliber fairly regularly and I've never had desserts that have driven me to obsession like these.  I'm not even going to bother describing them.  GO AND HAVE DESSERT.  My wife and I agreed that if we'd have passed on dessert we would have missed the best course!!!

Finally, service (our server was Hannah) was excellent.  The front of house team had the magical talent of appearing exactly when needed and being invisible when not."}
{"text":"Terrible planning of reservations. We walked in with a party of 3 (me and my elderly parents) right when they opened at 5pm. The entire restaurant was empty. They said they couldn't seat us until 9pm because all of the tables were reserved at 530pm and we could sit at the bar.  I can't tell my elderly parents to climb up on a bar stool. How do you not leave a single table open for walk ins? AND leave the whole restaurant empty for a half hour at minimum. You're a restaurant in Cleveland. You're not that awesome to be turning away customers."}
{"text":"Outstanding! I had the smoked pork chop and a side of mushrooms. It was the best meal I've had in Cleveland. I will go here every time I'm in town. I sat at the chef's table and it was truly impressive to watch them work. If you have to choose one place in town, make it Lola."}
{"text":"I worked downtown for years and never tried this place b/c I assumed it was too pricey for lunch. Finally, a friend took me there for a going away lunch. It was amazing and I can't believe I missed out on it for so long. A really fun, innovative menu. Foods are combined in a way I would never have imagined, but the flavors complement each other beautifully. Also, excellent service (unpretentious) and modern but comfortable decor. I look forward to visiting again when I'm back in town.

Cleveland has a multitude of restaurants that blend in but an inventive chef makes Lola stand out."}
{"text":"Underwhelming and overpriced. I expected so much more based on the reviews.  I've eaten all over the country high and low and quite a bit outside the US. I've sat down at many a restaurant with almost identical menu offerings and prices as Lola, so I had a preconception as to how the night was supposed to go.  Not so in the case of Lola. 

As a starter we got the chilled lobster with avocado and grapefruit.  I had to order it because I love the avocado/grapefruit combo. When I took the highly anticipated first bite, I was so let down. There was nothing pulling all of the flavors together. The grapefruit was overly bitter and overpowered the dish, and I dig bitter.  

The S.O. and I both ordered the hanger steak. It supposedly came with a pickle sauce and chiles and rosemary fries. I tasted no pickle or chile in the dish, and the fries were EXTREMELY salty.  I kept trying to rub the salt off of them to make them edible, but that really didn't work.  And the rosemary they used appeared to be dried, not fresh.  The medium-rare steak I ordered came out rare, but i was ok with that.  Most of the entrees appear to be \"complete meals\", but the steak was basically al a carte.  That would have been good to know when we ordered our steaks, as we were craving a veggie side once they came out and at that point, was too late to order one.  The only thing I was OVERwhelmed by was eating a big slab of meat all by itself.

Dessert: Split the coconut pecan chocolate cake.  It was dry and had a strange texture, and, you guessed it: totally underwhelming.

Service? Definitely on the slow side.  We got our bread after our app.  Waiter would disappear for stretches.  

One plus I did find was that I thoroughly enjoyed the Willamette Valley pinot noir I ordered.

Also of note: the table we were at was freezing cold and also it gets very loud in the restaurant.  Let's just say it's not a great date spot.

I could be a bit harsh on Lola, but I absolutely hate being disappointed by food that I have high expectations for and paid a lot of money for."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. We took several people from out of town for work (from Philly) and they were blown away. 

The portions are small and you will pay to fill up but it will be worth it. The food is very imaginative and local food is used. They also cure their own meats in the restaurant. How many places do that? Order the 6am Special if you like breakfast. The maple bacon ice cream is amazing. The crab gnocchi was a great appetizer.

The service was great. The waiter was extremely knowledgable about the menu."}
{"text":"I love this place. Even just appetizers and wine at the bar is a treat. I've enjoyed everything I've eaten here, even the desserts, and I am really not a dessert person. The service is great, it's like casual fine dining. It's so easy to have a predictably delicious meal and an easy relaxed experience here."}
{"text":"Great place for a nice glass of wine and a fantastic dinner. Downtown Cleveland suffers a bit from lack of nice evening dining. This place is centrally located and the menu is top notch. Michael Symon the chef has created a little gem in the heart of Brown's country. 

The bartenders are great even when they collide rushing in for fast service."}
{"text":"The environment is \"5 star\" the dish I had was 3.5 (smoked pork chops).  Presentation of the dish was excellent, flavor and texture above average but not a dish that makes you go \"wow\".  Basically, paying for the environment and wine selection available."}
{"text":"Love Lola!  Very good pork chop which I understand is the dish to order.  Sat at the bar and had excellent service and enjoyed my meal.  I'd like to dine here with a group. The wine list was great  and I'm sure it would be fun with more people."}
{"text":"Cocktails, service, dinner, atmosphere...all fantastic! Couldn't have asked for a better evening."}
{"text":"Michael Symon was the draw for dinning at Lola's.  The restaurant is beautiful and has great ambiance.  The exposed kitchen is interesting to watch.  The meal was enjoyable but not stellar.   Go once just for the experience."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner here. We had oysters and marlin for appetizers which were both delicious. The soup was fantastic. I had the roasted chicken which was great but a little salty. Dessert we had the mint chocolate chip. It didn't last long at our table. The only downside was the noise. We couldn't have a decent conversation due to surrounding table noise levels. Otherwise this was a great experience."}
{"text":"Lola is one of my go-to spots whenever I'm in Cleveland (yep, most of the time)  and decide to walk the 500 yards from my condo to E4th.  I especially love lunch at Lola and if you haven't had the lobster bisque on a chilly day, you need to soon.

However, I was pleasantly dismayed to see Lola closed on July 4th.  What?  The Iron Chef America empire isn't forcing his crew to work on what's probably a slow day?  What about the hungry cookout refugees?  Oh yeah, they're well fed.  Well, what about the random NYC tourist?  Yeah, must be unfathomable.

Bravo to Michael Symon for allowing his staff to attempt to live normal lives while still offering some of the best food this \"perennial contender\" has to offer."}
{"text":"After living many, many years in the LA and Orange County area...this place is a foodie bargain.  $11 for 1/2 of one of the yummiest Vietnamese-inspired sandwiches ever and an inspired cauliflower soup that was to die for.  And from such a well-respected chef! Come for lunch...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"WOW!!!  Simply mind-blowing experience.  We tried everything we possibly could and were amazed by all of it.  We sat at the Chef's table overlooking the kitchen and had a blast watching the cooking staff.  A great atmosphere in the restaurant, fairly trendy and relaxed but great decor.  Apps included beef cheek perogi, pork beelly & pig ear, crispy veal sweetbreads and crispy bone marrow.   And everything was out of this world.  The sweetbreads were slightly crispy on the outside and soft and very soft and delicate on the inside, one of the best things I've ever eaten.  The pork belly was great with very crispy strips of pig ear.  The calfs heart entree was to die for.  So tender and tasty and the duck confit was some of the best I've ever had.  I don't think I'll ever visit Cleveland without going back to Lola."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner and was surprised at how busy it was for 10pm! The service was amazing here, they were very attentive and quick to explain the menu items. Even the food came out decently quick!

To start we had the ceviche and beef cheek pierogis. The ceviche was nice and fresh, and kind of reminded me of sashimi. The beef cheek was super tender and yummy. I ordered the duck and had bites of the short ribs, scallops, and pork chops (they were all really good!). My duck entree was a big portion and the flavours were awesome (I really liked the mole sauce).

To end off, we got the 6am special which is the french toast with caramelized apples and maple-bacon ice cream. We literally finished it in less than a minute and honestly, the maple-bacon ice cream was amazing. 

Overall I really enjoyed this resto even thought it is a bit on the pricier side. Can't wait to try out Lolita the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great wine list! Loved the paintings and the atmosphere of the restaurant. We sat at a table next to Michael Symon's parents!!! Very cool!"}
{"text":"Best steak I ever had in my entire life... so tender and juicy that you could cut it with a fork!   Great service, too!"}
{"text":"Having eaten at a few Top Chef contestant restaurant's around the country, I can confidently say that Lola's ranks in the top few. Everything from the apricot whisky cocktail to the sous vide lamb are so memorable."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and nice decor, although flies or gnats hovered the whole night. Cocktails were very good; try the Old Fashioned. Charcuterie board tried to be different (focused on meats, no cheese) but missed the mark. Pork chop was tasty. $100 per person with drinks."}
{"text":"So I walked into Lola tonight for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend quite skeptical that it would live up to all the hype.
We walked in at 7:20 for a 7:45 reservation and were pleasantly surprised when our table was ready.  We sat down and were handed the menu, which is short and concise and frankly a breathe of fresh air compared to places like Cheesecake Factory whose menus are so long they sell advertisements.  Our waiter came over and handed us each an iPad to peruse the drink list.  While this is a cool way to sort and search through the list it was slow and slightly difficult to navigate.
Based on our food choices the waiter suggested the Lulu 62 which I guess is a house wine named after Michael's wife Liz.  It was very fruity and smooth and was a nice compliment to our food without over powering it.
We both started with the Beef Cheek Pierogi and immediately I was blown away.  I LOVE pierogis on a whole other level than most people and was afraid it wasn't going to taste like a pierogi at all.  Somehow with it's beefy goodness and savory/sweet sauce it still had it's pierogi roots.  If I wasn't so full right now I'd want another one.
We decided to split two entrees (which we usually do because we both are usually deciding between the same two meals).  I started with the Smoked Hampshire Pork Chop because many of the reviews here on yelp suggested it.  This has a good amount of pork so if you're really hungry this will definitely fill you up.  The cheesy polenta was great with the nice slices of pork...It made me not miss the applesauce (I have not had pork chops in about 10 years and my mom always made it with shake and bake, applesauce and tater tots).  
The other entree we got was the duck with sweet potato gnocchi, kale, cranberries and mushrooms.  This was AMAZING.  I had never had duck and the meet itself was great, crispy seared on the outside and juicy/pink on the inside.  The gnocchi, kale and cranberries really created a full flavored bite when I was able to wrangle one of the cranberries onto the same fork full.
And then there was dessert...I love that we were able to have an appetizer and an entree without feeling like we were going to explode and couldn't eat dessert.  Especially because I got the 6am Special...I don't think I have to say anything more than: brioche french toast, maple bacon ice cream and caramelized apples.  The boy got the key lime which was a deconstructed key lime pie of sorts with lime sorbet.  I had a bite of his and it was really good, much lighter than my breakfast of champions/dessert.
The perfect ending to this birthday dinner was a passionfruit white chocolate in the shape of a heart.  Delicious.

My biggest complaint would be that the two top tables are longer than normal and my boyfriend has bad hearing, so we couldn't easily have a conversation without everyone around us hearing it.  At least I know for the future I will need to ask for a four top or a different seating arrangement so we can hear each other."}
{"text":"Wow. I was in Cleveland this past week attending a conference, and some of us went over to Lola (my mother is recently obsessed with Michael Symon and was dying to go).
Despite it being a Friday night, our hotel called over and they were able to get us a table very quickly. The area the restaurant is set in is lovely - you couldn't help but take picture. We were seated very quickly, and had a great spot near the kitchen. Service was great - very attentive and helpful, and more than willing to keep the drinks coming. 
The food was nothing short of amazing. The bibb salad appetizer was delicious. As for the main courses, we had a variety of meals - prime rib, arctic char, scallops, and potatoes for our vegetarian - and they were all so delicious. The peach melba was absolutely fantastic. All of our meals were very filling, but yet nothing felt heavy. It was easily one of the best meals we've ever had, and made our visit to Cleveland much more memorable."}
{"text":"I've only eaten at Lola once, but that meal ranked in my top ten eating experiences, which include heavy hitters like Alinea, Bobbo, Next, Burt's (Melrose, Scotland), and Buddukon. My wife and I decided to heed the title of Symon's cookbook and order a flight of carnivorous delights: bone marrow, lamb heart (garbanzo beans, harriza, heirloom carrot), and pork shank (heirloom beans, fennel, meyer lemon). The bone marrow and its accompanying condiments were without doubt the best I have ever had. Unlike most restaurants, which serve the marrow in the sliced bone, Lola removes the marrow in chunks, breads them lightly and then sautees them. To choose an unappetizing analogy, the result looks like gourmet cheese sticks. The veneer of breading provides a wonderful contrast in texture to the succulent marrow. We went to St. John in London last year, which is famous for its marrow; Lola's concoction made theirs seem like canned meat. I won't go through all the condiments, which provided a nice range of sweet, tangy, and salty that we enjoyed mixing and matching to produce new tastes. Our favorites were the pear chutney and the lightly pickled onions. The stand-out entree was definitely the lamb heart, which has a smoky flavor and the consistency of wagyu beef. The suppleness of the heart was set off beautifully by the crunchy fresh garbanzos and the slightly leathery paper-thin carrots. The dish was also a piece of eye-candy: dark-red slices of heart wearing a crown of purple, yellow and red carrot shavings, sitting atop a green pool of garbanzo puree. The brilliant dish had tough competition from the pork shank, however--which likewise offered an array of tastes and textures: the tenderness and sweetness of the meat set off by the licorice-like flavor and crunch of the fennel. Warning: this dish could easily serve two and is certainly not for the svelt of figure. My wife ordered it, and gasped when she found that it was almost the size of her head (lucky me--I got half). The same was true of the desert:  maple-bacon icecream with brioche waffles. Unlike the pork shank, this was defined as a dish for two. While the taste met the standard set by the earlier ones--crunchy, salty bacon meets velvety icecream meets chewy brioche--the chef could work on the proportions: either make it a single dessert with one less waffle (a dessert for one) or add a scoop of icecream. We were out of the latter long before we finished the dessert. In sum, I would recommend Lola without hesitation--inventive dishes, fresh ingredients, and the friendly, unassuming service that one would expect from your neighborhood bar. We will never be able to go to Cleveland again without visiting this gem."}
{"text":"I've only been to the recently renamed Lolita once.  It was the best dining experience I've had in this area to date.  It's a trendy little place, and was quite busy when we went there on a weekend evening.  Our server was wearing jeans and a black tee-shirt.  The decor was eclectic, and seating was slightly crowded.  It was the food and menu that had us hooked.  The best short ribs I've ever had!! The small bites were curious and delicious including meats that are cured in house, and other creative dishes.  The dessert was wonderful. My husband ordered a flourless chocolate torte that had a touch of chili flavor; it just melted in our mouths.  We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Wonderful service.  Met a business client here, was phenominal."}
{"text":"Was there to celebrate my husband's 40th.  The food was excellent but hospitality was not so great.  We were a little disappointed after we left but after speaking to the manager he was very apologetic."}
{"text":"Top notch. Excellent service. Exceptional food. Pierogi appetizer was wonderful. You could order three and simply make that your meal. Scallops were perfect, accompanied by pork belly  and a subtle-yet-spicy sauce. Possibly the best scallops I have ever had.

Also visited bar, and it, too, had excellent service."}
{"text":"Went here a couple weeks ago, have always wanted to go! The set up is so nice, love the dim lighting! Tried the bone marrow, was much better than I expected! Gotta be willing to go outside of your comfort zone though, it's a menu for an acquired taste. Overall, it's a lovely swanky little bar on È. 4th!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Exceeded my expectations. Sometimes theses celebrity chef restaurants can be 50/50 but not Lola's. Dinner was great and dessert over the top, homemade pumpkin ice cream with an almond sugar cookie. Wow!!! Can't wait for Mabel's BBQ."}
{"text":"Amazing New American dining experience in Cleveland. Wonderful, friendly and warm service, delicious nuance of flavors and freshness in everything served. Gracious from beginning to end. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is so good that last night between the appetizer and the main course, my mother and I made a reservation to come back the next night.  It was that good.  The only negative was the snarky know-it-all bartender. Other than that the service was terrific.
Here's what we had, all highly recommended:  Beef cheek pierogie (a must, do not even THINK about not eating one.  Even if you're a vegan or something.).  Walleye on creamed corn.  The walleye has become my new favorite fish.  Limited availability thought.  The charcuterie plate.  It changes daily.  Nothing on it was short of delish.  Finally, the hangar steak.  
We sat at the kitchen table and observed the quiet chaos in the kitchen.  It was a delight.
Can't wait to go back again.  Tonight."}
{"text":"This place has really good food! I got beef cheek perogies as an appetizer, and it was so savory and delicious, but way too much for $12. But prices are really not what you care about if you choose to go somewhere like this. My entree was magret duck, which was awesome. The corn, mushrooms, and peaches went well with it. It was my first time trying duck. It's like a gamey steak. Also, the dish had a good amount of heat to it. The only dessert I had was a cupcake they gave me since I told the server that it was my birthday. I would come back here again, but only on special occasions since it hurts my checking account."}
{"text":"Delicious, classy, and wonderful service. They even brought out cupcakes for my husband and I for our anniversary! The only thing I would say is the price for 5 clams was ridiculous. The steak was some of the best I've ever had. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Whmmm - this one is a toughy for me.  As much as I would love to give a higher rating, I'm stuck at 3 stars.  On a whim my boyfriend and I ended up at Lola on a random Wednesday night for a late dinner.  I was really excited we picked this place because I had been interested in dining here for a LONG time and was finally getting my chance.  Upon entry, the decor makes this restaurant easily able to compete with any of the best in NYC, Chicago, etc.  The vibe is very romantic (thanks in part to the sexy furniture and dark mood lighting) and would be perfect for date night.  

We were seated immediately and handed an iPad complete with drink menu (which I thought was innovative and fun).  We ordered a drink each, all of which I can remember is that they were very good.  We then placed an order for salads - mine with fried pig ear (yes, I said pig ear - don't judge!) and the boyfriend had pork belly.  Here's where things started to go wrong - our server forgot to bring my salad (boyfriend received his right on time) and we both had to remind her two more times (when we could manage to flag her down) that I had ordered the salad, to which she responded that she'd bring it right out.  Our entrees arrived - both of which were very good - and I had still yet to get my salad.  I did eventually get it halfway through my meal and it was given to us free of charge, but at that point I couldn't enjoy it to the full potential of deliciousness that it had.

The meal and vibe were really great, but the service was poor (for a great restaurant that wasn't close to 100% full) and the bill very expensive.  It will definitely take some coaxing to get me to go back here, but I'm also willing to give it another try."}
{"text":"** 100th Review!! **  YAY!!!

It was pretty hard to decide what my 100th review would be.  All I knew was that my \"review\" not only had to be a place that definitely super duper wowed me with their delicious dishes, but also wowed me with their spectacular service!  Lola's, one of Michael Symon's restaurant, was the winner!!!!!

The occasion: My brother's 31st birthday
Reservations: For 3 @ 9pm
Server: Steve
Appetizers:  Pork Belly & Beef Cheek Pierogi
Entrees:  Rib Eye: medium rare, Smoked Hampshire Pork Chop, & Alaskan Halibut
Dessert: 6am Special & Mandarin Bavarian & Chocolate Cake 

First, let me say that all food items listed are a MUST TRY!  The pork belly appetizer was melt in your mouth delicious!  It also had a nice crisp to it... like crispy bacon with the nice thick fat in between.  Loved the beef cheek pierogi too!  It was nice it came with 3 pieces, one for each of us to enjoy.  The beef was nice and tender inside the dough of the pierogi, which had just the right consistency. 

Next the entrees.  My brother loves steak, and always orders rib eye where ever it's served.  Let me tell you that my brother seriously had died and gone to heaven with his rib eye!  His medium rare was cooked to perfection!  He has yet to find another place that makes their rib eye this good!  My sister's pork chop was tasty as well.  Again cooked to perfection!  Even then next day when she ate the leftovers it tasted just as good.  My halibut was very good.  It was flavorful and not over cooked.  Next time I'll try the salmon.

Lastly the best part of the night!  Dessert!  If you don't have room for anything else, make room and order at least the 6am special!!  Even though you only have one bite it's THE dessert to try! MMmmm, I think it's the maple-bacon ice cream that did it for me!  

Wonderful atmosphere, and our server, Steve was awesome!  Very polite and  attentive to our needs at the table, and checked up on us a good amount of times.  It's nice to see our server really enjoying his work.  Gave some good recommendations on things to do around town as well as interesting facts about the city.  Thanks Steve!

Again, 5 STARS!!  Loved the place, food, and service!"}
{"text":"Had the Oyster app. Duck and Pork entrees.  Nothing exiciting about the Lentil soup but then again it is Lentil soup.  Everything was outstanding.  Service was perfect.  The spirts matched well with our meals.  Desert was sinful but not overdone.  Kudos Stephen."}
{"text":"iPad drink menu is impressive; ambiance is romantic but food is just ok."}
{"text":"Went there on a business dinner.  Not too large of a group.  Only 8 people total and the staff was awesome.  I had heard all about this place and was excited.  I have to say it was underwhelming.  We started with the beef cheek pierogi which was OK.  I had heard they were AMAZING and wanted to try.  The oysters were also OK.  The star was the fois gras.

My entree was between the clam bake and the pork chop.  I love pork chops and almost always get them but the clam bake sounded interesting.  The waitress said the pork chop was the specialty so that made my decision.  It was decent.  The guy next to me got the clam bake and we were both surprised when it was brought out.  We were both expecting it to look different but he ate it without fuss.  Wasn't much to it really.  The menu said it contained sweet Ohio corn but we looked all over the plate and couldn't find it.

Everyone ordered dessert and I got the Tiramisu which is my absolute favorite.  When it was placed in front of me, I mentioned to the waiter that I ordered the Tiramisu.  I assumed it was another persons dessert.  The waiter confirmed this was a deconstructed Tiramisu and exactly what I ordered.  My high hopes were quickly brought down to reality.  I actually ordered a tawny port to end on high note.

I was going to take my wife there, but I won't go back.  Too many high quality restaurants in the area.  This was just high priced food for what you got."}
{"text":"I was visiting from Northern California for my sister's birthday and decided to take the whole family to Lola to celebrate. There were seven of us, so not too large of a party. It was a delightful surprise to find E 4th Street a vibrant exciting spot in downtown Cleveland. Lola is exactly the kind of restaurant you want to find there. I heard that Symon had just announced the opening of a second restaurant on the same street.

The cuisine was inventive, wonderfully flavorful, and artful. My sturgeon was perfectly prepared, surrounded by smoked clams. Yum. Lola would win five stars for that, as we all came away floating on food heaven. Save room for the clever and delicious desserts. Customer attire went from dressy to casual; so not a stuffy establishment.

What tripped up the experience was the service. For a restaurant of this caliber, almost everything missed a beat. The staff seemed hurried and unfocused, and a bit unknowledgeable about what they were serving. There was an attempt at the kind of service (simultaneous and elegant delivery of a course) that I've experienced at, for instance, Aqua in San Francisco, but the ball was fumbled. It didn't seem like the restaurant was full (a Thursday night), but the time between the starters and entrees was quite long; with a server stopping by to \"see how we were doing\" multiple times during that wait. \"Managers\" also stopped by to \"see how we were doing\". Were they worried?

It could have just been an off night. I will definitely come back, and would ask for a seat at the counter overlooking the kitchen. It would be fun to watch the creative action."}
{"text":"The food and service was great.  It was expensive but we really enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"We went to Lola during lunch one day and it was a lovely restaurant.  It looked very modern and still welcoming.  I've lived in Cleveland about a year and I've noticed that the foodie bug has bitten- and how!  It's neat that so many places around town take good food and unique dining SERIOUSLY!  

My coworker had a grilled cheese that looked very good.  I can't recall what the other woman we ate with ordered.  The bread we were served was delicious.  I had mac and cheese (not actually made with macaroni).  It included chicken.  I'm a bit picky about chicken.  I'm almost certain it was dark meat- I hate that!  

I immaturely picked out the chicken and ate just the cheesy pasta.  It was really very tasty, however; I don't think it was anything unique.  Perhaps I should have tried a different dish to get a taste of something more indicative of the chef's style?  The price was decent for lunch.  I think mine was about $15 and my lunch mates spent about the same.  I think it was a bit much for what I had, but; a decent price for those looking to experience dining at a place created by a celebrated, famous chef- it's not a bad price.

I also must say that I'm quite certain that I am not a foodie and prefer eating a different sort of food.  I hate most things fusion and tend to enjoy much more simple things.  For people who are into stuff like that Lola is a good choice."}
{"text":"We went to Lola's for a celebration and everyone in the group is in agreement, Lola's was just OK.
I have heard mixed reviews about this restaurant from many people but of course I wanted to taste for myself!

Drinks were mediocre at best. The Ipad idea for a menu is wonderful for a younger clientele but this restaurant brings in a variety of ages, have a paper copy of some sort for the older guests. And unimpressed with their drink and wine selections.
Appetizers were tasty the pork belly and pig ear were delicious.
Pork Shank was an extremely large portion. It was tender and flavorful for the most part but what would set this dish into amazing would be a delicious sauce paired with it.
We may or may not be visiting Lola's in the future."}
{"text":"I went to Lola's for lunch during the weekday. I was expecting love at first food and I didn't get it. SO disappointed. I had the spicy tomato bisque which tasted like canned campbells tomato soup and the tuna nicoise tasted like canned tuna. Our waiter was also a complete douche--we waited around for 10 minutes just for some water, while ordering he tried to push every imaginable dish on us, didn't come around and ask us how our meal was, and pretty much ignored us because he know he would get more tip out of the 8 top seated right next to us. If you want good Michael Symon food go to the B Spot... best damn burger I ever had and it doesn't cost $6 for 4 oz of soup."}
{"text":"Was very pleasantly surprised here -- wasn't expecting much since celeb chef's offspring are usually oversold. Not so here. 

Started with a beef cheek pierogi that was out of this world, and followed that with the Lola burger. If you get the chance do not pass this by: it's served on an English muffin that lets the burger itself really shine. Delish!

We finished with the Pots de Creme, worth it for the vanilla creme on top. A great experience, great ambience and none of the snooty BS you tend to find and restaurants like this. The focus was instead on the food, where it ought to be."}
{"text":"Food: our dinner was delicious. I ordered the lamb shank and a side of Lola fries. It was very tender. The sauce was a little salty for my taste but my wife thought it was perfect. She ordered the sturgeon. Excellent with subtle flavors. We also had the special appetizer which was a fruit foie gras with crostini. My first foie gras experience.  It tasted good but was very rich.

Service: top notch. Our water glasses were always topped off and the staff was exceedingly polite and competent. 

Atmosphere: a great mellow scene with dim lighting and the noise level was an excited hum rather than an annoying clamor.

Price: this is my nke point of contention. You get what you pay for but at Lola you pay a bit more for the Michael symon brand. I didn't feel cheated but it's definitely not a bargain."}
{"text":"As far as restaurants go in Cleveland, Lola is the place to be! We came in town hungry thinking we would yelp a great restaurant to have dinner at. We came across Lola and decided to try it out since it had so many reviews, and good ones too. Little did we know that this is one of chef Michael Symons restaurants, located in the heart of the night life alley of Cleveland!!!

I'm not going to drag this review out but the bottom line? We made the right choice coming here! The food? AMAZING! The Roasted Cauliflower was truly STUNNING! The Celery Root soup special was shockingly GREAT! The Honey Glazed Pork Chop will make you look at pork in a whole new light!! Absolutely life changing! The Peppercorn Crusted Sirloin was cooked to perfection!! And last but not least... DO NOT leave the restaurant without getting an order of the Lola Fries! You have never had fries like this before! Fleshly cut, freshly cooked, and seasoned in a way that will make a grown man tear up! 

PS- Desert?... Two words... Lola S'more! Wow!!! Wait, that was three words..."}
{"text":"Thumbing through the reviews on Yelp after visiting Lola for myself, I have to say that I am pretty surprised with the general consensus.  Perhaps if I hadn't gone in with the high expectations associated with the Michael Symon franchise and bolstered by the great reviews, things might have turned out differently.  But as it stands, I only remember biting into one of the famed beef cheek pierogis and thinking, \"this is it?\" 

I've eaten some truly creative, unique dishes in my life, as well as some truly great preparations of the simple classics.  I was expecting both walking into Lola, and I was shocked to receive neither (and that neither came with a hefty price tag).  The one exception was the 6 a.m. special dessert, which was inspired and delicious, but it's hard to forgive the transgressions of the rest of the meal simply because of a great dessert.
   
If you are swimming in cash, it is certainly worth checking out.  The food wasn't bad, and Lola is an icon in the area for better or worse.  But for the financially conscientious diner, you can do a lot better for the money.   As a student who eats out at a restaurant in this price range a handful of times a year, I wish someone had advised me to take my business elsewhere.  There is a lot of hype surrounding the Michael Symon brand, and that brand is what you pay for when you eat at the restaurant-- not an earth-shattering meal."}
{"text":"Great place. Michael Symon is doing it right. Not a single bite was disappointing from first to last course."}
{"text":"Had to go to Cleveland for a day and a half.  While looking around for a place for dinner saw that there is an Iron Chef restaurant not too far so that just seemed a no brainer.  Was kinda hoping to see Chef Michael Symon, but at the same time wasn't REALLY expecting to get that lucky...I wasn't.  

Drinks are ordered via an iPad which I know is gimmicky, but darn it, i liked it.  Had just binge watched some Mad Men episodes, so I ordered an Old Fashioned since Don seems to like them...for me it was...okay.

OMG, they have bone marrow on the appetizer list... YESSSS.  It was awesome.

Rib eye was good, but visually I wasn't thrilled by the presentation of having this pile of green on top of the steak.  Oh well, to each their own.

If you come here, you have to get the 6am special dessert (no, its not only available at certain times, that's just the name of it).  Maple Bacon Ice Cream is involved...enough said."}
{"text":"amazing food, a little pricier but worth it. If you go early or later (after 9:30p) they have a shorter happy hour menu that has smaller portions of their more popular food for less expensive."}
{"text":"Overpriced for the quality.  Just like B-Spot you are paying for the Mike Symon name.  The question is will Mike ever change the menu????  I have been here 4 times in the last 3 years and always the exact same.  Yawn"}
{"text":"Went for late night apps following an Indians game. Wonderful! Had the lobster and pork belly apps and both were great."}
{"text":"I come to Cleveland about 5 times a year to play at the House Of Blues and I like to pop in to your restaurant and enjoy the food which has always been good.

BUT your staff is fucking horrible your hostess to night called me and IDIOT and laughed at us. She was in a bad mood since the minute we got to your restaurant and she even gave a dirty look when she was out back smoking cigarettes! 

I travel the world doing what I do for a living and I have never ever been treated the I was today the hostess doesn't not belong in the restaurant business I will never eat your restaurant again nor will I recommend it to all of my fellow musicians that we tour with"}
{"text":"Really good food and service. A bit pricey but worth the trip occasionally. The bar area is also fun and they have some tasty drinks on their menu."}
{"text":"I was excited to try another Iron Chef restaurant.  My experience here was even more enjoyable because I go to see Bill Clinton a few blocks down!  If you go soon, get the squab!  

I think it is a fairly new item because it is not on the website's menu.  Apologies that I didn't take a photo.  I tried, but the aroma was too intense to wait any longer to eat.  

Portion was a bit tiny and I don't eat a lot, but more reason to get an appetizer and dessert!

For the appetizer, we got the beef cheek pierogie.  It was good, but I'm not so sure why it's so special?

The squab was prepared med. rare on a puree of butternut squash.  I'm a sucker for butternut squash so other details may not be 100% correct.  It's a thin layer of butternut squash with something diced and dried cherries.  The cherries was such a perfect compliment to the meat of the squab.  Then it was a nice piece of seared foie gras on the side with some greens. 

My dining partner ordered the black bass with mussels, potatoes etc.  The sauce was more herbal than we both expected.  It had a faint aroma of chinese herbal medicine.  The fish was good, not sure if we'd go for seconds though.

Dessert we ordered the 6am special because nothing else really stood out and we wanted to see what the hype was.  It was actually really good!  The syrup, french toast, ice cream and apples just meshed together so well.  I was hesitant at first with the ice cream since it had bacon bits.  But the salty/sweet combo proves its success once more."}
{"text":"Travel and eating in great restaurants are two of my favorite things.  For me, making a trip anywhere means I spend some time researching the food scene.   As a fan of Iron Chef I just had to go to Lola's while in Cleveland on a business trip.  

We were a little late for our reservation, but called ahead and they held a table for us. The food was outstanding and the service was equally as great.  I enjoyed the Tuna appetizer and my date the Crispy Bone Marrow.  For my entree I had the Salmon which was cooked perfect.  Plenty of food, but not one of those plates you can't or shouldn't finish.  Each bite was better than the last.  My date enjoyed the Halibut.  For desert he had the French Toast with Bacon Ice Cream, I enjoyed the Fruit Cobbler with Apricot Sorbet.  

At the end of the meal, our waiter was kind enough to tell us some other great places in town we should eat as well as of a festival called the Taste of Treemont that we're headed out today to explore.  

Next trip to Cleveland, they will see us for sure!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, delicious, perfect lol.
My parents and I were in town for a conference this past weekend and this place was recommended to us. I don't pay attention to celebrity chefs personally. But Lola's is the real deal. Nothing that we ordered was bad, NOTHING. Pork Chops were outstanding and the creamy polenta! Ugh I am salivating just thinking about it! Their Salmon, roasted corn and potatoes were all just as wonderful.
I'd never heard of this restaurant before but am already planning my next visit!
A must when visiting Cleveland!
Oh! Just be warned, it's quite pricey. But worth every red cent!"}
{"text":"Not sure I can add much that hasn't been said...doesn't get much better than this place, at least in my experience and for the sort of money I can afford to spend on a meal.  Incredible food (I grew up eating pierogies, and certainly mom never made them like this!)...the crudo was super fresh and tasty, bacon wrapped sturgeon delicious.  Lots of things featured chanterelles, which made me extremely happy as a huge chanterelle lover...definitely appreciate them including in season foraged stuff!  Very nice scotch list, with some interesting items I hadn't seen before (they had an Ardbeg I had never tried, despite thinking I had tried them all!!).  I literally wanted every item on the menu, so will be going back next time I'm in Cleveland.  The atmosphere was nice, without being overly fancy or stuffy.  Waiter was fantastic, just the right level of attentiveness without being annoying.  And to top off the experience, seated next to me just happened to be the band Foreigner...not that I'm a big fan or anything, but a memorable experience nonetheless :)"}
{"text":"Isn't it great to get what you want?

We had had a great visit so far: lots of home-cooked food, plenty of time to chat with family and play with nieces and nephews. But after supervising the umpteenth art project, we wanted to enjoy a nice meal in a restaurant with a hang-out-a-while atmosphere. 

So we snagged a late reservation at Lola. It was outstanding!  Both appetizers and three of four entrees were flawless -- much love especially for the trout and the duck confit.

What strikes me most is that we spent the entire evening pleasantly engaged with our dining experience. So many times, I eat at one restaurant and talk about other food during the meal. Here, though, we were only talking about what was or would soon be in front of us.

Two last points: 1) wonderful service; 2) the pastry chef is the supreme master of playful deliciousness."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. I really am. I'm not a foodie, so I'll let other people comment on the food. The service needs a little bit of work, though. This is somewhat minor, but with these prices, I expect impeccable service. It's a little weird when the food runners (who are probably given incorrect info by the server) serve plates and drinks to the wrong people throughout the meal. Also, I'm not hard of hearing, but I could barely hear the server when he came to our table. This wasn't because of the noise level. He just talked super, super quietly. Of note was that the old fashioned didn't come with a large ice cube. Granted, it's a personal preference on my part but I'm surprised that in a restaurant like this that it's not standard."}
{"text":"White shrimp app was ok. Needed more flavor instead of relying on the broth. Halibut was cooked perfectly. Staff was attentive and meal was paced accordingly."}
{"text":"Lola is perfect for you if you aren't very hungry and you really like meat.  I knew that coming in, but was slightly shocked when I saw the portions (very small) and they  only have 1 pasta dish on the menu.  Then its only meat. Literally all meat.  Nothing but meat. The pig ears were a pretty good app and they also had amazing scallops. I did see one large steak dinner so if you're hungry, pick that one.  Their margarita and drink selection was also very good, although expensive for what you can get at the same bars on east 4th.  Don't get me wrong, I like trendy, expensive restaurants that are different and exciting but I probably wont be back to Lola.  I enjoy carbs a little too much."}
{"text":"For all the hype, I felt sad leaving Lola.  My entree was over seasoned. The pea tart was the most outstanding flavour of the whole meal. And the desserts didn't sound overly appetizing. I really prefer Lolita in Tremont."}
{"text":"The only thing breathtaking about the restaurant is the decor.  Pretty amazing.

No complaints about the food but just not as good as everyone else's experience.  I ordered the lamb entree and it was alright.  Maybe something was off that night but it was too salty for me.  Got the mango desert and it was amazing!  So beautiful and delicious.

Make sure you get the fries!"}
{"text":"Ok, the food is good. The flavors are delicious and new...it's good stuff.  However...when I pay $150 bucks for dinner, and I have a full 3 course meal,  I shouldn't leave hungry.  I realize portions are small at fancy restaurants, but thus was just ridiculous. My appetizer was 3 bites, my halibut entre was like 5 bites and the desert was equally small."}
{"text":"When I come to one of the top meat restaurants in the world I expect the meat  to taste like meat. Unfortunately that is not the case here.

Very nice and expensive atmosphere, friendly and knowledgeable waiting staff. The menu is good. I like small menus and it looked like it had a had great veggie options. 
The soup was really excellent, parsnip with pearl barley and wild mushrooms. Really really good. 
I had the rib eye for my entree. Not so good. I asked for medium. It was a little under cooked for my liking. But the main problem was the flavor it had that awful mesquite flavor. They should tell you about that. It did not taste of meat. It tasted of a grill. it's hard to describe. When I come to one of the top meat restaurants in the world I expect the meat  to taste like meat. 
The dessert was delicious the lemon semifreddo is amazing, truly delicious !
the coffee was bitter but the sugar was in packets and they had lots of sugar in the raw, so full marks on that , unfortunately they had no Grappa.
the meal cost $75 plus $14 for the tip, not bad but I expected a better tasting steak for the $39 it cost.

So marks out of ten:
Atmosphere and Staff - 8/10
Starter - 8/10
Entree - 2/10
Dessert - 9/10
Coffee - 4/10
Price - 6/10 

Would I go back...yes but would order something else and ask them to let the customer know if the meat has been flavored."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Lola. We loved the Bone Marrow Appitizer. Had a great bottle of wine and absolutely loved the Scallops. The steak was way too spicy for us, but the manager went to great lengths to make it right for us. Brittany, our server, was warm and engaging and made our dinner that much more special. Thank you, we will be back!"}
{"text":"We loved it here!  It's on the fancier side, and the food is a reflection of that.  I will be going back asap."}
{"text":"Went here to have a nice meal with my wife celebrating our anniversary. Here's our visit. 

Ambiance

The restaurant is lowly lit and holds a feeling of intimacy and romance. Tables are set with a simple white table cloth with a single candle in the center. One other yelper described their furniture as sexy and I agree. Sleek and sexy. Although the whole restaurant seems fancy the wall of pigs that are first seen from the front door let me know that this place isn't going to be pretentious. I hated their silverware though. I wanted a normal fork and not a squiggly design in the handle that kept my hand from ever feeling secure in its grasp.

Service

When we approached the front desk we were greeted warmly by a well dressed host. Although we were a tad late for our reservation, thank you Avengers movie for closing down whole blocks for filming, he was all smiles and quickly assured us it was no problem and that our table was all ready for us. After we were seated with menus, a busboy came by and gave us water. We then sat with our menus and water for about 15 minutes. Just sitting and reading and drinking water. The same busboy came back and refilled my girl's glass even before we saw anyone that resembled a server. An odd start but I saw that they were busy and didn't stress. When we finally did get someone to take our order he was very nice and was able to make suggestions and answer questions. He was also very paitient with my wife who was having issues making a decision on what wine to get. The one problem with the service though is that after the drinks were served and the food orders taken I really didn't see too much of our server. I would see him walk by quickly now and then but getting his attention was almost impossible. Workers running the window would come out and deliver the food to our table but when I would ask something from them, like ketchup, they seemed to have more pressing responsibilites for my request was forgotten. I even dropped my steak knife on the floor while eating my pork chop and the server wasn't around to ask for a new one making me eat my meat with a butter knife. And using that silly fork teamed up with a dull butter knife just made my time with my entree taxing.

Food

Appetizer: Goat Cheese Onion Tart. A tasty humble sized tart. Nothing amazing. Actually had a better tart with the same concept in a brewery in Galena, Illinois. Good but just hoped this tart would have been better than some brewery's version.

Entree: Smoked Berkshire Pork chop. The only thing wrong about this dish was of my own doing. After ordering the entree my server suggested to have it cooked medium and I agreed. I've never eaten pork cooked under well or medium well. I thought there was always a rule somewhere that pork shouldn't be undercooked for safety reasons, but I figured this restaurant knows what it's doing and I went for it. Bad move. Though the pork was well seasoned and delicious there were some bites that had a prominent limp texture that was chewy and unpleasing. The cheesy polenta was amazing and worked really well with the bbq sauce and pork and onions but the sometimes off pork was a mistake I wish I could take back. If I did it again I would have had the pork cooked longer and of course not drop my steak knife on the floor.

Side: Lola Fries. After reading on yelp that their fries are cooked in pork fat I needed to try them. Sadly, they were a misstep and disappointment. The fries are extra thin shoe lace fries cooked to a deep crisp and then dusted with rosemary. They were basically potato sticks you get out of a can from the gas station. I even asked for some ketchup to help out the situation but it never came and I was stuck with what I got. The pork fat made no difference in flavor to me and I barely ate any of them. They are potato chips and not french fries and I wanted french fries.

Dessert: The 6 a.m. Special. The bacon laced ice cream has the nice salt and sweet aspect going on. An issue though is that once the cream melts all is left is a mouthful of pork and therefore I would never eat it alone as normal ice cream. Thanfully it's presented in a nice breakfast food environment and it works well. The maple syrup and french toast added with the creamy bacon ice cream is a unique and tasty combination that is certainly a must try. 

Final Thoughts

 I wanted to love this place but I can't. Yes, I had some good food but with the service being off and on, the silverware not letting me enjoy myself, the very limited and mediocre vegetarian options for my wife, and significant price tag, my heart cannot show too much affection for this place. Is it worth a try? Yes. Especially if you are visiting Cleveland like I was and are a fan of Michael Symon like I am. But, I'm afraid this was probably a one time thing. A check mark on my \"restaurant to-do list\" and little more."}
{"text":"Holy Smokes, Symon is a genious!

Came here on a whim and walked out with a smile.  Visiting for work, hooked up with some friends and had quite possibly one of the 10 best meals ever.  Service was over the top professional - everyone, I mean everyone knew what the other was doing, it was like an orchestra! Our server had been there since their opening and loved her job! Can you say that?

Food:

Starters - were awesome, Beef cheek pierogi,  Gnocchi

Soup - Black bean (sound bland try this one)

Mains - Lamb Loin (wanted to order another), Duck, Hanger Steak, Pork Chop (will get next time - It is Chef Symon)

Desert - Cheese platter, excellent quantity and quality

Wines are presented with an Ipad but ordered with the wait staff, wonderful selection normal mark up.

Kicker of the night, one of the owners was kind enough to send over some cigars for our table to enjoy outside! Really over the top.  

Bottom line, I will be back and will send everyone I know travelling to Cleveland to Lola.

Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I was very pleased with my visit to Lola.  I had been there last year for a work event and let's just say that the magic was missing.  This time, we went for Cleveland restaurant week.

First, I loved the decor upstairs especially the lighted marble bar (beautiful), and this really stood out in comparison to the non-descript, dreary, draft conference room downstairs (pls fix this Lola).

My appetizer, the ceviche, was good.  Loved the hot peppers and the fish was good quality.  My entree, the cod with flageolet beans was simply amazing.  The cod had that brilliant seared crust (which I have tried for years unsuccessfully to replicate at home) with perfectly cooked fish underneath.  My partner had the calf heart (which he swore by, but trust me, I will never, ever try).  His dessert, the lemon pannacotta, was very, very good.  The one less than stellar dish was my dessert.  The chocolate bavarian dessert itself lacked panache and the cranberry chutney it was served with was very, Thanksgiving, if you know what I mean.  

 The service was also great - prompt, courteous, efficient  And, when we simply mentioned that my partners entree did not appear to have mushrooms, as described, within minutes, we were brought a bowl of hot, fresh, seared, really amazing french horn mushrooms (I could eat those all day).  I will definitely be back to try again !   xxxooxxoo Lola !"}
{"text":"The food and drinks I had were flavorful and unique, however, what made me score below 4 stars was the service and lack of full menu on the patio,   (I would give this place 3.75 stars if Yelp allowed).  Though the food was what you would expect from a restaurant owned by a celebrity chef, the service was pretty slow (Monday dinner service), and if you want to sit on the patio and enjoy the sights and sounds of 4th street, you have only a very abbreviated menu of apps and drinks to choose from."}
{"text":"Cleveland's downtown upscale dining experience IS Lola. Anniversaries, business meetings, interviews, birthdays - hold them at Lola.

We stopped in for lunch yesterday, which we'll focus on for this review, although we've been many times for everything from charcuterie and cocktails to full dinners.

The three of us each had a glass of wine (highly recommend the Michael Pozzan Caberent Sauvignon if you always wish you were a hip red wine drinker but don't want your palate overwhelmed by bold dryness). We then split a pulled pork sandwich, a Lola burger (served on an English muffin), two soups and an order of beef cheek pierogi.

The special late summer soup was a spicy sweet corn tortilla soup. It wasn't overtly spicy - just enough heat to make it interesting - and was not particularly heavy. The tomato basil bisque actually families pretty well - again, just a bit of heat and fairly light as bisques go.

Beef cheek pierogi are a must-have for any non-vegetarian diner (and the veg crowd might want to consider a brief expection), particularly if you're visiting from out of town and are wondering \"what's a pierogi?\" The beef cheeks remind me of carnitas, because there's a wonderful balance between crispy and moist tender meat.

The burger is served on an English muffin, and is quite satisfying just like the pulled pork sandwich. One of the big highlights of each are the now-notorious (and often copied) Lola fries - shoestring fries prepared in duck fat and then tossed with salt and rosemary. Yes, that's right, the fries are prepared in duck fat which sounds wrong but tastes delicious.

Everything was delicious, and lunch for three with wine at a fine dining establishment for $80 isn't bad. If your goal was frugality, you could have lunch for $9-12 by sticking with water and a sandwich. This would be a HUGE step up from most of the downtown eateries and not really represent a big budgetary increase.

Save room for dessert, or more specifically the \"6 a.m. special\" - french toast with maple bacon ice cream. Divine!

And, whatever you do, do not call it Lola's. It's just \"Lola.\""}
{"text":"Another very good meal on 4th St.  The salmon, halibut and duck were all prepared perfectly.    2 of us had the fennel and lobster soup which was very good.  The location is great for the Tribe or Cavs games.  You cannot go wrong here."}
{"text":"Excellent! Great food and atmosphere. The hanger steak and oysters were great!"}
{"text":"Came here for a few special occasions and to see if the food lived up to the Iron Chef hype.

Food [A] The overall quality of the food is quite good. Their signature dish, a massive pork chop is juicy and well seasoned. The only downside for the dish is the Midwest's current obsession with creamy (too easy to have runny) as opposed to grilled/seared polenta (personal pref for texture). The true standout here is the 6 AM special. It's a dessert that captures the perfect combination of sweet and savory with maple bacon ice cream, caramelized apple, served on french toast. I'm not big on desserts, but I came back to this restaurant within a couple days just to order it again. It's that good. The beef cheek pierogi was a tad on the salty side, but well balanced by the mushrooms. Another of my favorites was a duck breast dish that they no longer serve. It went through several iterations, including an Asian-ified (mediocre) as and a more classic French interpretation (much better). Ultimately, you are paying extra for the experience of eating at a celebrity chef's flagship restaurant.

Service [B+] For the prices and reputation of the restaurant, you would expect to be waited on hand and foot (or at least not have to make simple requests numerous times). Waitstaff here are less than attentive on multiple occasions, and their tone/attitude decidedly adds to the observation of the sub-optimal atmosphere as noted below.

Ambiance [B+] The feel is definitely classy, but almost in the wrong way. It's like an inexplicably oppressive snootiness, with a \"dress up or die\" vibe. Some of the waitstaff here can give off a sense of entitlement, while giving some leeway considering that this is a top-rated restaurant in Cleveland, however, having such airs is also somewhat antithetical with the service industry and puts a damper on the dining experience. Seats are comfortable and lighting is ideal. Spacing between tables is also well positioned.

All in all, you can't go wrong with Lola as long as your wallet doesn't need to be resuscitated by the end of dinner. If I could give 4.5 stars, I would just to ding them for the service and ambiance, but I still think it's awesome that Symon has done a lot with the restaurant scene of his hometown so I'll round up instead of down."}
{"text":"I went here because everyone in Cleveland was downtown smoking pot waiting to riot in the event the Cavs lost game seven. The waiter was hairless from head to foot. The police were encamped in the cemetery across the street with orders to gun down the populace en masse should the worst occur, so I really tried to enjoy my steak. At the end of the meal we were given free chocolate covered fruit, a small solace with death so close. Have you ever seen Les Mis? It was like that. I give this restaurant five stars for historical accuracy and period detail."}
{"text":"Just fabulous! Lola is one of Cleveland's finest restaurants. Dinned here Saturday evening and was very impressed. The only thing we didn't care for was the lobster appetizer. It was more like a cold lobster, mayo based salad, so not my favorite. The main courses on the other hand were fabulous. We ordered the pork shank and scallops, both cooked to perfection. Service was also wonderful. The atmosphere is modern and chic, perfect for any occasion. Highly recommend this fabulous restaurant!"}
{"text":"Lackluster and very disappointed, expected more for a $250+ dinner.  First of all they delivered an iPad with a wine list, the list said nothing about the wine ratings nor did it talk about the contextual details of the wines.  The server knew nothing about the wines.  A wine steward delivered the wine, we commented that the wine was considerably sweeter than expected, he said in an uppity manner \"you should have talked to me first.\"  Really??? Where was he when the server knew nothing, nor did she offer to bring him over.

We ate two appetizers, one was the scallop ceviche and the second the beef cheek pierogi.  The scallop dis not smell fresh and had inexpensive, lower quality olive oil poorer over it with a fine minced pepper and chive--- with all of this almost no flavor.  The beef cheek while tender (as cheek should be), was bland and was not broken down through the stewing process with any sort of complexity--- worse than your mother's pot roast--- pot roast with a wine reduction would have been better tasting even without being tender.

Going onto the salad- the peach salad was well prepared but nothing that couldn't have been constructed in the average house- fresh peaches, basil and goat cheese.  For the main course I had the smoked pork chop with polenta.  While this dish had a nice smokey flavor it was laden in significant undercooked fats layers--- too fatty and should have been rendered more.  My wife had the salmon, which had sat too long after being prepped.

Desert- deconstructed tiramisu- a total disaster.  This dish attempted to be trendy but it missed the mark.  The bread materiel (sort of like ladyfingers) was not properly dressed with coffee, instead they used a gelatinized coffee/espresso in little squares.  They then missed the mark on what should be significant amounts of mascarpone, but ended up being very little.  Their attempt to add chocolate was multiple (too many) dollops of what tasted like chocolate ganache (cocoa dusting would have been right).  Very poorly executed and dry.

I currently live in Washington DC and just spent a week in Chicago prior to this visit (both very good culinary towns).  I was exited that Michael Symon inserted himself into Cleveland, a cool burgeoning culinary scene,,, but this restaurant does not live up to the name he has made for himself.  Waste of money."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here with my wife, sister in law and brother in law. I was very excited when my brother in law was able to secure the chefs table. As a chef it was fun to sit there and enjoy watching other chefs working hard at their craft.

I had the bone marrow as an appetizer. No one else at my table were really bone ,arrow fans and they loved it as much as I did. I could go back just for that! 

My brother in law got the \"bacon\" as his appetizer. It was a healthy portion of braised pork belly and it was amazing. It melted lime butter. 

For dinner my wife had the hanger steak and it was in perfection, the pan sauce was rich and delicious. I have a hard time ordering hangar steak now because I don't think it will ever be as good.

My main course was the Smoked Berkshire Pork Chop with cheesy polenta and grilled peppers. Let me just say that I LOVE all things pork and believe that a properly cooked pork chop canneasily be better than any steak. This one was just that!

The polenta was creamy and rich, the oan sauce was nice and salty and deep brown with a lasting intense flavor that combined with the polenta perfectly. The onions and peppers were sweet and smoky and added this perfect little treat in the middle of the meal.

The pork chop was cooked perfectly! Juicy and thick! The bone added so much flavor and was CLEAN when I was done. I don't say this often but I will saynit now...

BEST RESTARAUNT MEAL OF MY LIFE AND CAREER!

I dream about that pork chop.

The dessert was also great. I had the 6 am special. It was 2 small pieces of French toast with maple syrup and maple bacon ice cream with gold flake. Such a great way to end the meal!

The service was fun, warm, and inviting, everything fro. The food and service to the neighborhood was amazing. I can't wait to go back to Ohio just to hit up Lolas again!"}
{"text":"Michael Symon's Lola is one restaurant that does not go unheard of in the Cleveland restaurant scene. After hearing all the hype, I decided it was finally time to give it a shot. This spot has a great local reputation, and is also well-known outside of the city. Being on East 4th in downtown Cleveland, the location only adds characteristic and value to its aura. Once inside, the vibe is nice with dim-lit lighting and a reasonable ambiance. 

As expected, the service was nothing short of quality, with servers being very personable, as well as providing of recommendations. I ordered the Peppercorn Crusted Sirloin and coupled it with some regular red-wine. All in all, the food was pretty enjoyable, and offered some unique flavor. I think I may have set the expectations a little too high, because of how well others talk about it. I did think it was a little over-priced for the type of meal I had as well. All in all, I would recommend for others to experience this at least once. There are many great restaurants in the Cleveland scene, and this one maintains that reputation."}
{"text":"I went for lunch on April 15, 2013 and Ordered Tomato Bisq and Lola Pork sandwich and the Soup I Ate Should NOT be on the Menu, it has NO Flavor and the bread if Thats what you call it, was To HARD to chew!  They should Serve Something else for Bread during LUNCH! The Sandwich was GREAT! The SIZE was POOR! The same as Cutting a Sandwich in 4ths....Your serving SIZE IS the 4th One Bite and it's GONE!  Looks LIKE I NEED to Try DINNER since THATS what Folks are going for!!!  OOoooH, Yeah...I did Order Desert! DO NOT ORDER CHOCOLATE Pot de Creme!!!! Just Open a A PUDDING Cup throw 4pieces of Carmel Corn on Top And There's THAT!!  

Maybe DINNER will be Better! If Your Looking For the WoW FACTOR like I Was Then STAY at HOME!"}
{"text":"I bought my parents a lola gift card for christmas because i heard it was great, 6 months went by they didnt use it, they went on vacation and my girlfriend and I broke up, what do I do, I take that gift card and drown my sorrows in some exceptional food and wine. I started out with the beef cheek periogies, out of this world and then some. Never had bone marrow before this night, that was a mistake, ammmaazzing. Halibut entree perfectly cooked(my favorite fish) no exception. with like blood oranges or mandarins or something whatever it was went well with it. followed by some dessert i dont really remember it was a memorable meal, breaking up with the broad sucked but i couldnt have made a more delicious meal myself, perfect timing for my parents to be gone."}
{"text":"This was easily one of the best meals we've ever had ... period.  It may have helped that we were seated at their chef's table!  

- Beet & Pear Salad - YUM!
- Bay Scallops, Gnocchi, Braised Oxtail, an AMAZING sauce!
- Cape Cod Oysters on the Half Shell
- Beef Hanger Steak pickle sauce, chiles, lola fries - WOW!
- Rib Eye smoked blue cheese, wild mushrooms - double WOW!

Wines:

Ben Glaetzer, Heartland, Shiraz, South Australia, 2006 - Good
Michael Pozzan, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cuvée, Napa Valley,  2007 - GREAT!

It's about the food here ... which is SPOT ON perfect!  Especially the sauces ..."}
{"text":"Food is amazing.  Place is electric.  Even though your pocketbook hurts a little afterwards, it's always worth it."}
{"text":"Finally got to experience Lola by Michael Symon. I've always seen him on Food Network but never had the opportunity to stop by. A business trip brought me here so I had to visit.  If you're in Cleveland, this is a must experience. The food was amazing and downtown Cleveland is just full of energy.   

I had the Lamb loin, appetizer shrimp, and side potatoes. Wow! I slowly savored every bite.  

FYI, they sell autograph cook books! $19 and $35"}
{"text":"We went here last night for my birthday after having heard all the hype. I indicated both in the online reservation on OpenTable four days in advance and on the phone two days in advance that I am allergic to eggs and almonds (I also mentioned that it's a birthday dinner).

We got to the restaurant and were seated, and it became clear that the waitress had not been told about my food allergies, which is already unusual for a restaurant of this caliber when having been told in advance (twice). 

The food was fine, but nothing to write home about. I had the lobster appetizer and the scallop entree. The lobster had a nice citrus sauce but was too chewy in parts, and the scallops were fresh and in a decent sauce (with some goat cheese and melon), though again, not the level you expect for what's supposed to be one of the best restaurants in town. By the way, the noise level was also so high that we spent much of the meal in silence because we could barely hear one another (I suspect we were seated in the louder half of the restaurant, FYI). 

Our waitress was actually very nice overall, but there were some slip-ups related to - I suspect - communication issues with the kitchen. When she brought out the bread, she did not mention that it contained eggs (I asked and then she confirmed that it did and I shouldn't eat it). Then when it came to dessert, she told me that the kitchen said the 6am special and one other dessert don't have egg or almonds, and when I said \"are you sure?\" she immediately realized (to her credit) that this couldn't be correct. She went and asked again, and it turned out that none of the desserts except the sorbets are free of eggs and almonds.

Note that this is a restaurant that is ready to prepare entire tasting menus based on people's food likes and dislikes, so this just doesn't cut it. Sorry, I am not a fan of sorbets, and thus my birthday dinner ended dessert-less. 

I am not impressed, and I particularly recommend that people with food allergies stay away."}
{"text":"My friend & I went to Lola to celebrate my birthday. It was a wonderful restaurant. We had the BEST appetizer ever - the Poke. For dinner I got the pork shank and he got a steak. The portions were large and very filling which was fine except we were having dessert. The dessert was good. The only reason this place isn't getting a 5, really, is that it didn't live up to it's hype. I've had so many friends claim how wonderful it is, but I thought it was good, just not AMAZING."}
{"text":"Michael Symon doesn't mess around. The man doesn't just know food - he knows GOOD food, and he does it right. Lola presents a perfect combination of understated elegance with absolutely delicious, down to earth, comforting cuisine. 
On my visit  I had the charcuterie platter, flank steak, lola fries, asparagus, and a hot chocolate and the donuts for dessert. Everything was to die for 
and cooked perfectly.
For us Clevelanders, Lola has become the epitome of just what our city can offer - a great culinary experience from one of our own. It is a definite go-to for anyone who is looking to impress out of town guests, family members, or a first date. You just cannot go wrong, even if you tried. It will be the best dining experience you have ever had. SIX stars!"}
{"text":"How many times can Lola be reviewed...I can't say anything that hasn't already been said. It's the best restaurant in cleveland. That's it."}
{"text":"Had dinner two nights ago and it was amazing!  The service was exceptional and the care they took because I have food allergies was above and beyond my expectations.  Everything I ate was cooked exceptionally from the roasted cauliflower appetizer to the hanger steak that was cooked perfectly.  The best part was the fries!  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience! 

We enjoyed a sumptuous Monday lunch and everything was incredible. 
We started with the beef cheek pierogi and it was amazing. Tender dough, flavourful filling and meaty mushrooms. I can still taste it! 
My husband then moved on to the fried bologna sandwich, while I enjoyed the Mac & Cheese. His sandwich had crispy bread, thick bologna and great additions of dijon and cheese. He loved it! My pasta was super creamy and perfectly al dente. What can be such a simple dish was masterfully prepared just a delight to enjoy. 
We were full so we skipped dessert, but we look forward to coming back on our next trip to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go to in Cleveland for a special day! Nice vibe, good location, good food."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with Lola the staff was friendly but the food was not so good. No it what I was expecting to see. I looked up the menu for here and after arriving what I have found was not on the menu. So not wanting to go somewhere else I found a substitute. It was only okay. For what I was served was way over priced. I think the owner should look into finding some time to get back to kitchen."}
{"text":"TLDR; I cannot recommend this place highly enough. It was my favorite restaurant for the four years I lived in Cleveland. 

The best (and frankly also the only worth mentioning) fine dining game in town. I lived in Cleveland for four glorious years, and this restaurant is certainly in my top three restaurants I would make a special trip back for. Dress up to come here, you'll feel classier than you thought Cleveland could be. Order the beef cheek pierogis; it's practically a law in these parts. And then send up a silent thank you that not all celebrity chef restaurants are coasting on just a pretty face.

The décor is memorable. The long amber bar seems lit from within, giving a sexy glow later at night. And to ramp up the sultry vibe there is a bright vermillion nude hanging next to the wine-fitting to show two things to get drunk on right next to each other. While the restaurant is not tiny and always busy, there's enough nooks and crannies to get a sense of intimacy at many tables. The staff is also very accommodating to people who are having a bit of a Goldilocks moment and want to change tables to get just the right one. 

The chefs here are very dedicated and run an extremely tight ship. I will temper this with saying the food isn't the most revelatory you can have in the USA. This place is not trying to reinvent the wheel, and has no interest in following the austere 24 course prix-fixe small tasting stuff that some of the higher end chef driven restaurants try these days. Plates of food are big here, and normally full of things you've heard of. You can tell they start with very high quality ingredients and then prepare them simply and perfectly. The menu here is a bit unfriendly to vegetarians, but there's always at least one vegetarian entrée and appetizer. If you don't eat meat, are on a restricted diet of any kind or are even gasp! vegan, let the servers know and they can get the chefs to whip you up something special. I've had great off menu vegan food here just for kicks and giggles to put the kitchen through their paces. 

I would recommend the calf's heart, the beef cheek pierogis and their seasonally changing fish (normally halibut or cod) preparations. So saying, the entire menu is stellar. 

If you want unusual or especially creative, the pastry chef here is insane in a very very good way. She has a stunning eye for plating, is a flavor pairing savant, and walks the perfect line between savory and sweet in her desserts. Many of them I occasionally, years later, dream about.  

As I try to sum this up, I realize I'm not writing a review here so much as a thank you note for a restaurant that managed to transcend for me a mere place to eat. I imprinted on this place when I moved here like a baby duckling imprints on its mother. This is the kind of place that embodies why I eat out to begin with. It fosters an environment where you can mingle with brand new interesting humans. It helps us bond with these new interesting creatures over darn good food that fills you up but doesn't weigh you down. It has a creative pastry chef that does dishes you would have never dreamed of, and makes them accessible and tasty. It has a menu that changes but not so much you feel there's no consistency. I took from this restaurant not only delicious food stashed away in my ever growing spare tire, but I took fantastic memories and good friends from my years of being a regular patron."}
{"text":"I'm quite a foodie and have to say that the food was spectacular. The beef cheek pieroges are not to be missed nor is the 6am special. No question that this is one of the best in Cleveland. Our only complaint was the hostess at the front who had a horrible attitude. Otherwise lola gets 5 stars."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 5 stars as I'll outline below and also, in case some reviewer gives it a lower rating this will counterbalance it in the direction I feel the restaurant deserves. We went for a quick lunch during our visit to Cleveland to see the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame.  It must've been a slow day in the city because it was easy to find a parking spot.  The place was easy to find and we were greeted promptly and seated.  The restaurant was surprisingly crowded and everyone seemed quite satisfied.  The ambience is modern and upscale and I found the majority of tables to enjoy some degree of privacy.  The noise level was low.   The lunch menu has quite a few choices and our very detail oriented and observant waitress recommended the fried bologna sandwich (something unique I was tempted to try) but decided to stay off any fried stuff today.  We settled on pork schnitzel for the lady and I ordered the scallops.   Both were excellent and the presentation was artful.  We wound up sharing half and half.  I was also amazed by these wonderful potatoes which seemed like baby idaho or maybe some other type I'd never seen before.  We also enjoyed and can recommend the asparagus salad which comes with warm asparagus accompanied by arugula and goat cheese.  I found it to be a good deal too.  So 5 stars because of ambience, service and food, and location in downtown."}
{"text":"Delicious. Fresh. Perfect.

Excellent Service, beautiful surroundings..

I look forward to my next trip back to Ohio so I can return to Lola. 

*sigh* maple bacon ice cream..."}
{"text":"After asking a ton of locals, \"where's the best place to eat?\" and receiving the same answer \"Lola.\"  We had to go and luckily, we were able to secure Thursday night reservations at the Chef's Table. 

Michael Symon's restaurant was worth the hype. The unique cocktail menu (try the ginger/grapefruit gimlet) and wine list set the tone for the dining experience.

The daily soup selection was a roasted corn chowder.  The solids were served in the bowl with the broth poured tableside. Delicious. 

Sitting right in front of the Chef preparing the seafood/fish plates, we had to try the scallop and the salmon entrees. The scallops were huge and cooked to perfection. The salmon was tasty, too. 

Wanting to try something from the grill, and because Chef Symon is known for his love of pork, the smoked Hampshire chop on creamy polenta was very good. The portion could have easily served two.  

The showstopper of the night was dessert. The 6 a.m. Special was amazing. Brioche French toast with maple-bacon ice cream topped with caramelized apples was the perfect ending.  (I think the plate was licked so nothing was missed!!)

The service was prompt, the Chefs preparing the food were entertaining and the good food make Lola a must try."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and food. Little pricey but you get what you pay for. I had the scallops, they were excellent! My company had the Hangar steak, I'll try that next time, It looked fantastic. All the salads were fresh and creative!"}
{"text":"Went there several years ago when it was a hot place to go.  Great trendy, city, modern atmosphere.  LOUD.  At everyone's recommendations, both online and in person, we ordered the favorite items, most including pork products.  We were both sick in the middle of the night.  The best thing that came out odd our visit was our server telling us about chez Francois in Vermillion, where we go regularly now."}
{"text":"Having been aware of this restaurant - naturally! - and having read Yelp reviews, I can say it did live up to its reputation. Excellent food and service and pleasant environment. Will return on next visit for certain!"}
{"text":"Went here last month with a work group... reserving the table was quick and easy and the atmosphere was quite nice.  

We all had various starters and drinks that were incredibly good.  I had the Cruciferous salad which had a combination of ingredients I would never have thought to mix into a salad but it was very well balanced.  The beef hanger steak was cooked properly and the rosemary fries added a nice herbal touch as a side.  Dessert was a deconstructed smore which was alright.

Overall a very enjoyable experience with one minor annoyance being the drink menu ipads.  For a table of 8 we were given 2 which meant for groups with picky drinkers there was a bit of a wait to even see what was available.  It also didn't help that these ipads seemed to be older and slower models which weighed more and took more time to load the different beverage selection screens.  Sure the iPad allows you to drill down to almost too much detail on the wine origins but perhaps supplementing them with a couple of traditional menus as well would be nice."}
{"text":"My bff and I stopped by for lunch, it was a beautiful sunny day so we sat on the patio. It could not have been a better experience! I had the scallops, yummy!!! My friend had the tomato soup and grilled cheese ( the chicken pillard was sold out, but we came late). It was delicious. What an elevated version of a classic. The service was fantastic!! Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"My foodie girlfriends and I (all from LA), were in Cleveland this past weekend for a wedding.  We kicked off the weekend with dinner at Lola, and we were SO glad that we did.  The decor was great... hip, but not pretentious... The food was AMAZING.... delicious, clean comfort food with a lot of flavor.   We had everything... wine, appetizers, large entrees and desserts.... all so good.  Our server Amanda, was AWESOME.  One of the nicest people we met in Cleveland.  If you have dinner at Lola, ask to be seated in Amanda's section and order whatever she recommends.  You will leave very happy."}
{"text":"We were in Cleveland on business, coming from Los Angeles. We ordered the gnocchi appetizer, which was was tasty but not overwhelmingly great. My husband had the sturgeon and I had the scallops for our entree. Both were very good, and very mild with interesting accompaniments. We also had the Lola fries and mushrooms as a side dish. The fries were seasoned beautifully with rosemary and nice and crispy. The mushrooms were too salty, but very tender. We shared the 6 a.m. special for dessert, which was literally the best thing we ate there. The French toast was fluffy and the maple bacon ice cream had the perfect salty-sweet combination. Here is my issue with Lola: the vibe. It is a pretty restaurant, and our server was nice, but the vibe was so boring. I realize Cleveland is not Los Angeles, and that is not the problem I am describing. I cannot put my finger on it, but it felt that there should have been more of an elegant feel. Maybe it was the group at the next table that was dressed rather sloppy, and constantly standing up to snap a picture of their big night out. Anyway, food and cocktails were prepared well, with a lot of thought."}
{"text":"Food was close to perfection. Pierogi is truly the best appetizer. Their wine selection is great too. Pricey."}
{"text":"I was there with my boss last Friday night for dinner.  The restaurant was located at a very nice blocked off street with a variety of other restaurants around.  Ordered bone marrow and beef cheek pierogi for appetizer.  Pierogi was nothing special, but the bone marrow platter was very tasty and interestingly plated with really interesting ingredients to add on.  For entree, we ordered calves heart and lamb loin.  Calves heart was very tasty and not gamey at all but reminds me of portobello for some reason!  The mild chewiness/bounciness and smooth texture was an experience that won't be forgotten in a very good way!  Lamb loin was good but only comes with 3 small medallion pieces... Quite pricey.  The side dishes came out after we are done with entree... They manager did a good job in service recovery I have to say.  Otherwise would be a 4.5 start :-)"}
{"text":"Only OK....not as good as the hype.

GOOD STUFF:  Very trendy place with trendy customers sitting at the bar and at tables.  Wait staff was very helpful.

BAD STUFF:  Expensive...whoa...expensive.  For that kind of dough in Cleveland you need to expect a lot...and this place doesn't deliver to that high level.  Food was only OK.....nothing special...I tried all of the four appetizers and mains that were served to us and nothing stood out as extraordinary.  Very loud.

PRICE:  Up there with the most expensive places in all of Cleveland...about 150 for two with bottle of wine.

OVERALL:  Not worth the price.  I only went once so may have just been an off night for them or me but I was hoping for more given the buzz on the street about this place.

Plus one star for the well earned good publicity the chef (Simons) has generated for the Cleveland food scene."}
{"text":"Finally got there this past Friday, Feb 24th.  Yup it's that good.  Went there w one other person.  Apps: veal sweetbreads and pork belly.  Entrees: hangar steak w Lola Fries and Berkshire pork chops w creamy polenta.  Everything was excellent.  Fave was the pork belly app, has perfect smoked taste, it was superb.  Second fave, veal sweetbreads.  Thoroughly enjoyed my chops would suggest though that the sauce is a tiny bit sweet.  Hangar steak was very well flavored.  Service was impeccable.  Every time I even started to think I wanted something the server was there.  Had house malbec and it was quite good.   Neither I, nor my companion had room for dessert.  We were just too satisfied.  Sadly we were unable to finish the Lola fries.  Too full.  I spent a lot less here than I spent the week previously in New York at the Russian Tea Room in Manhattan.  The food was significantly better here in C-town.  Great place, great ambiance and great service.  (Cannot understand why someone complained about the service in a recent review, but then I suppose everyone can have an off night.)   I will go back."}
{"text":"This place is good - I'll buy that it's the best Cleveland has to offer - but it's not the best I've ever had.  While the food is solid - the service leaves a lot to be desired - very spotty.  I would say overall North End Market in Hudson is just as delicious.  Both pale in comparison to a high end NYC restaurant.

Also - be specific about the kind of table you want.  The hostess is nightmare to deal with.  I almost walked out - if it wasn't for the GM.

If you don't mine paying for good food with unrefined service - you won't be disappointed.  Will I return?  Probably.  Won't race back though."}
{"text":"After reading great reviews, we made reservations for dinner the night before the NBA Finals (go Cavs!)

It is very dark inside. Weather was good so we chose to eat outside instead. 

I had the lamb and it was PERFECT. My date had the fish and his was great too. Our server was very attentive and mid-dinner a woman came to check on us as well (possibly the manager?). 

I would love to come here again. One appetizer, two entrees and two drinks came out to $130."}
{"text":"To describe what happens to you when you step in Lola is hard.  It is like to walk into another world.  Gone are the worries of the world, gone is the monotony of everyday life.  Walking into the bar of Lola is like waiting in line for a ride at Disney world.  You may not know what is going on behind the curtain, but you know the chef is about to take you on a wonderful adventure.  The glass wine case which serves as a backdrop to the bar begs you to order something in it.  The iPad drink menus are scattered behind the bar waiting for you to peruse the huge menu of pretty much anything you can wish for.  The open kitchen is like the center ring at the circus.  It doesn't matter where you sit, you want to see what is going on in that kitchen.  Will you get a glimpse of Chef Michael Symon?  Who else might you find in the restaurant on that given night.  There is an air of exclusivity to Lola for whatever reason, although reservations are pretty easy to come by.  As Jenn and I waited for our table, our adventure for the evening was just beginning.

We took our seats waited for our server to come over, I decided that I was too sheepish to try and calf's heart that was on the menu.  I had flirted with the idea that eating a calf's heart would be great, and what better person to cook it than Michael Symon.  If it wasn't delicious, it wouldn't be on the menu, I tried to tell myself.  I wasn't afraid to step out on the ledge, but as my wife told me, that is a big step.  I acquiesced to the pork chops, but not before I ordered the beef cheek perogies.

Jenn wasn't sure about them because unlike me, she didn't go out on the ledge at all unless she knows that the fall is about 2 feet.  Beef cheek perogies were out there for her, but something I called safe in my book.  Once they arrived and I took my first bite, and Jenn also took her first bite, I think we calmed down and took that mental sigh.  This was what we were looking for.  Good food, good conversation, and great atmosphere.

We ordered a bottle of wine, what it is I am not sure, but Nicole our server assured us our choice was amazing and that it would go great with both our meals.  Jenn ordered the Rib Eye with roasted bone marrow butter and kale.  I ordered the Pork Chops with BBQ onions and cheesy polenta.  I considered my dish to be rather safe, but cheesy polenta was something I can't just unsee.   I had to have it.  Jenn of course had to get a side of Lola fries because those were the fries we have been missing ever since our favorite Michael Symon restaurant closed down, Bar Symon.

We wound down over the last bit of wine in the bottle and 3 glorious glazed doughnuts and a shot of hot chocolate.  It was a sweet topper to a great meal, and Nicole was probably the most perfect server for our night.  She was attentive without being rude.  She was there when you needed her, invisible when you didn't, but always stopped to make sure our wine glasses were full."}

The appz were good we had the \"famed\" beef cheek pierogi ,im bias and polish my moms dough is much better . The fill is good and robust .
The bone marrow was also well plated and the garnishes were wonderful
The scallop cervice was ok , you would think they would have use some huge 6-8 size ,alas no , it needed just a hint more salt we all agreed since we had the muldone  from the marrow, 
The entrees were good pork shank fall off bone 
Duck perfect med rare 
Special fish red snapper. Not bad but it could have been plated with some type of rice or something 
Desserts were great !

Terry me sue thingy. Awsome the jellied expresso ! 
The home made ice cremes were good.  , its just ice creme to me 
Over all it was a fun experience"}
{"text":"I dined at Lola for lunch and here's what we had:
Spicy tomato bisque
Beef cheek pierogue
Pork schnitzel
Chicken paillard
Egg nog creme brûlée
Maple bacon ice cream

Everything at Lola was 1st rate. The only exception was the brûlée. The nutmeg in it was so overpowering that you couldn't taste the other flavors in the dessert.

The menu choices are expansive even for lunch and the wine selection by the glass was vast even for a wine bar. 

The service was impeccable. I hate to write tis because it makes the place sound cheap, but the value here was exceptional.  I'm recommending this restaurant to all of my friends. It's definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Experienced Lola last night for the first time. The staff and service were excellent finding us a table outside without a reservation. Tried the beef cheek periogi and sturgeon. Both were very good. 

The only criticism I have is that the flatware seems to have been chosen for its aesthetics more than its use. It was actually uncomfortable to hold the knife and fork during dinner. 

I would definitely recommend this place for visitors and locals alike. If you can get past the awkwardness of the silverware you will definitely enjoy the food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We had a great time at this place! Excellent ratings in all of the following categories

Good service - Check! I came with a few girlfriends and my sister and decided since it was an outing for my birthday that I would pick up the tab. The hostess helped me with my sneaky task by taking my credit card information before I sat down. My friends were a little upset that they couldn't pay for dinner, but I guess they can get me back on their birthdays!

Ambiance - Check! As you walk in you see the bar to your left - it has all of their wine stacked up behind a glass enclosure. You can see the manager picking out the wines for the night. It gives you something great to look at if you happen to eat/drink at the bar

Food - Check! They had a great variety of selection even for restaurant week. I had the vegetarian dish that was excellent. Not too much salt and all of the flavors blended nicely. Just the right portion size. My friend got the hanger steak. The steak was the right size, but the rosemary fries while delicious were just too much! It took 4 of us to finish all the fries.

Dessert - Check! They had a very unique version of tiramasu that was nice in presentation as well as taste. 

Drinks - Check! Good offerings of wine at various prices. The mixed drinks are very good. My friend got the Pear martini, but made the mistake of trying to eat the \"picked ginger\". I wish I had a picture of her face as she bit into it!"}
{"text":"Courteous hostess, prompt seating and incredible food. The waiters and bar tenders are first rate. They know the offerings and seem pleased that we were so satisfied. Standout out cocktail was a grapefruit ginger gimlet. And did I mention the food?! Beef cheeks, Foie Gras, pork shanks and the ravioli. Desert! Couldn't fit it all and still wanted more. It's just that good. Thanks Lola and Chef Symon for a great experience."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to eating at Chef Symon's restaurant for a while, so when I had the chance to road trip to Cleveland, there was no question where I would be eating dinner one of the nights. Lola is not only a place where you can experience great food, its fun and lively and the service is impeccable. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted and taken immediately to our table. Our server handed us an Ipad which contained a drink menu. My boyfriend was already impressed. 

Although I cannot recall the name of our server, she was easy to talk to and made great recommendations. We started with the beef cheek pierogies. Upon tasting these delights, I cried a little-no really I cried-ask my boyfriend. These were the most succulent, perfectly crafted little bites of soft dough that just melted in your mouth.

We continued our meal with the charcuterie plate. Whenever I am at a restaurant I always get the charcuterie. This by far blew any other plates out of the water. All the meat was made/cured in-house. My favorites were the smoked salmon and the confit of pork belly. 

Just when I thought this couldn't get any better my entree arrived. Hesitant at first to order the pork chop, our server assured us that it was spectacular. She did not steer me wrong. This pork chop was cooked the way it should always be-kind of had a bbq taste, but was perfectly juicy. The polenta it sat upon was creamy and rich.

For dessert we decided upon the 6 am special-brioche french toast w/ homemade bacon ice cream. Divine. 

Go to Cleveland. Go to Lola. Experience what real, unpretentious food is."}
{"text":"For years, my friend dangled a Michael Symon meal for when I ended up in her neck o' the woods. So call it intrigue or built up expectations for our eventual dinner at Lola. 

The menu seemed  predictable for a swanky establishment. When it came to deciding on an entree, nothing really stuck out. Our server gave us his three recs: chicken, pork, or lamb. Service was pleasant and efficient. We shared the crudo and I decided on the roasted chicken, my friend ordered the scallops. All of our dishes were well-portioned. We could've just gone straight for the entree. Overall, I was expecting more. Was our dinner well-executed? Yes. Would I return? Probably not, though I respect Lola's place in the city's food scene. Perhaps a bit too stuffy and businessy wine-n-dine for a gal like me."}
{"text":"The beef cheek pierogis are phenomenal! I give it 6 stars! 6!You must try it. I could eat it all day, everyday!  I even told the guy next to me at the bar that he should order it and if he didn't like it, I'd eat it and pay for it. Even his snobby ny taste buds liked it! I got some flank steak and it had too much chew for me even though the sauce was good. I have it 2.5 stars. The service was good but I wish the bartender woulda been honest about the steak instead of recommending it. That's why this place didnt get 5 stars."}
{"text":"Food is one of the things that keeps drawing me to Cleveland for weekends away. Having a great experience at Lolita's in the past I picked Lola's for a splurge this time, and I was not disappointed. 

Though there are safe Midwestern dishes (steak) on the menu, my wife and I prefer to eat out of the box a little. The crispy pig ear appetizer was great, with good salt and kick. The duck entree with mushrooms and currants struck the balance between comfort food and sunshine. And their newer lamb sirloin dish was prepared spot on- and super tasty. We finished off with raspberry lavender and grapefruit vanilla sorbets.

Someday, I will splurge again."}
{"text":"Worth it.  Went down on a Tuesday and sat at the bar.  The bartender was very attentive without being overbearing, and made suggestions which were spot on.  It was restaurant week, so I went for that.  Everything was well prepared, and worth the price for sure.  The normal menu looked great as well, and next time I am in Cleveland, I am stopping back and seeing what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"Overall my experience here was good. The food was absolutely phenomenal, but there were a few things that keep me from giving it a 5 out of 5. We went here to celebrate Valentine's Day, and neither of us had been there, so I was really excited. We started with the sausage appetizer. I had planned to look up the name of it online, but it must be a seasonal item or something because I can't find it on any of the online menus. It was dynamite though. Sausage, brussel sprouts and some noodles. So delicious. I got the scallops and my boyfriend got the pork. The scallops in the entree seriously melted in your mouth. The pork chop was also really good. I had a few bites, and it was thick but really tender with a mixture of sauces. We finished with a sampler of the sorbets, which were very refreshing. One was blood orange and one was a rosemary flavor. I can't remember the third one. 

The cons of why I didn't give it 5 stars. 1. The tables were pushed together really closely. I'm not sure if they're always like that, but it felt like we were on a double date with the people to the right and left of us. For how much money you pay to eat there, I dont expect that. And 2. The waitress did not tell us that the entrees didn't come with full sides, and I actually walked away a little hungry. I wish she had told us so we could have split something."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. Overall, not impressed. The restaurant is so loud that you can't even carry on a conversation with the people at your table. My coworker remarked that the bathroom wasn't all that clean. The drink menu on the iPad is annoying and awkward, as there aren't enough for each person to have their own. Plus, do we really need to scroll through three paragraphs waxing poetic about a cocktail that ends up just tasting like generic fruity nonsense? As for the food, it was a mixed bag. The complimentary bread was great. The appetizer of beef cheek pierogi was yummy. The entree- sea scallops- was so incredibly salty as to be almost inedible. The side of brussels sprouts was soggy and bland- literally had no seasoning at all. For dessert, we got the vanilla creme brulee, which was very tasty- glad we got to end the meal on a positive note. Service was good- responsive, if not particularly friendly. But with all the hype, and at this high price point, I expected a far better experience than the one I got."}
{"text":"Lola is my go-to restaurant to bring folks in from out of town to. I've never had anything short of an amazing meal at this place. Cleveland's finest dining for sure. Try sitting at the chef's table overlooking the kitchen for a fun experience. I do this often and the chef's come over and talk to us about the food and suggest things."}
{"text":"Family was in town, and it was high time for a \"wow 'em\" meal.  We made reservations at Lola, and despite the odd day and time (Monday at 8:30), the restaurant was bustling with energy.

Before this outing I was an East 4th Street virgin.  Not sure if the other restaurants will compare to Lola, but I may want to try them.  (By the way, my sister said that E 4th reminded her of Disneyland: \"Like, is this a real street?\"  My thoughts exactly.)

I loved the dark decor and the chandeliers in Lola; even the ceiling looked cool (I trust I'm not the only one who inspects a ceiling while dining).  Everyone there was very professional and greeted us pleasantly.  We had a delicious wine and started off with some pear and beet salads (with hazelnuts - great touch!), the braised Berkshire \"Bacon\" which was mouth-wateringly decadent, and a soup special (Greek lentils with - what else? - bacon.  Smoky and delish.)

We each ordered something different for our main course.  We had the duck, the walleye, the pappardelle, and the smoked berkshire pork chop.  I don't have one negative thing to say about any of it!  The presentation was beautiful, and the way the servers all gathered around us and swiftly set our dishes down (for both appetizers and main course) seemed like a flawlessly choreographed number.  We were very impressed.

Dessert?  Duh.  Although my family each thought they ordered the best one (dark chocolate macaroon, coconut caramel bavarian), I had the clear winner with the peach melba.  It had \"peach granite\" - it's like a more crystallized version of crisp, fresh sorbet - atop vanilla cream, crushed raspberries, and pound cake, all in a chilled martini glass.  Wonderful!  And this is coming from someone who usually wouldn't order a fruity dessert.

Our jaws didn't quite hit the table when we got the bill, but only because we knew to expect that bomb and had been saving up for a nice night out.  But, I guess it's Valu-Time mac and cheese for a while until I can afford another night out at Lola."}
{"text":"My friend and I visited Lola while we were at a conference in Cleveland because we heard it was owned by an Iron Chef. It was wonderful. Our server was very personable and friendly, and made sure that every need we had was taken care of. Our water glasses were never empty, and when my friend (unknowingly) dropped her napkin on the floor, a hostess came and replaced it with a new one. 

I had the sea scallops and they were amazing. Seared on the top, and very tender in the middle. It was like eating butter. We also tried the 6 AM special, and the ice cream really did taste like bacon! The ice cream wasn't really for me, but the french toast was very good. We also had the coconut chocolate bavarian cake, and it was the perfect ending to the meal."}
{"text":"The wine list was very good although not all that it could have been, lacking a bit of uniqueness but still very good.  The food was excellent, it wasn't the best pork belly I've ever had but it was good.  The Hanger steak may have been one of the best steaks I've ever had in my life, and considering that it was a hanger steak is impressive!"}
{"text":"Hidden in a colorful alley next to the Cav's home turf, Lola's is a creative restaurant with delicious food. The ambiance is dark and swanky and their wait staff are attentive, friendly, and most importantly, knowledgeable. 

Appetizers are absolutely appeasing in both the aesthetic and taste buds sense. The chilled lobster was covered in delicious wasabi veggies and avocado. You can literally taste the sea off of this delectable shellfish. Cauliflower soup has cauliflower charred and seared till it lies flat and is covered with a delicious thick and creamy base soup. Be sure to pay attention when it is being served, for they pour the boiling soup over the cauliflower. How fun to watch!

The sturgeon was wrapped in a thin veil of sliced potatoes. The sturgeon was so tender and grilled to perfection that I can feel it all separate piece by piece in between my teeth. In there lied some baby carrots that have been caramelized with a hidden crunch inside. Speaking of caramelizing, the caramelized onions that sparsely decorated the sturgeon was so sweet and grilled into delicious layers of goodness. And we're not done with the potatoes! A thin amount of mashed potatoes is spread below everything. You go from roasted crisp potatoes covering my sturgeon to creamy mashed potatoes. My tongue was being raped by potato textures..and I received an orgasm. 

After our main course we splurged on the desserts. The four desserts that landed in our stomachs were the Sour Cream and Green Apple Panna Cotta, Dark Chocolate Macaroon, a cheese platter, and their \"6 AM Special.\"

-Sour Cream and Green Apple Panna Cotta: The sour cream panna cotta with green apple sorbet amalgamated into each other was absolute perfection. It came with thin, sliced cucumbers and a little bit of toast. This light and airy dessert is perfect to top off with after a heavy dinner. This was my favorite dessert! Hats off to you Michael Symon!

-Dark Chocolate Macaroon: This is absolute, rich intensity. Just one tiny little bite will allow you to immerse into the dark cocoa world. All you dark chocolate lovers, this is your dessert calling for you. 

Cheese platter- Just a simple and traditional cheese plate with thinly sliced granny smith apples and toast. How can you mess it up? Aged cheddar with granny smith apples. Yum.

-\"6 A.M. Special\": maple- bacon ice cream? Say what? Yes. Sugary vanilla ice cream with pieces of fried bacon. The combination of creamy sweetness mixed with sharp saltiness is surprisingly a good twist. Little mini french toasts topped with baked, sweet apples lie aside this wickedly evil ice cream.

It was an explosion of flavors in my mouth the whole entire night. The instability of sweet, intense, bitter, and everything imaginable was experienced in one seating. Thank you Michael Symon. Yes, thank you indeed."}
{"text":"Lola is by far one of the top restaurants in the Cleveland area. It offers a small unique atmoshpere. Perfect for taking that special somone or family out to a nice meal. Not too mention, the food has been terrific everytime along with the service."}
{"text":"The food was good, but just that. Not great and certainly not exceptional. We had the beef cheek perogies, white bean soup, the pork chop, and the halibut. On the plus side, they did have a pretty extensive gluten-free menu. The presentation was nice and the service was friendly, fast and attentive."}
{"text":"Hands down best dining experience I have had in Cleveland. Space is very classy yet warm, open kitchen is nice to see as well. Although our server was not the friendliest, he did the job and the rest of the waitstaff was great. Of the 8 courses we ordered almost everything was outstanding. Potato Pave was the only letdown as it was incredibly small and did not feature caviar as advertised. Pierogis were delicious and portion was much more generous. Beet carpaccio was my favorite version of a beet salad to date. Scallops were amazing, cooked to perfection with the right amount of spice as well. Hangar steak was Also very tasty and a great value with the huge portion of fries. Toffee cake was great as well loved the pears and ice cream on top. No question I will be back for more."}
{"text":"Great lunch options! Twists on classics that aren't too pretentious or far fetched. Good eats"}
{"text":"Pork is of course the better item here. Service was a bit weird and too attentive. Good overall but it could be better."}
{"text":"What an impressive dining experience. I loved everything about this place, from the decor, to the food, the alcohol selection and our server. This was a great place to bring my friend from NYC. This is definitely one of the best restaurants in Cleveland. Thanks for the recommendation Cara, wink. 

Smaller portions, so I chose not to share. I did the ceviche to start. I haven't had ceviche since the last time I was in Vegas, and this was just as delicious. In one word, magnificent. 

For my entree I chose the Alaskan halibut. I have never had halibut before and as a fresh fish lover, it was divine. Cooked perfectly, dressed wonderfully and perfectly appointed with olives and artichokes. I would never think all these items would go together, but Chef Michael Symon is a genius. I did the mushrooms as my side and I ate it all, it was so darn good.

Great wine selection, but I'm no wino so let's talk pear martini. Once again, I trusted my servers suggestion and tried this. The smell of the drink was unbelievably good and I know I'm gonna come back for happy hour craving this martini. Absolutely cannot wait to come back, next time with a reservation."}
{"text":"Lola would hold its own against just about any prominent San Francisco restaurant.  It's that good.  

Perhaps it's not a French Laundry, or a Gary Danko, but it's up there with any other top notch restaurant in the Bay Area.

It was easily the best place I ate in Ohio on my recent trip home, and the dining experience was easily the best fine dining experience I've had in Ohio, having grown up there.

First of all the food is rockin' good perfect.  Our little foursome, three of us transplants from the Old Country with Cleveland roots and 1 of us a San Franciscan, found it hard not to hyperventilate over every dish.

We had been tipped that pork is a specialty of the chef, and the man knows his way around pieces of pig, let me tell you.  There is not a shockingly large array of pork dishes on the menu--it's not a sprawling menyu by any stretch of the imagination--but the items are beautifully chosen to offer up an opportunity for the chef to show he knows how to bring out the beauty in the foods he uses.

Second, the atmosphere is a cut above.  Nice furnishings, a great open kitchen atmosphere, a mix of levels, looks, and a warm but airy feeling inside.

We found the service top notch, and I wouldn't hesitate to take any picky, food-obsessed, over-indulged Yelper from any city to this place for dinner out."}
{"text":"Loved it. A bit high brow for my normal taste but the food and service was great."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try Lola this past weekend. We did not regret that decision! It was so good. I got a cocktail, \"Cleveland is a Plum\" sour, it was pretty good, but pricey for what you get.

The meal starts off with some bread, and we decided on the potato pave for an appetizer. It was delicious! The smoked caviar on top was perfect, even my husband, an avid fish hater, loved the caviar saying that it \"Tastes like bacon\".

 I am a vegetarian, but decided to with the halibut because I am sick of eating a pile of veggies every time I go out (only veggie option was \"Summer Vegetable\" dish). It was the best halibut I have ever had. Seriously, it was cooked perfectly. My husband got the smoked pork chops. He hates bbq sauce, but loved the bbq sauce the pork was served with. He also really liked the polenta and wished he got more of it. The pork looked like it was cooked well and it was a HUGE portion of pork. He also got a side of Lola fries and it was a GIANT portion.

We don't typically go to expensive restaurants (newly weds, not a lot of cash laying around), but we will try to go back to Lola for another special occasion in the future. It was well worth every penny. 

Side note: The hostess was not a pleasant woman. She was sour and rude. Luckily, we only had to deal with her for about 2 minutes"}
{"text":"A-Ok is about right. 

First off, let me start by saying that I absolutely adore Michael Symon.  He is awesome.  I'm always intrigued by his food (for the most part), and I was geeked to visit Lola on our recent trip to Cleveland.  

The atmosphere and location are pretty cool... very upscale, ritzy.  What I didn't care for was the seating towards the back that is sort of shared.  It's one of those long, shared booths on one side, and chairs on the other.  I understand that this is probably a logical set-up to fit the most people in, but I still can't help thinking of Bob Evans when I see this arrangement.  Also, if I'm spending $100+ for a meal, I don't want to hear the table next to me's conversation.  The hostess told us that even though we had a reservation, we had to wait until exactly 9:30 (our reservation time), even though there were quite a few empty tables that weren't filled in that time we waited.  And we were led by the snarky-ish hostess past singular tables and into Bob Evans seating.  Not so happy about that.

So we sit down, and look at the menu even though we already decided we wanted Beef Cheek Pierogies two days before we arrived in Cleveland.  Let me tell you, folks, these Polish pillows of love did not disappoint.  Order them.  I don't care what else you eat that day, ORDER THESE PIEROGIES.  They are that good.  The cheeks... incredibly tender.  The sauce on top... rich and delicious.  I think I could eat these until forever.  The only downside was that it was a little lukewarm, but that seemed to be the theme of the night.

Unfortunately, the entree situation went a little sour.  BF ordered the venison, and I ordered the salmon.  I was really wanting salmon that day for some reason.  I'm picturing a nice hunk of flaky, tender salmon.  What is put in front of me was an overcooked, underseasoned slice of salmon.  I get that this is upscale dining, and I'm accustomed to that.  I was not expecting something heavily seasoned.  But what I was expecting was a well cooked, salt and peppered piece of salmon with the salad/veggies it is served on.  Not only was this salmon wayyy overcooked (it was literally HARD), it was lukewarm! So how long was it sitting out like this? Nobody will ever know.  I feel like a jerk, but for $30, it's going back.  I could get a better cooked piece of salmon at PF Changs.  I reordered the squash/pumpkin stuffed pasta, and it was pretty good.  Rich and creamy, but, again, a little lukewarm.  BFs venison was pretty good, but a little tough, even for a game meat.  

Since I sent back my cold, overcooked salmon, the very apologetic manager came over and let us know he was sorry, and that our desserts were on the house.  Cool.  I was going to order dessert anyway, so bonus, I guess.  I ordered the lavendar lemon dessert (two of my very favorite flavors!) and it was pretty delicious.  I didn't understand the need for the caramel sauce that accompanied it, and I could have used a little more of the meyer lemon sorbet to cut the sometimes soapiness of lavender.  The shortbread cookie and lemon mousse were divine.  Oddly enough, the sorbet was a little soupy by the time it got to me.  Not sure why it wasn't colder? BF got the panna cotta, and I didn't feel it was anything extraordinary, but it was definitely good.  

Also, the coolest thing was the drink menu on a tablet.  What an ingenious idea!  It takes the awkward out of ordering a glass of wine.  The only thing that would make it cooler is if the order went straight to the bar. 

Since I'm a Detroiter, I will try Roast and see what I think of that.  Am I happy I made the trip to Lola? Definitely.  The food itself was great.  The service and expertise of the cooks/chefs left a little to be desired."}
{"text":"I went to Lola for my mother-in-laws birthday and this was actually my first time dining there. 

There were 6 of us so we ordered a nice assortment of appetizers and different dinners and desserts. 

Overall I thought the food was good but I'm not dying to go back. The reason I gave it 4 stars is for one dish and one dish alone - THE BONE MARROW!!! It was AMAZING! I've had different styles of marrow but never have I had deep fried marrow. YUM!

Other appetizers we ordered were the oysters, beef cheek pierogi, and the pork belly. All very tasty as well. I honestly feel like I would go back for appetizers and drinks and just skip the dinner menu (that's how obsessed I was with the marrow).

Dinner orders: Sturgeon, Rib Eye x2, Hanger Steak x2, and Scallops. All cooked very well with good flavors. Ok, I lied I do want to go back to try the cod and duck off the dinner menu. haha! 

The ambiance was nice and the drinks were yummy as well!

I have yet to go to Lolita in Tremont who I hear has a superb marrow as well (not deep fried but cooked in a more traditional style)."}
{"text":"Loved this place a few years ago! Great food. Just when't back, it's still good. But will MS not around... It's not mind blowing like it once was... Still worth it thou"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and decor.  Lousy food.  I had the pasta.  Came to me cold.  I sent it back which I never do.  It came back but just wasn't good.  Glorified Mac n cheese."}
{"text":"Everything truly is better with the pig.  Michael Simon really has created a gem here in Cleveland.  Try the sweetbreads, and do not leave before you've had a chance to try the 6am special and its bacon ice cream."}
{"text":"This was our second time dinning @ Lola's. First I want to say  how easy it was to use the Yelp app to make a reservation. Could not have been easier and we were last minute making our reservation.

The atmosphere was great buzzing with activity our servers were attentive and helpful. Our food was good what we expected. 

We will be back."}
{"text":"We had an amazing meal! The beef cheek pierogi was delicious. The Beef Tongue is AMAZING!!! I had the venison which was again, perfect! We got a side of fried cauliflower. I highly recommend this place!!! So good!"}
{"text":"So, few people probably love Michael Symon as much as I do so it pains me to say it but this was horrible. We've loved Lolita and have followed him in his endeavors supportively but this was really poor. The chickpea soup with lobster couldn't have been saltier or less flavorful - salt does not equal flavor. It was fishy and salty and gross. The cheek pierogi was doughy and the creme fraiche melted immediately leaving a soupy unattractive mess. The one delicious item was the best salad with burrata and prosciutto- we loved it. The entries were perhaps the worst. My husband ordered the hanger steak rare and it was blue. Went back and came back as medium rare and it was still bloody and blue. He tried to eat the outside pieces little tiny slivers of them so as to not send back a second time but he wound up simply not eating at all. It was so disappointing frankly. Oh and our waiter was marginal at best. Forgot the horseradish and never asked if we were ok even though we clearly weren't. Will never go back."}
{"text":"I typically go to Lola for lunchtime with coworkers (I work downtown).  We typically go here when we have small occasion to celebrate (e.g. new employee or birthdays).

I've experience their muffelata and their hanger steak.  They're all pretty great, and the hanger steak is a favorite amongst the lunch crew. Apparently, they make their own catsup too. 

My first time I came, I ordered a soup and salad combo -- for some reason, the salad did not satisfy.  It was like, shredded iceberg with some dressing -- can't say I recommend that."}
{"text":"I went to Lola with coworkers last fall.  I think it's pretty good - in fact, probably one of the 2 best meals I've eaten in Cleveland with 4 visits to the city in the last year.  It's owned by Michael Symon (the famous Food Network chef) and eating at Lola is reminiscent of eating at Emeril's namesake restaurant in New Orleans.  

Michael Symon shows a lot of creativity in the menu.  It's not cheap but it's not the most expensive meal I've had either.  

Best to go either with work (company footing the bill) or during a special date."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here. Fantastic. Beef cheek perogie, and the bone marrow ap was out of this world."}
{"text":"Great food and the people are very pleasant. Thank you for the good service and keep it up guys."}
{"text":"Wow!  I have eaten at many cleveland restaurants in my travel but this is my favorite. I had the waitress recommend the meal always nice when they dont point to the most expensive dish. She recommended the berkshire pork chop. It was the best chop ive eaten and ive eaten at the best restaurants in america. Waitstaff was excellent and everyone was attentive. Even the manager stopped by.  Just a great experience. And under $30 !!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a grapefruit gimlet from their cocktail menu and it wasn't great, just average.  Bar seemed understaffed.  Old crowd.  Good location and that's about it!"}
{"text":"In my 10 years in Cleveland, I have never visited this famous Michael Symon restaurant, so what better time to visit than Restaurant Week? My friend and I decided to give it a try. The first thing I noticed when entering was the lighting and ambience, truly first-class. We were able to get a same-day reservation (granted on a Tuesday evening) even though the place was sufficiently crowded. 

The offering for restaurant week was a Carnivore and Vegetarian tasting menu paired with 3 oz. wine tastings for each course if you so wished (and who are we to turn down a wine pairing?). From the first course to the dessert, everything was phenomenal, 5/5. I chose the Vegetarian tasting menu. The spinach salad was perfectly dressed and light, the roasted cauliflower was delicious (esp. the ras el hanout curry at the bottom), the cavatelli was rich and delicious, and the chocolate prune and rum cake was a decadent end to a fabulous experience. The wine pairings were perfect. I'm no wine connoisseur, but I discovered flavors I've never experienced before. 

If my review hasn't convinced you by now, you should give this place a try."}
{"text":"Could be the best restaurant in the area.

I'm not giving 5 stars because when you pay so much money your expectations naturally rise and while the salad and the dessert where spectacular, with ingredients like fruit and weird fresh herbs which totally surprised you and made dining there a true gastronomic experience, the entrees where just 'extremely really well-prepared'.

If you get my point..."}
{"text":"Our first experience at Lola's! What an amazing evening. The barrel aged vesper (i.e. Bond drink) was so smooth and refined,  the o.m.g. (think orange cosmo) was yummy, and the wine list was extensive. 

Apps: We got 3 and in order of preference.. a ceviche crudo that was out of this world, pork belly and pig ear with watermelon (who knew pig ear was so crispy and delicious?), and the beef cheek perogies. Other reviewers seemed to love the beef cheek but compared to the other 2 apps we ordered it was just ok. 

Entrees: The pork chop was melt in your mouth delicious and the polenta underneath was the same. The hanger steak was perfectly cooked (got medium as recommended, normally I get my steak med-rare) and the pickled topping was the perfect compliment. The Lola fries with rosemary were also delicious. So good even without ketchup! The sturgeon was also good, perfectly cooked, but the meat dishes were amazing. 

Dessert: Highly recommend the 6am special! If you love french toast, maple syrup, and bacon, this is for you. We also got the peanut butter deconstructed candy bar which was yummy but I preferred the 6am!"}
{"text":"While driving from Chicago to Maine, my husband and I decided to spend a night in Cleveland specifically to dine at Lola. Unfortunately, the experience was lackluster at best.

We arrived right on time for our reservation.Two hostesses greeted us at the door without a smile. We were informed that the restaurant was running behind. A slight delay is always disappointing but understandable. My husband and I decided to grab a drink from the bar while waiting for our table. Instead of a menu, we were handed an iPad. I think this ordering system is supposed to seem trendy and unique. It really just felt forced and unnecessary. While we were seated at the bar, the overworked bartender had to stop what she was doing twice to help customers navigate the iPad menu. To her credit, she still served us our drinks quickly and had a great attitude. 

We sat at the bar and sipped our drinks. I checked the time and realized we had been waiting to be seated at our reserved table for 15 minutes. I decided to go up to the hostess stand for an update. The two hostesses barely looked up at me. I was told that my table still wasn't ready but it should be available soon. Neither girl apologized for the wait. I walked back to the bar and we waited. 20 minutes later, one of the hostesses let us know that the table was ready. A 35 minute wait for a table we reserved 8 weeks earlier is a bit excessive, but she didn't offer up any explanation or apology. My wine glass was still half-full. Oddly, she told me I would need to finish it at the bar and meet her at the hostess stand when I was ready. Huh? They let you take a drink from the bar to your table at TGIFriday's. In nicer restaurants, someone will often even bring the drink over to your table for you. But at Lola's, I guess you need to chug it down before you can enter the dining area. I quickly finished my drink and we walked over to the hostess stand. We waited almost an entire minute before they looked up and acknowledged us. One of them decided to do us a huge favor and walk us over to our table. I think Lola's hostess training might be provided by the Kim Kardahsian School of Entitlement. In order to provide friendlier service, Michael Symon should get rid of the hostesses and replace them with a check-in kiosk. At least it'll be programmed to say 'please' and 'thank you'. 

As others have said before, the restaurant is very loud. Diners are packed together as closely as possible. Our server was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. She tried to hand us another iPad wine list, but we just ordered what we were drinking at the bar. We tried the pork belly appetizer. It was really flavorful and we enjoyed it very much. My husband enjoyed his pork chop entree. I ordered the hangar steak. The chef apparently recommends it cooked to medium rare, but I asked for it to be cooked medium. It was still served to me medium rare...barely. It was also oddly chewy. I only ate a couple of bites. The steak was served with a GIANT martini shaker full of fries. I appreciate generous portions, but this was overboard. For someone who appeared on a special highlighting the problematic amounts of food wasted by restaurants, I don't know why Michael Symon would serve a side of this size. I'm sure a lot of martini shakers get returned to the kitchen with at least half of a serving left behind. 

When it came time for dessert, we opted for the 6 AM special. I was intrigued by the maple-bacon ice cream. This sounded like a dessert that would be a one-of-a-kind experience I could only have at Lola. Sadly, this is a dessert I could have recreated in my own home after a night of heavy drinking. I would just need French toast, ice cream, and a container of Baco-s. Maple-bacon ice cream is just maple ice cream topped with a few crumbled bacon pieces. It was a real letdown. 

I've been lucky enough to dine at some great restaurants. Lola isn't one of them. If this restaurant was in a larger city, it would never survive. Cleveland deserves better. I'm not a \"foodie\" or a pretentious snob, but when I spend money on a special dining experience I expect great service and delicious food. Is that too much to ask? Michael Symon seems to think so."}
{"text":"It was a good meal but it could have been great: an almost-there meal. 

The beef cheek pierogen with horseradish creme fraiche were delicious--the meat slow-braised and melting, an unmitigated taste of beef: a very clever take on a very Cleveland dish. Awesome. 

Had the pan-fried Arctic Char with roasted tomato, avocado puree, radish, watercress and lightly-pickled cucumber served with a lemongrass-infused tomato water. Brilliant flavours--refreshing summary sweetness with unctuous creamy avocado and a slight Southeast Asian tang. However the fish, I thought, was a little tough, although our server described it as being cooked \"medium.\" Is should've asked for, uh, \"rare\"? I've never been given that choice before when it came to fish. However, I really think it would have been better served poached so that it would've been yielding instead of a little chewy. 

Dessert was a little disappointing. I had \"The 6am Special\" but there was too much maple syrup, too little bacon in the ice cream and the french toast was a little too soggy. 

I think I'm being a little too harsh on Lola, though, as I can't help but compare the fish entree to Le Bernardin and the dessert to the Fat Duck's famous pain perdu, both of which are ridiculously lofty benchmarks for ANY restaurant. 

Lola is aaaaaaalmost there and I was, on the whole, satisfied with my meal."}
{"text":"This is my second time dining here and this restaurant truly lives up to the hype.  I was there Saturday night for a delicious meal with my family.  We arrived right on time for our reservation, which I made like a month in advance, and we were seated right away.  Based on the yelp reviews I read we started with the beef cheek pierogi.  They were melt in your mouth delicious!  Everyone at our table loved them, the meat was so tender.  We also ordered the foie gras mousse appetizer, I thought it was just ok.  But I'm not a big fan of foie gras, its a little too rich for me.  The rest of the table loved it.  Our entrees consisted of the pork shank, pork chop, hanger steak, cod, and steelhead trout.  Everyone loved their entrees but the ones that truly stood out for me were the pork shank and the hanger steak.  Both were so tender and delicious.  I order the hanger steak medium and it came out perfectly.  And the Lola fries were so addictive no one at the table could stop eating them.  For dessert we ordered the 6am special, a mint mousse, a figgy pudding, and the egg nog creme brulee.  All were amazing, with the exception of the figgy pudding which I thought was just ok, but my favorite was the 6am special.  Not one bite was left.  The service was attentive though not overly so, and all the dishes arrived promptly.  Overall this was a wonderful dining experience and I highly recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Im giving Lola 5 stars because I stepped outside my box and it was delicious!. Started with the gnocchi,  with black truffle and pecorino, very good, but rich. Here is where I step out of my box, I ordered the calves hearts, they were SOOOO good!. They came with a celery root puree, brussel sprouts, and the best salsa verde, I've ever had. In case your wondering calves hearts reminded me of a tender filet. Didnt taste gamey or weird to me. Also had a side of roasted cauliflower, simple but tasty.  Cant wait to go to Lolita in a couple weeks. Would come back here in a heartbeat!."}
{"text":"We walked in with about 5 minutes to go before they closed up lunch service, I expected attitude or excuses from the hostess and got neither!  We were seated immediately and our server was more than pleasant.  Everything we ate was pretty good- nothing that knocked us off our feet though.  

The grilled cheese was less about cheese than we expected.  The coffee was tasty and the dessert was sweet and savory. 

The layout is nice, the dining room was white tablecloth and the kitchen was wide open.  

Nearby parking was $0.25 for 20 minutes.  If you can find street parking without using the MVP 'alley valet' (whom was blocking the alley entirely and obstructing our only legal form of egress), do so."}
{"text":"The best. Rib eye, medium rare cooked perfectly with that polenta. Yep. You can do a lot worse. These guys know how to make food memorable."}
{"text":"I visited a while ago with my girlfriend and her mother. This was our big sendoff dinner right before she left to go back to California and we'd spend all weekend looking forward to it. It didn't disappoint! We had booked a day in advance. 

We were seated as soon as we walked in the door and brought drinks immediately. Someone also brought out bread (and he replenished it often throughout the meal!), followed by our server. I don't often dine in places with such spectacular meals, but the server was incredibly knowledgeable and able to answer all questions about what certain dishes contained, what they tasted like, and how certain things were prepared. I ended up getting the pork chops with polenta - a side I had never had before. It was so good I became obsessed with making the perfect - or at least a decent - polenta but nothing comes close to how good it was here! 

For  dessert I had the lavender meringue and raspberries, which was absolutely delightful. My companions all enjoyed their meal as well (they raved about the bone marrow)."}
{"text":"I didn't have much expectations coming to Cleveland, a ho hum Midwestern town or so I thought.  After 3 very satisfying dinners I came away impressed.  The highlight was definitely Lola, which shouldn't have been too surprising since it sports a 5 star rating from my pal Julie D.  

Even after only one visit I can tell Lola is special. The ambiance was way cool, with dark lighting and stained concrete walls.  Our waitress was knowledgeble, friendly and helpful.  When we asked her for recommendations, she had her favorites and I just went with her advice.  

For starter, I had the beef cheek pierogi, which is tender shredded cheek stuffed in a Polish pastry (kind of like a small empanada).  Given the number of references in reviews, this was a no brainer and it did not disappoint.  

The surprise was the smoked pork chop.  How boring can it get, right?  Well it was the best pork chop I've ever had.  The meat was cooked perfectly medium (pinkish) and the smokey flavor and the sweetness of the bbq onions and the polenta just went so well together.  

From just glancing around the restaurant, there were smiles and laughter and good conversation all around.  For me, there's no better sign that the patrons have been well taken care of and fed like a king!."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Reservations strongly recommended. Every bite is an experience. Pricey, but if exquisite flavor is what you desire, this is the place."}
{"text":"I wasn in Cleveland for work and stayed at the hotel right next to Lola. I had heard of a food called sweetbreads (from an Anthony Bourdain book) and while walking to an irish pub to catch the final 4 I saw sweetbreads on the window meny as an app. I walked in and discovered they had no dress code (I was dressed casually). I ponied up to the bar and ordered sweetbreads and Duvel. As I took my last bite of the dish I confessed to the bar tender that I did not know what sweetbreads are and he informed me that they are the thymus gland of a cow. All I can say is if they can make the thymus gland taste that good, imagine what they could do to the rest of it! It has a cool alabaster bar and is a great place for drinks too if you like to meet people and be seen."}
{"text":"I'm sure it's a bit different now that Michael Symon is an *Iron Chef* but honestly Lola is just a very good restaurant.  The decor and vibe are upscale and modern but not pretentious.  Everyone is friendly enough on the surface and the service is fine but rarely great - however the food on multiple visits has been pretty great.  In terms of appetizers the Beef Cheek Pierogis are a staple as well as a lobster appetizer with different preparations but always lots of lobster meat.  Pork Belly has also been good and one duck entree was a bit heavy on the meat and light on accompaniments such as the sweet potato puree while on a subsequent visit the duck breast with mole' was portioned nicely and really good.  They also have a very nice wine list and stemware including an amazing 2008 Beaux Freres Vineyard Pinot Noir by the glass for \"only\" $22 which is actually a very good deal for this wine (and it's served in a Riedel Oregon Pinot Noir glass).

Lola Bisto is certainly a great restaurant with great food - I definitely plan to go back as often as my budget will allow when I'm in town."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed an amazing dinner at this beautifully decorated restaurant in the heart of Cleveland.  We shared the Lobster Citrus appetizer, we also shared a Kale, Cabbage & Parmesan salad...both dishes were delicious. My husband ordered the Salmon and I ordered the Ribeye with an add-on of Roasted Potatoes and Carmelized Onions...seriously the best dinner I've ever enjoyed.  For dessert we ordered the server recommended \"6 AM,\" brioche french toast w/maple bacon ice cream on a bed of spiced applies (nirvana) and we also ordered the Chocolate Chip dessert, which was good but not as spectacular as the 6 AM.  We highly recommend Lola to anyone visiting Cleveland.  Our expectations were high and Lola exceeded them!  Thank You Lola!!"}
{"text":"FAVORITE and BEST.RESTAURANT.EVER. I have tried a lot of restaurants around town and worldwide and Lola's is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland.. If you're in doubt and don't know were to eat..just think of Lola. Great food, Great atmosphere and Great service.A must try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"I'm not a foodie, I just like to eat. But last night I almost felt like one of those folks who lives to try the restaurants of the all-star chefs. And man-oh-man, did I ever live for this place. It was so good, I want to knock a star off of all my previous restaurant reviews as what I am about to tell you about just cheapens them all. 

First, for full disclosure, I do not willingly watch Iron Chef or the food network. My husband watches Randy Marsh-style or we leave it on for the dogs (let them beg at the 50 inch and see if Rachel Ray caves to their puppy dog eyes). But I do watch, and secretly, Chef Michael Symon is my favorite. So I was pretty happy to be at Lola figuring that even if the food wasn't good I could still rub it in to my foodie friends back home in Boston. 

Well it was beyond good. For starters, I had this gorgeous pork belly dish -- which for all intents and purposes for you squeamish types is pretty much bacon. The pork bellies were nestled in this sweetly seasoned squash puree and decked out in a julienne of ginger, bits of blood orange, cilantro and apple. My bouche was très amusé at first bite of this amuse bouche. 

Then came my main course, a pork chop. But this pork chop went above and beyond the call of duty. It was smoked and grilled, lending a subtle ham-like taste and texture to it. The cheesy polenta the chops sat upon really stood out (not in an overpowering way, but in a 'hells to the yes' way). My very Italian grandmother doesn't even have anything remotely as good in her polenta repertoire. 

There was no way I was going to go without dessert. On the right of the dessert menu, tucked away, was something called the \"6 am special.\" French toast, maple bacon ice cream that the waiter pushed on me in an almost insistent manner. I had to trust him, he'd suggested the pork belly and the pork chop...the man knew his pig products. I have no words. I'll just say this: it was so good that it almost rendered an already outstanding meal completely forgettable. 

If you visit Cleveland, you have to check this place out. If you live in Cleveland eat here quickly, because if I find a way to put this place on a truck and move it to Boston, it's on."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Atmosphere was great. Food and service was amazing. I will be back.  

It was dinner for one that night and I didn't feel alone. The matre'd chatted with me and made me feel very comfortable. 

I had white asparagus soup, beet carpaccio salad, adult s'mores, and they gave me an amazing caramel as a finish"}
{"text":"Reserved a table for 4. Left my number for them to call when something opens up. They told me 45 min. Waited around for hours and never got a call. Waste of time."}
{"text":"Favorite part: butternut squash soup, just what I was craving."}
{"text":"There is no way around it -- you're going to leave here feeling disgusted at yourself for consuming 2,700 calories in a single meal. In my case, the meal consisted of a trio of terror split among my equally revolting family, who had no problem ordering baby cow heart (Kali Ma!) and lamb loin entrees. See you all in hell.

We added some type of foie gras (pump that liver, pump that liver!) appetizer to the mix alongside a pork pierogi made with creme fraiche -- so, it's no wonder I'm scheduled to have my left foot removed next week. Side note: The pork pierogi was so amazing my sister and I tried to banish our mother to the car while the rest of us finished our meal. \"This is what you get for cooking us such inferior pierogi for all of these years,\" we screamed in unison. \"Go. Get.\" We stopped short of dumping water on her head. 

My dad -- who is trying to be more healthy and get back down to a size 36 waist (laughs) --ordered a salad and mushrooms. His agitation grew with each bite of his unimpressive mixed greens, and decided to harness his annoyance toward the noise coming from the restaurant's open kitchen. 

\"What? I can't hear you. It's so damn loud in here,\" he'd say in the middle of each conversation before offering up a defeated sigh."}
{"text":"Beautifully coffered ceilings, James Taylor playing in the background, soft lighting, tastefully decorated and exquisite granite sets the tone for an unforgettable dining experience.

I opted to eat at the bar.  David, bartender extraordinaire, greeted me early and made a delicious cosmopolitan - the best I have ever had.  He was easy to talk with and made me feel like I was a regular.  I felt so comfortable and enjoyed watching him effortlessly make gorgeous cocktails.  He wiped and cleaned every glass before serving and garnished his masterpieces with the perfectly shaped garnish.

I ordered the tuna tartare without anchovies.  To die for....a little heat, but the capers added an interesting salty compliment to the freshest tuna I've ever had.  I loved the flavors going on in that dish.

I was not particularly hungry, but had to order the Caesar Salad...it was amazing.

This restaurant is great for dates, family, special occasions, dinner after work,and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My first meal here was just okay, but every subsequent dinner has been excellent. The vibe and decor are elegant but subdued, and the service matches. Most importantly, the food is excellent and inventive without being overwhelmingly out there. The bone marrow appetizer is a must. My only wish would be that I could enjoy Cleveland's most regarded restauranteur more regularly like I did when Lolita was also around!"}
{"text":"Shocker, Michael Symon even does lunch near perfection.  Open for lunch with a limited menu; Lola still delivers on taste, service, and atmosphere.  Seems to be a local favorite for the business power lunch; yet comfortable for the casual lunch diner.  

Even a simple Turkey Sandwich or Trout Salad is prepared to perfection.

I cannot recommend anything Symon does enough, he takes pride in his work and he loves serving Cleveland the highest quality of everything food related."}
{"text":"Fantastic! The atmosphere of Lola's is that of a top end restaurant that would charge you and arm and a leg for a slice of bread. But the prices at Lola are down to earth.
What really makes it for me is the quality of the food. This places knows how to serve high quality, fresh food. 
The servers and staff are helpful in suggesting items and in how to prepare them, such as meats to be cooked a certain way/temp.
If you grab a lunch there, the Spicey tomato soup is excellent and I would suggest getting a cup regardless of what your meal will be. I would also suggest a grilled Cheese. These are excellent.
Dinner is a real treat and you have great choices of fresh ingredients.
I would recommend Lola to anyone. Definately worth the visit. Take a day and visit the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and cap that off by a visit to Lola. That will make you want to visit Cleveland again and again.
You should get reservations to help ensure a table though. It can be busy on a weekend."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Went for Restaurant Week.  Tried the mixed greens with spiced pears and blue cheese.  Nice, simple and flavorful.  Then got the hangar steak.  Big portion...10oz.  Perfectly grilled and seasoned.  Whatever type of shaved and pickled red onion compote that sat atop the steak was a nice spicy contrast to the steak..thoughtfully done!  And of course who can resist the best French fries on the planet?  The Lola fries never disappoint.  Scallops and cauliflower soup were delicService was professional, food was top"}
{"text":"What an amazing dining experience we had at chef's table last night! I can't say enough about how wonderful Jake and the crew were. I am so glad they suggested the bone marrow. Out of this world crispy on the outside, meat butter fabulousness inside. And everyone who interacted with us suggested their fav combo of the accoutrements. Then the perfection of the sturgeon with chorizo, fennel and apples. Another spot on recommendation from my new friends in the kitchen. My friends scallops were also perfect. The service here was OUTSTANDING. It was prime time- 8pm Saturday - and everyone was wonderful. Our waitress was friendly, available and attentive. Everyone took time to treat us like we were valued visitors. The general manager stopped by to introduce himself and make sure we had what we needed.
We felt welcomed and pampered in addition to being treated to an absolute feast of flavors! Pure Love!"}
{"text":"Good food, fairly good service and nice wine/cocktail selection. It's a nice restaurant that's fairly pricey but a very nice atmosphere. Limited menu and has VERY LIMITED vegetarian selection. Their only veg entree is a small plate of vegetables. Honestly the atmosphere is better than the food but I'm not a huge fan of meat. The smores dessert was ama"}
{"text":"Part of what makes a restaurant great is a sense of responsibility and graciousness among members of its staff.  Our recent experience with one receptionist on New Year's Eve was a far cry from gracious.  After making a special trip to Cleveland just to go to Lola's we called ahead to ask what the best parking was.  The response was curt and minimally informative but we managed to locate the valet parking and pay $10 to leave our car.  When we reached the door to the restaurant we were barred by a locked door and a sign explaining that Lola's was closed for lunch while it made dinner preparations.  Just inside the door, we saw a woman sitting at the reception desk.  When we knocked and asked her to have a word with us, we explained that we had just called to ask about parking.  Sure enough, it was she who we had spoken to.  When we asked why there had been no mention of the closure, she shrugged and muttered a simple \"sorry\".

A moment's thought would lead one to ponder why during a period of closure a customer might be asking about parking.  Could it be that parking was planned in the very near future?  Is it unreasonable to expect an employee taking a call to offer that information when the closure was during a time that the restaurant is normally open?

That omission caused us to waste $10 on parking and left us with limited options when we could have easily selected another location if she had just made the effort to inform us.  If that's the kind of disinterested service we can expect from Lola's, we'll find other places to dine in the future."}
{"text":"Lola's is one of our favorite places in Cleveland and, given the large number of options in this foodie town, that's saying a lot. I've been here on a number of occasions for business lunches and dinners and my wife and I had a very special dinner here about a year ago. The rich smells, laid-back but classy ambiance and fantastic food is what keeps this place hopping and worth coming back to."}
{"text":"Came here on the recommendation of a friend who had eaten here recently. I am extremely grateful for that recommendation. We were seated for a late dinner around 730. And in a great area, we had no problem finding a place for drinks while we waited (society lounge).  We started with the crudo which was delicious, a charcuterie plate that was equally good and the beef cheek pierogi that were life changing.  I will dream of these pierogi (is pierogi plural? IDK). Anyway, the entree list was short but elegant and we settled on the scallops (X2), the poached halibut and the cioppino.  I would recommend the poached halibut or scallops though the cioppino was pretty good.  I'm sure now that nothing at Chef Symon's restaurant would disappoint.  The wine list was also great and we thought had some very reasonable options for excellent wine.  Can't wait to come back on my next trip to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner and mainly stuck to sharing a number of appetizers. The cooking is definitely meat-centric, so keep that in mind when deciding to go. The standout was by far the bone marrow appetizer - I will always order marrow if it's on a menu, and this is the best preparation I've ever had. The pierogi was also a standout item on the menu. We had one of the salads, which was good but didn't blow us away. I would suggest sticking to meat-based dishes since that appears to be what Lola does best."}
{"text":"Okay, so whenever I am in a town where there is a fancy schmancy restaurant, particularly one owned by a famous chef personality, I get very leery about the hype. But, at the same time, I have a very hard time staying away. I have to try it. I have to see for myself, particularly if I actually like the chef who's name is attached. Michael Symon calls his cooking \"meat-centric\". And since I am the exact opposite of a vegetarian, I dig his POV.

I arrived at Lola at about 7:15 on a Tuesday and was lucky enough to snag the last available bar seat. 

I ordered a glass of the Beaux Freres, a Pinot Noir I had never heard of, but that sounded pretty delicious based upon the wine description available on the drink menu, which was on an iPad. Was I impressed by the iPad? No. Was I impressed by the fact that I was able to access notes and descriptions on the body, flavors, and tannins of each of the wines on the menu? Yes. For the record the Beaux Freres although the priciest of red wines served in the glass, was one of the best Pinots I've had in a long time. Not too heavy, not too light. Perfectly spicy, slightly fruity, a little earthy, and so smooth. Worth the $22.00/ glass price tag for sure. For the record, I think the pours were very generous as well.

I ordered the Beef Cheek Pierogis to start. It was raining out and they were perfect comfort food to start with, and were gone in about 5 minutes. Tender, flavorful, perfectly shredded meat in a lovely pierogi dough and topped with wild mushrooms, a sort of gravy, and creme fraiche. I don't normally like mushrooms but with the tanginess of the creme fraiche they were perfect. By the end of the dish I found myself mopping up all of the wonderful gravy, creme fraiche mixture left on my plate. If in the comfort of my own home, I would have licked it clean.

For an entree, I chose the Pork Chop, with BBQ onions and cheesy polenta. There were a couple of things I LOVED about this entree:

1) I have gone to too many high end restaurants with large price tags and European portions. Midwestern girls like to eat. And not a couple of bites. So I appreciate that this is not one of those aforementioned places. The portion was big. Not enormous, or wasteful. Just big enough that I was full when I was done eating it. The pork was already cut off the bone, super juicy, perfectly cooked, with just enough fat. 

2) The cheesy polenta. I WOULD BATHE in that polenta if given the opportunity. Its THAT good. 

3) The flavor combo of the cheese and the BBQ and the smoke, was so satisfying.

After this, I probably should have stopped. BUT, how could I possibly skip desert when the menu included their version of an ice cream sandwich. 2 macaron ice cream sandwiches, with pistachio ice cream and rosewater and raspberry sauce. The idea of the flavors reminded me of too many things I ate at Laduree in Paris. So I had to. The macarons were a little tough; I had a hard time breaking them with my spoon. So I just picked them up and ate them like an actual ice cream sandwich. A little messier that way, but all in all, it was still absolutely fantastic. 

The bartender was delightful. Friendly, funny, helpful, always there to clear my empty plate, refill my glass, take my next order. At one point we had a discussion about how much we both love frito pies, and joked about how he should start making them behind the bar. Which, I mean, I appreciate so much. It makes the place so much more real, and warm, and unpretentious. 

All in all, this place is great. The food is fantastic, the service was lovely, the atmosphere is classy without being over-the-top or uncomfortable. I will absolutely be back the next time I am in Cleveland."}
{"text":"My boyfriend made us a reservation for Sunday of Labor Day weekend. Luckily he did because it is a very popular place. After dining there I know why! The space itself has very cool design and vibe. It's very nice, but not over the top fancy. 

The service was great. They were very friendly and prompt, refolded napkins when people left the table, and I never had to fill my own wine glass (that may seem snobby but I feel that is important when spending a decent amount of money on one bottle of wine!).

The food was just as I expected from the reviews I read before dining. Very good! I had the smoked pork chop (apparently a signature dish) which was so tasty and rich. The entrees were a very generous size, so you shouldn't leave the restaurant hungry. 

My boyfriend had the hanger steak which was perfectly done (for me) and had some very tasty herb fries with it. The one thing I will note, as it seems to be a trend around east coast fine dining establishments, is that they seem to be undercooking steaks a bit from the temp called. My boyfriend ordered medium rare but really likes medium *gasp*, the steak came out rare, which was perfect for me to fully enjoy having a bit of his dinner, but not so perfect for him. It's very dark in there though, so it didn't really bother him much as he couldn't see how rare it was ;-)

Next time I am in Cleveland I am looking forward to trying Chef Symon's restaurant next door \"Mabel's BBQ\"."}
{"text":"had a very good dinner with my Aunt during the summer. Heard so much about Michael Symon's restaurant and it lived up to the hype. We sat outside on the patio on E. 4th Street - it was nice, but a little noisy. Food and drinks were great and i'd definitely go back and recommend Lola to anyone visiting Cleveland."}
{"text":"Lola's was my first choice of eateries when planning meals on our trip to Cleveland. 

The decor is beautiful. Love the open kitchen, as it really adds to the ambiance. They have a killer Argentinian Malbec on the menu. We were sat promptly at reservation time. 

We started with the beef cheek ravioli. Amazing!!  One of the most delicious things I've ever tasted. I ordered the salmon with pea purée and potatoes. The salmon was cooked perfectly. Unfortunately the rest of the dish was lacking for me. Not much taste to the  purée or anything else on the plate. 

I order the Lola s'more for dessert. It was tasty. If I go back I would probably get the bread pudding. 

The waiter was okay. Not too friendly, but it didn't really bother us. Overall it was a pretty average experience. I guess I hoped for a little more."}
{"text":"Delicious. Beef cheek pierogi for apps is a must. Make sure you order 2. Scallops were excellent, about 6 scallops. Potatoes with caramelized onions as a side was soooo good and the French fries were amazing. Excellent service great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Lola lived up to the hype! The food and service were amazing. I tried things that were a little out of my comfort zone and was not disappointed. 

Perfect anniversary dinner!"}
{"text":"The halibut was cooked to perfection with a wonderful sauce to go with it.

The lamb was also quite delicious.

By far though, our favorite plate was the bone marrow appetizer - would come back just for this

The gnocchi was unimpressive and just your average gnocchi

We also got the sticky toffee pudding for dessert --- another thing I would come back for. Absolutely delicious. One of the best desserts I have ever had.

Certainly worth the price for this meal."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best restaurants in Cleveland. Great food, service and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! We might have had the best table in the house with a nice big booth along the wall.  The menu was pretty small, but everything we ordered was delicious.  The only complaint we had was that our mahi tuna was automatically fully cooked where we expected it to be on the rare side.  The portions were sort of small, but after having appetizers, bread, main course, and desert, we definitely left satisfied.  We ended up spending a couple hundred on dinner and drinks for two, but were overall very happy with our experience."}
{"text":"A formal ambience, with rich food. There is an option to add bacon to almost everything ..including the ice-cream!
Good drinks. A little on the pricey side. 
To me its a great place for business lunch/dinner. Not a place I would necessarily go back to again and again."}
{"text":"What kind of restaurant or town for that matter, closes on July 4th?  We came into Cleveland, dying to try some Top Chef restaurants, and found all of them closed on 4th Street, the \"go to\" place in Cleveland.  Michael Symon, Cleveland, something is wrong when on a holiday, tourists and others find your restaurants closed!

Coming from NYC, where restaurants, etc. are open 24/7, it is unfathomable for restaurants to be closed on a major holiday.  Cleveland, if you want to be a contender, you need to rethink your city and what it has to offer.  Disappointed in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Just like the great lakes - Superior Service, Superior Food, Superior Ambiance - if you did a review of my hometown, Boston - you'd insert your pun too!

I was so happy to dine at an Iron Chef's restaurant and will come here again when I'm back in Cleveland.

Conveniently located around other restaurants and bars - Lola is a very dimly light restaurant with my one of my favorite assets, an open kitchen.

Our server was excellent - recommending dishes and very attentive to our needs.  I think the best part was ordering our drinks using an iPad and submitting it!  So cool!

I had the trout fillet in which the sauce brought out it's salty goodness.  My co-worker had the pork chop which was tender and sweet.  We ended the night with melt in your mouth donuts.  They were really small but every bite was packed with strawberry glaze or anise bite.  Nice touch with the hot chocolate.

I recommend this place for client dinners, birthdays and a romantic dinner.  Average city prices ($30-35) for entrees."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner here before a game one night. Joseph was our server and he was probably one of the best servers we have ever had in Cleveland. He was informative about the menu without being overwhelming.  He helped us decide on our menu choices since it was our first time and everything sounded delicious. We had the pirogies, flank steak, and the peppercorn crusted steak ( can't remember the cut ), fries and the Brussels sprouts.  Everything was delicious and too notch.  We both had drinks from the bar which we enjoyed!  We had the s'mores dessert which was delicious!!!!!! We will 100% go back. They have a great staff, atmosphere and menu! If you haven't been I would put it on your list, it will not disappoint!! ( my drink was a grapefruit drink - amazing !! )"}
{"text":"From the moment we walked up to Lola, we really loved it.  The interior is dim, but there's a great energy.  The open kitchen is bustling.  The bar, very cool, with a wall of horizontal wine bottles.  
We had drinks (which were easy to order from the touch screen, complete with photos and descriptions).  I had the grapefruit/ginger gimlet. Very refreshing and tart.  My husband's Manhattan was perfect.  We had the beef cheek perogies and they were delectable.  The beet salad was beautiful and delicious.  The soup of the day, a black lentl with bacon and lobster was perfectly seasoned and served piping hot...as it should be.  We had the pig's ears and my husband wasn't a fan.  He thought they were a bit chewy, but hey, they're pigs ears!!!  I loved the flavor and didn't mind the chewiness.  Dip was great.  We also split an entree of duck over spaetzle.  It was was excellent.  We finished the meal with the 6 AM French Toast.  I asked our server and she said it had been on the menu \"from the very beginning\". I was deciding between that and the chocolate sesame, which also sounded SO good.  We loved the 6 AM with the bacon/maple ice cream and caramelized apples.  A delightful way to end the meal.   Lola is a fabulous place to dine.  Just a great meal.  What else can you say?"}
{"text":"My girlfriend picked this restaurant for our first date together, and, I must say, I'm so glad she did. Her strip loin steak was delicious, albeit slightly overcooked, but still flavorful and complimented perfectly by the wine recommended to us by our waiter (who was also a delight, quite honestly-- so fun and still so professional). My beef hangar steak was literally perfect, and the Lola fries were so good, even my girlfriend - a self-proclaimed ketchup enthusiast - loved them and helped me finish them. Tl;dr, Lola is a lovely restaurant with delicious food and a cool, elegant atmosphere, and I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"This was my first time in Cleveland and I heard that experiencing the Michael Symon restaurant was a must. My boyfriend and I walked in for an early dinner around 5pm, Saturday, and we were able to be seated immediately. 

Service: the service is perfect here. This deserves 5 stars and more. Our waitress was attentive and informative. Checked up on us at the perfect intervals and our glasses were never empty.

Drinks: I ordered a normal Moscow mule. (No copper cups though). Tasted great! Boyfriend got a Heineken, can't go wrong there.

Food: I'll give 4 stars.

We ordered the beef cheek pierogi bc it was a \"must\". Texture was great, nice and crispy on outside and tender on the inside. I just wasn't a huge fan of the sauce or maybe I was expecting the taste to be completely different and amazing from the reviews I read about it.

Hangar steak: I ordered this one. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The meat is very tender and is topped with a pickled garnish and garlic. It was a very tasty combination. I wish there were more garnish for the large portion for more of that crunch texture. I'm definitely not a slow eater, but within 10 minutes or so, each piece of steak I ate had become cold. The hangar steak came with skinny fries and they were so good! 

Strip steak: my boyfriend ordered this. The presentation was fabulous and cooked perfectly. The exterior of the steak had a really nice crust from the sear, it was great texture. Unfortunately, it was a bit difficult to eat as the meat was kind of tough and chewy. We had to cut small pieces to eat it.

6am special: we ordered this for dessert. This was probably the best thing we ordered. The French toast was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The ice cream had a strong maple, smoky bacon taste! I typically don't like bacon, but the pairing of the toast, ice cream, and apples, were really yummy.

Good experience overall. I guess the food was just not what I was expecting so I'll have to try other stuff next time!"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying I have eaten at Lola twice before, both times were probably 8.5 overall rating on my scale.  That's a pretty darn good rating coming from me.  I have eaten at fine restaurants from NYC to San Fran,  the big easy, Boston, Austin, La and most places north and south.   

Tonight was an embarrassment to fine dining.  We had a party of 10 and dinner at 9:30 on Friday so the deck was stacked against us.

2 chicken, 1 lamb, 2 strip, 4 salmon. 1halibut, 
And 1 Cippino 

Apps were bone marrow, beef cheek perogies, and a couple orders of summary squash soup.

5 Lola fries a couple asparagus orders.

We had a couple 3 bottles of wine.  

So we are talking one hefty bill.  

Nothing would rate above a 6 except the perogies. The Cippino was like cambells soup with some mussels and a piece of last week's sausage thrown in.  The steaks were dry and tasteless, the salmon could have been from any grocery stores prepared section and the lamb tasted like hmmmmm still can't figure that out.  Tell me why would anyone deep fry bone marrow. If you were going to wouldn't you say that on the menu. 

Well Chef Simon, I can say you lost me as a customer with this meal.  I felt like we got robbed when we handed over the 1500 plus for that meal that was memorable for all the wrong reasons.  Oh wait I forgot, the bread was quite good.  

For the record the service was a 6.75 at best.

Hope your proud of that slop.."}
{"text":"Great place for a nice date or a special work dinner. Liked the decor and ambiance a lot- a little swanky but not cheesy. 

Really liked the interactive wine list on a tablet. We got a Pinot Noir for only 42 that was really really good. 

Shared a tomato salad, shrimp appetizer and clam bake entree. Salad was very impressive. Fantastic flavors and beautifully composed. Shrimp seemed much more simple but super tasty. Clam bake was less impressive. It was good but not better than something I could make at home. 

Definitely recommend. Unless you are a vegetarian. There wasn't a single veg or even pescetarian entree. The claim bake included pork, which I don't eat but my friend does so I ate around it."}
{"text":"Very hip-elegant atmosphere. It's got kind of a \"you're not cool or rich enough to be here\" feeling, but the staff is very friendly, so that helped soften it a bit. 
The food is quality, even if it is A bit overpriced. The best thing we had were the beef cheek pierogis. 
My only critique of the food is that it was VERY salty. I could barely taste the meats and veggies on my plate on account of the over-flavoring from other directions.
If this restaurant were anywhere other than in the city, it would be surrounded by deer mistaking it for a salt lick.
Dessert and coffee were fantastic. Not oversized or overdone. Just right."}
{"text":"My wife called Friday night around 5pm to see if we could possibly get a table..thank you to whoever answered the phone.  She managed to get us the chef's table at 9pm...best table in the restaurant in my opinion.

I had the bone marrow..my favorite accompaniment was the sea salt and caramelized onions with the picked shallots...

My wife had the lentil soup and the pappardelle with chantrelles, peas, and parmesan...she loved every bit of it.

We finished with the peach melba...perfect light dessert with cool, soft, and crunchy textures.

Lola is casual fine dining at it's best."}
{"text":"Lola Bistro , Michael D. Symon's flagship restaurant is in the hip East 4th street area of Cleveland in the Gateway District and is walking distance from Public Square, the Jack Casino, the Q( arena) and Progressive Field.  I went expecting greatness and wasn't let down.   We only had time for 2 courses - Appetizer and Dinner but those were ample and flavorful.  
Our first app was a Burrata dish with baby beets, walnuts, vanilla , apple chips and cider.  A rush of contrasting flavors acted well with the smoothness of the Cheese.  Symon knows how to combine ingredients for perfection.   

Our second app, was a Crab bake.  Simple yet flavorful. King crab, chiles, cream corn and old bay.    

My dining partner struggled between the lamb shank with tzaziki sauce and the Sea Scallops.   He chose the scallops which need to be done perfectly and they were perfectly done with corn, pork belly and peperonata.   

I really wanted the Smoked Pork Chop with polenta , chiles and BBQ onions but I was fresh off pork chops the night before.    I chose the black peppercorn Strip Loin served like a pork loin it was beautiful with crispy potatoes, tarragon , chervil and hollandaise.  I substituted the pickle sauce which was spicy and had peppers , Dijon and a wonderful acidity.  

This restaurant deserves the recognition it has always gotten.  
When in Cleveland this is a must visit.  
2 thumbs up.    https://www.lolabistro.com/"}
{"text":"Took colleagues here for dinner and was disappointed. Wine list was great, but it stopped there.  Food was so so for all the hype.  Love B Spot, I think I will stay with that Symon restaurant next time"}
{"text":"\"She walked up to me and she asked me to dance. I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola, L-O-L-A...\"
But there's NOTHING Kinky about Lola on 4th Street in Cleveland!  I was there with a group of 8 and everyone was impressed with the food!  We had a good mix from the menu, appetizers and entres, and it all registered high on the taste-bud-ometer.   When our waitress told us the French fries were fried in lard, we knew it was all about gustation!   Personally, I had the pork chop, which our waitress claimed was a house specialty.  I believe it.  The portion was as large as the taste.  And save room for desert, because the \"6am\" is french toast with bacon ice cream.  I know what you're thinking, but don't knock it until you try it -  it's a taste sensation.  If I'm lucky I will have an opportunity to eat here again. Oh, and did I mention they have a spectacular wine offering?  Your waiter will bring you an iPad on which you may peruse the list.  Get here quickly."}
{"text":"Delicious and fast.  Environment is warm, friendly and casual.  
Try street parking, if you turn on 4th it dead ends and you have to valet for $8.
I had the beef cheek pierogi and pork belly.  It was enough for lunch.  They do have shirts for about $20 and signed cook book for $35, you just have to ask."}
{"text":"Looking for a cute date night with a great wine list? Lola is for you! 

My boyfriend surprised me with reservations (which I recommend making) for my birthday. The entree menu is very unique, but I was able to find a happy middle with the Roasted Chicken. Little to my surprise, the meal had great flavors and left me with leftovers. I can be picky - and I absolutely loved it. And as mentioned above, they have a great wine list (and desert too!) 

The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. We had reservations at 9 p.m. on a Friday, and we had no problem at all!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come to this place for a special occasion but never worked out.  Instead I came here for lunch with my sister 2 days after Thanksgiving.  We had the pork belly for an appetizer, she had the steak for entree, and I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup for entree.  We both got the red and white wines of the day.  

Service was pretty good, but it did take a little too long for our waiter to come to us to ask for the check at the end of the meal; but that was a minor inconvenience, as most of the lunch, our waiter was on point and attentive to making sure if we needed anything.

I'll definitely come back to this place....but maybe for a more special occasion."}
{"text":"Yeah, we heard all the hype, but it's worth the hype. The food was wonderful and everybody should get the cauliflower with pine nuts because it's salty and sweet and a little crunchy. But it was the customer service that really blew us away. Our server, busboy, and the sommelier really went above and beyond for us. We did make a reservation -- about a week ahead, which I recommend - and we got a nice seat with a view of the kitchen. Fav dessert is the 6 am Special. And yes, we did thoroughly enjoy the beef cheek pierogis. 
We would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I realize that it has been a while and some of us would like to see the decor freshened, but MS has his well-oiled machine working smoothly. The service, wine list and food are simply top tier."}
{"text":"Sometimes the wait staff acts elitist and act like you should be able to read their mind. But the food is very good and I have never left hungry."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best meals I have ever had. From the ambience to the wine list to the service to the food I was extremely impressed despite some other not so favorable reviews.
At 6:00 I sat right away at the bar and was instantly greeted by a friendly bartender with drink menu in hand.
I ordered the green salad and the hanger steak with a side of roasted potatoes and onions. 
My salad never arrived but my steak came out very quickly, when I mentioned I had never received my salad the bartender was very apologetic and mentioned it was her mistake and completely forgot, she instantly offered to correct the mistake but the steak smelt too good I did not want to delay.
The hanger steak lived up to the hype and then some. I have eaten a lot of steaks in my life, and hanger steak is not normally at the top of my list but this was one of the best steaks I have ever had. It was cooked perfectly and the flavor with the pickled addition was perfect.
Then the roasted potatoes with onions. Wow. Out of this world. It honestly sounds so simple, but had such an impressive flavor.
When I received my check I realized the bartender had taken my wine off the check as an apology for the missed salad. An unnecessary gesture but one that speaks volumes for her level of customer service.
The service, food, and overall experience definitely receive 5 stars. A must visit next time you are in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I had never been to Lola for dinner because I'm a cheapskate.  I know, tsk tsk, but last night The Wife and I were celebrating our 10th dating anniversary so we decided to splurge a little bit and finally check out Lola at night.  We booked a table on Open Tables noting that we were celebrating our 10th Anniversary.  I've booked reservations in the past at other restaurants telling them the same thing.

When we arrived, they brought us to a nice corner booth with a great view of the bar and wine cellar.  Even though it was meant for 4, they gave it to us and made specific attention to wish us \"Happy Anniversary!\".  It was really classy of them.  We felt like we were big shots, which we totally are not.

Appetizer: Beef cheek Pierogi.  Delish.  Loved the savory sauce and the delicious meat filling.

Entrees: Clam bake: sooooo good scallops.  Probably the best ones I've ever had.  Wish it was bigger.  The broth at the bottom was so good to soak up.  Smoked Pork chop: they kindly split the portion in two so the Wife and I wouldn't have to fight for it.  Really good chop, cooked perfectly and seasoned well.  Loved the rich polenta that came with it.  I think the chop was a better value at $29.

Dessert: they surprised us with a \"Happy Anniversary\" cupcake dessert with little gluten free chocolate cupcakes (best gluten free dessert I've ever had) with little sparklers in it.  Really cool- meant a lot to us.

We got the 6 AM special after this and the french toast was amazing.  The ice cream might have been a little sweet for our taste but the tartness of the apples complemented it perfectly.  An awesome way to end an awesome meal.

We'll be back to this place- I'm so proud that it is here in Cleveland.  The wait staff were class acts.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"***Michael Symon's Lola serves high quality food that feels fresh and contemporary; while I would not put it up there with some of the great LA, SF or Chicago restaurants, I think it is a very strong restaurant for its area***

Lola is Symon's flagship restaurant in Cleveland.  It sits right in Downtown Cleveland.  The restaurant has a lively bar and the dining room fills up quickly (even on a weeknight).  The atmosphere is nice though I prefer a less dark dining room.  Still, I like the vibe that the bustling open kitchen creates and the bar is really nicely done--very high end look with wine bottles attractively displayed.

Symon's cuisine is upscale rustic.  It is not quite gastropub fare; it is more like fine dining fare with less artsy plating and a mix of premium but also less expensive ingredients (like beef cheek and hanger steak).

The fine dining but still robust and approachable food did remind me a little of Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill.  I've been to Mesa Grill and I've enjoyed it.  The food there does seem to be on autopilot though; the dishes they serve and the presentations feel like the restaurant has found its groove and is just coasting now.

Lola feels much more of the moment.  There is definitely a lot of signature dishes, but there also seems to be enough use of seasonal ingredients throughout the menu to keep the food feeling fresh (the presentations feel more organic and not overly precise like Mesa Grill).

The bread at Lola was standard stuff.  Even though the crust was actually good and chewy, the center was really soft (kind of like the bread you would get from a grocery store bakery) - 2 stars.

The starters were good though.  The crispy sweetbreads were nicely cooked.  I prefer bigger sweetbreads and less breading, but I think they did a good job achieving a crispy outside and a juicy and meaty inside.  I really liked the garnishes with the sweetbreads.  The cauliflower puree was great--very smooth and with a noticeable cauliflower flavor but not bitter or bland like a lot of cauliflower purees.

I also liked the crunchy pine nuts as well as the tart green apple and sweet raisins (4 stars).

The beef cheek pierogi were also good.  The beef cheek filling was flavorful, moist and meaty.  The pierogi had a thick outside pasta shell that was more like an empanada than ravioli.  It was thick and kind of like pastry crust (which was interesting).

The garnishes were great.  I liked the rich pan jus as well as the very noticeable but not too strong horseradish crème fraiche.  The wild mushrooms were also very good - 4 stars.

For my entrée, I opted for the scallops though I did regret not trying their pork chop with polenta.  The scallops were still good.  They had a great crust and were very moist and soft.  There was a little unevenness with the seasoning.  The two center scallops were perfectly seasoned while the one on the left had a little too much salt while the one on the left was touched with too much lemon.

Like the sweetbreads, the garnishes were great.  They did a lot with asparagus here.  They had sautéed green asparagus as well as ribbons of white asparagus and creamy and light white asparagus puree (really good).  There was good freshness provided by pea tendrils and fava beans.  There was also a nice smoky and meaty flavor from bacon (4 stars).

For dessert, I went with their brioche French toast, which was served with maple bacon ice cream and caramelized apples.  The French toast was great.  They added a great batter to the French toast, which gave it a more defined crispy crust than most French toast.  It also had a moist and flavorful center.

I really liked the caramelized apples.  They used green apple and the tart apple kept the dessert from being too sweet.  The maple bacon ice cream was very creamy and smooth.  It was lightly sweet and there was a good amount of chewy bacon (the maple flavor was not that noticeable though) - 4 stars.

There was also a complimentary almond macaroon cookie, which had great almond and coconut flavors.

Service by Meghan was very good.  She was personable and professional.  She was also knowledgeable about the menu and attentive.  The food came out at a good and consistent pace between all courses.

Prices were about what you would expect but still on the high side with most of the entrees in the high $20s.

I really enjoyed Lola and it was significantly above the other restaurants I tried in Cleveland.  If it was in LA, I think I would still say it was a good to very good restaurant though maybe not my favorite restaurant.  Still, I think it is a very strong restaurant for the Cleveland area.  While I haven't been to many restaurants in Cleveland, I think if you were only going to one Cleveland restaurant, Lola would have to be very high on your list.

Because Lola is located in Downtown Cleveland, nearby parking is very expensive (there are several lots and structures nearby)."}
{"text":"I initially sat at the bar, waiting for my reservation to open up (15 minutes later than my 8:15 PM reservation). I was greeted and served a drink immediately by Dave.
I decided to eat at the bar once my reservation came up.
After some helpful suggestions from the bartender, I ordered beef cheek pirogies and the roasted pork main. I was told the pork and hangar steak were the most popular dishes. 
My appetizer was served promptly. 

The beef cheek center was tender and flavorful and the pirogies were seared and browned slightly on each side, but not overcooked. 
The pork was a bit bland and served medium, a bit tough. Pork was served on a bed of creamed corn was sweet and creamy, to balance the savoriness of the main. 
The bread served with the meal was crusty outside and soft inside. However, it was cold and clearly starting to go stale by the end of the day. I would expect better attention to detail from an Iron Chef restaurant.

Dave the bartender was excellent--friendly and fast.
The hostesses were a bit lackluster in enthusiasm, and did not put out a great vibe to start out the meal. 

Overall, the meal was satisfying (3.5 stars)
Service was adequate (5 stars for bartender, 2 stars for hostesses)
Depending on your expectations, this is a hit or miss. I expected a bit more, given the chef's pedigree and overall yelp rating."}
{"text":"Pig ear salad??? What??? AHHHHHH-Mazing!!!!  I never order a steak out.... because I honestly think I can get them anywhere.... and frankly I can generally cook it better...  The server told me to try the hanger steak and so I did.... just fantastic.... it was like butter and full of flavor... I could not have asked for a better prepared steak. I also had the peanut butter pretzel desert which was also fantastic.

The ambiance is dark and somewhat trendy romantic, which was probably a little awkward for a business dinner, but get past that and its a fantastic meal.

Do not leave Cleveland without visiting this place... Super enjoyable."}
{"text":"What a fantastic meal and sophisticated ambiance accompanying it.  Our server (Rick) was especially helpful in choosing fitting dishes as well.   

We began with an appetizer of beef cheek perogis.  I had never had cheek meat, which was prepared to be silky smooth.  For entrees, we had pork shank and hanger steak.  The pork shank had been braised for 6 hours, letting the meat delicately fall off the bone.  The hanger steak was tender and had a sauce that blended with the meat in an extraordinary way.  In fact all the sauces and decorative foods had flavors that combined to really excite our taste buds.  To finish the night, we had a chocolate macaroon.  It was good, but certainly was overshadowed by the entrees and appetizer.

With tax and tip, our meal for 2 worked out to $93.  Next time I'm in Cleveland, I'll definitely make an effort to visit Lola again."}
{"text":"This was our \"splurge\" meal in Cleveland (About $400 for 4 people).

It was fairly easy to get a reservation on a Tuesday within a week.

Maybe I am just spoiled by the wealth of everything in SF - food-wise.

The offerings were good, all farm fresh, but I can get as good, if not better here in San Francisco.

My husband and I split the pork chop (our waitress said it was the best one I she had ever had, it was good, but NOT the best one I have ever had).

We ordered all but one of the side dishes for the table and they threw in the 5th one on the house (so that was nice).

For dessert we ordered the mint cake to split - it was tiny, and not super minty or super chocolaty.

The bathrooms were very pretty. Glad I went, but would rather try the BBQ place next door - we had tried to get in the night before, but the wait was 45 mins."}
{"text":"I was in town on business. After a long meeting, I really wanted to sit and relax (alone) and enjoy a delicious meal. Lola did not disappoint. I was really pleased that they were willing and able to seat me at a table by myself rather than asking me to sit at the bar. It was a beautiful night, and I sat outside, enjoyed some live music and people watching. I asked the server for a recommendation - the \"Clam Bake\" was it, and it was AWESOME. I'm picky about scallops and these were prepared perfectly. I ordered a side of Lola Fries and finished with their Lola S'mores dessert. I was very full when I left, but well worth it!"}
{"text":"So many complaints about this over priced place. I had high expectations for a Michael Symon restaurant and  was really looking forward to our dinner at Lola. Unfortunately it was one big let down.

For starters, our table was nice but one side was a booth. There was a giant slash in the seat and it was \"patched\" in clear packing tape. You'd think for a place that's an easy $100 a head, they could afford to take the time and effort to fix their seating. 

Service was by no means great or even good. The person who poured our waters sloshed it all over the place and on one glass spilled it everywhere but never said anything or came back with a napkin or towel to clean it up or dry it off the menu. Just turned around and left. It was bizarre. Our waiter didn't seem to know much and couldn't make recommendations, never mentioned that dinners didn't come with any sides or recommend a side to us when we placed our orders. Service was also incredibly slow.

For the food. We started off with bone marrow and a charcuterie plate. Charcuterie plate had no cheese and most was taken up with fried pork rinds. I didn't eat anything off of it so I can't say if it was good or not. The bone marrow was soooo greasy. They take marrow, bread  it, then fry it. It comes out in weird fried clumps. I've only seen marrow served in the bone. This seemed an odd way to prepare it by adding more grease to an already greasy dish. The marrow combined with the over oiled grilled bread just made for a huge grease fest. I ordered the ribeye for dinner. That's all I got, just a huge slab of red meat. Again, the waiter could have recommended a vegetable side and I'd gladly have ordered one had it been pointed out to me. My steak was cooked perfectly but incredibly greasy. I couldn't eat the majority of it. All my friends and coworkers can gauge either my health or the quality of my food if I ever leave steak uneaten. For the most part, that never happens. Here however, I couldn't bring myself to keep eating my dinner purely because of how greasy the meat was. Another person at our table ordered scallops and ended up leaving his dinner uneaten too. He said the scallops were \"gritty\" and overall it just wasn't very good. None of us were impressed with our meals and for a $700 dinner, we should have at least found the food good enough to finish. 

I think this is another case of a chef banking on his celebrity status and too many over hyped reviews by people who want to like it because they want to like whatever Michael Symon is dishing out."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try a Michael Symon restaurant for a while. Lola's is tucked away in a neat, trendy part of downtown Cleveland. Overall the place had a good vibe with decent prices for the quality of the food. 

I can't say that anything there blew me away. Tried the flank steak, scallops, and pork chops. All three were above average. Dessert was really good and worth it if you have room. 
 
Would have to say Lola is a must if you're in Cleveland looking for good atmosphere and food."}
{"text":"Best dining experience in Cleveland!  Trendy East 4th location.  Love the iPads for ordering from extensive wine list.  Amazing food combinations.  The short ribs were amazing."}
{"text":"I was very underwhelmed.  For as a big of chef as Michael Symon is I feel like you should be blown away.   

There are 2 dishes I recommend the beef cheek perogies and the 6 am special.  Those   2 items never leave the menu.  

As for as the atmosphere it has a nice ambiance and is somewhat intimate."}
{"text":"The ambiance was excellent. The beef pierogi was the highlight of my meal. It was flavorful and just the right size of an appetizer to share with another person. Waitress was good and wine selection the best I've seen in a long time."}
{"text":"We walked from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, 43 degrees and heavy winds, but it was worth it.
I had the soup of the day (curried parsnip), and a medium rare Lola burger.  I'm not sure what seasoning was on the fries, but WOW!  Great flavor.
I was slightly underdressed in my opinion, but the staff was friendly and beyond courteous.  Service was prompt, our server never let my water glass get empty.
Prices were beyond reasonable.  I want to go back!"}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for an interview and I had dinner with a group of people the night before. This was also my first time eating at a Michael Symon restaurant.

Appetizers: Crispy Pig Ears
Entree: Smoked Hampshire Pork Chop
Dessert: Sticky Toffee Pudding
Wine: Hypothesis, Napa County

I remember there was another appetizer... I think it was Carpaccio but I can't remember! This was the first time I ever had fried pig ears. Pig ears are common in the Taiwanese-Chinese delis but eaten cold and sliced. Everyone at the table got different entrees and loved what they got. I was debating between the pork chop and scallops but got the pork instead. The polenta was really good and I really liked the horseradish sauce that accompanied the smokiness of the chop. 

The ambiance of the restaurant is amazing. I loved the look of the wine rack at first side of the restaurant!"}
{"text":"if you want extremely trendy, wine list on an ipad, and look like you hang with the jones.  Go here.  Personally I am done with Lola and enjoy wearing jeans, t-shirt, flip flops and still getting a $100 bottle of wine.  Its just to \"nose up\" for me anymore.  This is the place where one would say Cleveland folks acting like they are from Hollywood or something special.  That said, the service, food, and romantic feel is spot on."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place -- I promise!  I went here as a part of restaurant week for dinner with two girlfriends.  It was $30/person.  I chose the Heirloom Lettuce Salad (Good, but your typical salad), Beef Hanger Steak (possibly the tastiest steak I've ever had), and the Napolean for dessert (eh...just eh.).  The service was great and I enjoyed the ambiance but I can't imagine paying regular prices for dinner.  I'm glad I experienced it, but I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"I go here usually for birthdays for my wife and I as well as other events. We always sit at the chefs table and the experience is always exceptional. Great wine list and the food is genuinely enjoyable. I had the lamb last time I was there and I could taste that the meat was grass-fed and of great quality. I would highly recommend Lola's for special events or for someone visiting downtown looking for a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"Amazing! Been here several times- the hanger steak and Lola fries are amazing. As is the pork chop dish. The true standouts are the beef cheek periogie and the bone marrow appetizers. So unique and keep me going back! Have also had the scallops and pork belly app, but the other dishes are the stars! Service is always fantastic. Our first visit we sat at the bar and the bartender expertly guided our meal!"}
{"text":"Came here with my brother and sister-in-law when I was in Cleveland a few weeks ago. Some good, some bad, definitely not the best meal I've ever had.

Great:
- Berkshire Braised Bacon appetizer: omg so good. Caramelized, crispy around the edges, melt-in-your-mouth tender meat and fat. It definitely tastes a bit Asian inspired, with the sweetness.
- 6AM Special dessert: I'm not a huge fan of bacon in my sweets, but the maple bacon ice cream was amazing. Not too sweet, and with smoky, chewy little chunks of bacon in it. Paired with all the other elements of this dessert, it was a great mix of flavors and textures, and I liked the playful aspect of the dessert and its presentation.
- Lola fries: delicous, thin fries tossed with rosemary. Our waitress told us they're fried in pork fat. Makes you wonder why McDonald's ever stopped frying in lard. Mmmm pork fat.

OK:
- Berkshire pork chops: Good flavor, but not as tender as they could be. I asked for them medium well, since I'm scared of pork not fully cooked (I was actually a little surprised that I was even asked how I wanted them cooked), and they were just a bit dry. The accompanying cheese polenta was decent, but comes in way behind the amazing cheesy grits I had once in Vegas.
- Lamb chops: My brother ordered the lamb; it came with two pieces. I had a bite of the first piece, and it was perfect - tender and flavorful, but he said the second piece was full of pieces of gristle. 
- Halibut: Sister-in-law's order. It was decently tender, but rather lacking in flavor.
- Mint Chocolate Chip dessert: Flavor was good, but overall it felt too dense. It was missing a light element to counter the denseness of the chocolate fudge. While I was eating it, I kept wishing the mousse was an ice cream instead.

Bad:
- Service was SOOO. SLOW. Dinner took almost 2 hours, because our entrees took nearly an hour to come out. Our waitress was decently attentive, and apologized for the wait, but after she said \"I'm sorry, it'll be out in just another few minutes\", it took about another 15.
- Ambiance: while the decor is nice, it was ridiculously loud inside. I think this was partially due to the cavernous ceiling height. It was hard to hear across the table, which is much too loud for a nice restaurant, IMO."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant.  Visiting from NYC and heard about Lola's and Michael Symon
What a great experience.  The beef cheek pierogi were amazing.  We were there for lunch so had sandwiches.  The fried bologna was simply delicious in every way. I am hoping when I go back to Cleveland I can try this again.  
Others in my party all enjoyed their food as well.  
Great location right downtown, reasonably priced, attentive service.  All around a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I wish they had more stars to give this place. While it does tend to run on the higher side price wise, you get more than what you pay for here. I honestly can say this place could bring peace on earth if everybody ate here. There is no way you could leave unhappy. Well unless you hate to be happy and full from a wonderful experience. P.s. Get the beef cheek pierogi if it's still available. It will change your life. It might even cure cancer. It is honestly that good."}
{"text":"We went to Lolas to celebrate our friend turning 30, and had a great time.  The scene is minimalistic, but a bit on the boring side, yet the service and food made up for it.  I had the Rib eye which was enormous and delicious.  It came with fries that were seasoned with salt and rosemary, I had never had anything like them, I don't especially like fries, but I could eat alot of these.  For dessert I had the 6am, which was french toast coved with bacon ice cream, sounds weird?  It was perfect and I'll try to repeat this recipe at home.  Our server was friendsly attentive, and made great suggestions.  The restaurant was quite pricey, $130. dinner for two, but I would go back for another milestone celebration.  Happy B-day Ted!"}
{"text":"So unfortunate.

I liked everything about the Lola except for the food. The restaurant has a great vibe that makes you want to treat all your best girlfriends to dinner and even exceptionally friendly staff; however, it fails to deliver when it comes to the food. 

The scallops that I ordered were so salty that I almost sent them back to the kitchen even though it's not a practice that I normally condone. As others had also mentioned, the bread was nothing special either. 

Overall, so lackluster that I couldn't even bring myself to eat dessert."}
{"text":"Noteworthy because the chef here won Iron Chef recently, the food here is the best Cleveland has to offer.  Of special note are the rosemary-tinged fries, which don't sound gourmet but brother, they are tasty.  Also, you may find it a little odd paying $12 for a bacon appetizer... But I asked, \"Hey, how often do I get to pay $12 for bacon?\" and chalked it up to Pulp Fiction's \"Ever had a $5 milkshake?\"

As it turned out, my table mates kept trying to steal my bacon.  Then they ordered another bacon appetizer just to have some of their own.  This is a foodie's dream.  

This is top-notch all the way 'round.  It's pricey, but I don't regret going here for a second."}
{"text":"The food was just ok. I had the pork chop. I wouldn't say it was outstanding. The chop was very fatty and and the fat wasn't rendered at all. The cocktails (I had tropical sangria) was great. The service was very good."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. Service was excellent menu options were great and the wine selection was abundant. Had the braised lamb on the recommendation of the server and it could not have been better. Fell right off the bone and the homemade sauce it was on was amazing!"}
{"text":"It's been so long since I was here, I forgot how good it was.

For starters, the chef's table is not worth it.  Unlike Greenhouse and Crop Bistro, the chefs at Lola do not interact with you at all.  Just sit at a table and enjoy conversation with your companions.

The Food:

Pig Ear Salad: Awesome dish, but I'd rather just be served the pig ear!  Just gimmie the best part straight up!

Charcuterie Plate- Five stars, as always.  No one does Charcuterie like Symon.  It's chock-full of cured meats and pickled veggies.  No cheese.

Foie Gras- It's delicious.  Get over your moral reservations and just try it.  It will melt in your mouth and excite your tastebuds.  The BF says it tastes like duck butter.

Gnocchi- I wasn't impressed with this dish, but I also wasn't the person who ordered it!  She LOVED it.  The gnocchi were very light and delicate, the way they should be.

Sturgeon- The sauce made the dish.  The fish wasn't spectacular, although it was cooked perfectly.

Venison- Cooked perfectly.  Again, Symon knows what he's doing when it comes to meat.  I couldn't have asked for a better venison dish.  Not a star dish, but it's still awesome.

Calf's Heart- For the love of god, you HAVE to get this dish (once again, throw those morals out the window).  One of the most tender, flavorful cuts of meat I've ever had the pleasure to sample.  If you're worried about how it will look, you can rest assured that it just looks like any other cut of beef.

I may have had a very immoral dinner tonight, but hell tastes delicious."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to eat in Cleveland.  Went for my birthday last night and as always, it was phenomenal.  I'm not sure what's better, the service or the food.  The shaved vegetable crudo is always spectacular along with the prime rib for two.  And of course the Lola fries are always a must!  Can't say enough great things about this restaurant."}
{"text":"Quite an experience I must say.  The meal was quite delectable.  The pomegranate martini was well worth the money I spent for it, similar in price to many of what the NYC bars charge for a signature martini.  The appetizers of raw oysters were not as quite to par as the rest of the meal.  The Prime Rib was beyond perfection with succulent juices just oozing from the each piece of beef as you cut with a knife.  The shoestring french fries were to die for, crispy and seasoned just right- MUST EAT.  The meal ended off perfected with maple bacon ice cream.  The ice cream combined the right amount of savoriness and sweetness.  A calorie bust for sure, but well worth it.  The only down side is that service is slow no matter what time you go.  On average we spend about 60.00-80.00 per person when we go, so expect to shell out."}
{"text":"Told a friend of mine about how great the pig ear appetizer was, so we decided to stop by the bar just for an app and drink.   We ordered our drinks and the lauded pig ear app and was surprised at how terrible it looked. When we got it, I was so embarrassed because I went on and on about how amazing it was when I had it the first time. This looked like a plate of old cooked bacon/jerky.  I didn't have to taste it to know that it wasn't ok. We ate it anyway and luckily found some tasty morsels but overall not great.   Another (minor) issue I have are the heavy iPad drink menus. Call me old fashioned, but they aren't necessary. A good ole printed drink menu is still classy.   Could've gave 1 star, but the service here saved the whole experience and bumped it to 2 stars.  Despite this disappointment, I will try this place again because of my great first experience"}
{"text":"This was my second time in two weeks visiting this restraint and I had a blast. My first time was on V-day and I absolutely loved the lobster salad appetizer, it has roasted hazelnuts in it, yum! I got scallops for an entree and they were okay but not better than the lobster salad. My second visit I got the roasted vegetable salad and I must say it was one of the most elegant plates I have ever seen. The beets, watermelon radishes and feta/yogurt/pine nut puree was to die for!!! Again, the entree, trout dish, was not as good as the appetizer."}
{"text":"Came here on a early Saturday night (5:30 p.m.) and sat at the bar for dinner. Read a lot of good reviews so I was excited to try it out. 

I had the:
- Moscule Mule cocktail ($12) - my favorite drink as usual.
- Scallops as entree ($33) - came with 4 slices of scallop. WOW this was amazing, I savored every bite. You must try this :)
- \"6 am special\" as dessert ($10) - this was highly recommended on Yelp, but I thought it was so-so. It may just not be my kind of dessert....

Overall it's definitely an exceptional restaurant (albeit a bit pricey) and it was a great dining experience. It's right in the center of the lively East 4th restaurant street, so the ambiance is fantastic."}
{"text":"went there this past friday night.  sat at the bar waiting for a friend to get off work and had a few (6) whiskey sours.  ordered the Beef Cheek Pierogi with wild mushrooms, horseradish and crème fraiche.  unbelievable.  great drinks.  great food.  great service.  great atmosphere.  nice place to hangout and grab a few drinks."}
{"text":"I went with a group of 7 ladies.  We arrived on time and our table was waiting, the restaurant was lovely, and our server was fine.  However, of the 7 of us, not a single person thought the food was great.  It was \"good\", and the ingredients were fresh, nothing was under or over cooked, it's just that it was completely underwhelming.  We did appetizers, salads, dinner, and desserts, and not a single dish that anyone had was fantastic.  There are lots of places to try, and at this price point it's not worth another chance."}
{"text":"What an amazing food experience! The food was so good I wish I can have it everyday. Ordered the Sturgeon entree and the soup of the day and it was beyond amazing."}
{"text":"We made a stop in Cleveland almost solely for the purpose of eating at Lola.  It was the first night of a long road trip, and this particular day was one of the longest.  We were pleasantly surprised with Cleveland as a whole and will be eager to come back. Eager to return not just for Lola, but the whole city.

The only thing pulling the rating down a star was the service.  We had reservations on the Monday night we were there, but we still had to wait a bit for a table.  Given what I've read in other reviews, and how we were so highly encouraged to visit the bar, I wonder if it was a ploy to get us to buy a drink or two.  The hostess was meh overall, but friendly enough I guess.  I really didn't like the bartender at all.  She just did not make me feel welcome.  She also was behind the biggest complaint I have of the night.  We weren't allowed to move our tab from the bar over to our table when we asked.  While this is an issue with the restaurant as a whole, she also handled it poorly.  She didn't really tell us that this wasn't allowed here, she kind of just looked at us like we were crazy for thinking it was a possibility.

Once we left the bar, I was pretty happy with everything else.  The service was decent, she was friendly and enjoyable to interact with.  The food was pretty much fantastic all around.  There was one shining star that blocked out just about everything else from the night from my memory.  Beef Cheek Pierogies.  I doubt I would ever go back here and not order these.  Every.  Time.  Please note that I hate the whole period after each word to add emphasis thing, but it was that important."}
{"text":"I have no problem being a player hater but I can't do it with Lola, this restaurant always lives up to its reputation as the best in Cleveland and it did so again last Saturday when we were there.
I also have no problem writing long reviews but really there's not much more to be said that every Yelper doesn't already know. 
Atmosphere and wait staff -- Oozing with more class than we deserve
Drinks -- An encompassing wine list and creative cocktails done by bartenders who take pride in their work.
Food -- Every entree is a medley of harmonized flavors and textures perfectly prepared but yet they will still pale in comparison to the beef cheek pierogi appetizer ($12).
'Nuff said."}
{"text":"Killed it! Four of us ordered the lobster, the shrimp, the bone marrow, and crudo apps and all were amazing, but the shrimp was the best. The bone marrow--or was it just butter?--was way better than I could've imagined. We split the beet and the mixed greens salads. And the mixed greens with the blue cheese was mmmmm so good! For dinner we had sturgeon, scallops, salmon, and the pasta. The best were the scallops and the sturgeon and actually, the side of mushrooms. I am sold. Lola, killing it in CLE."}
{"text":"Visited Lola before a Cavs game and had a great time.  We started with cocktails at the bar while we waited for the rest of our group.  They have an iPad menu for drinks and the bartender helps us make our picks.

We started with the charcuterie platter that was plenty for 4 to share along with an order of the pierogies.  The platter was delicious with the exception of a duck sausage that should have been peeled before it was made into a slider.  Oddly, they served 3 of these small sliders when there were 4 of us at the table.  

Two of us had the scallops that were wonderful, other orders were duck and the pork chop along with a side of brussels sprouts.  All were nicely cooked and very good.

No desserts this time as we had to get to the game but the menu looked tasty too."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. Starting from the location and the atmosphere, throu the amazing cocktails, topping it with the sublime food.
We came because our best friend from UK was in town and he actually made the reservation: he had already been here but my husband and I had never tried it before.
We had bay scallops, foos gras bratwrust, polenta, mushroom orecchiette and pork shank. Everything was delicious, fresh made and with elegant pairings od spices and herbs. 
We also decided to go for cocktails instead of wines: perfect! The old fashioned was the best I've ever had. 
We were all fulfilled by the tasty food, but we left some room for the desserts and we are glad we did: perfect size, extremely tasty, not heavy at all. We tried the almon financier, the peanut crunch and the malt chocolate verrine. 
We will definitely be back, and we'll also come just to sit at the bar and enjoy the cocktails.
Perfect for a romantic encounter as well as a sophisticated dinner in good company.
To complete, the staff is very professional and knowledgeable, actentive but not annoing."}
{"text":"Excellent taste, presentation and atmosphere. Terrific for a special occasion or a date night. The 6 AM Special dessert is a must try."}
{"text":"Went here on an anniversary dinner with my girlfriend. The vibe is decently casual (the staff wear nice jeans). The service is great as well. 
The food overall is pretty good for the expensive price. The most memorable part of the dinner was the bone marrow appetizer. Absolutely try this! It was one of the most delicious foods that I have had in quite some time. It was an experience you don't want to miss."}
{"text":"When going to Lola one expects a fine dining experience, however for an \"Iron Chef's\" higher level restaurant and caliber of cuisine should be higher.  I like Lolita better."}
{"text":"Hmmm, let me say that I had a better experience here than I did in the Greenhouse Tavern. Service was better, prices were the same as at the Greenhouse Tavern and the sizes were more manageable. In the Greenhouse Tavern I felt like I was being totally ripped off, here less so. I expected the place to be pricey, I was hoping it was accompanied by great service and flavorful food and I was not disappointed!! I ordered their Crudo and Root Vegetable salad. Their Crudo was a raw tuna which was lacking a bit of flavor, but when I added lemon and ground pepper it was outstanding. The root vegetable salad should have been called \"beet root salad\" because there were no other root vegetables offered on the plate....seriously....they were lucky I like beet roots

After having \"all\" of their healthy meals I decided to check their dessert menu and I chose \" Tiramisu \" ....OMFG...oh boy it looked weird at first, but bloody hell it was SO delicious!!!

I definitely recommend this place if you are willing to spend few extra bucks... Its not a value place, its a premium place! But the experience is worth the extra bucks!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Lola's last night for my daughters birthday. We had five dinners and they were all cold . Duck was very tuff. Service was great and atmosphere was wonderful but would not go back."}
{"text":"Made a reservation six weeks before we got there only to be put in a really uncomfortable table -- maybe the worst in the joint.  We asked for a table on the patio instead--and got it along with the warning that we could only order off of the appetizers, drinks, and dessert menu. Hey, that's fine. If you don't want my money.  

Anyway, appetizers were fine. We did the beef cheek perogis.  As with the food at Lolita, they were underseasoned and there was no salt to be had on the table. 

In all, two drinks and two appetizers cost us as much as two appetizers, two meals, and a side dish at Lolita."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving Lola three stars is because my husband's Porkchop was amazing, the service was impeccable, and they treated us like royalty on our anniversary. We started with the beef cheek pierogies which is a signature item but we were not impressed at all. What we make at home is far superior. I then ordered the hanger steak, which is another signature item, but they served the meat extremely rare when I ordered it medium. The server was extremely apologetic and immediately brought it back to the kitchen which I so appreciated, but even when it returned it was still pretty rare. Thankfully my husband and I switched meals so I got to enjoy his pork chops (which was fantastic) and he reluctantly eat my beef. The fries the beef was serve with were delicious but needed a sauce to accompany it. We also ordered a side of mushrooms which were very bland, and again, when I make at home is better. I'm glad we went to experience Lola but I wasn't blown away, and likely won't return."}
{"text":"First time at Lola, first time in Cleveland, actually. Although the place has been extensively reviewed, I thought I would add a couple of items. Had an 8:30 reservation so the place was hoppin', but not uncomfortably so. Was seated pretty quickly - the bar surface was gorgeous - looked like a backlit quartz. Nicely visible wine selection behind the bar in a glass enclosure. Saw a couple of selections of Opus and I think a First Growth or so. 

Lucked out with a banquette, which made us feel a bit like Judge Judy as it was elevated above the main dining floor. Oh, an observation about the wine service. Looks like they encouraged decanting, which is definitely sexy, but the selections on the tables I saw didn't merit decanting. Didn't see a single bottle that would be throwing sediment, so I guess that's just a showmanship thing. 

We had a bunch of appetizers as I get a good feel for the shop with a number of plates. The pork chop was simply epic. Probably the best I have ever had. Moist and just lightly smoked. Wonderful. The perogies were as advertised in other reviews. Yummy - my companion thought they should have been a bit more al dente. Also had the crispy pigs ears; having lived in Asia, they were not \"gross\" to me but I can see they can be a bit off-putting for the meat and potato crowd. Fries were nothing to write home about. The duck fat fries at Hot Doug's in Chicago are much better.

Now for the one part that made us go \"hmmmm\". The marrow plate. Marrow was extracted from the bone and prolly crisped up in the salamander, or maybe fried. BUT, the server did not explain the wide variety of accompaniments and how to construct a bite. That was disappointing. For all the fanfare, I think it would be a challenge to a novice who had never tried the stuff before. I love marrow, but I was baffled with the lack of explanation. Coulda used more toast and perhaps a variety of bread as well. 

Had the sesame ganache thingie for dessert. Yawn. All in all, though, a great dining experience and a delight to see in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Very few menu options for entrees.  Better dessert options.  Had the Key Lime concoction - which was fantastic.  Great blend of flavours that complement the lime (Taste of mangoes and vanilla macaroon)."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to come here to celebrate my mother in laws 51st birthday. I was super excited about this place and could not wait to try the awesome food. 

Overall, I would rate this place a 4.5. Here's my breakdown:
Food 4.5/5
Atmosphere 4/5

The only thing that really bothered me was a the lack of space for a fine dining restaurant. There was definitely some tables that were against the wall and it looked like customers had a difficult time walking around.

Now the food, let me tell you.. it was very tasty. I definitely enjoyed what I ordered. The lobster entree was my favorite and will be ordering it again the next time I am in down. The butter sauce on the side was delicious and complimented the dish very well. The bay scallop appetizer was a very interesting dish, the oxtails went surprisingly well with the scallops and each spoonful was filled with lots of textures that complimented each component. My 9 month old daughter loved the appetizer and voiced out her opinion for this dish in lots of googoos and gagas. The rib eye entree was so delicious... it cut like butter and the bleu cheese on the meat gave it a awesome taste I was not expecting especially because I am not a fan of bleu cheese. The chicaron on top of the rib eye was the best I have ever had... it was simply AMAZING. The bone marrow appetizer was one that I expected more from but it was not disappointing, just mediocre. Having fried bone marrow was probably not such a good idea because the marrow just melts in your mouth but the batter stuck onto my tonsils and caused me to choke. However, the sides for the bone marrow were delicious.. especially the bacon jam. 

The alcoholic beverages were strong; which is good because it prevents from going overboard with ordering too many cocktails.. one cocktail did last me the entire dinner.. and I did feel \"good\" at the end of the night. That's probably what I deserve after asking the server what strong fruity drink she would recommend..

I am excited about coming here again and was so happy to experience the food of Lola."}
{"text":"Lola's food is seriously good, but my absolute favorite item on the menu is the sticky toffee pudding. I first had it during a December visit, and it was on the menu then as figgy pudding, and I'd never had professionally-made figgy pudding before, so even though I NEVER order dessert, I couldn't resist. OMG. The lightly candied almonds, the poached pears, the cream cheese ice cream -- did I mention that I NEVER order dessert?  When I do break down and order a dessert, I never, ever finish it. I finished it. And I've been back three times. One time we were staying at the Hyatt at the Arcade, and we just decided we weren't hungry enough for an actual dinner, and I made my husband walk over to pick up a carryout order of sticky toffee pudding."}
{"text":"My first top chef dining experience. I went many years ago during a visit to Ohio and remember being in love with the space. I remember loving the short ribs since it was my first time having them. However, the standout will always be the bacon ice cream for dessert. It couldn't have been a better way to spend an anniversary in that area."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their dessert menu and craft drinks! Perfect location and quite a stunning restaurant. Definitely a must try for all visitors of Cleveland"}
{"text":"If you speak to anybody that lives in Cleveland and you ask them for a restaurant recommendation, one of the first places to come out of their mouths will probably be Lola.  How can I turn that down?

I perused the menu online before I went just to make sure it wasn't all steak.  I was pleasantly surprised that there was spicy yellowtail sashimi on the appetizer menu.  Unfortunately, when I went to order it, it wasn't on the menu that evening.  But they did have a variation, so I ordered it and gobbled it up.  It was a bit more Hawaiian than I'd like, but nevertheless it agreed with my tummy.

For my main course I had the pasta:  fettuccine, winter greens, butternut squash and sweet potato.  I was stuffed half way through and if my body would've let me, I would have kept on eating until I exploded.  I'm not even a pasta fan but it wasn't traditional and my my was it delicious.

My only recommendation would be to go on a night that isn't that busy and definitely steer clear when there's a Cavs game--you'll never get out of the parking lot."}
{"text":"A restaurant that actually lived up to the hype!"}
{"text":"The thing is you can get this menu at any country club and it would be just as forgettable.  Steak, Roast Chicken, Dover Sole, Bibb Salad, blah, blah, blah.  Dessert?  Did not stay, did not even look but I would not be surprised if it was the standard Chocolate Lava Cake, Creme Brulee and Tiramisu (a cliche if ever I saw one)

The location is great, the room beautiful although the chairs are made of this material that makes you feel like you are stuck to a Post-It note.  The servers were exceptional, they deboned our sole with the skill of a surgeon.  Our waiter was okay.   

At half the price the meal would have been forgettable, but at this price it is a painful memory.

Note to self:  Skip any restaurant where the owner is on TV"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday dinner and it was delicious. 

//Appetizers:

Beef Cheek Pierogi: Okay, these were just amazing. You get two large pierogis (perfect because it was me and my boyfriend eating) and they are stuffed to the max with pulled beef cheek. It was delicious. The Horseradish Creme Fraiche was delicious. 

Pork Belly: My boyfriend enjoyed these. I however, didn't so much. Honestly, I'm just not a pork person so I can't count that against my rating here. 

//Entrees:

Cavatelli: This amazing dish had Wild Boar, Leeks and Parmesan. It was TO DIE FOR. I mean honestly, it was amazing right down to the softness of the cavatelli. I loved every bite of this.

Smoked Pork Chop: This was my boyfriend's dish. I didn't have the pork but OH MY GOD, the Polenta was amazing! I wish I could have an entire bowl of it! 

//Service:

Service was really great. Our server was very friendly but not overbearingly so. I have no complaints here.

//Drinks:

I went with a White Peach Bellini and the boyfriend had a glass of wine. My Bellini was delicious. 

By the way, the drink list is on an iPad so that adds to the cool factor of this place. 

//Misc:

The last thing I purchased was a signed copy of Michael Symon's book. I had to. It is going to look great in my kitchen and I'm pretty stoked to read it. It's full of great photos, recipes and anecdotes."}
{"text":"My husband and I brought three teenagers to town for a concert and while he took them to the concert, I treated myself to dinner at Lola. With a reservation for one being a tad awkward for me, to my delight they graciously seated me at the chef's table overlooking the kitchen. The service was impeccable and the food was delicious!  I would definitely recommend the Beef Cheek Pierogi for an appetizer. My entire experience from start to finish was easily 5-star."}
{"text":"The food was off the charts delicious. The Beef Cheek Pierogi's WOW, Oysters WOW, Scallops melting like butter in your mouth so perfectly cooked WOW, and the Lamb very tasty cooked to perfection. The topper and must have Basil ice cream! Five star experience!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and bartender doesn't get it when ordering cocktails.  This is Cleveland, so your better off ordering beer/wine.  MAYBE...gin/tonic???"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed a drink at the bar shucks trying to get in for dinner.  We failed at dinner reservations and did not was to eat at the bar.  So we each enjoyed a drink.  I had a Hendricks and tonic, the bartender asked if I wanted a lime or cucumber , which almost no one ever asks! This changed my initial stars from 3 to a 4.  The cocktail was just was I was looking for and my husband had a very dry framboise, which he didn't care for but I certainly helped him finish it.  I wish we could have gotten a table, but maybe next time we are in the area we can plan ahead."}
{"text":"What an awesome restaurant. Had the hanger steak and it was delicious. Cooked just right with just the perfect sauces. We also ordered the bone marrow. First time ever trying fried bone marrow. It was interesting but surprisingly good. All around this is a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Sit at the bar. See what is seasonal. And enjoy with wine or a cocktail. Many visits. All excellent."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Lola's to celebrate a special occasion. This was our first time there and we were so excited. The atmosphere and the drinks (Georgia mule and manhattan) were amazing, but I can't say the same for the food and prices. We started with the pierogi appetizer that friends had recommended. They were delicious, but we only were served  two for $12...seriously?!? Next we ordered our entrees, I had the cod and he had the pork chops. The cod was cold and bland, far from the best fish I've had and I would never order it again there. My boyfriend said the porkchops were okay, but not the best. Not to mention they were overpriced.... $30  and the sides were extra. We had the potatoes as our side they were okay, but not great. Last, we had what I was looking forward to the most and heard so much about... The 6am dessert (bacon ice cream, French toast, etc), this lived up to my expectations and well worth the $9. My boyfriend had the peanut butter pretzel dessert, which wasn't great and should be called 'two bites' because it was so tiny! So, overall we loved the atmosphere, drinks, and the 6am special, but think it is overpriced and didn't love the entrees."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to make a 5.5 hour drive to Cleveland to check out this Michael Symon restaurant. It was a Saturday night around 9 pm, we had no reservations but the wait wasn't too bad. Overall the ambience of the place is great. Unfortunately, the waiter took about 10 minutes to come to our table and greet himself. As soon as he comes we quickly put in our order. Now I understand it is a busy Saturday evening but there is no excuse for waiting 50 minutes for our food to come out. We ordered the hanger steak and scallops. The hanger steak was okay, nothing special. My friends scallops were not even seared on both sides, that's pretty much cooking 101. So she sent it back and they brought her a brand new plate. This time the scallops are still not seared on both sides and now they're extremely salty. Eating them was like pouring salt down your throat. Now the manager did apologize for the scallops not being cooked properly and offered my friend a drink but this is no excuse for a restaurant in this price range to serve food like this."}
{"text":"LOLA caught my eye on our way to the \"Bodies\" exhibit.  When the question of where to eat guys? was posed, I did not hesitate to say LOLA.  We were seated at the chef's table, and we are right in the middle of it all.  Mine started with the tomato salad, what a wonderful starter.  I ordered the hanger steak which was excellent, and for dessert went with Pauline's - a wonderful banana bread with sour cream ice cream.  Thank you Lola to end the day of a first timer in Cleveland.  Thank you Michael Simon!"}
{"text":"Been here maybe 10 times and it gets better with each visit.  One of the finest restaurants around.  Don't miss out while in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Happily, I can finally give a personal 5 star rating to a restaurant in Cleveland.  You never know whether your palate will agree with the hype, but for me, this one did live up to the expectations.

I had a very taxing day in the clinic, final procedure finishing at roughly 9:45 pm.  I rang up the manager who told me not to worry about arriving late for my 9:45 booking for one.  I drove aimlessly around the address looking for parking, somewhat distressed by the presence of numerous working crews and police, obviously working on very important street upgrades and safety issues.

So, finally arriving at 10:30, I finally got to step inside this dimly lit, swanky Lola.  I grabbed a seat at the bar while the table was being readied.  A Macallan 12 neat to whet the appetite and the table was set.

I set at the Chef's counter, which is interesting due to its placement looking over the kitchen.  The counter itself is internally lit, creating an interesting effect of warm, yellowish, streaked stone.

I started with an order of a Barberesco Montaribaldi (2003) and quaffed expectantly as I got the Querciabella sweet bread and a complimentary order of roast pork belly in a dashi sauce.

Of the two, I found the pork belly more delectable.  The Dashi sauce was puncuated with several rather perky peppers which contrasted well.  The roasted pork belly had flavouring tones that are distinctly asian.  Great dish.  

The sweetbreads were also good.  Roast on the outside and succulent on the inside, I sopped up every bit of the slightly tangy sauce, very well nearly clearing the plate.  Very nuanced flavour, with satisfying complexity.

I then had the hanger steak and fries.  The rosemary seasoned fries are quite good.  Although at first the seasoning may seem a bit unconventional, it lightens the experience of the thin-cut frittes.  The steak wasn't as impressive as the other two items, but I was still quite happy with the overall meal.

The bacon ice cream and french toast was very good...  It's amazing that such seemingly contrasting elements can work so well together.  Go for it.

Servers were very friendly.  The manager/sommelier and I had a 10 minute talk about italian reds and philosphies in stocking cellars.  Great dinner conversation.  My server merrily spoke about nearby good eats which was a welcome after dinner treat.

Right now, I prefer Lola over just about everything else I've had here.  Still exploring!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious!  The halibut had a nice flavor to it.  The hanger steak was so tender and prepared perfectly.  We had the 6 am dessert, the bacon ice cream was awesome!  Def must have!"}
{"text":"4.5! I'll round up to 5 stars.

I had a great time with my bf here. The place has a great ambiance and atmosphere!

Now, onto the food. I've been to Michael Symon's most upscale restaurant only for lunch, and that was several years ago. (I enjoyed the beef cheek pierogies back then - soo good.) I was a little sad that I had gone pescetarian because I never got a good chance to try the pork that he loves so much.

For appetizers, we shared the fresh oysters (mmmm -- it was good) and the lobster salad. I would say the lobster salad was fresh, but it wasn't the most unique or mind-blowing appetizer.

I ordered the shellfish and the bf ordered the braised short ribs. Mine came with plentiful shellfish, including mussels, shrimp, squid, and scallops. My dish was interesting; it was a play on pork and beans (as most of his dishes are a play on Midwestern dishes) that included beans and house-made sausage (which I gave to my boyfriend. He liked it.) It was definitely a new combination of combining the rich smokiness of the pork/beans and the seafood. Suggestion -- finish off your bread by dipping it in the spicy paprika broth. 

From what the bf said, the short ribs were very rich and done well.

As for dessert, we shared the 6AM. How can french toast and ice cream taste so good??? Basically, if you go, you should finish your meal with this dessert.

Service: very attentive, gave great & honest suggestions with the dessert, cool ipad drink menu. 5 for service.

Shoutout to my bf for a wonderful meal :) :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love love love this restaurant!! It is the best hands down!! From the atmosphere, to the service from their amazing staff and to the amazing food!!! Everything is just phenomenal!! It has never disappointed me and the others I have recommended to go there!! Sitting at the chefs table to definitely a treat that should be experienced by everyone!!"}
{"text":"I have to say for a iron chef restaurant it felt underwhelming the first around. The place looks classy and feels classy, but the entrees didn't live up to the expectations.

We started with the bone marrow appetizer which was probably the best part of the night. These melt in your mouth morsels are complimented well with the assortment of breads and other condiments. For entrees, I ordered the pork chop and my boyfriend ordered a fish dish. Both tasted good, but lacking in flavor for a world class restaurant.

I have to say the menus on iPads were a nice touch and the restaurant looks elegant, but next time around I hope the food matches the expectations."}
{"text":"I know this isn't a place for vegetarians, but I do appreciate the fact that Michael Symon offers vegetarian and vegan options.  I just wish I liked them more.

For lunch I had a half grilled cheese sandwich and some tomato soup.  The grilled cheese was thin and nicely toasted, but nothing that blew me away. The soup was fresh and nicely seasoned, but just fine.  Overall nothing to get too excited about.

Vegetarians and vegans who eat here with carnivore friends will have some options and will come away satisfied, if not overjoyed."}
{"text":"I was really impressed! From the waiter's deep knowledge of all things culinary to the cleanliness of the entire restaurant, it was not a let down whatsoever. Amazing food and extraordinary service made this dinner meeting something special. I will definitely go back and highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is more like a 3.5.. This is the second visit..and both times the ambiance and service was great. It was pouring rain and the hostess called a taxi for us.. It was very kind of her. My issue is the food.. Everything we had was great.. But the steak. It was too salty for my taste..so rating is a little lower.. Can't have the main course lack luster.. But the Marrow was great.. Cauliflower Soup and mix salad was very good.. Really a solid place to try!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, however I prefer Lolita regardles of price.

Awesome:
-Pork belly and crispy ear - unless you hate pork, I guarantee you wil love this dish.   One of the best pork belly dishes I have had.   The melon chunks in the dish add a great sweet touch.
-Beef cheek pierogies

Very good:
-Smoked Berkshire Pork Chop - juicy, expertly prepared, and good flavors from the sauces

OK:
-Wild Salmon - Expertly prepared, but lacking any noteworthy flavors.

Not a fan:
-Pound Cake French Toast with Maple Bacon Ice Cream - although this is a \"signature\" dessert, I found it very disappointing.   The pound cake is deep fried and comes wth ice cream on top.   The maple ice cream starts out sweet, then hits you with a salty and crispy bacon flavor.   The ice cream flavors are unique and good depending on how much you like bacon, but the pound cake that is deep fried was a miss in my opinion.  I can't see why anyone would deep fry pound cake...it doesn't make it better."}
{"text":"There is a reason for the hype.  I usually detour from restaurants that are this well-reviewed and popular, but this place lives up to every expectation.  The interior is interesting and the bar just glows.  We had some great cocktails, and the food was SOOOO fabulous-- in particular, the braised pork shank and hanger steak. I know that part of our wonderful experience is because of our waiter, Robert-- he sets the standard for restaurant professional.  He was informative, charming, witty, and the perfect host for our night-- highly recommend this place, and ask to sit in Robert's section!"}
{"text":"Stiff drinks and Good steaks!  I can not say enough about this place.  Chef Symon hit the nail on the head several times!"}
{"text":"Didn't have reservations on Saturday about 5-6 PM, walked in and we were seated.

appetizer: beef cheek pierogi: it was good. Tasted like a pierogi, but wasn't oily. It was above par.

mixed grain salad: it was a bunch of grains and berries. It had an acidic dressing. It was different. Never had anything like it before. It was a bit tart, but was definitely above par.

strip steak: my girlfriend and I split it.  It was more than enough. The potatoes on top were crunchy. The meat was pretty good.  

Lola fries: they were really tasty to me.  My gf thinks they use a different oil, something with a meat flavoring? It was good, I couldn't stop eating them, but I had to save room for and finish the steak.

tiramisu: It was presented in a line form around the rim of the plate. It doesn't look like the typical tiramisu. The ingredients were presented artistically.  It was fantastic visually and p(a)late-ly!

OVERALL IMPRESSION:
I'd go back, it was one of the finer dining experiences I've had, for sure."}
{"text":"I was so excited when we arrived here, knowing it was a popular restaurant, by a well respected chef. We arrived about 20 minutes early for our 9:15 reservation and were told they couldn't seat us, so we looked for a spot at the bar where we could sit and enjoy a cocktail and there were none. 

For these prices, with a place as well respected I would have figured the staff would have done more to keep us there, but they didn't mention being able to prepare a table early or order us something from the bar, even when we said we were going elsewhere for a drink. 

When we returned and we're seating, I was impressed with the ambiance of the place- it really does have a super sexy feel to it. The cocktail and wine lists are excellent and the quality of the cocktails was awesome. 

We perished the menu, but I wasn't feeling something quite as fancy as everything there, so went with a salad, the cauliflower appetizer and a side of Brussels sprouts. The Brussels were amazing - really delicious, but the cauliflower was bland and seriously unimaginative, and the salad was average. The food overall was disappointing for this caliber of restaurant and price point. 

The service was good, but felt slightly rushed. I wouldn't come back here to eat, but would return for a cocktail anytime."}
{"text":"At his request, I took my husband to Cleveland over the weekend to celebrate his 50th birthday.  His wish was to visit the R&R Hall of Fame, and have dinner here.  I was able to snag the chef's table, as a surprise.  We had a blast!  Every bit of the food was amazing, from the cocktails (try the O.M.G. - OMG!!!) to the bread (yikes!!) to the hangar steak and frites (he got the pork chop and the beef check pierogi, also excellent).  As full as we were, we refused to share a dessert, and Mike got the 6 AM Special, while I had the carrot cake - again, amazing.  Also very cool to watch the food being prepared."}
{"text":"Expectations met! I was at the Green House Tavern next door and what a disappointment. 

Hearing this was a celebrity Michael Symon's place I wanted to see if the taste matched the hype and it exceeded. Whoever pan fries bone marrow is simply genius!

From the appetizers to the dessert you cannot go wrong. You made a believer out of me. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Got to check this place out earlier this year. Brian and I were in Ohio for my work's holiday party and stayed the weekend and checked out Cleveland. We met some friends for dinner at Lola's and we weren't disappointed. I definitely think that Michael's restaurants are geared more towards meat lovers, and since I'm not such a huge meat eater, they're not always tailored for me. However, whatever I do get, I love. I got the pasta, my boyfriend got the steak, our friends got the duck and steak. We were all very happy. The best part of the meal, for me, was the s'more dessert. It was heaven!"}
{"text":"I've been to both Lola and Lolita.  In fact, when I went there this past summer, I did not even realize that it had 'changed'.  
And changed is a very subjective word, I suppose, because I found almost nothing different about the place, other than their use of that new Riedel stemless glassware, of which I am not a fan.  
I mean, come on, the whole point of the stem on the glassware is so that you:  a) do not look like a douchebag when you are drinking wine by clamping your hand around a large, bulbous mass; and b) do not get greasy fingerprints all over the crystal while lifting the glass to your lips. 

Uh, right.  Anyway, the food is still great, and I like the new small plate menu for appetizers."}
{"text":"Beef cheek pierogi was really good.  Never had beef cheeks so I was scared...but I really liked them.  Mac and Cheese was really good too, like really.  Would love to go back for a dinner.  Must say I loved the experience and food but my mind was not blown."}
{"text":"I try to avoid celebrity chef restaurants, and this one isn't very different. You lose the soul of the chef when he's not there in favor of more watered-down dishes that a team of anybody can produce in his place. The menu was pretty standard with the kind of dishes you'd pretty much expect at any white tablecloth restaurant, but executed well. The real interesting plates are all on the appetizer menu. If I am able to go back someday I'll only order off the appetizer menu. I still think about the fried pig ears I had there and try to imagine how I can make them at home."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to my trip to Cleveland, in part, because of my expected trip to Lola's. As many have mentioned the Beef Cheek Perogies were amazing and a must have. I went with the pork chop, and while tasty with the cheesy polenta, the pork chop was a bit over cooked, the caramelized onions were so minuscule there was only enough to include with about 3-4 bites. 

The service was adequate, but not outstanding. Mixed drinks seemed to be the thing, but I went for local Cleveland beers, which there was only 3 and all were bottled. Maybe I'm a beer snob, but I'd prefer a place like this to have some good local taps.

I'll go back sometime when I'm in Cleveland again, but I expected much more for the hype and cost."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner. Valet, $18; easier to find a spot and park! Staff was friendly and inviting from the moment you stepped in the door! Food was delicious and the perfect amount. I ordered the Beef Hanger Steak that came with the irresistible Lola fries. A must have! Definitely worth checking Lola out if you are in town or want a taste of luxury tucked away in Cleveland."}
{"text":"We had the opportunity to dine here over the weekend and can definitely say that this was the highlight of our out of town experience!

Where do we start?  As foodies, we are of course fans of Chef Symon, but knew full well that he was not likely to be present on site (he wasn't).  Regardless, his presence was definitely felt with the offerings that hit our table.

We opened the meal with an appetizer of bone marrow, having never had the opportunity to try this food previously.  Around this time we were presented with a drink menu on an iPad, which we politely declined since we do not drink.  Our feelings about the appetizer were mixed, given that it was our first experience with bone marrow and weren't sure how the \"correct way\" was supposed to be.  A number of options were presented as a topping for the marrow on the bread, our recommendation is the pickled shallots and the garlic spread with a couple drops of lemon.  The one downside was that the marrow was fried which left an odd coating in our mouths, drowning the subtleties of the other flavors offered.

For the main course, one of us had the halibut, the other, the pork chop.  The halibut was terrific, surprisingly filling, despite the initial look of the plate.  The shiitake mushrooms had a spice that reminded you to combine the other elements on the plate into a single bite for a more cohesive flavor layering.  The pork chop was a revelation!  The chef recommends the cook on it to be medium, and we agree!  Given that there hasn't been a widespread case of trichinosis in the United States in decades, we weren't afraid to venture from the world of well-done pork.  Despite prior misgivings we've had about polenta, it was a hidden gem on the plate that supported the main star perfectly!  The smoky barbecue sauce accompanying the chop was delectable and left us wanting just one more bite at the end.

Lest we have an incomplete experience, we indulged in the desert menu, one of us going after the s'more, the other the 6 AM Special.  We declare: skip breakfast for dinner and just make it a dessert!  The maple bacon ice cream was just fabulous!  The s'more was a deconstructed delight of our childhood with all the sophistication of a dessert for royalty!

Hats off to the staff and compliments to the chef!  This was truly an amazing experience, and next time we are in Cleveland for a special occasion, we are sure to stop in!"}
{"text":"I think this place is totally overrated. I think Michael Symon knows food but his creativity is disappointing. My mother cooked this stuff and he's just brought it back."}
{"text":"Really, one of the best restaurants in Cleveland. They have plenty of reviews already, so I'll just add that I've never had a bad experience here, and will definitely keep coming back. 5 stars from the food to the service to the cocktails to the atmosphere to the location."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner....grapefruit ginger cocktail, beef cheek perogies, arugala and fennel salad, scallops, duck fat fries"}
{"text":"Cleveland rocks in more ways than one.  Stay downtown and go out to experience this fantastic city! Start with dinner at Lola.  I enjoyed the amazing sturgeon fish dinner with a cauliflower soup and it was amazing! The bar if beautiful and the variety of wine is incredibly deep. I'm tired from having so much fun in the city, so I am cutting this review short.  Therefore... in short... go there!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Cleveland for two days so i googled to find the best food places. This restaurant is rated as one of the best in Cleveland. After my meal, I started to question Cleveland food scene.. I feel that we have much better options down here in ATL..  i started with beef pierogi aka polish dumpling. Supposedly a big polish population in cleveland and pierogis were everywhere. It was missing something in taste but cant point out. I was feeling hungry so i went for medium rare rib eye. Initially it felt burnt.. then i started to enjoy it a little more. It had a ton of animal fat and tendon which i had to remove. I wish it was removed. The best part was probably the roasted potatoes and caramelized onions. Oh my! So good. I got vanilla bean creme brulee as dessert. It was not the best creme brulee i had to say the least. The top was too crispy sugary.. I feel like vanilla beans were at the bottom. I didnt touch the cookies that came with it bc i was full. For all this, I paid nearly 100 bucks (no alcohol) and left. I can say that i had much better dinners for the same money in ATL. 
It is located on 4th street, which is full with restaurants. I especially liked the flowers out on the street. Definitely a street to check out but maybe save your money for some other place."}
{"text":"My hubby and I dined here for our anniversary.   Lola exceeded our expectations in every possible way!  Amazing meal, gorgeous atmosphere, and fantastic staff... all is can say is WOW and Michael Symon ROCKS!!!  The wine selection is great... and the ipads are really cool!  We started with the charcuterie plate and not so much as a crumb was left on the board.  I had the scallops...best scallops I have ever had in my life....hands down!  Hubby had the hanger steak and loved it.  Our only complaint was that we didn't find room for dessert!  It's one thing to get great food but to be served by such an amazing staff along with the food doesn't happen all too often for us.  We live in NY and this was absolutely worth the trip and we will go back time and time again."}
{"text":"We ate here for our anniversary and had a wonderful experience. Our server was excellent! We had a bottle of the Lulu 62 Pinot Noir and enjoyed learning that it was named for the chef's wife and blended specially for the restaurant. To start we had the crab bake appetizer and local greens salad. Our entrees were the hangar steak and sea scallops. We had the Lola S'more for dessert! Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Another stellar experience at Lola! The beef cheek pierogies are a must try. My venison entree was also quite good. I'm a sucker for any dish with Chef Symon's Brussels sprouts. One of these times I'll manage to save room for the maple bacon ice cream."}
{"text":"Despite some of my prior experiences at restaurants owned by celebrity chefts which have been overly disappointing (Mesa Grill in NY comes to mind), Lola met my high expectations.  My Friday evening 9:15 reservation was timely honored.  We were seated in one of the tables for 2 against the back wall - with a banquette on one side.  The table was fine but I would have liked slightly more space in between tables, so that I didn't feel as if I was sitting at a communal table.

After an uncomfortable hard sell on a bottle of wine (we already had undrunk cocktails from the bar placed in front of us), the server came over and convinced me to order the pork chop over the scallops.  5 minutes after our order was placed, our neighbor received the scallops, which looked incredible (4 massive scallops with a brght green pea puree).  I had buyer's remorse for a little while until our entrees arrived.

We split the oysters (6) for $17, which is about the same price point as NY - they were very fresh, briny with a pleasant sweetness.  Homemade mignonette sauce was particularly good.  Strangely, there no accompaniment of horseradish or cocktail sauce though.  We also had the fried chicken livers, which were not hot (not sure if that was by design) but they were crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside - served with a plum sauce that I thought was slightly bitter. 

As for entrees - as the other reviewers have noted, the pork chop was incredible - smoky and sweet.  The cheesy polenta it came with was decadent and the barbecued onions were excellent.  My wife ordered the ribeye, which was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  

The 6am breakfast was probably one of the most memorable desserts I have ordered from a restaurant.  I am a chocolate person but the maple bacon ice cream is probably the best ice cream I have ever tasted.

Also, as a side note, the Hot and Dirty martini was one of the best martinis I have had.  Tito's vodka, hot sauce and blue cheese stuffed olives - fantastic.

I want to give the restaurant 4.5 stars but I have to round down for not so commensurate service.  Unnecessary hard sell on the wine, bread basket did not come out until after our appetizers were finished, and we had to request the cookies that are supposed to come with your bill."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I wanted to love Lola but it was really a disappointment. The restaurant is dimly lit with loud acoustics but appealing and the menu had lots to offer. Unfortunately the food wasn't that great. My pasta was over cooked and not freshly made, the roasted chicken was tender but not that flavorful (and at 65.00 for chicken, it really should be amazing). The food including the sides was overall pretty heavy. The service was super slow and unorganized which was perhaps the worst part of this expensive meal."}
{"text":"I have been here once before and it didn't stick out too much. The food was great obviously, but CLE has so much to offer with awesome restaurants lately. ANYWAY, tonight we went for my husbands birthday and it was FANTASTIC. It was crazy busy (especially for a Wednesday night in my opinion) and our service was great. Our server (Joe? But I had a lot of martinis), was so attentive. He was very conscientious of the timing of our food and had a hawk eye for empty glasses! We tried the bone marrow (which I always love at home and other places), but I didn't realize here they take it out of the bone and kind of flash fry it. So easy to eat and delectable. Our party also got the hams appetizer, pierogis, frisée salad, pork shank, strip steak, and rib eye steak.  Pork shank was falling off the bone tender. The strip steak had a great pepper crust with delicious hollandaise (peppercorn crust is not my cup of tea but even I liked that). The rib eye was melting in our mouth tender, perfectly cooked, and served with a ton a sauces (I love options). The herbed olive oil was my favorite along with fat, flakey Snow White salt flakes. For birthday dessert, even the gel writing (in jam?!) tastes good. This visit made a lasting impression and am already daydreaming about returning."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and our must have items are the beef cheek pierogis and the 6am special. I hope they are never removed from the menu.

I'm not a fan of scallops and even after trying them here, I am still not a fan. It may sound like a weird appetizer, but the pig's ears are quite good so don't be afraid to give it a try when it's available."}
{"text":"The bf and I had made a reservation to eat here, but we actually ended up in the area and were feeling really hungry an hour before our reservation. When we asked if it was possible to just be seated then, they agreed right away.

Despite almost every single table being available, they ended up seating us in a spot against the wall, and it was not the most comfortable. I can't say it was on purpose, but I did kind of get the feeling that they were trying to hide us. Possibly because we looked quite young and don't necessarily look the type to be at a nicer restaurant. I hope I'm just overthinking it, because I never really got the feeling of being ignored or snubbed by the servers. In fact our server was incredibly friendly and helpful, to the point that she seemed a little unprofessional--at least what I would expect from a nicer place. Again, just some of my thoughts.

As you can tell from the 4 stars rating, none of the issues I noted really detracted from the overall experience I had here. That is probably because the food was just that good:
+Beef Hanger Steak ($31): comes with delicious Lola fries! Meat was well seasoned and tender.
+Braised Pork Shank ($31): I was surprised by the portions! The meat was so tender, flavorful, and was easily pulled off of the bone. Even the bed of vegetables the meat was lying on was delicious. 
+The 6am Special ($10): This was good to try once, but just not my type of dessert. 

Lola is definitely on the pricier side, but I think it is still reasonable considering the quality and taste of the food. Plus, the portions were larger than what I had been expecting. Definitely worth it to come here for a special occasion. I'm so glad I got to eat here once during my time in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Pretty underwhelming for a restaurant with so much hype. There really wasn't a dish that I thought was deserving of the restaurant's praise."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim (yes, I realize this is not exactly an on the whim kind of restaurant). I live close by so it was an easy decision and with all the great reviews, i thought to myself, why not? 

Atmosphere is beautiful, darker setting and very romantic if you wanted to come here on a date, it's perfect! Front desk, was friendly and I was seated upon arrival. 

Waitress came immediately after and gave her recommendations and specials of the night which seemed very appetizing, but I should probably add here that I came here because I was bored and not very hungry (lol). So I thought I would try a few random things.

I ordered the famous Lola fries which are perfectly seasoned skinny fries, a beet salad, it was extremely refreshing and appetizing! The arugula was so flavorful, I wanted more! My friend ordered shrimp and I thought it was very flavorful too. 

For dessert, I ordered the Lola S'more, the chocolate in that thing yummm, so rich, a mix of dark and milk chocolate (I think), JUST YUM! 

I would come again but I'd like to get an entree to get a real feel for the great food offered at this restaurant. 

All in all, an overall pleasant dining experience. Prices are midrange, but still fair."}
{"text":"I love Micheal Symon...  Randomly dropped in on a busy Saturday and was placed in the bar area which was fine. 

They had a great beer selection and dress code is important to them. 

Great vibe and will try it again perhaps on a weekday!!"}
{"text":"I waited 1 week to do this review and eliminate my personal emotion. 

Questions: Flagship restaurant? Iron Chef? Premium fine dining?

First, the food tasted \"ok\". Second, this was the second and last destination of our Cleveland trip. We are happy return customers of 'Roast' in Detroit, another Symon fine dining location. It's superb. The service, the atmosphere, the food. Excellent. 

Lola was such a disappointment. A complete fail, by any restaurant, but a super fail by an iron chef self proclaimed \"flagship location\" of his brand. In stead of
The entire play-by-play of the evening that I normally would, I'll do highlights of issues.

* reservation was later, 8:15.
* beautiful table right in the front window for a special occasion.
* limited menu options
* the gnocchi app was mushy and over cooked.
* the braised beef cheek pierogi app was served cold
* the smoked pork chop while warm on the outside, was actually cold on the tongue. - not just cooled down from sitting, but not warmed through even the slightest -
* the waiter was sweating a lot, gross.
* The 2 hostesses can an approximate combined age of 36 and the aptitude and observation skills of an Applebee's hostess.
* the cocktails were very good, but were very, very late. It took April 12 minutes to get the drinks after ordering.
* failure of waitstaff, hostesses, mgr, to notice the issues, correct the issues, avoid the issues.
* failure of staff to inform of parking validation or
Offer to take/call the number into the valet to have them bring the car around, especially in the rain with seniors in fancy clothes it tow. 
* failure to walk patrons out to the valet with the restaurant umbrellas. Or offer to borrow them with the retrieval being owned by the restaurant.
* failure of The manager to approach the table until we were literally standing/walking out of the restaurant.
* we witnessed an actual fire in the kitchen, Which obviously caused commotion/concern/ruckus in the open/viewable kitchen.
* silverware is balanced oddly and makes you manhandle a fork.
* 5 entrees, 2 apps, 7 cocktails, 2 deserts. $400 approx. including tip.

BOTTOM LINE: We live to dine out - especially at remarkable locations. I love paying for the experience if it warrants. This would have been acceptable and maybe a 3.2 star experience at a $20-23 a plate place on a busy night. But, not at an iron chef flagship location charging $35+ a plate - and not busy. This is a shame.

Mr Symon: Roast is in the right class. This was failure, it's time to steer the ship to Detroit for some etiquette lessons."}
{"text":"Our food was absolutely 5 stars.  The 4 stars? Our server.  We'd go back for the menu and drinks, but would ask to be moved from her section.

{"text":"Best gourmet we've had. We traveled all the way from Niagra Falls to Cleveland (as we were headed to Chicago on a road trip) just to go to lunch. Michael Symon is a genius chef and I would eat at his restaurant any time. I just wish I lived in Cleveland! His flavors are balanced and delicious. And prices were not ridiculous either. Totally attainable without being \"stuffy\". Thanks Michael for a great meal."}
{"text":"Get the  beef cheek pierogi appetizer. You will not be disappointed. Went here for my engagement dinner. The staff was so kind and accommodating bringing sparkling wine to the table and a congratulations dessert. They have a wonderful wine selection and the meals were very filling! Several table mates had a lamb special and I got the beef hanger steak. It is a bit pricey and the menu is select which is why I went with a 4 star rating."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in town for a wedding and decided to check this place out. It was fantastic!!! The wine list was awesome, extensive and unique. The food was delicious. I was impressed overall. If we are ever back in Cleveland I would definitely go back. Everything was a treat!"}
{"text":"So I came in alone and sat at the bar. The ambiance is great with the lit undertone. I got the Tuna Tartare which was amazing. It was perfect for one person, I would not have shared. Next was the autumn vegetable. Something about these charred carrots was to die for. The hints of cinnamon and cocoa were strong, but it had a nice spice.

Overall, extremely impressed by the food and more impressed by the staff. I'll be back next week when I'm in town."}
{"text":"LOLA, lo lo lo loooo laaa! Wow, just great impressions all around. We started out at the bar since we were early for our reservations and wanted to sit at the beautifully lit up bar. There is an understated sophistication to Lola that I really loved. The atmosphere is grand, but not in an overly fancy way. The kitchen is exposed and very nice and clean and modern. It's not the quietest place to eat a meal, but it has a really romantic and classy feel to it.  It's welcoming and kind of kitchy even with the various pig statues on glass shelves as you walk in. 

The bar service was fast and friendly. Wasting no time, I started with the Hot and Dirty Martini, per fellow Yelper's recommendations and I wasn't disappointed. The olives stuffed with blue cheese were the winning touch for me, so much that I had the bartender top me off with more before heading to my table. 

The atmosphere is grand, but not in an overly fancy way. The kitchen is exposed and very nice and clean and modern. It's not the quietest place to eat a meal, but it has a really romantic and classy feel to it. 

For an entree we started with the Ceviche. The fish was fresh, the avocado & fresh citrus acid cutting through it all just really was the perfect start to a great summer dinner. Next, I ordered the Walleye with Corn puree. The crisp skin of the walleye, the sweet fluffy fresh pureed corn...it all just came together so well. The result was a harmony that resonated bite after bite. 

For dessert we ordered The 6AM Special. Do yourself a favor GET THIS DESSERT!!! Holy smokes. It's made of Brioche French Toast & topped with Maple Bacon ice cream & caramelized apple. My only one super knit picky complaint would be don't skimp us on the caramelized apple, Lola! That stuff is off the charts good mixed in all together as one \"perfect bite\" combo. Near the end, my husband and I were fighting over the last bits of apple to go with the remaining ice cream and brioche french toast. Leave it to Michael Symon to come up with such an inventive and dangerously delicious concoction! We were so happy with our meal that we decided we \"needed\" a signed copy of Symon's book. I'm a long shot from being a chef, certainly not one of Symon's stature...but one can dream! ;)"}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance...amazing service and amazing food... Pork belly... Hanger steak.. And their signature dessert... Don't miss this place If you are in Cleveland..!"}
{"text":"So over-rated.  Bland, flavorless food.  Ordered the Spicy Tomato Bisque....no spice, no flavor.  Also, ordered the Fried Balogna Sandwich (with egg, raw mild cheddar, herb aioli, frisee and pickled red onion) on an English muffin.  It sounded so good and it was so bland.  The pickled red onion on my sandwich was the size of a dime. Our first and last visit."}
{"text":"You know when everyone is talking about something so you have to do it and it's just so-so. I hate that. Well, luckily this was not one of those times. 

I met a girlfriend at the much hyped Lola for a business woman's lunch. And we ordered the business woman's special*, which happened to be the tuna nicoise tartine. I was expecting something like at Tartine in Rocky River, but turns out a tartine is an open face sandwich. Who knew? Hope Tartine RR doesn't fine out and have to change it's name.

 ANYWAY... It was amazing. It had this great little potato salad and all the ingredients were so fresh and light. I literally ate every bite on the plate and would've licked it if I wasn't being all businessy. 

The waitress was extremely friendly and I kept thinking she was going to sit down at our table and have a bite. She also made a great white wine recommendation, which I am very hard to please on.

{"text":"Dear Lord in heaven this was outstanding.  I learned of Lola from Bourdain's show and it lived up to my expectations. I took my mom there for Mother's Day and wasn't disappointed.  The decor is on par with the best of NYC.  The wait-staff was attentive, professional and approachable.  The appetizers were small, but terrific.  For appetizers, the table shared the beef cheek pirogies (the meat was tender), the lobster salad and Berkshire bacon (more like pork ribs than bacon in their thickness and density).  The meat entres seem to outshine the seafood and are well worth the price.  The 6 a.m. breakfast dessert was outstanding (loved the bacon and maple syrup ice cream).  Prices were decent for any market."}
{"text":"Went there for a celebration recently. Superb service and the food was perfectly prepared. The sturgeon was fresh and awesome. The ribeye was tender, very flavorful and cooked perfectly. A must in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I was apprehensive about going as I've typically not had good experiences with celebrity chef restaurants but I must admit that Lola's was a pleasant exception.  The menu is quite eclectic with very unique offerings.  Staff was prompt, friendly, and efficient.  Definitely worth another visit.  Had no problem getting a reservation through OpenTable on a Wednesday evening."}
{"text":"Glad I was able to try this restaurant and sample the Michael Symon experience.  Having tried Lolita I had high hopes for Lola. Can't say that I'll go back however.  The food was good, I guess I was expecting more. I was surprised it wasn't more flavorful.  Sauces and broths lacked the extra punch I thought this restaurant would have.  Tried the beef check pierogi as everyone suggested, just nothing special.  Had the cioppino which had huge mussels and squid which was great, again the broth just really lacked the flavor I was hoping for.  Tried the s'more dessert which looked great from all the pictures, and it was good, just not great.  Decor creates a cozy environment.  Loved the glass behind the bar that allowed us to see through to the wall of wines behind it.  Great environment. But I don't feel the need to go back.  I'll stick  to Lolita instead"}
{"text":"So I came here because I watch the Chew and Michael Symon was on there and made the goat cheese ravioli. I had no idea who he was and tried the recipe and was in love. I was in Cleveland for a wedding and my cousin told me to check it out. I then realized that this was the place. The place is really cute and everyone is really nice. I honestly wasn't blown away by any of the food besides my mac and the beef app. Everything else was just ok."}
{"text":"VERY NICE RESTAURANT

This place is the flagship restaurant of the well known chef Michael Symon and is considered one of Cleveland's best. For lunch I had the Pork Belly Salad, which was delicious, and the Grilled Cheese Sandwich. I figured it takes guts not only to offer such a sandwich on the menu of such an upscale joint, but also to order it! However, the sandwich itself was nothing special and, in fact, the bread was a bit thick and dry. It did, however, come with delicious very thin French fries.

The interior of the place is very well done and certainly worth a visit. No doubt other items on the menu would make a return trip worthwhile.

{"text":"Best meal I've ever had, hands down. Best service, too. 

Our server was wonderful, and she was so patient in explaining the different menu items to my husband and I. When we got our food, it tasted so good! Words can't do it justice! 

My husband and I enjoyed the pork chops, and it melted in our mouths. He even remarked that they were better than his mother's. Now I know he enjoyed them ha ha!

We will definitely be back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and ordered the bone marrow as well as the braised lamb shank. Was a little disappointed with the marrow; it came with accompaniments I would not normally associate with marrow and in my opinion they would in no way enhance its flavor. Additionally, the chef had taken the liberty of removing the marrow from the bone and frying it. The pieces were fried unevenly and to me it was greasy and lacked any unusual flavor. Finally, the marrow platter came on a wooden block and mine had a large chunk missing that put me at risk for splinters. Such an overall disappointment. The lamb shank was nice but I didn't care much for the very bitter broccolini that accompanied it."}
{"text":"Had a lovely dinner here Thursday night. It is a really nice space and even tho I was 20 minutes late for my reservation ( I did call and warn them) we had a great table....very private with a nice view of the room and the open kitchen.

I had the soup....an onion creamy beauty with more crispy onions and some outstanding mushrooms garnishing.  absolutely fabulous.  and I enjoyed the bread that came earlier to the table.  Had a wonderful cab (Ibelieve) by the glass...really nice.  I think it was the choice from CA.  

My entree was the duck. which I usually  never order but the accompaniements with all the dinners weren't as interesting to me as this was.  It was served with a couscous with pine nuts and apricot bits and some small veggie..maybe bok choy?  the longer the plate sat in front of me the better it was.  almost like a wine that needed to breathe.

I ate every bite and, sadly, did not have room for the 6am which I really wanted to try.  My date had the pasta dish and I tried a bite but thought it was boring....had spring peas which shouldn't be in season now and I like to eat seasonally and locally so wouldn't have ordered it and am glad I didn't.  

they brought us each a perfect chocolate chip cookie to end the meal."}
{"text":"Michael Symon has cultivated something special at Lola. Starting off, your best bet is to make a reservation if you want to here. The ambience is a bit up scale but I would not call it fancy. The art in the restaurant is beautiful and very tasteful. The wine display when you first walk in is also stunning. It could server as a great date spot for anyone on the Cleveland area. The service was great. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. I did not hate that the drink menu was on and iPad but I also did not love it. It made switching between cocktails, beer, and wine a bit cumbersome but it was nice to see the visuals associated with the cocktails. Now for where this place shines, the food. We started our meal with the pierogis which were the perfect starter. The sauce on top was really the star of the appetizer. For the main course I ordered the pork chop which was fantastic. The smoke flavor was the perfect complement to the cheese grits it was served on top of. The portion was very large and filling. The lamb was also very good. Fall off the bone tender while still managing to pack an amazing flavor punch. We also ordered the Lola fries which were good but also barely got touched because we were so full after the appetizer and entrees. I wish we would have save room for dessert because the menu looked delicious. Just a nit picky thing, but the silverware the chose is back weighted and cylindrical so it does not feel the most comfortable in your hand. However, this place gets five stars and it also get a return reservation the next time I am in town. It is great."}
{"text":"There's a reason why Michael Symons and his restaurant Lola wins so many awards:  he creates incredibly delicious, innovative dishes with the freshest ingredients.  Tasting every dish was like trying a brand new experience; I could not wait to put food in my mouth and give my taste buds something new to explore!  Admittedly, I came for the beef cheek pierogis, but I loved everything else we ordered more.  The scallop ceviche was divine; the grain and stone fruit salad made with barley, farro, baby kale, peach and nectarines was unusual and delicious and something I could eat every day; Parisian Gnocchi was light yet flavored with king crab, clams, corn, and melt-in-your-mouth smoked pork, and the soup du jour was a creamy corn soup poured over crab.  Chef Symons seasons his creations perfectly and with a light hand, allowing the natural flavors of quality ingredients shine through.  Lola should be on your list of required places to go if you're ever in Cleveland.  I know it's going on a few of my Yelp lists."}
{"text":"One of the best Cleveland lunch spots. I work downtown and my co workers and I really like a good, quality lunch and Lola's is always 100% consistent.  The waitstaff is very efficient and understands the work crowd being on a timeline.  Never disappointed and always recommended."}
{"text":"What a fantastic experience from beginning to end. The menu is a bit adventurous for the average person, but if you can find something you'd try, please go!!! This was the best meal, best service, and best overall dining experience I've had in a long time. The service was excellent. The waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu, and was very patient with us when we had a lot of questions about how things were prepared and the ingredients used (some picky eaters in our group!). Probably one of the few places where the prices actually match the quality of food and service you get. I will absolutely be going back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Great people watching!"}
{"text":"Outstanding all around!  The food is to die for, the service is stellar, and the atmosphere is chic!  Michael Symon and staff have a great joint here!  Check it out and indulge in the 6am special for dessert, the maple bacon ice cream is amazingly scrumptious!!!"}
{"text":"Went here during Restaurant Week with a friend and had their special mac and cheese with beef pierogie and pork belly. The meat itself was tender and was cooked perfectly; however their mac n cheese didn't really live up to my expectations. I felt that it was heavy in cream and rosemary, there's not really anything special for that side dish. It did however had well marinated and cooked chicken in the mac n cheese and I think that was the only thing that I enjoyed from that side dish. As far as the dessert goes, \"bacon ice cream\", it was different but it wasn't for me. There were bacon bits after the ice cream melts in your palate and it was salty. Ice cream to me is sweet, not salty. My friend liked it so it could just be a personal choice to make. 

The place is very nice to bring groups of friends, co-workers, etc during lunch hour since its located right on E 4th. Setting is romantic \"candle-light\" but it can get loud since the kitchen is out in the open, so choose a seat that's away. One thing that I really like about the place is their great selection of wines. You can clearly see it displayed when you first walk in. Decor is pretty modern and definitely a place to be seen at."}
{"text":"Chef Michael Simon does not disappoint! Everything about my experience was marvelous. Cannot wait to dine here again when I get down to Ohio."}
{"text":"Exceptional restaurant. We are visiting from Washington DC and were told this was the place to eat. Starting with excellent service, divine lamb shank, Cauliflower appetizer was to die for and topped off with the bacon ice cream dessert. We had one hitch, the salmon was dry, they replaced it promptly and surprised us with the dessert to compensate. Excellent wine choices. Sophisticated decor. Best meal in Cleveland and all our meals were great."}
{"text":"Great service! Although for what we paid and got, it could've been better. I wouldn't NOT recommend this place! Very good!"}
{"text":"Had a fablous girls night! Food and service were flawless. Upscale atmosphere."}
{"text":"Lola really has it all....awesome ambiance, amazing food and excellent service. It's situated right in the heart of downtown Cleveland surrounded by other cool bars and restaurants. I've been to Lolita before so I wanted to try the big sister restaurant, Lola. I was not disappointed. To start we got the bone marrow (served on crackers and garnishes...YES) and pork belly. I got the duck as an entree which was to die for. I love duck...but duck is a hard meat to cook. You can't overcook it or it'll be too tough, but I've been to places that have basically served me a raw slab of meat. Lola had it just right. So tender and flavourful! I stole some pork chop from someone else's plate and that was amazing too. It had that home cooked comfort but beautifully with a fancy flare.  Overall this was a great night out...Lola is an awesome spot for a special night out."}
{"text":"This place has been on my bucket list of places to try and I finally made it here on yesterday for Happy Hour.  I arrived at 5:00 on a Thursday and the bar was filling up fast.  I found a seat and proceeded to order a cocktail.  The Beta was DELICIOUS, ginger infused vodka, with fresh lime, soda water on the rocks.  I also ordered the mac n cheese and of course the brussel sprouts (my favorite veg, right now).  The mac n cheese arrived warm, gooey and delicious.   The tang from the goat cheese was evident, just a hint of rosemary and a nice portion of shredded chicken.  I have to agree with a fellow yelper, this dish need a little more texture.  If Lola presented this dish in some type of crock or small cast iron vessel, topped with buttered bread crumbs for crunch, this would launch this dish into a completely new realm.  I'm guessing that because this was the 1/2 portion Happy Hour version that maybe they don't pull out all of the bells and whistles.   On to the brussel sprouts, one word.....HEAVENLY.  The sprouts were quick fried tossed with walnuts, anchovies and a balsamic reduction.    All in all this was a great Happy Hour meal, especially for $16 including cocktail.  I left Lola full, happy and looking forward to another visit (for dinner!)"}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant!  We sat at the chef's table and were very well taken care of by waitstaff!  We can't wait to come back to Cleveland to come again!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here back in July, and I have to say, Micheal Symon.. doesn't impress me as a TV guy. He may be an Iron Chef, but I've had better. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Lola is horrible, because it was good, just not Iron Chef great. Maybe my expectations were too high. But I guess, for the food selection I saw in Cleveland Ohio, Lola may just be a 5 star worthy joint. The restaurant itself is beautiful I must say. Very modern. I did feel a bit overdressed, I donned a typical dress I would wear to dinner in DC, but Clevelanders were wearing jeans and tops.. which I thought was tacky for such a great looking restaurant owned by an Iron Chef. 

For starters I had the Beef Cheek Peirogie with wild mushrooms and horseradish creme fraiche. It was good, but a bit bland for me, I expected it to be a tad more rich with the creme fraiche. Also for apps I tried the Sweetbreads.. (the thymus gland) it was my first time, and it was very good. Delicious in fact. 

For my entree I had the Duck. It was served perfectly with vegetables, pears and cranberries. The sauce the duck was served with was great, the sides, not noteworthy. My boyfriend ordered the Braised Lamb Shank. I tried it, and thought it was OK. It looked really good served with fennel apple and bacon. It was a bit bland.. Owell. 

Dessert was defiantly my favorite. I had to try the \"6am Special\" it's french toast, topped with maple bacon ice cream .. topped with caramelized apples. Sounds gross? Don't knock it till you try it. It is SO good. I have to admit, although we were sharing, I finished most of it."}
{"text":"Our dinner was good, but you are definitely paying for the name here. There isn't anything especially outstanding about the food. There is something outstanding about the price tag though. I guess everyone has to go once..."}
{"text":"Beet salad = great. Great flavors, beets weren't overwhelming. Trout = excellent. Smoked, hearty fish. Donuts = out of this world. Yum yum, so very tasty. Could go there just for coffee and donuts. Great meal, great service, great experience. Also, loved that the wine menu displayed on an iPad. Great use of technology.  So cool!!!"}
{"text":"We were in town just for a night and chose Lola after having our reservation at L'Albatros cancelled at the 11th hour due to a power outage (!). I think that was a serendipitous occurence, as we had a great meal and loved the atmosphere and vibe of Lola. Excellent cocktails (always a threshold requirement for me), and an interesting selection of appetizers. My bold stepdaughter went with the bone marrow, which was served fried with toast and other accoutrement that made it not just tolerable but enjoyable. The shaved root vegetable and quinoa and kale salads were excellent - the flavors melded perfectly, and neither was your typical, \"oh-this-again\" salad. My stepson had the beef cheek peroigi, which he loved. For entrees, I had the braised pork shank. It was done to tender, fall-off-the-bone perfection. My only quibble was that the spaetzle was totally lost. My husband raved about the trout, thumbs up on the scallops and hangar steak as well.  The only weak point in our meal was the desserts - we tried the 6am Special and the s'more, and neither blew us away. Service was excellent - our waiter was attentive, knowledgeable, candid and funny without being over the top. We told him about a slight onion allergy, and he was quite diligent about guiding us through the best menu options accordingly.  All and all, a great night and a welcome gem in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place considering the price tag and reviews.

It was just ok.  Started out with the pork belly (I've had better).  Ordered the rib eye (good but I've had better).  Ended the meal with a weird bacon ice cream french toast dessert (first time and out was suprisingly good)."}
{"text":"Every time I've been here, the food is delicious. It's definitely worth the money. The service was great. The only thing is the atmosphere is a little loud but I personally don't mind it too much."}
{"text":"Just good.  This establishment suffers from a lack of attention from its chef/ owner.  Although well conceived , the dishes were bland, being under seasoned , and not tossed properly in sauce.  Just poor to middling execution."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the meal. Truthfully, the reviews are so high on Yelp for Lola, that we were a bit disappointed. It was very good, but the food was 4 star at best."}
{"text":"Lola is a great restaurant and dining experience in downtown Cleveland. Had the crispy pig ears and curry shrimp for appetizers, these were excellent, specially the pig ears. The entre was the best, very tender and excellently prepared lamb loin in a wine sauce with wild mushrooms and other garnishes, the best I've had in a while. Fully recommend this restaurant, specially for a date or a special celebration."}
{"text":"Micheal Symon is a IRON chef for a reason. Fresh seasonal food made  into comfort food with a contemporary twist. GREAT every time I've been there. The 6am is the most unique, best tasting desert i have ever had."}
{"text":"Oh Michael Symon I knew I liked you for a reason. Came here when visiting Cleveland for a friend's wedding and the food was ridiculously good (even by Miami standards). We started with the bone marrow but were more blown away the bacon jam that came with it, had to ask for seconds! I got the lamb which was luscious, tender, juicy, and everything you would ever want in a lamb loin. My boyfriend ordered hanger steak which was delicious, but he was disappointed that they had already cut the steak for him. Besides the minor setback, our bellies were full and we were happy people. Michael Symon please bring Lola to Miami !!!"}
{"text":"Just my fifth time here, the quality remains top notch. Had the pork chop entree and it was good. Plenty of seating at the bar. I'd say the prices are reasonable for what you get. Next time I'm in Cleveland I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"Ate at Lola last week for the first time in many years - and was not disappointed.  The braised berkshire \"bacon\" melted in my mouth.  The beef cheek pierogi was excellent (though I missed the lobster pierogi I remembered from college).  We had the scallop entree and the smoked pork chop entree - both were excellent.  And the Lola fries were delicious.  The 6 am special - a dessert featuring pound cake french toast and maple bacon ice cream - was the lone disappointment.  The oil used to fry the pound cake tasted off - far more noticeable than it should have been.

That said, service was excellent.  We originally were seated next to a very loud (possibly bachelorette?) party.  The staff member that filled our water glasses noticed the noise and had the hostess reseat us.  The front dining room is MUCH quieter than the space immediately off the bar - I'd highly recommend requesting it if you want to be able to hear your dining companions in conversation.

Valet parking is cash only ($8)."}
{"text":"Simply amazing. Service, food, atmosphere come together for a memorable experience. For what you get, the pricing is reasonable."}
{"text":"Yum!  Where else can you get pigs ear, pork belly, feta & watermelon to taste THAT good?!  The \"pork chop\" was worth a three hour drive from our hometown to have it again. And again!  The hangar steak tender and tasty.  Maple-Bacon ice cream?  Oh yeah!"}
{"text":"The service was slow and waiter seemed more interested in facebook on his phone than us.  The pierogi appetizer took forever and was cold, we almost left then.  I wish we would have, ordered the hangar steak.  It looked good but it had like a ammonia after taste, I wouldn't have given it to my dog in fear of him getting poisoned.  Stay away from this over priced place, just another fake TV personality.  I'm sure this guy will be selling pans, mixers and recipes book on infomercials soon. Stay tuned.  I just got threatened by a goon from this place, I hope my review will hopefully help this establishment improve. The only thing I can do is give this place another chance the next time I am up there. I am not the only one with issues with their visit."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic.  Had the pierogies and the seasonal lamb shank with mint and pickled radish.  Really fantastic stuff.  I dropped a star only because I was shooing fruit flies away from my seat at the bar all night.  It was kind of annoying and not what you expect from fine dining.  Otherwise a great experience."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure how one really explains Lola. There are not enough positive adjectives in the English language to express how exquisite dining there is. We had the most attentive,descriptive and helpful server (I wish I could remember his name to give him a shout out.) He had the best recommendations and took his time to make sure we were 100% satisfied. After reading other reviews, I knew we had to order the pirogi for an app and we were so happy we did. It was bursting with flavor and a perfect start to a fabulous meal.  After being torn between multiple entrees (everything sounded so good) both my fiancee and I ordered the hanger steak. PURE HEAVEN. If you prefer more of a rare steak, this is the dish for you. It came with fries which 1 order was enough for 2. I couldn't stop eating them. Even though by the end of dinner we both were bursting at the seems, we just couldn't help but order dessert. We went with the breakfast flavored dessert ( the name escapes me) and don't think about it- just order.  I can't wait to have another reason to go back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! When we found ourselves in Cleveland for the night, I knew I wanted to try Lola. There was nothing about the meal and experience that did not impress us. Our waiter, Brian B., was absolutely top notch (and we made sure to let his manager know what a great job he was doing). He went out of his way to make a list of places where we could try some other local Cleveland brews after we tried all of the local ales on their menu. He even brought over a sample of some locally made bourbon after my boyfriend had mentioned that I liked bourbon. 

Beside the service, the food was out of this world. I wish we had gotten more than two pierogies for our appetizer, but it was actually a good size for a starter.... just a few bites to get the appetite going. The flavor was perfect! 

For our entrees, we got the ribeye and the hangar steak. The ribeye had the most perfect crust, and melty fat. Not a little bit of it went to waste. The hangar steak was tender and super flavorful. I just can't say enough about a wonderful experience and even better food. Without question, this was the best service I've ever gotten in any restaurant. I loved it!"}
{"text":"Get the bone marrow and a tasty cocktail...you will thank me.  The bar is lovely, intimate, and relaxing.  I thoroughly enjoyed my visit."}
{"text":"Went to Lola again a few more times for a more casual lunch.  

The Lola burger is very good and the atmosphere can't be better.  Sitting at the bar is a very different vibe than dining at the tables, but it is nice to have great food in a much more relaxed pace."}
{"text":"Ok

I had the beef cheek perogies... shrug
I had the duck entree... it was good

I had that stupid bacon ice cream with french toast dessert.... OH MY GOD!

I'll go back here.  For sure.
I wasn't too wowed by our appetizer or entrees... but I was by the dessert

So yeah.

Pretty piss poor service though.  I felt like we were being ignored most of the night.  The server simply wasn't accessible.... or attentive.... or friendly

Oh but that stupid dessert... it was soooo good!"}
{"text":"There were a few stand-out dishes, but overall, nothing special.

Highlights for us were the pork belly appetizer and the polenta that came with the porkchop. The hanger steak, pork chops, and charcuterie plate were all just okay--good, but nothing amazing that couldn't be found at most upscale restaurants. Portion sizes were large. Dessert was hot chocolate and donuts, but the dish just tasted like Krispy Kremes with a little lime zest.

The staff wasn't great. The hostess didn't even acknolwedge us when we arrived, but just grabbed some menus and expected us to follow. The waitress seemed bothered when we asked for recommendations. 

Decent food but nothing about the place that really made it special. No interesting flavor combinations and a staff who seemed to care less about the food they served. Lola should spent less time on its ambviance and more time training its staff and serving higher quality dishes."}
{"text":"I'm just gonna keep this very simple and short. Michael Symon is a food genius. I have been to all 3 of his restaurants and NEVER have I been disappointed. Lola is MUST!!!!! A meal I will never forget!"}
{"text":"As a kid, the City of Cleveland was ripe material for every stand-up comic in America. The City's economy was in shambles, the sports teams sucked and Lake Erie was so filthy it was lit on fire once a year. But let me tell you something my faithful readers. When it comes to food, Cleveland is no joke. This City is a foodies wet dream. I dined at some wonderful eateries on my recent trip to the City on the Cuyahoga. But Lola topped them all. 

 Chef Michael Symon has put his own spin on American Cuisine, and I'm here to tell you first hand....Its delicious. Lets start out with the drinks. I ordered a bourbon and water. Not that I'm complaining, but it was all bourbon. About 12 ounces of it. I would hate to see size of a double. There's nothing like preparing for a big meal with a belly full of Bourbon. We were lucky enough to sit at the Chef's table which was a nice touch. I love watching a well run kitchen at work. There was one recommendation we received from everybody in the kitchen. ORDER THE BONE MARROW!!!!!!. Well heck....you don't have to tell me twice. Thank God we took their advice. I've ordered this decadent appetizer before, but it was never served like this. The marrow is served out of the bone and seared on the outside. It's served with bread and three different sauces. The sauces were not needed. The marrow tasted like the most delicious and decadent pork rind you could ever imagine. Utterly amazing! 

 For my entree, I opted for the beef, hanger steak served with pickle sauce and chilies. The meat was under the table-knocking good. The dish was beautifully  presented and mouth watering. 

 Here's the five star bottom line: If you are in Cleveland for more than a day and don't dine at Lola, you're an idiot. And no! I'm not joking. The quality of food, service and atmosphere are top notch. Not only that, its affordable. You would pay twice the price for a meal of this quality in Chicago or NYC. Lola ranks near the top of the best restaurants I've ever visited."}
{"text":"I hate to be repetitive but Lola was great.  The pierogies were so different.  Hubby had pork chop and I had the hanger steak with the fries.  both delicious and tender.  I loved the  fries -crispy, well salted and rosemary is always a great touch.  The portion was huge, which is surprising for a restaurant like this.  The finishing touch was the 6AM special.  Although I love me some bacon, bacon ice cream scared me a little.  What a PERFECT combination.  I wanted another one right after I finished.  The whole meal was fantastic and service was very good.  PS-Grapefruit ginger gimlet was also great.  Husband loved the \"Hot and Dirty\" martini."}
{"text":"I've come here for lunch a couple times; it's all right. Really wanted to LOVE it, because I really admire what Michael Symon is trying to do for Cleveland (plus I love his laugh!), but this place didn't really work me up. Maybe it's because I came here for work. Admittedly, Lola is probably one of the best places in Cleveland, but I didn't find it to be particularly memorable."}
{"text":"The cuisine is superb. The bar is wonderful. The drinks are terrific. The staff are excellent. What else could you want in Cleveland Ohio"}
{"text":"While in Cleveland I felt we had to have dinner here. This place is on the higher end of dining options in the city, but worth it. We came in pretty early so it was not very crowded yet. The music was good, classic rock, and the ambiance romantic. We started out with the house made charcuterie plate. It was later than I was expecting with a variety of sausages, pate and pickles. Then we had the \"fish and chips\" which is not what you would expect. It was more like a tuna poke except more Greek. I had the scallops for dinner which were awesome! The hubs had the strip steak. I am not a huge steak fan, but it was tasty, especially the seasoning on the outside. Then for dessert we split the \"s'mores\". It was very good and unexpected. It had homemade bourbon marshmallows that had been torched on top of a creamy chocolate ganache and graham cracker ice cream. So in one bite it tasted like a s'more but the temperature difference of the ice cream was cool. They also have a nice sized wine list, cocktails and beer. The service was exemplary as well. Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"Here's a review that will inevitably be filtered.

Dragged here for lunch recently with some co-workers.  I came in here with a bad attitude as my last visit here featured stray hairs on a starter dish...but figure, hey give them a second shot.

Ended up having the Lola burger.  Nothing but pure arrogance on the chef's part assuming that English muffin, burger, bacon, cheddar and special sauce go together.  We get it, they put rosemary on fries.

How about their ketchup?  We had four diners at the table (each with fries), and only one server asks if we'd like ketchup.  Then ends up bringing two tiny ketchup tins for the whole table.  One with house cajun spice ketchup, another with regular ketchup.

The ketchup incident resonated through the rest of the lunch service, with slow refills and no other attentiveness.

The servers didn't even present dessert options."}
{"text":"I had the pork chop, which was dry, bland and entirely underwhelming. Is everything on the menu here so blah? Maybe I chose poorly, but I expected more flavor. At least it was plentiful. The charred carrots were good, too. Service was excellent. I think maybe winning a James Beard award can be a curse as much as a blessing as a restaurant ages and becomes complacent. Or maybe they are just trying to appeal to the local tastebuds?"}
{"text":"First time trying this place and trust me I will be back. The food fell off the bone, the appetizers were delicious. The staff was super sweet and helpful. I had the lamb and I couldn't finish it so I took it home, the hubby had the hanger steak which was equally good and we had scallops as a appetizer. I was celebrating my birthday so at the end they brought me this adorable plate that wished me a happy birthday and a small cupcake, which was also delicious."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed. Based on the yelp reviews and Michael Symons reputation I had high hopes but was let down. The beef cheek perogies were excellent - the meat was tender, the sauce was delicious. The rest of the meal, however, fell flat for me. I had the steak which was cooked medium rare instead of the medium I asked for (which luckily I was ok with but it was the point of not making it how it was ordered). It was also colder than should have been. I liked the peppers, onions and sauce on top. The fries were totally average. Also there was no duck as an entree on the menu.  My restaurant companions ordered the scallops (totally average - not very flavorful but cooked well) and pork chop (the polenta was the star; the pork chop was average). For dessert we had the peanut brittle crunch - again average. Honestly next time I'm back in Cleveland I will go to Crop for an overall much better meal."}
{"text":"Made it a point to stop over here for dinner on our way to NYC. We were given excellent service, some freebies and everything was great - except the homemade pasta, which was soggy. I will not hold that against them, though as everything else was just outstanding. M. Symon was not cooking, but his executive chef did a fantastic job and the restaurant manager made sure everything was on point. I recommend you stick with the meat dishes and the signature pirogies..."}
{"text":"Picture this.  It's a Saturday in high summer.  I've swept my BFF away from her husband and two young children for a concert at the Q.  She had an armful of recommendations by people she knew, and I had been slavishly checking Yelp. We both agreed that Lola's was worth a go, but what to do when all tables were booked when she called up a few days ahead?  We decided to cool our heels at another bar a few doors down before I caught a good buzz off of my whiskey sour and got the wherewithall to slip over to Lola's and ask if there was any possibility they could slip us in.  Success!  The hostesses were very nice about it and took my name, so I dashed back to the other bar, collected my friend (after we paid our tab, of course...we aren't shady ladies), and came back to get seated.

Now, I must admit that I wasn't prepared for the fanciness.  Thankfully, we were both dressed for the occasion, but I just didn't realize it was as high-fallutin' as it was until we checked out the menu and I saw the likes of \"bone marrow\".  I looked around and saw everyone from couples on a date to group dinners to gal pals like us.  The atmosphere was rather dark, but not distractingly so.  They have an open kitchen that you can be seated near to watch the action.  Overall I'd say the atmosphere was hip without being hipster (there is a difference), and definitely a place for grown-ups.

My friend got the steak and fries with a light beer (can't take the Pittsburgh out of a girl even when she's in Cleveland, I guess), and I the scallops and a couple of cocktails.  We shared the fries that came with her meal--which totally had me at \"duck fat\"--and I don't think we even finished them because there were so many.  I had a piece of her steak, she one or two of my scallops, and life was perfect.  Nothing like date night with your best friend of almost 20 years when you're finally old enough to afford something fancier than TGI Fridays.  We finished our perfect meal with desserts.  I can't remember what mine was called exactly,but it had some pretty flashy stuff like \"milk foam\" (not the cappuccino kind, but the molecular gastronomy fancy kind) and a blondie brownie involved...it was delightful.  Our server was on point too.  I would have no qualms about coming back here any  time."}
{"text":"Lola is definitely what everyone makes it out to be- fancy, delicious, overpriced, and a way to treat yourself. I've gone when family was in town and it's a nice place that shows that Cleveland has some cool things to offer. This is one of Michael Symon's restaurants, so the food choices were obviously exquisite, rich, and interesting.
This isn't the kind of place that you can just get a delicious burger.. you'll end up with something more classy/exotic than that.

The dessert was really great though, and the cocktails definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"Go big or go home!

It was a beautiful evening so we opted for out on the patio.  

Cocktails:
O.M.G.
Slinger
Margarita
Pinot Noir for dinner: We turned over the iPad to our IT husbands and we ended up with a smooth, lighter-bodied pinot.

Started:
Beef cheek pierogi-My hubby is Polish and I've spent some afternoons making homemade pierogi. I would classify it as an \"artisan\" pierogi. It was very delish, but I was slightly underwhelmed.
Crudo-This was my fav, it was very light and fresh. 
Oysters-I normally do a little lemon and hot sauce, so being served with mignonette forced me to switch it up and I'm glad I did. It added a subtle addition to the oysters. 

Entrees:
Sturgeon-Hubby ordered and he enjoyed
Scallops-I'm predictable, but I rarely meet a scallop I don't like and they were the best I've had. Perfectly seared! I really like the leek as a compliment.
Halibut-I'm still thinking of the celery root puree that accompanied. 
Hanger Steak-I didn't get a taste, but I did try the delicious rosemary frites. A good french fry can't be beat and these were perfection.

Desserts:
Sesame Ganache-The ganache was decadent and I really enjoyed the sesame disk that accompanied.
Black Forest Cake-My hubby's wide-eyed comment was, \"Can someone take this back to the kitchen and construct a piece a cake?\" He likes steak house style desserts or something a little more substantial. The individual parts were delicious and the cherries were super boozy (not complaining)!

Our waiter recommended a cherry beer to accompany dessert and it was delicious. Less sweet than a lambic and a great way to close our meal."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Lola last week for her birthday and were very happy with the experience.  The food was amazing -- especially the pork belly with pig's ear; however, it was really nice to interact with staff that seemed to honestly enjoy working there.  Our server, Chris, gets top marks for his friendliness, knowledge, and enthusiasm.  One side note -- I personally loved the tablet based wine and spirits menu, and thought browsing the selections and getting extra information was neat; however, a table near us really did not like that there wasn't a paper version."}
{"text":"This place was recommended for dinner in Cleveland. Great ambience and lighting. I had the pork chops which were perfect. I also had the 6am special which was great! I highly recommend this place & I will be back. Great drinks as well."}
{"text":"Julie

A very nice experience from the Iron Chef....  I'm not a big fan of food shows except man vs food, Zimmerman and Bourdain, so I honestly didn't even know who Michael Symon was...  But heck I was in Cleveland and this was the place to go.

Had a spot at the chefs table which was a nice experience.  It's a lighted table right next to the kitchen where all the action occurs.  The chefs were quite busy and I realized watching these guys go entree after entree without a break, how happy I am not to be them...

On to the food.  Started with a very refreshing arugula salad that included eggs, feta cheese and mint..  Nothing spectacular but it was just what I felt like having...    Entree was the Berkshire Pork Chops done medium accompanied with chiles, cheesy polenta and bbq onions.  It was... wait for it .... delicious....  The pork chop was tender and cooked to juicy perfection.  polenta and onions where the perfect sides to the dish.  Very satisfying and highly recommended.

For dessert, I had the mango parfait.  All their desserts seem quite unique.  This one was made with mango, lime, cashew, cilantro, and a caramelized banana.  It was good.  Nothing over the top... just good.  The wait staff was helpful and attentive and overall experience with service was excellent.  It's just nice when everyone in your party is served simultaneously... A little thing but so important."}
{"text":"Took a trip to Cleveland to add a another ballpark to the list (Twins won) and made sure to make reservations.  We had a table for 2 at 9 PM.  We arrived about 5 minutes early and were seated immediately.

The space is dark and elegant. A well stocked wine rack behind the bar bodes well for those that enjoy wine.  The tables are covered in linens with cloth napkins and glassware that is superb.  If any criticism can be made, it certainly would be about the silverware.  The handles are round and are difficult to use.  This is not the best for restaurant use.  

We started with the charcuterie platter.  Duck speck, beef pepperoni, salami, another sausage that I can't remember and La  Quercia prosciutto.  With the exception of the prosciutto everything was house made.  Perfectly accompanied with coarse mustard and cornichons.  With the exception of the La Quercia everything was fantastic.  First time trying the La Quercia, and wasn't really impressed. 

I got the beef cheek perrioge and my dining partner tried the seasonal root salad.  The beef cheek was amazing, served with a delicious horseradish sauce.  They were cooked perfectly and topped with sauteed mushrooms of various kinds.  The salad got rave reviews (although I did not personally try it) and we enjoyed it all with a nice dry perseco.

For entree I got the lamb 3 way and my dining partner got the Cleveland Clambake.  To go with this the general manager suggested a rose and it was spot on delicious.

The lamb came as a chop, sausage and sweetbreads.  The chop was cooked perfectly - slight under medium, and caramelized, almost crispy on the outside.  The sweetbreads were simply breaded and cooked until golden, crispy and fabulous.  The sausage was wonderful, although I'm not a huge fan sweet paprika.  It was served with a light arugula salad and some olives and baby tomato.  All done to perfection.

The clambake was a perfectly cooked piece of walleye that still had its skin.  It was served with clams and potato and corn in a broth.  Local, seasonal, and perfect.

For dessert we got a simple cheese plate.  It was presented the traditional way, and is pretty hard to screw up.  Everything else on the dessert menu (which we spied in the close, but comfortable quarters) certainly looked amazing and judging by the looks on the faces we saw, were spot on.

Price wise, from a Chicago point of view, the food here is priced right on.   Quality wise, and also in terms of the craftsmanship that goes into the creation of the dishes, Lola does not disappoint and is well worth the trip. (Just don't stay at the Radisson, but that will be another review!)

Would love to go back, and would, if it was in Chicago.  Hey Michael, why not branch out a little west?"}
{"text":"Terrible service, okay food, over priced.  dont go here if youre looking for an experience better than panera bread"}
{"text":"I never have a bad meal at Lola for lunch or dinner.  I can't say anything about the food that hasn't been said here already.  It's delicious.  Service is always great.  At lunch, it's quick and attentive--perfect for an hour lunch break.  For dinner, it's attentive, yet slower paced and more relaxed.  This isn't a place that forces fast turn times on the customer, and that's great!  I do not want them to speed up the experience or make things feel rushed.  That's not to say the food takes forever--they get the food out quick and at a good pace, but the service doesn't rush the guests.  For that reason, this is the perfect place for an intimate dinner date or for someone who likes to slowly taste and experience the great food.  However, if you want to accelerate the process, the servers are attentive enough to pick up the pace."}
{"text":"OMG is this place wonderful!!!

I grew up in Cleveland but have not lived there since Michael Symon became its celebrity chef, so I was excited to try Lola. My family took my mom there for a pre-Tribe-game birthday dinner. We added an extra person to our reservation at the last minute, and the hostess was very nice about it.

We had drinks at the bar and found the bartenders to be really friendly. Then we were seated by the front window for dinner, which might just be the best spot in Cleveland for people-watching.

I ordered the pork, and it was the best pork dish I've had in my life. The serving was HUGE and everything about it was perfectly delicious. The meat was juicy and the sweet carmelized onion and cheesy polenta made every bite a perfect one. I can't remember what everyone else had, but I do remember that they all loved what they ordered.

Congrats to Michael Symon for opening a world-class restaurant in good old Cleveland. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Cleveland born-and-raised Michael Symon has been my favorite Iron Chef for years, so obviously when we ended up moving here I wanted to visit all of his restaurants.  We decided to go for a somewhat impromptu date night, and surprisingly were able to get a reservation on OpenTable early on a Friday evening.  The atmosphere is classy (there's a coat check) but not stuffy.  It feels modern, is dark enough to have ambiance but not too dark to see the menu, and the wall of wine is very cool.  The wine and drink menu is on a tablet, with a handy app that lets you save what you've picked for when your server comes back, helpfully eliminating that \"oh crap, that tequila drink I saw several pages ago looked awesome\" problem.  Our service was Cleveland-nice and professional throughout the evening, with helpful recommendations.

We had:
--Drinks: my husband really enjoyed an aviation cocktail, and I really liked the citrus citrus margarita.  The wine list has a lot of options, and we were both able to find a glass of something we wanted with our entree.  For dessert, they have a large selection of after-dinner drinks, as well as coffee and espresso.
--Salad: let it be known I ate broccoli on purpose for the first time in my entire life and actually enjoyed it.  I'm not sure if I'm actually converted, but the cruciferous salad is to die for.
--Soup: they had a special white bean soup made with ham stock and bacon, and this was definitely the best bean soup I've ever had (sorry Mom).  They let us split both the salad and the soup which was really nice, because we were able to try more things and not be too stuffed to enjoy the rest of our meal.
--Strip Loin: my husband ordered this medium rare and while the pepper crust was a little too charred for his liking he said the meat was very, very good.
--Smoked Pork Chop:  this was really delicious-- just the right amount of smoke flavor and the meat was really tender.  The polenta it came with was perfection.
--Dessert: my husband talked me out of my usual chocolate go-tos and into the \"Sweet Mess.\"  This turned out to be a really good idea, because the panna cotta-like base of it was excellent and when mixed with the meringue and fruit it all came together really well.  And for a \"mess,\" it was pretty to look at!  He had one of the chocolate options and finished it, so it must have been good.

This brings us to 3 wins in 3 visits to Michael Symon's restaurants so far (a trip to Mabel's still forthcoming).  New York might think it's the culinary capital of America, but with places like this Ohio more than holds its own."}
{"text":"Excellent peroigi! The chicken was too salty. Standard tasting scallops. We had the best seat in the house with a full view of the kitchen and looking out over the other diners.  I really did like Lola.  I do, however, wish the waitress had not said the hostess who seated us was \"brain dead.\"  Made her less appealing tip wise..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. Loved the food, the staff was great. Try the Lola fries they are amazing. Will return next time I am in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Wow I had heard great things about this place and was highly disappointed.

The good: the atmosphere and ambience was nice. I liked that it had an open kitchen and the wall decor was nice.  

The bad: the service was horrible.  The only thing that went right with it was that they keep the water coming.  Our waiter barely acknowledged  us and seemed to bothered to be serving us.  I thought maybe he was having a bad day but as I watched him with a few other tables he was engaging, laughing with them and checking in on them. After we ordered our appetizer I didn't see him again for 40 minutes.  Other people stopped by and filled our water.  It took 40 minutes for our appetizer to arrive.  At no time did he stop by to give us an update and at least three other tables were seated, served food and paid. Two in his section. 

Finally the appetizers arrived and I was under whelmed.  The pirogies were just ok. The meat filling was nice but the contrast with the sauce was too sweet in nature.  The seasonal soup had a nice texture but lacked any depth of flavor. In addition the server did not describe the soup right at all.  He said there was lobster in it but there was none. Instead there was bacon. Which is ok cause I love bacon. 

After still waiting another 25 minutes for the entrees I flagged the waiter down and ask about the food. He barely stopped on his was and just dismissed me with a \"oh it will just be a minute\".   Ten minutes later the food arrived, at this point I was just done and wanted to eat the food and go.  The pork schnitzel was pretty good. It had a good breeding and was cooked well and still had good moisture to it.  

I do not mind waiting if the waiter is at least communicating with me about what is going on especially when the food is taking a long time. 

I will not be returning and will not be recommending this place at all to any one."}
{"text":"Amazing. We had a reservation, but arrived early and decided to have a drink at the bar. The bartenders were so friendly and helpful that we decided to dine there! The wine list was so extensive that we were a bit overwhelmed. No worries! The bartender sent over the Lola wine steward to assist. He helped us fine tune our choice! the food was amazing, from the appetizer to our main dish, the flavors were perfectly balanced. In the end, I bought an autographed cookbook. Perfect birthday dinner."}
{"text":"4.5. Delicious food. Very good service. Never rushed. 
Came for restaurant week, add the wine pairing to our meal. A fabulous evening. 
The beef cheek pierogi was excellent; surprisingly rich and delicate."}
{"text":"Went to Lola for a business meal. Ordered three course. Salad is ok. Loved my scallops and my desert. The only downside is the price (I am lucky that my employer paid for it; however, i was aware it was a little bit expensive)."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Great food!  Great service!  We had the hanger steak and pork chops. Amazing!  Wonderful way to spend our last night in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Honestly - somewhat underwhelmed.  This was the second time I have eaten here - all on the basis of strong foodie recommendations but found the place left me kind of blasé....  Got off on the wrong foot with a +20 minute wait at the table before anyone even offered service...  Decided upon a selection of small plates - which were good (not astounding) - but the matching glasses of wine were expensive and overpriced....  Next time in Cleveland I'm trying a new place...."}
{"text":"Best restaurant I've ever stepped foot into in my life. I was always skeptical that good food could be elevated to a higher level with new tastes but boy did Lola deliver. If you ever visit Cleveland you have to come here."}
{"text":"Exceptional, particularly for Cleveland service. 

Had 9:30PM reservations for 3 last night with some friends of mine. From the halibut to the scallops & potatoes & roasted corn soup...everything was tasty, savory, flavorful...I could find more words if you really need them. 

Drinks were a little out of the ordinary and tasty as well.  From what I discerned a well stocked bear and wine list was also available. 

I had heard complaints about the pre main course bread...again on the mark this evening...it was warm, slightly crusty and went great with the butter as a good bread should do.

For dessert...a little cleanse of the palate...strawberry-apricot sorbet and some chocolat deliciousness. 

Well done Lolita, and I do not mean overcooked!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on Sunday evening after the Valentine's weekend. My review for the dining experience at Lola are as follow. 

Overall rating: 4.5

Place: 5 stars
The restaurant has an open kitchen which is pretty cool to see people cooking. The ambiance of the restaurant is also romantic. It is very good for dating or special event celebration. The wine wall behind the bar is also unique and add interestingness to the place. The restaurant area and bathroom are clean. 

Service: 5 stars
The service is probably one of the most impressive thing I had at my dinner tonight at Lola. The staffs are very friendly and polite. Everyone works with full energy, eagerness, and very efficient. The water and wine are always refilled. Empty plates are always removed instantly. Everything about staff and service here are very impressive.

Food: 3.5 stars

1) Waiting time: 2 stars
The reason that I rate food with 3.5 stars came mainly from the significantly long waiting time for food. We were at the restaurant at 5:30 pm on Sunday night and it was not busy at all, especially when comparing with what it will be on Friday and Saturday night. There were about five or six tables around us. An hour later, no one still get their food. I really don't know what really happened in the kitchen. The time we waited for food probably the main reason that we didn't rate Lola 5 stars as it should be.

2) Food itself: 5 stars
We ordered Roasted Squash salad, Braised Lamp Shank, Pork chop, Roasted Brussel sprout, and the 6 am special for dessert. Everything was amazing. The roasted squash was probably my least favorite plate. It was just too sweet for me. But, overall, the food were superb. Pork chop and Lamp shank were hand down. We were very happy with the food.

Overall, I think Lola is still a great place for a special event. It was not cheap for sure. We spent almost $200 for our dinner. But, we were overall satisfied with food and service. We hope that the today's kitchen issue was just untypical and not lasting. We look forward to come back here again."}
{"text":"Michael Symon's very chic restaurant in downtown Cleveland lived up to all the hype. We started out with the Beef Cheek Pierogi and Bone Marrow. Both dishes looked extremely elegant but their looks were outclassed by their superior flavors. The pierogi had just the right amount of horseradish to give the smooth, velvety beef cheek a little kick. For entrees, we went with the Sturgeon and the Scallops. First time I ever had Sturgeon so it's difficult to compare but this dish will be difficult to beat. The smoked mussels and the chorizo added to the delectable, sweet sauce over the sea scallops. They also have one of the biggest wine cellars I've ever seen. Attention to detail is definitely not missed as they allow their wines to breathe by serving them in a decanter."}
{"text":"Places to visit if you only have a few days in Cleveland: (1) Rock HOF (2) Cleveland Museum of Art (3) West side Market and (4) This restaurant.

In Cleveland, the one thing we do best is... lose at major league sports. However, what we do even better is drink and dine like champions. Lola is at the forefront of the Cleveland Culinary scene along with the Zack Bruell, Douglas Katz and Jonathon Sawyer restaurants. Michael Symon brought in the first championship this city has seen in a long time, by winning the Next Iron Chef competition in 2007.

I've been here a dozen times or more so can't believe I'm just writing this now. I take out-of-town guests here, if they are guests that I like. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. In my opinion though, he does meat best. Notable dishes: beef cheek pierogy, crispy pig ear, roasted bone marrow, pork chops, and rib eye steak are all very good eats. Last but not the least, get the 9AM special for dessert, which, in and of itself, deserves it's own landmark."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch and stayed for the atmosphere. I don't know if it's weird to talk about how amazing the French fries were at this classy top rated restaurant but I'm going to do it anyway. We went in around 1 and were waited on right away. The two for $20 lunch menu is honestly the best deal. I has the turkey sandwich and it was fabulous. There were pear slices in the sandwich, yes actual slices o' pear. Moral of the story... You should go it an affordable luxury you can't pass up."}
{"text":"I stopped into Lola while in Cleveland for work.  I was promptly greeted the hostess.  I decided to eat at the bar.  You get to order our cocktail from an ipad.  I appreciate being able to see what my drink will look like before I order it.  I tried two cocktails, both of which I cannot remember the names.  They were both delicious, though.  I had the beef cheek pierogi.  I loved it!  I wish it had come with just a little more mushrooms.  I was going to order an entree, but the beef cheek was a pretty decent size and not exactly a light appetizer. I would service at the bar was prompt.  I would recommend!"}
{"text":"I was really surprised to see so many five-star ratings, since my experience with the food was just okay.  And after reading a little further, I realized that this place is owned by an Iron Chef and that some reviewers actually came here because of that.  Well, for me, eating here was completely by chance, as part of my business trip in the area, with no prior knowledge of the owner.  I ordered the smoked beef brisket sandwich for lunch and thought it was just okay (a bit dry), definitely not the best I've had.  The restaurant is neatly contemporarily decorated, and seeing the operations happening in the open kitchen was an interesting experience."}
{"text":"This place was really hopping for a Monday evening.  This is Iron Chef Michael Symon's signature location, and it is popular and we found well earned.   Wife had beet salad and the beef cheek pierogi for her dinner.  The pierogi were rich, and nicely flavored with a light touch of horseradish.  I had the Smoked Hampshire bone-in pork chop. It was very generous, more like prime rib cuts than pork chop, and wow, it was good.  It was placed atop a mildly cheesy polenta that complimented it perfectly.   It was right up there amongst the best pork chops ever, along with Emeril's (Orlando) and Perry's Steakhouse (Houston).   We were really impressed with Lola's preparation and flavors, and the experience was worth the premium pricing.  As far as parking, it's impossible on the limited street parking in the congested area, so just valet for $8 after restaurant validation."}
{"text":"Lola's ribeye steak is my favorite steak on earth, well within the US. Their scallop dish is magnificent too. How rare is that? They excel your expectation both in meat and seafood. While the ribeye is the best, their scallop is the best too. Trust me, I grew up eating seafood everyday in a city by the coast, I am very picky when it comes to seafood quality. Their oysters are fresh too. I really admire Michael Symon's criativity and passion for food."}
{"text":"My friend and I were in Cleveland for a few days and we got a chance to sample the restaurants on E. 4th Street. What a treat! Lola's was very nice-we were seated immediately and drinks came shortly after. We both enjoyed our meals-I had the scallops-i don't remember what my friend ordered. The staff was very accommodating and when I return to Cleveland, I will make this a stop. Our waiter, Brian, was very helpful in suggesting other places to eat while we were in Cleveland being we were from out of town."}
{"text":"Hearing that this was a celebrity Chef's place I was skeptical to how good it would be after being disappointed by other celebrity chefs places. 

Very surprised and very happy!

One of the best dining experiences I have ever had!

Food great and service to match!  Cool decor without feeling stuffy. 

I could go on and on but all 7 of our group raved about everything. That is a tough feat.  We have all dined at world class venues and this one is surely at the top for me. 

I personally can say the Beef Cheek Periogi, Duck breast, and the bacon-maple desert were all very unique and very good. 

I can highly recommend Lola!  I think you will agree. 

FYI, I am not easily impressed....I love this place....it's the total package - service, food, and ambiance!"}
{"text":"Loving all things Food Network, I was pretty excited about going to Michael Symon's most popular restaurant. I think even DH was excited over this one!! You know that one hit movie that comes out, the one that everyone loves and talks about it to no end until you finally go see it and somewhere in the back of your mind you keep waiting for it to blow you away, only it doesn't? Thankfully, that's *not* what happened at Lola. :) It did, in fact, live up to the hype, I'm so happy to say!! We were seated promptly at the time of our reservation. The first table we were seated at was extremely close to the group of 4 next to it, so we asked for a more private table, which was gladly given. Our waiter was very down to earth and had worked with Michael Symon for a long time. In fact he referred to him as Mike several times and said that before Food Network he was simply Mike. I loved the vibe of the place - sleek and sophisticated without trying too hard. The noise level was good, and the open kitchen was perfect for the setting - although we weren't close enough to actually see a lot of what was happening. We decided to split an appetizer - and we opted for the Berkshire bacon. The waiter was kind enough to split it so it came out on two dishes. It was heavenly and the salad that came on top of it was the perfect blend of crunch and citrus. I seriously wanted to lick the sauce from the plate. I love scallops and ordered those with a side of grilled aspargus. Without a doubt, the best scallops ever. The sear was perfect. The soy broth excellent, the salad atop the scallops the perfect contrast of crunch. The asparagus was grilled perfectly and DH kept saying just one more as he would steal it off of the plate. DH opted for the pork chop (which he loved and a few times I was afraid he was going to pick up the bone and start gnawing it) and a side of the Lola fries. Which I fell in love with. They were my dessert. I couldn't stop eating them. Although I was looking forward to the 6 am special, I seriously could not eat another bite. The only down side was our waiter. At first I thought he was simply one who doesn't hover or come on too strong, but when I went about 15 minutes with an empty drink glass I was slightly disappointed. Why was this meal amazing? The scallops (perfect), the feel - not pretentious in the least. It really gives you an idea of who Michael Symon is. I see now why Clevelanders are so proud of him, as they should be."}
{"text":"Meh...It was just ok. I ate at the bar and had beyond excellent service, I wish the food was as good. I had  the scallop ceviche for an appetizer. The scallops were delicious but had too much salt and not enough acid. Sad face. I had the hanger steak with rosemary fries. Again meh... Hanger steak itself was delicious but a little too done to be called medium rare. Again, not the most flavorful dish."}
{"text":"Lola is located on East 4th St. which is loaded with other restaurants and bars.  After spending a week in Cleveland I decided to give Lola a try on my final night as a kind of last hurrah on my business trip.  The place is a bit more upscale than the surrounding establishments and of course a bit pricer too.  The ambiance and staff attitude definitely met my expectations.

The food and drink selection is more than adequate especially if you are a wine drinker.  I had steak for dinner which was seasoned and cooked to perfection.  This is the type of restaurant I would trust to cook a meal that requires proper technique and special attention to detail.  My hat comes off to the chef that cooked my steak as well as the rest of the staff.  Next time I am in Cleveland I will be paying Lola a visit."}
{"text":"Wow. Just, wow. Really well thought out flavors and textures. Supremely executed. Ordered the calves heart entree, cooked as recommended (medium rare). What an amazing experience -- the texture, the mild but savory flavor paired perfectly with the other elements of the dish. Also tried the pork chop, which was two inches thick, moist and tender and full of flavor, which went fabulously well with the most delicious and creamy polenta I've ever tasted. Bursts of flavor from other elements perfected the dish. Carrot cake for dessert served with cream cheese ice cream -- a perfectly sized, small yet satisfying, portion. Wine list is extensive and recommendations by the server were spot on and perfectly paired with the food. Service is top notch. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place will knock your socks off! Pricey and worth it, it lives up to legend that is Michael Simon. Posh, classy, sexy both in food and in appearance, makes for a great night out. Special occasion, or just a foodie, doesn't matter, this place is made to impress!"}
{"text":"We went to Lola last night for my man's birthday, and it was one of (if not THE) best restaurant experiences we've ever had. The service was wonderful from the moment we walked in--we were sat at the bar while our table was prepared, and the bartender and another employee (waiter? sommelier? off duty bartender) helped us choose a delicious new bourbon to try. (Thank you AJ & Nolan!).  We quizzed our server for ages about the different appetizers, and she was wonderfully patient, informative, and  so helpful (Thank you Gina!).

We ordered the deep fried bone marrow and the beef cheek pirogi for our appetizers. It was our first time having bone marrow and it was one of the best things I've ever eaten.  The server was again just fantastic, telling us different ways to try it with the accompaniments, even doing a bit of a demonstration on request.  The beef cheek pirogi was very, very good but paled in comparison to the bone marrow--not that it was lacking, the bone marrow was just that delightful. 

Then, we were surprised with another treat! We'd been torn about getting the beef cheek pirogi or the pig ear/pork belly appetizer, which our server recommended--she brought us out a complementary order of it! 

We were boxing up nearly as much as we ate, but only because we didn't want to run out of room for the main courses. He had the beef hangar steak, which is his favorite, and it was fantastic. I had the ribeye, first time trying it at Lola, and it was also  very, very nice.  I will say I've probably had slightly better steaks at higher end steakhouses, but that's probably more my preference for a steak that's just seasoned with salt, pepper, and butter--not to say the Lola ribeye wasn't fantastic, I just think that the cut of meat was so good it's almost a shame to dress it up that much.  

Needless to say we were too full for dessert, but... we ordered it anyway. At this point we trusted our server entirely so we let her choose for us, and we had the 6 AM special (split). Also great--but I think the savory foods (especially the appetizers) were the real star of the show.

Since it was his birthday and it was noted on the reservation, they also brought out a beautiful little plate with \"Happy Birthday!\" in script in strawberry sauce, with the daintiest, cutest little cupcake & a sparkler.  The extra food was unnecessary but it was a really special touch on an evening that was very special for us.  

All in all, a great evening, with great food--but it was the service that really made it just stellar. We'll remember this visit for a long time and Lola will be our first choice for special occasions.  Can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"Lola has great ambience.  I took my partner here for her birthday, and it didn't disappoint.  We ordered the fois groe appetizer and it was just okay.  We also ordered the tomato salad and it was BANGIN'.  

For the entree, my partner had the sweet corn gnocchi and it was delicious!!!!  I had the steak, and it was good, but not cooked to the temperature I asked for.  I asked for medium well and probably got medium rare.  I only ate half of it.

Dessert was great.  We had the peanut butter crunch with banana ice cream and the Lola Smores.  Both were yummy!

Price is what to expect from a high end restaurant.  We moved to Cleveland from NYC, so found the prices to be reasonable for the type of restaurant it is.

Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"Michael Symon is my hero, my bald little hero...

We had a Cleveland weekend and you cant go downtown and splurge without going here. A little casino, a few drinks, and Michael. Ya buddy

We started with drinks and I went with the Manhattan, very tasty and not too sweet. You can go overboard with the vermouth. For the app we ordered the lobster roll with crème fraiche. It was good but I really think the dish would have been better if it were served hot on a thicker piece of brioche.

I went with the beef hanger steak and it was awesome! It was tender and perfectly cooked. I went with Medium and it was great. Savory and sweet with the pickle sauce, and just plain tasty! I would highly recommend.

 For dessert I had the strawberry panna cotta, and it was decadent. Sweet and tart with the fresh berries and tuile. It was perfect, except I just couldn't seem to get enough!

I can honestly say I couldn't have asked for a better experience. Great food, good drinks, an excellent waiter, and a dessert that made me cry a little. Just a little..."}
{"text":"We celebrated our 20th Anniversary with a mini trip to Cleveland which included dinner at Lola Bistro. The wait staff was exceptional as were the food and atmosphere. We started with the beef cheek pierogis and they were to die for!  My husband ordered the lamb shank and it really was a whole lamb shank!  My scallops were cooked perfectly and the sticky toffee pudding was a delicious delight. The signature Lola Cocktail was a great choice and there was an extensive beer, wine, and cocktail menu. Our serve was attentive but not intrusive and presented herself in a friendly and professional way. The manager was on the floor greeting guests and filling water glasses and the bus person was quick to tidy up tables between courses. All in All a definite 5/5 Stars and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Five for food, outstanding really. Three for service, efficient but flat. The bone marrow starter, served with 8 accompaniments, including bacon & date jam, and smoked blue cheese sauce, delivered on presentation, flavors, and textures; definitely memorable - I think all four of us said \"Wow!\" when it arrived at our table. The ricotta black truffle gnocchi was perfectly decadent, rich and creamy, but a petite portion so you don't hate yourself for indulging. For entrees we had the scallops (perfect sear), pork chop (tender and smoky, creamy polenta), lamb shank ( fall off the bone goodness), and the ribeye (juicy and perfectly seasoned). Roasted cauliflower is tasty with a nice caramelization. Herb fries, flavorful, tender and crispy. Cookies and milk dessert is way out-of-the-box fun to look at and eat - all the flavors of childhood preserved, but not too sophisticated to enjoy. The 6 AM dessert represented all the best flavors and aromas of breakfast. A culinary adventure. Maybe our server was having a bad day; he was kind of a sourpuss."}
{"text":"Great lunch and dinners.  A little pricey, but its been the best meal since I've moved to Cleveland from Seattle.  East 4th is a nice street too.  If you're looking for a nice business lunch or classy dinner, this is your place.

Great patio too when the weather is on your side!"}
{"text":"Excellent! I never thought I would like the beef cheek pierogi, let me tell you, it was fantastic!! Chef's table is cool because you can watch the open kitchen."}
{"text":"I thought Lola would be the best restaurant in Cleveland or close to it but was disappointed. This Lola isn't even the best Lola I've eaten at (shout out to Tom Douglas and Seattle).

I started with the pierogis (2 for $14) filled with shredded beef and covered with a savory sauce that really didn't do it for me. Tasted like steak drippings with herbs used in beef dishes. The pierogis were good but not worth going back for.

The hangar steak I ordered with fries had the same sauce or similar enough to the pierogi sauce that it gave me the same experience. I spit out two pieces due to fat content. Not great.

Fries were good but came with no sauce, they offered ketchup which I took but they should have aioli.

Not worth going back for."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is on point.  Drinks l, food, bar doesn't ma tier you are going to enjoy your experience."}
{"text":"Was super excited to try Lola being that I'm a huge Michael symon but I defitnely was a little disappointed. The food did taste great but for the amount of food we got not sure if it was worth the price. The courses seemed to just lack a side. My boyfriend got scallops which he loved but then there was just a little purée on the side and I think one piece of a vegetable.  My steak was good but again couple vegetables and that's it. We went and got snacks for the hotel room after we left dinner. The wine and drink selection was very impressive and I liked the open kitchen concept that they had. Overall the food tasted good but I won't be dying to go back the next time I'm in Cleveland"}
{"text":"Love the location.  Lot of hip restaurants nearby, but this one stands out because of its unique menu and high quality food. The pork belly appetizers were so good."}
{"text":"First time in Cleveland and decided to have a nice Friday dinner. Being fans of the Iron Chef show, we decided to eat here, plus it's just a block from the hotel. With the dark wood, dim lighting, candle lit table, large painting on the wall, white table cloth, and an open kitchen, the place gives you that classic old school upscale intimate with a modern flair dining ambiance. Food is a bit disappointing, it wasnt bad, its just we had such high expectations. For a restaurant owned by an Iron Chef, one would think everything or at least most would be on point and super special. So for appetizers had beef cheek pierogi, pork belly and crispy pig ear, and lola fries. The fries was quite disappointing, a bit heavy on the salt and did not even come with any dip to cut the saltiness. The meat on the pierogi was very tender, it has flavor but nothing special to it, maybe except for the little horseradish that gave it some kick. The porkbelly is just fried pork belly, though I really enjoyed the pig ears that were really crispy and tasty. The wife had the scallop dish, also on the salty side, it was good but I thought the dish could use some more acidity. My very tender lamb shank also wasn't special and even  the veggies that came with I thought were boring. Though for dessert, the french toast with maple bacon ice cream did not disappoint. One of the better french toast I've had, and the maple bacon ice cream was really good, plus the bits of apple that came with it provided extra flavor and texture.  The vanilla apple cider cocktail was also very good. Overall the food was good, though we were expecting more Wow! factor. Price is not that bad either and food portion was plenty. Service was nice and our server was friendly, in fact most people we get to chat with in Cleveland all seem friendly."}
{"text":"Beef cheek pierogis are my favorite.  You get what you pay for here.  Fresh, seasonal ingredients inspired by a local culinary hero.  I've had the chance to meet Mike a few times at local events and at his restaurant.  A true class act."}
{"text":"Came here to try this celebrity restaurant but the quality of the food isn't as expected at all.  Service is really good tho."}
{"text":"Everything was top notch from the food to the service. Definately worth the money. Appetizers and entrees were phenomenal."}
{"text":"Probably the best restaurant I've been to. Service was stellar. Had the Hanger Steak - best steak I've had and I've been to some great steak houses."}
{"text":"I would have given 5 stars, but the power went out and we were not served dinner.  The bone marrow was the pinnacle of any meal, wow, all I can say is wow.

We ordered a bottle if wine not to our liking, the manager Jude came over, recommended a great wine for less money and served two cocktails on the house (both were GREAT) while we waited,

Overall, interesting, fun, and we missed a fabulous meal."}
{"text":"Exceptional service, food, and wine. Just all around fantastic! I really had a wonderful time and could not have been happier when I left."}
{"text":"I tried the recently opened Lola in downtown Cleveland this past week.  Comparing this place to other hip spots in LA, I'd have to say it's a shame we don't have a place like Lola here.  

I ate at the bar and had two appetizers - smoked walleye fritter (or was it called a \"cake\"?) with a sweet corn relish and braised short rib pierogies - and an entree (pan seared north atlantic halibut with roasted tomatoes and tapenade).  The fritter/cake was nice and flavorful, but with very little smoke flavor.  The sweet corn relish was that - sweet. It didn't go too well with the Italian sparkling wine I had (I forgot the name - I know, gotta take notes next time) because the sweetness of the corn was really overpowering.  However, the braised short rib pierogies were great.  They were sauced (too little sauce) with a horseradish cream which cut through the slightly oily dough and rich filling.  This matched nicely with the Stelzner Claret that I had.  The entree was very well cooked, although the tapenade was too salty and didn't go well with the Sancerre I was drinking.

But, to me, the best part of Lola were the service and prices.  The hostess went out of her way to secure me a place at the bar in the corner where I could eat relatively undisturbed among the \"trying hard to look good crowd\" and the smokers.  Yes - in Cleveland, you can still smoke indoors.  And the prices were tremendously reasonable.  Two appetizers, entree and three glasses of wine was $75 dollars.  Most entrees were under $30 and the wine list was varied, eclectic with most wines at extremely reasonable mark-ups.  The 2002 Araujo Eisele Vineyard Cab was $225.  This wine would go for over $300 in California and it's made here!!!  Unreal!  

A few kinks need to be worked out and it's loud - really loud - but a really enjoyable place to go with a great bar scene.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Beef cheek pierogi appetizer was light dumplings with shredded beef cheek filling and a tasty sauce.  Raw cruciferous salad was outstanding and unusual curry-spiced cauliflower salad with a perfect mix of sweet, creamy, and crunchy ingredients. We had duck, pork, and scallops and they were all great.  The cheesy polenta and sweet potato sides were high quality and flavorful sides. The 6am Special dessert was our favorite. About $70 per person, which makes sense for fine dining with great service."}
{"text":"To update my last review. I've been to Lola many times. And this was the first time everything wasn't spot on. Michael Symon is definitely my favorite Chef. The Entrees were delicious we had the pork and the halibut. And you can never go wrong with Lola fries. It was the rest of the meal that caught me off guard. The beef cheek perogies were a little on the small side but had a great flavor. Maybe a touch to much salt but still delicious. I would definitely come back and still recommend to all my friends and patrons. Lolitas is still my favorite of his cleveland spots. Can't wait to try B Spot!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm kind of in love with with Michael Symon.  

it was because of this that my best friend and I decided to use our spring break week off (perk of working for the schools) to take a little BFF roadtrip down to Cleveland, for the sole purpose of eating at Lola. (we checked out some other stuff to...but it was all secondary). 

WOW....best meal of my life, I'd have to say.  Or at least, the SLIMMEST of second places to a birthday dinner I had at the Rattlesnake Club in Detroit. 

The salad had bleu cheese, candied pecans, perfectly dressed with the lightest, most delicious vanilla viniagerette (if that stuff was offered to take home by the bottle, I would have handed over a blank check and told them to write in any amount they wanted).  Heaven.  I could have eaten only that and still walked out raving. 

Entree was a ribeye.  Now, I am not at all a big red meat eater.  But on the occassions I do eat it, I like it done right.  Good choice on my part, because if red meat always tasted as delicious as this steak, I would eat nothing but.  Cooked to a perfect medium, and topped with a smudge of bleu cheese....every bite just melted in my mouth.  To this day, I swear I can still practically taste it, thinking back...

Dessert was a green apple & sweet creme trio-style dish....honestly I think I was so overwhelmed by my salad and steak that the dessert was a little shadowed.  It was amazing, I ate every bite...yet when I think back, the details escape me of the exact preparations involved on the plate.

The space is beautiful inside.  Dark enough to be sexy, with sleek and modern decor.  The servers were knowledgable and professional, but not upright (uniform of dark jean bottoms with their apron and button down helped this).  

I am planning on going back to Cleveland for a concert in a few weeks, and will definitely be going back to Lola."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  We were staying nearby and only stayed at Lola for appetizers, which we later regretted.  The food was amazing.  We had the seared scallops on a short rib risotto.  We visited four cities on this trip and that dish was hands-down the best thing we ate the entire time.  Also had the beef cheek pierogie-- also very good.  That first dish though?  That's a classic."}
{"text":"Worst dinner I have ever had in Cleveland. My halibut was cold and my daughters appetizer was slivers of tuna.  
We were so disappointed. We were celebrating an award and this ended our evening in a terrible way. We ended stopping somewhere else on the way home because we were so hungry. 
I'm from Chicago so please don't say you are anything like what we have in Chicago. Your decor is similar to a few restaurants but that is as close as you get. 
Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Like millions of others, the wife and I seem to get sucked into the celebrity-chef culture that seems to dominate high-end American dining these days.  So when we came to Cleveland, we dutifully went off to Michael Symon's Lola.  

We lived in New Orleans for more than a decade, during the heyday of Emeril's long run as America's Big-Time Celebrity Chef.  Although the food at Lola is inspired by cuisines and ingredients different from those of Emeril's flagship in New Orleans, the entire production at Lola reminds me quite a bit of Emeril's:  It's a big bustling restaurant with very good food, mostly excellent service, big portions for an upscale place, and a lot of crowd-pleasing menu items.  And it's probably somewhat overpriced because of the mostly-absent chef/owner's notoriety.   

There's something a bit clunky about Lola.  I'm not a fan of the decor and atmosphere at all:  seriously dark, with almost no colors other than black and grey, the restaurant brings to mind a somewhat cheesy upscale cocktail lounge.  The soundtrack of heard-them-a-million-times classic-rock songs was kind of annoying, too.  The menu, too, doesn't exactly seem to jibe as far as pairing apps and entrees go; ingredients and influences seem like they're all over the map.

What we had was good, though.  The beef cheek pierogis were absolutely terrific as an appetizer:  melt-in-your-mouth texture and huge, deep beefy flavor.  The smoked Berkshire pork chop, served with a cheesy polenta, is upscale comfort food and a massive sliced slab of meat; it was very satisfying and maybe even too much a good thing.  The wife got the wild salmon, which was served with fava beans, chanterelles, baby tomatoes, and a delicious green-pea-and-mint puree.  She reported that most of it was cooked perfectly, although the one bite she left over for me seemed a little overdone.  A green salad was pretty unmemorable, and had too many giant leaves in it.

Our server was talkative and quite efficient, but I got the impression by the end of the meal that his knowledge of the food and wine list (stored on an iPad) wasn't as thorough as he'd have liked you to believe.

Overall, an enjoyable evening, but after we were done, we wondered whether we should have instead checked out some undersung Cleveland restaurant, e.g., Crop, instead of making a beeline for the Big Boy's place."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant.  Service at the bar was good.  Had dinner there.  Ordered the beef cheek pierogies, and scallops.  Nice cocktail selection."}
{"text":"Wonderful!

App: charcuterie plate + beef cheek pierogies (tender)
Entree: Berkshire pork chops (delicious, flavourful)
Dessert: 6am special (unique, but bacon bits tasted like Chinese pork jerky to me)

Friends had: cavatelli & Walleye, doughnut special & passionfruit"}
{"text":"The food and service are both excellent! I highly enjoy and recommend this restaurant.  I love the beef pierogies as an appetizer!! Very nice restaurant for a night out on East 4th. Perfect for special occasions."}
{"text":"So Yelp I think we need to implement a 4 1/2 stars~but this place was lovely.
The vibe is cool, every staff person had good vibes too.  No pretentious-ness whatsoever.  You can order your groups drinks off an Ipad after looking through their menu and enjoy a reasonably priced drink at their cool bar.  Ahhhh.
    So for dinner, we really enjoyed the beef cheek pierogies.  Very delish...you get 2.
I wasn't in love with the heirloom salad, too much cabbage but my friend ordered the apple & goat cheese salad, that was the best goat cheese ever.  So creamy.
          The menu is relatively short, but we're not at TGI Fridays folks, nothing is frozen.  
I enjoyed my Beef hanger steak, and the roasted potatoes go Perfect with it.  The fries are just fries so get the potatoes!  I wish we had room for dessert but it wasn't possible lol.  

Oh footnote here, this is the first place I ever had to send my steak back because it was undercooked, but it was juicy and delish once they made it medium.  I normally don't send food back but I don't like to see that much red!  The other peoples steaks at the table were fine though, fyi."}
{"text":"Great pork! Really good staff. I'll be back the next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Previous Yelp reviews were very helpful in choosing this restaurant. I was here on business, alone, and decided to spend the company's dime at a nice restaurant. I wasn't very hungry, so I opted for a cocktail and small salad.

I stopped by around 7pm on a Tuesday night and they had a 30 minute wait for inside and outside tables. The bar was full, but half of the patrons were just waiting for a table. A seat opened up within 5 minutes of me arriving at the restaurant.

I had the Hot & Dirty martini, which was perfect. For grub, I chose the Beet Salad. It was great. It had pistachios, prosciutto and some sort of mild cheese that very well could have been mozzarella. This is the type of restaurant where the menu doesn't list every single ingredient. So, I was pleasantly surprised with the cheesy addition. The dish itself is very much a starter. So, for chicks that aren't looking to overindulge at a great restaurant, it's the way to go.

Ambiance is great. Bar looks cool. People are friendly. End of story."}
{"text":"It's not often that I get to visit a restaurant that hasn't been reviewed by one of my yelp friends, but I did take the time to read some of those reviews.

First of all, I have no idea who Micheal Symon is, nor do I care to know.

This place is very nicely decorated with a very contemporary touch. That gave me a great first impression already. The bar was a bit small, but it seemed to work just fine for the amount of visitors during dinner time. I had made a reservation for 2 and I only had to wait about 15 extra minutes to be seated. I was happy enough to get a last minute reservation. 

I changed into jeans in the nearby residence inn I was staying before coming to the restaurant. I kept my black shirt on. Well, that was a mistake. The outfit turned out to be the UNIFORM for the waiters. Don't repeat my mistake!

So, I'm going to post a few pictures here. I'm going to start with the drink menu. The idea of using an ipad a drink menu is something I always wonder about since the introduction of tablet PC (way before ipads). My thoughts after seeing it in action for the first time? Cool, but FILTHY! You are right, it's not any more filthy then the regular menu, but ipad shows fingerprints much better. It just looks and feels more filthy than a traditional menu even if it's not. I think I will order without a menu next time.

The drink selection was disappointing. There is nothing on tap. I know it doesn't go with most of the food served here, but I was in the mood for beer while waiting (not with the food).

I ordered 3 things. Oh and yes, I will have a picture for each one.

First up was the ceviche. I suppose it could be different depending on the type of ceviche they serve that day. What I got was spearfish ceviche. The raw spearfish had texture that's unlike most sashimi you find in the sushi bars. It was the closest to sea bass. With a rather unconventional list of ingredients including radish and orange, it was an amazing 5 bites to start off my dinner (check out the picture, you will know what I mean). 

Then comes one of the best steak I ever had. It's going to be difficult to describe how it tastes, so I will start with how it looks. 
It looks like the steak was seared so that the edges are thinly cooked and flavored while 95% of the area in the middle are cooked to perfect medium rare.
I really have no idea how that's done, but that's what make this steak perfect.
I get 95% of the perfectly juicy medium rare steak instead of just the 50% in the center. With the nicely seared edges to provide the extra flavor, every bite was heaven. I think I'm going to fly over to cleveland for this steak instead of driving to brooklyn for peter luger.

No meal is complete without a dessert that just knock your socks off. They managed to combine 2 of my favorite things into this creation. raspberry macaroon ice cream sandwich. If you think this creation look good, you don't know the half of it. You can start drooling or just book a ticket to cleveland. The 2 sides are typical macaroon done to perfection. If you know macaroon, you'd know that it isn't easy to make it big and not collapse. Well, those are extra large raspberry macaroons with feet! The vanilla ice cream...no gelato in the center are perfectly silky that completed a perfect bite from the cruchy crust to chewy and fruity cheeks to an absolutely delightful frozen treat in the middle. 

Lucky for me, I only need to book one flight to cleveland to have both the hanger steak and the raspberry macaroon ice cream sandwich. Because that's exactly what I'm doing.

So, who's Michael Symon? I have no idea. I still don't care."}
{"text":"Not so good. Over rated. We had heard this place was the cat's meow. I guess the cats were yowling at the coarse flavors that emited from our menu choices. The stank was overwhelming. The service wadslow and the tab was over the top. Sorry. Won't be dining here again."}
{"text":"My husband & I had dinner at Lola Friday night. We travel quite a bit and have eaten at many fabulous restaurants around the country & looked forward to our first visit to Lola as we hear raves about it but live far enough from Cleveland that we rarely go there unless planning to spend the night. I have to say we were both disappointed and will not be likely to try Lola again. 

We split the raved about beef cheek pierogies and the beet & pear salad; he had the halibut and I ordered the scallops. Presentation of all was excellent. The pierogies were good but not memorable. 

The salad was pretty, but minuscule..... way beyond minimal. What there was of it was tasty, but again not memorable. Entire serving made about 4 forkfuls. Bread was crusty and delicious. The wine was excellent. He says the halibut was ok but very dry. I couldn't finish my scallops because they were incredibly salty - that was the only taste, completely overwhelming the dish. 
Service was decent although one waiter took our wine order, a young woman came by & introduced herself as our waiter & then never returned and a third young man ultimately delivered the wine and took our order and completed our service although we never did get his name....
The decor is lovely however the noise level was quite loud - not what I would expect in a place of this type, more like a very loud bar. We could not hear the first waiter's description of the specials beyond a couple of words & felt like we were shouting to hear each other although we were seated at an intimate 2 top away from nearby tables. I have no idea if there was any background music because neither of us could detect any. All in all a disappointing experience, certainly not what we expected from the vaunted Michael Symon's flagship restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a really great place! Beautiful interior, and the food was sublime. I went with my mom, and we started with the beef cheek peirogi, which was simply incredible. The she had the grilled cheese and I had the trout. The grilled cheese was the best either of us ever tasted, and the trout was far and away the best I have ever had. 

The service was excellent, and the atmosphere is great. On top of all that, it's pretty cheap! The grilled cheese was only $9! Great beer selection too. 

If you haven't been here, stop reading and go!!!"}
{"text":"OK yelpers.  Settle in with a snack and a drink.  This may be my longest review ever.

I made a reservation for my wife's birthday.  We were greeted and seated promptly at what is probably the best table in the place.  The lighting is subtle and the colors soft.  Great ambiance.  Excellent feel.

We were greeted promptly by our server, Nicole.  She gave us the wine menu which is on an iPad.  Very cool.  We chose a bottle and ordered the beef cheek pierogi, the pork belly, the white bean soup and a Greek salad to split.

Let me start by saying our server, Nicole, was top notch.  I spent a year in grad school waiting tables and it's not a cake walk.  This young lady had it together and was very professional.  The front of the house management is on top of it at Lola.  The staff is swift, efficient, and friendly.

Now the food.

The pork belly was, in a word, sublime.  I've had pork belly in a dozen restaurants and the closest competition Mike Symon has here is at Michael's Genuine in Miami, Florida.

The plate was presented with a nice heap of Julienned carrots and other veggies with a sprinkling of cilantro.  The sauce is out of this world.  Piquant, tangy, fragrant and popping with flavors.  Every bite was a different taste experience.  My wife went crazy for it and I wasn't far behind.

The beef cheek pierogis were outrageous.  The beef itself was perfectly seasoned and oh so moist.  The two large pierogis were garnished with a rich dark sauce and horseradish creme.  Delicious.  Slivered green onions topped the dish.  I couldn't leave any sauce on the plate so I mopped up what was left with the crispy bread.  No complaints here.

Water was refilled promptly and the soup arrived.  It was a lovely pumpkin color and Nicole was nice enough to split it for us as we were sharing.  Excellent service.

The soup was rich and flavorful but not overpowering.  

The salad was fresh, crisp, and perfectly dressed.  We finished it and shortly thereafter our entrees arrived.

The hanger steak my wife ordered was tender and perfectly cooked.  The Lola fries are outrageously tasty and rich.

My Berkshire smoked pork chop was the highlight of my meal.  It's hard to describe this dish except to say there's a little bit of heaven in every bite.

The smokiness of the pork combined with the cheesy polenta and chile sauce was rich beyond compare without having too many things going on on a single plate.  The balance of flavors was unmatched and I was truly saddened when it was all gone.  What a dish!

We didn't have room for dessert but Nicole brought out a plate of fresh cookies and a candle for my wife's birthday.  A very nice touch.

I've been living in Cleveland for about 12 years now and this is, by far, my most memorable meal here.  Michael Symon has put together a winning menu in a venue that would hold its own in any city on the planet.  

If you have a chance to go to Lola by all means do.  You won't regret it.

Chris"}
{"text":"Had a later dinner here at 9:45 on Saturday night with 5 of my girlfriends. The food was all amazing and the service was awesome as well. The price range and diversity of the wine menu was great...something for everyone. For being so late we did not feel rushed or pushed out. Very enjoyable!!"}
{"text":"Beef cheek piriogi was super good and I enjoyed the hanger steak.  Really nice atmosphere with average service."}
{"text":"Delightfully surprising. Grab a seat on the patio, order the cabernet and burrata, and leave room for the peppermint pattie dessert. Btw, very gluten free friendly. This place was so enchanting."}
{"text":"This is a belated review, perhaps love note to Lola.  We drive 6 hours to see you every time. And each time we do, dear Lola, you never disappoint.  I'll admit it: we love the hog as much as you and really, I don't know what more you could do to make it awesome. Okay, well, maybe the 5am breakfast special (is that what it is called) for dessert is pretty damn good too. (Bacon ice cream people!!).   Here's the deal. Lola is one of Michael Symon's restaurants, and sure he's an Iron Chef and just shows up on occasion (but having been we know he is actually there!) -- but that's not the point. What matters is that Lola is mighty fine at providing a hip-but-casual ambience; an affordable-for-what-you-get-fancy-meal; and good,solid, midwestern hospitality. The staff seems pretty happy that you came.   Each of our visits we've tried some variation on the apps and entrees--pierogies, pork chop (also called the pork-flavored pork chop in our house); venison,elk, whatever. All solid, happy, food is what food eat kind of things.  To paraphrase on what M. Symon once said (it may have been about bacon)....Lola makes people happy."}
{"text":"Came here for restaurant week on a Friday night. We were glad we booked the 7:15PM reservation early because we checked back later in the week and the place was booked up until 9PM. The restaurant décor is just what you would imagine from Lola- classy, clean, intimate. Big bar in the front area and a partially open kitchen in the back with what looked like a chef's table area. 
My boyfriend ordered the carnivore restaurant week special ($40) with wine pairing (4 wines for $15) and I got the Smoked pork chop entrée. All four courses of the restaurant week deal were fabulous. Beautiful presentation and ended up being very filling. The apple tart at the end was the best thing I've had in a while and I never usually get dessert. I liked the hangar steak a little bit more than my smoked pork but both were delicious. The polenta that came with my pork is a life changer. In fact, we bought polenta the next day and tried to recreate it (unsuccessful).
Would definitely go for the wine pairing if you are getting a drink for the price point. All 4 were delicious and unique. They even added 2 homemade thin mints at the end to top off the great meal!"}
{"text":"Food is very high quality, but giving 4 stars for lack of atmosphere. We had two appetizers of shrimp and crudo and I had hangar steak and tiramisu for dessert. Everything was delicious and the server seated us at a great table against the wall. We could take everything in while having dinner. But again, the tired atmosphere did little to compliment the outstanding dishes we had, so it was more of a very nice dinner and not an \"experience.\""}
{"text":"Exceptional service, fantastic flavors and amazing cocktails and wine. We had a great pre-concert date. We only wish we had saved room for dessert! Guess we will have to trek back again soon!"}
{"text":"We ate at Lola for the first time tonight and liked it a lot.  The food was excellent.  For appetizers we liked both the beef cheek pierogis and the braised Berkshire \"bacon\".  The pierogis sound weird but are very smooth and delicious.  The \"bacon\" is cubes of pork belly with a sort of Chinese flavor.  For dinner we had the pork shank and the sturgeon.  The pork shank was pretty good.  The sturgeon was just average but I'm not so big on fish.  

The desserts are where things get really strange.  I had the Sour Cream and Apple Panna Cotta, which included sour cream flavored mounds, some apple sorbet, and some other things arranged on a long plate.  It includes fennel and celery, which put me off when I read it but it tasted fine.  We also had the 6 A.M. Special, which had deep-fried French Toast and maple-bacon ice cream.  It was okay but the bacon in the ice cream is just a bit too strange.

The restaurant is the darkest I've eaten at in a long time.  When you go in you end up in foyer with glass walls, so when it's night you have to look carefully to see where the door is.  They have magnifying flashlights to help you read the menu.  They really should just install some lights.

The service was good.  The waitress was good about explaining things, and even the busboy could go on about the food there.  They take pride in working at Lola.

To get all this isn't cheap.  Most people can't afford to eat here often but it is an excellent choice for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Had the scallops and they are the best scallops I have EVER had!  The combination of grapefruit, lump crabmeat, endive and scallops was incredible.  The scallops were browned on each side to give a crunchy exterior and a tender center.  Environment was classy.  Very active, but with enough space to hold conversations that other tables can not hear."}
{"text":"Passing through Cleveland on a road trip, I decided I had to stop both here and Lolita simply to say I've been.  Lola didn't disappoint, but it's also not quite my vibe.  It's located on this strange little street that's packed with restaurants and bars, but there's nothing else happening around this street - it feels very contrived, like someone decided they needed a restaurant row of sorts.  Inside, the bar is lit-up, yellow, uber-trendy, and very busy on a Wednesday night. 

I found one of two available seats at the bar and ordered a glass of wine and the 6 a.m. surprise - maple bacon ice cream, mini brioche french toasts, and carmelized apple.  Each of the flavors were so distinct and good.  The bartender pushed me to eat some of each - ice cream, french toast & apple - all at once to get the whole experience but I felt that lessened all the flavors, so I went back to eating each separately.  I generally love bacon ice cream and this was no exception, but the brioche french toast was even better than the ice cream.  

It's a cute fun place to check out if you can overlook the hype and remember that you'll probably be overpaying for the name."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience here. Absolutely first rate food and service. The signature beef cheek pierogi is wonderful -- great starter for sharing. We also tried the pork belly, which was rich and delicious. I frequently get a chicken dish the first time I try a nice restaurant, just as a baseline to compare with other places. It did not disappoint. The preparation was quite simple, but cooked perfectly. The kielbasa-style chicken sausage was a nice touch. My companions had the scallops and the flank steak, and a bite of each proved they were just as good.

Service was very good. Our waiter recognized early on that we were quite an informal table, and his demeanor shifted more social. Some people wouldn't like that, but I'm quite sure that he only did it after paying attention to us. The space is beautiful. I love the decor and open kitchen. Furniture was comfortable.

One complaint, not enough to dock a star: I loathe the iPad-based drinks menu. It's tacky and not functional enough. I'm not 100% opposed to using a tablet, but the app has to be *perfect* and this was nowhere near that. The app ran on a first-gen iPad, with its low-res screen and lack of power. It was clunky, imprecise, and required way too much tapping (you have to tap each cocktail one at a time to see its description). Either update the app and hardware, or, even better, don't fix what wasn't broken, and print a drinks menu. The drinks themselves were delicious -- so it's an easy flaw to forgive. This is a 5 star place for sure: go and enjoy one of Cleveland's best!"}
{"text":"Oh wow.  That is what I kept repeating over and over.
My husband & I made a reservation at Lola for our 35th wedding anniversary.  It helped that our daughter in Austin gave us a gift certificate earlier in the summer.  She shares with us an appreciation for really good food.
Our server, Elizabeth, was so helpful when we asked her opinion on appetizer, entrée & dessert selections. We chose a bottle of wine from a wide variety, some at very reasonable prices. The appetizer we selected was the Pancake & Eggs.  Oh wow. 
I am mostly (not strict) vegetarian, but was hesitant to choose the only vegetable entrée on the menu.  Elizabeth assured me that it was one of her favorites, and she was right!  It probably helped that this was a great time of year to take advantage of great tasting fresh vegetables. The heat from the shishito peppers was just right.  The texture from the barley & the sauce & flavor from the cilantro was exquisite. So many layers of flavor.
I was too busy enjoying my entrée to fully appreciate the flavors in the Parisian Gnocchi that my husband selected. I did note that this particular style of gnocchi was lighter than most traditional gnocchi.  He thoroughly enjoyed it.
We were surprised with a plate containing two moist, chocolate cupcakes with a raspberry frosting which they brought us for our anniversary.  We then chose the deconstructed Tiramisu for dessert.  \"Oh wow\" in every bite.
We could detect so many layers of flavor in everything we selected.  That is the difference between Lola & other restaurants we have gone to.  It was truly a special-occasion place for us & a wonderful evening.  Oh wow....."}
{"text":"Fabulous.

Good:
* Cool, laid-back atmosphere
* Server was lovely, her recommendations for everything were spot-on
* Of the appetizers: beef cheek pierogies are first-rate, the crab gnocchi (with fresh corn) was fantastic
* Of the entrees:  Ribeye - huge, 13 oz of rich meat with a foie gras butter.  I could only eat half.  Halibut was great, so was rabbit.  
* Dessert: 6am dessert, and the molten chocolate dessert with raspberry sorbet.  YES YES YES.
* $5 for the fries (w/rosemary and salt).  Excellent deal.

Bad:
* Parking is hellish around here when there's anything going on downtown, especially since the roads have been in some state of perpetual repair in for a while.  I'm guessing that you can use the valet near Pickwick and Frolic at the southern end of E 4th.
* Yes, the portions are small, but man, they are rich.  We practically had to roll ourselves out of the joint."}
{"text":"This is not the place to order a salad or a light meal - if you go, Do Lola Right! 

I told the server to order for me, and she hooked me up. I started with the Beef Cheek Pierogi. Oh my - melt in your mouth. The Pierogi dough was light and sweet, the filling of beef cheek was divine, and the horseradish creme fraiche brought it all home. YUM! 

My entree was the Smoked Berkshire Pork Chops. They are served over cheesy polenta with BBQ Onions. I'm a big pork eater (love me a good pork tenderloin) and this was some of the best pork I've ever tasted. I was in heaven! 

We were very full and had to skip in desert, but I am informed that the desert to try is the 6am Special.  This desert creation is french toast, maple bacon ice cream and carmelized apples.  I'll be back to try that one, soon!

The best part about this restaurant is that they don't rush you - they pace the meal very well. It's the kind of place that isn't just a restaurant, but an eating experience. I will return, over and over!"}
{"text":"Yes there's great food in Cleveland even though the downtown area was very quiet during a recent January business trip.  I headed into Lola and it was just about the only place where there was some energy on a cold snowy night.  I started with the beef cheek perogis and then dug into the wild steelhead trout for an entrée.  Both were terrific and the bartender suggested a nice lager called Great Lakes brewed locally.  The do have an insane wine list but I was in the mood for a beer.  I've been to Symon in Vegas and he and his team know how to treat their patrons well."}
{"text":"Ate here during a business trip. Loved the food and the service. I love to eat, so its always good to find a special place. It's a must if your in Cleveland. 

Visited July 2011"}
{"text":"i've been twice before although not for 2 years, and well, i was expecting top notch and it just didn't happen. surprisingly, not even close... i guess michael symon is a busy man. and so the place has slipped. from cocktail to dessert, there were too many misses to mention. this leads to the question, when does a celeb chef lose control? wild mushrooms were crazy salty and sent back. crispy sweetbreads not crispy, salads served on these annoying long skinny plates are only ok at best - definitely not special... an almost undrinkable aviation - completely unbalanced. i suppose symon's empire has gone corporate in a way... or something. i'm upset. not because our dinner was mediocre but because it's heartbreaking to me... lola has jumped the shark. damn. just damn..."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time the other night and really glad we made reservations because the people who came in right after us were told it was a 2 hour wait. We were seated by the kitchen which is open and really cool to see the chefs cooking.

We had... Beef Cheek Piergoie for appetizer and it was very good. Bread and butter was also brought to our table and I was a little disappointed that it was so plain; one piece just to taste and the rest went to waste. Main dishes included the Hanger Steak which was very tasty, however the fries that come with it are like matchstick fries and were not anything special. Would not get the fries again. My date had the Sturgeon and it was good. For dessert we ordered the 6am special and it was good, however prepare yourself for a diabetic coma because it was super sweet, could not taste the bacon flavored ice cream, only maple syrup. We were also brought a special dessert that they just came up with; dark chocolate with burnt orange ice cream something. Tasty. 

The service was excellent and our food arrived promptly. Pretty pricey, but I would definitely come here again for a special night out."}
{"text":"So in Cleveland and still drooling over my last Iron Chef Dinner at Morimoto's and saw that Iron Chef Michael Symon had a restaurant running. As soon as I knew that another Iron Chef's restaurant was near me, I knew I had to try it out. I jump on open table and was surprised that all reservation times were open???  But brushing off the concern aside, we head on over to the area. The restaurant itself is in a bustling alleyway where there are a few restaurants lined up. We step into Lola and it was dimly lit which makes it a nice spot for a romantic dinner date or a very intimate group dinner.

We sit down in a nice spot of the restaurant providing a solid view of the overall activities within the restaurant. The waitress was very friendly and very attentive to our table and she offered a few suggestions on items that we should order which was helpful. We were able to peruse the vino list on an IPAD and select a solid Malbec. We ordered the beef pierogies, the pork shank, the hangar steak, and of course the French toast dessert. The pierogies were really solid as each plate comes with one and it is great. Definitely could eat a ton of these. The pork shank and the hangar steak were very solid overall. The meat was flavorful and cooked well but the pork shank had a huge portion to it. I know an odd concern. And the hangar steak while good did not blow me away unfortunately.  Definitely full after this but we had to order the dessert. Man this dessert was so bomb. French toast with maple bacon ice cream?? Heaven. Seriously on a plate. 

Overall it was a solid experience. Obviously the bar is set high as this is an Iron Chef establishment, so my critique will be a bit stronger as I did feel the entrees did leaving me wanting more and that there was nothing really special done with them. The appetizer and dessert were fantastic though and this coupled with the great service and the décor of the restaurant makes it a solid 4 star review for me. Will want to check out a few more of Symon's other restaurants too!"}
{"text":"After reading all the rave reviews and hearing constant suggestions, the boyfriend and I decided to venture here on a Saturday night for dinner. Being avid foodies, let me just say we had VERY high expectations for Lola. Not only were those expectations completely met, we were blown away by how amazing the food was. If we had to describe our experience in one word, it would be heavenly. 
We started with the beef cheek pierogi. The flavors were so delicious. For entrees we had the scallops and the beef hanger steak. The scallops were cooked to absolutely perfection. And the beef hanger steak was quite possibly some of the best steak I've ever tasted. Flavored beautifully, tender and oh so juicy. We ended with the sticky toffee cake. Again, delicious and a treat to our tastebuds. 
The ambiance and service was equally superb. Very romantic lighting and decor. The cocktail menu was presented on an iPad, very cool concept and I can guarantee that anyone would be able to find a good drink for themselves. Our server was polite and more than happy to help us with our picks. 
Overall, Lola was exactly an amazing dining experience. Well worth the hefty bill and we will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere with great service. The bone marrow appetizer is delicious and my favorite the scallops"}
{"text":"We went to Lola a couple weeks back and have not stopped talking about it.  We absolutely loved it and will definitely be back!

Started with the Charcuterie platter with a glass of wine at the bar while waiting for our table (we were early and were sat right on time).  After sitting down we had one of the most amazing appetizers of all time- the Crispy Bone Marrow!  What a combination of flavor and texture.  So rich!  For entrees we had the Lamb Shank and the Cavatelli.

Great job Michael!"}
{"text":"After much anticipation, I finally went to Lola for my first Michael Symon restaurant experience. I went for lunch on a Monday and found the restaurant to be a very inviting place. From the moment you enter the glass doorway with unique plants and lighting, you realize this is a place business is conducted in during the lunch hour. Many suits and serious faces here during the lunch hour!

I was very pleased with the lunch prices and selection- everything looked delightful. I ended up choosing the soup & sandwich combo- spicy tomato bisque and the Rosemary ham & cheese. I have to say I really enjoyed the soup with what I believe was blue cheese crumbles! The presentation was very nice, as expected. The sandwich had a nice amount of ham but I thought that the cheese would add more excitement to the flavor then it actually did. 

I enjoyed one of the chocolate gnache desserts. Overall, a nice dining experience. I think if I had gone with one of the more involved lunch dishes I would have given this 5 stars, but I'll confidently go with 4. I'll come back again for dinner, surely!"}
{"text":"What an amazing meal.  Everything was spot on, flavorful, and well balanced.  We had the tuna tartar and beets with burrata to start.  The tuna tartar is different from most and had s great punch from peppers and giant capper berries.  The burrata was amazingly smooth and was perfect with the beets.  We had the duck and scallops for mains.  The duck breast was perfectly cooked and was perfectly accompanied with the chard, squash, and yes grapefruit.  What amazing flavors.  The scallops were huge and perfectly cooked. The flavor profile with the cauliflower was surprisingly fresh and offered great textural contrast.  Desert was figgy pudding.  Again the combo of the components was wonderful: pear, almond, cake, ice cream, and caramel.  Add great cocktails and extensive and affordable wine list and it's a winner."}
{"text":"Originally from NYC and have eaten at MANY Iron Chef and other celeb chef restaurants, I have to say this would not be on my list of favorites.  

My experience was for their New Year's Eve dinner so the full menu was not available.  It was a pre fixe menu, which had many more choices than I expected...so yay for that.  

I ordered the bone marrow, which by itself, was fantastic.  I say \"by itself\" because there were all these side additions in ramekins that resembled a \"make your own\" type of dish.  Eh.

For my entree I got the trout.  It was fine.  I don't really remember anything about it other than I had a fish dish.  Wah wah.


SERVICE was fantastic.  Really really wonderful.  I feel like Chef Symon would be proud to know that he has great people working in his restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. As someone else mentioned, the hostess stand was not particularly engaging, but they got the job done. Besides that everything about my experience was A+. I was quickly seated without a reservation. It was 630 on a tuesday so not that surprising really. Anywho... As soon as i was seated, the waiter brought the drink list, which is on an iPad. That seems to be a common trend now, but still a nice convenience. I selected the Kentucky Gunslinger. If you like bourbon, order this. Lovely apricot notes that push the bourbon to the background a bit, but the flavor still resonates through the drink. For my entree, I had the scallops which were cooked perfectly. Nicely seared and tender in the middle. I had the 6AM Special for dessert which was also great. Salty, sweet, and tart all in one. The cinnamon tuile was a nice touch. They have some tasty coffees to sip with your dessert so make sure to get one of those too. 

60 bucks for a party of 1. Duh, this place is expensive. Dont go here every night. Or you can... I'm a reviewer, not a cop."}
{"text":"A bit over hyped for dinner.  I guess lunch might be better.  Expensive for quality and taste."}
{"text":"Lola is one of the best restaurants I have been to and an excellent date place if you want to take someone special for a fine dining experience. The servers know all of the items on the menu and can give you a quick rundown on what to order. I went with the hanger steak which is easily one of their most popular items on the menu and has been on the menu since the restaurant opened. Also, they have a good wine selection. All in all it was a really good experience dining at Lola."}
{"text":"I've been at Lola almost 3 years ago and at that time I didn't even know it was Michael Simon's restaurant.
I remember I had a good quality meal in a nice environment.. But definitely nothing to die for. Specifically I had some scallops as my main  dish and they were definitely well prepared.
Price was right too.. But nothing was outstanding so I think 4 stars are definitely more appropriate than 5 for Lola.
I hope I'll go back sooner or later.."}
{"text":"My mother and I shared a passion for food and we loved our TV Chefs... most of all Ramsay & Symon (Iron Chef with a million dollar smile). Being that my mom lived in OH, she was always excited over the idea of me visiting and us going to Cleveland to try Lola by Chef Michael Symon. We spoke of it many times over the years. On April 20th, 2018 I lost my mother to cancer. She and I never had the pleasure of dining together at Lola, but I made it a point to go after her service in Akron. It was a rather bitter sweet moment for me... a smile on my face and tears in my eyes. Lola is a beautiful restaurant and the service is fantastic (as one could expect from Chef Symon). Our server was extremely friendly and the restaurant as a whole is warm and welcoming. The drink and food menu had many options that looked interesting, but I love a good cut of meat. We ate the Beef Cheek Pierogi as an appetizer then we each had the Beef Hanger Steak with a pickle sauce, chiles, and it comes with lola fries (rosemary fries). I elected to get the Potato Lyonnaise all of which were delicious! The dish itself as served is almost like a play on a burger and fries. The ambiance was great and the food was prepared in a timely manner... grade A service all around! After finishing our meal, I was too stuffed to try desert so we wrapped up the night. Strolling back to the car through the modern industrial style block I couldn't help but smile (shake too cause it was like 30 degrees... I'm from Miami FL!) And tear up a bit, my Mom would have loved it there. I definitely recommend Lola !!!  I only have a 5 star option, so I figured I can add more down here"}
{"text":"I came with my boyfriend on Sunday night around 7pm, no reservation. Accommodated right away with a romantic round table with a view of the entire ambiance. Our water glasses were filled instantly. Brian, our dedicated server, soon came with wine and cocktail lists. They have a cellar with over 500 wines. Very tough to make a decision, even though it came on an iPad with full details of each. He anticipated our need for help and a polite, we'll dressed man, the sommelier, Manuel, came over to the rescue. He asked what we like and our price point, then brought two options. We got the 2011 Don Maximiano. Very earthy, lengthy and fruit forward. We first enjoyed the bone marrow. 2nd course, split the hanger steak, which Brian noted is the signature dish. Ordered mushrooms and Brussel sprouts for sides. New bottle of wine ordered here, Papillon. 3rd course, split the pork chop. ALL AMAZING

Ambiance: romantic, low lit, wide open, loud in a good time way. It is architecturally modern and beautiful. High ceilings. Long bar. I could even see myself cruising in just for a drink.
Food: Chef Michael Symon does an excellent job offering veggitaroan, pescetarian and meat lovers menu with great American flavor.
Wine: extensive and all made possible when navigated with Manuel the sommelier
Dessert: omg omg omg save room. It's a must. Photos don't do it justice
Service: casually personal and friendly yet entirely professional"}
{"text":"When I had to travel here for work I thought...\"Hmmm...is it possible I am going to be able to find a gem in Cleveland?\" Well, I think we did. This place was delicious! Everything we had was great including the brussel sprouts which were amazing. You MUST try these! Also, a little tidbit is that this place is located probably a mile from the house from the movie \"A Christmas Story,\" so you should probably just check that out, too while you are in the area."}
{"text":"Food was good for the most part delicious. The salmon needed to be properly cleaned and seasoned. The pork chop needed more polenta but was tasty.  Silverware leaves much to be desired hard to hold rolls over in your hand while using, come on Chef Symon! Details details details!  A must try!"}
{"text":"We haven't been to Lola or Lolita for a few years but we have always enjoyed Michael Symons restaurants. It is nice to see they are keeping up their standards. Unfortunately they do not allow you to bring your own wine with a corkage fee so we ordered a nice cab blend. We had a delicious charcuterie plate. The foie gras sausage was delish. All of our entrees were executed flawlessly. I only regret forgetting to order some Brussels sprouts."}
{"text":"I went to Lola because a friend of mine recommended this place to me but their duck didn't taste that good and two of our dishes came out cold. Haven't been there since then."}
{"text":"This is a great Cleveland establishment! I would highly recommend this if you are looking for fine dining in Cleveland."}
{"text":"For the price, I am very disappointed for the variety of taste with my food. The Porkchops my significant other ordered was dry as cardboard. I sent it back and received a replaced plate that was less lean, which did make it less dry, but was still dry. This either tells me that the ingredients and selections were poor, or the preperation was poor. The beef cheeks were nothing that I can boast to my friends about. I ordered a lamb chop, which was pretty good, but not good enough that it should cost $35+. The sauces used to accompany the food had no variations; The Foie Gras appetizer: strawberry jam with nuts and paprika, Lamb chop Entree: Lambchop with red jam sauce, Pork chops with jam sauce... Everything was jam sauced; No taste diversity. 

The service was great, and the wine and beer selection were very diverse."}
{"text":"Ahhhh where to begin!

I must say Lola maybe my most favorite restaurant in northeast Ohio. 
Every time I've dined here its been an absolute pleasure and I leave very happy!

On this occasion my husband and I celebrated our one yr. anniversary so we decided to splurge a little on a bottle of wine. We shared a bottle of Orin Swift Papillon (avable at Heinens) it's amazing, my new favorite!

We had beef cheek pierogis and bone marrow for appetizers. The pierogis are ridiculous, served with a mushroom brown sauce and a little horseradish crème fraiche YUMMMM. The bone marrow I would not order again. It was very good BUT it was super heavy, oily and greasy. They basically took the marrow out of the bone and then fried it. It was served with bacon jam, pickled red onion, crème fraiche, salt and cilantro, it was very good don't get me wrong it was just TOO MUCH! I prefer standard bone marrow, spread it on bread like butter.

For our mains I had the Lobster Thermidor and my mate had the Smoked Pork Chops! 
You guys... Seriously... It was amazing!!!! The lobster was cooked to perfection and wasn't as heavy (in a sauce) as expected. It was fabulous! My husbands was also very very good, it was so tender and the polenta was so warm and buttery. 

For dessert our server gave us complimentary mini cupcakes and a piece of chocolate.
We had such a beautiful time, our service was great no guilt in this dinner!!!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant and fine service but I received what I consider the cardinal sin at a Michael Symon establishment, improperly cooked meat. A very flavorful (at least on the outside) but bone dry pork chop. It was sad, so many things were great but the main event, NOT. The worst part, we sat at the bar overlooking the kitchen and we saw them cook everything but my chop, where did it come from?"}
{"text":"Going back for the double up review.  I have only been to this place twice but it deserves a review each time.  If you go here you need to shred your Weight Watcher point tracking systems.  This man loves bacon, he loves fat and he loves butter so buckle on down and man up.

Appetizers:

Beef Cheek Pierogi - awesome.  I have ate them both times and loved em.  Think Gyoza meets pot roast.

Main Lobster - the creme fraiche alone sells this place but it is a lighter dish that reminds me a bit of a ceviche

Bone Marrow - alright so this one threw me for a loop a bit.  The bone marrow comes deep friend.  Yep, you heard me right... the Bone Marrow is deep friend.  You can spread it on some toast and make it taste pretty good but it is an intense little bite.

Pork Belly - another awesome dish.  I would highly recommend this one.

Entrees:

Wild Sturgeon - again you cannot go wrong with any of his fish dishes.  I try to avoid red meat in general but I had a bite of the pork shop, pork shank and beef hanger steak to try them.  The man doesn't make a bad dish.

Booze:

Martini and then you throw some sriracha in it... yep.  Had three, went to a Cavs game, saw them loose and didn't care."}
{"text":"I give the place 4*, but due to the severe food poisoning my companion received shed give a 1*. We shared all of the same things - except she had the soup with crème fraîche and I had the lobster thermador. Portion was a bit small on mine for $48, but it was fantastic. That's all that she had for an entree, and it was an hour later before things went downhill fast. Too bad as I really want to love this place, especially with Tignanello by the glass, but will probably go back to Red next time after a pretty serious issue."}
{"text":"Really delicious! Dishes are heavily meat based and very filling. Also, the wait time is really long so I recommend making a reservation."}
{"text":"Three words... BEEF CHEEK PIEROGI!! Must, must, must get this starter. My wife surprised me with a visit to Lola's for my birthday. I wish I wrote this review back in March when we visited. Obviously I remember the pierogi! The ambiance of the establishment was very chill. I say that because I think that is the owner's demeanor. He appears to be a great guy to hang out with but when it comes to his food, he puts his game face on. Yeah, next time I'm in Cleveland, I'm definitely stopping here again."}
{"text":"I feel the need to update and downgrade my rating of this place.  It's not that the food was poorly prepared (it really was well prepared).  It's just that the special \"wow factor\" is gone.  The menu seems uninspired.  I was there for Valentine's day.  No special menu.  No special features.  Service was OK, but not as attentive as it was.  So my five star rating is gone.  I wonder if Michael Symon is just spread too thin.  I remember regularly seeing him at Lola and Lolita on special occasions.  No more.  This place is still better than most , but no longer the best."}
{"text":"Food: 4.5/5.0
Service: 4.0/5.0
Value: 3.5/5.0
Decor: 4.0/5.0
Overall: 4.0/5.0 

Tried a couple of items which I thought were okay.  But with the ribeye, I was thoroughly impressed.  Like, straight up I wish Lola was in NY and not Cleveland impressed.  Like, reminded me of B*n*s in Buckhead impressed.  Like, if it were next door to P**** L*g*r and I didn't have a reservation, I would skip the line and consider this instead.  You get the idea.  And this being Cleveland, of course the prices aren't that crazy.  I'm coming back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Phenomenal dining experience! The service was amazing and the food was sublime! I had the bone marrow appetizer...wowie Zowie! The flavor was deep and amazing and just sublime. Entree was the ribeye. It had fennel on top. Simply divine! Well worth the price! Go now!!"}
{"text":"sorry michael symon... but I think i like lolita more than lola. But in Symon's defense, I was also here on restaurant week so maybe it made the food a bit weaker?

Atmosphere: I'm surprised by how BIG the restaurant is. I walked in the restaurant and it was just a this hugeeeee space. Sadly though, the echos are pretty crazy in this restaurant and definitely not a very 'romantic' atmosphere, but of a group outing atmosphere or a group of friends grabbing good food atmosphere. 

Service: I loved our hostess and waiter. Everyone was professional, but I asked about one of my entree (what type of sauce it was) and the waiter had no idea. He had to go into the kitchen to ask. That was a bit unexpected from a Symon store. 

Food: I ordered a wine pairing 3-course dish. It was.. Curry Cauliflower Soup, Trout, and Pana Cotta.

Curry Cauliflower Soup(4): The soup, i thought, was amazing. the curry wasn't strong enough but the cauliflowers flavors really came through. I loved it. The only thing was that the raisins were too overpowering.

Trout (2): Meh...... This was the sad part. The MAIN entree and it was a disappointment. I don't even really remember what it tastes like. The flavors didn't soak into the fish and the skin wasn't tasty enough, it was a bit overcook.

Pana Cotta (5): WHOA!!! A great end to the night! The pana cotta was sooooo good. It was almond pana cotta and i didn't really taste any almond. But the mint leaf on top of the pana cotta just brought me to life. i LOVED Michael Symon's pana cotta.

I would love to come back here again to give it another shot for sure.... specially since al my Yelp friends are loving it."}
{"text":"From appetizers to desserts everything was on point, I tried the salad with goat cheese and marcona almonds, the scallops and for dessert we asked for a French press and the famous Lola's s'mores, that was delicious. They have good menu, good wines, good beers and everyone was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Damn great place!  I am a fan of Michael Symon from his cooking on TV.  Never ate at one of his restaurants, except at airports around the US which are catered to a different concept.  Lola was very good.  We sat outside on the patio which was great.   They have a good menu.  Not too overwhelming.  Specializing in 10-12 entrees at most.   

Decided to have the Ribeye for two.  It was cooked perfectly as well as all of the sides.  Great offerings for Apps and Sides.  The Drink menu is wonderful as well.  Had a Georgia Mule to start which was fabulous.  

I will definitely go back.  I am in town for business, so I might have to try his BBQ restaurant next door tomorrow."}
{"text":"Strong four stars. Opinions:
- bartender was very nice
- fish and chips were an almost poke-like interpretation of the idea. A combination of raw tuna, olives, and dill cream worked surprisingly well.
- asparagus: good, even if a little too strongly citrus-garnished for my tastes. Combination with Parmesan and pecans came off well.
- hanger steak: truly very good. It definitely ran on the more rare side, which I liked. It was nice and tender, and well-flavored. The meat largely spoke for itself, needing not a lot of spices or marinade. It came with a side of crispy shoestring fries, which were good as well.
- lamb shank: good, but not as good as the steak. While the meat was tasty, it came off a little dry, whereas good lamb is usually quite juicy."}
{"text":"went there a couple nights ago with a group of co-workers (including Stephanie C.)----o.m.f.g. FAN FAN FAN FAN FAN!

chef michael symon's restaurant is derrrrricious!!

got to try a few different things:
-hanger steak entree--perfectly cooked. it says it comes with a \"pickle\" sauce. but dont be scared!! its just enough acid. its quite a large portion too. i was stuffed!!
-sturgeon--nicely cooked with a good sear on each side. the sweet potato/chirizo sauce thingy was yummy.
-6 am dessert--bacon maple ice-cream + french toast. SO GOOD!! the ice cream is quite special and delectable, a little salty with the chunks of bacon paired with the french toast is a great combo!
-chocolate + doughnuts--soooooooooooooooooooo gooooooooooooooooooood. 2 coconut doughnuts + one lime/cardamom doughnut with cinnamon hot chocolate. all time/new fave dessert ever in my life. get it fo sho

we had a large group and the waiter did a good job--making sure our wine & water glasses were filled all the time, giving good recommendations, and split it between 8 credit cards :)

i would love to come back again yummms"}
{"text":"Some TV chef restaurants are all hype and no food...I've been to several... I am pleased to report that is NOT true for this one. Excellent can do attitude by the staff and food so good my choosy hubby is willing to try blanched veggies and polenta!!! That is a bigger compliment than most readers will understand. He cures his own meats so even the BLT is amazing.  If I am ever within 100 miles of Cleveland again, I will eat here or at one of his other restaurants.  What a treat!

Please comment and follow me for more reviews! I would love to have you!"}
{"text":"Great food all around. Love the tomato salad with blue cheese, the king salmon was awesome, sturgeon fish was outstanding. 

Service needs a bit of work. Nothing bad, just be happier.


Nice place."}
{"text":"The only disappointing thing with my visit to Lola is that Iron Chef Michael Symon was in New York at Food Network taping one of the shows that he stars in.  My wife and I started with a charcueterie board as our appetizer.  The meats were amazing especially the pork rillette. A definite must.  I ordered the pork chop that is a signature dish and it was incredible with the cheesy polenta and bbq onions.  My wife had the duck which I had a taste of as well and it was just as amazing.  One heck of a good meal and great service too.  Look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"So this would be my third time going to Lola, and I have to admit, the more I go, the more I am becoming a fan of this place.  So most recently I took advantage of the restaurant week menu offered this week for dinner, and I was quite pleased with my overall experience.  

The Restaurant Week menu offered three courses:  I chose the cauliflower soup as my first course, the beef hangar steak for my entree, and the Napoleon for my dessert.  The cauliflower soup was creamy and delicious, a perfect entry into my dining experience there.  The steak followed, along with a large cup of Rosemary fries.  My medium rare steak was cooked just to my taste: tender, juicy, and red in the middle.  The fries were good as usual (if you haven't had fries at one of Michael Symon's restaurants, they are worth a try just for funsies), although I was disappointed that they did not come along with his spicy ketchup (but I admit, I didn't ask for it!).  I had the Napoleon for my dessert, with some of my friends ordering the panna cotta for theirs.  I have to admit, neither dessert quite fit the picture that originally came to my head when the dessert was described on the menu.  Both appeared more to be a layer of cake with a layer of cream (or in the case of the panna cotta, I suppose a layer of panna cotta?), and some additional flair.  My \"napoleon\" was a layer of chocolate cake, a layer of almond cream, with a small scoop of coconut sorbet on top and a crunchy topper that appeared to be made of caramel.  All together, the dessert was quite delicious.  However, when first described as a \"napoleon\", I would have expected some sort of dessert made with puff pastry rather than what I had actually gotten.  All in all, though, this was a very small criticism for what was overall a very pleasant dinner experience.  I felt the food was well worth the money for restaurant week, and the quality has not diminished since the last time I have dined there.  

Besides the food, the restaurant had a great atmosphere  The waitstaff were very professional and seemed capable of handling a very busy restaurant (especially during restaurant week) with apparent ease.

I'd say all three times I've been to Lola, I've enjoyed the food and felt that the quality and quantity of food that is given is very fitting for the price."}
{"text":"One of Cleveland's finest.  East Fourth is just a great place to be on a Saturday evening.  Its a pretty part of town and this is the areas finest establishment.  The pork chop and polenta is delicious.  The scallops are excellent also.  The service is top notch and the whole dining experience is very pleasant.  They have valet parking for 8$."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant in terms of appearance and ambience. In particular I thought the bar surface, which is lighted underneath the \"marble-like\" surface was lovely. 

I sat at the bar and was promptly provided with an iPad bar menu. I tried the Manhattan and it was quite good.

For dinner I started with the beef cheek pierogi which was outstanding. I ordered the hanger steak medium rare as so many have recommended. It is topped with a pickle sauce which provided a tangy addition. The steak was cooked to my satisfaction although I found it slightly over salted. The Lola fries are cooked in duck fat, or so I was told by a frequent diner at the bar, and are rosemary flavored ... they were outstanding! Served in a paper cone inside a metal cup, they remained warm throughout my meal.

All in all, a delightful evening."}
{"text":"I love Michael Symon with a passion.  Really the man is adorable, funny, and borders on brilliant when he giggles.  He understands that everything is better when drenched in pig fat, and that bacon is best when super crispy.  He knows that food is supposed to look good, but also be comforting, and that portion control is the way to go without making it so small you annoy the customer. 
Now that the preamble is over, we can move on to my visit to Cleveland.  I cannot say I adore Cleveland, but given that sooner rather than later I will be living there for a year, I wanted to explore what would be the best part of being there-Michael Symon.
My Yana made reservations for 10 pm on Friday night, and we almost slept through them as both of us were exhausted.  Luckily Ruby woke us in time and we rushed to make it-which we did.  Seated and with a martini in hand, I perused the menu I had longed to hold in my hand.  It did not disappoint.  Beef cheek pierogies with horseradish creme fraiche, crispy sweetbreads, salmon duck, steak, pork.  All the things I knew the Iron Chef would do well.  
The sweetbreads blew me out of the water.  Usually they are small and over breaded but these came in large succulent pieces and were breaded just right, served piping hot with a sauce that cut the richness.  Decadence at its best.  The pierogies were also excellent-all that and more.
For a main I had the salmon, Yana had the hangar steak with fries, and Ruby opted for the duck.  The portions were just right, and the food was nothing short of spectacular.  The fresh salmon with bright garbanzo beans, the amazing sauce with the steak, the duck-although I don't like duck-was insanely good!
For dessert we had the 6 am special.  Maple bacon ice cream.  Need I say more?
Michael Symon, if you were not married-sigh, but you are-but if you weren't there would be no chance.  You would be barefoot in the kitchen cooking for me."}
{"text":"Completely loved it!  And all we had was lunch...

To start:  House Charcuterie, a board filled with italian meats, toast points, mustard, 

For lunch:  a Lola Burger with thin crispy fries.

To wash down the yumminess:  a German Reisling, can't remember the name of it."}
{"text":"We traveled to Cleveland to see Coldplay.  Check out Coldplay in concert and Lola tout suite! We couldn't get reservations so we arrived at the restaurant at about 5:10PM (they open at 5PM) and the bar was packed!  Lucky for us it was mostly folks just waiting for their tables so we were able to have dinner at the bar.  Robert and Steven were the best bartenders we could ask for.  They give you the cocktail menu on an iPad for you to review and are very willing to give you both drink and dinner suggestions.  We started off with the Beef Cheek Pierogi based upon repeated suggestions from fellow patrons and it did not disappoint.  I had several Plum Sours to drink which I highly recommend.  In fact, I would suggest the rest of the drinks on their cocktail menu as well I just can't remember their names at the moment.  For dinner we shared the Sea Scallops.  Who can say no to pork belly?! All in all a wonderful precursor to a fabulous evening in Cleveland.  Cleveland rocks!"}
{"text":"The food is very sophisticated and approachable.  Everything works together in harmony.  Fantastic food to be sure.  The prices make this a special event place in my book."}
{"text":"I'm a recent transplant from Philadelphia, a city that possesses one of the nation's most vibrant and competitive restaurant scenes. Center City Philadelphia is dominated by innumerable BYOB's, Stephen Starr's 12 upscale landmarks, and several large independent establishments such as Morimoto (of Iron Chef fame). As a newly-minted Clevelander, I've been very curious to learn how Cleveland's restaurant scene compares to Philly's, and Lola would be my first opportunity to get my feet wet.

Lola certainly offers a more hip and upscale vibe than say, The Cheesecake Factory in Beachwood. The interior designers who converted the first floor of an old office building/warehouse in downtown Cleveland into an upscale bistro have done a decent job recreating a sophisticated urban feel in a decidedly un-urban downtown. However, I was a bit disappointed by how many patrons they tried to seat in this place. With so many people, Lola's quite noisy for a restaurant that isn't a sportsbar - which makes it a bit tougher to have a conversation than you'd like. This might be a good thing if you're the quiet type and on a blind date, I suppose.

The service at Lola was satisfactory, though not exactly stellar - my guess is that the ratio of customers to servers is a bit closer to what you'd see at Chili's and that the servers are therefore a bit overworked. 

We started our evening with two appetizers - a popular beef cheek pierogi and a braised berkshire bacon. The beef cheek pierogi had an overly mushy consistency and a sauce that was a bit too overpowering. On the other hand, the braised berkshire bacon was superb - with just the right hint of smokiness and complex textures to delight your mouth.

For dinner, I went with Lola's Duck entree. Excellent side of green beans, scallions and almonds. The duck however, was a study in contrasts - excellent flavor, but incredibly difficult to chew and swallow. I was shocked that duck could ever be this tough - I could've sworn that each slice was at least 1/3 sinews. I was left with such a tired jaw and painful teeth trying to consume my dinner that I literally had to leave several pieces of duck on my plate.  I can't remember ever having to do this before. 

Although I was a bit disappointed in my first experience at Lola, I hope to try this establishment again - perhaps I caught them on a bad day. Lola has a lot of promise, and also room to grow and improve, too - a bit like Cleveland."}
{"text":"Stuck in Northern Ohio for a few weeks for work, this place was # 1 on my food priority list.  I had high expectations about this place going in, and for the most part, those expectations were met.

I had the beef cheek pierogi and the pork belly appetizers.  The pierogi was pretty good.  I liked the horseradish sauce.  I liked the dish, but if and when I come back, I probably would try a different appetizer before returning to this one.  The pork belly was the star of the meal.  It was really great.  It had a sauce that candied the outer layer of the belly.  Wonderfully delicious.  I've eaten pork belly at a lot of places, and this belly was as good as I can remember eating.

For the entree I had the hangar steak.  I was perfectly cooked and very tender.  I really liked the pickle sauce and there was a nice spiciness to the dish.  I would definitely get it again.

The dessert was french toast with maple bacon ice cream.  I thought it was pretty good, but maybe a bit too heavy for me.  I felt like the french toast could have been more lightly fried.  It was ok, but again I probably wouldn't get it again.

The prices here are quite reasonable for the quality of food that you receive.  Service was fine.  It's a very good meal."}
{"text":"Top notch!
Service was exceptional. Food was delicious. I'm vegetarian and there was only one choice in the entree section. That was a little on the bummer side but not nearly enough reason to change my rating from a 5'er. The one choice I did have was so wonderfully tasty it doesn't matter if it was all I could have. I didn't need another choice.

Great wine selection and desserts. I have to say I loved that there was a cheese plate option for the dessert. I'm not vegan so I ordered that in favor of a sweet dessert. It was UNBELIEVABLE, the bread bites they make are so yum yum.

DO IT!!!"}
{"text":"So they have a drink menu on an ipad.  Big freaking deal.  I found Lola to be way overpriced for the quality of food received.  Basically, you are paying high prices to say you ate at a celebrity chef's restaurant.  I'd prefer to pay to eat delicious food.  That did not happen at Lola.

Items:

Bread that comes to the table is very blah.  If it's not great bread, I'd prefer no bread at all.  Why take the hit for carbs and waste valuable stomach space on bland bread?

Cocktails - good cocktails.  They were $10-12, but I think worth the price.  However, don't order one just to use the ipad menu.  The ipad menu is stupid.  You can play with my ipad for 2 minutes and I'll only charge you $5.

Pork belly appetizer - pork belly is always delicious, and the pork rinds on top with hot-wing type sauce were a great compliment, as were the celery greens with blue cheese dressing.  This was my dinner, and I'm glad I chose it.  The portion of pork belly is very generous and it is easily a dinner if you also order an appetizer or dessert.

Duck fries - WAY better duck fries in Cleveland at Bar Cento.

Scallops - just fine, but good lord, for just fine I could pay half the price!

Short rib - average.  See scallops review above.

Desserts - good!  The maple bacon ice cream is the standout.  But - be forewarned - we split this dessert among three people, and each got 1 and 1/2 very small bites of ice cream.  It's a mini scoop - I estimate 1/3 or 1/4 the size of a scoop you'd get on an ice cream cone.  I wish I could get away with charging $6 for 5 bites of ice cream!  I guess if I had a show on Food Network I could.

All in all, I would say Lola was not worth the time or money.

This is only my second experience dining at a restaurant owned by a Food Network star, but it may be my last.  These guys/ladies don't have time to put into their own restaurants - they're very busy with TV shows, appearances, etc.  I think they're a money trap.  My two cases in point are Lola and Mario Batali's Lupo in NYC, which wasn't just average - it was downright disgusting.

If you're into food tv, skip the celebrity restaurants and go to some of the places they mentioned back in the day on DDD or Best Thing I Ever Ate - before they started running out of awesome places and are just looking to fill a few days in a city.  My favorite place in Cleveland was Lucky's Diner.  LOVED IT!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing, potato leek soup was unlike anything like it I've ever had in terms of flavor intensity. Calves heart was like super tender rare steak, sliced. Dessert was the best carrot cake I've had. Just an amazing experience.
If possible, don't miss sitting at the chef's table watching the cooks work, quite the show. As good as I had hoped for on the plane from LA. $70 for three courses, a belgian ale and dessert wine is unobtainable back home for this level of quality.
Disclosure: I am a huge fan of the chef, and went to Cleveland primarily to try his restaurants, so I'm fairly described as biased. I can't recommend Lola enough."}
{"text":"I'd really say 3 and a half. We went here on our trip to the land of Cleves because the chef won the Iron Chef competition and the place is supposed to be the shiznit. The service was spot on--though I had a sneaking suspicion that our server was trying to \"up-sell\" us on some menu items. which I'd expect more from a TGI Fridays than from a restaurant this well regarded. Definitely not a lot of veg/vegan options, not that I'm one but I am a friend. The room was crowded and noisy, a bit flashy. Love the open kitchen. The cocktails, at least the ones we had,  were overpriced and not that good. The mains were quite good, no doubt about it. But do me a favor--skip the bacon ice cream, no matter how tempted you might be. It's really just bacon in ice cream. The restaurant is on a restaurant row of sorts, with a few bars thrown in for good measure. It's an easy walk from many of the downtown hotels."}
{"text":"Pig Ears....need I say more?  We had a party of six and were seated at a booth type rounded table near the rear...A perfect spot to talk around the table and to share and enjoy the great food.  Everything is inventive and the flavors are great.  We tried the entire menu and nothing disappointed, down to the cookies with crackled milk and brioche french toast with maple bacon ice cream...It warmed the cool rainy Cleveland evening.  The bar area is stunning...That's enough reason to check this venue out."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent presentation, I tried everyone at my table's dishes and what was truly amazing was that everything was exceptional.  Don't normally order dessert, but there were all tremendous, this is a world class restaurant.

Some other reviewer complained because they didn't spend hours preparing for her allergies -- she needs to live in a bubble, because you won't find many places that put this much thought and consideration into their menu.  The most discriminating critic couldn't give Lola's less than 4 stars, it really is an exceptional experience in Ohio."}
{"text":"Though the by the glass wine list could use some help, the bar service and execution of appetizers were spot on. Something tells me I'll be haunted by those beef cheek pierogies for months. Damn!"}
{"text":"All I can say is that it is worth the trip.  A level of food dining that you will not get just anywhere.  The service was a little abrupt but it was attentive.  They were very busy on a Wednesday and suspect that kept or wait staff from being more engaged.  The dirty martini was the best I have had in a very long time.  The choices were accessible yet exotic and just pulled off perfectly.  Very glad I got to try this culinary experience."}
{"text":"I'll just put it this way: I am an attorney of the semi-respectable sort, and I was in public gnawing the flesh off a pork bone just to get the last vestiges of amazing flavor. Service was great as well.

Also, their drink menus are on iPads.... Who does that?"}
{"text":"Lola was quite a surprise and gave my friends and I the most memorable dining experience in Cleveland. The food was wonderful, the portions just right, and the service was far above average. The wait staff was attentive, helpful and friendly but never overbearing or pushy. Our waitress's dessert recommendations were spot on and finished off an incredible meal. 

Thank you Lola!"}
{"text":"We walked into Lola thinking that we were going to just stay for appetizers. However, the second we walked in the door we were overwhelmed that this was the place we were going to stay for the entire evening. The food was fabulous five star over-the-top the service was impeccable and on point.  The atmosphere was elegant and amazing.  We had such a great time here in the most perfect seats in the house. Okay I know what you really want to hear we're going to tell you.

This place is absolutely wonderful the staff the atmosphere and the food is absolutely delightful. We had the Dover sole yes it is from Dover, France.  It was exquisite and if you're with another person I would advise that you split it. We are now getting ready for dessert and will have more comments later. If you're looking for a wonderful evening come to Lola."}
{"text":"Nothing but great things to say. Terrific food, wonderful ambiance, fantastic service. I love Lola!"}
{"text":"Been going since their Tremont days. I've tried a lot of dishes I wouldn't normally have any where else. But I trust that everything on the menu will be delicious. They've never disappointed. Scallops and \"The Fred Flinstone\" are my favorites."}
{"text":"This place is located in a very vibrant area, lots of good food spots all around and the is some, not a lot outside seating. The only bummer is if you sit outside then you have to deal with all the smokers and there was a fair amount. The service at the bar was great, you can order full menu items everything that was suggested was great. Good atmosphere ,good conversations, good times what more can you ask for."}
{"text":"First visit,  pleasantly surprised.  As reported, beef. Cheek perogies were outstanding w sweetbreads ok. Short ribs were requested to be served with the cheessy polemta rather than the root vegies and it was no problem. Good request az both rated tops and deservedly so. Duck was too rare and thickly. Cutt so chewy but my companion liked it. Dessert was excellent. Panacotta to die for. The staff was especially accommodating,  pleasant and attentive but not snobby. Nice watching each dish prepared in the open kitchen. Lighting could be a bit better.  Dinner for 2 with 1 beer and 1 capuccino $125."}
{"text":"The Hubs and I recently traveled to Cleveland to see U2 and the Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame. We are HUGE Michael Symon fans so before we even had U2 or plane tickets in hand, we made a reservation at Lola. It did not disappoint. The restaurant itself is very dark and cozy in the best way with big booths and banquet seating for smaller tables. The setting is very inviting although a little loud at times. The service was spot on and we had a very indulgent and friendly waitress who endured lots of questions from us. We both started with a cocktail their version of a Manhattan. It was delicious with a citrus after-note. Food wise, we started with the potato pave which were thinly cut rectangles of potato topped with caviar, creme fraiche, capers and horseradish. This app was really outstanding--the potato was crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. The capers added some acid and worked well with the creaminess of the creme fraiche. The caviar took it to the next level. The portion size was nice but not too large to spoil our dinner. We really enjoyed it and would order it again. 

We split the shaved vegetable crudo which the kitchen kindly split onto two plates for us. This was a great palate cleanser and my husband enjoyed it more than more. The name crudo intrigued me and I was expecting the vegetables to be cut into small pieces. Instead, the vegetables (radish, carrot, arugula, beets) were thinly cut into long pieces and topped with feta and a red wine vinaigrette. It was good but I would think about trying something else next time.

For the entree course, I ordered the lamb shank and it literally fell off the bone. They brought me a steak knife, but no knife was needed. The portion size was very generous and the lamb was well seasoned and tender. It sat on a bed of tzatziki and pita chips with grilled rapini. So good!! My husband had the hanger steak with Lola fries. The steak cooked well and very well seasoned and tender. The fries (there were a ton) were crispy and piping hot. 

Finally, we could not resist dessert and settled on the sticky toffee pudding with cream cheese ice cream. The dessert was good, but not as good as the other items. The \"pudding\" is more like a bread pudding and a little on the dense side. The ice cream was delicious and a perfect complement to the cake. As a dessert, it was not overly sweet which appealed to me especially after a big meal. 

Overall, we loved dining here and would absolutely return if we come back to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"All I can say is \"wow\"!  The poke ahi tuna ceviche w/ pineapple and jalapeño was incredible, as was the beet salad with goat cheese and pistachios and the steelhead trout with carrot and Maitake mushrooms in a citrus sauce.  Then, the chocolate peanut butter pretzel dessert (and the 6am Special w/ french toast and bacon ice cream, which I got to sample from a friend's plate) were amazing.  Lastly, the wines by the glass were solid - i had the 2007 Damiano Barolo.  5 stars - there is a reason why this place was full along a street of mostly empty restaurants and bars!"}
{"text":"Ok if this was normal restaurant I would have given 5 but because it is a fine dinning I have judge it accordingly .
Ambiance good 
Wine collection awesome 
We arrived immediately seated. Very cordial staff. Drinks came shortly. Here is where they lose a point. They have average selection of single malts for a high end restaurant on top I believe any fine dinning if they don't have single large ice cubes for single malt is not good . So they had multiple small cubes of ice... 
But the main thing is food .. N my god the food was just awesome . Their deserts are top notch ..all in all a great experience......"}
{"text":"We were in Cleveland this last weekend for a friend's wedding, and stopped in after a friend from LA recommended we do so. Very happy we did. We sat toward the back of the main dining room near the open air kitchen. 

Apps: kale salad and albacore crudo. The kale salad was just okay; we didn't really enjoy the, on the heavy side, ranch-like dressing. The crudo was amazing. We could have ate a few more orders of that and called it a wrap. But thankfully, we ordered some other great dishes.
Entrees: pork chop - very generous portion, and very tasty. Served with a creamy corn polenta and a cranberry sauce. 
Salmon - it was amazing. Cooked perfectly, and the flavor was phenomenal. A slightly crispy outside, and a medium rare inside.  
Drinks: enjoyed a great martini. The Zinfandel from San Luis Obispo was very good. Typical spice/pepper you expect from a zin, but more fruit forward than I'm used to experiencing from this varietal, and that made for a nice combination. 
The restaurant has a great layout/decor, and you can't help but be drawn to the beautiful bar. 
Only drawback and probable reason for why I wanted to give four stars instead of 5 is that the waitress seemed unhappy to be serving us. Maybe due to us coming in for a 10:00pm reservation, she seemed rather short with us and uninterested in making us have a great experience. But alas, we still had a wonderful dinner and would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"A little late writing this review....visited here in July 2012 while in town visiting friends. The place was HOPPING!  Had martinis at the bar while waiting for our table which were wonderful! Fun bartenders.   Had fish dish which was delish! Hubby had a steak which he really liked as well!  A bit on the pricey side but worth the splurge!"}
{"text":"I had been excited to try out this place for quite a while as I am a big fan of Michael Symon. The restaurant itself is beautiful with an open kitchen. They have a very cool drink list that they let you look through on an IPad, that is a first for me, but a unique way to peruse the cocktails and drinks. We both enjoyed our cocktails, strong and tasty. 
For appetizers we had the beef cheek pierogi, I enjoyed it. They split it into 2 plates for us since we were sharing, 2/15$ a little pricey but glad i tried it. The star was the horseradish cream sauce it came with. For entrees i choose the Steak Frites, Hanger Steak. It was cooked perfect and came with a nice rich sauce. The Lola fries are great, i have had them before at BSpot, they are coated with Rosemary and Parmesan. My date had the Lamb shank, it was huge, rich and delicious. Too much for one sitting, we took the rest home. We were too full for dessert but they gave us passion fruit truffles with the check which were tasty and a great finish. 
The service was impeccable the entire night, our server Tiffany was very helpful, offered to take our picture, and told us about their chef table that we inquired about. She told us you can sit at the chef table in front of the open kitchen and get a tasting menu at 14$ per course, minimum 3 courses. Sounds cool, may try it next time. She also did a great job explaining the dishes and how they are prepared. The only downside of the whole night was the temperature of the dining room, it was very hot, I had to remove my sport-jacket but was still sweating. On top of that the chair is a leathery/vinyl cushion which made me extra sweaty and stuck to the seat. A great night minus the swamp ass by the end of the meal. Not enough to deter me though, I will be back again for another great night of fine dining."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants downtown. Usually reserved for a special occasion. The hanger steak and Lola fries are to die for. I am a creature of habit and get it every time!"}
{"text":"We had really been looking forward to this meal. We tried an appetizer, beef cheek perogie and were not impressed. It was served lukewarm.in addition, our waiter had halitosis, which isnot something I can ever remember noting at a restaurant. 

The bread was not fresh and was tough. When I asked about the meat used,  I was really disappointed to find out that the beef was not grass fed. I expected a top of the line experience but it did not deliver :("}
{"text":"We visited from Dallas.  Fantastic meal.  We took our kids 10 and 13.  We ordered the beef cheek and lobster appetizers, scallops, cod and calves heart entrees.   All were wonderful and the kids enjoyed it.  We all loved the calves heart- even our oldest who is really picky!   Good portions for the price.   Great meal!"}
{"text":"Overall, a decent dining experience. Had a reservation for a group at 9:15. Arrived on time and did have to wait a few minutes for our table to be available, but not too long.

Menu was interesting, although somewhat disappointing that vegetarian options were extremely limited. Even the fries are cooked in pork fat. I do eat seafood and was dying to try the scallops but they came wrapped in pancetta. Michael Symon loves his cow products. But I will say that our server was very knowledgeable about the menu items and was careful to warn us of which items seemed like they would be vegetarian but were actually not. If you have any dietary issues, make sure to mention them to your server here.

I ordered the Goat Cheese Onion Tart, which was delicious...a very mild goat cheese cooked to perfection. I also got the Summer Vegetables entree. It was incredibly small and not filling at all, but tasty. Drink selection was great, servers was excellent.

Overall, I think it's a bit pricey for what you actually get, but I wouldn't be against dining here again."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for a wedding and had a free night for dinner. Decided to search out Lola with a friend because of Michael Symon's reputation and was not let down.

The restaurant was modern and warm, hostess was hot (always nice), and the wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable. We started off with a bottle of Carmenere from Chile, I only kinda know what that means... it was red and it made me a little drunk and sleepy (which is all I can ask for).  

For starters we split the Braised Bacon (great flavor but I'm still not used eating legit hunks of fat) and the Charcuterie (fell a little flat). Things kept getting better from there though with the Arctic Char w/ ham hock risotto (delicious, as porky as a fish entree can get) and the Lamb Heart with favas and morels (amazing... had to take a moment of silence and it pushed me to 5 stars). To finish was the 6AM special which was french toast with maple bacon ice cream (I mean come on... how could you not). 

Great meal, great restaurant."}
{"text":"Visiting from Portland Oregon and had such a nice meal here. The wine selection is great with helpful bar staff. I had the halibut - wonderful! Love this place."}
{"text":"Really nice spot located on Cleveland's famed East 4th street. I never really thought of Cleveland as having much of a night life, but I was wrong, East 4th is as lively of a street as I've ever been to. 

We started off with a Potato Pave and a Crab Bake. The Potato Pave was light and delicious, it had caviar on top given it a nice salty, seafood flavour. The Crab Bake was nice but light on actual crab, it was also much spicier than expected. I enjoyed it but it was too spicy for my wife. 

For entrees we had the Autumn Vegetables and the Tuna Tartare Nicoise for sides we had Mushrooms and Cauliflower. The Cauliflower was delicious but very rich. The Mushrooms were tasty with lots of garlic and salt, the portion size was large. The Autumn Vegetables was a very nice dish, think pot roast flavours, but without the meat. The Tuna Tartare Nicoise was a very small dish and too acidic, it was below our expectations. 

We skipped desert but I did enjoy a Whiskey Britches Manhattan which I'd highly recommend to any Whiskey drinker. 

Overall it was a very nice meal on the patio of a fun street in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Lola for Lunch.  I work downtown, and eat here pretty regularly.  I love have tried a large portion of the lunch menu, and have yet to be disappointed.  

I love the Lola Burger, which comes with Lola fries and a special ketchup.  I also like  to get the asparagus with my burger sometimes, and can honestly say that I have never had asparagus taste as good as it does from Lola.  I have tried the Mac and cheese, which has chicken and goat cheese in it and loved it.  I would however consider it to be more of a pasta and sauce then a mac and cheese, but either way it tasted amazing.  I highly recommend trying the seasonal soups, I have tried about 4 different ones so far and have savored each one.  When the waiter/waitress describes them they sound a bit pretentious, but they all have tasted amazing.  

The wait staff are great and very attentive.  I would recommend reservations, even at lunch for larger parties."}
{"text":"Considering this is Iron Chef's restaurant, I really expected that I wouldn't find anything no menu I'd like, it's be way outside my budget, and I'd have to go to nearest McD's (kidding) to fill myself up.  Now, I was very impressed with the atmosphere (not as uppity as I imagined), food quality (wow was it good! and I was even full afterwards), and service (our waittress greeted everyone at table and gave us the full spiel each time someone arrived).  We went for lunch and was very satisfied and happy after the meal.

I'd say it's the best restaurant in its class that I've gone too (in terms of upscale/sheik place) recently....definitely on par with other upscale restaurants I've gone to around the world."}
{"text":"Michael Symon.  Thank you for a wonderful feast.  No appetizers needed just dove right into the main course(center cut pork chop). Tenderly cooked and just a hint of chili peppers.  So yummy.  Dessert was a homemade peppermint Pattie.  Go there!"}
{"text":"Not that this place needs another glowing review, but here I go anyway because this was a great dinner!

We made a reservation (for my birthday), and they were not put out by my calling that night letting them know we were running late (about 15 minutes late with parking). The greeters, the bus boy, the wait staff - every one was upbeat and nice. The open kitchen was fun to see - and note to self, next time reserve the seating that faces into the kitchen. Its like dinner and a show!

The iPad drink list is a little fancy, but fun! It was nice to have the back-lit drink menu to light up our table, since its a little dark in the restaurant. This was our first time here, but not our first time to a Michael Symon restaurant having enjoyed dinner at Roast in Detroit several times. The waitress took her time explaining the menu and was able to answer any questions we had, and was helpful in selecting our dishes.

We started with the tuna poke and the bay scallops - both were great. If it were a competition though - the bay scallops won. Both were really great though, and perfectly balanced in flavors and textures.  

Next we had the smoked pork chops and the steelhead trout. The porkchops packed a flavor punch in the BBQ sauce, and the trout had a more subtle flavor, again both were great! 

We ordered the 6am dessert, but was treated with a bite size chocolate cupcake on a plate with Happy Birthday written out in raspberry filling. Yum! The 6am did not disappoint either! The brioche french toast was like eating a churro. And I could not stop raving about the maple bacon ice cream! This ice cream is a fat kid (or pregnant lady) 's dream come true! First the intense sweet maple flavor, and then the salty smokey bacon. I think I'm still drooling. I could have eaten an entire pint of just that ice cream!

Some people might be put off by the portion sizing, since there will be no leftovers from this meal - but I like to be able to eat everything on my plate as its meant to be eaten. I also come to a place like this wanting to have three courses with out having to un-button or waddle out.

This was a great dining experience, and one I would quickly agree to repeat despite the cost - cause it was WORTH it! 

Note: I saw a family with their kids (8-10ish) and while I personally would not pay $30 for my kid to eat an entree it was not an issue as they were well behaved. I would not recommend for younger kids though."}
{"text":"Delicious. Nice beer selection. We had Samuel smiths organic lager and 3 Floyds Dark Lord. We started with the beef cheek pirogues- great beef flavor, tender. Scallops with prosciutto and white asparagus - yum. Lamb loin with fava beans, artichoke bottoms - yum. Desserts also yum. Service was spot on."}
{"text":"Wait! Is this a \"frou-frou\" spot in Cleveland?! Am I back home in NYC?!

We tried this spot based on personal recommendations and Yelp reviews. Not a major fail, but I definitely left less than thrilled to have patronized this establishment. 

The hostesses were pretty snobby. We had to wait for about 15 minutes to be seated, even though we had reservations on a MONDAY night. When the hostess walked by with menus in hand and announced our reservation, there were no apologies for the wait or any notification that we should follow her so we could be seated at our table - logic kicked in and we figured that when she mentioned our group by name that we should follow her to our table! Such behavior was the reason why I felt like I may have been at a restaurant in some \"trendy\" section at home in NYC rather than down the street from the stadium where Cleveland's baseball team plays! The seating hostess's one redeeming quality - she offered the coat check (but only to the one man in our group, not anyone else with jackets!). Oy!

Our waitress, bless her heart, rushed us to order. Almost literally as soon as we were seated she wanted to know our dessert order. And no, this is not a concept restaurant where dessert is served first!!  

I tried the duck because I LOVE duck! I LOVE IT! I didn't like it here - maybe it was the lack of seasoning on the meat or maybe something else, but whatever it was, tasty was NOT it! Asparagus was on the menu. I LOVE asparagus, but oops! They were no longer serving asparagus on Monday night, so I settled for roasted potatoes and caramelized onions. (Completely lackluster and I wasn't expecting much because I already knew it was a boring combination!) 

I wish I could have enjoyed this restaurant especially since the reviews, both personal and Yelp, made this space seem like it would be worth a visit when in Cleveland. Unfortunately, not so much!!!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I went on a Wednesday evening at 6. Parked in the nearest lot for $10!  However, we should have parked in the parking deck on corner across from the Q, cause after dinner we ended up walking down to horseshoe casino, and if have a players card and play for at least a half hour, parking in that deck is free! 
A little less then half the tables were full upon entry.  As the hostess brought us to the back corner area where there seemed to be a lot of 2 seater tables along the wall and a few scattered around, she proceeded to sit us right in the middle next to a business party of 8... Um, I don't think so!  I asked her nicely if we could sit at one of the other 2 seater tables away from the party and she gladly let us. But really? With all the options... Anyway.  Staff was friendly.  Upon request for a martini list, they gave us an iPad to browse the liqueurs and mixed drinks.  Which was nice because the screen was lit up and u can see it.  But once I tried to look at my menu I realized just how dark it was in there!  So dark, that I noticed a group that came in and sat a few tables away had people using the flashlights on their phones to read the menus!  My hubby and I had a hard time eating our steak and pork chops to determine what was the fatty parts we need to cut off!  And yes, I did eat some unpleasant fatty parts just cause I could not see them! Either they are trying to diminish your sense of sight to maybe enhance your spence of taste, they are saving money on electricity or they don't want you taking pictures of their food!

On to the food.  After ordering, they do bring a basket of bread and butter.  Mmm, crusty on the outside, soft on the inside, delish bread.  I ordered the sidecar drink and it was good.  My hubby got his typical Long Island and I tasted it, and it was the worst one I ever had, I'm not exaggerating!  He ended up drinking it anyway and then getting the sidecar too.  We ordered the beef cheek pierogies. OMG, They were delectable!  You get 2, and they are a descent size.  But take small bites and savor it!!!  Entrees: I got the smoked pork chops with a polenta.  I'm not usually a fan if smokey flavored stuff, but this was very subtle, and the pork was so tender, and with the light flavored bbq'd onions mixed with polenta on each bite if pork was outstanding!  Hubby got the ribeye and it was cooked to perfection and had a wonderful taste!  He did ask for a side of horseradish sauce that came on top of the pierogies, but really, that's the way he likes his steak, but by itself was great!  
Now dessert.  When ordering, I told my hubby he could choose cause it was his b-day and I just wanted a bite. The server heard me, and brought out a plate that said 'happy birthday' in a red dessert sauce and  a mini chocolate cupcake with I think was a pistachio frosting and a candle.  Fun, the candle was the type that keeps relighting after blown out.  The cupcake was a bit dry and frosting not that great.  For our dessert we order, \"Dark Chocolate Sesame
dark chocolate ganache, porcini caramel, bruleed banana, black sesame cake, milk chocolate sesame ice cream\" (word for word of menu) for $9.  DO NOT get this!  You will be disappointed!  The presentation was sort of a deconstructed bits and pieces all over the plate.  You get 2 slices of bruleed bananas, just 2!  With this snake of rubbery ganache that looks like it was pressed through a play-doh press.  2 quarter sized sesame disks that really did not go with the other flavors, 3 dots of the caramel, and a tablespoon of the ice cream in the corner on top of a half dollar sized brownie less than a 1/4 inch tall.  Not good folks. All other reviews said the 6am dessert was good, we should have listened.  Oh, and their water tasted good, I have to throw that out there since I've been in places where it can be quite foul.  In all, I recommend, and I will be back to try other dishes since the appetizer and entrees were stellar!"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING here! 

My boyfriend and I ordered the Braised Pork Chop and Braised Lamb Shank. They were SO delicious! The meat was nice and tender. The flavor of the pork chop was just perfect! The combination of pork chop and polenta tasted amazing! The lamb shank was so tender! The meat just fell off the bones. The flavor was amazing as well! 

The portion of the entrees looked small in pictures, but they are actually quite big in real life. So, ordering an entree should be more than enough for someone with normal appetite. 

We also tried their creme brûlée, and it was really delicious too. They added fruits on top of the creme brûlée, which made it taste even better. The portion of the brûlée was pretty small, but it's probably the perfect size since you'll be pretty full after eating one of their entrees. 

I definitely recommend this place! Definitely try the pork chop and lamb shank if you get a chance!"}
{"text":"Had a late dinner at Lola last night for two and it was amazing!  We were greeted promptly and treated excellently by the wait staff.  Our meal started off with  an offer of fresh bread and butter.  We ordered two different appetizers, my boyfriend ordered the bone marrow appetizer and I ordered the beef cheek pierogi.  Both were amazing.  Excellent choices for starters.  For our entrees he got the hanger steak with pickle sauce served with Lola fries and we opted for a side of hollandaise sauce.  My entree was the sea scallop with leeks, bacon, pork belly, potatoes, served with beurre blanc sauce.  So in a way surf and turf style was how we had dinner.  Hands down one the best meals we've ever had.  The steak and scallops were perfectly cooked.  We ended our meal with a dessert we shared a honey and goat cheese ice cream with a cup of French press coffee.  We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I were visiting her dad in Toledo on Aug 30th. We had planned on driving into Cleveland  the next day to check out the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame building and if possible, stop at Lola for a quick drink and an appetizer or four.  The R&R visit took us a long time and we were not sure as to Lola's rules so by 5:30PM when the museum closed, I decided to call ahead before wasting the trip there. 

I explained our situation to Rachel, who answered the phone. We were just visiting Cleveland for the R&R and possibly stop by Lola since we're big fans of Michael Symon.  I mentioned how we were dressed for a day at the museum since we weren't sure would be ok if they had a dress code.  Remember, I am describing how all of us were very casual and did not want to bother if their dress code was more strict.  But after checking with someone for a few seconds, Rachel comes back and tells me that it will be fine and asked me when did I think I was going to be in.  I told her it would be 5-10 minutes from my location but also asked if I needed to make a reservation. She said that she would take my name just in case and then said \"Come on in\".

We headed to Lola and were able to find a spot to park on the street about two blocks away.  I was a little concerned since my GF's dad has a bad hip and the walk seemed a little far but we headed there anyway as we intended to try this raved spot once and for all.  As we neared the door I kept an eye on people's attire as I didn't want me and my guests feeling underdressed and out of place. I didn't see anything out of the ordinary and only one gentleman was dressed business-like but the others were all casual. So I was more at ease and proceeded inside.

As we reach the hostess desk, I quickly noticed Rachel was there. I immediately identified myself and and my guests and asked if she was the same lady and she said yes.  However, her smile was very apprehensive and somehow brought on a sense that something was wrong but she didn't get to say anything else as she was interrupted right away by a really bullish woman that took us away from her as quick as she could.  Of course, at this point we thought she was taking us to our table, wouldn't you?  Wrong...

Once this unfriendly woman got us far enough from the front and away from all nearby ears, she continues to let us know that they had given away our table!  No apologies, no niceness.  Just \"no table\" and that was it.  Cold.  I quickly looked around us to see the entire place was not full.  Open tables everywhere.  When she noticed she proceeds to mention that if we want we could seat at the bar (only one chair open and three of us, mind you) OR \"I could have you guys seat over there (points to kitchen counter) which is one of our best tables but someone cancelled and I can make it yours now\".  As irate as we were, we kept our composure and attitude to a minimum, even though we had every right to scream at that point.  I am fairly passive and have tons of control over my patience but this was a bit embarrasing and it was obvious on the face of my guests.  I actually considered seating at that \"best table\" right in front of the extremely noisy, open kitchen for just one reason: I happened to see an episode of Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations where he visits Ohio and has dinner here while in the company of Marky Ramone while being served from behind the counter by the man himself, chef Symon.  BTW, just so you know what I'm talking about, this is no \"table\" ok?  It is a giant counter that sticks out from the open kitchen and hidden away in the back of the place away from all the \"life\" and in front of steamy, sweating guys that are rattling pots and pans from side to side and HOT as hell!

I almost said yes simply for the nostalgia of the show but that was a fast forgotten point.  At this moment we realized we were not welcome and there was no hiding that. We just told her that we'll pass and that was it. We walked right out feeling cheated and disrespected but found a nice, welcoming spot just across the street at the Mexican place called Zocalo, which were more than happy to have us there.

I am sadly turned off at Symon's place and don't even look forward to promoting him anymore as he is after all the one behind the name and the restaurant's character and reputation.  Visit at your own expense..."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago for a birthday dinner. Like other reviews have observed, Lola offers impeccable five-star service. Came on a Wednesday night, there was a 15 minute wait for a table outside so we ordered a few drinks at the bar. Great prices, well-made cocktails, would definitely come back. Perfect location, great seating indoors and out. Foodwise was a mixed bag. The pork fritto misto was good, but not worth the cost. The scallops and sturgeon we ordered were both well-executed and very tasty. Unfortunately nothing throughout the meal screamed \"signature dish\" and was particularity innovative or noteworthy to earn 5 stars. Lola is the type of place you take your parents or grandparents - it's classy without being pretentious, borderline adventurous without being unapproachable, and spendy without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"The food at Lola is phenomenal! So rich, flavorful, fresh, and unique. I have also heard really great things about their wine menu, so I ordered a glass of the Hypothesis \"Roots Run Deep\" Cabernet Sauvignon and it was one of the greatest glasses of wine I have ever had! It was bold yet smooth. 

For dinner, I ordered the Autumn Vegetables with a side of Roasted Potatoes and Caramelized Onions. The coconut milk marinade for the vegetables was the best part of the entree. The potatoes were AWESOME! Probably my favorite part of the entire meal. The seasoning was pretty perfect and potatoes just melted in my mouth. 

For dessert, I ordered the Vanilla Creme Brulee. It was extremely fresh, light, and not too sweet (which is something I prefer). All in all, the perfect dessert to follow a very dense dinner.

I definitely recommend Lola to anyone looking to dine at a high-end restaurant in Cleveland! It is expensive but worth it. I gave this restaurant 4 stars because I think it would be really nice if they had more vegetarian options. It is kind of crazy that they don't have more for such an upscale place."}
{"text":"Somehow I neglected to review one of my most favorite Cleveland dining experiences..so here it goes. I have been here on a couple occasions, for special occasions. I still remember things that I ate and I think that says a lot...especially if it's been a few months or more. 

Michael Symon definitely does not disappoint. From impeccable service to the impeccable food, it's worth every penny and more. This food would have a major upcharge in major cities like NYC and Chicago! 

I remember having the beef cheek pierogi..and wanting seconds. Moist, flavorful, saucy, and a million times better than my regular Mrs. T's! I guess it's not fair to compare the two, but I speak the truth. 
 
I also remember having a raspberry pistachio macaron. Wow. 
And the maple bacon...something. Wow again. 

Also a unique thing about the service is that the menu is on an ipad- everything from apps to drinks is on there. For the type of restaurant this is, Michael could charge a heck of a lot more. Only in the humble city of Cleveland can you get food like that at such fair prices. Love love love!"}
{"text":"This was our second trip to Lola in the last 4 months.   We were in Cleveland in June overnight on our way to a friend's wedding.  We had hoped to do a night out on the town at Lola with some friends, but when their kids got sick we opted to stay in for dinner.  We went to Lola for dessert and IMMEDIATELY regretted that choice.   I had the 6 AM Special, and my partner had the Chocolate Peanut Butter Pretzel dessert.  Both were spectacular.   We immediately made plans to come for my birthday dinner knowing we'd be in CLE in October.

Fast forward to October and the meal did not disappoint.   

The beef cheek pirogies and heirloom tomato salad were delicious starters.  The blue cheese in the heirloom salad had a whipped texture that was light and airy, but still melted in your mouth.   

The hangar steak with pickle sauce and fries, and sea scallops with corn, leek, bacon, and a roasted tomato salad were both to die for.  We both cleaned our plates (minus the huge container of fries) and I couldn't tell you the last time that happened in a restaurant.   

For dessert, we split the chocolate chip.   The crispy milk garnish is one of the most interesting parts of the dessert.   Overall it was delicious, but I would recommend either of the previous desserts we had first.   

I had the Lola Sidecar and Apple and Pear Sangria as cocktails.   Each were delicious, and if you are a sidecar fan there's is not to be missed.

Some notes on service:  We had an 8:45 reservation.  We learned that they do not take reservations on the tables outside.   We went over early as we were hungry and sat right down on a beautiful, fall night outside.  No waiting!  However, if you want to sit inside, reservations on weekends are a must.   

Our dessert took longer than expected as the chef was fresh baking the cookies.  She sent out samples of the house made pumpkin ice cream with our server while we waited, and it was DELICIOUS.   

I did notice the noise level inside was high, but our servers were attentive and kept things moving right along without rushing us.   

Absolutely fantastic experience and would gladly return!"}
{"text":"yep. michael simon does it again. 
great place for a date. romantic. the ambience is perf. 
food=love. 
service is impeccable. i love the little ipad like tools at table for ordering drinks. 
definitely a great place for couples. 
headed downtown for a concert or game, this is a great place to start the night."}
{"text":"Recently we stayed in Cleveland at the Hyatt at the Arcade and from our room window at the back of the hotel we could see a little closed off street type walking mall.  We walked around that evening trying to decide where to eat and ended up (after reading the reviews) going to Michael Symon's Lola.  It was a Friday evening and we had not made reservations (I suggest you do) they did not have any seating available inside but luckily since  it was still rather early they had a few open tables on the patio area.  It was a pleasant evening to be July and there was a talented young man with his dog singing on the patio area next door. I saw in the reviews that some had not liked that but I thought his singing added a little extra to the evening.

We were greeted by our waiter, Brian, and given a tablet from which to order our drinks.  My husband (who is technologically impaired) did not like this feature but I did as I felt eliminating the \"middle man\" so to speak meant that exactly what we ordered was more likely to be delivered since I am assuming the order went straight to the bar rather than the waiter taking the order and then giving it to the bartender, etc.

The menu had a good, if not extensive, selection.  I ordered the chicken which was brined and then roasted. Brian informed us that since everything is cooked to order, it would take about 40 or 45 minutes to prepare if we didn't mind waiting. He assured me it would be worth the wait. My husband ordered the smoked Hampshire pork chop over polenta. Our drinks arrived and we settled in for our wait. 

With the singer next door and the people watching of everyone walking by on the street it really did not seem like it took THAT long and boy, was Brian right! My chicken arrived (along with a chicken sausage)on a bed of mashed Yukon gold potatoes and with a smattering of fava beans, grilled onion and au jus.  It was cooked to perfection and it looked as good as it tasted.  My husband's smoked pork chop was sliced on the cheesy polenta with chiles and bbq onions(I tasted his too).  It was so tender you could cut it with a fork. 

The meal was fabulous but I just couldn't eat it all.  On top of all that, they sent out a complimentary dessert which was also fabulous. It was called the 6 a.m. Special and consisted of Brioche French Toast with maple bacon ice cream and caramelized apples. It had some kind of wafer on top that was great. The thought of bacon and ice cream together did not sound appetizing to me at all but the combination was fantastic!
It was a little on the pricey side but well worth it. Everything, from the décor (inside), to the service (Brian was awesome), to the food was simply amazing. If I ever come back to Cleveland, we are definitely going to Lola!"}
{"text":"Unquestionably the BEST duck I have ever tasted.  Restaurant was kind of loud, but we chocked that up to everyone raving about the food.  I particularly loved searching for a bottle of wine on an iPad.  What a cool way to find just the right bottle!  Might make it worthwhile to travel back to Cleveland."}
{"text":"I'm in Cleveland for work. Tonight, I decided to venture down the street to Lola. I don't really like eating by myself at nice places, but hey, let's go see what the celebrity chef is up to...

I ordered the Smoked Berkshire Pork Chop with cheesy polenta, chiles and BBQ onions. 
When the plate came and it literally had the things listed above, I was like WTH? $28 for this (even though the pork chop was really kind of big). But then I took a bite. The flavors mixed perfectly. I'm going to have to figure out how to make this. 
Service was fine. I always had a full glass of water and got checked on a lot. They brought a banana walnut cookie with the bill, it was really good. 
I'd give 5 stars, but I'm not sure it's worth the price."}
{"text":"Do you have money to spare? An expense account? Looking to impress someone who judges a good meal by the price and not their taste buds? Then Lola might just be your place.
Now don't be mistaken, Lola is good. The food is worth eating and not forgettable. The beef pierogi was tasty, though you wish there was more of it. The hangar steak hits the spot if you're looking for red meat, but just don't look for too much. The cheese polenta that came with it was even better.
It's just you wish there was more. Or at least if you're going to paying $41 for an entree and to split an appetizer that at least you'd leave happier."}
{"text":"Great food, nice service - open kitchen you can see what they are cooking. Ingredients are fresh and tasteful. Great drinks and wine selection as well. Ambience is nice can accommodate friends and couples. Truly loved it"}
{"text":"Excellent fine dining! We had a group of four visiting Cleveland and made reservations to eat here. Well worth it!

My brother went in for the $98 bone-in rib eye for two. LOL! Himself. He's somewhat of a food snob, and he *raved* about this. We all took a little sample. The meat was pure, unobstructed, delicious. Cooked perfectly. Melted on the tongue. 

I had the scallops, which also melted on the tongue.

The service here is exemplary! The ambience is fantastic!

Excellent, Michael Symon, excellent! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"It was good, but not great.  Definitely didn't live up to the Micheal Symon hype.  

The space is really coooool, high, unfinished ceilings give it an urban vibe, alabaster bar glows prettily from beneath.  Staff is soooper-friendly, excellent wine list, diverse bar crowd.  

I had the scallop entree, and while the sauce was tasty, the scallops were lacking.  They were not done enough--they were not pan-fried to caramely goodness and the innards were not quite done.  I will eat scallop sushi, so it didn't squick me out (and I have squicky issues) but it was not what I was expecting, at this caliber of a restaurant, at these prices."}
{"text":"I feel like a lot of places never live up to their hype.  Well, Lola lives up to every good thing you've heard about it.  We went there on a Friday during Restaurant Week.  No problem getting a reservation, surprisingly.  I started off with the Butternut Squash soup that had duck confit in the middle of it.  It was glorious.  I don't even usually like butternut squash soup, but this was simply amazing.  For my entrée I had the hanger steak.  No joke, it was so tender, so perfectly cooked you could have confused it with a filet.  The Lola fries that accompanied the steak were delicious of course.  The only disappointing part of the meal was the dessert.  It was a chocolate bread pudding with salted caramel ice cream.  The ice cream was light and perfectly creamy with a great flavor.  The chocolate bread pudding was overbaked and a little dry and tough.

The drinks were creative and delicious.  Plus they have the drink menu on an iPad!  I had a ginger grapefruit drink which was tasty and went down verrry easy.  I highly recommend getting the wine pairing for an extra 15 bucks with the restaurant week menu.  The wines were all excellent and paired so well with the food.  Much better than what I could have done with my limited knowledge of wine.

The service was wonderful.  The hostesses are welcoming when you check in and take your coat to be checked immediately (if you chose to do so!).  Our serve was so polite, knew the menu extremely well and was able to provide excellent recommendations.  There were three of us at our table and I was impressed that they brought all of our food out at the same time.  They literally had three people bring us the bowls for our soup, followed by three people carrying the soup in little pots to pour into the bowls.  It was quite a show and really made the place stand out.  The manager checked in with us during our meal to make sure all was well, which of course it was.

I would definitely come back here and I would love to bring out of town guests here.  This is definitely a must see in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for one night on business, so that added a lot of stress to the choosing of a restaurant. I ended up walking to 4th street from my hotel (a short walk) and stepped into Lola. I grabbed a seat at the beautifully laid out bar and was promptly handed an iPad with the drinks menu - now that's a menu!

I ordered a Rye Old Fashioned and was very impressed. While many people say there is little difference between the famous cocktail in different places, I completely disagree. This was definitely top 2, fighting for the #1 spot with The Purple Pig in Chicago. Upon discussion with the bartender, I chose the Hangar Steak (I was torn between that and the Ribeye) with a side of Wild Mushrooms.

Wow. The Hangar steak was in-credible. It was juicy, tender, with the perfect char on the outside. The fries were crispy, flavorful, and had /just/ enough salt. The wild mushrooms were borderline addictive. I honestly finished the mushrooms far before either the steak or the fries. 

As a Miami native, Cleveland strikes a sensitive spot (Le Bron!), but I would love to live in Cleveland if only to eat a Lola on the regular.

I am hoping my work takes me to Cleveland again so I can continue to explore Lola's menu."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: my boyfriend cooks at Lola.  
That said, this is a restaurant that visitors to Cleveland really should not miss.  The food, ambience, and service are simply outstanding.
The pierogis are a perrenial favorite, and if you are lucky enough to eat there when the sweetbreads are on the menu, you are lucky indeed.
One word to the wise: if you would like to go on a weekend evening, plan ahead and make a reservation."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful post-Cavs game dinner here last night. The atmosphere and service were both fantastic. We split a few cocktails, a salad, an order of sprouts and the flank steak and loved everything. Very nice date spot near the stadiums."}
{"text":"Of course beingMichael Simon's flagship restaurant many of the menu choices were pretty adventurous.  We had the Beef Cheek Perogies, Pork Frito Misto, Beef Hangar Steak, and the Calf Heart.  Apart from the steak everything was new to me.  

The standouts were definitely the Beef Cheek Pierogies and  the Calf Heart.  The beef cheek was wonderfully tender and delicious.  The Heart was cooked medium rare and then sliced EXTREMELY thinly to make it super tender.  The flavors were excellent in this dish.

The Pork Frito Misto was a little disappointing.  I expected lots of crisp and tons of flavor but it just didn't impress me.  I liked the pork belly part but the rest didn't seem to be well seasoned?  Oh well.

The hangar steak was quite good.  This is one of the best cuts of meat you can find.  Nearly as tender as a filet but equally flavorful to your rib-eye.

I will be back when in Cleveland to try some of Chef Simon's other delicacies!"}
{"text":"Went here last night, for our 25th wedding anniversary dinner.  My wife's scallops were very good and properly cooked. The ceviche appetizer she had was also quite good. My crispy bone marrow appetizer ($24!) was very good and different! My entrée was a little disappointing though. I had the duck. It was a little undercooked for medium rare and it was tough. It was sliced inconsistently too. The thin slices were tender and the thick were chewy. For the price, it was not the best duck I've had. The apple crisp dessert was small but good, not over the top though. Overall the experience was underwhelming. The \"extra\" they provided to celebrate our 25th anniversary was a birthday candle in the apple crisp.

Also, when we arrived we asked if Michael Symon was there and were told he was! What a nice surprise. We asked, a few times, if he would come to say hello, after all it was our anniversary! We were finally told he'd left! I'm not a celebrity hound nor do I care about autographs, but, I thought it would have been nice if he'd taken a few minutes to say hello. After all, the dinner and three drinks came to $192 with tip!

In my opinion, not worth the price. Maybe his Lolita restaurant is better. It's disappointing that once some people achieve a level of fame, they forget where they came from, and the way to make a positive impression on customers."}
{"text":"ate there twice on a recent visit to cleveland.  loved it.   beef pierogies  were possibly the greatest thing I have ever eaten.  for main course had some great pork chops.  awesome sauces on all apps.  decent beers to choose from.  

one complaint is that you cannot order entrees from patio, just small plates.  makes no sense, as they were the best seats on a nice night.  but, then again, you just order small plates and get some bread (very good whipped butter, too) and you are doing great.

probably wont be a few years till i go back to cleveland, but this will definitely be my first stop."}
{"text":"The second I knew we were headed to the land of cleves, I made a reservation at Lola. 

The restaurant was lovely. Cream colored leather chairs with black piping, white tablecloths, industrial cement columns and a lighted coffered ceiling. A nice mix of trends and class.

Our experience was next to perfect. First, we are seated and there, inches away, expediting in the open kitchen, is Michael Simon. What a nice surprise! You don't actually see celebrity chefs manning their flagship  restaurants in my town (Vegas).  

My sister and I started with a fiore limone, a specialty martini with lemon, St. Germaine, and vodka. My mother and hubby opted for a glass of red. Each of our beverages were selected off of an iPad. Strange. Are you changing your wine list daily??? Why the digital format??  The martini was extra chilled and delicious. 

The bread service was flawless. A warm sourdough sliced with a nicely salted whipped butter. More was served without even a request. 

We started with beef cheek perrogies and fried chicken livers. The livers were crusted in cornmeal and served with a plum jam and fresh salad garnish. They were tasty. They were overshadowed by the superb perrogies. They were filled with braised, shredded beef cheek and topped with a beefy jus and horseradish cream. They were so decadent and beefy. The demiglace coated your palate with beefy goodness, the slightly gummy perrogie dough satisfied and the horseradish cream added just the right hint of flavor. Did I mentioned the beefyness?

My sister and I order scallops with a side of roasted fingerling potatoes with caramelized onions, while hubs had hanger steak and mamma had pasta with morels and ramps. The scallops were dreamy. Seared crispy on the outside and served with spring peas, and fresh carrot garnish. Hubs hanger steak melted like butter in your mouth and was served with a large portion of perfectly seasoned crispy fries.  Everything was seasoned to perfection, flavorful, and lovely. 

We ended the meal with a nice coffee. Robust and hot. 

The damage was $66 each including tip. The experience exceeded my expectations and left me feeling pleased with Lola!"}
{"text":"Very easy place to to rate:   *****

Food, service, ambiance makes for an exceptional experience, which is what food should be about. To get into a lot of detail is unnecessary but I will say that the sturgeon was exceptionally exceptional. 

Love the building restoration and it's use.

It is so encouraging to see Cleveland exciting alive and glowing as it is. I say this as a former Cincinnati and current Miami resident. And Labron has yet to make his appearance. 

We will be back next year to enjoy Lola's, the Cavs and the city. 

Many thanks."}
{"text":"Ok I would give it 4 1/2 if I could. Took a little weekend trip with my mama. Partly to see the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (review to follow) and partly to go to Lola. I had been to Lolita a few years back and was a big fan. Lola did not disappoint! A really lovely space, sleek but not too, dark but not too, bustling but not too...noisy. Our service was lovely (Gina) and she really took her time with us but wasn't too intrusive. 

The cocktail list is quite pretty, I had a fig martini with a little bubbly floater. It tasted like the best ever kir royale. We had a caramelized cauliflower soup, so creamy. The sweetbreads had the most light dusting of something magical and were perfectly crisp on the outside and creamy on the inside. The oysters were worth every penny. My mom had the walleye \"Cleveland Clambake\" that was adorably presented, and the nicest piece of fish. I had the duck breast that was rich and perfect and too much to finish. 

Losing a half star for the dessert. We had the pear baked alaska, and it was perfectly pretty on the plate. But it was honestly a tad boring after such a scrumptious meal. I should have gone with my gut and got the famous 6a.m. special, but next time perhaps... 

Regardless of the dessert, it was a really wonderful meal, a nice staff, a pretty space, and come on, it's Cleveland."}
{"text":"Ate here for anniversary dinner with my husband.  
Very dark walls and everything inside is dark and gloomy.  Fake candles on each table.  So cheesy! 
The pierogi appetizer was delicious!
My husband had the strip steak.  Boring dish.  So much black pepper that it was hard to taste the meat.  I would not recommend.
I had the pork chop.  There was so much fat on the meat that it was disgusting and hard to eat.  For $40 an entree you'd think they could trim the fat off the meat.  I'm normally not picky about this but it was excessive and disgusting!!!  I would not recommend! 

Service was poor.  Our waiter had no personality and appeared to hate his job.  Gave us no explanation of the entrees even when we asked.  

We will not be back.  Waste of money!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, it gets a whole star on its own. And the complimentary macaroons got a star as well. The service was decent, the food was alright. I ordered the Walleye. Two slabs of Walleye with Bacon, potatoes, and clams in a shellfish broth. The Walleye was a little heavy and fishy for my taste, but that could just be the fish. The beef perogies were good, although the sourcream had a pretty strong horseradish flavor and I am not a fan of that at all, but to each their own. My group ordered three desserts, I ordered the Lemon Lavender. I have no idea what was going on on that plate. A huge combination of bland lavender and extreme tangy zest that I couldn't get to blend. The Bacon ice cream was fun and interesting, but the Bacon was very overwhelming. And my boyfriend ordered the chocolate mousse which was very good. I also sampled the porkchops and the salmon, both were alright but nothing extraordinary and not really worth the price. But it was an enjoyable experience none-the-less."}
{"text":"I have had just two experiences at Lola.  One was 5-star worthy, and the other was 3.  

The first time, I went with a large group, and everything was fabulous.  Our friendly and helpful waiter recommended a wine based on my tastes, and it was a smashing hit (so good, I don't remember what it was).  Our food was all perfectly prepared and oustanding.  We loved the 5 AM special (or 6 AM, whatever it is).  

The vibe was outstanding.  We arrived early so that we could have a couple of cocktails to start, and if you don't do this, you miss one of the better parts of Lola, the super sexy bar.  The elevated glass-enclosed wine room, the glowing marble bar top, and the attentive and attractive bar staff all make for a lovely cocktail experience.  There was an energy to the place that was undeniable, and that made a great meal outstanding.

On my second visit with my wife, this time just the two of us, we had a very \"A-OK\" meal.  We did go during the \"dining out in Cleveland\" experience, but we ordered full-priced meals off the regular menu and expected a full-priced experience.  What we got was the \"dining out in Cleveland\" reduced-price prix fixe experience, and it was certainly not up to the level of Michael Symon's reputation.  Our server was distracted and slow, and our food was merely decent.  I got the ribeye with salsa verde and a side of bone marrow and something else, and everything just tasted like fat.  Really wonderful, velvety smooth, richly flavorful fat, but that's all I got out of it.  The ribeye didn't need the help of the bone marrow.  My wife got the hanger steak with pickle sauce, and said the pickle sauce was overwhelming and had to be scraped off.  She's a pickle lover, too.

Our experience wasn't bad at all... it just was nowhere near what we expected based on our first visit.  

We'll be back, and if it's another 4+ star evening, I'll chalk the bad night up to them being busy serving a bunch of people that wouldn't go without the cheap dining experience.  That's not meant to sound snobby - check my other reviews.  It's just the truth - the front and back of the house both have to be able to focus on a certain type of clientele, and if they are distracted by a special event or evening, it sometimes shows."}
{"text":"My dining experience was made by our waiter, Ryan. We had pretty late reservations at 8:30, so as we ate our meal the restaurant was thinning out. So our waiter was able to take the time to talk to our table. He recommended things to do, see, and eat in Cleveland since we are from out of town. He was really friendly. I had the hanger steak and asparagus, both were really good. The 6am special tasted like bacon which is kind of weird for a dessert. It's interesting, but may not be for everyone."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! The deep fried bone marrow appetizer and calves heart entree?? My goodness. Very unique, full flavors, rich, delicious. I mean, straight-up bone marrow's great and all, but deep-fried, with bacon jam, blue cheese drizzle, a squeeze of fresh lemon, sea salt, parsley, and thinly-sliced pickled onions? Mind-blowing. My taste-buds didn't know what to do with themselves. The calves heart dish was surprisingly tender, cooked well, and decently portioned. My friend got a duck dish, which I don't think is still on the menu. That one was alright. Nothing exciting, a little overpriced for the few pieces of duck. Overall, an excellent, top tier dining experience for non-outrageous, Cleveland real estate prices. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Just writing this and thinking of how good my meal was makes me want to eat there again and again.  One of my favorite things about life is the Beef Hanger Steak in pickle sauce, chiles and lola fries."}
{"text":"Michael Symon's restaurant activity in Cleveland is now vast, but Lola is the jewel in the crown. Perfect author cuisine, with plenty of imagination, but also very well directed on more common foods. Service is outstanding. A must in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"I would be lying if I said that I haven't day-dreamt about the beef cheek peirogi's every day since one met my lips two months ago during my Cleveland visit. Everything we had was divine, even the Reuben! Wonderful service. Wish I had tried the mac, but will definitely pay another visit. Hanger steak was delicious. Yum."}
{"text":"I ate here this past weekend with a dining companion on a Saturday Night.  We had reservations and were immediately seated at our table right after entering the restaurant.  Whenever the server came over for the first time, he brought an Ipad with him that he left on the table since it was filled with their drinks menu.  It was a novel idea that I enjoyed even if the application itself seemed a bit clunky.  I figured if there were giving me an Ipad, then I would be able to order the drinks myself. Unfortunately that was not the case and I ended up showing the server  our \"shopping cart\" whenever he came back.  It did eliminate having to pronounce some items though and provided a nice way to group and show people the list.

After having read many reviews on here we started off dinner by splitting both the beef cheek pierogeis and pork bellies.  The pierogies came out pre-split which was convenient for us and tasted wonderfully.  The meat was moist and tender while the creme fraiche helped to enhance the flavor.  The pork bellies also had a nice flavor with some of the fried pieces tasting very much like chicken wings which I loved.  For dinner I decided upon the pork chop with a side of broccoli rabe to split with my dining companion who decided on the duck.  Both dishes were out of this world with everything having great flavors and being perfectly cooked.  The broccoli rabe was also good with a nice lemony flavor.  For dessert I was very interested in trying the 6 AM special to get at the Maple Bacon Ice Cream but thought that the Strawberry Panna Cotta also sounded good.  Whenever I asked the server if I could get the Panna Cotta which a side of the ice cream, he informed me that he could get that for me but the ice cream would not be nearly as good by itself as it would with the other flavors.  Since we had been between those two desserts anyways, he ended up swaying us to the 6 AM special and what a good choice it was.  The ice cream ended up having huge chucks of bacon in it and the flavors all played wonderfully together.

The bottom line for me is that I would have definitely head back here in the future if I was in Cleveland again.  The service was wonderful as was the food and I do not have a single bad thing to say about this place."}
{"text":"OK, another 5-star. I know it looks like I'm getting soft but this place was truly amazing. Eight friends on a Saturday night was no problem with day before reservations. Different tastes, different backgrounds, some seriously picky eaters to be sure -- all were impressed. 

We all shared a bite or two of 5-6 appetizers. I wanted to lick the little empty plates they were all so good. 

The wife and I split the Dover sole ($65), de-boned at table side (like the scene from the Julia on Julia movie). It was cooked perfectly and plenty for two to share. After about about half way into it I saw the cut grapes on the side of the dish and scooped one up with a bit of fish...WOW! The flavor was unbelievable; unlike anything I've ever tasted. I told my wife to do the same and she too was blown away. 

Rookie mistake! I've eaten at enough good places to know better. Jeez!

Step one: Look at the pretty dish -- take a picture if you must;
Step two: Make a mess out of it and let the ingredients compliment each other;
Step three: Take a bit of everything in one bite and hold on as the flavor profile sends your taste buds into orbit!

Yeah, it was that good. All agreed.

I had a bite or two of the steaks at the table. Again, blown away. I rarely order steaks because I usually make em better. After this, I'm not sure I know how to cook a steak...

We shared one of each of the desserts; like the appetizers, all were delicious. And yes, the cocktails and wine selection were very nice indeed. The ambiance was comfortable and the staff were flawless. 

All in all, everyone loved it. Frankly, it may have been the best tasting complete meal I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"A super solid 4.25 stars. Everything is great here from the seasonal menu to the friendly and attentive service to the extensive wine list and the environment/decor. This was my second time here and this is a place I'll drop by whenever I'm in Cleveland. First time I had the pierogis and scallops. The pierogies were meaty and creamy and the bay scallops were tasty but small so they kind of got lost amidst of the other components of the dish. This time I had the cruciferious raw salad, smoked pork chops, and Brussels sprouts. My dad used to put blueberry yogurt on his salad at home and we the kids thought it was absolutely disgusting. However I think he may be on to something...the cruciferous salad was tossed in a curried yogurt mix which was thick and creamy yet refreshing which was really interesting. It was plated in a swirly pattern that would also look like random pile of stuff depending on the angle, which reminded me of something Escher would be into. The pork chops were delicious. They were tender and the fat had a caramel like flavor that was super unique. The scallions on top gave the dish to a nice bit of freshness that contrasted nicely with the creamy polenta and the rich bbq'd onions. The Brussels sprouts were unique also. There was practically no browning at all so the flavor of the Brussels sprouts themselves came through a bit more which was accentuated by the butter, lemon, and Parmesan. All in all really good and I'll definitely be back to see how the menu changes. :)"}
{"text":"We made a road trip here in order to eat at Michael Symon's restaurant! Boy, were we in for a treat!
We were interested in the tasting menu but only realized when we got there that we had to pre-order it. The slight disappointment was soon swept away when we came up with the brilliant idea to make our own tasting menu (this probably skewed our check a little).
We started with a soup of the day which was delicious. I can't remember what it was but it had some tasty lobster pieces in it. Then came their signature appetizer, the beef cheek perogie. This is a must-try!
The rest of our custom tasting menu was fabulous but the highlights were: perfectly seared and seasoned scallops, the rosemary-infused fries (Lola fries), and the dessert of the day - zucchini cake. 
You can specially reserve this \"table\" which overlooks the kitchen. It is more akin to a sushi bar and you can watch the chefs at work in the open kitchen. Even though we didn't get to sit there for our entire meal, our waitress did let us have the spot for dessert.
What an amazing experience! The food was delicious and the atmosphere was casual and friendly. If I'm ever back in town, I'm definitely coming here again!"}
{"text":"The service was good and the food was out of this world, concluding with a dessert of brioche French toast and maple-bacon ice-cream.  The pork-three-ways appetizer was also notably awesome (that particular one doesn't seem to be on their current menu, but there are similar options).

In Cleveland?  Love food?  Have some extra cash?  Go here."}
{"text":"So this restaurant belongs to one of my wife favorite IronChef's so we decided to give it a try. Started with the roasted cauliflower and it was very good . I love the pickle onions on it.  Then moved to the main course which she had the lamb shank and I the Hanger Steak.  She said this so far was the best Lamb she's had because it did t taste gamie.  My hanger was cooked perfectly but I though it lacked a little more intense flavor. Though the steak came with toppings, I always feel that the meat should have its own domain if I decided to only eat that .  Finally we ended the evening with a toffee pudding desert. Which was good.  The atmosphere of the restaurant and service is great. The food for being an IronChef was good. Which I personally expect to blown away.  Yes I will be back to try either the ribeye or lobster Thermador which looked great.  So Michael. You have gained my business but it's up to you to keep it    Call me if you need advise from an Ironman"}
{"text":"Fantastic meal all around. The service was excellent, every restaurant around should take a page out of their book. The food was exceptional, my husband and I had 3 courses and everything was impeccable!"}
{"text":"From \"The Chew\" & \"Iron Chef\", Chef Michael Symon's Lola is amazing. Pricey but very much worth every dollar. It's the kind of place that gives you that \"stuffy, ritzy feeling\" without all the \"stuffy\". I have been here a multitude of times; however, I've never reviewed. I finally branched out with my appetizer this time & tried the much raved \"Bone Marrow\". It was delicious. I have tried almost every entree, so I switched it up tonight & got the Strip Loin. It's an upgraded version of the hangar steak & it did not disappoint! Continually pleased with this place, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very cool spot!  Awesome front corner booth with great view of the bar and the street.  Love the urban/rustic/modern chic decor.  Foie gras appetizer, I had the duck, both were superb!  I tried our servers recommendation for a European cider that was great.  She was attentive and very helpful with suggestions.  We both agreed that the bar scene looked fantastic and we wished we had time to stay for another drink.  4th a Street was hopping with St. Patty's Day partiers!"}
{"text":"Oh Lola, how I love thee.  I was quite surprised that on a Saturday at 7pm it wasn't packed.  I suppose it is Cleveland, which isn't exactly known for being a fine dining mecca (this place would make a killing in Chicago or NYC), but still.  It's situated on a block full of bars and outdoor seating.  All of the other places were lively but Lola was only about 2/3 full.  Either way, more for me!  I love the decor.  The bar has a wine cellar behind it that is clear so you can see the servers going in to get bottles of wine when they're ordered.  It's pretty similar to Gordon Ramsay's Petrus...pretty cool!  The sommelier was very friendly.  We sort of knew what we wanted, but he was helpful either way.  The service was absolutely outstanding as well.  And the bill was less than I expected.  Totally worth the 5 hour drive to go there (yes, I did).

Onto the food.  For a starter we did the beef cheek pierogi.  O-M-G.  The beef was super tender but the star was actually the pierogi itself.  It was amazing!  And I grew up on the NW side of Chicago where we have the second highest concentration of Polish people outside Warsaw (literally, not even other places in Poland have more densely populated Poles) so I consider myself a good judge of pierogis.  Highly recommend.  For entrees my husband got the pork chop, which he thought was the best pork chop ever.  I was more impressed with my lamb.  It comes with a cucumber sauce that is almost like a sexy tzatziki sauce.  It was so yum!  The lamb was a perfect medium rare and so good I was gnawing on the bones afterward (I know, classy).  But seriously folks, go get this lamb."}
{"text":"When in Cleveland..... 

Eat at Lola. Yup, just like everyone else I went there because I saw it was Iron Chef Michael Symon's restaurant and it was totally worth it! I love going to hip restaurants, but hate that they usually think tiny portions are what impresses all of us wannabe foodies. This was real, good food. 

Here is the dish on the dishes we had: 
Apps: 
1. Crispy Veal Sweetbreads - served with leeks blue cheese and mushrooms. --Awesome! 
2. Cured Tuna - saffron aoli, fennel and olives -- Awesome! 

Entrees (all generous portions)- 
1. Hanger Steak w/ pickle demi - I don't like pickles, but was convinced to order this and it was amazing. It was a little odd to serve it with french fries in his signature chrome martini shaker. 
2. Chilean Sea bass - nothin fishy about this one. It was cooked perfectly and a little flaky 
3. Beef Cheeks -- poblano pepper glaze from heaven on top! 

Don't ask, just order the 6 A.M Special for desert. It is ridiculous and delicious. Arguably the best desert I've ever had. 

There were a few comments about parking, but there is public garage 2 blocks away on 4th - compared the the San Francisco Bay Area this was valet. This place is hip and lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"I feel bad giving a two star review, but I was disappointed after hearing such great things about Lola. While our waiter was fantastic, and very knowledgeable, I wasn't impressed at all with the meal. While my meal was just okay (a bit bland and the vegetables were super salty), my companion's meal was boring and unmemorable. I was a little bummed out that I can get a better meal at the Winking Lizard for a 1/3 of the price."}
{"text":"Pretty amazing dinner experience.

The bread service was wicked good.

The pierogi was OK. The Ceviche was so/so.

The ribeye steak was epic.

The lemon lavender desert was very tasty.

The service was top notch and there was no waiting to be seated, even on this busy night."}
{"text":"I've wanted to go to this restaurant for a while, ever since going to its sister restaurant, Lolita. Lola is significantly more pretentious and lacking in parking.  It's tucked in a little street, so a little walking will likely be necessary. Service was... interesting. Not bad.  Just a little off. It could have been because I was eating alone and wearing jeans, so if that's your thing, as it is mine, prepare for vague discomfort.  

The food itself is worth the vaguely off-putting service.  I had the salmon, which they somehow managed to make crispy, while still being moist and tender.  Consider my mind blown.  Like... it was delicious.  I'm still thinking about it and can't figure it out.  The soup was also unexpected and delicious. It was a seasonal corn and lobster concoction and was the perfect blend  of crunchy and smooth and sweet and salty. Sigh. Delicious. The potato side dish, however. Just potatoes.  Worthy of skipping. Unlike dessert. Which should not be skipped. 
Solid 4.5, though again, may be improved by conforming to what they think you should be."}
{"text":"Excellent food, the wait staff was prompt with refills. The butter is amazing, and the entree was perfect size for lunch. I had the trout, and the skin was amazingly crispy and the fish cooked perfectly through."}
{"text":"Was in Cleveland on business and Yelp reviews brought me in. Great food, attentive service, and nice atmosphere.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We went to Lola and we were not disappointed. We try to stop at a well known chef (not always main stream) restaurant in each city we visit. The presentation was very simplistic, which was very refreshing. The smell was impeccable and the taste of everything we had was amazing and full of flavor, there was no need for condiments here! Would dine again if ever back in Cleveland"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Cleveland. Great atmosphere, excellent food, and perfectly paired wines."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal here for our 20th anniversary dinner.  We each had a cocktail which were quite nice.  For an appetizer we started with the Sunchokes.  I've never had sunchokes before and they were delicious.  For an entree I had the scallops without bacon and the husband had the hangar steak.  The scallops were among the best I've ever had and I was surprised they were normally made with bacon.  They were light and citrusy and perfect and it seems like the addition of bacon would weigh them down.  He raved about his hangar steak.  The service was attentive and unobtrusive.  The wines we both had with our meal were great as well.  For dessert we had the Lola S'more which was outstanding.  We were very pleased and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Genius flavor combinations! I had delicious scallops and every bite is like a surprise party in your mouth. I also had the peanut butter pretzel dessert, which was also amazing - the prices are totally worth the quality of your meal. The atmosphere is gorgeous, too; however, it's a bit difficult to hear/converse with whoever you're with because it's pretty loud."}
{"text":"Finally finally made it here for dinner! I had a table of 4... I had the special soup of the day - butternut squash and smoked tomato. They were very accommodating and left out the creme fresh for me. And for dinner I had the halibut with the saffron sauce. I really could have licked the plate to get every last drop of the saffron sauce. The dish was overall really tasty, but a little too salty. The top of the fish was crispy which was nice. 

The staff was very attentive, constantly clearing the table and filling waters. Overall it was a really nice experience."}
{"text":"Just dont get the lamb. Either it was off that night or there are just better things on the menu. Would be 5 stars otherwise but I panicked and got the lamb. Everything else was PERFECT!!! Stupid lamb."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the taste and food's quality. Salmon was prepare perfectly, not sure puree of fava beans and mint is the best choice to accompany the salmon.

Bread was fresh and delicious.
Service was on the slow side."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Once I had the tasting menu and the other I ordered a la carte. Both times the food was excellent.

As a sweets junkie, I must put in a good word for the incredible desserts I've had!!

The \"6am special\" is very cute- french toast with maple bacon ice cream and caramelized apple (looks like hashbrown). Warning- there is ACTUAL bacon bits in the ice cream!!!! If you dig that, this is for you!!

The \"warm stone foot crisp\" is not really a fruit crisp but more of a peach cobbler, topped with honey lavender ice cream. I LOVE lavender ice cream, and though there's only a hint of the flavor in this one, it's worth it.

The \"Amedi dark chocolate chiffon\"- all I can say is proceed with caution!! This dessert is very bold due to the balsamic reduction. It's almost like soy sauce with chocolate. The flavor works miraculously, but it's not something a kid would enjoy.

I hope to try the rest of the desserts and put in my two cents later!"}
{"text":"It was delicious and I look forward to returning here in the near future! I live in Nashville but it'll be on the agenda the next time I'm in the area. I ate here for lunch with my boyfriend a few months ago. Even though it was lunch we ate a full 3 course meal just because it's Michael Symon's restaurant. It's a must go if you haven't eaten here!"}
{"text":"The iron chef's place does not fail to disappoint.  

I am only going to write about the two appetizers that my party of 4 shared.

Braised Beef Cheek Pierogi- Very tasty and very well presented.

Braised Berkshire Bacon- Out of this world.  This dish literally melts in your mouth as it sends you to culinary bliss. 

Both dishes are enough for me to return. 

Note: In my opinion this place is leagues above its sister restaurant, Lolita.  Save the cash by just going here twice."}
{"text":"We had a bad server. My salad came with no dressing and, yes, the manager came over to check on us but no apologies. I had the Hanger Steak. (Skirt steak) Unless you like seafood or lamb, you get a Ribeye or Hanger (skirt steak) steak. Oh, and french  fries came with it. No special sauce. No special seasonings. I could have prepared better meal if I was at home. With such an easy selection and a slow night, I expected better. Not returning. Houston and New York still have best food."}
{"text":"PROS: excellent food (creative, well-harmonized, delicately blended flavors), satisfactory portions, decent craft beer selection, extensive wine menu (on an iPad), excellent service, easy reservations available via OpenTable, fairly reasonable pricing for an upscale joint

CONS: large groups (mostly older professionals, notably in finance) tend to gravitate towards Lola so it can get pretty loud --make sure you're seated away from the large groups if you're hoping for a more intimate meal

---
Lola's everything an upscale restaurant should be.

Came with the bf for our one year anniversary dinner.  We rarely go the fancy dining route--in fact, this was our very first --so we were bracing ourselves to have our wallets brutally plundered. Happily, we skirted that fate.  We ended up paying $70 apiece including tip (yeah we're egalitarian like that), and we'd ordered quite a lot: two appetizers, two entrees, two drinks, and a dessert to share.

We turned to our fellow Yelpers for menu suggestions and (of course) we were not disappointed (you all rock!).  

Libations: Lindemans Lambic Framboise and Lambic Pomme
Appetizers: beef cheek pierogies, crispy bone marrow 
Entrees:  venison steak medallions for the boy, sturgeon on top of scallops for me
Dessert: The 6a.m. Special (maple-bacon ice cream on french toast, drizzled with caramel)

I'm no gourmet/fine dining expert, but every dish we had stood out for me in its exceptional, delicate blending of flavors.  The pierogies were succulent but not overly greasy--there were only two per order but with everything else we had, it was just the right portion for an appetizer.  Reminded me of Chinese wontons.  The crispy bone marrow was pure indulgence--basically fried fat and an array of relishes and spices in miniscule cups to spread over toasted bread, brought out on an rustically elegant wooden board.  I was happy with my sturgeon--it wasn't mind-blowing but quite pleasantly combined with the scallops and blended, creamy mixture of sauces.  The bf loved the venison--not my favorite meat, but it was appropriately lightly seared and mostly rare.    The 6a.m. Special left a delicious taste in our mouths by the end of the meal.  Honestly, I've had better bacon ice cream (Coolhaus, please station a truck in Cleveland!), but the combination of the bacon ice cream (which by the way, is CHOCK full of bacon bits) with the french toast and caramel was so pleasingly balanced, I almost felt it was a nutritionally well-rounded meal in itself.  Almost.

We went right after work, and by the time our appetizers arrived, a large party had filled up a long row of tables next to us and grew very loud over the course of the evening.  Aside from that though, our dinner was perfect.  Our waiter was extremely professional and courteous.  We were impressed by his graceful crumb-sweeping skills, executed with what looked like a pocket-shovel-dustpan.  We were able to make reservations online, and were seated immediately even when we showed up a little earlier.  The ambiance was upscale, yet there were plenty of more casually-dressed diners and what looked like young professionals dropping in for a drink and dessert.  

Upscale yet relaxed, offering excellent fare crafted with creative finesse, Lola left us feeling warm and cozy inside.  We'll definitely be back when the mood for romance or beef cheek pierogies--whichever comes first--strikes us."}
{"text":"My BF and I finally took the off the beaten path vacation to Cleveland and Sandusky, OH for Memorial Day weekend, and you know Lola had to be our first dinner stop.  We were seated immediately for our 7:45pm dinner reservation and were thrilled to see Michael Symon at work!  That was a treat!  The atmosphere was very dark, but elegant and classy...perfect for date night.

We started with the chilled lobster salad, which was absolutely delicious...they were very accommodating and split all of our appetizers into 2 plates.  The terragon puree with the grapefruit was such a great compliment to the perfectly booked lobster.  We followed that up with the pork belly...which was perfectly seared on one side with a little crunch and melt in your mouth goodness on the bottom side.  It came with buffalo pig ear, which was thinly sliced pig ear fried and finished with buffalo wing sauce...with a side of sliced celery and blue cheese.  Perfect combo.  We couldn't stop there...had to try the beef cheek pierogi.  Very tender and great mushroom sauce.

For our entrees, my BF had the grilled lamb heart, which he described as gyro on steroids...lol.  Very thinly sliced lamb heart was on a bed of peas, carrots, etc.  He seemed to have enjoyed it quite a bit.  I had the beef hanger steak...OMG...the most tender piece of hanger steak ever.  Perfectly marinated and topped with salsa verde, which was kind of like chimichurri with a side of lola fries, which were absolutely the best fries ever.

We couldn't stop there, so we shared 3 desserts between us.  I think our waiter, Steve, chuckled at the fact that we couldn't decide and decided on all three.  But Steve was really friendly and accommodating...even gave us a list of places we should hit while in Cleveland.  Very nice touch.  Anyways...back to the desserts.  We started with Lemon Lavender, which was kind of like a lemon mousse on top of a thin cake with a side of lemon sherbert.  Very light and palette cleansing.  Then we had the strawberry panna cotta, which had the most delicious macerated berries on top.  We finished our food marathon with the 6AM Special....brioche french toast with maple bacon ice cream!!  We were in culinary heaven!!

I don't think I'll be back in Cleveland anytime soon, but if I ever go back, I'm totally going to Lola again for the fantastic experience and wonderful food."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Cleveland I've been dying to eat here. Finally got the chance.

The ambience can't be beat but the menu leaves a little to be desired. IT' not very extensive and nothing really jumped out from the menu at me as something tantalizing.
THe food that I ordered was fine, but not nearly as amazing as the room would lead you to believe.
There's a bar there, and I personally think that it's a much better place to go have a drink than it is to eat. 
The view from the restaurant is great and since I was there on HAlloween night, the people watching was Boo-tiful, sadly though, I preferred looking out the window to looking at my plate."}
{"text":"I get the hype but considering all Cleveland has to offer Lola is boring after the first time or two you go there it has no thrill. There is little reason to continue back. I had the steak frits it was really good but other places in Cleveland do better. Almost everything on the menu that sounds spectacular can be purchased at other Cleveland locations for lower price with more taste."}
{"text":"Reservations we made was spot on and on time. Everyone was friendly and helpful. As to my meal.  I had a ribeye. Tender and right amount of trimmed fat but the taste. It will be very hard for other Steak houses to top over this yummy ribeye. My total meal was wonderful well worth the visit. Scale 1 / 10 I give 20."}
{"text":"We ordered the gnocchi as an app and they spilt in half for us...we wanted a half order which they agreed to do however, they served and charged us for a full order. It was good, very light. For entrées we ordered the hanger steak and the pork chop. The steak was wonderful, but be aware that their \"medium\" is more like\"medium rare\". The pork chop was a disappointment. It was tender enough, but just lacked flavor and we did not eat it. For dessert we ordered the 6:00 am special and the Chocolate peanut butter crunch and both were fantastic. Overall a good meal but the pork chop was a no-go and frankly so was the full size/price pasta order when they agreed to a half order app size."}
{"text":"I have a huge fan of Michael Symon so my wife took me here for a date night. I was not as happy as I hoped I would be. Over all, the experience was wonderful. The staff and the atmosphere were first class. The appetizer I got, the beef cheek perogies, were out of this world good. But for the main course I got leg of lamb which while good was overwhelmed with the cucumber sauce they put on it. For dessert however, we got a few things and they were above average. I understand that Iron Chef Symon was not cooking when we were there so my expectations were a little too high probably. Over all - lovely place to eat"}
{"text":"Wonderful place.  Ordered bean soup,  sturgeon and some merengue desert and all of it was fantastic. Have a gluten allergy.  Menu was clearly marked and the waiter was supper helpful. Awesome place."}
{"text":"The food and menu were everything you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber, but the noise just ruins the whole experience. I don't feel like I can really enjoy my food in the midst of the sonic assault of hearing what every other person in the entire restaurant is saying. I actually wanted to go over to at least two other tables and ask people to shut up. I went with a group of four and it felt like we were yelling the entire time. A little attention to acoustics could do wonders to improve this restaurant.  

Others have probably said everything there is to say about the food, but I'll add a couple of quick notes. We had bone marrow and the pork stomach as appetizers. The bone marrow was a little on the greasy side and tasted much better with plain bread than with the toast they served it on. The toast actually masks the rather delicate flavor of the marrow. When eaten with the plain bread, the flavors really opened up. The pork stomach was just delicious.

I had the Hawaiian and I really enjoyed the unique and aromatic flavor they gave to the dish. They used very delicate and fresh coriander seeds that really complemented the greens. I was very impressed with the dish. I think everyone enjoyed their dishes. Rachel had the venison, which she really enjoyed. 

Despite the quality of the food, we all agreed that we would not return to Lola. The noise was just too much. It's a shame."}
{"text":"The atmosphere, service, and creativity of the menu are all great. I loved the beef cheek pierogis that my boyfriend and I shared. My cocktail (Gin-ger flower) had ginger beer in it and was incredible, and the quail and pork belly was good, though slightly too salty. However, the sides are nothing special, and the pasta my boyfriend had was good, but something he could have done at home. Not worth $20 in other words. Overall we enjoyed Lola though. I'd eat here again for sure."}
{"text":"I mean, what more is there to say about Lola?  It's one of those really fancy places that you take visitors to Cleveland to... if you know that they will be paying.  I tend to prefer Lolita, which is smaller, more down to earth, easier to make reservations for, less expensive, and has that same Michael Symon quality.  

The beef cheek appetizer is always on the menu at Lola, and it is superb."}
{"text":"This place is nice and cozy!   Made me mad that I called 2 weeks in advance and they told me its first come first serve for tables, then we show up at 5pm reservation at 5:15, and the place is empty and I told hostess that I talked to her co- worker and told her by name to give us an anniversary seat, and they said, or she said those booths are reserved, I said I called ahead, then she says, oh we do our best, well I'm first, so tell the next person I there is no reservations on tables or you will do your best, not oh well our big spenders get those, tell them we did our best, mister I'm a clevelander Lola, owner! Hey Michael you grew up in Cleveland, I almost really went Cleveland in your lets make New York in the \"plum\"! That is so unprofessional!  I was here willing to pay! And it's my anniversary! So damn this place gets 4 stars! Now!  Khool place but we are in a corner! Couldn't! Pick my table!  Oh we will do our best for \"our friends\"  I want to speak like a truck driver to everyone but my mediator/ waitress, she calmed me! Will post food later maybe."}
{"text":"I'm torn about this place.  First off, the food was fantastic.  Both mine and my girlfriends dishes were so delicious and tasty, there's no doubt that Lola deserves 5 stars for the food.  

My issue is with the atmosphere, layout, and comfort.  Lola is easy enough to find right on East 4th, right in the middle of all the other bars and restaurants.  Right when you walk in its a congested entryway with not enough room leading into a large open space where you're greeted by the hostess.  Finding my reservation (made easily on opentable) was quick and I was shortly escorted to our table.  From the hostess, you walk through a large open space with the bar to the left, towards that rear where all the tables are packed together.  Slightly odd layout given how open the restaurant space is and how close all of here tables felt in the back.  We sat down and immediately my girlfriend complained that her chair was very uncomfortable.  Mine felt fine, so we switched and sure enough it felt like her chair bottom just sunk in, as if there was no cushion under your bottom.  I asked one of the staff about replacing the chair, which he did without a problem, taking it downstairs and coming back with a new one.  I tried the new one out and same problem.  Weird.  I sucked it up and switched seats and sat on it the entire night because no one returned to follow up and ask if it was any more comfortable.  

Overall I felt her to service was mediocre with little attention paid to our table.  Not what I'd expect for the level of restaurant Lola markets itself.  Walking out of the restaurant I glanced over to the bar and there were several men with sleeveless tshirts having drinks.  Really cleveland?  Maybe it's less of a reflection of Lola, versus the people in cleveland.  It's a nice restaurant with moderate to high priced food.  While the food certainly lived up to the hype, the service and attention to detail here was severely lacking."}
{"text":"We love Lola...what can I say? It's the place we take the in-laws for any special occasion and it was their Christmas treat this year. The food was great as ever. You can't go wrong with the pierogies, though the mushroom terrine was just so so. I barely made a debt in my pork shank, and we all shared it with breakfast the next day. The banana cake dessert was to die for. Nice touch: we had a delay bring seated (they forgot to check us in) but they bought us a round of drinks to make up for it AND brought us a glass of rose the bar has accidentally poured. Lovely to the end as always!"}
{"text":"Lola is a very good restaurant.  If I were eating out every night and money was no object, Lola would definitely make the rotation.  But if I'm having a special meal, the Flying Fig is substantially better across the board, and unless you're really into the specific food at Lola, I think Parallax and Crop are stronger, too (and restaurants like Touch are more adventurous, though obviously in a totally different genre).  

I really wonder how many of the raves about Lola aren't driven by the fact that people are \"supposed\" to rave about Lola; I can understand how people would give this 4 stars, I'm harder pressed to see how people could give it 5.

The food:
- Appetizers.  Everyone ordered a beef cheek; and they're as good as advertised.  The one really exceptional part of the meal.  Another friend had the Lobster soup, which he thought was very strong, I had the Crudo, which was probably the low-light of the meal: it was amazingly tasteless.  I had each of my friends try some to make sure I wasn't being overly critical, but it's clear this is an item to avoid.

- Mains.  Scallops, Pork Shank, and Lamb.  I had the lamb, and felt that it was too salty, but I like less salt than most, so let's call that personal taste.  The real problem is that it wasn't prepared at the correct temperature; I ordered it medium-rare, and it came out medium.  Not an unforgivable sin, but given the venue, I expected more.  My friend thought the scallops were good, but less impressive than the scallops he'd had the night before at Flying Fig.  The pork was apparently good, but not particularly remarkable.

- Wine.  To my discredit, I can't remember the specific wine we ordered.  None of us loved it, but given the near impossibility of pairing a wine with the wide variety of mains we ordered, it's hard to fault their staff or wine selection on this one.

Side note: The service was strong, but not amazing.  For example, one of the servers took our bread plate away and then returned it still missing 3/4s of the butter.  That's a small thing, but given the level of hype with Lola, it's the type of small thing I'd expect them to get right."}
{"text":"Mike Symon's Lola is one of my favorite places to go for lunch.  I always have the scallops wrapped in bacon.  So so yummy."}
{"text":"My first visit to a Simon restaurant and it was wonderful. Great menu and competent service! We ate before the last Cavs game of the season and were not disappointed - I don't think you will either!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for a yummy deconstructed tiramisu and Rye Manhattan. Loved the tiramisu and the bartender David was helpful (and a cutie). Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Lola's on 10/17/09.   We're from the San Francisco Bay area and are bona fide foodies.  My husband is a cook.  Purpose of the trip was to visit the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and eat at Lola's- a surprise weekend for my husband, who was mortified that I brought him to Cleveland.  However, we had a fabulous weekend and eating at Lola's was a highlight.  In short the food and service are stellar.  We started with the  most flavorful and succulent oysters we've ever had, from Island Creek (from New England- MA, I think).  They needed no lemon or sauce of any kind.  I could have just eaten 3 dozen easy.  My husband had the pork pirogis, which he enjoyed very much.  Served in a simple balsamic reduction.  He then had more pork served over a bed of soft polenta, which he loved.  I had the paparadelle with fresh peas and wild mushrooms.  It was perfectly fresh, perfectly seasoned, and perfectly delicious.  I had two classes of a pinot noir from Oregon, which was outstanding.  A little pricey at $14.00 / glass but worth it.  For dessert we shared a square of corn pudding, which had a brulee top, with a strip of caramel to the side and a scoop of blueberry gelato- simple, flavorful but light, and delicious.  The server was attentive as can be and the manager even made the rounds and inquired about our meal, etc.   Our only complaint is that the place is cavernous and loud.  I had to ask my husband to repeat himself all night because I couldn't hear him (I'm a young person :).  The decor didn't do anything for us but the food and service did.  I'd return if I'm ever back in Cleveland."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place. The atmosphere is nice  and the staff are wonderful. I took some out of town guests there for lunch and we fell in love with this place. Our meals were outstanding and the Kitchen Sink Brownie is a piece of pure heaven on a plate. Michael Symon has a winner here and I would highly recommend Lola to everyone. We were lucky enough to meet Michael while we were there and he came and talked to us which just topped the meal off and made our day. Great place, great service and outstanding food!!! This one is a winner."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!!  Our experience was perfect from the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out.  The food is top quality, fresh, and delicious.  The tomato bisque was smooth and flavorful.  The steak and salmon melt in your mouth.  The deserts are wonderful but I highly recommend the Tiramisu.  Our server was very professional, attentive, and prompt.  This is a must try if you're in the city but be prepared to pay for this Iron Chef gem.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I was pleased to enjoy Michael's place after seeing him on Top Recipe Showdown on Food Network. From the show i could see he's all about balance of flavor and GREEK.

He's got balance of flavor down. His Beat salad was divine. Golden Beats, an acidic fruit i cant remember, spring leaves, fresh tomatoes, hazelnuts (my favorite), i think pears, and a yogurt based dressing that serves for your dairy. It was simply perfect.

The Smoked Pork was superb. It's bone in, so he will always get mad points from me for that. But the reduction sauce was rich and salty that brought out the tender texture and juicyness of the meat. Then their is a sweet apple mix, probably with butter and cinnamon, along with very finely julienned chiles that were slightly wilted. TALK ABOUT FLAVOR BALANCE! It was absolutely delicious. The creamy polenta was the right texture to be paired with the dish and it provided all the other flavor profiles you could ask for.  

Bear in mind, this was all eaten out their to-go card board box! I called late, so i thought i would just do take out. Next time i'm in on business i will certainly relax at the bar for a few glasses of wine and some great food.

maybe even try dessert, or just get some bone marrow ; )"}
{"text":"Food and service are great!  I had the Tomato Bisque soup as an appetizer, and really enjoyed it. The Lolaburger was very good. But, the desserts were outstanding!"}
{"text":"Out of town or local MUST!!  I came from Philadelphia for a conference and our hotel was within walking distance.  The vibe is amazing.  The service from hostess to server was outstanding.  The wine, appetizers and entrees (oh and dessert!) were unbelievable!  I had a curry lobster soup, one of the specials, and it was excellent!  My entree of scallops were to die for!  I didn't have room for dessert so we split some and were not disappointed!  Excellent spot and well worth the $!"}
{"text":"Came here on a few occasions for dinner, and loved it. Get the 6 am special for dessert =)"}
{"text":"I'm one happy camper! I ordered the pork chops (medium), and it was served with this delicious cheesy polenta. The pork chops were delicious and tender, and the polenta added a nice touch. The server did remark to me that \"The Chef recommends the pork chops be prepared medium rare or medium\", so that was a nice touch. I was also able to sample the fries - they were flavored with rosemary and came in a side cup. 

Overall, I'm very pleased with my dining experience. The drink menus on iPads were TOO COOL, the ambience and environment were nice, and the service was great. It's everything I'd expect of an iron chef restaurant. 

Btw, I just LOVE how they tell you what you ordered when you receive your food. It always adds an extra brownie point to my yelp reviews. :)"}
{"text":"Great customer service, amazing food, great location, come dressed nicely it's nice and quaint in here. They serve this amazing fresh bread with the most amazing butter. We ordered a nice Malbec from Argentina and it's really good. Waiting for our main entrée and 100% sure it will be as amazing as everything else you've already had. Definitely when in Cleveland come here and check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"woo hoo...Michael Symon knows pork (as well as a bunch of other things...LOL)!
the lobster appetizer was amazing...the soup was delicious...the walleye was cooked perfectly in sauce that highlighted the fish's natural flavors...and the best part was the dessert the 6am Special...you cannot leave this restaurant without tasting this!!!  Heaven on a platter!
Make reservations!"}
{"text":"As a foodie this was one of my \"Bucket List\" & pleased to make it! The whole menu was amazing w/ so many items so I opted for a few apps to try the  different flavors. The Beef Cheek Pierogi definitely could have had another & was yummy w/ a Cab. The Credo was a lovely marriage of flavors & great presentation. Then I tried Split Pea Soup du Jour - topped w/ lobster. All was perfect! The table had the Lamb dish, Chicken & hanger Steak. Everyone was extremely happy w/ their dishes.
Will defiantly return I near future!!"}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to eating here for about 6 years. Since a fellow student in culinary school had told me about it and it's chef. In that time the restaurant has moved and their chef is now a national celebrity. I had tempered my expectations given the fact that Lola now was the flagship restaurant for a nationally renown chef. I was still expecting an extremely high quality meal, but I was prepared to be possibly somewhat let down from my high expectations.

When we go out to a nice dinner my wife and I usually share appetizer and dessert, but for this meal we wanted to experience as much of the menu as we could so we got separate everything.

We started with the pork \"frito misto\" (belly, cracklin & ear) and the beef cheek pierogis. Both were beautifully presented and exquisitely cooked. The sauces on both dishes were excellent, but honestly I'm such a fan of the taste of pork that I really didn't touch much of mine except to dip the crackling in it.

For our entrees we had the berkshire pork chop and the calf heart. 

The calf heart was perfect med-rare, the potatoes were perfect and the celery root puree was smooth as silik. The only knock on the calf heart was the \"salsa verde\" was basically just salty cilantro in some oil with maybe a tiny hint of chile peppers, but as with the appetizer, sauce wasn't really necessary. 

I am so glad that my wife got the pork chop, because not to take anything away from the calf heart, but the little taste I got of her berkshire pork earned it last meal status. I can't say enough about how tender and delicious the pork was. So much more flavor than the bred-to-be-lean pork you get everywhere else. I've never eaten a cut of pork with so much flavor on it's own that wasn't bacon or pork belly. I better stop thinking about it or the drool is going to ruin my keyboard.

Dessert was great as well. I predictably went with the most citrusy thing I could find in the passion fruit parfait, which was really tasty. My wife went for the \"6AM special\" which consisted of brioche french toast and maple bacon ice cream. Her dessert as a whole was fantastic, but on it's own the ice cream was a little salty and smokey with little to no maple taste.

Service was excellent as you'd expect from a fine dining place like this. Not pushy or in your face too much almost unnoticeable except for the fact that you notice when you need something they were always right there.

The atmosphere was very nice, if maybe just a tad darker than necessary. Tables are a little close together, but this seems to be pretty much the norm with even the nicest places any more as places try and cram as many patrons into as little space as they can.

I hope to one day be able to go back again when Chef Symon is there, I think that'd be pretty freaking sweet."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Very elegant place to take someone for a special occasion or classy dinner date."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner on a Saturday night. We ordered the beef cheek and a soup special they were having as an appetizer. The beef cheek was just grainy and mushy and I didnt care for it much at all. Then we had the pork chops and the scallops and they were pretty good. Unfortunately the worst was the server. He seemed to completely ignore us. My husband ran out of wine and water for a while and he never noticed. He forgot to put in the order for one of our dishes and it just wasnt as nice as an experience as it should have been."}
{"text":"I travel a lot and go to a lot of fine restaurants. This is by far the best celebrity chef restaurant I have eaten at in the past 3 years. The beef cheeks pierogis were good, and the pork chop over polenta was one of the tastiest and tenderest I have ever had. But the star of the meal was the brussel sprouts side the had a wonderful and complex flavor - I need that recipe! Expensive, but worth it. $160 for 2 with wine."}
{"text":"My boyfriend's parents took us out for a fantastic meal at Lola last week. The food and service both left little to be desired - seriously, this definitely a place you should check out if you appreciate \"new American\" dishes served in an upscale environment. We were there for almost three hours (and through several bottles of excellent wine!), so it's hard to remember every detail, but here are the highlights:

Special curry cauliflower soup - one of the top 10 soups I've ever had. Delicious, smooth, a tiny bit spicy, and garnished with little lardons. The broth base meant it was light, instead of heavy as a cream-based soup tends to be.

Beef cheek pierogies - a fancy-shmancy take on your ole classic pierogi, but tender and flavorful.

Strip steak with pickle sauce - Okay, I don't know what pickle sauce is, but I want it on EVERY STEAK FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. So, so, so good. It wasn't overpowering, but it made the steak a little juicier and gave it a slight tang that was perfect. If I hadn't been so full, I would have gone to town on the huge serving of frites that came with it, served in a cocktail shaker. 

Peanut Butter & Pretzel - this was our favorite dessert. Peanut-butter chocolate mouse, malted milk ice cream, chocolate covered pretzels = I would definitely order it again. 

The only real \"miss\" at Lola was the Goat Cheesecake. It was clearly meant to be an avante-garde take on a classic cheesecake, deconstructed and displayed elegantly. What it ended up looking like was a very long tubular string of spray cheese. It tasted good, but it was hard to get past the visual. 

All in all, a fantastic dinner. Up there with some of the better NYC and DC restaurants I've eaten at."}
{"text":"solid solid place. came here a while ago with my lady and definitely enjoyed our time. service was top notch, decor was cool, open style kitchen. was a little dark, but okay, was at least able to see what we were eating.

for appetizer, we went with the foie mousse and bone marrow. probably shouldnt have done that because those two things are pretty darn heavy. but what the heck, why not? im sad to say i was a bit disappointed with the bone marrow, im a big marrow fan but they breaded it and deep fried it. why michael symon!? the rest of the accompaniments were very good tho. the foie mousse was solid, the blueberries were a nice touch.

for entrees, we went with the halibut and pork chop. the halibut was cooked very well, it was clean and fresh tasting, lacked a little bit of salt, but overall, a good dish. now, the smoke pork chop. good night that was good. everything about it just works and if youre ever there. make sure to order this. just trust me. you will not be disappointed.

as far as dessert goes, we decided to split the 6am special. if youre not a fan of bacon in your desserts then you might want to steer away from this, but if you are, this is great. everything youd want in a dessert of this type, we enjoyed it very much.

overall, if youre ever in the cleveland area, you should definitely give it a shot. i think you'll enjoy your visit there."}
{"text":"On our road trip back to Boston,  Cleveland was a destination because of Lola. My travel companion has a big ol' foodie crush on Michael Symon and insisted we have dinner here. 

We had a reservation, but got into town much earlier and the hostess was happy to accommodate us.  The service was incredible- every person we interacted with provided an elevated level of professionalism which made everything feel very high-end.  We were lucky enough to have Gina K as our server, she was everything you could hope for during your dining experience!

My friend got the beef cheek pierogis and the pork chop.  The pierogis are a Michael Symon specialty, and were everything he boasts about them: tender, juicy and flavorful. The chops were cooked perfectly, offered a touch of heat and delicious to the last bite. 

Dessert was beautifully crafted, rich and the perfect size for the amount to satiate, but not overwhelm.  We enjoyed the toffee pudding and peppermint patty which were a great juxtaposition of refreshing and decadence.

While I mainly came to this restaurant to help fulfill my friend's dream, I left very pleased with our experience- it was definitely worth a trip to Cleveland to visit Lola.  

Insider's tip: asked to be seated with Gina, she goes well above and beyond to create a special dining experience!"}
{"text":"I liked the food but didn't like the reservation system that limited my Friday night choice to 5pm and 9pm -I took the 5 and the place was mostly empty. The service was excellent, and I loved my steak prefaced by a beef cheek pierogi paired with a CA blend wine that was very drinkable for the cheap wine offering. My wife wasn't too crazy about the reservation system but I suspect that they do it to insure a fixed number of tables and not deal with walkins. It's the best you're going to get in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Came here while in Cleveland for a conference and it was divine! Definitely lives up to the hype. The food here was superb. I was a little uninspired by the menu at first, and it is on the pricey side at about $30+ per entree, but the flavors and food quality make it worth it. I had their signature pork chop and I was SO surprised with how generous the portion was! The meat was tender, smokey, and sweet all at once and it was served over creamy polenta, which almost stole the show (that's how good it was). I ate all of it, even though I was uncomfortably full, because it was so tasty. Other in my party had the hangar steak, french fries, summer vegetables, and the brussels sprouts. I tried some of the fries and the brussels sprouts and would have been perfectly content just eating those for dinner. This is truly a lot of food, so be prepared, and it helps justify the price. Reservations essentially required, though they do serve the full menu at the bar. If you are in Cleveland, I highly, highly recommend trying to come here for dinner. Can't comment on parking, as we took Lyft here."}
{"text":"I love Lola. Well- priced and selected options for a business lunch. Dim lit and decorated to make a date night special. Went last Valentine's day and ordered the beef cheek pierogi app and sturgeon. One of the best fish dishes I've every ordered. Partner got the hanger steak and famous lola fries. I often come and read the menu and think nothing sound like something I would enjoy, then I order and am always amazed. I didn't even know I liked beef cheek or pork schnitzel..."}
{"text":"Lola was a nice surprise...wasn't expecting much from the vacant streets of Cleveland.  The restaurant's decor is a lot like the upscale restaurants in Dallas and Atlanta.  I had the beef cheek pierogi and crispy bone marrow.  The beef cheek pierogi tasted a lot like your typical beef brisket.  It was wrapped in a dumpling.  Really good, but not really worth the price.  The Crispy bone marrow was basically fried fat.  I eat single portions when eating out,  but the marrow was so rich, I couldn't eat anything else!  It was interesting in that it came with 8 sauces you can put on the bone marrow spread."}
{"text":"The food was good tonight - loved my scallops and the hubs loved his beet salad...but the service was SO slow...surprised me knowing they'd want to keep turning over the tables. Prices were better than expected. Great dark atmosphere...very cool vibe inside."}
{"text":"Wow! Lola was fantastic!!! We went for our anniversary which also ended up being Mother's Day. We were very impressed. First they allow you to choose your drink off of an iPad of sorts. Lots of yummy cocktails. I unfortunately chose the bad drink. The sweet pea sangria just tasted like bitter white wine. I didn't like. Afterwards I order a glass of the pinot and it was great. 

For apps we were adventurous and got the sweetbreads and the beef cheek pierogies. The pierogies were fantastic! The sweetbreads were lightly fried and had a great flavor. I was freaked out by them being thymus glands and only had 3 bites but my husband was in love! 

For entrees I had the smoked pork chop which was phenomenal! It tasted like a bacon chop. Soooo good and juicy and tender! My husband had the ribeye and he said it was one of the best pieces of meat he has ever had!

For dessert he got a toffee delight that had figs in it. There was such interesting things going on in this dessert. Yum! I got the peanut butter and chocolate dessert. So good! A nice balance of sweet and salty. My fave! 

We also picked up a signed copy of Michael Symon's book for $30 bucks or so. What a great experience! Great staff as well!!"}
{"text":"My cousin and I went here just to sample a few appetizers because of Michael Symon. We sat at the bar and the bartender was extremely friendly and engaging. The service was delightful and the atmosphere was relaxing. The old fashioned was strong and the bartender educated us a little about the different bourbons and whiskeys. It was a great experience. We tried the charcuterie plate which changes every day. It came with a restaurant made pork rind that was to die for. It was perfectly crisp and even looks amazing. The rest of the plate was fun to taste and try. We also go the bone marrow. It comes with five pieces and is extremely rich in flavor. This is a must try along with the pork rind. Although both were a little salty for my liking. The texture for those two items were spot on. Lastly, we got the pierogi. Again, this dish was rich in flavor like the other dishes. These appetizers were all very rich, so splitting a small portion was perfect for us two. The bill came out to be a little under $100, but it was money well spent."}
{"text":"The beef cheek pierogi and the smoked pork chop (get it med rare) were both really good. I'm torn here because The food was really good! But to the level of four stars? I feel like the food was really good but didn't live up to the expectations. I mean the ambiance was immaculate and there was a large exposed kitchen area with lots of staff and even a large French top stove so I'd think the food would be a little more gourmet? Walking into this restaurant you'd think you would have some of the best food of your life. Kudos to the designer of the restaurant and for the kitchen staff for the effort. I gave Lola three stars for the food and an additional star for the service and ambiance."}
{"text":"Great service and fantastic menu all around. What stood out the most for us was the dessert menu....all homemade and very unique."}
{"text":"Great dining experience while visiting Cleveland. Restaurant is on par with places in NYC, San Fran, and Chicago. Decor was contemporary and cool with a lounge feel. It also has an industrial feel which pays tribute to a city with such an iconic industrial past. I had the scallops as a main which were cooked perfectly. The bacon bits and the presentation were nice touches. My friend had the pork chop that he thought was one of the best he's had. I'd recommend this place."}
{"text":"Like most \"celebrity\" restaurants, this one suffers from some unrealistic expectations. Unlike many, however, this one is actually good. It's not the best or most creative place in Cleveland, and some of the less than stellar experiences detailed in reviews are valid, but overall it's a solid place. Some of the dishes are exceptional -- the pierogi and the pork chop come to mind -- and my experiences have been good. For me, it loses a star for uneven service and a dearth of choices for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Great service and food! My boyfriend and I celebrate our 5yr together and they gave us a cute plate with cupcakes and candles. I do have to say get the brussel sprouts, Berkeley check pierogi and the lamb shank! Delicious!!"}
{"text":"This review would have been a 3.3 rating...so being as it must be rounded to whole number, this becomes a 3. Lola is a cool after work place for the hip and well-to-do in a nice area of downtown Cleveland tucked away on what looks like a pedestrian-only street. The food and the atmosphere is on the fancier side, not that you can go in jeans...my friend's and I went there after being in a car for five hours.

The food is first class Michael Symon, fancy down-home-cooking. For appys, we had the bone marrow, yuzu tuna poke and glazed pork belly. Surprise surprise, the pork belly was the overwhelming hit! I mean who doesn't love layers upon layers of delectable fatty pork? The poke was great too, but the yuzu overwhelmed the clean tuna flavour. And is there such a thing as too fatty? Well, that would be fried bone marrow. Greasy bread crumbs surrounding already melting juicy meaty goodness might just be too much of a good thing. There were five pieces and each one of us could only finish one, two were left to leftover heaven. :(

As for the main, I can only comment on my own which was lamb hearts over fava bean puree. The heart was cooked perfectly medium rare, allowing it to be lean, juicy and meaty all at the same time. There was a good amount of char on the heart meat giving the meat greater depth of flavour. The fava bean puree? Most delicious thing ever! Looks like baby food, but if that was what baby food tasted like...then send me over a jar! 

The only that brought this rating down was the service. We were a group of six and asked for separate bills. From that moment on, the attitude of our waitress changed. She took at least 20 min to get us our bills, of which she separated incorrectly. She passed by our table at least five times before we got her attention and by that point we decided not to correct the changes and just pay. She then had a sour face the whole time we were using the credit card machine. There was automatic gratuity for tables of six and over, you'd think she'd be happy to have a larger table. I just feel her attitude could have been better. You never let the customer know that you are upset."}
{"text":"Came here on an impromptu date night last Friday. Being in Cleveland for almost two years it was beyond us why we haven't been here yet. Using the trusted open table app we secured a reservation on the drive down and were seated right away.. I had a view of the kitchen which was nice to see. Very clean and organized. Food was amazing. I had a pork shank that melted like butter on the fork and my fiance had the Hanger Steak which was equally as delicious. Price was about what you expect for a 4th street restaurant. We will be back.."}
{"text":"Salty meats, wines were ok.

I think I got a pork shank, my dining companion the steak with mushrooms. I liked it, but to honest it was not amazing. And for some reason, not to disrespect cleveland (my hometown) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysmLA5TqbIY, but i felt it under delivered for the price...  in fact felt like I was eating at one of tom collichio's restaurants or something, super trendy, kind of uninviting, but none of the food was particularly innovative, just really really well seasoned red meats.

AND they ran out of the malbec that we asked for and gave us some weird blend, which was not great.  Got oysters as an appetizer, I love oysters.

I think if this place was in New York, which at a glance it feels like what  Michael Symon is going for with the atmosphere, it would be a plain jane bar and grill on the one of the upper west or east sides.  There is nothing to improve upon, it was a good and satisfying meal.




Go Cavs!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Very metropolitan feel, very attentive and knowledgable staff, and outstanding food. Great before a Cavs game."}
{"text":"I came here with friends once and we had a nice time. It was hard to find parking but the food was delicious. We were expecting a lot considering the hype this place gets and we all enjoyed our meals, though it was a little expensive. The lighting was also pretty dark to the point where we were laughing about how we couldn't see each other."}
{"text":"very excited to go to this restaurant as it was highly recommended by my brother.  Arrived right on time to an empty restaurant!  We were promptly seated to a tiny table at the back of the restaurant.   When we asked to be moved to a larger table we were told that it was reserved. The only other option was another tiny table behind a huge post!  We left!

I don't even want to give them one star but it is my only choice to post this review!"}
{"text":"Disappointing
We chose to go to Lola for dinner last week when we had some out of town visitors in for a meeting.  We were all really looking forward to dinner.

We arrived a few minutes early and were seated rapidly. The space is really nice and the wine bar area is really cool.

We ordered appetizers. Pierogis, pork belly and a few others. These were the highlight of the meal.   Excellent. 

About TWO hours later our meals came. Really 2 hours. We were apologized to 6 times.  You know, \"sorry it is taking so long, your entrees will be here in a few moments\".   Our waitress was not one of the staff who apologized. Seemed odd. 

I had the hanger steak and it was cold and overdone. The shellfish dish was ok. The trout was excellent. The cavatelli was overlooked and also cold. We hesitated sending the food back because we were unsure of how long it would take.   

It seemed to me that because the wait staff was embarrassed by the kitchen performance, we were neglected.   We ordered one bottle of wine, would have liked another but didn't get the chance to order it.  

So, you can probably tell that we won't be back. The next day we went to Johnny's Bar. It was superb. The third night we went to parallax. Amazing!  

I don't know why I am giving Lola two stars. None of us will ever return.   I guess it is because I always root for the Cleveland guys."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch, and while most people agreed that the food was good, the portions were small for them.  I had the mac and cheese, which I thought was pretty good.  I was surprised that the \"mac\" part of the dish had penne pasta, and not actual macaroni, but the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, and the sauce had interesting hints of goat cheese in it.  There was roasted chicken also in the entree.  It was really rich, and I was very full from my meal afterwards.

I'm not sure if I'd be willing to go back again simply because parking downtown is a nightmare.  After circling the block many times in a futile effort to look for metered parking close to the area, we finally decided to park in the garage, which was extremely expensive.  The parking cost almost as much as my meal!

Lunch:
Mac and Cheese: $14
Garage parking (200 Public Square Garage):  $12 for a little over an hour"}
{"text":"This place is hip chic and fun.  I had a blast just sitting at the bar chatting it up with the locals and the bartenders.  I highly recommend doing the same if you travel solo for biz like I do.

One of the items I tried was the \"Duck - magret breast, corn, peaches, moI\" was told it was new on the menue. If you are a fan of duck this ranks way up there with some of the best.  I wouldn't recommend it if you are trying duck for the first time.

Other items I tasted were -

Pork Belly
\"buffalo pig ear\", shaved celery, blue cheese, apple 12

Ceviche
orange, fresno, radish, scallion 14

Beef Cheek Pierogi
wild mushrooms, horseradish, crème fraiche 12

All equally tasty.

If you are within an hour of this place it's a must go kinda place"}
{"text":"Good wine, get the beef cheek perogies. Meat is cooked perfectly. Can;t really go wrong, but known for their steak."}
{"text":"I made it! Finally. You know when the anticipation is more than the experience itself? Not in this case, baby! Every time I'm in Cleveland, it's for the day on a weekend and usually I'm out and gone before 5 o'clock....so no Lola before 5 on a weekend. 

On my way through Cleveland this time, I met up with the kid and we hit lunch and drinks at the bar on Friday. David was our beverage magician who created their signature Gin-gin Flower for me and a grapefruit-based signature drink for the kid (she's 25 - still a kid to me, so don't get freaked out about letting a \"kid\" drink, okay?) The Gin-gin Flower was a divine concoction of gin (duh), ginger, violet and other amazing elixirs that was sinfully, decadently delightful. So many levels of flavors going off on my palate both simultaneously and sequentially that it was almost like quiet fireworks. Thanks, David, you were wonderful! 

We shared the charcuterie platter (stopped at The Greenhouse Tavern first for drinks and apps there), which was a composed art of cured meat beauties, pickled red onions, pickled ramps, cornichons and stone ground mustard displayed on a wooden board. Baguette discs to spread and pile the delights onto accompanied the board. 

First off, the pork rillette was a smooth and creamy explosion of almost sexy flavor. I could swear there was an herbal quality to it, but was assured the only ingredients were pork, salt and pork fat. Wow. Thin slices of garlicky pork salami were perfectly, wonderfully satisfying. The prosciutto was so soft, sweet and tender it nearly melted in the mouth. Our least favorite was the cured pork loin - not that it wasn't good, it just didn't quite hit the same high notes as the others on the board. 

BTW, this visit made my trifecta of Michael Symon restaurant visits in Cleveland....first experience was the top notch Lolita, then the B-Spot (actually I've been to both the Woodmere and Strongsville locations....Crocker Park next for the trifecta of B-Spots!) and Lola makes three. Thanks, Michael, for offering nothing but the best to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Lolita was better - smaller, more atmosphere, simpler (but better tasting) food...

However, the location is great. Get reservations. And get the pork belly/bacon.

Won't be coming back, only because I'm going to go to Lolita instead"}
{"text":"Meet your new Iron Chef! (And we did) Was heading to Cleveland and, after seeing Michael on TV, we definitely wanted to try his restaurant(s). And we so glad we did. Who knew Cleveland had a budding food scene.  We had lunch on  Friday and the place was packed. The room is modern with an open kitchen. Our waiter, Tony, was top notch (he mentioned he had been GM when the opened in the new space but wanted to get back in touch with the people). 

Of course, the food. Delicious contemporary American with some European flair. After debating between the charcuterie and the BACON, I went with the bacon (pork belly) and it was spot on. Tender, smokey and BACON. Followed it up with the scallops which, while still tasty, we're slightly over shadowed by the bacon. My companion went with the gnocchi and chicken salad. Solid (gnocchi) and good (chix salad but it's chicken salad). Oh, and the fries....definitely order the fries. They also had a tomato bisque that looked yummy. And a top notch wine list with some wines I haven't even seen at places here in the Bay Area.

And not only was Michael there but he was expediting the line during lunch service. His new found celebrity has definitely not gone to his head.

In parting, three words: GO GO GO.

(They also have a great lunch deal: soup and/or salad and/or half sandwich combo for $11)"}
{"text":"I have been to Lola a handful of times, whether with clients or a group of friends, and it never ceases to amaze me. Michael Symon is definitely doing something right when he creates the menu's for his restaurants. The one meal that really sticks out to me was a Pork Chop with a side of cheesy polenta. It was one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great bite to eat in the Cleveland area. 

Along with the excellent food, the service at Lola is fantastic. The waiters and bartenders all have a very firm grasp on the menu and will steer you in the right direction while taking into account the type of meal you are looking for. 

The restaurant itself has a great decor and feel about it. Whether you are on a business meeting or on a romantic dinner, the atmosphere will make anyone feel comfortable. I highly recommend Lola to local Clevelanders and also to anyone traveling into the city as one of the best representations of the new and vibrant food scene that Cleveland has to offer."}
{"text":"Seriously? Cleveland, OH? Get ready to have your stomach slam dunked with a delicious dish served from Lebron James, well not really but I felt like my experience was equally cool.  

This place is bad ass.  Definitely the best food you will find in Cleveland and probably Ohio.

Lola has a great menu with fantastic food.  This place also has a fantastic atmosphere with great design.  

We ordered the Hanger Steak and Lamb Shank

The Hanger Steak was perfect.  Tender and well seasoned with a fantastic sauce and the dressing on the dish.  Everything tied together very well on this dish.  This also came with some Lola Fries, which were probably THE BEST FRIES I HAVE EVER HAD.  They had like sea salt and rosemary on them.  Absolutely fantastic.

The Lamb Shank was also freaking good.  It was so tender it was falling off the bone.  The sauce and dressings it was with were very very flavorful.  The Lamb was seasoned well and roasted to perfection.  Nice and salty and oh so good.

This place really surprised me, and it was a fantastic evening."}
{"text":"We had lunch here. The menu was very affordable & we sat outside in very casual clothes. The red pepper soup was amazing."}
{"text":"If you eat in any one place in Cleveland, eat here. You won't need a menu. Just order:

Beef Cheek Perogies

Short Ribs

Bacon/Maple Ice Cream"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night, had drinks but very slow service at the bar, but the cool thing was the Ipad and Wine Cellar, very reasonable drink prices,  didn't eat dinner but ate next door, overall   A OK solid place !"}
{"text":"My review of Lola comes after my second time dining here. The first time was back in January of 2012 when we were in town for a show & it was one of my top 5 meals ever. The charcuterie was thoughtful, creative, & delicious & my pork chop was amazing, but the star of the show was my husband's ribeye. It was the most delicious steak any of our party of four had ever tasted. It was so good that it had to be shared (if it had been my order, I wouldn't have made a big deal about it because then I would've been able to eat more of it but my hubby is nicer than me). There was a lot of moaning & eye-rolling (the good kind) involved anytime someone (especially me) would take a bite. Everything about that meal was fantastic, but it all paled in comparison to that ribeye. Absolute perfection. 

Fast forward to last week. My husband & I were catching a show in Cleveland again & couldn't wait to dine at Lola again after that epic experience. If I had known how disappointing it would be in comparison, I would have never gone again. They no longer offer the charcuterie & although the pork belly & pig ear appetizer & heirloom tomato salad were excellent, the entrees were disappointing. My salmon was overcooked & the version of the ribeye my hubby had this time was way too salty & nowhere near as monumental as the last time. The chocolate chip dessert was weird & didn't make sense. In fact, the 6am special was kind of forgettable last time too. Not impressed with the desserts at all. 

So, all in all, I still give it 4 stars, but we definitely questioned whether the meal was worth the $200 we spent this time. The first time, it was a no-brainer."}
{"text":"I want to say, first and foremost food was great, setting was very nice...however, my boyfriend and I were seated at this table and my chair was not comfortable at all. They replaced it with a new one and it was exactly the same problem, your butt kinda fall and hits the wooden part. He actually switched with me and agreed. The staff were okay. Definitely didn't get the same treatment as the other tables next to us, meaning barely checked on us, didn't follow up with the seats, didn't really clean the table after the bread/appetizers. I wish I had a better experience."}
{"text":"Because birthdays come only once a year and because my sister had come to visit all the way from Los Angeles and because it was her birthday about 2 weeks ago, we decided it was necessary to treat ourselves to a nice dinner. I don't think the two of us had sat down to a fancy dinner, just the two of us, so this was a real special one for me.

Of course, because the parents aren't around to shake their heads, we got a cocktail! Surprisingly they weren't too expensive at around 10-12 dollars. They were just okay, however. My sister said hers was too sweet. I like that I could taste the bourbon in mine, but it overall it wasn't exceptional. 

We ordered the pig ears for appetizer. Yum. It reminded me of an asian dish because we do have crispy pig ears occasionally and because the vinegar and spices they used reminded me of nuoc mum, a vietnamese sauce. I would recommend it!

I got the roasted duck breast which was amazing. So good. So tender and packed with so much earthy flavors. The mushrooms really hit the spot. I pretty much licked it clean despite being so full. My sister got the scallops which were a tad salty, but she was gleaming from having 5 scallops! Certainly we didn't expect the portion to be so generous. She loved the corn salad/sauce that the scallops rested on. 

We couldn't get dessert because were were already so full. 


This place didn't disappoint! It was great and it really topped off our little vacation."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday last Friday. I had been wanting to go to Lola for some time now and it was worth the wait. Everything was perfect we started with the bone marrow, followed by the perogies than we split the duck all with a Qupe Syrah which was very special cause it was from my home town. The food was all cooked to perfection and the wine list is very extensive which can be intimidating but they bring it on an iPad and that makes it fun and easy to find something in your price range that will pair with your meal. This all being said its something to be expected but it was the staff that really made this night so special. From the moment we walked in till they hand us our coats to leave each staff was warm welcoming and very helpful.  We never felt rushed each course came out at a perfect pace our wine or water glasses seemed to magically fill them selves. The perfect mix of great service of anticipating your needs and there to answer any questions with out feeling like any one is hovering. Aurora was exceptionally knowledgeable and friendly. We will definitely be back thank you very much for everyone make this night so rememberable."}
{"text":"I wish it was located next door. The food and the service is absolutely scrumptious !!!
It was a nice crowd. The servers are attentive. The food is off the chain!  I won't tell you about dessert because I do not want there to be a line down the street to get in next time."}
{"text":"I originally was going to give two stars because after ordering the cioppino, the broth was tinny. Frankly, I make a more full-bodied cioppino with a homemade turkey broth and made-from-scratch marinara sauce combined to form a tomato soup like \"liquid gold\" as my father describes it (he used to own a restaurant). Therefore, I had high expectations visiting Michael Symon's restaurant but was disappointed. In addition, I ordered the roasted asparagus, which came with blobs of cheese on it. The asparagus had so much oil it was soggy, in contrast to the Grand Hyatt Seattle's Grand Club which uses a drier grilling method to obtain that perfect char on the ends (asparagus there was EXCELLENT).

I added a star though for the customer service. I asked the bartender for hot chocolate but unfortunately the restaurant did not sell this. About ten minutes later, the bartender arrived with a custom-made hot chocolate! She had asked the dessert chef for some chocolate shavings and used the cappuccino machine to steam milk to create the drink. I was astounded and very grateful since it was a bit chilly outside. It was delicious, and the best item I had at the restaurant!"}
{"text":"My wife and I took a little weekend trip to Cleveland to celebrate her birthday and for a Cavs game to try and see LeBron get his 30,000th career point.  While the Cavs disappointed, Lola certainly did not mess up her birthday dinner.  The food was spot on and delicious.  We shared the beets and grains appetizer which was unique.  I had the scallops entree and my wife had the lamb shank.  They brought out a cupcake for her birthday which was a nice touch, and we shared the Lola S'more.  Overall, great service, a great location, and a wonderful meal.  I would highly recommend to anyone in the Cleveland area looking for a nice place to grab an upscale meal.  We will have to try Chef Symon's BBQ restaurant Mabel's, located next door, on another visit!"}
{"text":"Good meal in great location. Lost a star for inattentive service. 

Marrow appetizer was very good, but not worth $25.  Scallops, Hanger steak and sauce were great."}
{"text":"Stopped here while I was in town for Cleveland clinic. I started out with the beef cheek pirogies, they were so flavorful and moist, great appetizer. As a main course I had the scallops, they were cooked good but much too salty. My friend had the burger, it was overcooked and did not impress. Overall great start poor finish."}
{"text":"Service 4.5/5
Food 5/5

Because of the hype around this place I tried to come in with a very objective mindset.

We made reservations before we went to a Cavs game and I was somewhat worried about being underdressed, but it had a surprisingly casual feel for being an upscale establishment and I didn't feel at all out of place. 

We ordered the Pork Belly and Oysters as appetizers, both of which were great. 

The steak was the real highlight of my meal though. By my personal scale for an establishment to have 5/5 on food it REALLY needs to be exceptional. The Hanger steak may have been the best steak I've ever had. I ordered medium rare and the it arrived perfectly seared with a slight crunch yet a deep reddish pink on the inside. The cut itself was flawless, slightly marbled yet so tender that it almost melted in my mouth. 

My experience at Lola definitely lived up to if not exceeded the hype."}
{"text":"If I could get one meal that was at least tepid in temperature I'd try again. Maybe if I tote a microwave with me? Anyway when your with someone and their food is okay it's a pain to send your food back for a heat up because they either have to eat without you or sit there waiting for the server to remember to come back. Not going back. So many better spots in Cleveland area like l'Albatros"}
{"text":"Went on a wednesday, March 6 and sat in the window zone with party of four and the experience was divine. The waitress was wonderful and she had perfect timing. 
The bone marrow was indescribable, american ham selection was devoured, the beef cheek pierogi was okay. The entrees were perfection.  Dessert for all was enjoyed.

About the Bone Marrow: I don't know how or what the process was but it was crispy on the outside and creamy inside.  I was very wary of ordering what amounts to fat but I was so surprised.  You must try this even if you do not like fat.

Went back on Friday, March 8 with party of 2 and got seated on the back wall next to the large corner booth/table.  This was not a desired seat, one stared at the wall, one stared out at the room while both were faced staring (closely) at the backs of the waiters attending to the large corner table.  The Michael Symon Look-a-like waiter kind of meandered around acting important but didn't add any knowledge to our ordering process or service.  Seems silly, but I didn't know Poke was not my cup of tea, my husband forgot to order those delicious fries, and our meal needed an extra bump which was that order of fries. For that much money, I should have already been attended to make sure everything was fine. I couldn't wait to get the check. No one likes being ignored. I guess I should have tipped the waiter before the dinner service began.

Would have gotten five stars but second time the service was disappointing. 

 We spent over $650 on what was 6 adult dinners on two separate nights.  I have no idea how much the Lolita cost because the other couple picked up that tab but I'm assuming is was at least $100 each. That means that the four of us spent over $1000 dining and I should be giving a 5 star review to both Lola and Lolita. Oh well."}
{"text":"Came out to Cleveland for a long weekend for my birthday. A big reason was to check out Lola. It did not disappoint.

We started out with the Crispy Veal Sweetbreads. Just a little bit crispy on the outside and incredibly tender. Quite delicious. For my entree, I had the lamb. It comes rare on a bed of cannelloni beans and greens. I adore lamb, and this one one of the best pieces I've had. We also split a side of Lola fries, which are shoestring frites, served hot and perfectly salted in a cocktail shaker. Of course, I had to go with the 6am special for dessert. I don't think I need to say any more about that.

While the food was great, Lola is just a really fun place for a nice restaurant. Let me tell you about our server... so I ask for a recommendation between the scallops and the lamb for dinner. Our server takes a moment, looks really thoughtful, writes something down, and then walks away. I didn't find out what his recommendation was until they brought the lamb out. My girlfriend got the same treatment when she asked for a wine recommendation. Maybe it wouldn't have been funny if he didn't pick well..."}
{"text":"the cheesy polenta, what!! it was awesome. Everything that we had that night was great we were a party of 4 and we all shared our dishes with each other so we could taste everything. All the food was cooked perfectly we didn't have any complaints at all. Some of the food may have been a little bit pricey, but I get it. I would go back for a special occasion or if I had some out of town foodie guests."}
{"text":"Fantastic.

The woman and I are both foodies and love the work of Michael Symon (and fortunately both love pork) so while in Cleveland, Lola seemed like an obvious destination to eat. We booked a reservation the day before and were left with a 9pm seat at the earliest - no problem that a late lunch couldn't solve. So after a day at the West Side Market and avoiding the rain in Cleveland it was off to Lola's downtown.

The menu was relatively simple, a one-sided affair with 5-6 options for each of the three courses. Following the advice of other Yelpers, for appetizers we had the beef cheek perogies and the pork belly and pig's ear. The perogies were as advertised - the perfectly cooked beef melted in your mouth and had the perfect soft consistency. The crispy pork belly and pig's ear with bits of mango and melon blew my mind. The dish was a perfect combination of sweet-and-salty tastes and fatty-and-crispy textures. While I can see how some people might not like a dish like this, I'm glad I'm not one of them. 

For the main course she ordered the grilled calf's heart with creamed corn, morels, and chimichurri sauce. I opted for the smoked Berkshire pork chop with chiles, cheesy polenta, and barbecued onions. Hers was good, mine was mind blowingly so. Without a doubt the tastiest piece of pig I've ever had in my life. Perfectly cooked - tender on the insides, the fatty outsides were crispy and smooth. The base of creamy cheesy polenta combined with the barbecued onions and juices from the pork complemented the dish perfectly. After one bite both she and I had that universal \"oh man is that good\" moment. 

Despite being epically full at this point, the dessert menu kept calling our names with two taunting dishes. The first was called the \"6am Special\" - an ungodly good concoction of brioche french toast, caramelized apples, and topped with the most incredible maple-bacon ice cream. Wow. There's something so incredibly perfect about that dish that words can't convey. If you get to Cleveland that dessert is worth the trip alone. We also got the \"chocolate and doughnuts\" dessert which paired an incredibly delicious (yet tiny!) cup of hot chocolate with some freshly made honey fruit glaze doughnuts. Good, but no 6am.

It was an amazing meal, and for those of you keeping track at home - yes; I had 3 courses, each one of them with pork in it. That's Michael Symon for you."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place. I went with a coworker and had a reservation for 7. We had to wait about ten minutes to be seated, but it was no big deal as the bar area is quite spacious and lounge-y so is a good place to have a drink before dinner. The ambiance is very cozy and has a cool urban feel. 

Our waiter, Joe, was fantastic, and took the time to explain certain dishes to us and gave us recommendations. Our drinks were constantly refilled and every course came out evenly spaced.

The food. We started with the pierogi (recommended by Joe though we had already decided on that). Buttery and delicious. For my entree, I had the lamb, my coworker had the strip. The lamb was some of the best I have ever had. Just fantastic. Dessert was the Almond Financier which was great, though the dried fruit on top was a little odd and detracted from an otherwise excellent dish. Every table receives chocolate truffles with their check, which is such a fabulous way to end a meal. The portions are just enough to fill you up without making you want to roll out of the restaurant.

I even left a shopping bag behind after we left and the restaurant was quick to locate my phone number and give me a call. Fantastic service all around and even better food. Definitely eat here if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Oh, Lola. Outside of the incredibly pretentious crowd, this place was a fantastic visit during our weekend in Cleveland!

I had the lamb heart and oh-dear-God was it finger-licking delicious. Such a divine treat. I would order it again in a second. It's hard to describe the taste of it so I just recommend ordering it if you're ever in this restaurant.

We sat at the bar (well, duh) and chatted with the super awesome bartender. The place was packed and we didn't feel like waiting over an hour for a table. The interior is of modern decor with low lighting. The bar had lighting accents around it that gave it a very date vibe feel. If you're looking to impress yo' lady, I suggest you bring her here. 

I know we ordered a bottle of wine that we didn't finish (I was too into my lamb heart. And my boyfriend's hanger steak). That's right, he ordered hanger steak. I hate to break it to the excellent chefs at Lola's, but Meat & Potatoes in Pittsburgh still has the best hanger steak I have ever had. Not to say the one at Lola's wasn't good. It was excellent, but only one place I've ever been to seems to actually get \"rare\" right when its asked for ..."}
{"text":"Great place. Nice ambiance, attentive hostess and waitress.  

Pork belly app was very good and very tasty. The duck was cook to a perfect medium rare and was very well balanced. Would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The fat babymoon started here..

On the tab
Bone Marrow: overload for 2 people but very fatty good. The blue cheese with roast garlic sauce was amazing
Duck Mousse: If it was anything over $12, I would have been thoroughly disappointed
Pierogi: Not enough texture for me but overall it was good
Pork Chops: were AMAZING and the creamy polenta was to die for! Highly recommended
Bacon Ice cream: was really salty for me but nice concept

The restaurant had amazing service, which I would have expected any less. The bread that they give you is a waste of space so don't eat it. The bar area had young people but the actual restaurant area was filled with old people. I would have given this place 3 stars but for a celebrity chef (usually disgusting) this place lived up to the hype."}
{"text":"Just had one of the finest meals ever.  LOVE the sweetbread appetizer.  Perfect size too.  The signature beef cheek pierogi was very good, but IMHO, the sweetbreads rule.  Cant wait to go in for a boloney sangwich for lunch.  Bravo Michael Simon."}
{"text":"I was so excited to get to try this restaurant from Michael Symon- love checking out fabulous restaurants when we are traveling. I thought the restaurant was beautiful- nestled right on a street full of great shops and other fine restaurants- I wouldn't even need to see the rest of the city really.

The ambiance of the restaurant was great, and the service was impeccable. Our waitress was even willing to take our photo and gave us one of the best photos of our trip.

The food was also excellent. I first enjoyed my chili margarita (just the right amount of spice) before we dove into the Bone Marrow appetizer that everyone raves about. I had never tried this item before, and it did not disappoint (though it was very rich- don't think I could eat it often for sure). Our waitress suggested a fabulous way to eat it, and we were not disappointed. We did the duck and trout for our entrees- both loved them- my husband literally would have licked his plate if he could. We finished off with the sticky toffee pudding which was not as sweet as places in the past- and I appreciated the flavor. Finished the evening with a glass of sangria- and walked out into the beautiful snowy evening having enjoyed a great meal in a great city. Definitely a gem to check out when in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"The whole reason we went to Cleveland was to eat at Lola, Iron Chef Michael Symon's restaurant. JK We came to visit my boyfriend's brother and wife. =) This was one of the best meals of my life. 

We started off with Crispy Bone Marrow, which included toast, caramelized onions, salsa verde, lemon, parsley, pickled red onions and salt.  The idea was to spread the bone marrow on the toast and dress it as you pleased.  I found that I really loved the salsa verde, pickled red onions, parsley spritzed with lemon, best.  The server said to use the marrow as you would use butter. Honestly, I would never put that much butter on anything; however, I was at an Iron Chef's restaurant, so I just had to.  It was probably the most indulgent thing I've ever eaten! The next appetizer was Beef Cheek Pierogis.  I can't stress enough how much I love tender, braised meat!

For my entrée, I ordered the Rib Eye Steak with blue cheese crust and wild mushrooms.  It was so rich and delicious, I could only eat a third of it!  It was also cooked to a perfect medium rare.  

For dessert, we split a green apple panna cotta. It really was like eating a green apple.

Michael Symon himself stopped by our table!!!  He's quite handsome.  And it's true, the camera does add 10 lbs.- more like 20 lbs.  I had no idea he was so tall and handsome!

I'd love to come here again!"}
{"text":"Good food and amazing service.  However I hate to say I am still going to Morton's over Lola when i make the long drive to Cleveland."}
{"text":"I'm sure I'll have better luck in Cleveland at some point.

Very disappointing, but was expecting more as I'm a fan of Mr. Symon.

The good.  Nice ambiance.  Nice presentation. Wait staff polite.

What else.....salty, salty, salty.  
Hangar steak like chewy rubber and never have I had fries that spring back when you bite them.  Felt like it was sitting around for a while.  I literally spit out almost half of the meal (i.e., the hangar steak)  and covered it with my napkin.  Surely, I could have said something, and perhaps should have in retrospect.

Scallops.  Nice flavor, but salt bomb.  Not much else need be said.








House made complimentary caramel.  Just"}
{"text":"Loved this place,  tried it for the first time and we went there for my friend's birthday, I ordered their lentil Entre that also had a lot of roasted vegetables, it was actually very well seasoned and spicy. Might have been a little too hot for me but still it was delicious, I also ordered a side of mushrooms which were excellent."}
{"text":"Ah, my foodie journey across the Great Lakes region on a recent road trip officially started at Lola. And it was a beautiful start. 

Upon entering the restaurants, I quickly glanced around to admire the modern and refined interiors. My glance continued running through the dining room and later fixated at the open kitchen as we were promptly seated before the arrival of the lunch crowd. 

Prior to my visit, I checked the lunch menu online. I found it difficult to believe the prices I saw. My suspicions were quickly eased away when I opened a menu that is nearly identical to the menu online. That quickly brought a smile to my face. Where else can you find an Iron Chef flagship restaurant where nearly all of the lunch entrees were under $18. You can even get a lunch combo of half sandwich and soup/salad for merely $12! 

Opting to try a real entrée dish, I chose the Chicken Paillard served with figs, goat cheese, frisee, and pistachio. As I first try to taste each component individually, none of the components left a strong impression. However, when I composed my bite with all the components together, they all worked wonderfully in harmony to capture your full attention. 

After enjoying a delightful entrée, I decided I had to try to dessert. Coconut lime cake with whipped cream and vanilla-flavored pineapple sounded too good to pass up. Although it was a cake served with whipped cream, the lime and pineapple perfectly lightened it up and made it a great summer dessert. 

With delicious food, beautiful decors, attentive service, and reasonable prices, it had all the right ingredients to make it a five-star establishment. My rating is actually closer to a 5 than a 4; I am only holding back because I haven't sampled enough of its food."}
{"text":"Lola features a pretty space, an impressive wine collection, and nice little touches throughout your meal.  I tried the pork belly...excellent, with a definite Vietnamese flair.  Also had the beef cheek pierogies...great texture and gravy with deep flavor.  Sturgeon as entree...nicely cooked and presented atop potatoes and potato puree.

I'd like to get a seat in front of the open kitchen if I have a chance to revisit.  The bar area got crowded around 7 on a Friday night. 

Conversation overheard:  Innovation is not going to PNC's website and seeing what they're doing!"}
{"text":"I am visiting Cleveland from NYC. I was really impressed with everything about this restuarant. I went with two of my coworkers.

One had the scallops, the other had the haddok, and I opted for the soup (corn chili something), the bacon app, and the side of potatoes. It was more than I could finish. Everyone enjoyed their meal.

The atmosphere is great. Great date spot, can easily hear the people you are with and the vibe is awesome. They have an excellent wine, beer and cocktail selection. I would definately come back again if I was in town.

The soup was seasoned perfectly, it had a spike to it but not to much. The appitizer (which is terrible for you) was amazing. Cooked perfectly and had an amazing glaze on it. The side of potates beats your average french fry and I was pleasently surprised. They were crispy and the onion garnish was wonderful.

Great place to check out if you want a nice night out!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there yesterday. We were seated promptly, and the staff was very good. 

The beef cheek pierogi were well prepared but a JUST a tad salty. The hangar steak was tender, flavorful and perfectly prepared.  

Now to the halibut - sub par. It was not the freshest, not perfectly white, and was thin.  I've had halibut in Alaska which was perfectly fresh and very white. The halibut at Lola could not compare. Even with the accompanying broth, it seemed dry.

Desserts were very good - especially the maple bacon ice cream served as part of the \"6 am\"."}
{"text":"I had a nice lunch after the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame.  The food was great but at a bit of a premium price.  Still, I would not hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"I figured by the time I got here, Michael Symon had stretched his empire a bit too far.  I must say, though, I was impressed with the food. 

I began things with the seared pork belly. Seriously, what meal doesn't go well when it starts with pig fat?  A very creative preperation with crispy pigs ears included. 

For my main course, I went with the hanger steak.  It was a great preparation and served with Lola fries.  Way too many fries (read: enough for the table) but they were crispy and paired with fresh rosemary for a superb flavoring.

The service was a bit odd.  They have a \"swarm method\" where multiple people are covering.  I was asked multiple times about my drink order which was a bit annoying."}
{"text":"The one star is specifically for the two hostesses I encountered tonight.  My friend and I arrived at 5pm with no reservations.  She said that was fine and we would be seated shortly, \"just have a seat at the bar and have a drink\".  We decided we didn't want drinks at the bar, so we stood about 5 feet away from the hostess desk and patiently waiting to be seated.

All the tables were empty...but we thought, perhaps the dining room didn't open until 5, and it was 5:02 when we started waiting. 

About 5 minutes later, a couple walks in, talks to the hostess, and were seated immediately.  Yep, we watched them as they all passed us to get to their tables.  

A couple of minutes later, another couple arrived, talked to the hostess, and were seated immediately.  

I was quite irked...EVERY table was empty when we arrived AND the hostess told  us that it wouldn't be a problem if we didn't have a reservation...so why the completely rude service?

We figured if that was our initial experience at Lola, we'd rather spend our money elsewhere at a place that respects it's customers (with reservations or not.)

We left."}
{"text":"My wife and I are not impressed. Our son and daughter in law took us here. Overpriced and some staff were pompous assholes. 

We won't ever be back."}
{"text":"After a sea of 5 star ratings, I feel sheepish giving Lola a lowly 4. However, if I think about it too much, I might even lower my rating to a 3.5.... 

I had extremely high expectations for Lola and as usual, this type of hype is often closely tied to less than satisfactory dining experiences. 

My boyfriend and I began the night with the beef cheek pierogi appetizer, which cost a pretty penny and yet produced only 2 pierogies! The wait staff was kind enough to place each pierogi on a separate plates for us and yet this only made the quantity seem more ludicrous. While I understand quality trumps quantity, I have to say Lola flat-lined in both aspects. The pierogis were excessively salty and lacked memorability. 

My boyfriend ordered the cod for dinner which he felt was cooked well for a fish that often is very bland. I ordered the calves heart, which had a very interesting texture and yet once again lacked flavor memorability. I also felt that the mustard seeds were overpowering and did not make up for the fact that the calves heart itself was poorly flavored. The brussel sprouts were the saving grace on the plate. Michael Symon sure does brussel sprouts right, both at Lola and Lolita. Overall, I felt extraordinarily apathetic towards the entire meal. 

My rating bumped up to a 4 only because the drink selection was superb. We had Cocchi Americano, which is an apertif that has apparently become very popular (I was unaware). It was citrus-y and bitter, yet sweet and fresh all at the same time. It was a great drink and I was happy to see it on the list. 

Overall, I had a sub-par experience at Lola and am saddened by this since I simply adore Lolita. The staff was extraordinarily courteous and the service was just outstanding, however the food was memorable only for its lack of memorability. I might consider returning to try some of the other dishes that have garnered good reviews such as the bone marrow, but I think I'll make the rounds on other Cleveland restaurants first."}
{"text":"For my birthday my friend and I sat at the chefs table where you can see the chefs cook. We had the charcuterie board, mussels, pork chop, side of mushrooms and two desserts. The charcuterie board was one so delicious, each meat so different from the other. The pork chop had the perfect amount of fat on it for an explosion of flavor! The side of mushrooms were superb. The desserts were absolutely out of this world. One was the sticky 6 am special and the sticky toffee pudding! The bacon Ice cream is to die for as well as the poached pears. So delicious will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for business dinner a few months ago while in Cleveland.  Located in a cute, nice area.  Service was excellent and I was in love with the atmosphere.  We shared a bottle of Moscato Wine with the braised berkshire bacon, it was very delicious.  I had the beef hanger steak for dinner and loved every bite of it.  Very tender, yet juicy.  If i ever go back I will make sure to come here again.  And you have to get dessert !  I had the sweet corn pudding, one of the best desserts I've ever had in my
life."}
{"text":"I'd rate this a five star except I don't ever want to find the best restaurant as that would end the search.  We hit it on a Cavaliers game night so it was busy and loud, until close to game time.  Decor and bar are gorgeous and cocktails are top notch albeit expensive.  The service was impeccable, and I swear that someone would be there with a hanky if you sneezed!  You always try to figure out what could be better with the food, and this is the first time I could honestly say that I wouldn't change a thing! Smoked pork chop for me and hanger steak for my wife. Both meats were like butter, and I never thought that a chop could have that texture.  The sides were incredible, and both proteins were topped with a killer julienned veggie combo.  Everything was served at the proper temperature including the water.  It's a winner!"}
{"text":"Beef cheek pierogi with a glass of Bordeaux.
Calves heart & spinach with a glass of Nebbiolo.
Chocolate peanut crunch with a glass of Beaujolais.
Lola sidecar.

Service was great, and the food was a value considering the quality.

See!  Not everything in Cleveland sucks."}
{"text":"Yes, we only made the reservation because--come on--Iron Chef Michael Symon has a restaurant and it's within a two hour drive and we could make a night out of it, wouldn't you?

Yes, that dish everyone tells you to get is also what you should probably get. Only as an appetizer, though. Split it, it's okay, you'll need the room to try something else.

Yes, you should get some meat. And a side of mushrooms. Unless you want something else--every dish at Lola is a combination of flavors both new and nostalgic; what might seem perplexing at first quickly settles in to become your new favorite bite, with even the simplest additions complementing the heavier flavors with a delicacy you can't replicate at home. Or across the street.

The service is smart. The sommelier, Manuel, is valuable.

Yes, you should get dessert."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a couple years. Aside from business lunches and dinners, I've never dined here on my own dime, which I think is a better type of dinning experience. If your visiting Cleveland, Lola is fine dining must.

Everything about this place is amazing- atmosphere, design aesthetic of the space, delicious food prepared to perfection, the impeccable service you will receive, and an extremely knowledge staff.

There is no vegan entree option, a disappointment for some, but if you know this Iron Chef you should expect it."}
{"text":"My sister and brother-in-law gave me a giftcard to Lola after finding out I was moving to Cleveland, and I must say that it was one of the most excellent meals I've had in a long time.  I had the foia gras appetizer and venison, which were both top-notch.  The ipad-based drink menu was useless- after poking at it trying to figure out how to order a martini, I resorted to the traditional method of asking our server.  The service, btw, was perfect.  He was professional, knowledgeable and courteous without being intrusive."}
{"text":"Coming back to Cleveland after many years, I was looking forward to eating in one of the top-rated restaurants.  Sadly, the whole experience disappointed.  The place is showing its age in the dining room and restrooms, the open kitchen emits way too much smoke at certain moments. The menu is interesting, but not well-executed.  The pirogies were delicious but the hanger steak was ok, and the scallops were just passable (a little fishy smelling).  The desserts were deconstructed nothings.  

The service is sadly mediocre.  I asked for recommendations on the short wine list (I have a feeling that for whatever reason they did not show me the whole wine list). The person who came to give advice was not helpful.  He spoke in generalities that suggested he did not know the wines.  

Unless I hear of a major overhaul, I will not put this on my list for my next visit to Cleveland."}
{"text":"I had lunch here the other day when I was in Cleveland for business. I have been to Roast in Detroit several times and loved it so I was excited to check out Michael Symon's first restaurant. 

I started with the Greek Chopped Salad. It was tasty. My one complaint about the salad was that it had WAY too many olives. If you love olives (I don't) that's probably a good thing. 

For lunch I had the Spiced Beef Brisket sandwich. It was a good choice. The cumin greek yogurt was a nice touch and the brisket was very flavorful. I also enjoyed the flatbread it was on. The sandwich was served with thin-cut fries that were awesome! Overall a very enjoyable lunch!"}
{"text":"Oh. My Goodness.  This was good. This was VERY good!  When I found that I was going to Cleveland I knew I had to come here.  I was not disappointed!  As one should do in this sort of place I left myself in the hands of my capable server,  I started off with the beef cheek pierogi  Perfectly braised beef... yum!.  I then took a break with a darn good martinez.  Not as good as the one my beloved makes...but not bad at all!  They had to look it up!  Missed the cherries, but when I pointed it out house-brandied ones showed up in short order.  For my main I had the flank steak.  It was cooked perfectly rare-medium-rare and was one of the BEST steak I have ever had.  Got to say it... Michael Symon has got one heck of a good place!

My server was just the right level of attentive.  I had a great conversation with Nolan, the manager.  All in all, one of the finest meals I've had.  It was, with tip (and some good wine!), a bit over $100.  That's the right price for what I had."}
{"text":"To be honest I haven't been since it was located in Tremont, but back then the food was amazing. I was in middle school when we'd go, and I wasn't very adventurous back then when it came to food, which is why it was awesome that they had the mac and cheese on the menu, which was Incredible. Obviously it's probably been getting a lot of hype from the Iron Chef stuff, and peoples expectations are probably getting blown out of proportion, but I still love Lola."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last week and everything was top notch. Our server was very attentive and engaged with every table. 
We had beef cheek pierogi to start - melt in your mouth awesomeness. They look small but are so rich I took the tiniest bites. Oh. My. Yum. 
I had the smoked chop, friend had the hangar steak. Every bite of food was exploding with flavor and portions were pretty big. The chip was out of this world and the polenta it was plated with was as rich as IceCream. 
We had to do desert. We shared brioche French toast with candied bacon, apples, Carmel and maple bacon IceCream. Again. Couldn't finish it. So rich. Delicious!
Drinks are great, too. The drink menu is presented on an iPad. Wine selection is good, too."}
{"text":"There was nothing particularly wrong with my visit to the Iron Chef's restaurant. Everything was fine for the most part... the waitress forgot my glass of wine... my friends pasta dish was lukewarm... but in general it was a nice night out. The problem is that I want more from a superstar chef. I want a more creative menu. Deep frying the bone marrow is not celebrating the ingredient. The only adventurous dish on the menu was the Calves Heart. It was okay but the gravy it was served in was underwhelming. 

The bottom line is this... if I didn't know... or care about... who the chef was, and if dinner was fifty dollars instead of one hundred dollars I would be raving about this place. Chef's in this league are challenged to raise the bar, and with Lola, Michael Symon doesn't."}
{"text":"Lovely decor and a very intimate environment. Definitely different to the other restaurants I've been to on Cleveland. The desserts are to die for and attention to detail in presentation is lovely. Creme brûlée and the Nutella roll were scrumptious- see pics below"}
{"text":"Great food and great location. Lola is a trendy spot, but trendy in a way that still feels comfortable and not overdone. I had the popular and delicious Beef Cheek Pierogis to start and followed those up with the Smoked Pork Chop. My dining companions had the beet salad, oysters, halibut, and duck, and we finished off the meal with Chocolate P.B. Banana dessert. I loved the pierogi and my pork chop was a large and tasty portion. I tried a bite of the duck that came with rye spaetzle, cabbage, mushrooms, caraway, and currants and I think that might have been my favorite entree of the night. Our server claimed that our dessert was good for sharing, but I beg to disagree. We still enjoyed it though, and it was just enough to give us each a sweet bite to end the dinner on."}
{"text":"BEST bone marrow we've ever had! It doesn't come in the bone like normal... they take it out of the bone and lightly fry it first ... AMAZING!!! The smoked blue cheese, pickled onions, fresh parsley, sea salt and bacon jam make it easy to create whatever little bite you want! 

BEST lamb shank I've ever had! It LITERALLY fell off the bone. It was SOOO tender, it was hard for me to transfer a piece to my boyfriends plate without it falling off my fork... IT WAS HEAVEN!!"}
{"text":"I just had a great little pit stop at Lola's on Friday for a late happy hour.  3 of us, one from India, ponied up to the bar which was surprisingly empty at 7ish, and ordered drinks along with some appetizers.

First off the bar area uses IPad's for bar menus.  What a cool, but expensive, concept.  It really added some flare in a 'never before' kind of way.  I heard everyone talking about it as they came in to have a drink before dinner.  Even the ladies next to me were just loving it.

Drinks were strong, exactly the way I wanted it.  The wine list is fantastic.  I always go with the same wine that the Lola bartender recommended from the first time ever visiting this restaurant.  Its a McManis Cabernet, and its smooth, fruity, with a wonderful finish.  I buy 2 or more bottles every time I go to Whole Foods or World Market.  Lola's also have a decent beer selection but tonight it was liquor and wine for us.

Food:  We decided to get 4 appetizers and share.  All were delicious and I would go back for more in an instant.  I'll just leave it at that and list what we had.  Beef Cheek Pierogis, Beet and Apple Salad, Pork Belly and Pig Ear, Quail, and of course a side of Lola Fries.  Great job chef's at Michael Symon's Lola!!

The service here is exactly what you would expect at a upscale restaurant.

In the future, DO NOT expect this place to be dead on a Friday at 7, I think it was a fluke cause within 20 minutes, the place was 3-4 deep at the bar.  We just got lucky.  Do yourself a favor, make a reservation or go really early if you want to sit at the bar.  Also plan on being there for a while, space out your appetizers, and just enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Lola lives up to the hype. You've probably heard it is one of if not the best restaurant in Cleveland. It is. 

I've only been once but I am confident that I didn't just catch them on a good night. We went at kind of a random time since it was our anniversary -  a Wednesday night kind of early I think. The restaurant was actually reasonably full considering the day and time which was nice. Hate being one of only a couple full tables. 

Wine list:  Solid. Good range of prices and our waiter helped us select an excellent bottle within our price range. 

Appetizer - we got a charcuterie/cheese board. Above average and a good quantity of food. 

The mains: Sean had swordfish which I had never tried but it is a white fish with a firm steak-like texture. It was excellent and something very different. I had the halibut which just sounded good to me - although not the sexiest fish on the menu. It was probably the best fish I have ever eaten. The fish was perfectly done and was served with some sort of lemon reduction which was just the right amount of tangy. My mouth is watering just thinking about it although this was several months back.

Lola is an excellent restaurant for a special occasion. You won't be let down if you're looking to have a great meal with someone special or looking to wow some guests."}
{"text":"The wait staff made sure our water glasses were always filled. Our waiter made sure our wine glasses were always full. Even our napkins were folded for us when we got up from the table. Not to mention the food was incredible. The lamb shank melted in your mouth. This establishment clearly pays attention to the details. Bravo."}
{"text":"Hands down for the best Manhattan drink I have ever had. The food was awesome as well, would definitely come back if I visit cleveland."}
{"text":"5 for service
5 for presentation of food
5 for taste
5 for value for price
5 for ambience

Stayed at hotel down the street on business. Went w 3 others I work with from all over the country. I started w beets salad and had the pork chop. Both had great presentation and quantity. Had a glass of cab. $68 total for a dinner that in NYC would have been easily $140 and in Dallas at least $110. Ambiance and decor was modern chic. Amazing meal really. All guests at my table were very impressed. I'll go back.... in fact I can't wait to get back to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant!  It is clearly a pace for meat lovers, but I had seafood with sausage and beans in a truly amazing broth. The price is very reasonable for such fresh and exciting food.  Tables are crowed a bit close together, but I don't go out to eat for privacy so I didn't mind. Server was well trained and attentive. Worth a drive to go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"AVOID!! Horrible staff!! I took my fiance there 2/15, who has Narcolepsy, and was having an episode which is embarrassing enough for her BTW. Then, after I ordered a drink the waitress takes the drink menu away and says to my fiance \"Surely YOU won't be needing this.\" ?!!?!!! REALLY? No questions asked whatsoever. Is this how a prestigious establishment handles a DISABILITY!! Offer coffee, ask if you are going to need a cab, or absolutely anything else first! Shame on \"LOLA\" and their entire staff for letting this happen. (App made me put one star. I would have put negative stars if I could.)"}
{"text":"Fantastic.  I am from D.C. and we can be a little \"extra...\" the food was fantastic, the table outside was perfect, we are very happy."}
{"text":"4 stars because of the wine list. The menu lacks creativity (or perhaps this is where everyone rips off from, but nevertheless). The items on the menu are items you can find elsewhere. If you must eat here to enjoy the Michael Symon vibe, sit at the chefs table where you can watch your food being made. Always get dessert."}
{"text":"My son attends Case Western. We have dined at Lola. It is dining, not  \"eating\".  This place makes new flavors. I don't know how else to describe it.  If you ever see pumpkin pie & foie gras appetizer, jump on it.

The bar made the best martini I've ever had and I drink them everywhere I go.  I can't afford to eat at a place like this too often. So, when I do, I'm a little fussy.  Its worth the cost.  BTW, try the pinot \"Lulu\" (or maybe \"Lula\"), very nice."}
{"text":"Stopped in with friends at Lola's and was to be seated right away at a table but we noticed the chef's bar at the kitchen and asked if we could sit there. They said yes as soon as the other people left which shouldn't be to long. So we sat at the bar and had a delightful cocktail while we waited.  Boy oh boy am I glad waited???!!!!!.  

The chef's table is right up close to the kitchen and is lighted onyx just like the bar. Has a romantic vibe but also cool with friends. The line cooks give you samples of things that look yummy that you didn't order.  We shared a few things.  The cheek meat tacos were great but the pork shank it to die for. Huge portion so share if you can. The veggies are delightful and the desserts were great.  

I totally recommend Lola to anyone with discriminating taste and a light wallet. Considering the quality of the meal it wasn't as pricey as it could have been."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to coming here & I wasn't really disappointed,  but my husband was. We tried the bone marrow & it was good, but too much for two people.  We also tried the beef cheek perogi, not my favorite thing.  My husband ordered the lamb shank & on top of the bone marrow, he was kind of sick. I got the hanger steak & mine was much better than his. I'm glad I came, but not sure I would order the same things."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  Soooo, for the first time every I tried pig ears.  If you are ever going to try pig ears.  This is the place to do it.  Everything was excellent.  The wine was fantastic also."}
{"text":"This is my go-to restaurant when I need to plan a fancy \"date night\". It's located in the already gorgeous E. 4th St, so that already sets the bar high. The atmosphere is nice, dim lighting like you'd find at any gourmet place, and the waitstaff are very friendly. Definitely a bit more on expensive side but once the food arrives you won't be disappointed. Menu is smaller but each choice is a winner, the hanger steak and the duck breast are definitely two standouts in my opinion. And for dessert the 6am special: brioche French toast with maple bacon ice cream, AMAZING! The cocktails are strong and decently prices, try the wavelength 500 if you like tequila. And the our waitress even brought us a special plate of cupcakes congratulating my boyfriend and I on our anniversary, which was a really personal and lovely touch!"}
{"text":"There is potential for 5 stars, but the overall experience fell \"just a bit outside.\"

Starting with the good:
The food.  We ordered beef cheek pierogi, Bibb salad, pork chop, duck, roasted potatoes, egg nog creme brûlée, and figgy pudding. The pierogi was good, but I've grown up eating good pierogi and I make my own so it wasn't Earth shattering for me. High marks for the salad. It had the right amount of dressing and the pickled red onion with pancetta were spot on. The pork chop was perhaps the best chop I've eaten, and the chiles were a perfect balance of flavor. The duck was quite nice also, and whole cranberries were a nice touch. Roasted potatoes were a good side to accompany either entree. The brûlée was good but the figgy pudding was better. It had a caramel sauce and sour cream ice cream which were both nice. There was also this piece of toffee like substance atop the dessert that was good initially but carried a dish soapy aftertaste. I tried it with each component on the plate and each time it simply overpowered in an unpleasant way. I didn't get it, it added nothing - A minor miss that i just decided to leave alone while enjoying the rest of dessert. So overall a solid meal. Iron Chef for a reason I'd say. 

Now the not so great...  Our table for 2 was right by the bar.  I don't mind being near the bar in fact this bar was really nice. However our table was right next to where the servers would pick up drinks, wait for drinks to pick up, and buff wine glasses. Too trafficky and not very private. Suggest not having a table there or having some sort of divider - I get it that they're going for the open theme but for me at that particular table it was distracting. 

Then the iPad drink menu. Ironically as I write this on my iPad I found the drink menu to be gimmicky and no value added. First the atmosphere is very dimly lit, which I don't mind a bit. But then I have to order my drink on this exceedingly bright device that loads slower than I can turn pages on a conventional menu. This makes it hard to transition to the dinner menu, written on papyrus, as my eyes adjust back to the dim setting. What does the iPad do/improve upon anyway?  If it was a way to signal the expediter that I was ready for the next course or some twisted integration of social networking then I'd at least applaud the effort but the way they use it is akin to using your Wii to browse the web. Then when the server comes back and says \"have we decided?\"  Am I supposed to verbally give my drink order or simply (and impersonally) hand over the device? Just doesn't make any sense. The drink app also runs out of real estate so I had to ask the server if the last ingredient on one of the drinks was in fact blood orange and not just blood.  Drinks also lack description unlike B Spot whose drink menu makes you want to try it all. Finally switching back to the paper menu for food, I just don't get why we couldn't do paper all along. 

Next, the water guy. I could not get two sips in before the doting water guy would be refilling my glass. Now there's service and there's over the top. He was the latter. Had he been the beer guy I'd have walked out of there drunk as a skunk having no idea how much I actually consumed. Needless to say halfway home my bladder was cursing the water guy. 

Last, I don't get why people are raving about the bread service. It's just bread. I'm no Boudin but I bake better bread and quite frankly I couldn't care less if the bread was any good or not. 

Overall great food but the experience could've been better."}
{"text":"This place speaks for itself with reviews and coming through.  It's amazing from staff and servers to decor to cleanliness to drinks and most importantly the food.  Everything was amazing but this venison special they had was beyond amazing. Def a pricey night but worth it and highly recommend going here!"}
{"text":"Very beautiful place. Located on the E4th. Great location. They got valet parking in the beginning of the street. Very nice steaks"}
{"text":"Amazing meal thanks to my bartender, David.  He is extremely professional and knows the menu very well. I recommend trying the \"fish and chips\". It's amazing.. everything here is amazing. I love it and will be visiting Lola every trip back to Cleveland."}
{"text":"I couldn't be more excited to write my 250th yelp review for Lola! That being said, we came here last night and I am already recommending this restaurant to everyone we talk to! My biggest tip is to call a few months ahead and book the chefs table. There are 6 seats available, we called a month ahead and got two seats for 9:30pm. The chefs table is truly a treat and should be saved for a special occasion. You get to see all the action: the cooking and the plating all front row!

You are greeted with an iPad specifically for drinks! This is such an innovative touch, tap on the drink or bottle of wine to learn more about it! He started with a head hunter and then we split a bottle of wine. 

We started with the beef cheek pierogi, I was a little skeptical because I wasn't sure it would live up to the hype, well it did! I would definitely order this, it is the perfect beginning to your culinary adventure! 

I went with the hanger steak and subbed roasted cauliflower instead of the Lola fries. The hanger steak was cooked perfectly and I wish I could put the pickle sauce over everything. My SO ordered the smoked pork chop and it cut like a filet! The polenta, bbq onions, and the smokey flavor paired perfectly together. Pork isn't my go to meat but I would probably order this next time! The best part was seeing your dish being made from start to finish,  you can truly see how much work and precision goes into your meal!

We ended our fabulous meal with the Black Forest dessert. I was apprehensive when it arrived because it was very deconstructed, but it was the perfect rich ending to our meal!

Since the food was flawless why only 4 stars? Well I read a lot about the great service in reviews and our server was only subpar. She never introduced herself, wasn't overly friendly, and seems really rushed. Sure this did not damper our dining experience, but I expected a little better service!

I cannot WAIT to return to the chefs table!"}
{"text":"Second visit, just as good as the first. Had oysters and beef cheek pierogies asmapps to share. The pierogies were flavorful, great with a horseradish sauce. Entree was pork chop and duck magret. I understand why the chop is the house special. Flavorful, smoky polenta, just beautiful. Had to have dessert: 6 am special  and pistachio ice cream macaroon sandwich, both great, but the 6 am will get every time. 

Service was impeccable, ask for Amanda"}
{"text":"RUSHED!  Such a shame.  Had two sips of my martini and dinner arrived as we were perusing the wine list.  Hadn't even made a selection.  Even our server said she was surprised it came so fast.  The food was very good but I would suggest not ordering your entrée until you've almost finished your cocktail.  Or go to this restaurant when you have plans later in the evening.  You won't be late."}
{"text":"Pork belly and pork cheeks are not high on my list of desired foods. Cleveland seems desperate for a gourmet restaurant, but having lived in Dallas & NYC I've seen much better! I find the presentation is great, but taste just so so. It's dark inside, and the ambiance nothing special. Classic case of overrated for 'celebrity' chef. Lots of other options and the service was average at best. Can't refill drinks? No dessert offered? Um, they know at least good service at Olive Garden! Sorry, I'd say a drive by."}
{"text":"Went here for Cleveland Restaurant Week and a late Valentine's date. The food and service is amazing!!!!!

I expected smaller portions for restaurant week, but I was definitely the right kind of \"food-coma\" full and had left overs. My date and I shared the Raw Cruciferous and Gem Lettuce salads. I recommend the Gem Lettuce of the two. We each had the Beef Hanger Steak and the fries that came with it was plentiful and delicious. The steak was cooked to perfection. For dessert, I highly recommend the Sticky Toffee Pudding. It was breathtaking!

Service was good - waiter/waitress didn't bother us too much, and always made sure our waters were filled."}
{"text":"Slow bar. 

Slow waitstaff.

Cold food. 

This is a flagship? Funny. 

Michael Symon needs to get his ship upright.  This eatery is absolute garbage. The only positive was a solid wine list.  If you're wanting a great meal. I highly recommend looking elsewhere.

In a major city, this place would close in months."}
{"text":"A friend took us here to celebrate our recent wedding.  Reservations were made and we were seated immediately.  The restaurant is very modern and classy.  Service was superlative.  We had the scallop ceviche and the beef cheek perogies.  Both were excellent.  The lamb entree was perfectly cooked and flavors seem pretty traditional. The hanger steak was also perfectly cooked and came with enough rosemary fries (delicious) to share with the whole table.  Pricing was high but not unexpected.  A very good dining experience overall."}
{"text":"It was NOT an expectable experience . To expensive, menu was \"criptic\" at best, and I left HUNGRY !!!!!!!!'"}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally be going to Michael Symon's Lola in Downtown Cleveland.  It did not disappoint.  A charming street that doesn't resemble much else in the metro area (this is not a bad thing) houses Symon's Lola location.

Inside it's stylish and warm. Beautiful wall of wine encased in glass behind the bar. Very promising first impression.

Quickly seated, the waiter presents not an enormous menu but most anything you can (and can't) imagine seems to be represented beautifully. If you're a daring diner this menu is not wasted on you. Even the less daring will find comfort in simplicity.  There is a bar type chefs table encases part of the kitchen. Step on up dinner for one or two. You get the best seat in the house.

Crispy bone marrow? really? Bring it on. Add a side of raw petite oysters and it's cocktail hour.  Out came long \"fingers\" of crisped bone marrow with assorted accoutrement. Lemon, flake sea salt, hand picked flat leaf parsley, caramelized shallots. Spread the marrow over crostini and let it melt in your mouth with or without accompaniment. It's all good. Don't overlook the cocktail menu even if you have an old standby. Get out of your rut and taste the creation of a mixmaster. You won't be disappointed.

The wine list is present on iPad type devices which is novel certainly but easy to keep up to date and certainly of this decade. Old school offal on a menu with such a modern wine list? oh yes. Everything old is new again. 

Dinner is equal divine. A perfectly cooked excellent quality ribeye. It is adorned with preserved lemon and smoked garlic marrow butter. How many things are right on this plate? Let me count the ways.

Menu changes with the season so locals won't fear being bored then again you may miss the last great thing you had there. But the next great thing could be better.

If only I lived closer I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"Amazing place downtown.  The 6AM special is great, french toast, maple bacon ice cream and apples...  Who can beat that?  The bar had a great feel to it and looks cool all lit up at night.  I was not expecting to find something like this in Cleveland.  Very impressed!"}
{"text":"This is exactly what you might expect from Michael Symon- unique, tasty dishes, perfectly presented, in a lovely warm atmosphere.  Perfect for a date night, special occasion, business dinner, etc... The only downside, was the hubs wasn't as huge of a fan- the more old-school foodies, that prefer more beef options, won't have as much to chose from. Even if there is only one thing on this menu that you can find to like (picky eaters out there)---you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Linda K 
Lola  was amazing ambiance for our 30th Anniversary Dinner.I had the burrata and stone fruit with Pork Shank as an entree. the Portk fell off the bone ...so tender. My hubby had Skirt seak with hollendaise cooked to.perfection. the waitress was informative without being a nuissance and even brought us a Happy 30th treat in the end. Bravo Lola!"}
{"text":"Iron chef Michael Simon lives up to
His title!!! Wonderful meal for a special occasion m! Had the wave 400 to drink, the bone marrow app which was amazing, and shared the Muscovy duck and scallops. Would definitely go back in the future!"}
{"text":"1st time we were ever disappointed in a DiRonna rated restaurant !! Hanger steak which is their signature dish on their menu for umpteen years was gamey & my hubby said tasteless ! it was awful and we sent it back.  Does say enough ?!"}
{"text":"We all know why we come here - it's the closest any of us will get to Kitchen Stadium.  And it doesn't disappoint.  The food was gooooooood. Coupled with the chic environment and cool atmosphere - it was easy to forget that I wasn't back home in LA. I have to be honest - I liked every dish we ordered.  Here are some of the items that I recommend you try:

Appetizers:  
Sweetbreads, Pork Belly, Beef Cheek Pierogi.   You can't go wrong with any of these.  The sweetbreads were my favorite, but you won't go wrong with any of them.  Each appetizer is enough to feed two people (without stuffing them).

Main dishes:  
Pork chops with cheesy polenta and bbq onions and sauce. Holy cow - was this good.  The pork chops were perfectly cooked, served over a bed of cheesy polenta and drizzled with a bbq sauce and bbq onions. 

Wild boar ragu. Or, as my husband called it, comfort food in a bowl.  You know how rainy weather makes you want to curl up on the couch with a bowl of soup?  This dish encapsulates that feeling."}
{"text":"I went to Roast (Symon's restaurant in Detroit) and almost never returned to a Symon restaurant because of that experience, but i kept our reservation and thankfully i did. If Roast was one of the worst experiences i've had LOLA was one of the best! Great great staff that is extremely accommodating and professional. Our server knew the menu well and was best in class. The drinks were stellar and the food was excellent and memorable. 

Beef Cheek Pierogies- Wild mushrooms and horseradish creme fresh. These were made perfectly! Delicious sauce. Great dough. Beef cheek meat was excellently flavored and tender. Highly recommended!

Shrimp- Favas, mint, lemon and curry. Perfectly prepared. Not over-cooked. Great flavor. Huge in size. Recommended.

Crudo- Celery, fennel, orange, mint and chilies. It was albacore this evening. It was one of the best crudos i have had outside of great sushi joints. Flavors melded super well and the albacore was fresh and melted like butter. Highly recommended!

Calves Heart- Brussels sprouts, mustard seeds and salsa verde. This was a first for me, but i am a foodie and adventurous. The calves heart was excellent. It was so tender. I can't wait to try it elsewhere to compare, but in the meantime i would order it at Lola again without hesitation. Highly recommended!

Roasted Corn, Pancetta and Chanterelle Mushrooms- Hands down the second best corn i've ever tasted in my life! Highly recommended!

Chocolate P.B. Banana- Peanut butter mousse, almond sponge, roasted banana ice cream, crispy rice and malt caramel. One of the best desserts i've ever tasted and i am not even a chocolate fan. Highly recommended!

The 6 a.m. Special- Brioche French toast, maple-bacon ice cream and caramelized apple. I don't even know where to begin, but WOW. This is just to die for. Highly recommended!

I am so thankful that we kept our reservations here and this is a true showing of the magic that Symon can deliver. It's a MUST if in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Being a food network junkie i had to check out Michael Symone's restaurant while I was in town for cleveland.  Dinner was amazing.  I had a steak, which was tender and perfectly cooked.  I also ordered the 6am special for dinner which was the sweetest, most delicious french toast with maple bacon ice cream.  Bacon definitely makes everything better, even ice cream.  The wine selection was great, and you order your wine off an iPad, which was a bit much.  The staff was all attentive and welcoming."}
{"text":"If you are unsure of what to order, get the Braised Lamb Shank! The meat just melted off the bone and my date ate more of my entree rather than his steak. 

The ambience was a bit intriguing. I assumed this was a higher end restaurant (and the interior ascribed to that thought), but the clientele were a bit too boisterous and loud. Fun for people watching, but when you have a table of eighteen year olds sitting behind you, it can be a little much. 

I won't lie, I did not like the use of iPads to choose what drinks to order. They had an extensive wine list, which we ordered from, but I would have liked the knowledge of a true sommelier to pair a wine with our meal, rather than reading a generic description of what the wine tastes like. Thankfully I read/drink enough wine on my own, that I was able to choose a 2012 Spanish Priorat that paired well with both of our dishes. But it would be good if they trained the staff in basic knowledge at least."}
{"text":"Great drinks; and atmosphere.  Had a lot of fun can't wait to go back.  The bartender was very friendly and pointed out other local places to check out.  The staff could not have been any nicer.  The desserts were unbelievable!!"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner and was not disappointed. We started with the beef cheek pierogi which was awesome just like everyone else said...  I had the lamb and my boyfriend had the ribeye. His ribeye had what we like to call \"fat candy\". You know, when a steak is seared so perfect that the fat almost crystallizes and every little bite of it is like candy?  Yeah. That's fat candy. Nothing is better than hot, crispy, and perfectly seared steak with marbled fat candy through it. 
My lamb was also delicious beyond delicious. It was so tender it really actually did \"melt in your mouth\". It didn't even feel like meat in your mouth because it was so tender and perfectly cooked it made you wonder how the hell they cooked it like that. 
It was like velvet. 
Like velvety, moist, cooked to perfection, I hope this never ends, lamb. Amazing. Service was perfect, ambiance was romantic. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"In town for a wedding and decided on Lola last minute. Recommend the Gunslinger to start and sturgeon for entree. Wife had the scallops and everything was delish!"}
{"text":"Delicious dinner in the heart of Cleveland.  Having heard that this was a must on our Cleveland tour - we made reservations well in advance for a Friday dinner.  The staff could not have been nicer, and more attentive.  We had my nephew with us, who was quite a handful but they never made us feel uncomfortable - even preparing him a side of raw vegetables.  The food was delicious - and I would definitely recommend to anyone in Cleveland if they are looking for a good meal!"}
{"text":"Average food, way too small of portions for the price. The crab cakes are good though."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place but unfortunately it was almost inedible. It's been a while back now that I went but still remember the experience. I got the Schnitzel and it was WAY to salty. I love salt, more than the average person but this was soo salty It just simply could not be eaten. I thought maybe after it cooled down and I took it home and tried again it might be doable but it twas not. Pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"small portions, food was good but woke up hungry in the morning.  service was ok as well- didn't think this place was too astounding, had high expectations walking in."}
{"text":"Michael Symon is an evil genius. Never before have I been presented with such an artful array of delicious animal fat. I took my girlfriend to Lola for a weekday lunch. Amidst the sandwich-chomping business lunch yuppie crowd, we went crazy.

We started with the beef cheek pierogi. Tender, chewy starchy seared pastry filled with wonderfully braised meat, with a subtle, creamy horseradish sauce. I'd eat 10, but we settled for an order of 2.

We'll have to go back for dinner so we can try the root vegetable salad. Instead we got a butter lettuce salad with pancetta and radishes. Nice and unusual with the peppery fatty pancetta.

And the main event: I had the duck confit over creamed leeks. Beyond description. The duck was fork-tender. The bones just fell out, leaving behind a perfectly seared, fatty, fragrant, savory piece of dark meat, over a rich blue cheese and leek sauce. Perfect dish.

Smoked brisket sandwich was also really impressive. The beef was tender and smoky, and sliced thin and served with rosemary fries and homemade ketchup.

Yum.

And we ate for under 50 bucks!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great serving size, fantastic ambience. Can't ask for much more in a restaurant. This place nails the restaurant essentials and accompanies it with a solid menu."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! This is a great restaurant! I was starting to get discouraged going to celebrity chef's restaurants. But, Michael Symon restored my faith! We came here for my birthday dinner. For apps, we ordered Beef Cheeks Pierogi and the Maine Lobster. They were both delicious and no clear cut winner. For entrees, daughter ordered the Roast Chicken. She LOVED it. Hubs ordered the Lamb Heart. It was claimed to be medium rare. He loved it and thinking of getting it rare next time. I think it's tasty but no way am I getting it rare! I ordered the Scallops and it was out of this world. It was nice and soft! For dessert, we shared the 6 AM Special. OMG! Again, it was fantabulous! I had a great time watching the chefs cook. The open kitchen concept is great! I was sad to realize dinner was over and we had to leave. Service was friendly well. Already planning my next meal there soon! Love you guys!"}
{"text":"Found Lola's on a map and then noticed it was a Michael Symon restaurant. Made a reservation and was seated immediately when I got there and outside as requested. Had the Crudo appetizer, Sushi grade tuna - awesome. Then based on other reviews, the hanger steak. Prepared to medium rare as requested and as tender as any filet mignon. Liz, my waitress was perfect, even though I was a single I was not rushed and was well served. Natalie was also attentive and an asset to the staff. Will return next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Had the beef check pierogis, then the pork chop and I was in heaven- ate at the at & the bartender was super nice & friendly.  This place is a must visit"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor. One of the fanciest AND most delicious restaurants in Cleveland. Hands down the most delectable orecchiette I have ever had...flavorful and perfect texture. Oh, also discounted valet parking!"}
{"text":"Lola is one of my favorite restaurants. I will also admit that I have quite a bit of admiration for Michael Symon and all of his restaurants. We recently visited for my husband's birthday. 

I hate anglonotti for dinner and it was absolutely delicious. It had sweet corn and was better than the majority of vegetarian dishes I've had. My husband had pork chops and really like them too.

We ordered desert and then were also pleasantly surprised when they brought my hubby a happy birthday plate with cupcake complete with candle. They also brought us chocolate truffles, which is complimentary with meals. Wow, top notch!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I have been here many times and never disappointed. If you are cash strapped, go in for the lunch menu. It is is the best secret bargain in the city.  Bone-in ribeye on their dinner menu is amazing! Staff is great - attentive and professional. Recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to enjoy a wonderful evening here on a Friday evening.  Only one tip - this area gets really busy from a traffic and parking perspective on game nights, so double check before scheduling and driving down.  My date was waylaid on the way in with closed streets and traffic and I spent way to long waiting to get out of the parking garage as we left the restaurant the same time the game ended.  It's certainly not under Lola's control, so no minus on their side.  Just keep that in mind.

The  service here was absolutely top notch.  Every one from the hostesses to the bartenders to our servers had their A game on the night we were there.  I couldn't find something to pick at even if you asked me to.

The atmosphere was equally top notch.  We had a table for two close to the open kitchen (a plus for me) and the noise level was right about where I like it.  I'm not a fan of restaurants that are so quiet that everyone around you can hear your conversation, nor am I a fan of those that are so loud that you have to strain to hear or ask the other person to repeat themselves several times during the evening.  Lola's was 'just right'.

The food was equally fantastic.  I had the oysters as an appetizer and they were about as good as it gets. Incredibly fresh and flavorful with a kiss of the ocean.  YUM!

We both has the Wild Salmon with fava beans, baby tomato, and chanterelle  mushrooms.  We had a side of the wild mushrooms mix as well.  Again, just amazing flavors and spot on presentation.  The wine that the server picked pair perfectly.

Just a spot on night the whole way around!

{"text":"You guys. 

I live in Cleveland, now. 

I don't know why I'm using Yelp like it's my personal blog, but I felt the need to update this news SOMEWHERE, you know?

Anyway, it is fitting that I discuss my move from LA to SF to Cleveland in my review for Lola, because 1) Lolita is one of my favorite books! and 2) I was wined and dined here twice in one day before I moved to Cleveland (the first being lunch with the office I interviewed with and the second being dinner with my boyfriend's mom ahh I'm so old now). 

To be honest, this was a few months ago, so I kind of forgot what I had for lunch, but it was good, probably. The duck somethingsomething I had for dinner, however, was fantastic. The waiter did such a good job selling us on said fantasticism that we all ordered the duck, so I have nothing else to say on that.

But really, why would I need to? Michael Symon seems to be hailed as one of Cleveland's food messiahs, this restaurant was featured on No Reservations, the prices are mostly reasonable and why would you not go?"}
{"text":"Wow!  We loved Lola!  This should really be 4.5.  Service was super and the food was great.  Started out with a new take on the dirty martini - added a bit of Tabasco to it which I wouldn't have thought of myself and it was great.  While the entrees all looked good, nothing super-wowed us so we went with a series of appetizers to create our own \"tasting menu.\"  Our absolute favorites:  the lobster roll and the pork belly. We planned to skip dessert but Amanda, our excellent server, tempted us with the \"6am Special\" - bacon-maple ice cream served over brioche French toast.  Not too shabby! We highly recommend this if you find yourself in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I've had the good fortune to have dined at Lola for years. Before Michael Symon was an Iron Chef and owned a restaurant empire, he was turning out great food at Lola."}
{"text":"Went to Lola last weekend before an art gallery opening with my parents and boyfriend. 

We started with the Crudo, Bone Marrow, & Oysters. Crudo and oysters were both great. So much flavor and presentation was great. The bone marrow's presentation was not what I expected. I expected a nice bone presentation. However, it was deep fried sticks that looked like Motz sicks with a bunch of different sauces to try it with. I was not a fan. 

Entree wise: I had the Lamb Flank ... one word: Amazing. It was so tender - literally fell off the bone. I was absolutely fantastic. My mom had the salmon. She was disappointed. It literally tasted like nothing. Very very bland.  My boyfriend and dad ordered the duck. They both said it was very ok. Nothing to wow your pants off and neither would order it again."}
{"text":"To start with, the only thing that could have possibly downgraded this restaurant is the fact that one Michael Symon was not personally there serving me up food with his beautiful self - because beyond that, everything was A+. 
I went here with my sister, and we started by ordering several apps, including the charcuterie board, pumpkin pie and the beef cheek pierogies, as well as some others that do not appear on the menu currently - and were not the stand outs anyway so I won't discuss them. The charcuterie - everything was so fresh and everything you want from a charcuterie board. Beef cheek pierogies - a must have! They are just so freaking good! I don't even have a good way to describe them other than just great. One other interesting one we had here was this pumpkin pie with foie gras. It also had pickled apples. You really needed to get all the components together for a great bite because just the pie with foie gras alone could be a bit too much of the same soft texture but the apple took it over the top. 
What was hilarious here is that our waiter thought all we were ordering was apps and wasn't super attentive at first. Once he realized we were not messing around and planned on ordering a ton more, because its not everyday you are in an Iron Chefs restaurant, he was all about recommending things and really joined in on our fun. This was not to say he was a bad waiter prior to this, just not as stellar as he became after. 
So our entrees, we each got a different preparation of beef with whatever the seasonal greens and sauces that were being offered. I seemed to like mine a bit more than my sister enjoyed hers, but both entrees were cooked well. I polished mine up in minutes! 
The desserts was a blast. We ordered a ton here too, but standouts were 6 am special and apple pie. The apple pie was delicious - everything apple pie should be and had cinnamon ice cream to boot. The 6 am special was where it was at for me though. A brioche french toast with maple bacon ice cream - yum yum yum!!! Put bacon on anything and I am a happy girl! This dessert can be a bit heavy though, so if you are already feeling overstuffed - maybe stay away from this one or you will need to pull up a blanket and sleep it off!!!"}
{"text":"Yumm was so good had their steak ate so well everyone happy.  Make a reservation for sure"}
{"text":"Where do we begin!  Lola is unbelievable!!  We will never forget our honeymoon dinner here.  Not only were we treated like royalty, but we fought over all the bacon dishes!  We had the tuna crudo as it was the special appetizer, however later all of our friends said we should've gone with the pierogi.  The kitchen is open so it was like watching the food network.  I ordered salmon, she ordered steak, and both were phenomenal.  Sherry was a great dessert wine.  We had cupcakes, and french toast with bacon flavored ice cream.  Amaze!  Five stars, we will be attending more Mike Symon restaurants."}
{"text":"Michael Symon, you SOB! You serve up pig ears? Come on, my dog eats those!! Holy Shit, I love pig ears!!!! Crispy pig ears and pork belly. I have an appointment with my cardiologist next week so fingers crossed. These delicious oink parts are unreal good. The crispy strands of ear and mouth melting pork belly make personal stops to every taste bud in your mouth. I don't know why Kermit didn't have a hankering for Miss Piggy?!? Well, it doesn't end there. Hey, how about some bone marrow since we didn't indulge enough? I don't know what to say about it. The Catholic guilt I am feeling for eating it and wanting more, is killing this altar boy inside! I'll say some Hail Mary's. Time to cleanse the palate with that perfect Kettle One Martini with Blue Cheese Olives! Okay, now on to dinner. I have been here before and got the Scallops which were amazing, but tonight was a night of land carnage. I ordered the famous hanger steak medium rare and I was so surprised at how tender and juicy the steak was. You ever eaten a meal were you savor every chew and find yourself humming with happiness? Well get the damn Hanger Steak and you'll know what I mean. Cleveland, your winters are shit, so you deserve to have a little piece of heaven! Fr. David, see you Sunday to confess my sins!!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Cleveland and surely one of the top in all of the US. I had extremely high expectations for Lola and thankfully they were all exceded. The service was amazing, even bringing a special birthday dessert for my best friend but the true start was the food. The beef cheek pierogi was one of the best bites I have ever had  (and would go back just for that), the lamb was perfectly cooked and seasoned and the peanut butter dessert was the perfect rich ending to our meal. Both of us had one of the best dining experiences ever and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We were so disappointed by this restaurant. We had been so looking forward to it because we are huge fans of Michael Symon, but we found it to be very average. Maybe we hyped it up too much beforehand. Maybe it was the server's seeming inconvenience at accommodating our food allergies. But everything was just truly \"okay\"."}
{"text":"Highlights: The beef pierogi, duck entrée, and the honey goat cheese ice cream. 

This restaurant reminds me of Fleming's. I liked the ambience for the most part, but I found the floating tables to be a little close to each other... we were sitting next to a group of guys who weren't having the most tasteful conversation. That's my main gripe.  

We enjoyed the pierogi. It was served to us on two different plates... which I appreciated because I didn't have to fight Allyn over the appetizer. :)

I ended up ordering the Hangar steak and my love ordered the duck entrée. I did enjoy my steak and it was perfectly cooked to order... but I did find it a tad salty. Other than that, it was fantastic! But the duck entrée stole my heart. And thus, I stole bite after bite from Allyn. (He claimed he was full, but I know better. I'm sorry I ate so much of your entrée!) 

For dessert we ordered the honey goat cheese ice cream and the pear/caramel... I don't exactly remember the name. The honey goat cheese took a few bites to adjust to, but I quickly grew a liking to it. It reminded me a bit of cheesecake. 

Our server and various backwaiters were great. 

I do think the hostesses up front should be more friendly. They were hardly engaging. 

I'd come back here to try other entrées on the menu."}
{"text":"See profile site for full review with formatted pics.


I've enjoyed Flay and been blown away by Batali, thus when Clevelander Michael Symon was named the new Iron Chef I knew it was only a matter of time before I made the trip to Lola.  Having seen Chef Symon on Food Network a number of times over the past few months I admit I like his attitude and personality.....alas, his flagship restaurant and food didn't live up to the hype.

With regard to service, there were hits and misses.  Our server, a cocky fella named Tony K, definitely knew the notably short menu well and sold each dish adequately, but vastly overstepped his role when I attempted to place an appetizer order for the group (myself and 3 ladies) and he bluntly told me \"we'll let the ladies order first.\"  This move essentially led to ordering mains before appetizers and the table accidentally forgetting to order a couple side dishes until after appetizers were consumed.  Awkward.  Water was filled quickly and repeatedly, but the table bread was anemic and a total afterthought....white bread, plain butter, five 3/4\" thick slices from what I presume was a baguette.  Yawn.

Crispy Veal Sweetbreads w/ leeks, blue cheese, mushrooms were perfectly seared, crisp, and well textured with a great balance of flavors....one of the better presentations I've encountered.  
Crispy Shrimp w/ soft cheesy polenta, chilies, cilantro were less impressive with a relatively basic fried shrimp that my mother enjoyed vastly more than I - I will admit the polenta was fantastic, however.  
The highlight of the appetizers, by far, was the Fresh Berkshire Bacon w/ fruit slaw and BBQ sauce.....on par with anything David Chang is doing in NYC, perfecty textured, and an amazing contrast of the salty fatty pork with the crispy sweet fruit - a MUST order if you visit.

Halibut w/ Morels, Beans, Herbs, Gnocchi was poorly seasoned and bland overall, but the herb sauce was quite tasty with a complex blend of cilantro and rosemary.  Being a huge fan of gnocchi I was disappointed that only 8 small pieces were presented, though the texture was quite good.  
Black Bass w/ Clams, Mussels, Saffron Potatoes, Olives was well cooked and well textured, but suffered somewhat from an overly salty broth and far too few Mussels and Clams (2 of each if I counted correctly.)  The potatoes were excellent.
Beef Hanger Steak w/ pickle sauce, chilies, lola fries I did not taste as I don't particularly favor beef, but the pickle sauce was (once again) on par with Momofuku and the fries (double basted in lard with rosemary and sea salt) were excellent.
The highlight of the mains, like the apps, was the pork.  Smoked Berkshire Pork Chop w/ Chilies, cheesy polenta, bbq onions was large, flawlessly fatty yet perfectly textured, salty yet clean, and served with a perfect contrast of smooth cheesy polenta and sweet/spicy chilies/bbq onions.  As good as any pork I've ever encountered and the highlight of the menu by far.

The much hyped 6am special - French toast w/ maple bacon ice cream, carmelized apples was tiny, tasty, and unique, but in reality only a slice of bread drowned in butter and syrup, less than 10 grams of apples, and a tiny scoop of vanilla icecream with berkshire bacon bits embedded.
Savannah Summer - Cornbread, Butter ice cream Peach jam, candied pecan was also quite small and while the butter icecream was quite impressive and tasty, the cornbread was dry and flavorless with a tiny smear of jam that tasted no better than Smuckers.  The highlight of the dish was actually the caramel cookie decoration.
Sangria berry Sundae - Blueberry sorbet, chantilly cream, black pepper crumble was another unimpressive dish, though the sorbet was delicious....if there was any black pepper crumble, it was undetectable and somewhere buried in the mildly flavored cream.  
Strawberry Short Cake - Mascarpone mousse, strawberry sorbet, lemon curd, almond was possibly the least impressive with only the lemon curd tasting truly inspiring and the cake so small that once everyone had a sliver there was only ~2 inches left.

At $58/pp after tax and tip without any drinks, this certainly wasn't a \"break the bank\" kind of meal, but I've spent less at \"Iron Chef\" restaurants (Babbo, Otto, Mesa Grill) and been vastly more impressed.  I've also spent less at M@Miranova, Rosendales, Rigsby's, Lindey's, and Worthington Inn in Columbus and been vastly more impressed.  All told, Michael Symon does two things extremely well - Pork and Polenta - while doing a number of other things adequately, but at far too high a pricepoint for the quality or experience.  Sure, he has a great TV personality that many chefs may lack, but for such a celebrated name/restaurant, Lola likely isn't in my top 10 for Ohio let alone all time.  More attention to detail, more intuitive servers, more appropriate pricing.....Lola just isn't enough.

{"text":"Sophistication on a plate.......
Wonderful food & experience.
I had the flavorful pork chop with polenta and my wife had the scallops which melted in your mouth.  Their wine selection is astounding also.  Perfect location for an anniversary dinner."}
{"text":"The wife and I chose Lola for our 9th anniversary dinner.  We made the reservations weeks in advance and together we went.  

Upon arrival at Lola, we checked in and were told we would have to wait 10 minutes for our table and to go to the bar for a drink.  I looked at the packed bar and thought, 'hmmm, that's gonna be tough'.  I had to squeeze between two people, one of which was eating, so I felt really rude.  After about 5 minutes, I was able to get the bar tender's attention and I ordered a Chardonnay for the wife and a Pino Noir for me.  My Pino was really good.

Five minutes later, we were seated at our table in the back of the restaurant behind a pillar.  Candles were lit and the atmosphere was dark and romantic.  Then we were served sliced bread, which was crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle.  It was served with a creamy butter, which was also good.

For appetizers, we ordered Ceviche and Lola Fries, which we heard were spectacular.  I was surprised by the small size of the ceviche appetizer, but it was good.  The Lola Fries were shoestring size, cooked perfectly, and tasted very good, but I don't think they were better than the best fries of all time - McDonald's fries.  I also like Winking Lizard's fries better.  So they take a close third in Cleveland fries.

For dinner, the wife ordered the Smoked Berkshire Pork Chop, which was tender and delicious.  It was served in a barbecue sauce and the smokiness was awesome.  I stepped out of my comfort zone yet again and ordered the Calf Heart.  The waitress recommended that I get it medium-rare, so I did, even though I prefer my meats cooked medium.  Well, it ended up being chewy, which I didn't like and it really didn't have all that much flavor.  I found myself searching my plate for meager portions of sauces and other unidentifiable things to dip it in.  The portion was good (it looked to be about the size of a whole heart) and it was cut into thin strips.  We shared a side of seared asparagus, which was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious.

For dessert, we shared The 6 a.m. Special, which has brioche french toast, maple-bacon ice cream, and caramelized apple.  This was good, but the brioche didn't really add anything.

Overall, it was a very good meal and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who has the extra cash and is seeking a nice dining experience.  Our total bill came to $160 with four glasses of wine and tip.  It's one of the priciest meals I've eaten, but I wouldn't say it was the best meal I've eaten.  It's definitely up there though.

Recommend!"}
{"text":"If your idea of a good dinning experience is cramped seating, servers too busy to bother and a place so noisy that you can't hear others then you have come to the right place. 
We started off our evening with a kale salad and the corn bisque soup. Both were pretty good but not that interesting. For our entries the rib eye was cooked perfectly but the greens on top of the steak were too salty and added nothing to the dish. The lamb heart entree was very good. The side dish of corn and chanterelles was odd. The corn was sweet but the mushrooms were very salty and dehydrated. The blend of the two were underwhelming. We passed on desert. 
The meager wine list should be noted. Don't look for there to be many interesting wine selections by the glass. The red wine was served in the same glass as the white. I thought We were going to a fine dinning experience. We visited Lola's several years ago and loved the food and the service - the celebrity chef must be too busy to care about the food or service."}
{"text":"I went on a Thursday afternoon for lunch, and decided to sit outside and enjoy the sunshine. Looking back on it, I regret doing so. There was a street musician playing very close to our table and made it impossible for us to converse. Furthermore, the musician's large dog kept coming over to our table. Being as large as he was, his head could come right up to our table. That's not the restaurant's fault, but just a heads up to anyone debating about sitting inside or not. 

Our server was just ok. If anything, a little less than ok. I'm not sure if she was busy but it just felt like we were not a priority. Every customer is a priority! 

Anyway, the Lola burger was very good. So good, that I finished the entire thing. I especially liked the seasoning on the skinny fries. 

The pork belly pierogi was very delicious. Especially the sauce that is drizzled over the dish. 

Michael Symon's restaurants never fail to disappoint me. 

4 stars."}
{"text":"Upon reservation the restaurant accommodated us promptly. the waiter was merchant-like, encouraging us to order wine and desert; I personally prefer waiters to only intervene when prompted. LOLA has an ipad as the drinks menu; fancy fancy. i ordered this plum-flavored belgian beer that turned out to be $8 wood chuck. note to self: always try wine at a three dollar sign restaurant.

as advertised, beef pierogi was awesome. it has many different flavor in ways that you don't experience everyday. it is \"the difference\" you expect when you commit yourself (financially) for a fine dining. For entree, I tried the two pork dish: pork chop and the quail & pork belly. Pork chop doesn't have too many different flavors; it's mostly the pork chop and grits, but the flavor is very rich; it's one of those things you just describe as \"damn good.\" For me personally, it wasn't quiet the \"blew me away\" fine dining entree i hoped it would be. Pork belly was okay, while the quail was a bit salty but very flavorful; the side vegetables had refreshing and sour flavor and turned out to be my favorite part about this dish.

overall, i really liked beef pierogi, but was not blown away by the pork dish. between the two pork dish, i'd recommend the pork chop. and i wish i never ordered the $8 wood chuck."}
{"text":"Second time here, first time was about a year ago. As far as the service, they kept the bottoms of our glasses unseen and were very attentive, no qualms there. We had the beef cheek pierogis to start, 15 for 2, it was very rich and creamy, as one would probably expect from the tender and marbled cut of meat these pierogis were stuffed with, still I didn't think it was necessarily worth the 15 except for the chance to try this interesting cut of meat. For the entrees we got the lamb shank and a bacon wrapped sturgeon. The lamb itself was cooked to perfection, falling off the bone as it sat on a bed of tzatziki sauce, you could cut this thing with a butter knife it was so tender. I decided to branch out with the bacon wrapped sturgeon, never had anything like it, complimented with shredded apple and creamy spinach it was an interesting mix of sweet, salty, and buttery goodness. It's probably not a dish I would repeat, just because it's not my kind of thing. Overall, it's a nice establishment, but not a place I would necessarily say is a must visit."}
{"text":"Dinner: Improvable
---
When in town, I had the opportunity to dine at this local celebrity's establishment. I mean, who doesn't remember Michael Symon's attempt at chocolate-covered bacon strips during his brief stint hosting Dinner: Impossible? For the most part, this place did not disappoint. I wish I could rate this place 3.5 stars. 

A summary of our dining experience:
- Teriyaki flavored tartare (forgot exactly what they called it): tasted ok, but a bit too \"haute\"; only a handful of slices on an oversized rectangular plate. 
- beef cheek pierogi: very, very tender beef cheek. This was delicious. 
- Pork terrine - tender chunks of pork In gelatin, bacon bits in the arugula side salad, flavorful quiche
- Lola fries: shoestring fries dusted with rosemary; tasty, albeit a bit salty.  
-Pork shank - very tender, but again oversalted; on a flavorful bed of cabbage. I didn't \"get\" the fried capers. 
-Pork chop: nice crust, properly salted.
-vegetarian pasta with butternut squash: enjoyable. 
 - French toast with maple bacon vanilla ice cream: overall I agree with this dish's accolades, because the bacon bits did quite well as a crunchy/smoky addition to the vanilla ice cream. The French toast, unfortunately, was too fried and slightly hard.  

Overall a very enjoyable dining experience. They really need to control the salting of the food though."}
{"text":"On a 1-night business trip to Cleveland, my colleague and I went to Lola--twice. First we sat on the outdoor patio on  E. 4th street (great atmosphere) and enjoyed the beef cheek pierogi and crudo with some drinks. We came in at 5:30 and were clear with the wait staff that we were just there for drinks and apps. They could not have been nicer about it and were very attentive and unhurried despite the fact that we were not having a full meal. My colleague and I made the mistake of going elsewhere for dinner (Greenhouse Tavern, disappointing) but decided we had to come back to Lola for one more drink and dessert. What a great decision. We sat at the indoor bar and service was top notch again. We got the 6 A.M Breakfast dessert (just trust me, the maple bacon smoked ice cream is amazing) and the S'mores. Both were divine-- I'm drooling a little just thinking about it.  I am from Boston and my colleague is from LA and we both thought Lola had top-notch food and service. Hats off to Michael Symon. I never thought I would say this, but it has me looking forward to my next work trip to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"We made reservations for 530 before a show at playhouse square. I am only giving them 3 stars for the amazing food. Pirogies were amazing! Loved my hangar steak and Lola fries. Enjoyed a Georgia Mule. ( peach infused vodka) yum! And now for the service or lack there of. We were promptly seated with water and menus. And the wait began. I watched as waiters tried to determine who would wait on us. Although our waiter was friendly enough he was very inattentive.  I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Yum yum. One of the best restaurants in Cleveland that I've tried thus far.

A couple of my co-workers went to Lola with me for my birthday dinner. I was excited.. would Michael Symon's restaurant live up to its hype? 

Oh yes it did.

For appetizers, we got the bone marrow and the pork belly. The bone marrow was pretty good- slightly breaded, and tasted okay with the toast they provided. The pork belly was surprisingly good- had some butternut squash with it as well- wasn't too fatty, and my co-worker who was super hesitant to try it, also liked it as well. 

We asked the waitress of her suggestions for entrees. She began talking about Michael Symon like it was her best friend, all saying, \"yeah, Mike's in this big pork phase right now, so I would suggest....\" and then rattled off her choices. We decided to go with the venison, smoked pork chop, and for me, the calf heart. Woot. I love trying new things.

The venison was good. It wasn't super gamey at all- it was good. The pork chop was good as well- I still felt like it could be more moist, but it was good. My calf heart... was amazing. I was half expecting it to come out looking like a heart (ooh look, the tricuspid valve!), but no, all kidding aside, it was presented well- sliced up nicely. It was really really good. Super moist, tender, and flavorful. I am so glad I ordered it- definitely made my night.

For dessert, we ordered the 6am dessert- a bacon infused ice cream on top of french toast with a side of apples. The bacon ice cream is definitely way too much by itself (imagine biting into small pieces of bacon), but with the french toast...it was pretty amazing. Good pairing.

I was definitely impressed with Michael Symon's restaurant. Five stars. :)"}
{"text":"We were super excite to try \"the most expensive restaurant in Cleveland\" and were left pretty disappointed.  The food was ok at best. There were a ton of fails and I'm really surprised that Michael Symon would sign off on some of these dishes.

1. We ordered the bone marrow as an appetizer and it came with battered, flash fried marrow with various sides that you can pair up with to increase the flavor profile of the marrow. The sides were a GREAR additions however, the marrow was soaked in oil and the flavor of the oily marrow totally overpowered everything else

2. The hanger steak. It was decent. Lacked a bit of flavor. Came with a side of fries that were dry.

3. Brussels sprouts. Same issues as above. It was great and crispy but lacked flavor.

4. Pork chops. The pork was totally dry. Lacked flavor. Had no punch. Not memorable in any way. 

5. The toffee pudding desert. Once again, so close to being perfect but a miss. The peaches were simply scooped and dumped on the plate. If the peaches were caramelized, this would've been a hit!

All in all, this place is so close to perfection but has minor things that make each and every dish miss its mark by a long shot."}
{"text":"To be fair Lola is a hit or miss. Although it is assumed that Lola is better than Lolita but I personally like lolita better cuz it's actually consistent.

Anyways, back to lola. Overall, I was pleased by the restaurant. The food were well made and I could tell that they put a lot of thoughts into it. They change their menu from time to time so you may not be able to get the same thing again in the future. 

The first time I went, I ordered a duck dish. It was one of the most amazing duck dish I have ever had. It was very tendered - slightly undercooked but just about right that it didn't give out that duck smell. The sauce also complimented the dish well. The desserts were rather mediocre so I would not recommend that. The second time I ordered a pork shank - it was a rather big dish and it was probably in the pressure cooker for the right amount of time that you could split the meat easily with your fork. BUT this dish lacked some complexity to it and I felt that my mom could make it better in an asian way. For appetizer, I remember I had lobster one time - it was a cold dish (warn you) and it was kinda bland to be honest. It was probably more suitable for a hot summer menu. It could be more \"citric\" that it was. Other appetizers were great."}
{"text":"We decided to stop by here for a late lunch last Wednesday after spending time at the R&R HOF.  We used open table for our reservation, but it was not necessary on this particular week day, this time of the day.  We got one of the huge half circular booths.  You gotta love the golden colored vinyl.  Loved the fact that their drink/wine/beer list is on an iPad.  Very cool.

BJ got the hanger steak which is basically a salad with onion, cucumber, arugula, chiles, and yummy vinaigrette.  The steak was cooked a perfect medium.  It wasn't huge, a perfect lunch portion.  I got a salad and ham sandwich combo.  I picked the spinach salad with watercress, fennel, oranges, beets, goat cheese, and pumpkin seeds.  Very good.  My half sandwich was divine.  No one does pig like Lola's.  So good.  Amazingly tender and so full of flavor.  For dessert, we shared a honey panna cotta.  It was incredible. 

And almost as good as the food, Derek Jeter was in the booth next to us.  He was in town because the Yankees were playing the Indians.  He was having lunch with his father, most likely in anticipation of his 3000th hit.  So cool.  Unfortunately, it didn't happen in Cleveland."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  Friendly/knowledgable staff and the food is worth the price!  I drove here from Pittsburgh just to try the food of an iron chef and it was worth it!

I had the pork chop with polenta and it was rich and creamy.  I don't normally like pork but I figured Michael Symon would be the guy to get me to change my mind and he succeeded!   For dessert I had the chocolate cake which was spectacular.

I also brought my vegan girlfriend and the waiter offered a gnocchi-type pasta in a marinara sauce.  My girlfriend hates marinara but she was in shock over how good this dish was.  To quote her: \"One of the best vegan dishes I've ever had!\"

I recommend coming here and making reservations.  I made my reservation online and put on there that one of us was a vegan.  It was nice not having to explain what vegan was or if they could make something special.  

All in all a great experience."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant of all time! I actually went to Lola for the first time back when it first opened during it's first few months in 2006.  I loved it and was a bit sad bc I wasn't sure when the next time i'd be heading back out to Cleveland again.

Finally a few weeks ago I was able to return back to Cleveland for work to have another taste of Lola. Crazy thing is, I had the same exact waiter as my first time around. How do I remember this?! I guess you just can't forget exceptional service! Everything was amazing then and everything is amazing now.

In summary... here are the list of things I got...
- Appetizer - Pork Belly - can't go wrong with pork belly, ever.
- Entree - Smoked Berkshire Porkchops & a Duck special - perfectly cooked and super moist
- Dessert - The \"6 a.m. Special\" - brioche French toast, maple-bacon ice cream, caramelized apple. Bacon ice cream!!!! 

So yummy!!! Michael Symon totally deserves his Iron Chef title!"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to go with a party of 9, and we ordered the entire menu. :) the ambience was great, lots of textures on the walls, which was also reflected in the food. 

The Apps: a bit on the heavy side. The yellowtail crudo was great- loved the burst of salmon roe. Beef cheek perogi super tender and great creaminess. The oysters were a bit small. I was hesitant with the fried bone marrow but loved the crunch it delivered. 

The Salads: the menu does not do them justice. Everyone shined. The burrata was especially tender. Great addition of in season peaches. 

The Entrees: hanger steak and ribeye. Just no words. All the meats were cooked perfectly, but these two shined. Loved the anchovy butter and house made steak sauce reduction (OMG, eat on everything). The chicken sausage is incredibly tender - the pork fat really helps here. Halibut was perfection. Great sauce and mushrooms. Gnocchi - definitely house made, definitely the best texture. Rivals ones made by an Italian chef. No joke. Skip the pork chops - bland and tough, and salmon - same. Lamb hearts were really popular among the group; I'm just sad that I don't like lamb. 

The Desserts: the pastry chef deserves an award. You cannot misstep here. Highlights: the yogurt was so light and perfectly balanced. Really rich with flavor but not overbearing. Basil ice cream really delivered. Loved the dill in the mango sorbet. 6am is so so good. Tiramisu (no my favorite dessert) was beautifully deconstructed. 

Would like: slightly more descriptive menu to better set expectations. More adventurous menu, understand chef Symon is balancing cle tastes and pushing the envelope there. Lighter apps to balance the full flavors of the entrees."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that I haven't had the privilege of dining here because I'm in Virginia. But here I am singing their praises. Why? Because a dear friend had surgery in your fine city and she missed out on so much during her surgeries journey.

Knowing this, hubby and I decided to help her celebrate by setting her concerns aside for an evening and setting up a date night for her and her husband before her return home. Any place that does this and sets it up for us to pay for their dining experience is #1 in my book. I may never have the opportunity to dine here or at any of Michael Symons restaurant, but if I ever find myself in Cleveland, I will try my darnedest to try his restaurant! Until then, I can only live vicariously through my friend!  Our request from her? For a private review that will make my 13 yr.old salivate."}
{"text":"Lola had a great atmosphere (dark and romantic), and fabulous service. Everyone was really nice and very accommodating. They had 5 star service for sure. 

This might sound a little crazy: but get the lamb's heart. I was feeling particularly adventurous while I was there, but after giving it a try, it's not such an adventurous dish that anyone should be shy. It is prepared beautifully, and served sliced and mixed with veggies. It tastes and feels almost exactly like lamb kebab. It's delicious! We also had the beef-cheek pierogi, which were pretty good, and the pork chop was great."}
{"text":"Our experience at Lola was amazing, from the food to the service. Jerrell, our server, was very kind and knowledgeable. A member of our party has a severe food allergy and the staff was very attentive in making sure the food was perfect. 

For apps we had the beef cheek pierogi and the veal sweetbreads. The sweetbreads were a favorite for me. Very tender and seasoned well. 

For entrees the table had the calves heart (freakin awesome!), the hanger steak, scallops, and the halibut. My favorites were the hanger steak, scallops, and heart.

For dessert we had a deconstructed tiramisu and the peanut butter crunch. Both were great. If you are ever in Cleveland stop by Lola and have an awesome dinner."}
{"text":"I've been dying to come here since the first day I got to Cleveland. Twenty-nine days later, here I am! Lola's being Chef Symon's restaurant, I expected to be wowed multiple times. 

I walked in and the decor was wow! From the double glass doors to the magnificent wine cellars behind the bar to the beautiful chandeliers. It was a definite wow. We didn't have reservations, but were able to be seated without a wait. The hostess was not the most pleasant, but oh well I guess that happens when you didn't call ahead. 

I ordered the halibut with morel mushroom, baby carrots, roasted artichokes, and pesto lemon. The dish was beautifully plated and full of color, but the taste did not deserve a wow. I had two pieces of halibut and one was cooked perfectly while the other one was a bit rare for my taste. The fish was bland and lacked any flavor. I even picked off a couple of fish bones. I was starting to get disappointed. I almost forgot; the bread and butter they provided isn't anything to wow about either. I did not like the taste of the bread and opted to let my coworker finish it off. 

With the disappointment of the entree, I made myself order dessert because I wanted to give Chef Symon a chance to wow me. I ordered the mango parfait with mango, lime, cashew, cilantro, and Pauline's banana bread. The dessert was a definite WOW WOW WOW! It was soo amazing. The different flavors fit perfectly together, and it was plated beautifully. I finally got my major wow! 

Overall, the restaurant is not bad, but for the money you pay for, it could be better. I gave the restaurant 4 stars mainly due to the amazing dessert. I would definitely go back for it."}
{"text":"If you are visiting Cleveland or are from the area and looking for a nice place for dinner, please please please check out Lola (but first make reservations).

I was in Cleveland for a Sunday night as a stop over en route to Chicago, and was looking for a nice place for dinner.  Found Lola and Yelp and decided to check it out.

When I checked in for my 7:30pm reservation on a Sunday night I was seated promptly, but the restaurant was packed.  

I wish I remembered my servers name.  If you are reading this review and remember me, thank you.... your service was incredible and I am forever grateful on how kind you were to me. 

Back to the review:
Was seated promptly and was given my menu.  When my server arrived and introduced herself she also gave me an ipad which was also the wine list and cocktail list.  This was one of the only things that was off putting.  Lola is kept at candle lit setting, and being handed a bright screen was a little startling.  The list was interactive (i.e. descriptions of cocktails, and well organized), but it was so bright.  No fault of the staffs, it is nice to have something they can immediately update if something is out of stock, or they are offering/ featuring a new cocktail or wine.  I digress.  
The busser / secondary server was also very attentive, filling my water without having me ask and politely checking on me without being overbearing.  Again- if you are reading this, I am so sorry for not noting your name, but you were awesome!

My server made a couple of suggestions for cocktails or wine.  I settled on a classic favorite of mine, an aviation cocktail.

To start, I ordered the spicy tomato bisque- soup du jour.  Nice and rich, not overpowered by spice and flavorful.  

For my main entree, I ordered the smoked pork chop.  Cooked perfectly, excellent portion size, and full of flavor without overpowering the integrity of the meat.

Service was impecible.  The only (minor) complaint is that it took longer than it should have to get my entree.  My server acknowledged it was taking a while and apologized profusely.  Again, she was incredible.

I visited Lola on May 22nd.  I left a note for my servers thanking them for their service with my check.  I just wanted to say- thank you again for taking such good care of me.  I had just found out I lost my friend very tragically and suddenly that day and your kindness and hospitality was more than any sympathy I could have asked for.  Thank you so much."}
{"text":"Lola was my first restaurant stop in Cleveland and by far, my favorite.

To begin... the restaurant is beautiful.. I will say it is on the classier side, so you may want to put on your fancy eatin' duds to enjoy this restaurant.

I came for lunch and ended up getting one of the lunch combo's.  You have your choice of a soup, salad and half sandwich combination...  

While all of the options sounded fantastic I ended up getting the tomato bisque and half of the muffaletta sandwich.  The soup was excellent.  Spicy and rich and came with a delicious amount of blue cheese on top!  The muffaletta was also amazing.  Fresh meat, cheese and some excellent pickled vegetables all nice and toasty on some fresh bread.  I mentioned to my mom it was better than the muffaletta I had in New Orleans a few years ago!

Their lunch menu has a nice selection of sandwiches, burgers, soup, salads and smaller sized entrees.  They also have a full bar.  I ended up getting a wonderful glass of Pinot Noir to enjoy with my meal.

The service was fantastic.  From the hosts at the front door, to the waiter to the nice young man that kept refilling the water bottle, it was a wonderful experience.

I don't know much about Michael Symon, but damn, he has a good restaurant.  I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"So the wife and I are having our first child and she LOVES to travel so she arranges (as she always does) our \"supposed\" last trip before our daughter straps us down with feedings and fatigue.

Ordered:
Bone Marrow: overload for 2 people but very fatty good. The blue cheese with roast garlic sauce was amazing
Duck Mousse: If it was anything over $12, I would have been thoroughly disappointed
Pierogi: Not enough texture for me but overall it was good
Pork Chops: were AMAZING and the creamy polenta was to die for! Highly recommended
Bacon Ice cream: was really salty for me but nice concept.

Everything here is delicious and cooked and prep'd with precision.  I'll most likely never be in Cleveland again for the rest of my life but it was great!  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like it here. Heck I made a reservation before I even left Florida so I could get in here on a friday night. I was highly disappointed and am considering grading two stars instead of my generous three.

Walked into a glass entranceway (wonder how many people literally do) to a hostess who says \"we will be seating on time this evening so it will be just a moment\" Since it was just a moment we didnt bother ordering wine at the bar and saved it for our dinner.10-15 \"moments\" later our table was ready.

This place is dark, cozy dark, almost cant read the menu dark, but luckily they have battery operated candles in the glasses on the tables so assist (tacky)

So we get the Ipad of wine list and begin to peruse. No stags leap, no Opus, no Silver Oak, so I inquire to our waiter who brings us two bottles of cab sauv. one at $65 one at $125. The $65 was decent from Mount Eden Vineyards, really pretty good for a reasonbly priced wine.

So hubby started with the pork belly. Served with watermelon, jalapenos, basil ($12) . It was really good. The fresh jalapeno would be a tad overwhelming for some but with the watermelon freshness it defintiely set it off. I had the beef cheek periogi. ($12). The filling of beef cheek was delicious bu the periogi was undercooked. The top one was ok, but once I got half through to the second one the dough was literally raw. They didn't even brown it, it was a disaster. DId I send it back? No I was halfway through and thought dinner would make up for it.

It didn't

Hubby got the Duck ($28) described as magret breast, corn, peaches, mole 28. It was no where near that. It was served medium rare, well more like rare, no peaches no mole, in fact more fresh jalapeno completely overwhelmed this dish. The corn and mole (not a traditional one by the way) were completely hidden by the taste of the raw hot peppers. Jalapeno and duck do not go together. Period.

I had the scallops ($30) described as served with asparagus, fava beans, bacon, pea tendril. Well the three scallops were served raw, no not rare, no not med rare, barely browned and raw, They returned to the kitchen quickly. Second attempt was not much better. They were served with green scallop shreds, some itsy bitsy pieces of bacon, a couple fava beans and a schmear of asparagus foam. (God I hate this foam faze!) It was a disaster. Trying to salvage the night for hubby I forced one down and got the rest to go blaming it for being too heavy. (and he believed that?!)

They were aware it was our 20th anniversary and for that we got two 1\" mini pumpkin pies. Wow, thanks for the splurge , hope it didn't bust the budget.

The clincher on this evening? Oh seeing the \"remarkable\"  Michael Symon come in dressed in rolled up blue jeans , a flannel shirt and clogs.

Remarkable? I think not"}
{"text":"Have been here twice, once just for dessert and again for an entire meal, I and really enjoyed myself both times.  

Going for dessert, I sat at the bar with my date and had donuts and hot chocolate.  I almost didn't order it because, to be honest, I don't really like donuts, but I'm glad I did because oh my god I loved those donuts.  They were like little fried clouds dipped in either tangy sweet orange or earthy hazelnut glaze.  The hot chocolate itself was a small portion of thick rich chocolate deliciousness.  Oh, they were almost-falling-off-my-chair, can't-stop-moaning-in-public delicious.  Get some whenever you get the chance.

The next time I went, it was for a full dinner.  While the donuts (Doooooonuuuuuts) remain a stand out in my mind, I had the only salad I have ever been truly excited about at dinner.  Think about this: a salad.  It's not exciting.  This salad was.  It was spinach and cranberries and goat cheese, and the dressing was unusual and sweet.  I just loved it.  Followed by venison, which I'd never had before but which I was glad I tried here, tender and delicious, hiding some incredible pickled cabbage and perfect apples...so good.  I finished up with the lemon mousse.  I should have gotten the donuts again.  Not that it wasn't delicious, because the mousse was very good, especially served as it was with a sprig of sugared mint leaves, so tasty!

The service was also excellent, the server was attentive but also let us take our time, all in all really great."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what I'd find in Cleveland but this was a pleasant find.  More energy and atmosphere than most of the other places in the neighborhood, I wandered in and found a place at the bar.  The bartender seemed to make everyone feel right at home.  She knew some of the locals particular tastes and even carried on a good conversation about my particular poison, single malt scotch (of which they actually had my favorite, Lagavulin).

A great test of a restaurant begins with their bread and especially their butter.  While mine came out a bit late, with the entree, the butter was soft and sweet.  Not just a plain stick.  The bread was also very good - a crispy crust with a fluffy white inside.

I ordered the scallop entree and was pleasantly surprised by the mix of tastes.  Scallops perfectly seared over an orange jus with brussel sprouts and citrus wedges.  Everything blended together quite well.  There were just 3 scallops though so I thought it was rather small for the ~$26 price.

I wouldn't give it 5 stars unless it was truly amazing, and the portion was surprisingly small, but I would say it's well worth the hype and deserves a stop when in town, though I will explore other places first before going back here."}
{"text":"We visited Lola for my husband's birthday, and you guys, it was the perfect celebratory experience! I'd rate Lola five stars, hands down, if the dining room hadn't been about a million degrees in the middle of February--we were dying to get out of there by the end of the night for some fresh air. Such a weird experience. 

We actually happened upon Lola during Cleveland Restaurant Week, which made things extra amazing-- my husband went for the restaurant week menu, and I opted for their soup special and the \"fish and chips\". 

Lola's fish and chips is actually a beautiful tuna tartare salad--salty and crunchy and savory and just plain beautiful. I love rare/raw tuna, and this was one of my favorite iterations. I also got a broccoli, rice, and fried cheese curds soup, of which the cheese curds were the highlight. The soup was poured table side, which was a nice touch. 

The tasting menu was yummy as well-- the beef cheek pierogi were beautifully tender, and the steak was superlative. The salad was just okay, but the dessert was great as well-- poached pear with gorgonzola ice cream. Yum! 

Service was attentive and helpful, and our cocktails were tasty (if slightly forgettable... it's a couple of weeks later, and I can't remember what we got). I want to go with five stars, but I was just so uncomfortable for an hour in the blazing heat."}
{"text":"I have not been back to Lola since my first visit, but it is not due to lack of effort or desire. You can often find me pacing back-and-forth...outside Lola's front door on East 4th on a Friday evening....gazing longingly into the windows....undecided if I should act like schmuck and ask if there are any tables available (there won't be any...I know this), or just hang around and beg for scraps like a stray animal. I feel an irrestible pull to this place...like a black hole sucking my dwindling dollars into an unfathomable void. I remember my champagne smelled like bleu cheese and tasted like honey. I remember those unf---ingbelievable fries. I'm obsessed. I need serious help. 

My wife has picked up on my behavior. I'll suggest going to a different East 4th Street restaurant for dinner...maybe Saigon, maybe Zocalo...but she knows this is just a deceptive ploy. She knows where I REALLY want to go. 

I want to be inside you, Lola. We need to consummate our love again."}
{"text":"Great ambience. Good service. Decent food. Pricey. I don't think that the overall dining experience compares well with other big city high end restaurants, but it'll get the job done for a special night out in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This is only for the bar, and what a beautiful bar it is.  We sat for one drink, ordered from the tablet menu.  Both bartenders were chatty and professional.  I absolutely loved the lit bar and want to come back for an actual meal.  One day soon."}
{"text":"Vegans and vegetarians beware. Although the staff is willing to modify the menu to accommodate, there really isn't any consideration put into the menu for our dietary preference. 

The ambiance is very nice and the staff are very helpful! The wine and beer list is also quite good!"}
{"text":"You come to Lola's for a leisurely evening -- not just for a meal. To get the most out of this wonderful experience, bring good people and come prepared to make yourself comfortable and enjoy a delicious evening (*be patient)!"}
{"text":"We had a team dinner here, and everyone raved about their food. I had the scallops which were expertly prepared and had great flavor (bacon makes everything better!). We had ordered one of their cakes for a special occasion. It was simple but beautifully decorated and tasted amazing - classic red velvet and the frosting wasn't too sweet or rich. The atmosphere was good with a very cool bar area. While the restaurant was pretty busy, it wasn't overly loud. If I wasn't just visiting Cleveland for work, I would definitely make a return visit!"}
{"text":"Honestly I'm a little disappointed about the food, the service was nice tho. 
My friends and I had dinner the other day to celebrate my new job. The appetizer Charcuterie was good, however that's probably the best dish that we had over the night. 
The complimentary bread was just ok, cold. One of my friend ordered lamb loin, which was tender but very salty. Both me and my friend are big fan of hotpot, So I really considered us to have high tolerance of salt. One of my friend ordered the king salmon, it's crispy on the outside but a little dry inside, and it's a little bland. One of my friend ordered the scallops, it was fine, scallops was tender and flavorful, presentation was nice. no complaints, but not surprisingly good-- I admit that I had better scallops at pier W. One of my friend had the smoked pork chop, she complained about the source was too little. Also the meat was undercooked especially near the bone. I had the Cioppino, which again, in my opinion, was too salty. The king crab might be a little overcooked. I'm a big fan of king crab, I almost always order the entree with king crab if it's available, and I have to say that it was prbly one of my worse experiences of King crabs. The sausage was a little dry. I barely finished half of my plate, but I was actually super hungry.
So at the end of our dinner, none of us ordered any desserts.

All in all, maybe my expectation was too high, but I always judge food by the number on the check. This is supposed to be a fine dining place, but except for the service... ...um... ...idk"}
{"text":"Lola is in a great location in downtown Cleveland. The atmosphere is warm, but the lighting is lacking. The food however  hit on every level. I ordered a specialty rye drink that was quite tasty to start the meal, my wife(usually a wine drinker) also ordered a specialty drink which she did not care for, fortunately I thought it was good. 
 For an appetizer I had ceviche that was lovely in taste and presentation while my mate said that her heirloom tomato salad was \"delicious\".  I often order duck when I dine out and was very happy that I repeated this at Lola, it was one of the finest duck dishes I've ever had.  My wife ordered the salmon, one of her favorites, and she loved it. 
  Coming from Boston we are used to paying quite a bit more for meal of this caliber and if we ever return to Cleveland we will definitely stop by Lola again (maybe twice)."}
{"text":"The reason to come to Lola I suppose is the designer food - but my favorite? Bon Vivant bartender Dan Rogan!!  This is bar talk and service at its best.  The man was born to it."}
{"text":"The food and service were both top notch.  However, I withheld the fifth star because the bar area is organized such that it was impossible to grab a drink while waiting to be seated without annoying the people already seated and eating at the bar. They could fix this by having a server patrol the waiting area to take drink orders.  That said, I would definitely go again.  I had the scallops and pork chop, and both were prepared flawlessly."}
{"text":"Alex: the first thing I noticed when I sat down at my table was that the chandelier hanging above is very beautiful to look at, but needs to be dusted.  Scallops were cooked well and they tasted good with the sauce. 

Jen: Lola is Ho-hum. There were more lo's than hi's at Lola.  Service outshines the food though cutlery was quick to disappear and slow to return. Beef cheek pierogi was dull to all the senses.  Lunch menu devoid of all cooked vegetables. 

Zach: corn soup was great!  Mac and cheese was good but the portion was too big for me.  The bread was warm so the butter melted nicely. 

Jim: Trout on puréed eggplant was OK. The nice crust faded to limposity within minutes.  The marinated red onion slices giveth and the orange slices and parsley taketh away. Fresh shelled peas were a common, lightly distributed garnish.  Mac and cheese would be improved by a smaller portion coupled with fresh cooked green vegetables; less cloying and more nutrition."}
{"text":"I found myself back in Cleveland so naturally I had to have dinner at Lola.  I'm happy to report that they're still dishing out top notch food.  On this particular night I decided to treat myself to a Pork trifecta: Braised Berkshire Bacon, Smoked Berkshire Pork Chop, and the 6 A.M. Special to cap it all off.  

The Brasied Bacon was tender and succulent.  The Asian inspired flavors (I detected hints of either Five Spice or Star Anise) blended perfectly with the brightness of the carrots, apple, and orange that were also in the dish.  The Pork Chop came pre-sliced and served atop a rich and hearty layer of cheesy polenta.  Don't worry, they include the bone for your gnawing pleasure.  The pork itself was moist, tender, and loaded with smokiness (the product of a 12 hour cold smoke process we're told).  If that's not comfort food I don't know what is.  The 6 A.M. Special is every bit as good as I remember it to be, with a few minor updates.  Instead of Brioche, the French Toast is now made from Panko crusted pound cake.  The Maple Bacon ice cream is still my all-time favorite and really needs to be in the frozen aisle of my local grocery store sometime soon.  Step your game up Ben  & Jerry's!  

Sure the walk from my hotel got a tad sketchy till I got to East 4th Street, but the food at Lola makes every fear-for-your-life-moment along the way worth it."}
{"text":"Good service.  Very tasty food.  The bacon maple ice cream was great.   We did not experience service issues that others mentioned.  In fact our server was proactive to ask us what we were doing to find out if we had to make a show."}
{"text":"Way over priced for average steak. You are paying the food network star for his fame not good food. So many better places to check out in Cleveland."}
{"text":"We were passing through Cleveland and decided to check out this restaurant which has the same moniker as moi...yours truly.  It was a great choice!  

Lola's is an upscale dining establishment which on the night we were there seems to attract a lot of young professionals.  It can be loud; in fact one table of diners asked to be moved because the conversation from another table was too raucous.

The service, however was great!  Starting with the bread which was hot and delicious, our entrées  were seasoned to perfection and for dessert...well, they heard it was a special day for us, so the pastry chef added a special sparkle with candles.  Nice touch!

The celebrity chef was not on site during our visit, but our server indicated that he would have signed the menu if he was. The only thing which was uncomfortable was how cold our area was...we couldn't figure out where the vent was.  Fortunately, a server noticed our discomfort and located the vent and covered it up which made the experience much more pleasant."}
{"text":"The deep fried marrow bones were an absolute standout.

Skirt steak entrée (with fries) was very good, but didn't quite match the bone marrow in terms of overall astonishment.  Still great though.

Good cocktails.  Not the best ever, but pretty decent."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about our evening at Lola. We arrived on Friday around 8:30 pm without a reservation (I had no idea what time we would be ready on our travel day.) We planned to stay at the bar and eat or wait for a table. As soon as Dave greeted us at the bar, Karen -- the great hostess -- told us she had a cancellation and took us to a beautiful booth. The service and the meal were fabulous. My husband had the Beef Hanger Steak and I had the Sturgeon. I'd never had Sturgeon before and our waiter said it's hard to find since it's such a big fish. BOTH WERE AMAZING! Our martinis were perfect. The service was friendly and professional. We also had an early anniversary celebration. After dinner: we sat at the bar and had great conversation with Dave and excellent cocktails. We were told by other diners that we should have ordered the Pierogi as an appetizer. Next time we will for sure. BTW, the atmosphere is beautiful but not stuffy."}
{"text":"Happy times calls for a happy meal, all footed by a beloved best friend who called from NYC to arrange everything! The evening was perfect, and our meal was a close second. We started with the lobster app and crispy bone marrow. The bone marrow was the fave of the evening, and we still talk about it to this day! It is quite a spectacle in of itself, and I could have ate it as a meal! (Yummmm, go RBC!) For the main, the man had the rib eye added the side of crispy fries and I had the arctic char.  I couldn't find the prosciutto in the arctic char, and the man wasn't digging how the 'wild mushroom' was lathered over his rib eye, losing its' 'crispy edges' he said.   For dessert, we shared the mango parfait. It was good on a one tone note.  Lola gets a solid 4 stars.  The crispy bone marrow and fries completed me."}
{"text":"For me, a first-time trip to Cleveland had to involve dining at one of Michael Symon's restaurants. Lola was the obvious choice for an elegant \"girls' night out\" with my BFF. 

We arrived on time for our 8:45 dinner reservation and I noticed that it took longer than expected for our table to be ready. Once we were seated, it took even longer for our waitress to appear and greet us. We finally ordered drinks and at one point our waitress had to come back to the table because she forgot what we requested.

When it finally came time to order dinner, we decided to share the burrata appetizer, beef cheek pierogi appetizer, winter greens salad, and beef hanger steak entree. The appetizers were delicious and the best part of the dinner, in my opinion. The burrata was creamy and was paired very well with some fresh beets, walnuts and apple chips. The beef cheek filling inside the pierogi was cooked perfectly. The winter salad was just that: a salad. But to be fair, I hate salad and could never see myself getting excited about ordering one. I only ordered it in an attempt to add a \"healthy\" addition to the dinner. The steak entree was just okay and I can't really complain because we ordered it more well-done than I usually like since my dining partner hates rare meat. It came with a side of the \"lola fries\" which I wasn't the biggest fan of either. The fries were too skinny and oversalted. I did appreciate that they split both the salad and entree for us since we were sharing.

At the end of the meal we perused the dessert menu but I just couldn't bring myself to order. I felt way too full to enjoy dessert and I just wasn't blown away by the meal. For the price we paid, I felt that the service was much too slow and I expected much more from the food."}
{"text":"One of best restaurants I've been too. Service is always great and the food is amazing. Love the Beef pierogies and Smore's dessert. Love the French press coffee too. Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"You are going to spend a good amount of money eating here, but it is worth every dollar. I had the $40 ribeye and it was the best ribeye that I have ever had. Bold statement right? Yes. Excellent service. Good job Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for the right occasion to try Lola, and finally I just gave up and decided to give it a go on an average Saturday night. This is the perfect spot for date night; everything from the food/cocktails down to the silverware was aesthetically pleasing, fancy, and trendy.

We were promptly greeted after being seated and presented with an ipad with various wine selections and hand-crafted cocktails. I chose a peach cocktail w/ egg white while my date chose the O.M.G. Both tasted like something a 21-year-old West 6th chick would order, but to be honest, that's the kind of libation we were in the mood for. I have to admit that I'm a fan of shaking up the cocktail and pouring it tableside. It gave me that extra \"wow\" factor.

I don't know what Lola does to their pork, but it is swine heaven. I've had beef melt in my mouth, but never pork. The pork literally melted into a puddle of bacony-goodness on my tongue. The pool of cheesy polenta underneath only added to each breathtaking bite. My date had the duck, and it was good, but the pork was unmatched. 

The noise level seemed very high the evening I dined here. It was Saturday night and very busy, but I had serious trouble hearing my date. It's not a problem for us since we're boring and know each other all too well, but I wouldn't recommend Lola as a place for a new couple looking to get to know each other.

I'll definitely be back to Lola. It's not my favorite Cleveland restaurant, but I know my high expectations will always be met here."}
{"text":"Lola is fancy.  As someone visiting Cleveland for the first time and spending a sum total of 24 hours in the city, strolling down the (relatively short block of) E 4th street on which Lola is located is a charming treat.  These Midwestern, Rust Belt cities have some beautiful brick buildings which go into good effect at creating a romantic, steampunk 1800s atmosphere.

I had a great bourbon cocktails served with a spiced, dried apricot garnish which is known as the Gunslinger.  I had a fine Italian wine from the wines by the glass list.  Unfortunately for you, the reader of this review, I boringly ordered a flank steak with french fries which was very good, but likely wasn't the dish to order if I really wanted to understand what Lola has to offer.

It was booked from 5-9:30pm so I arrived at 5:00 and grabbed one of the 10 or so seats at the bar.  Those all filled up by 6:00pm if not earlier, so make reservations."}
{"text":"Expensive, but worth it! The Hangar Steak is to die for!"}
{"text":"Simply put... with so many reviews I'll give a bullet point approach. 
- Great location 
- Fun and authentic staff
- Creative yet down to earth eating
- Fabulous tastes and combination with tremendous balance
- Simple and relaxing atmosphere/decor

Summary, this Michael Symon establishment speaks right to the dream of Cleveland. Friendly, Un-pretentious, Ethnic, Flavorful, Simple, Cost effective, Food basket of the country that dreams of shedding the \"underdog\" assumptions. 
While I travel around the world, this place is my favorite place to eat anywhere.... that says a lot. 

My favorite experience here, was to let our server who was quite candor at first to choose the cocktails for my friends wife and my wife. (let's see if he has any skill) He looked at them for a moment, made his estimations and brought them two drinks... to our amazement he completely embodied their personality in the selection he brought to each of them. 
We laughed and agreed this guy, kicks a**. 
Thanks Lola for keeping it real..."}
{"text":"We came here for a date night and got seated immediately by a friendly manager or host the server was great and helpful and the ribeye was very tasty! 10/10!!"}
{"text":"One of the BEST places I've been to.  Great menu, service and ambience.  We had vegetables, seafood and the steak.  All were fantastic and cooked to perfection.  The wine list was very good.  What a gem in Cleveland.  Michael Simon really out did himself with this place.  Way to go brining it home Michael.  Cleveland is lucky to have you.  We will definitely return if in Cleveland."}
{"text":"On a road trip to the east coast my girlfriend and I stopped in Cleveland just to try Michael Symon's dishes at Lola. I wasn't disappointed.

The hostesses and our server were all very friendly and professional. The atmosphere was very good.. It was somewhat dark and noisy, but the noise level was because they were very busy. We were able to have a conversation without shouting, which was nice. We seated very close to the kitchen with a good view of the cooks. Wow, were they busy!

The \"Braised Berkshire Bacon\" starter might be the best thing I have ever eaten in my life. Tender, porky, sweet and rich.. it was amazing. The carrot/ginger/apple garnish and the sauce were equally as good.

For entrees I had the hanger steak and my girlfriend had the pork shank. I was disappointed with the hanger steak. It seemed overseasoned and too salty. It was tender and cooked nicely, though. The Lola Fries were decent, but again, I think they were too salty. The pork shank was delicious. It was amazingly tender, rich, and savory. It could have used a little more apple (or other sweet fruit) slices to help balance it out but overall it was really good. I would recommend the pork shank to someone, but not the hanger steak.

For dessert we really wanted to try the 6 AM Special (french toast with ice cream) but we were already very full and didn't want something too heavy. Our server suggested we try the mango parfait, which was light and refreshing, but nothing amazing. 

Overall, I enjoyed Lola very much. I would love to eat here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined at Lola's this past weekend and loved it. He had the duck and I had the hanger steak. Very yummy! Service was excellent . We did not have a reservation so we had the choice to sit at the bar and we did , the bartender was attentive, drinks were good. I did have a problem however with the hostesses. I thought four hostesses were a bit much. Eye candy yes, but they really need to have better personalities! At least when people leave one of the four could say \" thank you for dining with us tonight or have a good night. Something! None of the four said anything.  That being said the owner could save himself some money and have only two cuties at the front.  Loved the food and would recommend the restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been traveling for work to Cleveland on and off for three years now and I'd never ventured to Lola (mostly because I never could get in.) Finally decided to make my way there and planned ahead to actually get a reservation. Atmosphere was cool but definitely felt a little underdressed and judged a bit. Drink menu came out on an iPod which seemed excessive though the drinks were quite good. We ordered bone marrow, a charcuterie board, and truffle fries as appetizers which were all super good. I got the special which was scallops with pork belly and spinach - amazing. Scallops were perfectly cooked and I just love pork belly. For dessert we got a deconstructed s'mores. It was good but wouldn't say it's worth the price. Overall food and drink is amazing though the atmosphere is a little pretentious."}
{"text":"On our visit 10/12, four high school classmates from Warrensville Hts. High School, class of 1966, had a mini 50th class reunion. We were treated like special people by the staff, from the moment we stepped in to the moment we left 3-1/2 hrs later! The staff was right there when needed, but never was there any impression they were there! That to me is what sets apart excellent restaurants from OUTSTANDING ones! We were talking, laughing truly enjoying ourselves and Michael, your staff made the evening even that much more enjoyable.  Speaking for all of us, we all appreciated the attention given this small, but closely knit party. 

Oh the food, superb on each dish! We all commented on wonders of each dish and between our jokes and laughter, each dish was enjoyed with each and every bite.  There are times highly rated spots do not live up to their reputation, but trust me, Lola will NEVER disappoint! An epicurean delight right here in my backyard! 

Travelers to Cleveland must include Lola if you really want to enjoy a truly outstanding dinner event!!"}
{"text":"There's no denying that the food at Lola is amazing - I'd say it's unparalleled as far as the Cleveland area goes.

To start, my wife and I shared the beef cheek pierogi,  which was pretty close to perfection.

For my entree, I had the sturgeon and creamed sweet corn w/ bacon and shrimp.  Again, close to perfection - the creamed corn was a most excellent complement to the fish.  I sampled my wife's lamb chop, which was tender and flavorful.

As much as I'd love to give five stars for our amazing meals, the waiter was kind of annoying and the noisy, rock & roll atmosphere didn't win any points either."}
{"text":"If you are anywhere nearby, you should make a beeline to Lola Bistro. The food was excellent! We had beef cheek pierogis, hanger steak, lamb shank and roasted vegetables. It was the best we've had ever. Our wait staff was helpful, friendly and generous. We loved everything except... the bitchy hostesses. When I addressed an issue with the two women at the hostess stand they stared at me like deer in headlights then they remorsefully, robotically said, \"Hope you enjoyed your stay.\" I won't let them ruin this review of an overall greet experience, but they need to go."}
{"text":"The flavors imparted in each dish were fantastic.

From the crudo plate and beef cheek pierogi appetizers to the tender scallops (my fav dish of the night) and the signature pork loin-- we could not have been happier with the quality and taste of everything we were served. A must dine at restaurant in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I stopped in with some colleagues while in town on business. I'm not usually one for high end places but I was up for a try. I was even more interested when I heard it was Michael Symon's place. 

We started at the bar. I had an Orval which is one of my favorites. The atmosphere was great. We then sat at a table for dinner. We had a scallop and a perogi app. I didn't think they were all that impressive. I had the mushroom orrechiette and polenta for dinner. Both were outstanding. And while I'm not big on sweets, the truffle they leave you with was amazing.

Still not the type of place I would frequent but well worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I tried Lola for the first time on Friday night and had an all-around great meal. The table ordered three appetizers-the famous beef cheek pierogis, the crab salad, and a charcuterie board. The crab salad wasn't bad, but it wasn't terribly memorable either. It was definitely the worst thing ordered that night, but it was still good, though a bit dull. The pierogis were a beautiful elevation of a Cleveland classic, very rich and filling. The charcuterie board was beautiful, with many kinds of cured meats and spreads. It was definitely big enough to share, as some was left uneaten despite all of us sampling the meats.

I ordered the hanger steak with fries. The steak was beautifully cooked, exactly as I ordered. And the fries were thinly cut, crisp, and delicious. They were brushed in rosemary, which made the even tastier. Someone ordered the pork chops over polenta which was also a delicious dish (and I normally don't like polenta, but theirs was so tasty).

Our waitress was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable, as I would expect at a restaurant of this level. The impressive wine list was presented by iPad. 

My one criticism... the steak didn't come with a vegetable. I understand that Lola is often playing with traditional steel-mill family favorites, so meat and potatoes is definitely a classic. Still, a green vegetable would have been a welcome addition. 

This is a TRUE Cleveland restaurant. For a meal that has playful, rather elegant food that stays true to the culture of this city."}
{"text":"so I hear Michael Symon is a big deal, especially because of Lola. I am a New Yorker and was in Cleveland for a couple of days. Many websites recommended Lola for dinner so my friend and I decided to come here. We arrived around 8 PM on a Wednesday evening and waited about 5-10 minutes before being seated. As poor grad students we only ordered one entree each per person. I had the hangar steak which comes out medium rare and a giant tin of fries. The steak was cooked perfectly and the sauce was tangy. The fries were thin and crispy, just the way I like it. I just wish it wasn't salted. My friend had the smoked pork chop which was so delicious. If I'm ever in town again, I would definitely order that and would also like to try the scallops dish. Overall the ambience is nice, and service is excellent. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Overall the presentation of all of the dishes was excellent but the flavor profiles were bland and unimaginative. I expected more from a restaurant at this price point. We were greeted with the grandeur of a spacious seating area with high ceilings and lavish art that set the expectations pretty high.

The drinks menu was not particularly user friendly. It was on an iPad app and you had to click through each individual drink to get to a description. The drinks themselves were decent, particularly the chili margarita. 

I love cauliflower and was so excited to try the roasted cauliflower that was highlighted on yelp. We were presented with a beautiful dish that was severely undercooked and lacking any real flavor. 

For my main course, I ordered the sea scallops. Once again the presentation was exceptional, but the taste was lacking. The potatoes felt raw and the scallops were chewy but the smoked mussels brought the punch the dish was lacking. 

The service was what I expect for a restaurant of this caliber - our waiter was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. Bringing white chocolate truffles with the check was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Wow is this an amazing gem in Cleveland. 

Micheal Symon has finally brought an upscale restaurant to his native town. 

The Food: Pretty damn good. I will never forget the beef cheek perogies. They were so tender and delicious. You can tell it was a staple that the restaurant like to take some pride in. I had the duck as my entre; possibly one of the best ducks I have ever had. Little fat and very tender and juicy. For desert, I'm not sure what it was called but all you have to know is that it had bacon ice cream. Yes, you read that right. 

Ambiance: Very nice design, upscale. I felt that the tables were too close together. Granted I know that is to maximize profits however I just didn't like the fact that my neighbor could reach over and take some of my food had he wanted to.

Service: Above par. Very helpful and quick with the menu. I did thing that the sommelier was a bit pushy with the higher priced wines. Come'on, I know you can get perfectly good flavors out of bottles that aren't in the $200 price range. 

Overall: Great place for a nice dinner. Great choice of wines to chose from. Good for a classy night out."}
{"text":"Don't ever change. This place is better than most Michelin 2 star restaurant we've been to. The lobster with corn, the bone marrow, the scallops!!!! Yum yum yum. Favorite restaurant in the us. This is after sf, NYC, Boston and mpls. Try this place and I hope the food never change."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to review Lola for a while and decided to finally do it after eating dinner there on New Year's Eve. Lola is the restaurant that put Cleveland on the food map. Chef Michael Symon brought inventive cuisine to a rust belt town and helped jump start the now thriving downtown Cleveland restaurant scene. 

They had a special prix fixe menu for New Year's Eve - three courses with a pour of Perrier Jouet. They brought out bread and butter first which was nice and crispy outside and pillowy inside. Next came the amuse-bouche which was toast points with king crab and roe. The flavors blended very well. My first course was oysters. Six east coast oysters, perfectly shucked and served with mignonette on point as usual. Great paired with the Perrier Jouet. The next course was braised pork shank over spaetzle and greens. This is the meat when someone says meat and potatoes. This behemoth pork shank was tender and flavorful. Symon sure knows a thing or two about elevating blue collar cuts of meat. Next up a couple chocolate truffles to pave the way for dessert, tasty morsels in their own right. The star dessert was a chocolate mousse with brownie and house made malt balls that was spot on and not too sweet. Using Edmund Fitzgerald Porter in the dessert definitely helped overcome some of the sweetness. A great ending to a wonderful meal.

At under $100 this meal was a well worth it, especially when you think about how much the equivalent would cost in New York or San Francisco. I've dined at Lola on numerous occasions for both business and pleasure and have yet to be disappointed by either the food or service."}
{"text":"My review based on two separate experiences at Lola:

Food - the food here is excellent; haven't tried everything on the menu but went twice with large parties so we sampled a large portion of the menu. Food is flavourful, fresh, well seasoned and plated artfully. 

Drinks - has a full bar which can make you anything; decent beer list and good cocktail selection. Great place to just hang out for drinks too

Atmosphere - great location and atmosphere; good for just hanging out at the bar or grabbing dinner reservation. They have private rooms for large groups too

Service - service was a little slow but this may be due to a staffing issue; the place is rather large and like most restaurants, they need more waiters. Can't complain though as they are attentive and helpful with suggestions and menu questions

Cleanliness - not an issue 

Encore? - pricey but worth it"}
{"text":"Meh. Can a restaurant simply try too hard? All the trappings of a trendy upscale haute but missed the mark. Sparse crudo portion too focused on presentation. Same for the halibut. Beautiful but dry. My recommendation would be to keep all the fine ingredients and just rework the menu to be more approachable and less fancy for the sake of fancy. Or maybe I need to stick with Urban Farmer or try Majorca on the West Side. I hear good things."}
{"text":"Before start with the restaurant, I just want to note that I had no idea there was this little street (East 4th) corner Cleveland downtown.  It's an absolutely adorable street/alley and I fell in love with it as soon as I saw it.  This street is closed to traffic, has little lights lined all the way across it and is lined with various bars and restaurants, including House of Blues.

Anyway, on to the restaurant now.  I guess I had pretty high expectations considering how many excellent reviews I read about Lola and the fact that it's Michael Simon's restaurant.  The ambiance was pretty good.  Just the right amount of candle light and dark-colored surroundings give the place a pretty romantic feel, though the background music was very upbeat, sort of techno-like.

For wine, I had a glass of their Malbec, which complimented very well with the rest of my meal, especially with my steak.  

For appetizers I had the much anticipated crispy sweetbreads and my boyfriend had the crispy shrimp.  The sweetbreads were very well seasoned.  The outside was perfectly crispy to compliment the soft, fatty inside.  The flavor was very well done, though I didn't like the texture of the sweetbread itself...but I think that might be because I freaked myself out thinking about it too much.  I actually liked the crispy shrimp better.  It was sort of spicy with a little bit of sweetness to it.  Again, the crispy-ness was perfect and the shrimp was very tender.

For our main course I had the hanger steak (medium) w/ Lola fries and my boyfriend had the duck.  The steak was pretty juicy and tender, but the flavor didn't really amaze me.  It was good, but not amazing.  The portion of Lola fries was HUGE but very delicious since it was seasoned with some herbs.  The duck dish came with some duck breast and some duck confit.  The 2 most recent duck dishes I've had (The Refectory in Columbus OH and Triumph in Princeton NJ) were both over-seasoned and too salty, but this duck dish was perfect.  If you are duck person like I am, I would definitely recommend it over the hanger steak.

OMG DESSERT.  That was definitely the highlight of the dinner.  We shared the 6 AM Special, and it was absolutely amazing.  If you are not familiar, the 6 AM Special consists of maple-bacon ice cream and a maple-syrup soaked piece of french toast.  I was absolutely stuff after my appetizer and steak, but still I wished there were more dessert.  To be honest the portion was tiinnnyyyy.  Should have ordered 2 instead of sharing.

I guess this restaurant is very meat heavy, but I think that's what Michael Simon intended it to be.  It also has one of the most extensive wine lists around town, all for cheaper than average Ohioan prices.

I definitely want to go back again, but next time I will try to go easy on the bread and maybe try their rainbow trout.  Will definitely order the 6 AM Special again though! =)"}
{"text":"Amazing, as most other reviews say. Surprisingly reasonably priced for the melt in your mouth scallops, meaty and subtly sweet lamb chops and fresh lobster appetizer."}
{"text":"This is the capital of East Fourth Street, where Cleveland's own Michael Symon runs his growing culinary empire. Even though Lola has grown from its old small space in Tremont (now called Lolita), it's best to plan ahead for a table--the Iron Chef's popularity means that it's still very tough to get a table on a weekend, even in the dormant season. Singles like myself should head right to the bar and savor a good flute of Prosecco or martini made by David or Stephen."}
{"text":"In the restaurant week of Cleveland 2012, 6 of we went to Lola for lunch. They have this $15 \"Symon says\" lunch combo special and 5 of us order it. We sit next to the open kitchen.Frankly, it is too \"open\" and there is nothing between me and the stove. After one hour lunch, I had a fever. 

Beef cheek Pierogi is delicious, covered with mushrooms and horseradish creme fraiche. The dish is well plated and the flavor is well balanced.Although, I would prefer a little more crispy. The side dish is Mac & Cheese with excellent roasted chicken and goat cheese. At the end, I had BACON (I say again: BACON!) maple ice cream. Yum!! 

Overall ,it was only $15, which was really nice deal. Despite the uncomfortable seating, I would like to go more for the nice food."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a romantic dinner in Cleveland, this has to be on your list.  The food is amazing, which you would expect from our resident chef, but the ambience really surprised me.  It's softer and more posh than Lolita.  We sat at the chefs table, which is a bar of Himalayan salt.  The routine of the kitchen is a well oiled machine, cooking shows have nothing on this experience.  Get something with pork, never a disappointment and the beef cheek pierogi is melt in your mouth excellence.  I have and will continue to go back."}
{"text":"I took my adult daughters for a girl's night out.  It was my suggestion to try Lola because I had read about the chef.  I was pretty disapointed.  The enviroment was nice, the food so so.  They have very few vegatarian options, however they do let you know that up front. I ordered the duck breast which was seasoned poorly and really overcooked.  I kept taking one more bite thinking it would get better, when I almost choked it was time to stop.  The waiter took half of the price of the entree off my bill.  The asparagus was good.  Don't bother with the french toast dessert.  I was excited to try something unique, not worth the hype or the cost.  I think there are better options in Cleveland for fine dining.  I'll pass on eating there again. Wine list not that impressive either."}
{"text":"I am the people ... one merit 5 stars.
I can lamb - 5 stars.
I can beer local - 5 stars
I can again dinner"}
{"text":"I live in New York and come to Cleveland often on business. This is the only restaurant which I would rate as highly as most 4 star restaurants in manhattan. The space is nice and airy, although a little noisy - reminds me a little of Craft in NY - and lthough the service is informal and chatty, the food is excellent. I have been here four times and the food was always excellent, well cooked and imaginative without being silly.

I recommend the cold meat sampler, I had a domestic prosciutto here a couple of times that was as good as the Italian one, almost like the fattier Jamon Iberico"}
{"text":"Pork Chop dinner was great. Wine selection was wide and reasonably-priced.  Staff was excellent."}
{"text":"A night in Cleveland, the only place you should hit is Lola. After our coats were taken, we grabbed a few drinks at the bar. It was very romantic inside, a great place for a date and we were so excited to sit down and try the eats. Waiting for a table, Mr. Simon himself walked over to a group and shared some laughs. I think I am more chef struck than I am star struck! 

At our table, we had a great view of the open kitchen to watch the madness. Bread and butter was offered, with fresh, whipped butter. Being in Cleveland, we had to try the beef cheek pierogi's. Two, dense pastry pillow filled with salty shredded beef and topped with mushrooms and creme fraiche. I didn't want this appetizer to end, it was that good! The soup du jour was a heirloom bean with fennel, pureed to perfection. We asked to share, so they brought us the soup in our own bowls! How nice that they paid attention to detail. The empty bowl was placed in front of us, with a garnish in the middle and then came the hot soup, poured fresh! 

I wanted to try a local fish, since I'm from the West Coast, so I went with the Walleye. As a fresh water fish, I was impressed and it reminded me of Chilean Sea Bass. Also on the plate was a smoked potato puree, turnip and a few other garnishes. My date had the Smoked Hampshire Pork Chop. My GOD, this was a leaning TOWER of meat! There were like 3-4 chops stacked on top of each other, with a cheesy polenta underneath. The pork was very tender and had great flavor. 

The only con were the Lola fries. I wasn't impressed with them this time around, because I had them at B Spot and they weren't as salty as these ones were! 

We were more than satisfied with our meal and our server, we will most definitely come back when we are in town!"}
{"text":"Spectacular - and you pay for it.

I was travelling to Cleveland on business and ate at the bar.  This meal was delicious with excellent service and help from the bartenders.  The bar was also fairly sociable on a weeknight at 8pm.  The food was creative without trying too hard.  Despite the perhaps routine sounding ingredients for some of the dishes, every dish had some unexpected but absolutely perfect flavors/combinations.

The food was excellent.  Subtle with nothing overdone and flavors that evolved in the mouth thanks to thoughtful plating.  I had a 'mixed green salad' with spanish almonds, apples, smoked blue cheese etc...absolutely delightful with a perfect balance of flavors, sweet/smokey/salty/acidic.  This was followed by the salmon - spectacular and perfectly cooked.  Here the plating was important...some bites had an herby citrus taste from the sauce and garnish, while others had chunks of bacon and savory potato...a delight to eat.  I paired with an albarino - a nice crisp choice, the bartender also recommended a nice white but it was a bit sweet for my taste.  I finished with the panna cotta...amazing.  Sage, candied prosciuto, peaches and I don't know what else made for a delightful, not too sweet finish to a wonderful dinner.  The bartenders were attentive despite a full bar and the atmosphere was social and relaxed.  

Absolutely worth every penny if you have that many pennies :)"}
{"text":"Now that's a mutha F'n steak.... Could smell the wood from grilling when it came to the table... Great cocktails.. Only real down side of this place is its location.. Cleveland.. :-/"}
{"text":"I am pretty sure I have been to every one of Michael Symon's restaurants. 
But Lola is my favourite.

So much my favourite that it was here that I decided to take Jessica before asking her to marry me along the shores of Lake Erie.

It is here that so much care is put into each dish, so much care into the experience of each customer.

While the dishes are often seasonal, one thing that is always on the menu (and worth recommending), is the smoked berkshire porkshire porkchop. Anytime you are at a Michael Symon restaurant, the pork will always be excellent (and especially if there is a pork BELLY dish on the menu!) and his cheesy polenta is always outstanding.

But anything you get, will be great. I am sure.
One of my favourite restaurants in the world."}
{"text":"Swanky and expensive. Do make reservations. Great romantic date spot.  Awesome wine selection. iPad wine and drink list was pretty cool and wow and now. It gives Cleveland hope to have a place like this thriving."}
{"text":"Outstanding dinner with fun cocktails (best Mojito ever) and excellent service by Dominic. We had the burrata with strawberries and prosciutto, followed by scallops and the hangar steak. All were tasty and prepared to our liking.  The banana ice cream and the dessert brioche French toast were fabulous. A fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Top notch during my visit to Lola!  Located in a great area next to the ball park! Seating available inside and out!  Reservations are encourage.  Made mine through Yelp.  Service was great!  Menu, plenty of great choices!  Beef Cheek Pierogies were awesome.  Beer choices were good.  I had the skirt steak and it was cooked to perfection!  Open kitchen concept is something I enjoy.  Restrooms located downstairs were very clean and well stocked!  If I ever find myself in Cleveland again, I'll be back to eat at Lola's!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place because of watching the food network and being a fan of Iron Chef. The restaurant looks very fancy and what I expected from a celebrity chef. I enjoyed the food but the service was pretty bad at the bar. I typically do not write about the service unless it was amazing or horrible and this time it was horrible. The bartender took forever to come by and take my order or give water even though he was not busy and just eating behind the bar. 

Food: 
Braised Rib- Super tasty, moist, and full of flavor
3am breakfast- French toast with bacon ice cream so good. 

I would go back but hope for better service."}
{"text":"C'mon Cleveland! This is supposed to be the best restaurant in town?  Most dishes unimpressive and a little dated.  Gold leaf on our chocolate?  Decor was a little confusing, identity crisis style."}
{"text":"Been in Cleveland area for a couple years now and finally made a visit to Lola-- finally!  
Awesome:
Beef cheek pierogis
Smoked poke chop
Hanger steak
Lola fries!
Gotta go back!"}
{"text":"Lola has become sort of a Valentines Day tradition. By sort of, I mean this is only my second V-day celebrated there but after two fantastic meals, I think we will end up going every year that we can.

This time, we started with the gnocchi and the crudo appetizers. The gnocchi was so rich and delicious and the crudo was so fresh and bright. Very different, but both tasted amazing. 
For dinner I went with the lamb and my husband went with the pacific cod.
I'm used to lamb cooked in a Mediterranean style as that is what I had growing up. This was different, it was braised and fork tender. The waiter said I wouldn't need a knife and he wasn't kidding. Came with turnips, which I thought I didn't like, but turns out they aren't bad if they are cooked right. Nice job Mr Symon. The spices on the lamb were just perfect, not too much, not too little. 

For the pacific cod, it had so many flavors that worked so well together. It got better with each bite. As always, the fish was cooked perfectly. We also ordered Lola fries, of course, because how can you go to a Michael Symon restaurant and not order them. Yum. 

Dessert- milk and cookies, but not really. Two blonde brownies shaped liked cookies. An molded piece of ice cream, again shaped like a cookie. Chocolate bits and some whipped milk to top it off. Heaven. Then they bought out two raspberry white chocolate truffles with the check. Better than Lindt! So smooth and just the right amount of raspberry, I wish I could have ordered a plate of those for dessert (along with the milk and cookies dessert of course).

Drinks also were awesome as per usual.  Lola sidecar is my fave with the vanilla cider being a close second. The vanilla cider had a really nice spice to it that I wasn't expecting. But it wasn't overly sweet which made it all the better. 

Overall, of the \"fancy\" restaurants I've tried in CLE, I think Lola is the best overall experience from start to finish. The service  is great, they always pace the evening well and aren't rushing you out of there. The food is delicious. They are on top of refilling water, they know the menu up and down, backwards and forwards. And  most importantly, the food is awesome. Hooray for new traditions."}
{"text":"Awesome food & atmosphere! Mike Symon even signed a menu for me.  Thanks Mike! Had a great time there."}
{"text":"E 4th Street is SO CUTE. I felt like I was in Chicago, not in an alley for sure. 

The Pomegranate and Fig martini was the perfect starter.

We REALLY loved the bone marrow. Which was a big stretch for me to eat, since its such a gross thought. I think it helps that it is not presented in the bone, traditional style. I loved the condiments, my favorite marrow combo was the pickled shallots, sprig of parsley, and sea salt. 

We had the walleye clam bake and the roasted pork, both delicious. We had to end the night with the 6am special. I've discovered I do not like bacon in my ice cream, but it was fun to try."}
{"text":"Just maybe the best restaurant in Cleveland. It's so good, that I look forward to going there even when traveling in from NYC. It's also a relative bargain (relative to NYC that is). If you're feeling adventurous, I'd recommend calling ahead to do the Chef's Tasting Menu - you won't be disappointed. The wines parings are also thoughtfully done.

Downtown Cleveland is a lot of fun, especially in good weather, and this is part of what makes it tick."}
{"text":"I went to Lola while we were in Cleveland three months ago. We decided to spend a weekend there to visit the Cuyahoga national park. The park was terribly disappointing and Lola literally saved the weekend. 

The food is outstanding, absolutely excellent!! It exceeded my expectations. The flavors are very bold and original. The food is the reason i am giving the restaurant 4 stars, as other aspects of the restaurant could have been better.

The service was just ok. At a cheaper restaurant with different food it would have been good but at a restaurant like Lola I was expecting better.

Atmosphere was nice and very private.

Price was very reasonable. I have paid more for food as good as or not nearly as good as Lola."}
{"text":"The food was good but not great. We had alot of expectations based on the reviews. The pork belly appetizer was tough and mushy not alot of flavor. Probably was not made right that night. The creamy bean soup was very gritty. The scallops entree tasted ok lacked seasoning. The shellfish entree was very good had alot of good flavor in a wonderful broth. The whole wine list on the Ipad looked neat but we could only find glasses and half bottles asked the waiter if there were other selections and he said everything was there on the ipad. When we left I noticed there was a much larger selection of wines hanging from the wall at the bar. Also surprised that we could not order the wine through the ipad it was only for show. It would have been better in a nice folder, we would have spent more with a complete list. I guess shouldn't go there on a Monday night."}
{"text":"Just fantassssssssstic! I just took two customers from North Carolina in there and they have never heard of Pierogi's in there life. I can promise they will never forget how good they are from this moment forward. The staff was amazing as well."}
{"text":"So, Restaurant Week finally brought me to come down and check out Michael Symon's famous Lola, and I'm glad I did!  I'm an avid Food Network viewer and although Symon has a really obnoxious and annoying laugh, I love watching him cook on TV.  Prior to coming to Lola, the only other Michael Symon restaurant I had been to was B Spot, which I do enjoy. 

My date and I came in for dinner on a cold, windy, Monday night.
Immediately upon walking in, I felt like I was under dressed.  The interior is very upscale and classy...worthy of a fine dining experience.  Well done on the decor, Mr. Symon!  The host checked our coats and the hostess brought us to our table. On the way to our table, I noticed the fancy bar on the left. Very snazzy!

Shortly after being seated, our server, Lisa, brought over the drink menu on an iPad. We thumbed through it for a bit and ended up just getting some beers.  The loaf of crusty bread was brought out just before we our drinks arrived.

For our meal, we we ordered off of the $30 3-course Restaurant Week menu.  I ordered the Mixed Greens Salad, Mac & Cheese (goat cheese, chicken, rosemary), and Baked Caramel Apple, and my date ordered the Potato Leek Soup, Beef Hanger Steak, and Baked Caramel Apple.  The salad was quite good. It had roasted almonds, bleu cheese, and some other things, tossed in a slightly acidic vinaigrette.  Maybe a bit too acidic for my tastes, but it was great. My date ate up the soup, so it must have been good. 
The entrees came out and although the mac & cheese was nicely done, I wish I would've gotten the hanger steak after trying a few bites from my date's plate. It was cooked a perfect medium rare and very tender.  (sorry, no pics..that would've been inappropriate) The steak came with a lot of Lola fries too.  They tasted just like the ones from B Spot. For dessert, the baked caramel apples with salted caramel ice cream were amazing...sweet and aromatic...like grandma's apple crisp.

We both left Lola with happy bellies and I would come back again for special occasions maybe.  Their regular menu is a bit pricey compared to standard dining establishments.

I will have to check out Lolita next to see how it compares!"}
{"text":"Hawaiian Poke. Citrus Acidic raw albacore tuna, ginger, jalepeno.  Very unique taste. Pacific cod with black truffle oil broth, potato, pearl onion, mussels. Like a Mini bouillabaisse...excellent. Service always good. Atmosphere usually great but stuffy tonight, very trendy usually but...  

It was a Monday night and seemed like all the \"wanna be' business tycoons out entertaining clients.  Quit puffing out yo chest, we know you are important.  We also know you can't afford the dinner here really without your business reimbursing and that BMW 5 series you have out front is 50% of your net worth.  Shhhh...I won't tell.  We love you just the way you are, you don't need to flash to compensate for the lack in your drawers."}
{"text":"Over priced food average food. The lamb was overcooked and cold when served. You are paying up because he is a celebrity chef. Many better options in Cleveland. Service was ok."}
{"text":"First trip to Cleveland and my friend says we MUST eat at Lola. Oh, it WAS good. I had the bone marrow appetizer, which I'm glad I've had now and probably won't eat again. It was really rich and fatty, and with all of the accouterments, you can dress it up any way you want. (My favorite was the sea salt and red onion).
My friend's oysters mignonette were some of the best - even topping those of the Oyster Bar in Grand Central Station, NYC. Small, but very briny and fresh. I hate to think of the carbon footprint it took to fly those in from wherever.
The kitchen did sear my steak exactly medium rare, and I'm loving the lemon vinaigrette which dripped down from the salad onto the steak. I will definitely try to replicate that at home.
The 6 a.m. special dessert is one of a kind. You MUST try it even if you're not into apples or french toast. Just because it's THAT good."}
{"text":"Nestled amidst an appropriately eclectic array of pubs, shoppes and other restaurants, in downtown Cleveland you'll find Lola, the brick and mortar baby of one Michael Symon, American Iron Chef, and its definitely worth checking into. 

I have sampled much of the fare Ohio has to offer since my arrival six weeks ago, and have been looking forward to experiencing Symon's menu.  Just a week ago I was bummed to have arrived too late to enjoy the $5 plate happy hour offered at his other restaurant 'Lolita', but thanks to my open table app was able to snag the last 7pm reservation for two, and I highly recommend you do the same because this place certainly stays booked! 
Although I'm no stranger to that nagging voice inside that says \"order everything!\" I had to consider my virgin-palated companion at the time who tends to widen his eyes in terror at the thought of tasting things that conversely make me coo.  So it was a no-brainer to start with the beef cheek pierogis (with mushrooms, creme fraiche) and I thoroughly enjoyed them and the fact that my friend appreciated them as well.  The portion size was perfect for an appetizer and all the flavors well balanced, the bread was also made better once converted into a sauce sponge.  

While I was tempted to also order the lobster and crispy pig ears, I'm perfectly pleased with the duck who gave its life to adorn my dinner plate.  Neatly sliced and crowning another perfect portion of spatzle, currants and a delicious sauce, the little quacker did not disappoint.

  My buddy shared a piece of his hangar steak, tastey but far heavier than I'm ever in the mood for.  I washed everything down with a glass of Tedechi (pinot grig?) and profusely thanked and complimented our waitress for her knowledgeable assistance and attentive service.  Ive decided that Cleveland is worthy of another visit (when its guaranteed to be above 65* outside) and Lola/Lolita will be high on my list of dinners to enjoy. 

 My only reasons to withhold one star? I simply havent tried enough! And I agree with a previous comment that prices seemed a tad disproportionate to all the other fine foods I've enjoyed in the area.  Alas, I didnt have to pay for the meal so it didn't bother me one bit! Enjoy your time and don't forget to share your 'food porn'!"}
{"text":"I hate to say it, but I really was unimpressed with the food at both Lola and Lolita.  The service, decor, and drinks were awesome at both restaurants but the food was blah.  There are so many other restaurants in Cleveland  that are SO good that I would never recommend Lola or Lolita to anyone.  If you are in the area of Lola and looking for some good food, walk down the road to Chinato for some awesome food along with decor and service!!"}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for work and we decided to go to Lola's for dinner. I have to say the food was amazing. The service was fantastic. To start we had the burrata and the beef cheek pierogi. Both very tasty. The burrata was very fresh. For my entree I had the beef hanger steak and it was delicious. The meat was cooked perfectly. For dessert we had the lola s'mores and the 6am special. Both were good but the 6am special was amazingly awesome. Highly recommend it. Lola's is a little price but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place negative stars. I have never in my life had a lowlife hostess treat my family in such a way. What a complete snobby b*tch! I'm really not sure why I didn't ask for her manager. 
Late afternoon started with chocolate martinis at The Chocolate Bar next to The Arcade. Fabulous! I mean fabulous in all ways. The experience was great. We then had dinner at a restaurant across from Lola, I can't remember the name, but it was again a fabulous experience. Fancy and polite. Food was amazing. 
Now we were looking for somewhere to have desserts and more drinks. Just wanted to hop around for the night. Well, apparently Lola doesn't allow patrons to come in \"just for dessert\", with her eyes rolling the entire time. PLEASE!!! How pathetic can you get!? I have worked in food service for over 12 years. Her attitude towards my family was completely uncalled for, inappropriate, and frankly embarrassing. I now don't believe her about the policy and wish I would have called her out via her manager. At least then I could have gotten her rude a$$ reprimanded. 
I'm sorry, but if you're going to be in the hospitality business... you might want to learn what hospitality means. I don't know, Just a thought? Who trained this thing?
The Chocolate Bar was so fabulous in fact, that we went back to have our desserts and more martinis! I'm actually glad we did because I really didn't want to leave there in the first place.  I mean come on, there was a magician!! ...and of course he was fabulous. ...and well tipped. 
All that being said, I have trashed Lola to anyone I can. How's that for advertising? Yeah, I'm sure I really hurt their business. We won't be back to ever try a full meal there. We'll go to the more expensive and polite place right across the street. Bye"}
{"text":"Best food experience ever! The steak was by far the best steak I've ever had, hands down... Not a big fans of Lola's fried with a steak but they were still good just next time I would order something else.  My husband loved the seafood dish he had and the pierogies were Amazing!! My potato soup was also very tasty! We will be back we made a 3 hour drive to try it out!"}
