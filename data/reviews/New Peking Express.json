{"text":"I've been coming here for years. It's best if you get here as they are bringing out the lunch entrees to the buffet. The people that work here are very friendly and the prices are fantastic. There's a larger buffet down the street, but this place has much better food on their buffet!"}
{"text":"So much disappointment...Aside from what seems to be glowing reviews (for an Asian Buffet), I put too much stalk into the usage of Peking...I don't know why...Either way, I lost 1/2 the 1 plate I ate on the way back to the hotel, and that will not be the last of it before nights end. 

Silver lining? people are nice...Kind felt like Cheers there for a second.  Must have some regulars who are immune to what is assaulting my innards."}
{"text":"I was super skeptical to go here when my boyfriend and I pulled in to meet some friends for dinner. I still a little nervous sitting down. But then I went up to the buffet and was amazed how many different varieties of Chinese food there was and the wide selection of sushi. And for about $9 all you can eat, you cant go wrong! Try the honey chicken! Im still craving to go back!"}
{"text":"I don't know how to feel about this place. We went there two weeks ago for the buffet and really enjoyed ourselves because the food was pretty decent on a Saturday at lunchtime. We had a fair sampling of the hot dishes and my husband, who likes Chinese much more than I do, even enjoyed the wonton soup (which he craves when he's sick.) We then came home and wrote to our son, who is moving back to Ohio soon, that we found a good Chinese restaurant near home to share with him.

So last night, the husband decided he wanted takeout from there since he's been battling a cold for a few days now and we placed our order around 5:30 (on a Thursday evening). 

Oh my goodness. It was HORRIBLE. My General Tso's, which is always the tester for new Chinese restaurants, was a gooey, soft, mushy mess that was clumped together like wet glue. It was impossible to pull out pieces of meat because the sauce was so stuck to itself that the fork flung food viciously across the room with every pull. My rice tasted like they had been in the back of a warehouse for a week sitting in the heat. The last half of the meal that I couldn't even stomach as leftovers sits in the trash today. The crab rangoon was the soggiest, chewiest rangoon I'd ever had. The filling was good, but the outside was more like thick breading than crispy goodness. The only thing halfway decent was the egg roll, and usually I'm not a lover of the cabbage inside those, but these tasted ok.

My husband got the seafood and pan fried noodles. He hated it. He only ate about 1/4 of it before pushing it away. And the wonton soup had nothing but wontons in it. We've lived all over the east coast and good wonton soup has strips of pork, sometimes small pieces of onions or mushrooms, mostly green onions in it. This had soggy wontons and it was extremely bland for him. 

Even the almond cookies they gave us for free were terrible!

So now I'm torn. We may go back for the buffet, but we will definitely not do takeout from there again. I can say we're definitely over that experience."}
{"text":"I am so frustrated with this restaurant!! I went from giving them a 4 star to a 2 (I would have given them a 1 star but for the fact that their flavors are there). Their service this time was HORRIBLE! There was literally barely any food at 6pm and the lady at the counter DEMANDED a tip...for what?! They cleared our table once and after paying $2 for a pop, I only got a glass and a half worth, I cannot believe the waitress only gave me a half a glass of pop  for a refill and no refill for my husband's water. I highly suggest to be forearmed that you are getting what you pay for...cheap price for a cheap service!!!"}
{"text":"The food and service are always great. This place is a real gem. I found them years ago, when they were a small carry out with maybe a table or two. Good food and good management, and they moved down the road and added a buffet. Another move, an expansion and it's even better than ever. I recommend the New Peking Express wholeheartedly."}
{"text":"If you are in the area and want Chinese food,  this is the place to go. Very clean place, good food, fresh and hot. Very delicious and low price. You will enjoy every bite."}
{"text":"I really like this place!

I've been here 3 times now and every time I been satisfied and stuffed haha

There variety is pretty wide including sushi, multiple types of chicken, beef, fish, ice cream, noodles/veggies, rice and other deserts. All the food is pretty good and I've tried about 75% of it, the thing I like most about this place is the food never sits too long they constantly bring out new food straight from the stove! Staff is nice and is on top of things. Dinner is I believe 10 bucks and you can't beat that for all you can eat!
I once came before closing and ate and it wasn't the best but I knew what I was getting into since they were closing, I've been non busy lunch and dinner times and they keep up on everything pretty good . 
I can't wait to come back I'm getting hungry thinking about it now haha

Good place"}
{"text":"Fantastic Chinese restaurant.  Although I've been disenchanted with Chinese buffets in the past, (I am an American born Chinese, raised with quality food cooked at home and in better quality Chinese restaurants in the MD/VA area) I was pleasantly surprised by New Peking.  It looks on the outside like a little hole in the wall sort of place, but inside there is a huge, clean buffet with lots of options.  There is some of they typical Chinese buffet fare here, but also some well made sushi/sashimi, a stir fry station and some western dishes as well.  Every time I go I leave surprised and pleased by the friendliness and efficiency of the staff and of the value that I feel that I get there.  The lunch buffet is a shocking deal and the dinner is pretty good as well.  I even brought my real-Chinese mother in law there the other week and even SHE was impressed.  Check it out- you'll be surprised that there is a pearl like this in little Streetsboro."}
{"text":"My son and I ate here for the first time this afternoon. We were quite impressed! The staff greeted upon arrival and we were seated promptly. The food was delicious, particularly the crab Rangoon and honey chicken! The buffet offered a nice selection of items. The food was hot and fresh. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"After visiting Fun Buffet down the street my husband and I were feeling adventurous again so we tried this place.  It's a VERY slight notch above Fun Buffet.  The food was marginally better but they don't label the food and some is hard to identify...especially the types of sushi.  Service was okay as far as keeping our beverages filled and it is a bit cheaper than Fun Buffet...so, if you're craving a Chinese buffet, I'd choose this place over Fun Buffet."}
{"text":"The food has totally went down hill over the past few years.

The peanut chicken is fryer oil chicken now.


The owner is a rude woman.
Fun Buffet is better than this dive"}
{"text":"I wish i can give negative ratings!!!! The WORST Chinese buffet i ever had. Not a single food item was fresh. Never going to come back."}
{"text":"would give it 0 stars if i could. went in there and their service was terrible and not to mention the people who own the place seem racist. a black gentleman was eating there and wasn't being waited on. when he went to the bathroom the owners came and asked other people dining there if he left without paying. he came back and paid and she was very rude to him. the food is average even when it's fresh but it's inconsistent. most of the time you go and the food is cold."}
{"text":"Clean, good service and good food. Amazingly cheap lunch buffet. Sushi? Well, its all rice LOL but what can I expect on a buffet right? If you want good Chinese food at a cheap price, this is the place."}
{"text":"I walked here for dinner while staying at the Marriott hotels, distance was perfect as they special a $8.95 dinner buffet!  Whoa, lots if options.  From sushi to ice cream. I tried to taste small portions of many to see if I liked other dishes as I usually order same thing:) to no avail, as I was full after first plate.

Soups were good. I liked the hot & sour, all of the dishes were good I tried the black pepper chicken and chicken broccoli. Egg rolls had been sitting a while but they had good taste. I especially like the Chinese desserts, don't know the names but they were tasty. 

I came in from 6-7 and the crowd was steady and the place was mostly full. The staff was hopping the whole time. 

The next time I'm in area and craving Chinese, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time last night and was pleasantly surprised. Sushi was yummy, and I love the hard scoop ice cream! For the price, it's worth it! Will be returning. I'd say this place, for me, is better than others in the neighborhood for what I like eating at Chinese places."}
{"text":"I went here for their lunch buffet, which was $6.49 if I recall correctly.
For a $6 lunch buffet i have to say it was worth the money but overall quality of the food and the taste was average at best. the mussels with cheese that i usually enjoy in most places tasted like a tablespoon of mayo and most of the food tasted similarly if not the same. Sushi wasn't fresh, although I've had worse. I did eat my $6 worth of chinese food though.
Basically, for an inexpensive all you can eat chinese buffet New Peking is a great option but don't expect to be wowed by the food. The food was 2-star food but the price was a 4-star price. I averaged it out at three.."}
{"text":"2nd visit.  Tried the Schezuan Chicken, Lo Mein (large), pork fried rice and eggrolls of course. Just as good this time. I spent about $20 and there are about 3 meals out of that . The dinner crowd was good and the buffet was very appetizing.  You cannot beat $8.95 for a dinner buffet.   You must go."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. The location is pretty small but easily located.

Once inside, the wait staff was a little underwhelming. There wasn't much communication to get us to our table or instruction of when we were allowed to go get food.

After being a bit nervous, we went ahead and got up to grab food. After all, it's a buffet. They work the same more or less. There were three full tables of choices, plus a dessert section, with a wide choice of Ice Cream.

The decor of the place was a little dark on the inside, but the food more than made up for it. Probably the best Crab Meat I've had at a buffet.

The wait staff were very good at taking away plates and refilling cups, which is actually something that I find very important at a buffet.

The only other awkward note I have to add is when checking out, I was told I could only use cash or credit. Debit wasn't an option and is always ran as credit. I just find that a little weird.

Price defiantly reflects what you get. Lunch special was amazingly well worth it.

But all in all, I enjoy this place and would come again."}
{"text":"COLD FOOD. We were excited to try this buffet. My boyfriend and I both love crab Rangoon. Or fatal mistake was going to the buffet at 9pm. Absolutely everything, and I do mean everything (except the lo mein) was nothing but scraps. 

I understand they don't want to have too much extra food at the end of the night, but there was literally only lo mein left. It was a waste of money. 

Definitely the worst part though was how cold everything was---it wasn't hot, it wasn't even lukewarm---it was cold. Only one small section of the buffet had steam coming off of it, and i felt very uneasy about consuming the food. We actually ended up politely paying and going to the steak and shake drive through next door. I am praying we don't get food poisoning. Will never, ever go back."}
{"text":"Decided to try out this Buffet after reading Yelp reviews. I feel duped and disappointed! Arrived at 5 pm for dinner buffet. It was obvious that buffet had not been refreshed since lunch time. Was hoping they would make the effort to do so but they did not do so until an hour later when take-out customers began arriving. Most of the food was luke warm or cold. Mushroom Beef was the only fresh dish I can recommend. General Tsao was cold and hard. Crab Rangoons were cold also. Even the pre-packaged  desserts were stale. Ice cream was okay. The interior is dark and gloomy. The server was very polite but a little too eager to clear plates and give us our bill. I just don't understand how they can serve stale dishes with a clear conscience. Needless to say, I will not be returning to this establishment:("}
{"text":"Last night we came here for the second time. We ordered take out and I'd like to say the people working there are beyond friendly. They always say hello and the regulars always get greeting that makes it completely obvious that they are recognized. I love that. We ordered three large size entrees and an egg roll and were out of there for only 27.00. So of course for that price it must be horrible, right? No it's flavorful, tender and cooked wonderfully. We're a fan of the pork lo mein, the sauce is amazing and the pork is tender. We also LOVE their garlic sauce, it is out of this world. Everything is hot and cooked really well. I can't wait to eat my leftovers! 

Just because it's in a strip mall, and looks kinda dark on the inside, give this place a chance! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Visited on 08/16/2011.  On a business trip I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express next door to this buffet and opted to give it a try.  Atmosphere was typical for a Chinese buffet, but the selection was very limited with many pans empty, or nearly empty.  Shrimp with onion must be their signature dish (it was quite good) because it was the only standout in a sea of otherwise mediocre food."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. 

I guess the tray of chips ahoy cookies was a nice touch...

I was disappointed by the display of ice cream in a small freezer that had everyone bending over into it and reaching their hands into it..that seemed to scream dont eat this...

hard chicken... hard sugar dumplings.. I'll just keep driving by next time..

$9.95 for a dinner buffet...when I received the bill..it was a piece of paper that said $22.15..not itemized out.."}
{"text":"Perfect buffet if you go at a busy hour. For example when they open until 12:30 or from 5:30-7:30. Decent selection for a small buffet. Pretty stingy with refills but they're motto is only eat what you can to keep their prices low. Good take out food too!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was better than most that I've been too.  When we first entered, my mother, sister, and I (with my 2 boys) were promptly greeted and seated.  Drinks were brought right away and were always replenished quickly.  The people there are really friendly and get to know their customers.  I was able to chat with our server and felt right at home! 

I thought the food was very well prepared and all was hot!  Items were labeled.  Basic fair for the type of restaurant it is, but great service and hot food go a long way in my book!"}
{"text":"Great value. Huge selection. Clean. Tried it on a whim, not expecting much. Was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Staff was very nice and attentive. Dining area was clean a laid out well for such a small space.  Great selection of items. Food was average. I've had better...but also much worse. Desserts were nice!! I only had the Chinese selections..as I am not a sushi fan. So I cannot comment on those items."}
