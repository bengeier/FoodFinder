{"text":"I am giving this place a 4 star because the food is great and they do it in a very special way. I mean they cooked the food in front of you and they do it according to your preference. The staff are very welcoming and they made sure that you are very comfortable. They offer you right away something to start and not make you wait. The only thing that made me not go there more often is the price. This place is not really for people who are a bit tight but rest assured that you get what you spent."}
{"text":"For the taste and price, the BBQ lunch was very good! The show definitely made it interesting and something to talk about with my friends but I found it a little much. I would rather not be confused whether the chef is giving me food or still cooking/playing with it.

But even so, overall very nice for a lunch with friends when you want to do something different!"}
{"text":"I was visiting this restaurant for the first time and all I can say is that the food is just OK (nothing special). It's not the cheapest place to eat  nor do they give you a portion worth its price. I've had better sushi and teppanyakis at other Japanese restaurants at a more reasonable cost. As for staff, communication skills are very low - they should hire a new staff that can actually understand/speak English. So if you do decide to dine here, make sure they understand your order otherwise you are going to pay for something extra."}
{"text":"They lost our reservation!!!!

Went again for dinner with guests from out-of-town for a group of 9. After the initial snafu of somehow losing our reservation (booked two weeks ahead) we did finally get seated and they redeemed themselves. All but one ordered teppanyaki dinners (MUCH pricier at dinner...expect to pay $26-50pp just for food but you will be stuffed as each comes with soup, salad, rice, lots of grilled veg and a protein). The meat was tender an tasty They way I see it, you're also paying for the show :)

Wine and beer is a reasonable markup (especially for Yorkville) and the servers are incredible...like clockwork. Overall, fun!

{"text":"Walking around yorkville trying to find a restaurant for lunch I stumbled upon Yamato. From the outside, it looked like a very nicely decorated tidy restaurant. I decided to try their lunch menu. Me and my partner ordered a katsudon. It took forever for it to come and on top of that the food tasted terrible. The meat was not hot enough, and the egg was kind of raw at some parts. In my partners Katsu Don, when he was going to eat it, the chopsticks pulled out a whole clump of rice stuck together.. For spending 16$ for rice, it was ridilicious. We expected fresh rice and ingredients, but instead it seemed like leftovers. Terrible experience, do not recommend it and would not come again."}
{"text":"they were not honest. we ordered a set for 2 that included a 'Spectacular' sushi and sashimi set. when asked how many pieces that came with, the server said '38'. when the set came there were only 32 pieces. that is a difference of 6 pieces!  I would understand if it was just 1 or 2 difference,  but 6 pieces is too much. with each piece of sashimi costing $2, 6 pieces is $12!  when we raised the issue the waitress said, \"I told you it was ABOUT 38 pieces.\" we were very disappointed with the service. the food wasn't that great either. never going back."}
{"text":"Great show. (But it depends on the chef you get!) Lots of food. Nice staff. Reasonable prices..."}
{"text":"Staff was mildly attentive (couple of calls for refills was ignored). Sort of helpful, in the typical holier-than-thou manner.

***Did not order sushi, but boy it looked good. You may have a different experience because it's in another area, which is non-communal. 

Was at a grill (communal) table. I ordered a new york strip (striploin). The waiter didn't know what it was - okay fine, I can live with that. The food was below average to be honest. 

The steak was ordered medium rare.

1) The meat itself was tender, but you can NOT see marbling on the steak!!!
2) The chef did NEGLECTED to trim off the fat properly.
3) The steak was not cooked on the side so that the fat was cooked! Any decent chef knows to do this so the fat would be caramelized. But instead, it was left undercooked.
4) When the chef diced the steak, I noticed he placed a couple of pieces of neglected fat that he didn't trim off at the beginning on the side. I thought was he was going to discard these. Perhaps he thought I wouldn't notice? Well much to his chagrin, I did..
5) At serving, somehow his mind changed and served the fat along with the plate. I tried it to give him the benefit of the doubt. 

It was a pure piece of undercooked fat.

6) The cooked vegetables was FAR TOO SALTY. 
7) This chef did not have the ability to perform the show properly. He broke the eggs on all tries."}
{"text":"Love the service, fresh fish, sushi, authentic japanese food, and teppanyaki at Yamato!

Try the Urajiro appetizer (deep fried mushroom and shrimp, breaded)

Spicy Maki's are tops in the city, firm, great fish, avocado and the right amount of spicy.

Sitting at the sushi bar is also great experience to talk with the chefs.

Have fun! Sapporo on draft!"}
{"text":"Best place for sashimi because it is so fresh. I've had the filet mignon teppanyaki dinner for three days in a row now. I love the wasabi butter it comes with. It is a must try meal! Love this restaurant will be coming back often."}
{"text":"Great food but you have to come for the teppanyaki. Our chef, Daren, put on an unbelievable show.  Honestly, the things he pulled were so amazing I thought I was on ketamine!  Fire was literally shooting out of an onion!  Think about that for a second. Then think how it could be that you're not blitzed out of your mind, cause how the hell did fire shoot out of a frickin' onion?!

May not be a date spot."}
{"text":"The sushi here is excellent, I eat sushi a lot when I travel and this place really stands out. I splurged and had the Toro; it was like buttery smooth velvet vapor kissed by the Sea. So good that if I ever face the electric chair it would be my choice for last meal!"}
{"text":"Considering it's easy to find bad Japanese/Teppanyaki, this place is solid. It didn't blow my mind, but everything I tried was good, and the service was excellent. The miso soup, shrimp and vegetable tempura, beef kushiyaki, sushi, and teppanyaki dinner were all up to par. O yeah, and the green tea ice cream hits the spot : )."}
{"text":"Have you ever seen anyone japanese eating here? That's a pretty good clue. The chefs are not authentic Japanese. Unfortunately, you can taste it."}
{"text":"Their sushi and sashimi is always fresh and well prepared/sliced. But what you come here for is the Teppanyaki. 

You can get a dinner set, with steak, seafood straight from the Teppanyaki grill. Pair it with their fabulous garlic fried rice and you are in absolute heaven! 

4 stars because their waitresses seem to be confused or not well trained. Came here a few times and they kept on getting our orders wrong"}
{"text":"Honest to god, i had an amazing time at this place for dinner. My friend and i went in to just take a look inside and as soon as we stepped a foot in, we were pulled into our seats by the amazing smell of the teppenyaki grill. 
There was complementary soup and salad to start with. We tried their sushi, hand rolls, and their grilled steak, chicken, scallops, and shrimp. Their sushi was nothing special, but their hand rolls had amazing texture and were stuffed with crab. 
When the chef came to our table, he was so joyful and laughed with us and cracked jokes about cooking. He did a couple of good tricks including the onion volcano. When he was done with the meat and the fried rice, i dint remember anything but tasting the goodness in my mouth, definitely amazing!
This place is pretty pricy compared to other places, bit definitely worth it!!"}
{"text":"Went last Saturday night and got the last regular table for two. Ordered Chirashi, and the tuna and salmon were fine, but the other fish was old, ew. I guess we looked like tourists, but we're not!"}
{"text":"Really bad services!!! Always Interrupting our conversation, and never bring our tea/water until we ask many times. Food is so so too."}
{"text":"This place sucks...and if you want more details, read further.

By far, one of the worst sushi place I've ever been.  We had a voucher that we bought from Dealfind and that's how we found out about this place.  Apparently, they will only accept so many vouchers a day so we had to make a reservation and the earliest was 2 weeks away.  Are you kidding me?  2 week reservation?  This better be good.  

The day finally arrived.  We had the assorted sashimi,  lobster roll,  softshell crab roll, unagi sushi, spicy tuna roll and special scallop roll (we were starving).  Ok so, we got a salad and miso soup to start.  The salad dressing was disgusting and the soup wasn't hot.  The salmon sashimi was way too thin and the other sashimi was ice cold.  I imagine with so many people eating here and using vouchers and what not, they're probably doing this to save money.  The softshell crab roll was horrible.  It was so salty that I can't even finish it.  It's suppose to be a bit crunchy but it felt like rubber.  Unagi was a fairly large piece which is good to some people but personally, I like my unagi pieces to be small and my sashimi to be large (they have it the other way around).  You have to bake the unagi piece to give it a crunchy texture but they obviously skip this because it was kind of mushy.  Even the soy sauce was too salty and they definitely use the powdered wasabi. I did not enjoy anything we ordered.

Food = 0 star

This place looked like a diner.  There's really no Japanese feel to it.  Sure the chefs were in their Japanese attire but who are you fooling?  The plates and such are shell shaped?  What are we in a seafood restaurant?  

Look and Feel = 0 star

I also felt rushed when we were there.  Sure it's busy but let me enjoy my food.  I don't want to feel like I'm being pushed out because some other voucher user is coming.  I don't recommend this place to anyone but if you have a voucher, don't go over the limit.  It's not worth spending extra money on.

Service = 1 star
Will I come back?  Hell no = 0 Star"}
{"text":"I wish I could give a negative rating, that is how horrible our experience was. First thing to be aware of is that the waiters do not speak English. We constantly had to tell our waiter we needed utensils to eat our food. My husband and I ordered a dinner combo for one to share. From the reviews, I knew it to be a hefty amount of food. We ordered the lobster and steak combo. Price of $41.00. However, when we received the bill,  they tripled the price by charging us two dinners and two of everything else (fried rice, soup) which on the menu is included with the dinner. Our receipt totaled to $124.00! They charged for everything, even refills on pop. 
So we asked to speak to the Manager. Once the manager came (a tall Japanese man who barely spoke English ) proceeded to yell at me that my husband ordered a lobster dinner and steak. I said yes the combo on your menu. He continued to yell at me in such a manner, that my husband got up from his seat and told him to stop screaming at his wife. What a terrible man!  He refused to credit the mistake they made and forced us to pay our bill due to the commotion he caused. Very embarrassing moment. It was the first time my husband has seen Toronto and I was trying to have a fun dinner for us and that is the experience we received. Ruined our whole night. And on top of everything, the food was mediocre. But I guess what else should I expect from a place that is doing poorly and scraping by.  The meat did not taste right, extremely fatty and I'm considering having the health department take a look at the kitchen in the back (too many flies were in the bathroom, which is right off the kitchen)!  Be aware!  There is a better more elegant and friendly hibachi restaurant just down the street with quality sustainable meat!"}
{"text":"Although is advertises itself as a Japanese Steak House, if that is all you want you might have a problem finding it on the menu.
I only have had the Sushi & Tempura platters which are very fresh and quite filling. Am not into the sharp-knives display and group table thing. They have a small bar, sushi bar & summer patio. Service was very prompt.
Only downside are that all the desserts obviously come in from outside i.e. cheese cake and the like.
A little pricy, and when you ask for some sliced ginger that want to charge you extra - very cheap as well as a turn-off.

{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Yamato to have a nice dinner out. We sat around the teppenyaki grill. The chef was doing his thing juggling the knife when suddenly the knife slipped out of his hand and hit my red wine glass spilling red wine all over my white shirt. If my glass wasn't there it could have been a different story. When this happened - EVERYONE just stared. The waitresses did not rush over, the chef stared blankly. It wasn't until I asked for a napkin that anyone came over. A waitress apologized once to me. It was awkward the rest of the time the chef continued to cook. I had red wine all over me. I did not get another napkin and they did not fill up my wine glass from the spill. We were so infuriated we should have walked out. 

The manager came over at the end of the meal (everyone still staring) and gave us the bill and said sorry and that I wouldn't have to pay for my meal. They covered my meal but not my wine or the rest of the bill. When we asked them to pay for my dry cleaning they told me they couldn't because they covered my meal and then we wouldn't come back.

We assured them we would not be coming back and I went in later with my dry cleaning bill demanding them to cover it. The whole experience was terrible and they dealt with it very poorly. We had a $65 dollar bill still. If it was me - I would have covered the whole meal and apologized up and down AND offered to cover the dry cleaning."}
{"text":"I went to Yamato tonight because of the kobe beef.  I am surprised that the kobe beef is tough and flavourless.  It is more like a USDA Select to be honest.

{"text":"2015 UPDATE: I believe the place has closed or changed ownership. Have not visited in a year or two.

However, it is the same thing every time , and this last visit, we had a late reservation. I guess because it was the end of the night the chef was board or tired or something, so he did a really half ass job. The food tastes good but there was no WOW factor. We went for my best friends birthday so I was kinda Disappointed. 

Also I ordered the imperial, it came with a really good onion soup and steak and chicken, it came with jumbo shrimp that in the end were not so jumbo. The meal was 35$, I loved the fried rice and soup, but was Disappointed with the size of  the shrimp. 

one thing that was really nice of them thou,they gave us side plates and forks for the cupcakes we brought for our friend, which was very much appreciated!!"}

{"text":"Yamato has gone downhill since I last ate here in 2012.  Both food and service were disappointing, especially considering it's in Yorkville.  Salmon sashimi had a large hair in it.  It was replaced, but they didn't apologize and still charged me for the dish. Ordered a teppanyaki special (comes with onion soup) as well as miso soup. Without asking me, they substituted the miso soup in the special and charged me $1 for the upgrade. When the bill came and I inquired about it, the manager admitted that they don't mention the upcharge during ordering because it's upsetting to customers. Yeah, I'm sure customers prefer to be surprised when the bill comes (!). What a joke. Not worth $50 for lunch for two. Save yourself time, money, aggravation, and a stomachache and go to Sushi Inn around the corner."}
{"text":"Not worth it.  They don't have many of the fish on the sashimi menu.   They charge for refills of soda at $2.25 each. You need a refill because they serve it in the tiniest glass full of ice."}
{"text":"I know everyone is talking about Guu these days (and the 3 hour queues), but my favourite Japanese Restaurant in Toronto is Yamato.  Their website does not do the restaurant justice at all.  The food is so fresh and beautifully presented and the service is consistently polite and efficient.  I love the set up of the restaurant too with one side dedicated to teppanyaki grills (great for groups and special occasions) while the other side is smaller and intimate for a nice sushi dinner or to watch the sushi chefs at work.  You can also order from the sushi menu at the teppanyaki grills.

So what's on the menu? Prices range from $5 for hand rolls to $60 for teppanyaki dinners. I highly recommend the sushi pizza (I have cravings for it), any of the maki and the plum wine, mmm plum wine.  From the teppanyaki menu I tried the Imperial ($35) with fillet mignon, shrimps and teriyaki chicken, it was all delicious and came with miso, salad and grilled vegetables.  Well worth the price and the chef was highly skilled and entertaining to watch.  Enjoy the flaming onion ring castle :)"}

It was good, not excellent, not bad.

Their Dynamite Roll is too big for the mouth. I don't like those kind of rolls."}

When it comes to sushi, there are NO lunch specials. At all.
The cheapest roll is $7 California roll, of average taste.

I would not go to this place again."}
{"text":"Great entertainment watching the chiefs cook"}
{"text":"A decent lunch spot in Yorkville; neither cheap nor expensive. Not too loud/ not too quiet. The fish is fresh, presentation good, service quick, table turn around fast. There are some unique creations on the menu. If you're not sure of what you want, there are lunch sized sushi/sashimi samplers.

Beside the nigiri/sashimi/maki menu, there is a robust udon / soba menu with plenty of options and next to that,  teppanyaki entrees that are cooked at the table.

Overall, a great little quick sit down lunch spot in Yorkville. If Yorkville is not your preferred destination, there are other Yamato/Fune restaurants around Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for an early dinner. We have been here a few times over the years but I must admit, the place is going downhill. However, I am always left wondering why this place is always packed! It must be a tourist trap. I remember years ago, the chefs would put on an amazing show. Their work with the spatula and knife was outstanding. My jaw would drop open like I was watching a Cirque de Solei on a cooking top. But now, you get a half hearted attempt at a onion volcano... or is it a choo-choo train? Or maybe it was an onion volcano fail. Our chef kept dropping his spatula onto my plate so my food was getting squished by the handle (I know I am being a drama queen, but I don't want his handle on my food cause I might as well being licking his hands). I usually get the shrimp and scallop combo. The onion soup was good. The salad was lacking in flavour. The shrimp was over cooked, and so were the scallops. The vegetables were salty. I dunno why they have to season it so much. Overall, the food was ok, but you are not getting the value for the money. I probably won't go back there in the future."}

We came here for lunch on Saturday, not so many people but still wait for a long time until our teppanyaki section began.

Sirloin - average or even lower. Do not recommend.
Chicken - nothing special just average teriyaki chicken. Personally too salty for me.
Fired rice - with egg and mixed vegetables, too oily."}

I am not in Yorkville much, if I am ever ever in the area, it's mostly for shopping and I usually go elsewhere for lunch. But this day, I met up with a friend and she was craving Japanese food, so off we went to one of her spots for sushi.

I had no idea this restaurant existed and probably would have never known unless someone took me there.  The reason being that the restaurant isn't located at street level and you actually have to go down couple stairs to get to it.

Yamato serves simple Japanese food as well as Teppanyaki at the back of the restaurant. I was surprised to see they had another seating area through a hallway and the restaurant turned out to be a lot bigger than I expected. Since it is located at half basement, the lights were quite dim even for lunch service. I personally prefer brightly lit restaurants when I am there for lunch but I guess we were somewhat seated by the window so it wasn't too bad.

We were there to grab quick lunch so I just ordered couple rolls off of the regular menu.

Ordered: Spicy scallop roll & Spider roll 4/5

* Spicy scallop roll was $11 and Spider roll was $15. The food took quite a bit to come out, I think it was my spider roll that was somewhat time consuming. I guess they deep fry the soft shell crab when you just order it which is good to know they make it fresh.
Rolls were nicely made and was presented nicely, especially the spider roll. There wasn't too much rice on the roll (which I hate) and the cucumbers were crunchy with the avocado just ripe. When it first arrived, I couldn't see how the spicy scallop roll was to be spicy.. but something is in there!
Although personally I do prefer spicy mayo for my spicy scallop roll, this tasted very clean and fresh. I really enjoyed the spider roll which did not skimp out on ingredients. For $15 for 4 pieces of rolls I guess it is on the pricey side, but if you care for quality this is probably the place for you.

My friend ordered Sushi lunch ($14) which comes with 6 pieces of nigiri and a tuna maki as well as Spicy scallop roll. Sushi lunch is served with miso soup.

Summary: Place to go if you are looking for good quality sushi in Yorkville area. Check it out if you want Teppanyaki as well."}
{"text":"I wish I live in Toronto, so I can come back here every weekend. Oh my, definitely the best Japanese steakhouse I've been to. It was amazing and the restaurant interior was beautiful! The steak shrimp/scallop that we ordered were perfect and delicious! Their complimentary soup was delicious and tasteful. The chef was kind and made conversations with us. All of the staff were attentive and kind. It was in a nice shopping area as well. Next to Louis Vuitton and Tiffany! Lol"}
{"text":"Food is average, food quantities are small, and the place is expensive for the quality of food you get.  

You are essentially paying mostly for the nice decor and environment inside the restaurant and the Yorkville location."}
{"text":"A bit pricey but pretty good food and service.

If you've never been it is probably worth going at least once for the experience/show the chef puts on."}
{"text":"Came for lunch, the Teppenyaki was very good, the chef was fun and entertaining. The prices were incredibly reasonable. I didn't have sushi, but others did and said it was fantastic as well. Would come back for sure."}
{"text":"I was with a friend in the neighbourhood and decided to check out the restaurant. The open atmosphere of the restaurant was what drew me in but as soon as I entered a waitress abruptly told me the restaurant was closed even though there was clearly two customers eating. Disheartening and disappointing. A little respect goes a long way."}
{"text":"Excellent food, ambiance, and cook!!! We were looking for a hibachi resto in toronto and this was one of the few. Chef was great- Abdul - entertaining and charming. We got the teppanyaki combo dinner which included rib-eye (or sirloin, i forgot) steak, scallops and lobster, as well as fried rice, grilled veggies, salad and soup- $46. It was delicious!!! Fried rice is off the hook!!! Lobster delicious. Meat medium-rare savoury. It's supposed to be a meal for one but we split it jn two and got some appetizers to share, and it was enough!!

I would come back here with my family to treat them for an occasion or somethjng."}
{"text":"I'll cut to the chase. 

[Good]
Our waitress was attentive and nice. 
Our chef for our table was nice, but that's about it.

[The Bad]
PERFORMANCE/TEPPANYAKI SHOW: 
Considering the restaurant is located in the heart of Yorkville, you would think that their food and service would be absolutely top notch, almost perfect. But with our experience, it wasn't. Our chef was not entertaining at all. He first did the egg spin trick but out of the 3 eggs, only one worked but we said \"AWW, It's okay!!\" :)). Then the next trick he did was the onion volcano trick, in which you would think the chefs wouldh have it down since all teppanyaki chefs knows this trick. Other than that, nothing, not even a single word. My sister, her boyfriend and I literally just sat there waiting for our food. His cutting skills was amazing but that was it. The girls next to us were really excited at first but like us, we were all pretty highly disappointed. 

FOOD: The food wasn't bad but it wasn't good. It was slightly too salty and although that may be based on personal taste, it still wasn't that great. 

Teppanyaki is supposed to be a fun, entertaining dinning experience. The other tables had chefs who did spectacular shows (salt/pepper, juggling, catching things with their hats, singing, joking) and all you hear is laughter while wishing you had that chef at your table instead. Yes, our reservation was quite late (9PM), but this business is based on customer experience. No matter how late it is, or how tired you are, you have to put everything aside and deliver professionally. The customers are paying for quality food and performance, they expect something top notch. 

Based on tonight's performance... I would not visit again. It was my sister's boyfriend's first time visiting downtown Toronto and we wanted this dinner to be something memorable. It was definitely memorable alright, but not in a good way. It was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Great service!  Bland sushi. So if you are going for service only, then this is the place.  Not that the sushi was bad, it just wasn't that exciting.

We went at lunch and they have some really great lunch specials.  We got there about an hour before they closed for the afternoon and they didn't seem too happy about it.  Anytime we asked a question, they would remind us that they were closing at 2pm.  We get it, we'll be out of here.

My favourite was the Dragon Roll but at $9.50 a roll, I couldn't justify more than getting just one.

I'm on a mission to find an alternative to the very pricey sushi restaurants in Calgary, I'm not sure if this one is a suitable replacement yet, so I'm going to keep looking."}
{"text":"Behold, a Toronto sushi restaurant where the wait staff are actually Japanese! I can't quite believe it myself either.

I don't know what the deal is with this place, it seems to have two levels, I've only been to the lower one. It's a tight space downstairs, but neat. Table being only slightly wobbly, hardly noticeable.
The waitresses were all very short, but that's not how I came to the conclusion that they were from Japan. I made that observation when I overheard them speaking Japanese. Nobody can wag the finger at me for that one.

There's not much to say about Yamato, other than the sushi itself. Bloody delicious. I don't even know what the names of the rolls I ordered, all I know is that it was worth every penny. The avocado melted in my mouth, the shrimp and crab were fresh and crispy, you can't taste the fatal mercury in the fish at all, the Sake was just the right temperature. You can almost taste the ten year hard achieved diploma of the sushi chef. 
The crowd here weren't bad either, one of those environments where you won't lose your voice from talking to the person in front of you.

I almost wanted to bow to our waitresses on my way out."}
{"text":"It's a normal , regular Japanese restaurant . 

Good : great location , service is good , not a lot of table for regular dining but inside they have a large room for special teppaniyaki which is good for large groups .

Cons : not a lot of vegetarian choices . If you are a vegetarian like me, go elsewhere ."}
{"text":"Sushi was of low-quality.  The type you expect to get in the prepackaged food section of your local grocery store.  Was expecting much better.  

Servers literally reach all the way over the table to grab your water glass.  Plenty of better options in the area.  Will not be going back to this place."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere for a nice saturday lunch. Well appointed restaurant, however the portions are bit too small for the price, and there is nothing exciting on the menu."}
{"text":"My wife and I haven't been to Yamato for awhile and thought we would take my mom here for dinner tonight. The menu looks a little different and we figured there must have been a change in management. We order a love boat, few other sushi pieces and appetizer. The tamago sushi we had was good, but we were disappointed with the love boat. I must say this is the first and only time I was serve with spring roll ?? imitated deep fried scallop and sushi roll with yam ?? Sure, I understand the yam sushi was probably part of a cost control thing and other places would serve sushi roll with cucumber. But other places would at least give you three pieces with either tuna or salmon, and the other three pieces with cucumber...not all six pieces with yam?? Not the best value we got out of a love boat for what we paid for. Food was ok and the service was ok, but it wouldn't be our \"go to\" sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"After looking up Yamato's online lunch menu and noticing how affordable the lunches were for a university student, a friend and I went to indulge on $11 ribeye steaks for lunch. 

The waitresses, clad in kimonos, were ninja-like in their ability to keep our teacups filled. It was pretty cool. 

Our chef, Romeo, went ballistic on the teppan board with his tricks, and did both of our steaks perfectly (medium-rare for me, medium for my friend). The steaks themselves were of a pretty high quality as well from what I could see, being well-marbled and delicious. Romeo made small talk with us as he did his work with ease.

My friend and I are probably going to come back and try the sushi, since other Yelpers have been saying how good it is! Seems a little on the pricey side though. Alas!

{"text":"I've always loved Yamato. I haven't been in a very long time but as I recall, excellent service and the sashimi is always served at the perfect temperature, (I consider this a very important factor with sashimi, as one should)!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner to Yamato to celebrate my sisters birthday and although the food as good, the service was not on the friendly side. The most disappointing part and a bummer from fully enjoying this place was the cheapness - they charged for hot sauce, ginger and even for the sparkler on the birthday cake (no free cake for the bday girl either!) After spending close to $500, you would expect a little bit of generosity! Would I go back? Not really."}
{"text":"On the expensive side but very delicious. The service is very nice and attentive. They get pretty busy, so I recommend making a reservation first. Although due to that busy atmosphere, it does take a while to get your food sometimes. It depends what you've ordered; they do bring all of it together. 

I usually order the sashimi lunch; it's a good portion, large slices of sashimi and very fresh; it comes with steamed rice and miso soup. There are many types of seafood and hot plates to choose from. When I ask them not to include certain types of fish (I have 2 or 3 types I don't like), they are very accommodating. Every time I go, I usually get extra fish pieces!"}
{"text":"I just went to Yamato for dinner. I have been to a few tepenyaki restaurants so I like to think I have a good comparison. There was 1/5 chefs that really put his heart/effort into providing an entertaining dining experience. My server was friendly but didn't really do any tricks aside from the standard onion volcano. I ordered the beef roll... Do yourself a favor and order something else. I personally expected way more from it based on location(prime yorkville), price and reviews. 

Repeat: negatory"}
{"text":"It was good, had some tuna & salmon sashimi along with some sushi and tempera, really liked the tuna quality."}
{"text":"Best place to eat teppanyaki! Great service and a nice staff! Excellent sushi pizza and dynamite rolls. (:"}
{"text":"My friend recommended us to try this restaurant. We were looking forward to it. However, I have to give 2 stars. We waited at the table for 45mins to start our teppanyaki section, the food is terrible salty. I mean really really salty. Lobster and scallop are over cooked, 2 stars are only given for the chef performance. Not recommended!"}
{"text":"nice place for a good teppanyaki dinner. and pretty reasonably priced considering it's right in the heart of yorkville! 
It's my go-to whenever I'm in the mood for a no fuss yorkville meal. 
Their sushi rolls are pretty good too. 
This place gets really busy on weekends and during festival season so make sure you have a reservation!"}
{"text":"OK, I DO NOT LIKE Communal tables, and loud showy tepenyaki places. 

This is 3 star review because I recognize that people do enjoy this, and the food at Yamato was good. Maybe this deserves a higher rating... But this is one girl's opinion who does not like the very essence of this place. 

Why was I there? 
My friend chose the restaurant and I didn't realize what it was in time to say no. 

My friend and I shared the Lobster tail and steak. The lobster was lacking in flavour but the beef was tender and delicious. 

The fried rice was EXTREMELY NOISILY PREPARED, but quite tasty. 

The chef seemed a bit offended that my friend and I did not pause from our conversation to watch him slam food and knives around on the giant stove top in the middle of the table.  

If you prefer you food to be prepared out of sight and sound, in an enclosed kitchen, and you like an intimate dining atmosphere, SKIP Yamato. 

However, if you like this type of communal, interactive, dining experience, Yamato was packed--which tells me it must be good-- and the service was excellent. 

This might be a good place to go for an office holiday party, or a birthday party if you have multiple groups of friends who don't know each other very well."}
{"text":"Advertised Kobi beef but it was not real. It was a lower grade American Wagyu not true Kobi. We confronted the manager, he admitted that it was not Kobi but did not do anything about it.

Totally scam!


Wonder what other misleading things they have on the menu."}
{"text":"Place is so-so. It is in a great location with nice decor, and service was good. The food was alright, got the Niku Udon...was a bit greasy and lacked flavor."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch, during a weekday, and the experience here was all positive.  The service was fantastically attentive.  My tea was always filled without being asked.  I had the sushi lunch which came with soup and salad.  While the salad was standard, the soup was very fragrant and delicious.  I don't usually drink miso soup, and this one saw me slurping it all up.  The sushi was fresh and I enjoyed every bite!  

I was actually pretty surprised upon seeing other reviewers' ratings for this place, but then I didn't come during dinner.  On a sunny afternoon on a weekday, this is a very nice and quiet place to have lunch in the middle of Yorkville without breaking your wallet."}
{"text":"I give this restaurant 1 star because I am still appalled by the way we were treated by the guy at the entrance..
We were a group of 15 people, 4 arrived at. 4:37 where our reservation was at 4:30. We were still well within the 15 mins grace period that any reputable restaurant gives their guests (coz we are paying customers, something managers at this restaurant totally forgot).. The guy was soooooo rude refused to even seat us before the whole group showed up.. Although at that point the people who were there were not late .. We even asked to be seated and be served once everyone is there.. But no he had this attitude, I felt I went back to school and I was being scolded by my teacher for being late for first period. The rest of the party arrived exactly at 4:50 which is 5 minutes later than the allowed time.. That's when he decided to take us in.. We complained to the lady manager and she kept arguing that they have subsequent reservations bla bla bla bla ( equally rude and unprofessional as the door guy-who was also a manager) our host explained to her that just part of the group were 5 minutes late in addition to the grace period so what's this act they are putting on but it was pointless."}
{"text":"I had the scallop dinner & it was to die for! I tried some of the rainbow sushi as well & it tasted amazing. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is my usual go to place for standard Japanese food with a bit of premium quality to it in the Yorkville area. Sure there's Kasa-Moto but I prefer this place as it sticks to the basics and just works on the quality of it without it trailing too far wondering if the food is Japanese or not. These are the items I ordered.

-Sashimi Appetizer: Consisted of several assorted Sashimi pieces which all was fresh and above standards compared to what Toronto mostly can offer 
-Beef n Chicken Skewers: Tender and perfectly cooked with the sauce not being overwhelmingly sweet or salty 
-Sushi Pizza (Salmon): Although not traditional I do enjoy the contrast of textures and flavors from this dish, and fortunately Yamato is one of the few restaurants that can prepare it without the fried rice cake tasting like a stone
-Otoro Sashimi: Not the freshest I've tasted, but by the majority it's still buttery goodness without skimping on the quantity 
-Green Tea Ice Cream: Yes yes, I know very common but thier Green Tea Ice Cream is actually made with some Premium Matcha powder and will taste much better than any kind you can get at the supermarket. Definitely worth trying if you are a Matcha fiend 
-Green Tea Tiramisu: One of the few Tiramisu I've had in Toronto where it wasn't insanely sweet or gooey. The overall dessert was better than I expected and I do recommend trying this dessert out.

Overall food quality is above par, the price is actually decent when you factor in the area and the quality of the ingredients. Service is alright... not the best but again not the worse. Usually my go to place if I want standard Japanese food. Not completely authentic as the front of the house staff is Japanese but the kitchen staff is Chinese. But regardless food is good here so definitely check them out.

Will I Repeat? Absolutely if I am craving basic Japanese food in the area of Yonge n Bloor"}
{"text":"Great food and attentive staff. It's a fun atmosphere and a fun place to go for a dinner. It's not super expensive or super cheap but you're definitely full when you leave. We had a wonderful chef who knew what he was doing who was really nice and entertaining! Would definitely recommend this place for a fun, special occasion."}
{"text":"Not going to go too far in depth with review because a lot of things that are going to be said have been repeatedly mentioned in earlier reviews. 

Came here for a birthday, took a while for everyone to arrive but orders were taken when everyone was seated, I ordered amaebi shrimp sashimi, toro handroll, lobster & steak dinner. 

Service was OK, sometimes staff will come and fill my water and then leave and sometimes they'll fully just skip me or another person (???!) As for the chef/show guy, he tried really hard maybe too hard but for the most part our group wasn't too amazed and at one point I'm sure he caught our drift and switched off any sort of good vibes that were left in him. 

Food was ... not that great especially at the price point we paid. Handroll I got was OK not too much filling... Amaebi shrimp was fishy tasting, slimy and I got like 3-4 pieces only. The teppanyaki was probably the worst thing tonight, other than the ($5 Upgrade) Fried Rice, everything else was mediocre at best, DO NOT ORDER THE LOBSTER, it's served over cooked and comes out very dry. Very disappointing.. the steak was OK it was looked a while more done than I wanted but at least it was edible. 

If I did not order the hand roll and sashimi as well as have a small bite before arriving at the restaurant I think I would've left pretty hungry considering everyone else was pretty much ready to hit up the next fast food joint they see. 

I do not recommend coming, I really wanted to try this place for a while and I'm glad I came for a birthday and got a more \"full\" experience versus having to come alone and sit next to strangers etc etc BUT the experience was less than memorable. 

I guess I went pretty in depth"}
{"text":"Food is good, but nothing amazing. I usually get the shrimp and scallop \"deluxe combination\" (handul of grilled seafood, smattering of carrot/zucchini, bunch of bean sprouts and white rice, $18) and sometimes a sashimi sampler ($12) to share. If you or your children are not wowed by teppanyaki cooking (i.e. some jaunty egg tossing, a halfhearted onion volcano and the smell of oil on your clothes all day), it's probably not worth it.

The clear onion soup is a nice change of pace from miso and always comes to the table about 3 degrees hotter than the interior of our Sun.

FUN FACT: While not one of my favourite restaurants, Yamato IS the location of one of my favourite moments in my restaurant dining history. A guy dining solo next to my group at the communal tables, while contesting a charge on his bill with the server, said: \"I'm the mayor here on Foursquare!\"

I kid you not! He said that! OUT LOUD! To another human being! Who as far as I could tell had no idea what he was even talking about! Oh, how we laughed and laughed. And cringed."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5
Atmosphere: 3.5/5
Service: 4/5
Overall experience: 3.5/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

I've definitely had better and there are other places well worth your money. There is nothing special about this place when it comes to eating their sushi (it's OK, kind of bland, nothing to rave about), and I often find the prices a bit too much for the quality of food you are getting. Case in point, I tried their udon ($7.50-$9.50) and I definitely felt ripped off. I can never justify paying +$8 udon in Calgary when I can make better at home. There were plenty of noodles but the broth was bland and there was little meat and veggies to balance it out.

The ambiance is that of your typical Japanese restaurant, and the service was pretty good, nothing to complain about.

Overall, I don't like this place very much for sushi and I try to stay away from it unless my friends invite me out. It's definitely not horrible sushi, but if you're in the area and looking for mediocre Japanese food then this is the place."}
{"text":"It is actually between \"a OK\" and \" I am a fan\". Actually, it should be the food is a \"OK\" but I am still a fan.

Must try :teppanyaki. 

Although, some times it is to the too salty side, although the lobster tend to be a little bit over cooked, the cooking process!! it is like a performance you just have to try it.

For people who work downtown, it is good to try the Lunch menu, although with less choices, but half price. I love the steak, like the dipping sauce too ( creamy mustard). The chicken is nice too, just I am not a Huge fan of chicken. 
 Dinner, I recommend dish with both steak and lobster and other sea food. 

I never tried the Kobe beef, didn't think there is a need to eat Kobe beef here, but if you are a fan, why not.

The onion soup comes with the combo is very nice, and I LOVE the fried rice. They chef use a special kind of garlic butter to cook it ( stop thinking about the calorie fact). It was definitely delicious (although sometime they tend to put too much soy sauce in)

This restaurant is the sister restaurant of FUNE , the sushi place. I tried their butter fish sashimi once, very very good. Some other choice other than Teppanyaki"}
{"text":"Food is good, but the man in suit who seems like in the supervisor position is very very very rude and impolite. We made a reservation at 5:30pm, and we are late for 10 minuets. He told us that we can't get in because we are late. And we can't sit to wait for our friend. When he talks to us, he even stared at me with his eyes widely open. It seems very rude and scared. I totally understand that it is our fault that we are late, but I was wondering if he could explained us  with a softer treatment.  I won't come to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Highly recommend going here for lunch! (price difference is vast between dinner + lunch) I ordered the sirloin and my boyfriend ordered the filet mignon. All come with dipping sauces, soup, steamed rice, veggies and bean sprouts. Service was attentive, fast, and the show was definitely entertaining.  Our chef made this \"onion volcano\", which at first I was confused about...wondering why he was stacking onion rings into a tower. However, BOOM, he lit the thing and it just became, well, an onion volcano. Fire spewed from the top and, yes, it was pretty grand. It's not everyday you see fire coming from a stack of onions.

The sirloin I requested it to be raw, while my boyfriend's filet mignon was medium rare. I actually liked his cut of meat better than mine. Honestly, both were cooked to perfection. The filet mignon just had a different texture, I think it was less chewy.

Anyways, if you are looking for some superb teppanyaki, Yamoto's the place. Definitely reserve!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I have gone to Yamato for years, and previously had always enjoyed the experience. My go to meal is always the scallops (which I still stand by), but after this past experience I unfortunately can't imagine myself returning. First and foremost, the waitress was so cold (which isn't a big deal, people have bad days), secondly the menus we were given were filthy, my menu had multiple dead bugs inside of it. These things still didn't deter me, as I had brought a friend who had never had teppanyaki before, and I wanted him to have the experience. 

For the food, all three of us ordered the scallops - the chef was fun and friendly as always which makes the overall experience, however the people next to us ordered ribeye, and the scallops and all the vegetables were cooked where the meat was. So the scallops, vegetables and bean sprouts all had a meaty flavor too them. Previously when I had gone chefs would always make sure that the meat items were cooked in separate spots for those with dietary restrictions. 

I'm hoping this won't happen again because I love this place, but for now I'm pretty turned off from it due to my experience."}
{"text":"This is my first time ever experiencing a Teppanyaki restaurant. I was really exciting and super hungry. My friend and I came right when they open (5pm) and we were the only ones in the restaurant. We ordered almost 160$ worth of food and the experience didn't outweigh the price. The cook was really quiet and even broke the egg while he was performing tricks. He didn't engage with us in any conversation which was fine. The food was also mediocre. Everything they made (beside the sushi) I could make at home. Nothing stood out and by time time we were finished with our meal we watched all the other cooks having a incredible performance. By all means we weren't expecting something over the top but at a Teppanyaki restaurant you are paying for the experience not so much the food."}
{"text":"My sister booked the teppanyaki grill for our party of 16 and 2 babies (for her birthday). 

Staff: attentive and always ready. From the moment we came in to the moment we left, there was always someone to open the door, refill our water and ask if everything is okay. One girl hostess was a liiiittle overbearing when it came to making sure everything was just perfect but I won't dock off points for trying hard. 

It took a while for our guests to come in but once we were all seated, it took a long time for the waiter to come take our orders. Luckily, we had been given drinks already so it wasn't all that bad. However, it was after 6:00 at this point and we had gotten there at 4:30. 

The prices here are crazy expensive but I concluded that this is because of the experience you are getting with the teppanyaki chefs and everything. Prices for entrees range from $22 to $85 for the Kobe beef. I ordered the Sushi dinner, which tasted delicious but was quite small for the price. I enjoyed the Japanese onion soup because it was different than the miso soup they usually serve. The presentation on all the dishes were beautiful. The sushi was delicious and tasted so fresh and melted in my mouth! 

They charged us $5 for holding the cake in the fridge, which I thought was a little petty considering we had a big party. The least they could do was chill our cake... 

When they did bring out the cake, they came out with all the chefs and the staff singing happy birthday. That was really nice :) 

Our chef's name was Carby and he was absolutely amazing. I haven't seen a chef like this in ages. He really knew what he was doing and was super entertaining. He also held good conversation while cooking and was very personable. I would specifically ask for him if I were to come here again. The other side of our table had a different chef and felt like they didn't get as good of an experience as they heard us laughing and interacting with our chef (their chef finished way earlier than our chef and there may have been less conversation because he didn't know as much English so I won't dock points there either). 

Overall it was a great experience but Carby definitely saved this review from being just 3/5 stars."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place more than 3 stars. The chefs really take their time and prepare a tasty meal for customers but the servers are slow, confused at times and not aware of their duties as a server. 

The sushi chefs prepare only fresh food and the teppanyaki chefs make it a fun and enjoyable experience. 

Note: if you get the teppanyaki, get the fried rice!

For the food combined with service, the price is hefty. I've experienced some AYCE with better service."}
{"text":"A teppanyaki chef needs an appreciative audience. Unfortunately, I'm not sure we provided the delight that he was seeking, despite our quiet chuckles.

We came here for a quick lunch, as this is one of my nephew's favorite places. Once we settled around the hot griddle with other guests and placed our orders, the teppanyaki chef wheeled out vegetables and trays of uncooked protein. Wielding a sharp knife and wit, the chef chopped vegetables directly on the griddle as he entertained those around the table. He even created a volcano out of rings of onions, to varying degrees of amazement (everyone) and consternation (me) among the audience. The sirloin steak, cooked in soy sauce, looked delicious. I enjoyed the scallops, served with a mix of vegetables and bean sprouts.

Service was quietly efficient."}
{"text":"really was just meh. The food was not amazing for that price and the experience was just OKAY. The cook was funny but he made everything so quick and I didn't even have the chance to enjoy my food. Everything on the Teppanyaki was so greasy and salty like chill on that salt Sir. We also wanted to try the sushi and we ordered the sushi pizza, but OH MY GOD what kind of salmon was that. AND what made me really upset was that after we finished our meal the server just gave us our bill. My friend and I were trying to chill and let the bad food digest before we head off, but I guess we couldn't cause she was literally kicking us out. Don't listen to the 4 and 5 stars review, trust me and save your belly and wallet."}
{"text":"AVOID!!!! Went for dinner on a week day. Staff barely speaks English and act confused. Very poor communication between staff. Waitress who took orders, was confused so the manager asked us and we confirmed, so the cook made something different. Said we wouldn't be charged for this and not original order (which was -4 dollars) obviously, why would I pay more ?

Anyway after 6 hours got FOOD POISONING and puked it out. Chef mixed the seafood and meat with the knife likely."}
{"text":"The cook was doing a great job in front of us, experienced, humorous and welcoming. I liked the onion tower - fire in the hole :) Although all the table had the same show.
As for the drink and food, I loved the sake, which I thought was better than Gyu-kaku. The chicken tasted delicious especially. Salmon and beef were the average level. Fried rice was good but a little oily.
The atmosphere was great for chatting and relaxing."}
{"text":"Pricy!!

The teppanyaki is definitely not worth the price. The food doesnt taste good, even the \"show\" is not worth seeing because the chief seems to be tired of doing anything. 
I've been to many other teppanyaki places in other cities, this is the worst I've ever seen. 

Service is not good. Seems like they dont have enough waiter/waitress to serve every table. 

2 stars just for the environment and renovation. 

Don't think I would ever want to go again."}
{"text":"One thing that was exceptional at this restaurant was the service.  We got served by an older guy (could have been the owner), which made sure we were looked after.  We ordered the Dinner for 2A for $44.95, which included 2 Miso Soup, 2 Crab Meat Salad, 2 Golden Scallop, Sushi & Sashimi, and 2 Ice-cream.  The salad tasted good, but crab meat is of the imitation kind.  The Golden Scallop tasted okay but nothing special.  The Sushi & Sashimi was pretty big with about 20 pieces of sushi (including rolls and hand cones) and well over ten pieces of sashimi.  Their cuts of raw fish for he sushi and sashimi are quite generous. The raw fish is fresh and the preparation is alright (not the best and not the worst).  I definitely have had much worst sushi in a lot of restaurants over the years.  The ice-cream was ice-cream... what can I say.

The only bad thing was that I found out later that their Dinner Special Deluxe Boat was on special on the day of our visit, which we were informed of.  Although I don't come here often, I think their prices have steadily gone up over the years.  That same Lobster Dinner for 4 from  C T.'s review is now $98.95 ($9 more than 2 years ago).  I am not sure when they got new furniture (since we don't come here often), but this was definitely noticeable.  I guess they have to pay for them somehow."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a tonne of Teppanyaki places all over the city, and although this is probably one of the most expensive, it is definitely one of the best. I usually go here for birthdays, or with a large group of friends, but have also gone for dinner with my boyfriend, or in a smaller group. Whether being with a large group, or just one other person, the service is always great, and I don't have anything to complain about. I've never tried the sushi, but everything else I've ever eaten here has been delicious. I always leave here stuffed, as the portions are huge."}
{"text":"Came here for the show, was excited to try the food after watching our chef prepare it. It wasn't super tasty, pretty average I'd say. There wasn't a wait time to be seated, but it took a while before the show/chef came because they try to seat the entire table before starting.

My boyfriend ordered the Teriyaki Special (mix of chicken and beef), which I was surprised to see how small the portion was considering it was $28. He told me the beef was not that great, but the chicken was decent. He also got a drink (sprite), and the server did not tell us refills were not free, so we were charged $9 for soda. We also ordered Yasai Tempura, Age Gyoza, Avo Q rolls, and Vegetable Dragon rolls. The vegetable tempura came out with a hair on one of the sweet potatoes, which disturbed me a bit. The rest of the food was pretty bland and not very tasty.

It's nice to come for the experience of the show, but not practical. Coming here for lunch seems like a better value."}
{"text":"Wait, what? Why did I not know before that there's a restaurant few blocks away from me where I can have a teppanyaki lunch starting from $9? I decided to try the place out and felt a little skeptical. I figured that the portion must be tiny or the quality must be so-so. I was wrong. 

The lunch was delicious and portion was just fine, I was concerned for nothing. I opted for $12 ribeye steak and it came with rice and stir fried veggies just like in any other teppanyaki restaurant I've been before. I'm used to paying around $60 for teppanyaki dinner in downtown and around $30 if I drive away from downtown. Considering this, I was blown away by how good the deal was. The chefs performed their usual tricks that make the whole experience fun. The quality of the food is not top notch, but bang for the buck is just amazing."}
{"text":"This is an upscale Japanese restaurant where you can choose from various sushi/sashimi/maki/handrolls, sushi-related appetizers, terikyaki and udon, and full teppanyaki dinners. 

Its all very tasty, and the chefs are incredibly skilled. That said, some of them are more entertaining than others. Maybe it depends on whether there are kids to impress? Weirdly enough, I had the same chef both times I came, and apart from one new trick, the routine was all the same. 

Anyway, food is good and filling, whatever you get. We had the chicken, shrimp, and salmon teppanyaki dinners with teppan-fried rice and it was very delicious. 

Service was a bit slow, and they gave us the bill without asking if we wanted dessert. It felt like they were rushing us out, although they let us sit and chat for a bit after we paid. 

My friend who is from out of town said this was her most enjoyable dining experience thus far, so points for that :) If you are looking for a bit of a fancier Japanese place, then this is a good call! There's something for everyone here."}
{"text":"My first time at a teppanyaki grill! I enjoyed my experience here quite a bit. The chef we had did some cool tricks while cooking such as flipping shrimp onto the top of his hat and splitting eggs on the edge of his spatula. It was a very entertaining experience and the food was quite good, I had miso soup, house salad, fried rice w/ egg, and some sort of fried vegetable dish. I would definitely recommend it here, it's a very beautiful environment too and presentation is well done when walking in."}
{"text":"GREAT teppanyaki and service! love the fried rice and beef sirloin!"}
{"text":"as far as hibachi goes, this is pretty low on the spectrum. the quality of the food is not where it should be for such an expensive, pretentious place. it's right in yorkville so you can expect the clientele to be a bunch of dicks, but i don't need attitude from the waiters too. food is below average and very expensive. masa a few blocks east is better but still not good."}
{"text":"A long time personal fav. spot for lunch.
And its prob. the best lunch deal in Yorkville."}
{"text":"Ordered the salmon ...found 2 Long hairs in my food that were clearly not mine, they took my plate away as everyone else was already eating their meals...after ten minutes brought me a new one from the kitchen ... Getting the bill I saw they only discounted 10%, I had sent it back saying it was unacceptable as I was the only one eating at the table by the time they brought me my meal...my whole group (8 people) had waited for me to finish my meal before ordering dessert ...they brought me back my bill with 20% discount and said that's the best they can do because I ate my meal and they would not comp me on it ...the manager came to me and said \"this is what you pay\" rudely....Their customer service was offending and for something as simple as taking one dish off the bill for a disgusting mistake I will not becoming back here... Yorkville is a well respected place for the customer service and high end style dining... This was nothing I had ever experienced before in Yorkville of all places. 

2 stars for how tasty their hand rolls were and how sweet the waitress was. 

Management was the reason for this review ."}
{"text":"We came here for a lunch outing some time ago.  Yamato is known for its teppenyaki experience in Yorkville area. 
The location is great, especially in the summer time, the restaurant itself is very spacious with ample teppanyaki tables, however be sure to make reservations as this experience tends to fill up quickly.
Ambiance and service was great! 

Our chef nonetheless was very entertaining as he prepared an array of meals for our team.   As for food, I decided to order their Atlantic salmon meal that was served with side vegetables and rice. (didn't feel as authentically Japanese as my sampler though lol)

I would recommend those to come here at least once, however be sure to make reservations.
Overall experience was good, would I come back, probably not."}
{"text":"This place gives so many plates and saucers  to you from soy sause pallets to shrimp tale holders. Warm Sake sure hits the spot after some bean sprout tea. The booths have a single pillow for my square rear-end on either side. The family spoon is rather long so serving the party won't be hard. TOFU with sweet chili sauce on the house was delicious though."}
{"text":"Family goes there on a regular basis. We usually order the same meal at the cooking table. The meal is delicious and the chef that cook at the table out on a good show entertaining for children. Portions are good, you feel full after your done. The service is rushed however, trying  to get you out so that the next guests can come in. 
I've had sushi there many a times and one of the best in the city!"}
{"text":"Super GF friendly place! Our server was fantastic and so attentive to my dietary restrictions. GREAT food, great service and we got to sit outside. A+"}
{"text":"I came here recently with my meetup group. We sat around the teppenyaki grill and I was fortunate enough to experience the show, as 2 members ordered the tepenyakki dinners.  I thought it was charming. One of the teppenyaki dinners was shrimp & scallop. It was grilled to a pink and mouth-watering point. It made me momentarily regret my dinner selection!

In the end, I ordered the oyako-don. Now this is the type of donburi I love! Not soupy. Very sustaining. Very delicious!

I am returning to try the sushi and the teppenyaki dinner. Not at the same time of course!"}
{"text":"4 stars for lunch, 3 otherwise.

Yamato has some pretty cool teppenyaki lunch specials, most will cost no more than $15 including tax and tip. Not bad. We often take new hires at my company here for a \"welcome\" lunch, mainly because it will satisfy even picky eaters. (You can't go wrong with grilled meat, veggies and rice)

Service at lunch is fast, you can definitely order, dine, pay and be outta there within an hour.

I don't find the teppenyaki chefs that entertaining. I've seen much better, but not in Toronto. I suppose if it's your first visit, it will likely impress. After numerous visits, it becomes boring.

They do have really good sushi here too. The rainbow roll is freaking amazing."}
{"text":"Great food, great chefs, awesome service, and clean. Prices are very reasonable for this fare."}
{"text":"Visiting from Alabama and it's such a big difference than Japanese restaurants back home.  The food was good but not much taste and spices used, was bland.  The show was nice, just like any other Japanese cooking presentation.  The ribeye had a lot of extra fat so only half of the steak was edible.  I ask for yum yum sauce and they looked at me like I was crazy.  The version of chicken sauce they have is much different and not tasty.  The service was wonderful but I did have to ask for a spoon and fork because I can't eat with chop sticks."}
{"text":"Save yourself.  We went there Saturday night on a whim while in town.  We didn't make reservations, just because we weren't 100% sure what we wanted for dinner.  When we arrived the man at the host's desk was very VERY rude and let us know ...no reservations, so I can't help you.  My husband asked when the next reservation was available, which was 9pm, and we actually took it!  We went across the street to the piano bar and had drinks while waiting.  When we returned, we were sat immediately--thankfully.  However, this was the most ghetto \"fine dining\" I had ever experienced.  There were a bunch of college kids making out, drunk, and just an awful experience. We thought for sure by the way the host turned his nose at us this would be a \"fine\" dining experience.  Our chef was A+, which is where all 3 of the barely given stars are coming from."}
{"text":"Having tried many traditional Calgary sushi places, my son and I have found Yamato to be the best in town. The staff are attentive, friendly and help full. I have taken many friends and family members that are not from Calgary, ranging from the west coast from Vancouver to San Diego and no one has ever expressed an opinion that their meal was was not excellent."}

{"text":"This restaurant I don't recommend, chefs are not trained to substitute for different allergies
If you have gluten allergy , they tell you to eat cucumber roll 
They may need to go back to school to learn how to accommodate for all allergy.
Very bad experience, first server cannot speak english and the next one was very rude to say we cannot serve anything here ."}
{"text":"This is a review for the Lunch menu only.

This place has a fantastic lunch special. For under $15 you can have a Teppanyaki meal cooked right in front of you by a chef. The food itself is great, and it's a fun experience on top of that.

The service is excellent. All servers are Japanese. Some have accents, but they are very friendly so you just have to be patient"}
{"text":"Been here a few times for lunch and the occasional dinner, sushi is OK, not top-quality (especially compared with Vancouver sushi restaurants), but certainly more than acceptable at the price level."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I came by this place because I needed a snack before the Ice Show.

When upon arrival, we were not greeted instantly and awkwardly waited for some time until I believe one of the management greeted us. He swiftly took us to our table and pulled out my chair like a gentleman. Chivalry is not dead people!

Our server, took our order and quickly brought out our tea, soup and salads.

Our Maki and Sushi lunches follow soon after, it was a good break between the app and the main.

The boyfriend enjoyed his sushi lunch very much, the salmon was very fresh, too bad the location isn't closer to home. I enjoyed my maki lunch as well, also very fresh and very well made.

The servers were very attentive, very customer forward and friendly.

Absolutely recommend for others to visit."}
{"text":"I've been coming here regularly for years. Consistently the best sushi in Toronto (although pricy) and authentic service."}
{"text":"I don't always post this stuff but had such a poor experience at Yamato Japanese Restaurant in Yorkville, thought I would share.  We had a 7pm reservation  for a friend's birthday   and due to traffic everywhere in the area from movie sets, we showed up 20 mins late. However - we phoned at 6:55pm to inform the restaurant we would be late, but they just dismissed my attempt to be courteous and said they have  a 15min \"grace\" period and wouldn't  listen  and hung up.  When we arrived, we were turned away while 2 tables were sitting empty. The gentlement at the host podium, had a  very poor attitude,  so we will never go back here again. The best part?  Those same two tables were still sitting empty 2 hours later after we finished dinner a few blocks away at a nicer restaraunt."}
{"text":"If I weren't so tired from driving all day for work, I wouldn't have my meal here tonight. I've been here for many years and recognize most of their regulars are white families in the area or who shops here. I usually don't care but today I really felt like i wasn't getting the same service being one of the few Asian patrons out of the white patrons. Service here is usually good regardless but eating alone I really noticed the difference.

My go to noodle and spider roll is still good as always. They did forget my noodles after I devoured ohitashi (nothing memorable). Sad to see the service isn't consistent as it used to be."}
{"text":"Food: 3.5/5
Service: 5/5
Location: 4/5

Highlight: If you're looking for a fun show to accompany your meal, this tepanyaki-style Japanese restaurant is a great choice. The servers were helpful, and of course chef was entertaining and a bit of a jokester too. 

We started off with the sushi sampling plate as an appetizer, which had 5 pieces of nigiri sushi (shrimp, tuna, salmon, snapper, and artificial crab). At $11 it was on the pricier side, but it actually very tasty and piqued our appetite for the upcoming meal. Along with the appetizer we were served an onion soup with mushrooms and spring onions that was quite flavourful in comparison to the miso soups that Japanese restaurants usually serve. 

The whole cooking \"show\" itself was only about 10-15 minutes, relatively short, so I'm not going to give up any \"spoilers\" of the routine. Just go see for yourself. The food itself was pretty good, I liked the egg fried rice and my teriyaki ribeye steak was incredibly tender, but everything else was pretty much cheap filler veggies like bean sprouts and zucchini. The chef also poured us two dipping sauces, a ginger soy/teriyaki sauce and a wasabi mustardy type mix that my boyfriend loved. 

At ~$15 a plate depending on what type of meat you choose, and an extra $5 just for a bowl of fried rice, it definitely isn't a value meal. If you haven't been to a tepanyaki place before, I recommend giving it a go, just for the experience. Consider bringing friends along to make a full table of 8, it seems like one of those experiences where the more really is the merrier."}
{"text":"Excellent showmanship!! 
Even though we were only two people at the teppanyaki table, we got the full show starting with the helicopter, going trough the tower and the volcano and even the train.
The lobster tail came from a fine sea beast and was delicious; the scallops were cooked to perfection and the steak was still Moooowwing, the way we like it.
The fried rice was complimented with garlic butter (Color of wasabi) and with a flying egg.

Definitely worth the detour."}
{"text":"If there's 0 star at Yelp, I'd give them 0 star. It was, the worst, worst experience I've ever had. 

We arrived at 7:00pm, and decided to have Tepanyaki. We sat, and server came, we ordered for two people. We ordered Tepanyaki Dinner special, one was Tori, and one was Lobster something. After about ten min, the server came and served Miso soup. Yeah, it was ok, we could wait ten min for miso soup, it was really ok for us. But another fifteen min gone, and I asked server how long we should wait more. She said the other seatings needed to be seated. We felt not ok, cause nobody guided us we could have Tepankayi when all the seatings fulfilled. Fortunately, five other people came in, seated right besides of us, but they did not order right away of course, but it took another ten min. Finally they placed an order. At this point, we were already not happy, because nobody came to us for water or not yet gave us any guidance. The worst thing was, the man seemed like chef started cooking, and served the other five people in advance of us. I'm not sure it's my problem, but I was very disappointed, and I just asked the server to cancel our order, cause I did not want to waste my time there, not even a second. Server told us to wait, and talked to manager, and manager came to us and told us something. Guess what he said. He said 'You gotta pay for miso soup.' I'm not lying, he didn't even apologise to us (I didn't even expect it), but just told us to pay for miso soup. I said 'We didn't get any, any guidance at first, and we waited for almost 40 min without any guidance, so I wanna cancel my order, and we need to pay for miso soup you're saying?'. I said I'd pay for them then, but now he said 'Don't pay, but you'd expect you'll wait 25 min for Tepanyaki'. Ok, I understood, but what I'm saying was why didn't you let us know at first, when we placed an order and asked you how long we should wait. Maybe I was kind of sensitive customer, but the manager here was the worst one I've ever experienced in my lifetime. 

And food is bad too man, I'm not lying, just try once."}
{"text":"It's a pleasant visit overall but not really impressive. Ordered two sides, toro sashimi, and chicken don. The sashimi is very fresh and the chicken is tender and moist, but I think they can do better for the price. Will try the teppanyaki next time."}
{"text":"Service: 4/5
Food: 1/5
Location: 4/5
Entertainment: 0/5

Took my girlfriend here on her birthday. She never experience teppenyaki style before so I thought good dinner and a show. We order KOBE beef ($80); Teppenyaki Special: Chicken + Steak ($29); toro ($27) & salmon ($12) Sashimi; Scallop ($8); and YellowTail ($10) sushi.    

Service: Servers and hostess were very courteous and friendly! 

Food: We order Kobe beef; it was like about 1 inch thick, and it wasn't the nicest cut but it was acceptable. Our Chef was Patrick, he didn't know how to cook it, I asked for medium rare to rare, he gave us well done (WASTED good beef). Sushi and sashimi were not fresh and kind of warm. 

Location: It was in YorkVille so many bars and other restaurants. Its a upscale district. 

Entertainment: Patrick didn't even give us smirk. No humor, small talks, or tricks. He dressed up like a chef but cooks like he dislike his job. Overall the bill was $220+ tip I am just glad that my girlfriend couldn't compare her experience to any other teppenyaki restaurants. I cancelled the dessert and paid and left.

There was a African Chef serving some customer behind us. He was singing and joking around with the customers behind us! Wow! I only wish, I had him serving us this evening instead of boring Patrick who F-up my Kobe Beef. 

Maybe, next time I can request a chef a that can actually cook a Kobe beef steak."}
{"text":"I think it's the best sushi place in town. Never tried another grill menu but sushi and sashimi is always fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"I don't know why many people said this place is awesome . I tried their teppanyaki  the meats were dry and tasteless and I wasn't impressed with their sushi.I rather go to Nami at Adelaide st  any-day or go to the cheap japanese joint at Bloor st. Rather than going to this overpriced and lack of quality japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"The service was okay but not great. They kept forgetting my orders but they did give us a free lobster without the coupon so i give them a pass. The price is too expensive for what your getting. I've been to many ayce sushi places and they offer more stuffs on the menu and they're cheaper. I mean ayce dinner on weekend is 26.99 so that's kinda pricey consider that  they don't include drinks on the all you eat menu. Overall a great place but expensive."}
{"text":"I had the grilled vegetable teppanyaki, and I thought it was OK, nothing particularly special. The service was excellent though -- the waitresses were very stealthy (you barely noticed them clearing your table, etc), the atmosphere is very quiet and calm, and the decor is nice. Good for groups!"}
{"text":"Super fresh sushi.  This place is a forgotten gem amongst the new row of sushi restaurants stealing the headlines.  Teppanyaki dinners are quite delicious as well, but a corner spot at the sushi bar is where you'll find me."}
{"text":"My family and I went for my niece's 15th birthday. It was what we were looking for, something more fun than the average sit-down dinner. I called for a reservation on the way there on a Saturday night and our table was ready when we got there. Prices were what I thought they would be for Yorkville and the food was good but average. There are two halves to this restaurant, sushi bar and steakhouse (which is nice if you want sushi and dont want to smell like fried food). We had a few rolls too and the sushi was very fresh.   

The service was great and they brought my niece's cake out with sparklers and a singing waitstaff, they even asked her name ahead of time. I was dissapointed the desserts weren't more authentic or homemade, like a bananas tempura. Mostly premade cheescakes. But the banana crepe was yummy. 

We sat next to a handful of Torono Raptors, which is always fun. And afterwards took a stroll around the area, great location you can walk to lots of fun places for an after dinner drink or dancing. 

Overall a very good experience."}
{"text":"I was having a great dinner, and awesome  service. They even suggested the best sake I've ever tried (Takara). Then I mentioned I was ordering chocolate cake because I needed chocolate because it was my birthday. My server asked my name, said happy birthday. 

She came back with the full staff with a fully decorated slice of cake, with happy birthday written in chocolate sauce, singing happy birthday, Renata, and a candle on the cake. AWESOME is not enough to describe. I didn't ask for this and got the full birthday package. 

I should mention that the sashimi was perfect, delicious and fresh. Thank you for making my first birthday celebration a great night!"}
{"text":"A pretty solid place for teppanyaki. Our family has been going here for well over 15 years, and well before it became popular. 

It's a great place to go, because both vegetarians and meat eaters can eat together in a comfortable setting."}
{"text":"Tiny front room for sushi lowers including the sushi bar where you can watch the two chefs creating those babies. 

At the back, a whole different concept; stove-side tables with chefs cooking right in front of you, lots of people and children friendly, very crowded on weekends (very very crowded). The manager is on top of it, the service is not slow at all even during the rush times. 

The sushis seems to taste pretty good. I'm not a big fan of raw fish but my foodie mother-in-law is a regular. I tried the veggie dragon roll; very satisfying. The gyozas are delicious, as well as the miso soup."}
{"text":"The portion was small for an average male considering the high prices for their food. I mean seriously, $170 for 4 people who weren't even full after the lunch was totally frustrating. I have to admit the sushi and maki fish stuff was fresh and delicious but too overpriced.."}
{"text":"Really fun place to eat. The table side chef puts on a great show and is entertaining and funny. Food and service are good."}
{"text":"I'd list this place as a 5-star listing if it weren't for 2 things.

But first the Pros

This is something that I feel everyone must try. Teppanyaki is definitely something worth taking a nice night out for. The chef we had was great and courteous. He did the Onion Volcano and scrambled an egg with just his spatula. Amazing just to see someone do something great while cooking your food. My fiancee and I loved it, definitely going to come back with a set of friends.

The Cons

The issue with this place is that the prices are high. Definitely racked up a lot for the meal. The waitresses don't really express when something is extra and they're great at up-selling. It's an extra $5 but I'd recommend ordering the fried rice just for the heck of it. It's delicious and watching the chef flip the rice while it's in the bowl is pretty cool. Drinks can also add to the bill and before you know it you've got a whopping large bill in front of you.

The other problem I can see with this place is that the novelty can rub off quickly. Once you've seen it, it's not as entertaining the next time. I'd still recommend to check it out. 

Definitely worth it though despite those cons. The food is great, so is the service and it's different for the odd night."}
{"text":"4.25 Stars. Celebrated my birthday at Yamato, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. 

Went with the Kobe Beef special, and wow, was it worth it! The beef was so soft and tender, and in comparison with my friend's filet mignon, it was really on another level. In fact, he was so jealous he convinced me to split with him! His meat was wonderful, too, so this isn't a knock on it. Just saying, it didn't compare, and the price difference reflected that.

The chef at our table was great, very engaging and enthusiastic, and he made my first experience here a memorable one! Everything was delicious, and I can't really complain about anything. The only reason I dock half a star is because I think it was a bit pricier than it was worth overall, but, that's subjective here. If someone doesn't have a great chef, I can imagine they feel like they paid too much to visit.

If it's a special occasion, or you've got a group of friends who wants to have a great night out, go to Yamato. It won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try Yamato since I always pass by it.  Having recently had an exceptional teppanyaki experience in Mongolia (odd place to have Japanese food!), I was determined to give it a try.

I ordered a \"Daimyo\" with fried rice (+$5), which included ribeye, lobster, scallops and veggies.

The chef/cook was a pleasant Japanese man, joking around with all of the customers around the grill.  There was a lot of showmanship involved while he worked the grill: spinning and cracking eggs, lighting various things on fire, tossing and banging random objects at hand... It wasn't exactly my thing, but I didn't mind it either.

The food didn't come out amazing, it lacked the intricacies that made Japanese food world-renown.  Most items came out charred, and tasted burnt; the quality of the ingredients were average at best, and the seasoning was very one dimensional.

I probably wouldn't go back for a long while."}
{"text":"Super posh Japanese and teppanyaki establishment in Toronto. And by posh I mean you know the place is expensive when you start your meal with hot hand towels and have to tread down two dark hallways to get to the bathrooms. In order to be get seated quicker, my party of three opted to sit on the non-hibachi side of the restaurant. The waitress helped us to our drinks quickly, though they were out of Sapporo draft, so I settled for Asahi. 

I enjoyed the donkatsu donburi while my friends ordered the steak and udon. I barely touched my donburi because the starting salad, soup, and beer filled my stomach quickly. The donkatsu wasn't really great leftover, as the breading got extremely soggy, so enjoy what you can, while you can. My friend's steak and vegetables had a great grilled flavor to them unlike my one-dimensional rice bowl. 

Perhaps the hibachi and sushi is what gives this place the extra oomph it needs and is what I missed out on. I'd love to err on the side of four stars but what I received was not what I was expecting for the price that I had paid. Until next time, Yamato."}
{"text":"I haven't eat anything yet, but seriously I can only give 1 star because the male receptionist with glasses is so RUDE! We booked 5:30 for a table of 5, and we are late for 10 mins. Then the men was so angry at us, and don't let my friend's get the table until I am arrived. He said he need to let other guests to get in first, but we are late so we can't get in! I don't understand why his attitude is so bad and couldn't even explain to us gently!
I won't come to this restaurant anymore, I hope their food is good thou."}
{"text":"Came here with my family to celebrate my mom's birthday. Here's how it fared...

The service: swift once we actually got our server's attention (not always easy towards the end of the night but it was crowded so excusable).

The food: the onion soup that came with our tepanyaki meals was delicious! The salad was kind of bland. The fried rice was just okay. The steak just good, and the salmon and chicken very good. 

The cooking show: The chef at our table, Oliver, was pretty good. He made a few jokes and was very polite if a little too quiet for our liking, especially since just one table away, another chef was singing and joking away while cooking the entire time. 

The price: this came as a bit of a shocker to me, almost $200 for a family of 4. Not sure it's worth this much.

The verdict: while overall, it was an enjoyable experience, I'm not sure I'd repeat it again soon because of the price. I'd give it a 3.5/5, rounded up to a 4/5."}
{"text":"Yamato used to be one of my favorite places but the latest visit was disappointing and unpleasant.  We were the 2nd table fully seated during lunch time.  We had to wait for a long time for the chef.. thank goodness none of us had to rush back to work.  The chef had an odd sense of humor in a condescending way and cooked halfheartedly while chatting with only one customer and ignoring the five of us.  The quality of the food has gone downhill while prices have gone up. The portion size got smaller as well.  I wanted my sirloin medium and it was salty and well done to the point it was dry (luckily there were dipping sauces).  The only saving grace was the waiter was very pleasant and attentive with a big smile all the time. 
Not sure I will ever go back again."}
{"text":"Best teppanyaki in Toronto by far. The chefs put on a great show. The sushi and sashimi here are also top notch. The onion volcano here is best ever"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at Sushi Inn and go there for lunch once or twice a week as I work in the area. I thought I'd try Yamato for a change. 

I loved the food!! The fish was very fresh and delicious. The tea was very good as well. It may soon become my new fave sushi place now (sorry Sushi Inn). 

I ordered the sushi lunch and tobiko sushi. I usually am not a fan of tuna at sushi places but it was so fresh here that I loved the tuna. The tobiko was also good.

I highly recommend Yamato and can't wait to try it again."}
{"text":"Food is nice and fresh, ordered sashimi lunch and teppanyaki scallop, worth the money. The rice that came along is a bit dried, take the sauce from teppanyaki to pair with it will do the compensate the dryness"}
{"text":"Horrible place! Worse service I've ever experienced and the most unbelievable service and actions shown my manager. They screwed up on the bill which was clearly a misunderstanding by both parties. No one there speaks English. The manager comes and gets in customers face yelling. Food was nasty too. Horrible place to go when you're visiting from out of town and trying to enjoy your weekend!  0 stars"}
{"text":"This is another restaurant that I frequent on a consistent basis in Toronto, especially for Japanese food. 

I always go for the Teppanyaki at Yamato, because eating it such a fun dining experience. The menu mainly consists of a meat, coupled with some vegetables and fried rice. The chefs are extremely fun and do all sorts of tricks with the cooking utensils: I'm talking about knife flips, onion pyramids and lots and lots of fun flames. 

This place definitely lighted up the bit of a pyromaniac in me. 

The quality of food is excellent, but I would say it is more on the oily and overly-saucy side. Every time I dine here I make sure to emphasize that I want to close-to-none or minimal sauce. Another downside of this restaurant is that it takes a while to serve, especially if you have to wait for other tables before the Teppanyaki chef starts cooking, so I would not recommend coming here if you are in a rush for time. 

I really enjoy their take on the miso soup. It's a bit more tofu-based than regular miso soups. 

The price is on the steep side, but this really is expected of any quality Japanese restaurant (especially knife-flipping restaurants, I would imagine they spend a lot of money on insurance for the chefs...). 

I asked the chef where he learned his skills one time, and he facetiously answered \"University in Toronto\". \"U of T?! \", I exclaimed. 

\"Nah, University of Youtube\"

I'll give you 5 stars just for your humour, thanks for making the dining experience so fun."}
{"text":"Went there for the tepanyaki, but I also ordered the 'Mountain' Roll abd it was pretty good. But to their highlight the tepanyaki, the meat was dry and everything tasted very salty. Not worth the amount I paid at all"}

Cant wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I went here many times for their teppanyaki lunch. Menu is great and there are many choices you can choose from. I personally like the rib-eye steak the most ($12). Surprisingly, their prices are very reasonable given that it is located in Yorkville. Lunch combos are ranging from ($10-$17 per person)."}
{"text":"very good and fresh sushi (though could be served a little bit colder). good staff, but the waiter was a different one at each time (so not an individualized experience). classy (much more than the usual Japanese street restaurant) and quiet, and with good and reasonnable prices. Dessert menu must be improved."}
{"text":"My favourite teppanyaki and sushi house in the city.  

For teppanyaki, this is the best.  Much better than Memories of Japan or Benihana.  If you go for teppanyaki pay the extra $3 and get the fried rice, THIS IS A MUST.  I am a fan of the Imperial (steak, chicken & shrimp) but all the teppanyaki is quality.  If you sit at the cooking tables be prepared to smell like your food, so don't wear your your best clothes if this is an issue.  Note that you can sit on the other side of the restaurant (tables/sushi bar) and still order teppanyaki.  They will plate it and bring it over.

The sushi IMO is among the freshest in Toronto.  As good if not better than Japango or Asuka.  Big fan of the spicy tuna rolls, salmon sashima, sushi pizza and shrimp tempura.  Other non sushi dishes which we frequently enjoy include he urajiro (deep-fried shiitake mushroom stuffed with minced shrimp & green onion), tempura, gyoza, hotategai (scallops), beef tartare, miso soup, and seaweed salad,  The banana crepe for desert is also a nice touch.  

I love this place and find the staff to be friendly and attentive.  The hot sake is a nice addition to any meal.  I have dined here at least a dozen times in the past year."}
{"text":"We were trying to find a lunch place in Yorkville and walked past this place by co-incidence. I haven't had much good Japanese food here in Toronto (seems like it's only Ramen and sushi here). I'd like to say this was amazing - as good as being in Japan!

Not sure what is it but it feels like it has some Feng Sui feel about it. Very calming atmosphere, polite and welcoming staff. If you are seated at the front, the sushi chefs are right beside you. We ordered the Katsu-Don and Tempura Soba. It was mouth watering, even the cold tap water with a slice of lemon was a little treat. The slightly runny egg, onion and chicken are all seasoned well and the flavours (Katsu Don) just all melt together. My partners Soba noodles had great texture, it wasn't gluey like other places and the soup was delicious.

Service was really friendly and quality was great. It's a little splurge but doesn't break the bank. Highly recommended this place for authentic Japanese food."}
{"text":"I went last Friday for an early dinner. We sat at one of the tables in the back that are for Teppanyaki and got a show. We also got a few sushi rolls to share. The sushi was really amazing, and the Teppanyaki was amazing. I got the shrimp and scallops one. I was really blown away by the scallops, I want them right now that I'm thinking about them... They give you a lot of food! And, they give you a little soup to begin that I was expecting to be miso, but they put their own twist, it's a similar soup that has a bunch of mushrooms in it, it was a nice surprise. The service was A+ and the bathrooms are really nice. I want to go back."}
{"text":"Strolling around Yorkville looking for food, Yamato is like a magnet!! I got suck in when I saw the 3 sushi chefs working so busy at the sushi bar.

Sushi Sampler ($11) and Tempura Udon ($14) were both nicely done!! Especially the Udon which has a tasty Dashi broth, udon cooked to perfection soft and chewy at the same time!

Service was polite and a little distant. 

I would definitely drop by Yamato again when I am in the area for their lunch specials...."}
{"text":"I was working on a Sunday which is close to Yorkville, so stopped in here to have something to eat with that special someone. First impression was not that great. Inside décor is not really on the Yorkville level and the service was extremely slow - however, we didn't make a reservation and we were only 2 - they waited till they sat down 3 other couples and then we got started - we probably waited 35 to 40 minutes before we had a chef.... 

Now on the actual food level, I'd give this place a 3 out of 5 - I have had teppanyaki in Okinawa where it originates and it would make this place look like McDonalds. With that said, our chef was extremely entertaining and fun. For that reason alone I'd recommend this place for a group that wants to experience Teppanyaki for a reasonable price - you can get a terriyaki beef/chicken for $28 - comparatively in Japan would pay at least 3 times that.... so good value... 

Anyways, would recommend it for those who want to try it and have a fun night out, however, if you were looking to the best place in town, I'd suspect Benihana would be better than here."}
{"text":"It was my first time visiting and it was pretty amazing! I took my boyfriend there because I wanted to do something special for him for being so great (place is meh expensive). So we sat for teppanyaki, and the entertainment was pretty good, the kids in the other table loved it most. I ordered the fillet mignon, and it tasted like heaven, along with the garlicy fried rice. The portion was pretty big, I had to take some to go, and the stir fry veggies were great. Overall I would go there again."}
{"text":"The price was quite cheap, compare with the same fan restaurant in Beijing . also the Japanese waitress was pretty nice. Only the girl which lead us to our seat , was so so so impolite with her manner , the same ugly face treated us as she treated as same people those come from continent of China . I was very annoyed when she help her colleague order our neighbors the other Chinese poor guy, she was so inpatient interrupted their asking. And mentioned our orders several times! That's incredible! And very very rude! Maybe she forget her behavior in Canada that she learned back her college ! 
The end of complain is the steak and veggies were burnt , and fried rice was not salty. 
I won't come agin as I promised to my husband!"}
{"text":"We got the teppanyaki here. Prices were very reasonable at lunch. Portions were decent. The chef put on a nice show and was friendly. Ingredients used were very high quality including the jumbo scallops which were perfectly cooked. Service was very quick and came frequently to refill water. Honestly no complaints that I can think of!"}
{"text":"I took my fiancee and his friends here for his birthday [and to celebrate our engagement less than 4 hours prior] . the staff were amazingly accomodating with allergy information up front, and made us feel welcomed the entire time. I've heard people say that it's a bit pricey, but if you're going to a hibachi grill you need to expect to pay for good food and a good performance. I felt like I should have been paying them more for how well they treated us"}
{"text":"Enjoyed an early dinner ,7 pm, for four people. Made a reservation and although it wasn't that busy when we arrived it was crowded at 09:30 when we left.
     Had a traditional teppanyaki dinner. Started with sushi which was extremely fresh and yummy. The wait staff, especially our hostess was extremely attentive and we all left commenting amongst ourselves how wonderful the evening was.
     Will definitely return."}
{"text":"My friend and I sat at a teppanyaki table. It's nice. It's something different.

We started out by sharing a urajiro appetizer - deep-fried stuffed mushrooms. Yum! Then we shared a spicy tuna roll and one of the combination dinners cooked at the table, the Imperial (teriyaki chicken, shrimps and filet mignon.)

The food experience and the service was all very good. My only gripe is that when you pay using their card machine, this is one of those places that predesignates the tipping percentages and in this case the choices start at 18%. First of all, I don't like to be told what to tip. Secondly, and more importantly, I generally don't tip on the tax portion of the bill. But seeing as the chef came out and put on a bit of a show (and he deserves a tip too), I let it go this time."}
{"text":"Last evening, we decided to try the Lobster Dinner for 4 for $89.95 -
- 4 crab salads
- a fairly big order of tempura & dipping sauce - 4 shrimps, 2 yams, 1 squash, 1 green pepper, 1 zuchinni that I could remember
- 4 miso soups with Lobster
- huge order of sushi/sashimi - 2 platters - 1st platter: sashimi - marinated & smoked baby octopus, 4 tuna, 4 salmon, 4 scallops, 4 shirmps, 4 squids, 2 hamachi, an upside-down lobster tail with raw lobster pieces - the best for me - lobster, salmon (huge pieces!),  octopus, scallops - 2nd platter - most of the nigiri and the rolls - one maki roll, salmon sushi, salmon and tuna nigiri, 2 sharks fin/jelly fish nigiri, 4 masago sushi (roe), 2 hamachi sushi.
- 2 orders of Yakisoba - chicken teriyaki - the waitress suggested one to eat in the restaurant and the other to take home?  We were delighted that she offered that to us 'cos we were getting really full.  
- Ended with 4 icecreams - chocolate or vanilla - green tea is $1 extra.

We also order some extra salmon sashimi and 2 of the special scallops sushi because they are soooooooo gooooooood!!!

We had reservations for 5 p.m and by 5:30 p.m., the place was 3/4 full!  The place was hopping!! 

I have to say, the wait staff is way more attentive and the sushi guys whip those sushi/sashimit as fast they can.  Tons of takeout were done while feeding the restaurant."}
{"text":"I'll give them this - no one can say that they are understaffed. Very helpful and attentive servers. I suspect that the first one wanted to be sure that he understood my allergies because he sent a second one to verify them, which was much appreciated. The teppanyaki may not be as exciting a show as at other places, but the food is just as tasty and the portions are huge. Prices are within the range for this type of establishment and are almost reasonable in this neighbourhood. The teppanyaki dinners range from $22 for vegetable up to $45 for lobster. The online menu has other teppanyaki options including individual dishes, but they weren't on the menu that we were shown. Had they been, we would have picked one of the individuals ones over the full dinner.

The five-piece sushi sampler was quite good ($11). Mixed shrimp and veggie tempura was crispy and light, although the tempura mushroom was a bit of a miss.

Hot towels to start the meal are a nice touch. The décor is a bit dated. Seating options are the sushi bar, regular tables and teppanyaki tables. The resto is located in Yorkville - one block west of Bay and 1.5 blocks north of Bloor. It's downstairs on the west side of the street."}
{"text":"I went here last night to celebrate my birthday with the boyfriend. We were greeted by a bunch of waitresses (good first impression!). She took us to the teppanyaki area and we got a private table while the table across from us was jam-packed (yay for privacy!). Our waitress was very attentive. We ordered two green tea and she always came by to check on us and see if we needed a refill (yay for attentiveness!). 

Move on to the dinner part. I ordered the teriyaki special (sirloin AND chicken) for $26 and the boyfriend got the sirloin for $29. And boy, the portions were pretty big, especially for mine. All teppanyaki dinners come with a side of onion soup, house salad, grilled veggies (cooked together with the meat of your choice), and steamed rice. You can order fried rice (pay extra, of course) and the chef will make it in front of you (that's when you get the egg-and-spatula action!). The food was good, except it got cold very fast. My sirloin strips hardened after 15 minutes, so I had to soak them with the sauce. But the taste wasn't bad at all. Besides, I went there for the experience, not so much the food :p

Speaking of experience, it all depends on the chef you get. We got a fairly young chef (perhaps a newbie?) and he was very quiet throughout the cooking process. I came in and expected a chatty, entertaining chef. You know, like the ones you see on Food Network :p Our chef was very quiet, he didn't explain about the different dipping sauces and he almost screwed up the onion volcano trick. That's the most disappointing part of the night. The chef at the next table was much older (probably in his 50s). He was very chatty and made jokes every now and then. And he nailed the onion volcano ;)

We also ordered Urajiro (mushroom tempura with fillings) as our appetizer. I expected it to be awesome (because I love mushroom) but the fillings were a bit undercooked (IMO), especially the shrimps. Not sure if they meant it to be that way, but it's definitely not my cup of tea.

So anyway, our bill came out to about $80 (incl. taxes & tips). Not bad for a birthday dinner at Yorkville :)"}
{"text":"We arrived 10 minutes later than the time for our reservation. The manager-like server told us we couldn't get our table because we were late. He said in a very indifferent attitude, leaning on the wall and having no any expressions on his face. Then he just walked away and totally ignored us. We didn't know if we should wait for next table or the reservation was already cancelled. Then we asked him if our reservation was cancelled, then he said we couldn't get the table because we were still waiting for our another friend, we could only get the table once everybody was there. He said it was because we must take order together. Then why didn't he tell us at the beginning? His attitude was very very offensive and indifferent. He had no hospitality at all."}
