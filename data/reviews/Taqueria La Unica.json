{"text":"Of the many Mexican restaurants around to choose from, this is definitely the best. I've never had a meal from La Unica that I didn't enjoy. Lately I've been on a taco kick - I love their shredded beef tacos & their carne asada tacos - authentic with cilantro & onion on soft corn tortillas. They also have some of the best horchata."}
{"text":"The BEST mexican food on this planet!!  Our favorite.....their rendition of salsa verde!"}
{"text":"Great experience, great food!  First, 5 salsas for your chips and queso!?!?!  Whoa...and each is unique, so you can get just the right flavor.  Second, refritos (refried beans) done right!  My girls and I all noticed that.  Flavorful food done well.  Just ignore that it is in a light industrial area...get over yourself.  This place is well worth it."}
{"text":"This is hands down the BEST Mexican restaurant around!! The food is excellent with plenty of flavor! I love the nachos, the tacos, the burritos, and the spinach dip is amazing - and I don't even like spinach!! The chips and salsa are really good. They give you a mild and hot salsa, which taste freshly made. Both have great flavor. I prefer to mix them because the hot is REALLY hot (to me) but still very good!! The service is fast and the servers are very friendly! They recently remodeled and it really cuts down on the wait times. Great atmosphere and great food!!"}
{"text":"In my opinion this place is very over priced.  They are the only Mexican restaurant in the area and they know it.  The people are very nice and the service is decent. I guess if your out in the country and your hungry for some Mexican this place will do."}
{"text":"They recently changed their chips and now they're not even close to being as good as the chips before. Still the best Mexican restaurant in the Charlotte area.  One if my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"I often travel to the west coast and eat my Mexican food there due to most of it being Americanized in NC. This place has AMAZING, authentic food. Servers have always been nice and helpful. The guacamole is delicious, other than that I always get the tacos and they've always been amazing. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte, absolutely my favorite Mexican restaurant in charlotte."}
{"text":"Kristy M. is ABSOLUTELY right.  However, on a positive note, they have a nice variety of salsas at the beginning of the meal, but the service is really bad.  The server came to check on me after I'd finished the meal.   That was the only time.  The food was mediocre.  Although it's a chain, Azteca has much better food, service and atmosphere.   I wanted to like this place since it's closer to me, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Food is really great. Always enjoy it...until yesterday when I went to pay and noted the sanitation rating of 82.5. I almost lost said lunch. You know how hard it is to get an 82.5?  I won't be going back for health reasons alone until they fix that grade."}
{"text":"GREAT. Eat her at least once a week, usually more. Authentic and VERY reasonable. You get 6 dips with your basket of free chips to start with. Tacos are $1.70 each so with water you're in and out for less than a fiver and you ate at least $10 bucks worth of free chips and salsa!!!!! DAMN!!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is great and one of the best mexican restaurants in the area, amazing tacos breakfast quesadilla and mole de puerco... Its frequently very busy and you may have to wait.  My only problem with La Unica and the reason for dropping a star is they frequently mix up the mole and you get chicken instead of pork. The pork is amazing, the chicken while still probably better than any other food in the area is still not as good as the pork.  I recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Very fast, very friendly, very tasty. Loads of flavor, from the fresh salsa to the chimichangas and flautas. The chicken was moist, not overcooked. Made with quality queso. Guac, beans and rice were just okay, but the main courses more than made up for that. We'll definitely be back next time we're looking for Mexican on the SE side of Charlotte."}
{"text":"I absolutely used to love the food here! The burritos and tacos are to die for and their rice and salsa are prime. However, my family disagreed with me the first time after we went and now I see why. It made their stomachs upset, but it didn't affect me and I decided to keep going.  One day while eating I excused myself to go to the restroom and while I was washing my hands I saw an employee walk out of the stall and leave without washing her hands. Gross!!  I'm wondering if this is the reason they only got a 96% on they're sanitation rating (which is pretty bad considering everywhere else I've eaten doesn't have less than a 98). Hopefully the rest of the staff doesn't do this but I'm not taking anymore chances! Especially since the last time I ate there it didn't agree with my stomach, nor my brother's.   I just wish I could have a look in the kitchen to see how \"clean\" it really is!"}
{"text":"From the outside, this is a small place, on a lesser travelled road, so will be missed if you are not exactly looking for it.  Parking: It is in a small plaza. So parking space was ok.  Wait Time: Most of the times, I have been to here for lunch. Never had to wait.  Food: Everyone gets Nachos, 3 types of fresh salsa and pico de gallo for free while waiting for the main course. I have been to mexican restaurants but never got this much selection anywhere else. Food is very tasty and portion sizes are quite huge.  Ambience: Normal. Proportional to the price  I loved this place. Will like to try it every time I am going to be around the area."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is fast, and the salsa and chips are good. My orders are never complex but I've never had a problem with service.  My only complaint is that they are a Pepsi restaurant (usually that's a deal breaker for me) but they get the food right, fast, and reasonably priced so I overlook it and get a water."}
{"text":"ODiosMio, put some Mexican jumping beans in your pants and hop on over here! This is a place we will make a point to drive past several other Mexican places to get our Mexican on!  We were told to try this place and we are glad we obeyed.  Three types of delicious salsa and a queso dip for the chips are on the casa! No, you are not going to be wowed by the decor and the service might speak  broken English but I would bet my last  sombrero wearing donkey, you will enjoy this food if you are looking for Mexican here in Charlotte.  We all shared a chorizo quesadilla GOOD!  My dish was fajitas La Unica. It was a hot fajita plate OVERFLOWING with shrimp(not the small ones you want to throw back in the ocean) chicken, beef, and chorizo. Some of the Mexican restaurants here should observe and learn.  The chorizo,  tiny bits incorporated in the dish which made for some tasty fajitas. Now after saying that, the only thing I might leave out next time and this is my preference, is the beef. It was to tough for my gringo taste buds but I do know that this is the way Mexicans prepare the beef. From what I have been told and have seen in the past, they like their beef dead, real dead. So I can't bust them for cooking what I assume is authentic Mexican. If I leave that out next time I would not miss it and would enjoy this dish just a much.  I was amazed at the portion, every one's plate, but mainly mine. If you are a fajita lover( yes some might say this is americanized Mexican) like me, you will not be disappointed here. More of the good stuff (I.E. seafood and poultry) rather then loaded up with peppers and onions as fillers.  Everything we had was good! I absoluty love those grande *scallions* they serve with the tacos.  I see there are a few places that share this restaurant name. Anyone  been to all to compare? I am curious if they are all the same as we were pointed in this direction specifically.  You want CHEAP authentic Mexican, I suggest here."}
{"text":"foood is really good, the weekends can get really noisy!! and crowded! the chips and salsa arent good and the only wone that is good is to spicy, people like it cause they give you free cheese dip but even that isnt good, you get like 5 waiters and you dont know who to even ask when you need something, including your check."}
{"text":"they have delicious food!  yumm!  my hubby and I got their fried fish, shrimp, and barbacoa tacos and come back for these everytime!!!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at La Unica for many, many years, since the Central Avenue location opened . I have eaten at numerous locations. Love the Indian trail location.Big, clean, and always fast service. And of course, the same great food as always."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price.  Friday night-  5:00pm, dinner  Food:  You start off with complimentary tortillas and two sauces one mild, one spicy. The excellently made Chicken Fundido is highly recommended! Good portions. Great food specials, combos. Made to order. Fresh.   Service: Was great. The place was very busy, however our server was able to give our table a fair amount of attention. Food came out at a reasonable time and was correct.  Did not have to ask for refills on drinks. Did not have to ask for anything. Well done!   Price: Best value and great food for the price in the area for Mexican. Most entrees under $10. Also combo deals, lunch specials.    Other: The place is very busy during dining hours. Because it is very busy, parking has become an issue. The restaurant is placed along a strip of other stores. Some of these stores have blocked off parking areas for their customers only (not that they have many customers as it is). By doing so, the limited parking during peak hours, have become even more limited!    Tip: Try getting there early on weekends in order to beat the rush and also to find a parking spot.   La Unica is the reigning Mexican Restaurant champ in Indian Trail."}
{"text":"Delicious food. As authentic as we have found. I was encouraged by the reviews that said they were disappointed that this was not Tex-Mex cuisine. Those are usually a good sign to us. We aren't the usual quesadilla crowd."}
{"text":"I can't understand why this restaurant has such good reviews.  First of all if a Mexican restaurant doesn't have good salsa, run . . . which is what I wish I had done. The salsa tasted like chili out of a can - the hot was dark and the mild was red, which proves it is canned salsa because the hot would have been red too if it had been homemade.  I ordered a shrimp chimichanga and it was small.  The shrimp were cut in small pieces and actually looked like chicken and they charged me $1,50 more than the chicken & beef chimichangas on the menu.    I think I will stick with Mi Pueblo in Matthews where their salsa is homemade and the shrimp chimichanga has full size shrimp inside and the chimichanga is big."}
{"text":"They have the best chimichangas. I have eaten there several times and the consistency is great. Whether it is take out or dine it, the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town - hands down. Always friendly service- always packed (for good reason)- the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is always packed every time we pass by so we decided to try it for dinner tonight. It was some of the best Mexican food we have ever had, even the rice tasted good. The place was clean and the customer service was great. The food came out  extremely hot, fresh out of the oven. We will definitely go back soon!"}
{"text":"Always delicious and fresh food. Great service with a family atmosphere. Be advised however they do not serve alcohol here so not a great place for drinks. Otherwise always delicious!"}
{"text":"This is where local Mexicans go for a taste of home.  Sit down to some amazing and free salsa (3 or 4 styles) and you are on your way.    Worth the drive.  Don't let the holes in the parking lot scare you.  Not the same as the La Unica in Indian Trail.  This is another level of exellent."}
{"text":"Often crowded, and for good reason - fresh ingredients and hearty portions at great prices. The servers are all friendly, helpful, and easy to get along with.  Their menu isn't as expansive as other Mexican restaurants, but their quality beats quantity. Fajitas come out sizzling, the meat is tender and juicy, and vegetables are cooked to just the right level of crispiness. Great place to relax and hang out."}
{"text":"La Unica is my favorite Mexican restaurant, from the chips to the main menu everything is enjoyable. The food is super authentic and cheap, employees are friendly. Only recommendation is to update the parking lot; is a mess."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Always a favorite. Great service and delicious food - especially if you are a vegetarian!! :) you can substitute cheese or beans for most of the meat dishes. Never been disappointed and definitely makes you come back again and again. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"AUTHENTIC is the right word to use about this place. If you want Mexican cuisine and not just food off a truck pre-made like most restaurants, be sure to try them out. If any Mexican restaurant is full of Caucasians and not many or any Mexicans except the workers, most likely it's off the truck. But here, take a look around and know this place is for real, very friendly people and workers too. We loved this place, and all the food we tried, I wish they would put one in Greenville/Winterville NC area. Wait staff comes right out with lots of chips, salsa, all kinds of sauces, and lime wedges, you do not even have to ask. I love the Pico de Gallo they make, so good, but watch the heat. If you cannot take the heat in your food, ask them to leave out the heat for you. There were more of these restaurants in Charlotte, but this one was the best, in our opinion. Try them out, you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved from LA, and we had to get our mexican food fix. We loved it! The burritos are so good. Fresh tortilla chips and salsa. The horchata is really good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best mexican in the area, for sure.   The customer service is phenomenal, and they somehow remember almost every diner.  The downside? It gets PACKED. However, I would rather have a packed place with good food than an empty place with slop.  Go, La Unica! You're an Indian Trail staple now."}
{"text":"Cheap, and awesome! You get so many different kinds of salsa for your starter chips and FREE QUESO!!! This girl is happy!"}
{"text":"great mexican place. The chips and 5 salsas and queso dip is worth it alone. Food came out peculiarly fast, and this was at lunch. Food was good though I did lose my server for some time, not sure where she went. Overall worth it and really cheap."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Sent my cold tacos back and it came back to me room temp. All the salsa choices was fun. Until my family realized they were all hot and no one could enjoy them. The cheese dip was tasteless. The rice had a weird taste. The meat was tuff. I've never had such a bad experience at a restaurant and I was expecting such a fantastic experience because of all the positive ratings!  My family and I will never be back!! SO disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best in the Charlotte area!  Everything I have had at La Unica is fabulous. The tacos are amazing!  Order Asada tacos, throw a little lime on there and enjoy. They pack a lot of meat in them too!  The staff are super friendly. We have tried a lot of other Mexican restaurants, but this is by far the best."}
{"text":"I got take out here once.  I don't remember what I ordered, but it wasn't anything great.  Being that Mexico is a large country I asked the waiter what the regional differences were & was met with the answer that there aren't any.  Not too impressive from the start."}
{"text":"So far away but well worth it. Astute service, wonderful authentic food, and a simple no frills experience. It far exceeds the tex-mex that Charlotte knows. Every trip is a decadent experience.  Feels like god is rubbing your tummy."}
{"text":"Great food. Variety of salsas to choose from and make your own custom salsa. Hot and quick food. Margaritas were big. They never have drink specials. Guacamole  was decent. Outside doesn't look like much but a great find!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Our most favorite Mexican restaurant is this one. Our favorite drink is the cinnamon rice drink and the fried ice cream is marvelous. These two items are a must if you ever go. The place also has a 100 sanitation score which is the best you can get. The service is also good. Win win."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food. If you love authentic tacos, I recommend you try this place. Thursdays they feature  $1 tacos and they're awesome. Good service and great good food. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I am from CA so I am very picky with my Mexican food and this place fits the bill. Their chips are salsa are fresh and delicious. Their green sauce on their enchiladas is perfect and clearly homemade. My husband has tried several different things and liked them all. Their servers are nice, the food comes out quickly, and its reasonably priced! It's always busy but they are efficient with getting people seated and fed quickly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food at great prices.  The tacos with pork, beef or fish are awesome and cheap!"}
{"text":"Favorite authentic Mexican restaurant. I come here every week and enjoy it every time . The service is amazing and the waitresses are all bilingual, this creates a warming feeling and a step closer to the Mexican culture. The food is full with flavors, La taqueria La Unica is my go to for Mexican cuisine and I strongly recommend it for everyone ."}
{"text":"Food was great! The carne con nopales was exactly like my mother in law makes and the barbacoa tacos were delicious. The kids menu is lacking though, my daughter loved the frijoles y arroz however I've tried better ground beef tacos."}
{"text":"This place is simply good food at a great price.  I love their authentic chicken tacos and the salsa is wonderful, but some of their other dishes are just OK.  The atmostphere is nothing special and they don't serve alcohol, so don't expect a whole lot more than a good meal and some awesome chips and salsa."}
{"text":"So me and my family decided to go and check this place out. Somebody needs to call Gordon Ramsey!!! The food took about 10 minutes to come out which is always a bad sign of precook food, which it was. Me being mexican know a thing or two about good tasting mexican food and let me tell you this food is horrendous! !  I dont know how this place is still in business? ! Anyways if I wanted microwaveable mexican  food, I would had stop by my local grocery store.  Honestly it would had tasted a whole lot better."}
{"text":"The food is great, inexpensive, staff is friendly, and overall one of the best Mexican restaurants in Monroe."}
{"text":"I have been to the La Unica Restaurant in Harrisburg, Indian Trail, and Huntersville and those were all fantastic with great service. However, when I came to this one it did not compare to the other three. The waiter was rude and the food was not as good as the other three restaurants. I will not be visiting again, and I recommend that you don't either.  If you are thinking of going to this La Unica on Central Ave I would say to you to consider going to a different location even though it may be a little further. Go to the one in Indian Trail, Huntersville or Harrisburg. They will offer you better food and service. Guaranteed."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Charlotte in my opinion. If Mexican food is on our minds then this is where were going. We get take out from there typically and its always hot, fresh, and delicious!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I are from Southern California and we know Mexican food. This place hits the mark every in all aspects.  The 4 salsa choice are all awesome. They are spicy but worth the runny nose! Al Pastor and Barbacoa are the real deal"}
{"text":"We've eaten here before, the former times during the dinner rush. Those dining experiences were 100x better than the awful service tonight. We arrived around 8pm tonight, we waited at our table for 15 min before our server opted to take our order. My biggest pet peeve (which is why I hate being seated in a back table tucked away from server stations) is being unattended for more than 10 min ESPECIALLY when it's slow!   So we finally get to place our order and boom server doesn't know the menu yet. Because apparently what I ordered was a new one for her. Above all, they came back confirming my order thrice, thereafter, one time another server confirming. To top it off, my order came out wrong anyways and our drinks never once refilled. At that point, I've succumbed to their poor service and decided I could skip a meal. At check out, we're asked, \"how was everything?\" Glad someone else was with me to kindly pass a, \"it was great.\""}
{"text":"Almost couldn't find it, but glad I did!  Tons of free extras, and unbelievably cheap, great food. I thought there was a mistake when I was paying because it was so inexpensive.  Of the bouquet of salsas they bring to you, most are quite spicy -- I wish they had a couple milder ones like a garlic-based maybe..."}
{"text":"Amazing and authentic. Super clean. Efficient and friendly service. One of the best Mexican food places I've eaten at. Highly recommend it. Best of all, inexpensive! A great value!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a find... Me and my wife were looking for good Mexican food to try in the Charlotte area. So far, this place is close to what we got in California.  In CA, there are burrito places all over. I am jaded about my Mexican food being up to par. The quality of service and food were top for what you pay. Our waitress, Rafaela, was very cool and hooked us up! We will definitely be back soon!!!! Thank you."}
{"text":"BEWARE !!!!!!!!!!! The  food was great until I checked my account and  3  charges from a 3 different law firms in 3 different states, appeared on my account. Not worth the headache."}
{"text":"Always excellent.  Hard Chicken Tacos La Unica style minus the sour cream is my staple.  I order this because I do not need the beans & rice.  Along with the complimentary salsa verde's (watch the heat) and the pico & cheese dip ~Man'O'man Mama Mia & all that. I could eat here a few times a week (& sometimes I do). Very affordable, especially if you don't buy a drink, but I always treat myself to a Coke which comes served in a very cold can and a big glass of ice.  I highly recommend this meal.  My mouth is watering typing this review. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love Love Love this restaurant! Great food. Try the authentic chicken tacos. The BEST in the city. Period."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. We are transplants from the San Francisco Bay Area, California, and we were looking for a good Mexican restaurant here in the Charlotte area.  The service is wonderful. We were there last Sunday and we were served quickly and the wait staff is really friendly. I had the Carnitas dinner and it was delicious. The carnitas were savory and not fatty. We are so happy that we found this place. Great value too."}
{"text":"¡Yum yum yum, Delicioso! Agree with the other reviews completely. This place surprised and impressed me like few do. Fabulous service, fresh food, authentic Mexican. The shelf margarita is the best we've had-- seriously!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food. They make their lemonade the hispanic way with limes. Soooo good. Crowded during peak hours of lunch and dinner. No alcohol, but the food is the best. Looking for good Mexican food this is your spot. Nothing on the menu will go wrong. It is a place to try good quality mexican food."}
{"text":"Good mexican here. They even have mexican breakfast options on the menu which most do not.  It holds the Indian Trail market on LockDown, destroying any competitor that attemps a sad effort.  Its good but outside of Indian Trail awaits something better!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've ever had...period.  Salsas and queso make it an over the top experience.  A must have if you live in or around Charlotte."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Very polite and fast service. Only drawback is they do not serve alcohol, would have loved a margarita. Very generic decor, not decorated in a Mexican or Spanish theme. Although the salsa and queso is amazing!"}
{"text":"Was looking on Yelp to find a Mexican restaurant that was good nearby and found this place.. Two tables who arrived after us got their chips & drinks brought out and orders taken before we were even addressed. The menu doesn't have Tostadas so I ordered them 'off menu' with rice and beans (I wanted Tacos, but they don't serve crunchy). The waitress didn't bring the rice and beans and when I told her I didn't get them, she stated \"No.\" My wife had to remind her that I had ordered them and she said nothing, looking lost, so I ordered them a second time. My wife's Enchiladas did not come with sauce so they were dry and the cheese wasn't melted due to them being cold. They only had a green sauce to substitute so she ended up giving them to me and I used salsa on them.  When my wife asked for lemons the waitress said \"No, we have lime\", and picked the bowl of limes up and a little angrily slammed them down on the table in front of her !!! and immediately walked off without saying anything!  Does she think that my wife is blind and can't see that there are limes at the table? Also, my wife did not ask for limes, she asked for lemon! I felt that this was very inappropriate behavior, and for her to do this suggested that she was letting us know that limes were an acceptable substitute.. If we felt otherwise, don't we have that right? Throughout our meal the waitress seemed to have an attitude and was very concerned with going to the corner to check her cell phone and text during our visit. Everyone around us seemed to be getting Excellent service,  with one table having two VERY attentive employees.   So, it's time to go and the bill comes.. There were no prices on the check and the girl at the register needed help ringing up our order (two girls rang in the check). I ended up being charged $12.50 for my meal, because apparently they didn't get the memo that when you order an entrée you don't charge for each individual item. I asked before hand if the meal was available to order as an entrée, but this obviously wasn't communicated to the cashier or written down (both girls seemed confused by the check and had to ask me what I had ordered..!?) I see that everyone else is a fan, maybe we came on the wrong night (Wed.) or maybe we are just far too picky..? The only positive is the food comes out really fast! We won't be back!"}
{"text":"Don't bother going there unless you want awful service and hair in your food.  The service is incredibly slow and the waitresses are rude."}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast and dinner. The lunch specials I've tried so far are only ok. Do not order guacamole on its own for chips. It's a smashed up avocado on a plate with salt. Not yum, but if you get a meal that comes with guacamole, it's good. Good carnitas. Not crazy about the carne asada.   Crazy about the salsa. This is another Mexican restaurant where I'd dive mouth first into a vat of it... Anyway, go here for breakfast or brunch if you haven't already!!!"}
{"text":"I thought the food and service were both excellent. The free queso dip, salsa verde, mild and hot salsas were icing on the cake.  There was a nice selection of vegetarian options, and the ambiance was laid back, pleasant, and a place that invited you to stay longer."}
{"text":"So excited to eat here again! Came 2,200 miles for vacation and I found time to stop in. My favorite are the Lengua (beef tongue) Tacos. Yum! So tender - they do them right!!! Staff are always friendly and helpful with special requests. Terrific."}
{"text":"The food is delicious but the waitresses are not friendly most of the time. The talk about people in Spanish while they wait for the food to come out. It's very sad how they treat customers here. I have gone here many times, over and over many of us have been treated with attitudes. It seems like everytime we go here there is always a problem. So we all have agreed to stopped eating there. That's is sad that workers at this restaurant have ran off over 10 paying customers who knows how many more. The place is too small. It's always crowded especially during lunchtime Monday thru Friday void the wait if possible. We all dislike that we couldn't pay at the table and couldn't avoid that long line to pay on the way out. Smh"}
{"text":"My family loves this place.  We have been eating here for over ten years!  Great food and even better people.  We love the Crazy Burrito and Soft Tacos a la unica style."}
{"text":"This is certainly the top authentic Mexican resturaunt in my area. The enchiladas were stuffed full of deliciousness, great beans and an even better cheese dip! The staff here always gets the food out quick and it is always tasty. The owner has done a great job at holding this restaurant to the highest standard through the years, no wonder they had to expand for more dining space!"}
{"text":"Did $1 taco Thursday on a whim today with 2 college-age kids, had a great time. Good tacos, great salsas, friendly service.  Putting it on my weekly lunch route!"}
{"text":"I have spent time opening facilities in Mexico (DF, Queretaro and Tizayuca) and although I wouldn't rate La Unica on that scale I would say that this is some of the best Mexican food my wife and I have been able to find in the Indian Trail area, it's always fresh, and the service is great.  We order a lot of take out and its always correct which we appreciate so as to not have to come back.  We really enjoy La Unica and glad you are in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"There are Mexican Restaurants and then there's La Unica. Hands down best Mexican Restaurant in NC and VA ( and we have tried MANY Mexican restaurants between here and VA).  They cater to food allergies better than most. It is almost always packed but wait times are short. Can't say enough good things about La Unica!"}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week and the food is fantastic.  I've been to most of the Mexican restaurants in town and this is by far, the best.  When you first sit down,they get your drink order and bring several types of salsa, fresh  pico de gallo and delicious melted quesa dip with chips. You get a little bowl to put your salsas in, but I only use the pica de gallo and dip (mixed) and it's heaven.  I almost always get the chicken enchilada la unica and usually the mini one.  The prices are great too.  At lunch time it is very crowded, but we've never had to wait.  It's in a strip type office bldg. and once was extremely small. My office was right beside it and when we moved out, they expanded.  It's sort of strange to eat in a booth that was once my office!!!!  For those coming from the Charlotte area, it's the street to the left, right after Hardee's and for those coming from the east side of 74, take a rt. after you go over the bridge.  It's worth stopping for!!!,"}
{"text":"We stopped by the restaurant for lunch around noon on a Thursday to find this place stuffed to the rafters. I can't say I have ever seen a lunch place  as packed as this, except maybe Roosters on a Friday. There were a lot of Hispanic folks which really spoke to the authenticity of the place. We were given a booth in the back (it is surprisingly large in there - like the Tardis) and two large menus by a man who seemed almost comical in his \"very tired of the day and of his job\" air. I almost felt bad for the poor guy. The menu did a good job of presenting itself as authentic while still allowing for explanations of what each dish was comprised of for gringos like us.  Mine was essentially a deep fried burrito, filled with #4 spiciness ground hamburger, with a pile of lettuce shavings, some tomato, one plop of sour cream, a wee bit of beans and a queso poured over the top which, unfortunately, ruined the fried crispness. My husband had the enchilada. This was one of those circumstances where we had all the same ingredients, just folded differently, that happens in American Mexican restaurants now and then. Also, the salsas they brought out (without explanation): 2 cute milk bottles. One had nothing but pure red and the other was a chunky, garden-style salsa. We needed to experiment to see what was hot (the red) but they wisely brought out three little bowls so we had one for each salsa and one for a mix of the two. These were either a 2 on the a hot Scale or an 8 so mixing is wise. The bill was something like $17. Overall, this was really good. I think it is a matter of finding your favorite dish and they'll probably do that one spectacularly. Once they ditch that queso....stuff."}
{"text":"Let me first say that the food at this place is 5 stars!! It is so good and tastes very authentic. I give it 4 stars b/c I fully believe that every good Mexican restaurant should have a bar. Mexican without margaritas is unheard of. This place has no bar and not the greatest atmosphere. Just a bunch of tables in a room. Greater ambience and a bar would make this place 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Good food. I hate writing this stuff. It's good. You can tell by the stars. It's a 4. There we go. It's good. Fuck me."}
{"text":"I've frequented many Mexican restaurants in Charlotte. I'd have to say that this place is one of the best. The atmosphere is always hustling and bustling. They're almost always busy. If you go at night, be prepared to wait in line. They will not seat you if your entire party has not all arrived!! I felt bad today because my friend and I got in before these two couples who were waiting on one more person to complete their group. But oh well, there's a sign up that details this rule, with \"No Exceptions!\"   We were seated quickly. Our hostess had eyeliner that she drew to the corner of her eye and beyond. I thought it looked cool, like a character out of star trek or something. Within no time, they served up the free chips and salsa. The salsa was home made, and very good. The super hot salsa is extremely hot, and will make you sweat. I ended up ordering Camarones Diabla (I took a picture of it and placed it in the gallery here). I almost always order this dish when I go to the more authentic Mexican restaurants. The dish was very good, the sauce was perfect. Although I could've used a little more spice. They also put a lot of shrimp in it. One thing I will complain about though, is that I think they would've done better by deveining the shrimp. Also there were still a couple shrimp peels that hadn't been completely peeled off, so I did it myself. Regardless of those minor details, the dish was still superb.   I've had their pulled pork soft tacos on previous visits. Those are also very good. Especially when you put that super hot salsa on it. Their tacos are definitely way better than Taco Bell. The service was great, my water was constantly being refilled, and the waitress kept calling me amigo, making me feel like she doesn't hate me and that I'm part of her extended family. I welcome that kind of affection. This is a great Mexican restaurant. I would definitely return, recommend, and bring amigos."}
{"text":"WOOOW!  My favorite Mexican restaurant in the entire area. If you're looking for a fancy upscale environment, this is not your place. if you are looking for earthy down home flavor packed Mexican food, come on in!  Everything I've tried here is as good as it gets, rivaling anything I've had in Texas or Cali. The variety of 5 or 6 salsas brought to the table upon arrival (along with free cheese dip!) are wonderful. I'm thinking anyone should be able to find something they like here. I stick with the vegetarian offerings, and not all Mexican restaurants I go to are as accommodating as La Unica. I wish there were more restaurants like this. I've been to a few other \"La Unica\" restaurants in the vicinity but I assume they are not related? None of the others hold a candle to this location in Monroe. And before I forget, I should mention the prices are incredibly affordable. You can eat like a king here for $10-$15.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"My \"go-to\" Mexican restaurant. We have been eating here for years and love it. The food is excellent and the staff (Victor) is great! Not so thrilled with the new chips, please bring back the old ones. Still best Mexican around!  Oh and the cheese dip and salsa are amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mexican food. My family is from outside of Phoenix so I have had the real deal, and this is it."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a number of times and it would be very hard for us to find one bad thing to say about this place. Service has always been superb and the food is absolutely delectable. From start to finish we loved every second here."}
{"text":"We have gotten take out from here a few times and more times than not the order is wrong.  Tonight I called it in and when my husband got there he asked the woman at the register to make sure our order was correct.  She said she had already checked it and it \"definitely\" was.  When we opened the order at home it wasn't correct - I think we were given someone else's order.  This time we put it back in the bag and went back.  The same woman took everything out of the bag said \"well you ordered a taco so here is a taco\" and started to put it back in the bag.  My husband said he didn't want a cold taco, that he wanted his dinner warm, so to please start over with everything.  The lady said she understood and my husband took a seat.  When he got home that same, partially wrapped taco was in the bag.  We will definitely not return to Taqueria La Unica."}
{"text":"The food is topnotch, the salsas are fresh and great, they put down half a dozen and a great queso dip. The food is authentic mexican from steak to ceviche and plenty in between. The food is always fresh and ita always packed by noon during the week, and you have to wait on Friday and Saturday nights.  Well worth a trip."}
{"text":"Always on the lookout for excellent Mexican food in Charlotte, I closely followed a thread on another popular bulletin board. After the fourth or fifth person chimed in with \"Taqueria La Unica in Monroe\", I decided it was high time to map out and visit this place.  We live in Ballantyne, so Taqueria La Unica in Monroe is a 45 minute drive from our house at a minimum, but we decided to make the trek this past Saturday evening around 7PM.   We arrived at the restaurant around 7:45PM and found one of the last tables. By the time we left, the lot was overflowing and there were people waiting to be seated. This is a small restaurant located in a business park strip area that's very easily missed. It's in a very quiet, dark, run down area of town, so if you feel like you might be venturing to the wrong side of the tracks, you're probably pretty close.  Upon sitting down you are given a basket of large chips along with your own personal salsa bowl and a stunning array of salsas in small carafes; you also get a chipotle sauce in a squeeze bottle, a small bowl of queso, a picante pico de gallo and a small bowl of limes. There's only one issue with this amazing lineup: All but one carafe contains astoundingly hot salsa!  The queso is almost a necessity to cool your tastebuds after four of the five salsas. The pico de gallo offers no respite either. I appreciate that this restaurant is incredibly authentic, but I simply can't enjoy all the salsas they present (hence the one star dock). Be cautious about what you pour into your salsa bowl. Taste first and pour after that. I like to consider myself a lover of hot foods, but the queso was a welcome coating of cool from the incredible heat.  So, that's what you get presented at your table for free, just for showing up. So frankly, if it's hot, who cares? The orders are where it's at.  The menu seems a little bit limited. No \"Arroz con Pollo\" which is my husband's favorite option, but he made do with a burrito that didn't warrant any complaints.  I ordered three tacos: Carnitas tacos, tacos Al Pastor and the shredded beef tacos. I have no idea which pork taco was which, but one of them made me melt in delight. I'm going to have to find out next time.  I also ordered a side of beans (refried). My husband ordered a side of guacamole. Both sides are far more than enough for two, so gang up on your ordering there.   The prices are amazing. The ambiance isn't great, but it's authentic Mexican in Charlotte. They don't HAVE to be great. We have had some incredibly good Mexican food in Charlotte, but a day after visiting this restaurant we were saying, \"We *have* to find some time to visit it again.\"  This restaurant doesn't have the largest menu in the region. Nor does it have the craziest drinks in the region. It is, however, the most authentic Mexican we've found in this region and we will absolutely be back the next time we're up for the forty minute trek!"}
{"text":"When there are lines to get into an eatery tucked away at a dingy strip mall on Old Monroe Road in Indian Land, two things come to mind. One, either this is one hell of a good restaurant, or, two, it's the only decent place to eat within a ten-mile radius, and people are hungry, and better eat there than go hungry. Thankfully, La Unica is indeed one hell of a great Mexican restaurant.  As far as \"authentic\" Mexican eateries are concerned, La Unica passes some strict requirements. Being that most Mexican restaurants tend to lean towards Tex-Mex (and there's nothing wrong with that), La Unica is one of the few that serves more typical Mexican fare, more from southern Mexico. In other words, lots of seafood in addition to standards like enchiladas and tamales.   Everyone's mentioned the carnitas, and I too will sing its praises: best carnitas in Charlotte. So tender and succulent! I had the carnita burrito, and it was so damned good that I was tempted to have another, but, crikey, that would have been excessive.   One big thing to keep in mind: La Unica does NOT have a liquor license, so you won't be able to chase down your carnitas tacos with a cold Tecate. And, no, they won't allow you to bring your own cerveza either. Bummer. YO QUIERO TECATE CON MI TACOS AL PASTOR, PINCHE!"}
{"text":"I am a fan. Coming from California, most of the mexican food in NC has been disappointing at best. La Unica, however, is authentic and good. Free endless chips and salsa with a variety of fresh made salsa's and cheeze dips is a great start. Every dish I have had there has been excellent from the Barbacoa burrito's to the Chilequilles to the enchiladas. They don't serve liquor though so get a beer; no margaritas. It helps also that I speak some spanish."}
{"text":"Simply put this place is awesome!  If it is a Friday or Saturday you better get there early as there is always a line, but it does go by fast.  When anyone ask for a great mexican restaurant I always recommend La Unica."}
{"text":"Most authentic Mexican you can have in this area. It is my favorite Mexican Restaurant. The staff is very friendly and the food is amazing. I have been here many times and will still keep coming here for whenever I feel like having Mexican. This is truely a gem in this area. Make sure to try their delicious queso!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing Mexico food. One of my new favorite places to eat while in Matthews. Only down fall is there is no alcohol. That was disappointing that I could not order a margaritas with my meal. But the food is delicious and authentic Mexican food which I enjoy."}
{"text":"Inconsumable garbage food.  If you are wondering if there is a hidden gem in the otherwise uneven Charlotte Mexican food world down in Indian Trail based on Yelp reviews, well, I have your answer: there absolutely is not.  Take a better look at the reviews than I did, and notice that everyone mentions their love of the price. Maybe they use great ingredients, but I couldn't tell in either their disturbingly underseasoned carne asada tacos or their inedible vegetable fajitas.  The carne asada came in a big, uncut chunk of meat tucked in a piece of aluminum foil. If it wasn't for the aluminum foil, I would have assumed it was overcooked in the microwave with zero seasoning. They must have been saving it for the three vegetables in the vegetable fajitas. Did the cooks take prior terrorist interrogation experience to this job and waterboard these vegetables with seasoning? I guess those guys probably need jobs, too, but they should dial it back.  Salsa was not good. Luckily that prevented me from buying (yes, there is a charge) for more chips and salsa. I should have followed my first impulse and left the laundromat-looking restaurant when I first pulled into the parking lot. I should have followed my second impulse and left after the other patrons looked most comfortable at a Golden Coral or some sort of bike fest in Myrtle Beach. No joke, multiple loud motorcycles went through the cramped parking lot in the 35 minutes between when I arrived and when I left for a different Mexican restaurant.  Oh, and this place does not have a liquor license. I have just about nothing positive to say about this restaurant, other than it wasn't the worst Mexican restaurant I've ever eaten at (it was the 2nd).   You can do better."}
{"text":"Best mexican food around period. You know a place is good when it's always busy. As many times as we've gone it is always consistant, fast, and the staff couldn't be better!!"}
{"text":"LOVEEEEE THIS PLACE!! Portion is great and taste is amazing. I always order the steak fajita and its enough for 2 people. I am obsessed with thier green sauce!! Very spicy guacamole. Cant live without it! They also have mexican soups on sundays which are fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent along with the service! La Unica burrito is a must have if you like burritos!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! The food is consistently great as is the service. We've never had a bad dining experience. Very reasonable prices. Go!"}
{"text":"I had a very bad experience at this restaurant where I found a fairly large chicken bone in my burrito.  I could have choked on this!!  Their response was very nonchalant.  They told me it happens, can't always get all the bones out and did not even offer me any discount.  Are you kidding me with that response?!!!  I had to almost beg for a discount and explained to them that had I choked, it would have resulted in a law suit.  Needless to say, I will not go back.  Shame on you La Unica!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken soup with quesadillas lunch special. Good price point and good service. The soup had way too many tortilla chips and way too few pieces of chicken. Even if you call it tortilla soup it should be a sprinkle on the top not a main ingredient to buffer having better ingredients. Taste wise it was ok and lacking in flavor. The quesadillas were delicious as was the hot green sauce. The red sauce is just ok. Chips were hot and fresh and I like the carafes provided for the salsa. I would like to return and have a combo meal. I've tried the tacos in the summer when they post up inside Legion brewery and they are very good, especially after the 4 mile run. There aren't many Mexican restaurant choices here in Charlotte. Being from California I wouldn't come back to this place especially with the  stiff Bay Area competition but being in Charlotte I would come again due to the great location and lack of competition. The clientele is mostly Latin folks so that is a good sign."}
{"text":"Proof that quality of cuisine trumps atmosphere.  Great Mexican food that you would not expect to get off of Old Monroe Rd."}
{"text":"This is a great family restaurant that serves authentic Mexican food. The staff are very attentive, and food is reasonably priced. If your looking to find a great Authentic Mexican Dish, this is a great place. The staff speak English, and you can order to go and come pick up at the door. We have never waited for a place to sit, or parking. They sell fresh homemade juices Mango, Tamarindo, Jamaica, Horchata, and Melon. Big Cups that you'll never need to refill."}
{"text":"UNLESS YOUR HISPANIC DONT BOTHER!! . I will start by saying I have been to this restaurant consistently for two years on Thursdays . The food is OK but fast. I am an American who doesn't speak Spanish and the reverse racism here is real I went in today to be set down as normal and watch three groups of hispanics come in behind me and be seat and waited on all before anybody even came to see what I wanted to drink. Why ? I come there every single week ! I leave a 40%tip to people who refuse to even speak the language of the country ! Now I will do everything I can do to make sure to drive business away from this place!"}
{"text":"Mexican food is authentic! The food is amazing and they give you large portions. Our server Lucy was attentive and made sure our drinks were always full. Plus, chips, salsas, and QUESO are all complimentary! The price is RIGHT!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Authentic food, good service and super fast.  Had the chips salsa and queso delivered to our table, ordered and our meal was there within 5 minutes.  Tacos are the bomb!"}
{"text":"The food here is so good!! My three kids and husband were very pleased with the amount of food and quality. If you are looking for a place that serves different kinds of salsa, guac, and cheese with chips before your meal then this is the place. They bring each table a substantial amount for free (extra rounds cost which is expected). You get so much however that I cannot imagine needing more. The restaurant is clean and easy to find. The waitress was not very friendly even after giving her several positive compliments about the food. She seemed annoyed that we took so long to order (we couldn't decide and had three kids to order for). I would have given five stars if the staff was more friendly. I would still go back if in the area."}
{"text":"Friendly and courteous staff. We were given chips and salsa the moment we arrived. I had the lunch chimichanga which is the best I've ever tasted. The portions were decent. We will definitely be back for another visit soon."}
{"text":"This has been a go-to for my family for over 10 years. Big portions, delicious food, and the friendliest staff you'll ever meet. Economically priced and with such a varied menu, it's hard to find a better restaurant for the whole family!"}
{"text":"They have dollar taco nights on Tuesdays and we love it!!! You can't beat $1 tacos! I usually order 4-5 tacos for myself and husband usually gets 8-9 for himself. Yes we are fatties =)   The tacos are pretty good and the margaritas are pretty good too ( although they are not really strong)   The servers are friendly and nice and the place is pretty clean!"}
{"text":"Very very good. I don't usually eat Mexican food but am venturing out. Good sized portions for good prices! Queso cheese is free with the chips they give you!! Big plus in my book since I don't eat salsa but love queso."}
{"text":"friendly staff, very fast service, good food.   two notes:  1. if you like to have your favorite cerveza with your lunch or dinner, you'll have to find another place.  No beer served.  Would be great if they did. 2. as someone else mentioned, the hot salsa is VERY HOT!.  If you like a little kick but don't want to burn your mouth, try mixing the 2 salsas. Overall a very pleasant dining experience.  Will invite friends to join us there."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in the Charlotte area. The special spicy and creamy green sauce is amazing!! It is like a combination of avocado, sour cream and Verde sauce! So good!"}
{"text":"This place is great and always packed to the gills during busy times. I've placed To Go orders while filled to the rafters and still receive my order in about 15 minutes. Always enjoy everything I try on the menu and the horchata is amazing, try it!"}
{"text":"This is authentic Mexican and it's as good as it gets. My favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte (Indian Trail). Try all the different sauces with the complimentary chips so good and spicy. Their 'street tacos' are amazing. Three tacos are really more than enough. Very filling. The restaurant was recently renovated so can accommodate the regular crowds even better. Expect a wait if your going during peak lunch/dinner hours. Super nice staff that is generally attentive. If you haven't been and love Mexican food, this is a must try location."}
{"text":"Better than I expected when we stopped in Monroe on the way back from the beach.   Definitely far from health food. Black beans were not an option.   Fresh tasty tortillas. My husband ordered roasted chicken. Tons of salsa and cheese dip without even ordering."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal at this awesome mexican restaurant. If you're looking for a margarita, unfortunately you won't find it here - or any adult beverages for that matter. However, they more than make up for it in their fresh and fantastic food. Their authentic \"street\" tacos are my fave, and for the first time, I ordered a \"side salad\". This salad was huge and had a layer of cheese on top. It was extremely good, with the exception of having only 2 choices of salad dressings: ranch (which wasn't very good) or 1000 Island (which I've never liked). Next time, I'll forgo the dressing and just use a little salsa. My husband especially loved their huge bowl of chicken soup.  Tip: if you want unsweetened tea, you'll be better off to get half and half. Their sweet tea isn't too sweet, but their unsweetened tea is lacking somewhat.  Service is quick."}
{"text":"Worst tacos ever service are terrible and the line to checkout takes like 30 minutes!"}
{"text":"I'm in loveeeee! I am SO pleased with this spot. I read the reviews and decided to check it out for myself. I love Mexican food, and so does my mom. I am new to the area so on my second night in town with my mom visiting we went here. SO happy we did. I can not express how good the chips and salsa were, it came with queso and so many salsa options. I had a chimichanga that was kinda bland but some extra salsa and salt helped a bunch. I think next time I'll just ask for it spicy. But it was crazy cheap too. I am so excited to go back!"}
{"text":"Always great taco's! I'm in love with their grilled fish, Asada and Carnita taco's. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. It's the closest I've found since moving here from South California in the 90's to what I know as authentic Mexican. The staff is always friendly and goes out of their way to satisfy. Stay away from those other knock off 'La Unica's', this is the real deal!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch this past weekend.  It had been a while.  Nothing has changed.  It's just good food, at a good price, executed well, and served attentively.  What else do you want when dining out in Indian Trail?!"}
{"text":"A good place for authentic Mexican food at reasonable prices and generous portions.  It isn't fancy inside and wasn't busy when we arrived, but as time went on, more patrons showed up for dinner, too. There were three kinds of salsa for the chips.  I stayed with mildest, but the more adventurous would like the hottest one.  This was my first time here and I chose the chicken enchiladas.  It was composed of 3 enchiladas, rice, refried beans.   It was good and I could only finish 1 1/2 of the enchiladas.  The rest went home with me.  The others in our party gave positive reviews for their dishes."}
{"text":"LOVE the food and service. And the price is very reasonable. Being born and raised in Los Angeles, I've been blessed to have eaten at some really good mexican restaurants. In the greater Charlotte area they're tough to find. La Unica is certainly one of them!"}
{"text":"Really good food ! Fresh and tasty . We order to go once a month and a real treat for our little family. Our fam favorites are the tacos la unica and my son loves the kids meals . I am a reviewer who feels that good food and service deserve to be acknowledged. I also believe that food and taste is a personal preference so I frown upon reviewers who blast restaurants for their own biases and bad moods or negativity. If I don't find a restaurants cuisine good it's usually do to my individual tastes and don't write negative or biased reviews !"}
{"text":"Good Mexican restaurant in Monroe. Quality is always consistent. They refill the chips and cheese dip regularly and the food is turned out quickly. Have never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"The best Mexican that I have ever had in any town, in any state.  The salsa and queso are fantastic.  I try to have a different dish every time I go, which is at least twice a month, and have yet to have a bad meal.  The selections are great and the staff is very helpful and friendly.  The only problem that I have ever had at La Unica  was getting a table at dinner time on the weekend.  Seems like everyone wants great Mexican food and that's what they get at Taqueria La Unica.    By the way, there is another restaurant in Indian Trail by the same name, but DO NOT BE FOOLED.  It is nowhere close to the quality of food that you get at La Unica in Monroe on Walkup Ave."}
{"text":"Multiple Wonderful salsa as soon as you sit down! Very authentic and the selection is better than the rest. A definite if in Monroe."}
{"text":"Consistent quality at great prices and fast service. This place is managed well. My favorite is the Carne con Nopales. Though I wish they could get a little better crust on the carne sometimes.  Very important to us is the sanitation rating. It is consistently above 95 which is our minimum. Many competitor places do not achieve this regularly so we come here instead.  I really like that they serve limes with the salsa."}
{"text":"Love this place. I'm originally from the SW and know good Mexican. The four salsas they bring out with the chips are amazing. Mild to super hot. The green is my favorite! The carne asada tacos in soft corn tortillas remind me of tacos on the Yucatan peninsula. Simply delicious topped with cilantro and onion. We go there about once a week. If we don't, we start jonesen for their salsa."}
{"text":"I love La Unica it is the most amazing Mexican food. There cheese quesadilla is the bomb and the service is fast. Very welcoming and it defiantly leaves you feeling full you might have left overs."}
{"text":"Been coming here a million years now it seems. The food has always been spectacular and cheap. Free queso, chips plus 4 kinds of salsa & pico de gallo. The salsas are house made, and you know this because some days it's not so hot, some days it will burn your butthole off. This is ok. Try their barbacoa, ceviche (order as tostadas de ceviche instead of platillo, it's a better deal). Try the agua de Jamaica (sweetened hibiscus tea). If you aren't adventurous, the pollo fundido is never going to do you wrong. Look for daily special carne fundida too. Taco salad is great. Tortas never fail to please. If you order nachos, get them with chorizo, trust me. And if fajitas are your thing, this place will forever be who you judge all other fajitas by- fajitas la unica packed w steak, chicken, big shrimp, and chorizo are the best that exist. The servers all know us & ask about my dad every time we come in. Always great service. Tip: avoid Sundays, this place gets hour plus wait for tables after church. Go during the week when it's slow. You won't just judge fajitas by this place, all future Mexican restaurants you ever eat at will pale in comparison and bow to the culinary greatness that is La Unica!!!"}
{"text":"Quick! Quick! Quick!  I came in by myself and I sat down and ordered four tacos, water and lime, and a side of cheese and within four minutes it was back to me within 15 minutes I was paying, out the door. I wasn't complaining because I was in such a rush but it would've been better if I could've had at least a dos eqius just sip on second slow myself down.   The Tacos de Carnitas were pretty good but super greasy but hit the spot.  I probably won't return because it so far from home and there's no alcohol. I truly enjoy by tacos more when a beer is in hand. However, this place seems great for large parties and very family friendly!"}
{"text":"Ahhh I love this place. We have been here about 10 times and I had to write them a review now that I'm a yelp user. They are always nice when you come in and their place is bigger than before. Their kitchen always comes out to be the same, I usually order the chicken soup which comes with a quesadilla. The chicken soup consists of chicken broth and a lot of veggies, such as carrots, peppers, very healthy meal and a huge portion too!"}
{"text":"Just took the family to dinner and the reviews for this gem are spot on. The food was fabulous, fun atmosphere and super attentive and efficient wait staff. We shared the carnitas dinner ( by far the best carnitas I have had since leaving the southwest), enchiladas, burritos and veggie fajitas- all plates were delicious. Awesome place, will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This place falls into a wonderful category: The hole-in-the-wall excellence. On the edge of a shopping mall in Indian Trail, this place looks unobtrusive but friendly. The menu puts the next smile on your face with its cheap prices. When it came out, a lot of the food looked a lot like that at other decent Mexican places like this, but when I tasted it, it was so much better! Beware of hot sauces/dishes though, they really mean it there. The staff is very friendly.  This is a place for a simple, middle-of-the-week meal out that will make your wallet and your tastebuds happy."}
{"text":"La Unica rocks.   The authentic tacos are awesome, there a $1.75...try one if you have never had one.  We almost always get the burrito Tuawana...also their ice tea is perfection mixed 1/2 sweet and 1/2 unsweetened.  Staff is AWESOME, some of best people I have ever meet.  To ME there is no doubt this is the best Mexican food in the Charlotte area.  Also, this is in a small strip mall...they also have signs to that read no meetings, no seating before all parties arrive...in other words \"we're too busy to seat you if your not ready....and please don't hang around because we are really busy...\"  (my interpretation)  GREAT FOOD!!!"}
{"text":"There are many La Unicas in Charlotte area, but this one is the best. Great Mexican food."}
{"text":"Ay Dios mío! Food was banging. I've lived near this place for almost 9 years and never bothered to try it. God forgive me, I judged this place too quickly. The parking lot is horrible. I ordered 6 tacos de lengua y al pastor. Sis bought her favorite Torta de milanesa con papas fritas. Horchata wasn't that great but overall it was delicious. We're gonna get fat. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Real authentic food. Tacos are amazing. Very affordable. Absolutely the best Mexican food in Monroe."}
{"text":"Oh man, this place rules. The food is out of this world. After we were seated we were served a basket of fresh chips with three small carafes of fresh and spicy salsa. There was a fourth salsa in a squeeze bottle and a bowl of warm white queso. Our entrees were served quickly, and they were outstanding. I had the fajitas La Unica, which included chicken, steak, shrimp and chorizo with onions, peppers and mushrooms. My daughter had beef tacos that were actually chopped steak and they were delicious (I don't think they serve ground beef). The prices are really reasonable. Our soft drinks were served out of the can, which is fine with me. This isn't a fancy place. You can see the chefs through plexiglass panels, and the night we were there futbol was showing on the TVs. I will definitely return to La Unica."}
{"text":"Having lived in Charlotte over 10 years, I can't believe I hadn't heard of this place till 2012!  Authentic, hole in the wall type Mexican restaurant that gets very, very busy every day. Excellent and very friendly waiting staff. Seeing that we're Indians and that we probably like hot food, the owner brought out a green colored salsa (Guac based) in addition to the 2 red salsas given out with the chips. We LOVE the green salsa - really spicy and flavorful... haven't you sometimes felt like eating on even when your mouth is burning hot? Its like that!  Over the last few times that we've gone there, we've ordered a number of dishes - california burrito, la unica burrito, carne asada tacos, arros con pollo, camarones al chipotle, pechuga de pollo ala mexicana, chimmichanga dinner, etc... you get the picture. All were great; better than we've had anywhere in Charlotte or elsewhere. Not one case where we even felt like the dish or experience could've been better.  A recommendation - the place tends to get very packed and depending on what time and day you decide to go, you may have to wait to be seated. You can also phone in your order and pick it up once ready."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!  Best Pork Carnitias in town!   Beware it gets CRAZY busy for dinner especially on the weekends and there is no beer or alcohol served. So if you can't eat your Mexican without a Cervesa like my husband can't seem to do, then Take Out is more for you."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican place in town! My husband & I have been coming here for several years now & have never been disappointed. They recently remodeled too & it's even faster in & out."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food with authentic cuisine was definitely impressed by the atmosphere a top place to go when visiting Indian trail"}
{"text":"It is so hard to find authentic Mexican food. However, this place is amazing and provides just that. This is by far the best Mexican Restaurant in Monroe. I live in Charlotte but I promise I will drive 30 minutes just for a chipotle burrito."}
{"text":"Really good food.  SUPER FAST!!  Would have given 5  stars except for the inattentive waitress.  She never came back and checked on us."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst Mexican restaurant I've ever been to. Waitress sets the wrong food down then wants to argue with you about it. Very rude staff. Food was mediocre."}
{"text":"Seems to be a very good rendition of very traditional Mexican fare (if you are looking for some sort of modern mexi-texa-cali fusion place, this is not it). As we were seated we were started with two salsas, mild & hot along with very fresh chips.  Our waitress was very attentive despite working numerous tables.  Our Fajitas were served \"fresh\" and the Tortillas were clearly just made.  Sharing one dish came out to a perfect proportion with a small lunch size leftover to take home along with Salsa.  Awesome find, we will definitely be back.  On a sad note, they do not serve alcohol."}
{"text":"Order to go!  Definitely authentic and they don't speak much English.  But the service is friendly.  They even let me try the barbacoa when I asked what it tasted like while looking over the menu.  The flavors in their tacos really come through.  Chicken tacos are spicy all by themselves, and the guacamole is very simple, mostly avocado and lime juice.  But I will throw in a few dings for the table seating which consists of metal fold up chairs, booth seats that are all torn up, and there was even a rusty nail sticking out of the side of one of them.  But the booths are still the best way to go if you insist on dining in.    The cuts of meat could be a lot better.  This is not going to become a regular place for me because I'm picky.  But I'll mark it down as an interesting experience and recommend it to anyone who wants to give them a go.  \"You should try it, but it's not for me...\""}
{"text":"best MX food in Charlotte area.  Offer both Tex-Mex and authentic cuisine.  REAL TACOS and they are amazing.  Loaded with meat for great price.    I always order carnitas, chorizo, and pastor tacos."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Mexican food, one of the best we have found around the area. Would probably get food to go vs eat here so we can have a beer with our food (who doesn't want alcohol with their Mexican food)."}
{"text":"Awesome 'hole in the wall' taco place! Taco's are cheap and fresh! Service is fantastic as they are always super nice! They bring assorted salsa to the table which is always cool and they keep you filled up on chips which is always a plus for me when I'm not constantly asking for more for the kids! Don't miss this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"What a great find !! Like everyone says- don't judge the location.  You will find great, fresh,  Mexican food at a good price.  Bonus - yummy complimentary cheese dip with the chips and salsa!!"}
{"text":"There is no reason to eat at any other restaurant in Indian Trail. La Unica is simply the best.   The service is great, the newly remodeled interior is roomy, well lit and just all-around pleasant.   The real gem is of course the food. In probably close to 100 times eating here over the past 6 years I've never had anything I didn't like. If you are in the mood for something a little different try either the Pollo a la Crema or the lunch chicken soup.   The only minor quibble I have is the flour tortillas. They are just Mission tortillas. Fresh and always warm of course but nothing special. But short of making tortillas themselves I'm not sure what they can do, it's not like there is a tortilla bakery in the area."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of praises for this place so I decided to give it a shot. It's off the beaten path and looks like a hole in the wall but the food was out of this world. The have fresh salsa's and great specialty dishes. The prices are very reasonable and you get what you pay for on service but the food makes up for it. This is not your typical Mexican joint, its definitely on par with what you would find in Texas..."}
{"text":"This is the spot! Come here once a week. Margaritas are huge, carnitas tacos are always amazing, and free cheese dip!"}
{"text":"Super super super fast service!!  Loves the selection of salsas and queso. I disagree with other reviews about the service being subpar because we had great service. Good food, good prices and there are very authentic Mexican menu choices. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed La Unica, but I was disappointed they did not have alcohol. I really was in the mood for a margarita. The service wasnt great but ok. One salsa was hot and one mild which we quickly found out. I had the pollo quesadillas Mexican style.  The food was good and cheap."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since they opened and I cannot find anything wrong with them. I cannot understand why some people want to throw them under the bus when they have only been there once or twice. They may not be the best in the country but they are the best in this part of the country. Why are you eating at this place, find you didnt like it then head to another Mexican restaurant? Doesnt make sense unless you eat like a sumo wrestler? Why cant you just say you didnt like the place and the reason and leave it at that? You just have to go the extra mile and muddy it up dont ya? Look at the high marks - it speaks for itself people. 1 or two sourpusses just shows the rest of us were glad La Unica is a success!"}
{"text":"Holy cow this was good. The chips are fresh and just thick enough. The service is fast and proficient. Really good food and portions."}
{"text":"Wanted to try it after reading and hearing about being the best Mexican Restaurant in the area. To me it was not great but it was not bad either. I will go back and try a different dish."}
{"text":"If you're still searching the Charlotte Metro East for honest-to-goodness Mexican food for cheap, this your \"ultima parada\" (last stop).  Most people quickly dismiss a strip mall restaurant where the anchor is a Food Lion, but the proof is in the flavor.  The chips are hot and fresh and they offer several kinds of salsa-mild and spicy.  You can even order tomatillo salsa.  The queso dip is little pricey but SOO good.  I normally order the tacos.  Their tacos are two small flour tortillas with minced meat (pork-'al pastor', carne asada, chicken, or BEEF TONGUE) with a little cilantro and onion.  The meats are overflowing on these little treasures.  I think they run about $1.50 a pop.  The rice is not dried out like other Mexican chains and the taco salad puts those Cali-Mex chains, like Chipotle's, to shame!    La Unica has fast service, friendly staff, and are usually busy on weekends.  Regardless of when you go, you can expect prompt service.  Keep in mind that this particular La Unica doesn't serve alcohol.  But you can fill up on quality Mexican cheaper than a Toxic Bell combo...word to your madre!!!"}
{"text":"Anybody that gives this less than five stars- well they are just not giving it straight. This is good food - authentic Mexican, and a really good price. And so much food comes to your table even before you have ordered - I had five big half carafes of different types of salsa, and all of it was fresh. And that's before I ordered - that stuff is all free on the table. I mean, I would pay good money to get salsa - fresh salsa - like this at other Mexican restaurants. Here, I get it just because I walked in the door.  The vegetarian burrito was light, but also very tasty- this place is the real deal."}
{"text":"love this restaurant and the owner and staff are very nice. food is always delicious, hot, fast, and reasonably priced, cheaper than other similar restaurants in the area. great place to take the family, friends. i always get tacos here FAVORITE. if you are from Indian Trail, everyone knows where to go to get the best Mexican food."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food in Charlotte! I go out of my way to go here whenever the craving hits and it never disappoints me. I love the vegetarian options and the queso! My only qualm is that you can't be seated until your whole party is present -- which is kind of a drag if you're meeting up with a bunch of people. Worth it though!"}
{"text":"LOVE this food. Most authentically Mexican food I've found in a long time. This is not tex-mex... it is authentic and oh, so good!  Try the beef tongue. It only costs about a dollar, and will open your eyes to a new cut of meat! The tongue is tender and flavorful, it tastes like braised stew meat.  Every single thing I've gotten here is just incredible. It is so fresh, so tasty... great, now I'm hungry!  My only complaint is no alcohol.  ** Edit: They've expanded! So now there won't be such long waits to get to incredible tasty tacos!"}
{"text":"Hallelujah! This Southern California girl has found authentic Mexican food in Charlotte! After visiting many a restaurant that says Mexican but only to find Tex-Mex, La Unica was a welcome find!   My benchmark for Mexican food is always carnitas and La Unica's carnitas are excellent - tender chunks of pork with crispy edges - it's so good.  Their rice and beans are excellent too.  Their salsas are fantastic.  For spicy food lovers, be sure to ask for the salsa verde!  It is hike to get out there but the food is definitely worth it.  The service is nice and friendly and FAST!  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food use to be really good and was probably the best place to eat Mexican in a 100 miles radius.  Service had gotten shittier over the last 6 months.   Be careful with the salsa as it is shared all day long and just topped off.  Water taste like it has pine-sol in it.  Today will be the last time I go here after my plate came out cold besides my meat.  Not sure how I am suppose to eat cold food.    The servers only seem to care about the other fellow Hispanics that are there.  Take your family else where. We use to eat here all the time but had been trying to give place a fair chance again but they constantly are rude and the food had went down 90%."}
{"text":"This was good Mexican food. I decided to try something I had never had before (I forget what it was called) and I was glad I did. My wife ordered a torta, and raved about the bread. La Unica is a little out of the way for us, but worth it if we are in the mood for Mexican. It was fast and relatively inexpensive."}
{"text":"THE WORST MEXICAN FOOD!!! AND SERVICE!!!! 1st and last time there. Food was horrific . Rice had to much garlic or condiment and texture was nasty. It seems like they have the dishes ready , but sitting under a hot lamp. Every dish we ordered had no taste/or to much.  My son didn't even touch his burrito. What a waste!!! Horrible, Horrible. I get upset because being Mexican/American we can do much better. These people just got lucky they have a crowd !!! Really NC there are better REAL MEXICAN PLACES (AZTECA) is the place. Good luck!!!!"}
{"text":"great food,  great service! loves the varieties of salsa, Pico and cheese dip!! all complimentary too!!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible. The food was okay. The chips and salsa not so good. Pick de gallo delicious. Beware if you are in a large group with children. Our waitress delivered a horchata to one of the children even though she didn't order it. The child asked the waitress why she was given it and ignored. The child told me.  I asked the waitress if it was free and told no. I told the waitress to take it away and she questioned why I would not want the child to have something to drink.  13 of us crammed around three small tables and we all ordered full meals. When we asked for two additional baskets of just chips we were charged. (We had been served only three baskets when we arrived.)  This location is not owned by the folks who own the Indian Trail La Unica. The service and food is much better at the La Unica on Monroe Rd & Waxhaw-Indian Trail Rd location in Indian Trail."}
{"text":"We dine here often because it is good, fast and cheap. ?..and very nearby. It isn't the best Mexican food in the area, but close. Friendly staff, high health rating consistently (which is really important).  I like that they give fresh limes with the salsa and chips."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food around. I'd give it 5 stars if it served beer. But the food is off the wall. Very authentic and fresh!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. We patronize the Indian trail resturant  often. The food was as good as its sister Resturant. They did provide more salsa and condiments then the Indian trail Resturant. The plus is they serve Cervesa and margaritas! The only down side was our server was slow. Overall... My new favorite Mexican Resturant!"}
{"text":"My friend showed me this place for its tacos and it was really good, if you pick the right stuff. I like their sauces and chips that they leave to munch on while we wait. The sanitation and its rating is something I would watch out for though. The service is on and off. One time, we had someone who didn't pay attention to us much and another time where someone was very sweet. All in all, try it and maybe you'll like it."}
{"text":"Wow!  Yes, I had trouble finding this unassuming place, but I'm so glad I succeeded.  We had chimichangas and enchiladas suizas, and wow, it's the best Mexican food I've had in NC!  I took it for take out, and it was ready in 5 minutes.  The staff was friendly, and the prices very reasonable.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Noooo good, trust me im a mexican and there food was not that good. Salsa was watery and didnt taste good, tacos was no good, quesadilla was nasty and the beans was nasty. My kids didnt even want it."}
{"text":"Amazing; I go here often but my mother who is in town infrequently requests to go here every time she makes the trip.  My two year old loves the rice and beans.  The service to the fresh salsas are amazing.   They have had to expand three times in the last five years.  That speaks for itself!"}
{"text":"They have FREE QUESO!!!! Always awesome! It's always been lunch for me and always consistent. Speedy gonz. for me and the portions here a slightly bigger...just an added plus..Authentic and great service. Definite repeat!"}
{"text":"We were looking for good Mexican food since moving to Charlotte from southern California. It seems that we found it. Superb authentic Mexican food in a family setting. Really, really good. Recommended."}
{"text":"First of all, this place is usually crowded so you might want to go early. Starting with the chips and salsa, you know you're in the right  place when you have four salsa's to choose from AND cheese dip. All of which are mighty tasty. Entrees aren't too shabby either. My fave is anything with the carne asada. Muy delicioso!"}
{"text":"Most authentic Mexican food in town. It's my favorite Mexican place to eat with the family."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in town!  Everything is fresh, fast, and delicious, hubby and I are here at least once a week.  Victor is the best!  Portions are large, lunch specials are fabulous."}
{"text":"I didn't enjoy La Unica it definitely didn't live up to the hype. We got to the restaurant at 745 and it was packed at first it was looked like people out the door but quickly find out it's pay on the way out which is right by the door so we had people camped up trying to pay people waiting on their seats and no one at the host stand. We stood there for at least 5 minutes before the girl took our name. We sat down to wait a few minutes later she came over and said what's your name and how many? Wait, what I just told you and you wrote it down, then a few minutes later they called my name we stood up and she said never mind we don't have your table ready yet. Not a great way to start, we finally got to our seats and the waiter came asked for drinks and I ordered my standard  guacamole he brought back the drinks and guac so fast we hadn't had time to look at the menu  he said order now or wait we said wait little did we know wait would be 15 minutes later. The guacamole, which is 3.99 was brought on a plate who can scoop dip onto a chip on a plate? And it wasn't good at all and there serving was petite. I wanted a burrito dinner, but I couldn't find it on the menu so when we finally tracked down a waitress not our waiter because he still had not come back she said she would take our order. I asked about a burrito dinner and she so no just burritos so I had to order my rice separate. The food was out of the kitchen in less than 5 minutes and we did enjoy our entrees my friend got authentic asada tacos. Our original waiter finally came back and asked if we were ok and filled our drinks don't know where he went for so long but oh well. If you are a guac lover like myself this isn't your place and if you want consistent friendly service this isn't your place. It's definitely not mine!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent!!!   And fast service...although they could be a bit nicer!"}
{"text":"So ya I have never understood why this place is so busy. Never liked it. Only come here to meet a friend that has to lunch close to work. But today I got here ten minutes before her and they refused to seat me!  Mind you it was not during lunch hour. The restaurant was empty. Just wanted to sip my Coke and read a book in air conditioning while I waited for my friend to arrive. Absolutely ridiculous!  Could see if it was a full restaurant or from 12-1 or 6-7 or something but just a stupid policy they had to enforce when it made no sense to the customer. But clearly they don't care about the customer. There are sooooo many better Mexican restaurants in town! Better yet go next door to El Cafetal. Amazing food!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this location doesn't have a Yelp page yet! It's been here for years. Oh well, I'm happy to spread the good word.  Don't let the ramshackle outer appearance of this place deter you from stepping inside. So often the dingiest of dives have the best food. And from my experience, this is most true of Mexican restaurants. Besides, that's what sanitation ratings are for, and they always score in the 90s. Tacos aren't meant to be fancy; they're street food. Who really cares if the building needs some fresh paint? As far as I'm concerned, for this sort of place, a lack of attention to architectural and interior design just means the proprietor has more time to focus on great food and service.  As for the food, I wish I could recommend more of their offerings but I've only ever tried one thing: tacos al pastor! It's the quintessential Mexican street taco; heavily seasoned pork sliced off a vertical spit like gyro meat and served simply with diced onion and cilantro in small corn tortillas. They're almost as good as the ones in Mexico. The only thing they're missing are the shavings of grilled pineapple chipped off the top of the spit with a machete and caught in the tortilla like a baseball in a catchers mitt. Still delicious!   Just beware the salsa. I love spicy food and can take just about any level of heat you're likely to encounter in restaurants in the US, but one of the three salsas they bring to your table is the stuff of nightmares. After taking a small taste with a tortilla chip and thinking my manliness sufficient to the task, I decided to pour some on one of my tacos. It wasn't until I got a substantial amount that I realized just what a mistake I'd made. Sweet Jesus, it was like the devil was humping a neutron star on my tongue! No amount of soda or plain tortilla chips seemed to help. My love of tacos al pastor (and perhaps my sense of pride) wouldn't allow me to let the taco go to waste. So instead I spent the whole drive home wondering if I could reliably gargle liquid nitrogen without swallowing.   Keep this in mind and you'll have a great meal here for barely more than you'd pay at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"So good they don't need your business. They must be. I'm afraid I couldn't tell you. I looked them up Sunday evening and called to see when they closed. After being told 9pm, my girlfriend and I drove 8 miles just to walk in and be told they were closed. It was 7:45! Sorry, but that bears repeating. It was 7:45! The open sign was still on and the sign on the door clearly stated that they close at 10pm el Domingo. So unless Domingo has come to mean something other than Sunday since I studied Spanish, their open sign lacks an off switch or the restaurant exists in some Einsteinian time warp, they turned down paying customers hours before closing time. I'll leave it to you to decide which is more likely. I for one, will take my money somewhere it's actually appreciated."}
{"text":"By far the nastiest, dirtiest dirt Mex I have ever had. The beef is all steak, there is no ground beef, the queso was watery and thin, chips were burned, they didn't provide any salsa with the guac and chips, and there was a twist tie in my burrito supreme mixed in with the meat which I assume was from the packaged tortillas they use and were too careless to notice it had fallen in with the food. The guac was also very salty and tasted like salt and lime were the only ingredients mixed together. A piece of the steak in my sons enchiladas had a HUGE fatty piece on it, which I cannot believe they felt was OK to even serve in the first place. All 3 of us that managed to eat even half of the dinner were sick later that night. Nasty, nasty, nasty. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick authentic meal. The place is a Mexican blue plate. Atmosphere has improved since the last time we ate here but still not the kind of place to impress a date or stop in for a beer because they don't sell it but the food and staff are great!"}
{"text":"PASS on the Veggie Fajitas! I just paid $8.99, yes, that is really nine dollars, for a grilled onion, canned mushrooms, and a strip of bell pepper.  The onion was not even the thin, almost caramelized grilled onion, but it was in square chunks that were too thick to be really done.  The mushrooms were canned, I know, bc they were rubbery and did not brown and shrink up like fresh ones.  The first tortilla I took out of the aluminum foil broke in half down the middle bc it had been wrapped so far ahead of time.  I just looked at the plate like, are you serious, these are veggie fajitas?  If a very sketch place like Miguel's at the Bradley Motel on the west side has fresh veggies, including squash and zucchini...enough said.  the two stars are for the Burrito Tijuana and the breakfast burrito with chorizio.  In these hard economic times, I do not like to feel like I was cheated.  If I had not been with a friend I did not want to embarrass who goes there all the time, I would have spoken up to the manager..."}
{"text":"La Unica is a local gem in Monroe, I never would have knew it existed if it wasn't from word of mouth. Half a mile from US 74, it's in an unassuming building in an unassuming neighborhood. But the food is phenomenal. They're always crowded every time I come, and the service is always average, never spectacular. Their parking lot has an abundance of potholes. Despite my qualms, their food is legendary. I like that they serve you several salsas with varying degrees of heat and queso as soon as you sit down. I like that they have authentic Mexican dishes, just try one of their tacos de lengua and you'll know what I mean. Everything I've had at La Unica has been flavorful and fresh. I've tried many things on their menu but I always seem to go back to their fajitas and pollo con crema. I don't really need to elaborate anymore, the fact is that in my opinion, La Unica is the best Mexican restaurant I've been to. If you're anywhere in the Union County area, it's well worth the trip."}
{"text":"I'll give 3 stars because the taco was good. We try the burrito but not a fan. This place get busy so go early. Lack of parking space. The waitress took awhile to come get our orders but we had chip and salsa to at table when arrived."}
{"text":"A definite must for authentic Mexican in the Charlotte area!   You start off with chips and cheese dip with 3 different salsas. Let me just say, the service is amazing! They are so quick and if you are low on anything they refill it so quickly.   We went for lunch and the prices were super reasonable. I ordered the fajitas off the lunch menu for $6.. And the servings are more than generous.   I will definitely drive the 45 minutes from Charlotte to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here for the first time today with my two teenage daughters and found everything to be just average at best. Chips were a little stale and salsa was unexciting; however, the cheese dip (at $3.99) was creamy and quite good. I went with a simple enchilada and burrito combo with rice and beans for $8.79. It did arrive quickly, and although I enjoyed the enchilada's mole sauce, I found the burrito's red sauce to be somewhat bland. The chicken was tender but also lacked flavor and, while not lukewarm, was not hot enough for me temperature-wise  Service was okay and sanitary rating was fine. Atmosphere is dated and a little worn. Like I said, everything was average and there are just too many better Mexican options around for me to return for \"average\", but hey let's face it, based upon their fan-base they don't really need me anyway."}
{"text":"Really really good Mexican food and this is coming from a Mexican Arizonan! Carnitas were some of the best I've ever had! No cervezas or margaritas served here is my one caveat."}
{"text":"This is a very clean restaurant with great food and great service. The lunch menu is a great value for the price. Although everyone enjoyed their individual orders, I was particularly impressed with my taco. It was freshly fried and super crisp. The beef inside was quite flavorful. Highly recommended this restaurant."}
{"text":"Friendly service, great food. Went out on a limb and tried the Caldo de Mariscos (fish soup)...it was delicious! This place is a bit off of the beaten path, but completely worth it! Complimentary queso, Pico, all sorts of salsas. Very good."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday lunch yesterday and had the best salad with chicken and ordered a side of tacos (super fresh and delicious) rest of the family had burritos and other Mexican dishes, cannot complain about anything, the orchata was on point and also tasted fresh. I would hands down recommend this place for authentic Mexican any day.  !!"}
{"text":"Just in town for training, came across this place on Yelp. Came inside, the staff was helpful and nice. The chips and salsa was excellent and our enchiladas were on point! When I come back here to train, I'll make sure to come back here. AUTHENTIC!!! Highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants around. They're fast, friendly and have great customer service. It's never a long wait for your meal, refills of chips and beverages are frequent and come without the request. Food is delicious, as well!"}
{"text":"This place is CRAZY busy most of the time. Good food, great service, and very fast turnaround make this an Indian Trail favorite. My only complaint about the restaurant would be that while the food is always good, there is nothing original about anything on the menu. Otherwise, very family friendly, polite staff, and always consistent preparation make this a solid choice for a reasonably-priced meal for small and large parties alike."}
{"text":"Finally - a place to go for good Mexican food that answers the question \"Why am I paying so much for a fork and plate?\"   All good.  (Joke Hint: Most Mexican food is all the same but for the fork and plate - and the price)."}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed eating here. Service is prompt and large portions at a very reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Food - 2/2 *Simply the best traditional Mexican food in all of Charlotte.  My favorite item to order is the Fajita Steak Nachos.  The steak is so savory and delicious.  The chips and salsa that they bring out are excellent.  They'll bring you both mild and hot and watch out because the hot is HOT!  I end up mixing the two together.  I've never had anything here I didn't like.  Service - 1/1 *Fast and very friendly.  Some of the staff are some of the most personable and friendly staff I've ever had.  You're food will come out fast!  Price - 1/1 *Appropriately price in the $7-13 range.  Atmosphere - 1/1 *You don't expect much.  This is a hole-in-the-wall and I wouldn't change anything about it.  They recently expanded and it's made a huge difference for traffic flow.  This place is always busy.  We've learned you need to arrive before 6pm or you better be prepared to wait.  Side note- traffic coming down Old Monroe from Matthews is horrible around 6pm.  It could take you 30 minutes to get to La Unica from the 485 exit.  Overall- my favorite traditional, authentic Mexican food.  I find myself craving this food.  It's the best."}
{"text":"We've generally gone to La Unica in Indian Trail at least once per week since they opened.  We've always been happy with the food and service.  But last night's experience was enough that we may not go back.  Since they remodeled, their service has been worse.  I've thought perhaps it was because the restaurant is so much larger now.  But we're always having to ask for more chips and salsa whereas we used to never have to ask.  And I know they've always wanted the entire party to be there before they seat you.  But last night my wife and I arrived but my wife was in the parking lot right outside of the door to the restaurant talking to her parents that were leaving at the time.  I went in, said 2 for dinner and the hostess looked around me and said is the 2nd one here?  I said yes and pointed to her through the glass door talking to her parents and said she would be right in.  She said I'm sorry but I can't seat you until she's in the building.  I couldn't believe it.  I said \"But she's right there\" and the lady said she still couldn't seat us.  So I opened the door and told my wife she would have to come in before we could be seated.  As I say, we've been there many times and generally love the wait staff, particularly Victor.  But we may not go back after being treated so rudely.  And the hostess knows us because we are there so much.  I think the rule is ridiculous when one of the party is literally within feet of their door!!!"}
{"text":"The Hot Salsa is very Hot, the mild Salsa is very Mild, Both were VERY Good!  They give you some Lime Wedges - In my Bowl I mixed a three parts Mild Salsa with one part Hot and a squeeze of Lime Juice!  My Girlfriend had a Chicken Chimichanga... I'm not sure I have ever tasted one of these and I know I do not want one again... She said it was very good!  My Soft Pulled Pork Taco was very Good and the Hard Ground Beef Taco was good!  Our Server was GREAT!  She knew we would not like certain things and would like others!   Mr. Union County Physique World told me there is Mexican Food and there is Mexican Food, this would be the later!  Mr. Hoy Approved!"}
{"text":"I love this place but I have to say its goin down hill when I came in to eat all the waitresses was at the front table eating and working at the same time and to me that is nasty.. and I waited forever on my waitress to bring me things... have to say its goin to be a while before I come back..."}
{"text":"The food was bad quality. There was flies every where. I didnt get what I ordered.. and the air wasn't on."}
{"text":"Everything is so fresh that they must have a garden in the kitchen. The food is fantastic, and the prices are even better. Before you even order, you get a meal's worth of cheese, salsa, chips and other sauces."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in town! They have great lunch specials, and delicious salsas,"}
{"text":"Everything was delicioso. Four salsas, queso, pico de gallo all brought out when you have a seat. The food is superb. Camarones a la diabla were the perfect mix of spicy and flavorful."}
{"text":"We had read really amazing things about the food here but it was just so-so and overpriced at that. We had the no name dinner and the chicken fajitas. Overall, we just felt the price didn't reflect the quality of the dishes. The service was very good and fast."}
{"text":"Okay so this is another place that I would have never walked into but so glad I did. My sisters live close and took me once and now I have to stop by every time I am out that way.   There always seems to be a little bit of a wait, usually around 20 minutes, but definitely worth it. Once you are seated they serve you pretty quickly. This place is small and it's always packed. Their food is the best! They bring you chips and different salsas to start. If you aren't afraid of spicy food ask them for the avocado salsa; its a green salsa that is usually made super hot but can be tamed when mixed with their other salsas. Their chips are always hot and taste fresh like their dishes. I usually get anything with Carne Asada because they make it better than anywhere else.   I wish they had a full bar because a good mojito would make this place perfect :)!"}
{"text":"This could be the best Mexican food in North Carolina. We just moved from Southern CA and and been on the hunt for authentic Mex.   This is it!!"}
{"text":"First off I hate Mexican food but sometimes I can find something on the menu that I can deal with I tried some chicken crap on their menu next thing I know I'm leaving the store feeling like I'm going to puke it tasted old and nasty and gross hated it and then some ladies were speaking in Spanish like they think I can't understand them I hated it and we were sitting like right beside this party I guess it was like someone's birthday party maybe going on and then come to find out this stupid place you don't get refills with your soft drinks you get a can that's it and the place isn't cheap the rice sucks but don't count my review I guess because I actually hate Mexican food so I guess I'm being kind of bias right now sorry but that's just my review and technically I don't think typical Mexican food taste like their crap... also I forgot to mention I feel like I gave myself a third degree burn on their freaking plate hot as crap like you can't even touch to put yourself and I was sitting at the very end of the table like there was a table and then they pushed it towards the booth so it was three people on the other side of it so the server had to pushed their way in front of the two people sitting beside me to put the plate down with their oven mitts because no one could touch that place and then you even got close to it you would burn the snot out of yourself me and one other person. We got 3rd degree burns it was so hot but yes some of the food does come out kind of cold and it sucks when you got a freakin 10000 degree plates that in front of you that after a while it cools down yes but we going to move it and it stuck to the table cuz it got so hot we had to like get it off of it was suction cup to the table it was so hot!!!!"}
{"text":"I've always said the sign of a great restaurant is when you go a million times and it is always consistently good. My husband and I've been to La Unica probably as many times and always had a great experience. The food is wonderful, the staff is wonderful, and it seems they are expanding to help with the crowd that is always waiting to be seated. I love this place, everyone needs a place they guarantee they will get a great meal."}
{"text":"This restaurant is big a surprise!!  The exterior of the building definitely does not match the quality of their food. They have unbelievable salsa, and wonderful dishes!!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Recommend: the Chimichangas, churros with chocolate or strawberry, the pollo fondidio, and the Mexican burrito, and get a Jarito. :) Used to be the best place to go for Mexican food, but not so much anymore. We have been going for about a year, give or take a few months.  After the renovations, they look prettier and have more room, but seem to now be lacking in the service and quality. The menu has changed some since we first started going, which is great, I love some mix up and most of the new stuff we have tried isn't bad, but it's not great either.  Food is okay, nothing compared to when we first started going though. It never comes out hot anymore. Our chips are completely gone by the time the food comes and the beans always have a film from where they have been sitting for a while waiting to come to the table.  The servers are normally nice, but you will see them first thing when you sit down for your drink order, when they bring your drinks back they will want to take your food order, and if your not ready they will come back about 2 minutes later and you probably won't see them stop at your table again until they bring you the bill. It's very hard to get refills on drinks unless you flag them down-which can be hard to do! We will probably keep going to La Unica when we don't feel like cooking, but it defiantly won't be the 1/week we used to go."}
{"text":"My go to Mexican dive when I'm on this side of town.   Always delicious fast and affordable.   Baja Mexican style dishes."}
{"text":"Food is not good. You'd be better off going to the grocery store and getting a frozen burrito."}
{"text":"Taqueria La Unica serves your standard Tex-Mex. What is an unassuming restaurant on the outside, is quite busy inside and serves excellent food.  SERVICE: The service was decent. Our chips and salsa were served as we were sitting down and our food orders were taken shortly after and served promptly. We were never asked how the food tasted, which is fine by me, but may be bothersome to others. Also, the drink refilling was a bit slow. The waitstaff seemed to be understaffed.  FOOD: Most of the menu is your standard Tex-Mex, but the taste is certainly better than most places. One unique food menu item that Taqueria La Unica serves is small tacos for under $2 a piece. This is a great way to sample many different taco fillings and toppings. I wish that they would season their meat a bit more, though. Salt was definitely lacking.  PRICE: The prices are overall very fair, but then again Tex-Mex is fairly inexpensive food. If you get a combination plate, you may have to pay an extra $1 for rice and beans, which I find a bit odd and unreasonable, but otherwise, the prices are very fair.  I enjoyed my visit to Taqueria La Unica and will certainly return. You may want to show up a bit early, as it can get very busy in the evenings."}
{"text":"Service is ok, only if u know Spanish. Shrimp quesadilla is no good, the tiny mini steam shrimp in between two piece of tortillas.   I don't think I would go back."}
{"text":"Probably my go to for Mexican eats as it is close, fast and always clean. Having eaten Mexican in El Paso,  San Antonio Tx and several places in California, I can say this is on par with those experiences. IMHO Best and most authentic tacos - pastor, Barbacoa, and carnitas served with a grilled jalapeño and a grilled onion.  Salsa is tasty enough - Which like Italian, i guess it depends on what you like. Best pastor I have ever eaten.  Beans are too runny for my taste. Camerones al chipotle is an interesting dish though the shrimp are routinely cooked a little too long. Mole de Puerco and Pollo con Mole are probably my two main courses. Pretty tasty mole.     Just recently got a liquor license serving beer and margaritas."}
{"text":"This place looks like a hole in the wall on the outside but it's actually quite spacious inside. It's always busy but we are seated quickly. I have seen other reviews state that the waitresses are rude but I have not experienced that. I'm not saying they are overly friendly but definitely not rude. The free chips, salsa and queso are great but out of the 4 salsas that are brought to the table only 1 is edible because the other 3 are so hot. That's a matter of personal preference though. It's free though so I'm not complaining. The food is brought out quickly and is always really good. I highly recommend the enchiladas verdes with steak filling. The prices are also very reasonable. My only complaint is that when you go to pay you have to go to the front counter which is in a very small cramped area with people waiting to be seated and people waiting to pay. It can get a little chaotic but the line does move quickly. This place will definitely stay in our Friday night rotation, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Just looking at the outside of the building you may not even consider going in but the food is awesome. Great Hispanic food. You know it is good and not your typical american restaurant when there are lots of Latinos eating there too. Salsa is hot hot hot. Something for everyone from mild to wild. Chicken fish veggies and even beef tongue. This one is a keeper."}
{"text":"This is the best in the metro area!!! They don't sell liquor and still packed all time. My favorites: Best Chicken Tortilla Soup anywhere! Also the Tortas Carnitas are awesome. The Parrillada Mexicana Pork, chicken, steak, shrimp, Mexican sauce & cactus is a must too. Oh and Ceviche.. fresh each day"}
{"text":"The chips and salsa are very good. The tacos are served with just the right portion of cilantro....muy bien! Beware the grilled jalepenos. They start off sweet but will set all but the most experienced ablaze!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mexican establishments that I have ever visited. I have eaten at La Unica twice (about a year apart). My flight into Charlotte was delayed and, instead of arriving at 4pm, I did not get in until almost 7. But my business associate who picked me up at the airport knew that a visit to La Unica was high on my priority list. He took back roads and got us there by 7:30.  What has struck me about both visits is the fact that this place is packed - both visits on weeknights (a packed restaurant is always a good sign).  The chips and salsa are great and they bring you both mild and hot salsa (I mix the two). I like the burrito combination - one beef and one chicken. The food is very tasty and served piping hot.  It's certainly not fancy. But the quality of the food MORE than makes up for the no-frills atmosphere. The service is very good; maybe not outstanding but certainly at least very good. But, again, it is the food that is the star here.  I thought that I would throw this in: They do accept credit/debit cards but not American Express.  Another visit to La Unica will be high on my to-do list for my next visit to Charlotte."}
{"text":"The food was good. I really liked the hard shell tacos. Service was quick and polite for the most part. Strange rule that they will not seat you until everyone in your party is there."}
{"text":"If you never find another Mexican place in Charlotte, don't worry - you don't have to!  La Unica is fantastic.  Always fresh, quick, and delicious.  They immediately stock your table with two types of salsa (medium and hot!), limes and crispy wonderful chips.  Then you glance over the menu - I always get the tacos - and boom, best Mexican food ever.  They are located in a little strip mall, but just renovated the restaurant and it's gorgeous on the inside.  They made the space bigger, added more tables, and painted murals all over the walls.  I love this restaurant, and am so happy that we found it.  It's not the fanciest place, but it'll keep you coming back."}
{"text":"Raised in Oklahoma with real Mexican food, this is a good as it gets.  We drive from the Marvin area weekly to enjoy the food.  The green salsa for the chips is amazing albeit a tad on the hot side.  Tacos are like eating street food in Baja.  Carnitas are spot on, and the guisado is like the little old woman down the street made from my childhood.  Teamwork makes for quick service, and the kitchen executes with great speed."}
{"text":"I stopped I stopped into this place on a whim and my tummy walked out happy! I was seated promptly and brought out three types of salsas the green one was the best It's super spicy! After that I ordered two tacos. My tacos were awesome!! When I eat out I prefer to eat vegan so my tacos included lettuce, tomatoes, onions, refried beans, cilantro and guacamole! If you never been here check it out! Oh and by the way the prices are super reasonable!!!!"}
{"text":"Not quite sure what all the rave is about this place.   We sat down on a mid Sunday afternoon, had to flag down a waitress to get our drinks.   We ordered a choriqueso which was quite good but the cheese dip was way too watery / liquid.   I ordered tacos with chorizo and asada. They were very bland and quite ordinary.  The rice and beans I ordered were also bland and ordinary.   My date ordered a torta and she said it was decent.   Slow service and bland food I've had much better ( and at visually more appealing restaurants)"}
{"text":"Had to stop by a local place since I was STARVING on the way to Charlotte. I recently took a liking for authentic Mexican tacos, and this place looked like the real deal. I ordered a carnitas taco la unica (with all the toppings) and a horchata while my dad ordered a barbacoa taco. I didn't get to try the barbacoa, but I can tell you the smell can make your mouth water. I drizzled the green hot sauce on the carnitas, which makes it more flavorful. The meat was chunky, fatty, crispy at some parts, and plentiful. I'm glad I got the taco la unica because it gives you more bite. The horchata had more cinnamon than what I'm used to, but it was still yummy! Made a good decision to stop by here!"}
{"text":"If they told me the truth, they now have a new restaurant in the clarion hotel on carowinds blvd. across from the park..... delicious!!!"}
{"text":"We have always had good food here but Saturday night both my wife n I were sick by the time we got home. Very very sick"}
{"text":"Stopped here coming back from the and it was awesome. Our waitress was sweet and pretty and made sure we were well taken care of while we there.  The food and $6 Patron Margaritas were outstanding.  We can't wait to go back and we will make this place a tradition!"}
{"text":"The very best food. I have been eating at la unica since they opened. Delicious food and great hospitality."}
{"text":"Certainly not a horrible restaurant but I'm not eager to return. Service was sub-par, with the hostess getting our drinks, and the waitress assuming we were ready to order after waiting on her for over 10 minutes. The food came quickly and portion size was plentiful, but I would rather visit other Mexican restaurants for more authentic food."}
{"text":"Very average dishes. Bland rice. No refried beans with the steak dinner, however the bowl of beans was very well spiced and good. The steak itself was decent. My sister said her enchiladas verdes were very good. I had a combination plate of a tostada, taco, and enchilada. It was all okay.  Relocated here from Chicago and we are still on the search for a real good taqueria that serves up some carne asada that is tender, well seasoned, and juicy. The food here is passable but it's not great enough for us to want to return. However, it is probably better than others in the area so give it a try."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Consistently provides good food fast and at a reasonable price. I have eaten here about once a week for years. The only down side is no beer or margaritas but I love the people and the food"}
{"text":"BEST mexican food in the indian trail area!! I can go to this joint every weekend and never get tired of it. Daily lunch specials are amazing deals and the service is always friendly."}
{"text":"This place is located in a small shopping center that looks a little questionable but this restaurant is a secret gem in the heart of indian Trail.  They changed the inside and instead of a big cafeteria looking restaurant, they added booths, decor and sectioned parts off to make it look more intimate and bigger.  The servers are super friendly and attentive.  They offer two salsas that greet you with chips when you first sit down.  Food is delicious and the portions are very large for the price you pay.  Two thumbs up!! *NOW SERVING ALCOHOL!!  :)"}
{"text":"The salsa - wow!!!! Definitely a great place to have lunch.  I had the lunch chicken fajitas - so good!"}
{"text":"I love carnitas and any time I see a Mexican restaurant I haven't tried I go in a get carnitas. These are the best I have ever had. Fork  tender. I have never had bad food here. I go quite often and I have never been dissatisfied    My mom likes a variety and she has tried many items and has always been happy. Great service and friendly people"}
{"text":"Depends on what authenticy ur looking for. I order the chicken quesadilla. Um, plain tasting was the shredded chicken quesadilla, not enough cheese please. The Mexican rice was cold & plain too , but hey at least the fried beans were actually good & i ate it all, that's a first! I order a steak taco, corn tortilla just to prove myself that the other reviews were valid. Yep they were, it was awesome good this taco! The hot sauce gave it a better kick for very spicy to match the loud mariachi Mexican music playing above me. Husband order lengua tacos, cow tongue for those u don't eat this just like me. He said this place is the better place to get these here. Overall I had 3 waiters...Confusing but they got the job done. Oh and today they didn't take credit cards. Not sure if I'll come back but unless the husband wants lengua...."}
{"text":"Came from out of town to eat with my brother-in-law and we decided on this place. Make sure you bring your appetite because the portions are big and the food is good will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I thought to myself, \"Well this should be an adventure!\" when I pulled up. Doesn't look to great from the outside but I just had a very nice meal thanks to a restaurant.com coupon. I got a the biggest fajita dish I could find! Cooked the crap out of the shrimp, so I recommend just the chicken and steak kind. You get 3 different types of salsa when you sit down, so for a dip fiend like me, that's a positive (although 2 out of the 3 were too hot for me). Their guacamole is excellent. Flan, not so much. Definitely worth a shot though. I see a sign for $1 tacos on Tuesdays which sounds awesome. Will probably come back."}
{"text":"Great food.  First time at this location, although I'd been to the Indian Trail location many times.  Complimentary chips, four different types of salsas in small carafes, and queso, were all excellent.  Chose three different flour tortilla tacos 'La Unica' style, and they were excellent.  Grilled spring onion and grilled hot pepper as garnish.  Killer.  Everything was great, including service and their reasonable prices.  I was stuffed.  Should've told them to bring a half basket of chips :)  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Re-opened! Can't wait to check out the new expanded restaurant! So good they had to buy out the adjacent lots!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant hands down. I will forever love this place not just because of the amazing food, but because of the fast and friendly service too!! I have went here since they first opened years ago, and I have never had a bad experience. I come for my lunch break mostly and always leave full, pleased, and on time back to work."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place accidently and so glad I did. Food is fantastic. Service is great.  I visited on a Tuesday evening and it was packed. One minor comment - if you are traveling on business, La Unica does not accept American Express."}
{"text":"My gf and I go here quite regularly. We are always amazed at how fast the service is and how consistently amazing the food is. The staff is always very friendly and are very quick with the delicious chips and salsa. We HIGHLY recommend this place."}
{"text":"Not worth it. I've been to other la únicas and the service was excellent. I waited over an hour after sitting down to get my food. Would not come back. Server only checked on te table for drinks and to bring the food."}
{"text":"BEWARE IF YOU'RE GETTING A TAKE OUT!!  I ordered 4 soft tacos without the chips.  I asked for extra salsa, 1 ea of hot and mild salsa since I like to mix them.  I get there to pick up the order and after arriving back at home they gave me two bags of chips (which I didn't want), 4 tacos and ONLY 1oz of HOT salsa.  After going back to the restaurant to correct their mistake, they wanted to charge me 2 bucks.  I couldn't believe it!  I paid them two bucks and said I'd never be back.    It's a shame because they're a great restaurant; however, when ordering take outs, they've not a clue.  They're willing to let a good customer drive 15 min back to correct THEIR mistake and still charge them 2 bucks for what was asked for originally. So beware when you order a take out!"}
{"text":"Excellent salsas and food in general. It's a half hour drive from my house but I will be going back. Our order took a long time but I think that was an accident."}
{"text":"Don't go anywhere else for Mexican -- this is the best. We eat here for dinner and lunch with everything simply delicious. Salsa is amazing with both HOT and mild versions. Chips are freshly made and served warm. All menu items are typical Tex Mex -- my favorite is the Arroz con Pollo which you should try...Yum!  Oh by the way the prices are low too."}
{"text":"I was sadly disappointed with this location. I know they have great reviews and have seen how crazy they are during lunch hour, but I was not impressed. They have a very large menu which is typical for this type of establishment, but their were almost no descriptions. This is a big no-no for me. On top of that they serve zero alcohol and I was hoping to enjoy a margarita with my dinner. I will say the service was amazing and fast so we were in an out.   Four of us went for dinner. The gratis chips lacked flavor and cheese that we added was a white queso with some diced peppers, but was just OK. My fellow diner enjoyed their meals, but I was not in the same boat. I'd decided to try a dish from their selection of specials - since it had a description and sounded delicious I ordered was anticipation. Chicken breast grilled with mushroom and onions in a white cream white sauce served with rice, refried beans and tortillas (choice of corn or flour). Unfortunately, the description didn't state the white cream sauce was spicy. This was too spicy for me and ended up switching plates with my husband. He thoroughly enjoyed this why I had a bit of his steak."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. The menus are actually made in mexico and the food is very authentic. Our new place for mexican in Charlotte, you have to try it. Soccer on the TVs Spanish music loud from the juke box. The sauces they have are amazing."}
{"text":"As a Latino newer to the Charlotte area I've been searching for a while to find a authentic place that has some good food.   They have some amazing authentic tacos the carne asada and carnitas are amazing! They have a avocado jalapeño sauce that has a nice kick to it and is amazing on the tacos and with the chips.   I take off one star because it would be nice if they served some grow up drinks. BUT this place is always packed so be prepared to have to wait a little but they are always good about getting people in quick. All in all it's a nice little spot that reminds me of grandmas cooking."}
{"text":"Impressed with the free cheese dip, 4 different salsas, lime wedges and pico de gallo. My enchiladas suizas with chicken fajita and steak fajitas were very good. Loved the huge glasses  filled with ice tea."}
{"text":"I love going to La Unica. The service is great, and the food is better. They offer a pretty typical mexican restaurant menu, but the food is MUCH better than your typical cheap mexican eatery.   Free Chips and Salsa when you are seated, and service is always fast and friendly. Lunch is always quite busy, so you might have to wait for a seat. (Large crowd just shows you that the food is that good!). Due to the lunch rush, they do require that your whole party be there when you are seated."}
{"text":"This place is a must if I'm ever within striking distance. Clearly I'm not alone in my love and adoration by the other reviews on here.  Three words: Authentic. Carnitas. Tacos. Crazy cheap. Crazy delicious."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican on the East Coast! The salsa was spicy, fresh, and authentic. The rice and beans were flavorful. Our entrees were mouth-watering and delicious. The service was friendly and prompt. The prices are very low for the high quality of food you get - an excellent value!  My wife and I lived in Arizona for 18 years and San Diego for 3 years and believe me when I tell you we've been to a lot of Mexican places throughout the years. I can confidently say this is one of the best and most authentic Mexican restaurants we've ever been to."}
{"text":"Thank you La Unica, I was growing so tired of these generic phony Mexican restaurants.  'Would you like a burrito, an enchilada, and a quesadilla or how about an enchilada, a quesadilla, and a burrito?'  How about a chile rellano stuffed with rice, beans and real queso.  Top that with habanera salsa, sour cream, and more cheese (the white crumbles).  You can get that here.    I put on the cowboy boots, sweat like a real rancher, and set my mouth on fire when I eat here.  This is what it is all about.  If you want Mexican food eat it at a place where a lot of Mexicans dine, La Unica."}
{"text":"Excellent quick Mexican food. The Salsas are awesome. We've ordered things that were mediocre and others that are excellent. It can get very busy but wait staff usually works together for quick service. Best Mexican restaurant in Monroe."}
{"text":"This place is soo good and affordable. A friend recommended and so we embarked on a journey here for lunch. This place shares a gravel parking lot with other places. We came around 12:30 on a week day and couldn't find a park in the lot. We eventually found a place and went inside. As soon as we came in we were greeted. The prices were realistic and the portions large. It was clean and the staff were friendly. There is a wide selection of food options on the menu.  The provide a large selection of salsas options to go with the chips when you arrive. The food was great. I had the enchiladas. The food came out at a good temperature and appeared very appeasing. The taste is what made this review. I definitely recommend and will return."}
{"text":"Most authentic Mexican food I have found in Charlotte. I even prefer it to La Unica superstore (the little taco shop inside) off of Independence. Authentic for me is SoCal Mexican food. Right near the Tijuana border.  My kids love that you can get horchata here so that's plus #1. Wish they had beer or margaritas but it's okay, the food is worth them not. Good prices. Very quick getting the food out. I love the beans, although they give you a very small amount when it comes as a side with rice. At least compared to what I'm used to seeing back home. My personal favorite was the authentic tacos, I'd normally refer to them as street tacos but whatevs. They are pretty damn authentic so the name fits. I don't love the fajitas that everyone here raved about. Meat, both chicken and steak, two different times was overdone. Enchiladas good. I still have lots to try on this menu, for now this is my go to Mexican restaurant in Charlotte.  Oh, and the chips and salsa were on point."}
{"text":"I have been enjoying this La Unica location for nearly a decade, and I can safely say it's ruined other Mexican restaurants for me. Nowhere else measures up!  Even during busy hours, I've never had to wait more than five minutes to be seated, no matter the size of my party.   Chips and salsa are delivered right away. I love the mild salsa; the flavor is so good! The chips are served fresh and often still hot. There's a note in he menu that says your first basket of chips is complementary, but additional baskets will be added to your bill. I really think that's just reserved for asshole customers; I've never seen chips on my check unless I've ordered them to go.   The menu, as noted in other reviews, is extensive. I find myself ordering the same handful of dishes over and over (they're so good!) but it would be easy to try something new every time you visit. There's something for everyone, from Tex-Mex to super authentic.   Once your order is in, hot plates are dropped off at lightning speed. My order has always been correct and served at the right temperature. My favorite dish is the chilaquiles, and I've tried all the fajita combinations. And the rice is always perfect.   La Unica is quick, inexpensive, and delicious. I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't enjoy their time here. And seriously, if you have major beef that they don't serve booze, that's a you problem. This place is a gem."}
{"text":"Really, really good. Cheese dip as a free starter is great. They also give you 5 salsas, ranging from very hot to mild. Not sure why they give you only one bowl for five salsas, but I'm sure you could ask for more bowls. Food was delicious and very inexpensive. Service was a tad slow, however that didn't affect my overall dining experience. Would definitely go back the next time I am in town. We need one of these in my local area!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican place around. Excellent service and food! I love the fajitas and the melon water. We eat here at least once a week :)"}
{"text":"Love the different sauces they give u to dip your chips in and u just have to try the barbacoas....absolutely delicious!!"}
{"text":"Really tasty. Large menu. Very quick and very nice waitstaff. Try the sopapillas. No alcohol."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Having lived near the border my entire life, I was totally surprise by the quality of the Mexican food here. I never would have thought I would find such good authentic Mexican food this far from Mexico! The portions were large, served with an array of different salsas, pick de gallo , and queso au gratis. The tacos la unica were great and authentic. I would recommend this place to anyone. Very affordable also!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Mexican restaurant!! The service is always great and the food is always delicious!! I have been dining there for over 15 years!! Best chips and salsa around!!"}
{"text":"As one of my coworkers said, this is where all the (Mexican) landscapers go.  If you like authentic Mexican run by authentic Mexicans, look no further.  They bring FOUR different salsas out with the chips, along with lime wedges!  As uninviting as this place looks on the outside, there is no substitute for authentic food.  The lunch burritos (California burrito and burrito la unica) and lunch enchiladas are great.  When you factor in the price, they're phenomenal.  The shrimp fajitas for dinner are the best I've ever had.  If you're the type that likes Cantina 1511, Don Pedro, Azteca or any of the other countless Americanized Mexican restaurants then you probably won't enjoy this one.  If you're looking to impress your date, then I recommend looking elsewhere.  But if you crave the real deal, with plenty of spice and zest, it doesn't get any better than La Unica.  I've been here with 8-10 coworkers, and the ones that like authentic, spicy food all love it.  The ones that prefer Don Pedro weren't as thrilled.  Oh, and this review applies to the location on South Blvd (in the heart of \"Little Mexico\").  Never got to try the one in Plaza Midwood before it closed."}
{"text":"From the outside, this place doesn't look like much, but once you get inside and try the food, you'll be hooked. It is legit Mexican food. The chips are served with three different sauces, all of which are amazing. The Pollo Fundido is out of this world if you are looking for a good dish to try. I also fancy the hot and spicy shrimp and the everything fajitas. Definitely worth a try!!"}
{"text":"As a Mexican-American with an Abuelita that is a stickler for traditional Mexican food, the hunt for an authentic Mexican restaurant in Charlotte has taken many years. I finally found one that makes chilaquiles, and even better,  just like hers! Chopped fried tortillas covered in a creamy tomato sauce con pollo y queso, this warm and cozy dish took me right back to Abuelita's kitchen in East LA.   My boyfriend and I loved the food so much, I asked him to bring me here for our one year anniversary. I didn't need a $7 frou-frou margarita to celebrate, I needed food my Abuelita would approve and a cold glass of horchata (a sweet rice drink, don't be scared to try , it's great for cooling off the spicy salsa!).  La Unica sits in a surprising location, but the packed tables should tell you this place is worth the drive from Charlotte. If you're looking for traditional, no-frills Mexican, come here!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch on a Saturday with my 2 kids.  Place was bustling with people who knew where to get good, authentic Mexican foods.  The chips and the 3 salsa's were amazing......red salsa, salsa verde and an extremely HOT one that had smoked chilies in it.    I had the Burrito La Unica which was LOADED with chicken, rice, beans, and topped with queso.  This burrito was the real deal, not like any other \"number 15\" on other Mexican restaurants menus.  I was stuffed when I left since I ate the entire thing.  My kids had the cheese and chicken quesadillas and enjoyed them.    The service was excellent, they had plenty of waitresses who made sure the drinks and chips stayed full.  Every so often you fell like eating Mexican, you know?  This is my new go to place.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch last week and got a taco salad - it was nothing to write home about. The portion was fine, but there we no beans (not refried or black) and the lettuce was a little on the brown side.  The best part about this place is they offer you 2 different kinds of salsa with you meal - a smokey, chunky salsa and then a medium, pureed kind. Both we very good, and I found the chunky salsa super addicting.   Don't go during lunch without expecting a 15 minute wait. A little noisy, but a good little spot."}
{"text":"Our go-to lunch place if I can get out of the office long enough to sit down for 30-45 minutes for lunch. Always packed, especially at lunch, but the service is incredible and they turn over tables quickly. Recently renovated and expanded to offer more tables. The chips are always fresh and hot, they give you two kinds of salsa by default, and you can even ask for the spicier one for free. The queso dip and guacamole are great, although the queso is pricy. I think you get what you pay for, though, so that's not a complaint!  The quesadilla and burrito Mexicano are my go-tos, because they have a yummy, fresh tomatillo verde sauce. But I love the pollo fundido also, and the taco salad. The horchada is also refreshing!  A very well-run place with friendly, fast and accommodating service and high quality Mexican flavors. A favorite for sure!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service and great food. Best Mexican I've had in Charlotte and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best steak burrito I've ever had.  And, they're so fast!  Unbelievably good."}
{"text":"This is by far my favoite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte.  I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I was in the area visiting my family and they absolutely had nothing but amazing things to say about this place so we all decided to go for lunch. We were a big group (a group of nine) and we were able to be seated quite quickly, however we were separated in two tables. The place was packed and the servers looked a big overwhelmed, but all were friendly. The food was on point.. The steak fajitas were delicious and my husband ordered the fish tacos (the fish pieces were breaded which was kind of odd but still yummy). The chips and salsa were fresh and you can tell home made. The carne asada that my cousin ordered looked AMAZING!! They are expanding the restaurant which is totally necessary, as my family tells me the wait time can be crazy. If I lived in this city, this would be my go to Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"BEST TACOS around! I always get the car but as \"traditional\" with diced onions & cilantro and they are fantastic!! I only add some of their yummy salsa & they're perfect! Service is always fast and food is always hot & fresh! When you want tacos this is the only place to go!"}
{"text":"I have been all over this country and mexico and these were some of the best tacos ever. Free queso chips and salsa. If I lived near I would be a regular. I am still smiling and so full. A must eat at if you are in Monroe. Absolutely great."}
{"text":"I would probably give 3.5 stars but I decided to round up instead of down. The food I would give 5 stars but the service I would give 2 stars, hence the rating. Let me explain.   I'll start with the negatives so I can end on a positive note. The service was absolutely horrible!! It was not a busy night by any means, the restaurant was empty and our waitress was just slow and not attentive. We sat for about 20 minutes before she took our order. I can understand if it's busy but it wasn't. Then once bringing our food she pretty much never came by again. You go to the front to pay but she never even brought us a bill. We had to walk up and ask for it so she wrote it at the register and handed it to us. While walking to the front I noticed all the waitresses standing around talking, hmmm guess that's why she couldn't check on us. Not busy with customers just busy gossiping. Also they are authentic here and so are the employees. This is important to know because their English is not good. Thankfully my brother in law speaks Spanish so he was our interpreter when she couldn't understand what \"grilled chicken\" was.   Now for positives. If you can get past the service and language barrier the food is actually really good. For starters they give not only free chips and salsa but free queso!! The queso is amazing!! You get one free basket of chips, which are the real deal, homemade tortilla goodness. Free queso and 3 different types of free salsa, 4 if you count the free Pico de Gallo on the side. Legit amazing, fresh ingredients. Huge chunks of tomato, red onion, cilantro etc.   For my entree I went American and just ordered crunchy, beef tacos. Wanted to order something safe that I knew I liked since it was a new place. They also have the authentic tacos as well. My husband had enchiladas. We all cleared our plates so nobody was unhappy with their food.   Good prices for good portions. We spent less on dinner then we had for brunch that day . The water cups are giant as well, I think this is so the servers don't have to check on you as much lol, but at least it was plenty. In the end, I would come again but don't expect good service. The food is just that good to keep you coming back."}
{"text":"Thank you to all of the Yelp reviewers whose enthusiasm convinced me to try La Unica. Had lunch there today with my hubby. It was exactly what we have been looking for, for nearly 10 years, since moving to Charlotte from Texas. Authentic, fresh Mexican food (without the fuss).   The menu is extensive and includes a varied lunch menu for quick lunch service, as well as a full menu that has me already planning my next trip. I can't wait to try their 7 fish stew (I passed someone having a bowl of it on my way in). Today, I ordered the Tacos de Asada, because I figured the best way to know if they're legit is to try the Carne Asada... And I was NOT disappointed. The tacos were served on a double-stack of the BEST corn tortillas I've had since Texas, and were filled with the perfect amount of seasoned, chopped carne asada meat. They were served with fresh onions and cilantro over the top, as well as (get this) a whole fire-roasted jalapeño and onion. HEAVENLY. The refried beans were very good, not the typical sludge you get in other places. The Spanish rice was flavorful and moist, and made a delicious complement to the dish. I added a touch of their house-made hot salsa (chunky-style with heat!) to the top, squeezed a touch of fresh lime, rolled it up, and savored every last bite.   I was especially impressed with their seafood selections, too many to name, except to mention that every Latino I passed in the restaurant had a seafood dish and looked happy as can be. Next time, I'm gonna pull the, \"I'll have what he's having\" routine.   As someone who can't have dairy, I greatly appreciated that there were many options on the menu that weren't queso-laden, sour cream-covered globs of meat and cheese. I do wish I had seen a few more vegetarian options on the menu, which is the only improvement I can note at this time.  My next trip to La Unica will be at a time that I can enjoy a margarita, and I will be sure to report back!"}
{"text":"Another update: I've decided the food and service here are worth 4 stars, and I just have to remember to ask for my flan plain or I'll get the horrible whipped cream and maraschino cherry! The 5 salsas, pico de gallo, cheese dip and chips alone are worth the stars!!   Update: I stopped here a second time and ordered a delicious flan like I had before, but this time it was topped with whipped cream and a marachino cherry. I ordered to go, so I didn't realize this until I got home. Disgusting. I lowered my rating to 3 stars. This is not how my flan was served the first time, and I should have been asked if I wanted the whipped cream or not. The rest of the food I ordered was good, but the main reason I came back was for a flan like the flan I had the first time. The flan was ruined and I was very disappointed.   Original review: I stopped here for some takeout today. The FLAN was tasty and so was the horchata. The flan was so good I could have eaten 2 flans, even after I ate the huge, tasty chicken Burrito La Unica (that came with 2 different tasty salsas on the side). I'll be back to try some different dishes, and definitely for more of that flan and horchata."}
{"text":"I have been a customer at La unica for many years. The food is great and the staff is always friendly. Love this place !"}
{"text":"The food is great. But every time you call and place a to go order. They don't read the order back and they always forget an item. You don't get a receipt."}
{"text":"Quite delicious! I got Chicken soft tacos and Hubby got pollo con crema both were delish! Guacamole was fresh! Cheese dip was on point! We will definitely be going back! Customer service A++"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Monday night.  It was PACKED!  I would think that weeknights would be slow for some restaurants, but that was not the case here.  When my friend suggested it, it took me 5 seconds to find it on my phone and when I drove up it seemed like a small, run-of-the mill restaurant that offers Mexican fare.  My experience started as soon as I found a place to park [parking lot was a little small for the strip mall this place is associated with].  Opening the door, I was engulfed with heavenly scents of whatever was cooking in the kitchen.  Now I take it the crowd and the aromas wafting from this place just from the parking lot was a great sign.  Out wait was quite long, but it was well worth it.  The hosts did not forget about us... but I totally could see that the larger groups were getting \"priority\" since they can bring in more $$ with them.  No harm done... everyone gets to eat and the restaurant makes a killing.  The chips were offered with 2 salsas... One mild and another with a good kick to the sinuses.  Of course both were really good and you can tell, they were made fresh.  I had the enchiladas supreme.... which were very good.  I have to admit I am a sucker for enchiladas, but my friend swears by their carnitas.  They looked very good.   My meal also came with rice, shredded lettuce, 2 slices of tomatoes, and a dollop of sour cream.  Good stuff.  Overall a great place.  Can't wait to go back and try more of their offerings"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food!   This little restaurant doesn't look like much on the outside, but is nice on the inside.  It's luckily close to my home also.  Their Mexican fare is fresh and very tasty."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food. Margaritas are awesome as well. If your looking for good food  this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Not very impressed and surprised at all the good reviews. The servers and hostesses were very nice but the food we had just wasn't very good. We had quesadillas, chips and enchiladas and it was rather bland. I probably have high standards because I've eaten a lot of Mexican in other parts of the country, it's generally not very good in NC. It also took 10 minutes after we sat to get service."}
{"text":"Salsa and chips great one is spicy and another one that is very hot! Chicken fajitas were tasteless with onion only, no red or green peppers and condiments was shredded iceberg lettuce, a teaspoon of chopped tomato and sour cream. No shredded cheese! Corn tortillas were stale! Not going to rush back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is fabulous!  The chips are always on point and the salsa is super tasty!  The service is great...fast and super friendly!  The restaurant is always very orderly and super clean!  The food is delicious and it comes out to you within just a couple minutes...which is great if you have kids or if you are super hungry! :). The prices are VERY reasonable!"}
{"text":"For 8 years I have been meaning to give La Unica a try.  Well, I finally did and I am so disappointed that I waited so long!!!   I went during lunch hours on a Thursday and it was busy, but was able to get a seat right away.  I had a Carnitas Taco and a Chorizo taco and a side of rice.  Everything was fantastic!  I wonder if they make their own Chorizo because it tasted better/fresher than any store-bought Chorizo I have ever tasted.  The chips and salsa were good, but I had to mix the medium and hot to come up with something tolerable for my \"not too hot\" taste.  Prices were great ($1.95 per taco and $1.99 for the rice), service was acceptable, and the food came out quickly.  I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Lengua taco not bad, Pastor Torta decent. Taqueria El Nevado a little further out on Central is noticeably better."}
{"text":"Carnivore heaven.  Seriously.  Charlotte (and surroundings) has no shortage of Mexican places, especially to the East and South sides, but go a little further beyond the usual and out to Indian Trail if you're looking for your fix.  It's worth it.  I totally get if you want some mole at Casa de las Enchiladas, as I jones for it too.  But if you just want some tasty pork to drip flavor down the esophagus, look no further than this almost unmarked location in a strip mall.  Do not linger - signs on the wall warn you to have your entire party before being seated and not to have business meetings during lunch.  They pack them in and get them out again.  As others have mentioned, the chips are tasty and they are served with two salsa.  The chunky one is awesome.  The mild one is so-so.  If you go for the chunky, you might need something to tame the heat.  Consider yourself warned.  Everything else?  Nothing special.  Rice, beans, tortillas.  The real star here is the meat.  I don't know if they marinade it, kill it fresh or age it in a backroom somehow.  Frankly I don't even care if it's mixed with something I'd rather not see.  It is that good.  I only wish the rest of the food would match up to the meat.  Still, you can get average sides anywhere.  I don't think you can get meat this tender anyplace in the area.  Go.  Now.  And bring me some."}
{"text":"I'll second the thought that the decor isn't much, because it isn't.  But I'm not sure about the idea that they don't speak much English.  While this isn't a Taco Bell, and definitely is place more off-the-beaten path than your average Americanized Mexican eatery, they speak better English than a lot of places you might find.  Interesting because of their locale - in this section of Central, you're just as likely (if not more so) to find a place that doesn't speak any English at all - for instance, the Casa de las Enchiladas right down the block.  In any case, the food is decent, but I didn't find it all that great.  If you're at the Central Avenue location, I'd go the extra half a block and go to Casa de las Enchiladas - though you might want to brush up on your Spanish first."}
{"text":"This is honestly my favorite Mexican restaurant. Staff is always nice and friendly!! I love their chicken fajitas. They give you so much food. My fiancé has tried many things without any complaints. My favorite part is the spicy salsa! It's chunky and so flavorful. It has a massive kick to it!! Sometimes I buy some to go. The restaurant is clean. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"If you really like Mexican food, there's no better place in Charlotte than La Unica.  Driven by it for years, never paid any attention until a coworker took me to lunch.  OMG is it good.  The food is hot and fresh, staff is friendly.  Free chips with two types of salsa just for showings up...gotta love that!  It's busy because it's GOOOOOOD.  Seriously skip the chains and step up to the real deal."}
{"text":"This place is our go-to. The service is always incredible, the food has always been amazing- every visit solidifies that La Unica is the real deal here in Charlotte.   Highlights: cheesesteak burrito, tamarindo drink, chips & salsa, queso.   LOVE. THIS. PLACE."}
{"text":"Super fast service, the best Mexican food that I've ever had and I eat it a lot!  Had it for lunch one day then brought my wife back for diner the same day."}
{"text":"Steak was like jerky wish I would have just went home and cooked. Service was good. Very fast but quality of food was low. I would expect seasoning on the steak for a Mexican restaurant. The bean soup was good but from a can. Just low quality food on a budget so if that's what you are looking for this is your place ."}
{"text":"If I were just judging on food alone La Unica would easily get 5 stars. The complimentary salsas, fresh pico de gillo, chips and cheese dip are top notch! The portions are generous and the margaritas are always delicious. The issue is the service. For every 5 visits we may get 1 decent waitress who offers refills and asks how our meals are. The food is authentic and tasty but the service leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Great!!!  Love the salsa assortment and queso you get as soon as you walk in.  I have tried many things on this menu and I have never been disappointed. Only reason I didn't give it five stars is because some of the items I have grown to like such as chili relleno and poblano peppers aren't on the menu."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going here for 2 years now.  The food is always EXCELLENT and the secret is out because they are always busy.  I love the carnitas tacos and the carne asada.  The salsas are fresh and have varying degrees of heat.  Service is always excellent.  I can't say I've ever had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"The salsa and chips are the only positive I have for this place. Flies surrounded me the whole time I was trying to eat the fajitas where very chewy minus the shrimp which was decent. My waitress came by twice and never brought me my check had to walk to the counter and pay with no check. He Harrisburg location is much better. Very disappointed with this after such high reviews"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food that matches the quality of what I've grown up eating in San Diego. It's definitely different than what I grew up with but still delicious. Their fajitas are top notch. Myself and the family will continue to visit this restaurant when we are craving that Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant ever. If you want authentic Mexican meal and friendly service this is the place to go.... Love this place."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mexican restaurants in town. The employees are nice and the service is always quick (as long as it's not Sunday lol)."}
{"text":"This place has never disappointed me. My whole family and I can rarely agree on where to eat, but this place we can always agree upon. The food is authentic and amazing, and the service is great."}
{"text":"Truly the best Mexican food you will find. The food is so fresh, I usually get the taco salad and the chicken is the freshest I have ever tasted. The service is quick and everyone is very friendly. Before you even have your drink there are fresh tortilla chips on your table with 2 delicious salsas. It's a must try when in Indian Trail."}
{"text":"We decided to visit this restaurant after reading about it on Yelp. Boy, were we disappointed!   Restaurant is located in a strip mall, nothing fancy nor dressy establishment.  Parking lot is small so parking can be an issue.   We were seating fairly quickly but made to think that we had to speed walk to our table by the hostess.  She was in a hurry although no one was waiting for a table when we arrived.  The waiter came over and took our drink order.   We Ordered our food and it came out quickly.  Salsa and chips were good. Cheese dip was too runny and semi warm.   Our Waiter was very courteous and friendly which is the ONLY reason that I've given it this restaurant two stars.  The food was the biggest disappointment ever!  I ordered a combination plate with three tacos, rice and beans.  My tacos were salty and I would've been better off going through the drive thru at Taco Bell.  The rice was hard and the beans were luke warm at best.   Everyone in my party was disappointed with their food and we could not figure out what the fuss about this place was all about.  When we left, to my surprise the line was out the door for people waiting for their table.   Moreover, if you're craving a frozen margarita with salt on the rim of the glass - don't bother.  They don't have a alcohol license, so they don't serve any adult beverages.   I don't think that I will ever be back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"After a long hard run at carowinds we decided to stop here. Of the 5 times we have been here there was 1 time that the food was just not as good as the other times. We brought it up to our waitress and she said if it's like that again to let them know. They have the best salsas and selection of salsa that they bring to you. Finally since my family and I moved here we have found real salsa that has a kick to it instead of the full and bland. Every place Mexican restaurant we have been to when asked if they have anything spicier they bring back chili oil which is not how you make spicy salsa. Cecilia's is the only place we eat at in irmo, sc because her food has never disappointed us , the salsa is amazing and we will never go anywhere else unless he head up to carowinds."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. I've been coming here for around 4-5 years now, which means they're doing well. In fact, they're expanding into the building next door. Every meal comes with free chips and salsa. This is pretty standard for a Mexican place. The salsas come in two flavors: mild (which is thinner and very tomato-y and garlicky) and spicy (which is a lot chunkier and has onions and cilantro mixed in). If you ask your waiter or waitress, you can get a green salsa and a brown salsa in addition to the two you are given. The brown one is really spicy. The green one looks like guacamole and it tastes like green chiles. As far as the food goes, I'm vegetarian and I usually get one of the vegetarian dinners. Vegetarian Dinner #1 is my top pick (bean burrito, cheese enchilada, and rice). The rice and beans are also very good, but the rice isn't exactly exploding with flavor. Another thing I like about this place is the consistency. If you like something, it will always be that good every time you come back. But, above all else, is the great service. If you go there enough, they pick up on it and know you by name (or at least by face) and they will come over and say hi. Best Mexican Place I've ever been to!"}
{"text":"The plates come sizzling right to your table filled with authentic Mexican food all at a great price. Every meal comes with chips and four or five different types of dip. The staff is great and the only down side is that when they are busy you might have to wait for a table but that's only because the food is so good everyone wants to eat there. If you love Mexican food you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Why on earth does this place have such high ratings?! We haven't had Mexican food this bland and hopelessly boring in years...maybe not ever. Honestly, I think this may have been the blandest Mexican food we've ever had and we've been eating Mexican food regularly all over the country for well over 20 years. Nothing tasted as it should; the mole sauce was bland, the chorizo was bland, the steak tacos were bland. The salsa and guacamole were good enough, but that was not enough to save the experience for us. We were literally dousing our food in lime juice and hot sauce and that was still not enough to cover the fact that everything tasted the same and was essentially tasteless (like hospital food or some other institutional slop). While discussing how/why this place had such high markings online we looked around and saw it packed to the brim (on a Sunday night) but not a single diner was of Latin origin. This place is for gringos, period. For gringos who don't know what good Mexican food should taste like. Also, the service was grim. Our waitress never brought enough utensils for us, never brought us our waters, only brought one to-go container when we asked for two. We haven't had service that poor in a while...honestly the whole experience was totally disappointing. Don't go here...you can find way better Mexican food in the Charlotte area. And it wasn't even that cheap - these are not taqueria prices they're charging. Oh and they don't have alcohol either. You cannot even use a strong margarita to convince yourself that the food here is worth eating."}
{"text":"nothing could go wrong in this place. if u dislike it or complain u have issues. oh and i'm hispanic so you're smoking crack if u think this is \"flavorless mexican\" take your ass to sabor white people food"}
{"text":"I grew up in Arizona and have lived in Mexico, so I grew up on real deal Mexican food. That being said, Taqueria La Unica is where I go for the food I grew up on, my \"soul food\" if you will. Their \"authentic\" tacos are just like the El Chino taco stand I used to love on the beach in Puerto Peñasco. They have 5 or 6 different kinds at La Unica. Everything I've ever had is A++. When I take my Dad he gets what I call \"Gringo-Mex\" dishes like the \"Speedy Gonzales\" or one of their Chimichangas. But literally EVERYTHING is good. I would especially recommend the Carnitas dinner and the Ceviche. They do both of these dishes as well as anybody. Breakfast is KILLER, try a burrito. My wife loves their shrimp plates and fajitas. My little girl (7yo) LOVES the enchiladas. The prices are more than reasonable. If you like avocado, make sure you ask for some of their avocado salsa when they bring out the mild and hot with the chips. If I ever have to eat Mexican food anywhere else in Charlotte-Metro, it never measures up to La Unica. You might have to wait to be seated, but they are fast and it's SO worth it!"}
{"text":"Chicken Soup for the Soul!  The best chicken tortilla soup in NC-comes with 2 cheese quesadillas for the low low price of $6.95.   Tons of high quality food for average to low prices. My sons likes the burritos, my husband the soft tacos.   Serves a big basket of chips and two different types of salsa. You can ask for third kind-green which is very hot but is good. Not included gratis but, delicious is that big dipping bowl of queso."}
{"text":"Hands down, the BEST Mexican food in Charlotte. If you go to this place and order a normal Tex-Mex entree you a SERIOUSLY missing out. Order the traditional tacos, carne asada, carnitas, arroz con pollo, sopa de pollo, etc. You will NOT be disappointed.   The staff is awesome. They always greet me upon entering and the manager always makes time to come visit my table and say hi to my son (he's 2 and this is his favorite restaurant).  It is ALWAYS packed. But absolutely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Food was bad, meat is of the lowest quality it tasted really really really bad. Very greasy, bad server that kept forgetting what I ordered, and I even got sick after visiting this establishment.   I'm Mexican, and although the food looks authentic is food I'm wary about their health and sanitation practices."}
{"text":"Hole in the Wall Taco Shop with amazing salsas.  Fresh, complimentary, and accompanied by delicious chips, are the best precursor to the delicious authentic offering of this little shop. Cheap, delicious, great service and super fast, awesome spot that we keep coming back to over and over."}
{"text":"My family and I tend to be very picky about their tastes, but this place hits the spot for everyone. Do you have bland tastes? Pollo Fundido Dinner is perfect. It's not overly spicy, and just has chicken, sour cream, and cheese! Like seafood, they have that too! This place is super delicious and the staff are super awesome. If you're hungry, here is a perfect place to go."}
{"text":"A place with a decent torta, finally!  Another exciting feature: burrito vegetarian. And the quesadilla de hongos was muy tasty. Have yet to try the Rancheros or the Chilaquiles, as I keep coming here for sammiches. The squirt-bottle salsa thing is more funny than it is cool... but I was down, and dug on both the verde and the enjocoque (orange stuff, creamy-ish with a toasted nut aftertaste.... you know what I'm sprayin).   I guess since they emphasize their torta selection, I was expecting that they would be more awesome. Mine (huevos con queso et all) was squishy and messy, and a little bland, but had quite a pile of jalapenos on it and is, thus far, the best torta I've had in Charlotte.  Safe vegetarian bet with a somewhat authentic flavor. Will be back for more tortas (especially at the uber-reasonable price of $5!!)!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the food here. The prices on the food is super affordable and the service is also in a timely manner. When I'm craving Mexican food, this is definitely one of the spot."}
{"text":"the free dips etc. are a gift to make up for the poor service you are about to receive..  Every Time we've been here we have had horrible customer service and rude waitresses.  M husband and I decided tonight  NEVER again!   as soon as we gave our drink order we were forced to  \"Go ahead and order\" even though we hadn't even look at the menu yet!   the waitress kept cutting me off and talking over as I was trying to answer her question  (as if she was trying to guess what my response was).  My food was wrong and I had to \"reorder\"... we had to pay for both! ..but before this I was told I couldn't have my food because the kitchen was already closed down.. I eventually did get my food after she 'spoke with the owner', it was just okay.  a group of guys came in and the waitress took their order, but no food was ever given to them, they were told the kitchen was closed even though they were allowed to come inside and be seated! ..?  Awful Customer Service!"}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly good! I usually enjoy a nicer atmosphere, but for the amazing flavors of their food, it was worth it. They are the only place to have chilaquiles in Charlotte. I tried it in Mexico and have been craving it ever since. La Unica's was really good. Thank you guys! The shrimp quesadilla's are really good too! It is nice to practice my Spanish, and the servers are always happy to speak it right back. They are so nice. Muchos gracias!"}
{"text":"I took the family there for lunch after church this past Sunday.  The place was pretty busy and evidently as popular as the reviews here suggest.   The service was great, prices were reasonable, and the food was fresh and delicious -- their hard taco shells are awesome! Their tea is fresh brewed and delicious!  I am not sure about it being the very best Mexican I have ever had, but I have to admit it was above average. I will definitely go there again with the family."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican joint in town. The food and service is consistently good. The sauces seem to have gotten spicier over time, or so it seems!  Definitely try the green sauce- it's delicious and super spicy at the same time. The wait can seem long at times but its usually no longer than 15 minutes."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place! I have never had anything there that was anything less than delicious. Every time I come home from college, this is one of the first places I go to eat. I once brought friends home with me, and they wanted to eat here again. And again. And again. And bring it to Tampa.  Not only is the food incredible and delicious, but the prices are KILLER. For the amount of food you get, this is the best bang for your buck around.  The best part of this place is that the staff is just as awesome as the food. My family can be a bit...overwhelming, and they've never been anything but kind and welcoming to us.  I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some awesome Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Mexican food!! Very unassuming restaurant in a little strip mall  on Old Monroe Rd. You must find this place & give it a try next time you're in the Indian Trail area. The chorizo quesadilla was top notch. Hell, anything chorizo gets my vote! If there is a downside, it's that there is no alcohol served. I can live with that. Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Taqueria La Unica is going from a 4 star to a 5 star for this guy! This place is hands down the best Mexican food in the Charlotte Metro area for the money!!! I've been back several times and it just keeps getting better. On my last visit, I had the chicken chimichanga w/ a side of re-fried beans and rice. I also ordered a shredded beef soft taco ($1.85) too. It's so simple yet has fantastic flavors. Literally its' shredded beef, cilantro & diced onions on a floor tortilla.  Should have gotten a few more of those. Always a great experience and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty great.  Really good (but not excellent) food and reasonable prices.  They have an odd policy noted on their menu that only the first bowl of chips are free.  Pretty much every other Mexican place has unlimited chips, so that is pretty weird.  I still give it 4 stars since it is close to home and good, cheap Mexican places around here are really hard to come by. I have tried many others around and this is the best by far."}
{"text":"I grew up with Mexican food, with a father who grew up in Southern California.  While I'm no snob, I'm sick of the faux-mexican restaurants in this area and what they pass off. Well, La Unica is a breath of fresh air!  My 2nd favorite mexican restaurant, and IMHO the 2nd most authentic in the Charlotte area I've tried.  Anything on the menu is good, the servers are friendly and attentive, and the prices are fair. The one complaint I would have is crowd control.  They're almost always busy, you almost always have to wait, and the entrance is a mash of people waiting, leaving and paying - such that sometimes you can't catch their eye to get your name on the list because they just don't know if you're coming or going. But it's worth the wait to have real mexican!"}
{"text":"The best mexican food we've ever tasted!!  Everything is amazing.  So much flavor and fresh"}
{"text":"Love the salsa and tacos. Not your typical tex mex tacos... So much better."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food in a very unexpected location.  The restaurant is a bit cramped and always busy.  I've never had a bad dinner here and my GF and I eat here once a month for over a  year now.  The food is always quick and very tasty.  Skip the hot salsa for the chips....too overpowering.  This place is like Azteca minus all the cheesy props and Mariachi band.  The staff is always friendly and will go out of their way to make you happy if the dish you ordered isn't exactly what you thought it would be.  This place is our \"old reliable\" when we can't decide where to eat out....we default here.  Yum."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE Mexican restaurant . The food usually comes very fast and is delicious. The salsa is also Great!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place, I had heard so much about this place in the last couple of weeks having relocated here from California I know a thing or two about good tacos I was a bit reluctant to believe the this place was as good as people said. We went there with family tonight and service was friendly,  place looks clean, tacos were the bomb! Cecilia took care of our table she was very efficient,  friendly and professional. I do not know how other Mexican places measure up to this one, I think from now on this will be my place to go for tacos. I would more than likely recommend this place to my friends family and you. Thank you for dinner tonight."}
{"text":"Everything is authentic from the decoration to the patrons, servers, music and most importantly the food"}
{"text":"Yummy! But two important things to note: no alcohol, and they do not accept american express."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to stop for quick and delicious Mexican food. Start your meal with complimentary queso dip and a selection of 5 different salsa's. Then choose a meal from their specials or full menu. The taco loco is my go to lunch favorite for under $5. Don't let the price fool you, it's very filling."}
{"text":"Menudo needed salt or spices or maybe oregano?    The tacos (lengua and barbacoa) were delicious classics and the salsas were perfection. Will become a regular. New to Charlotte and this restaurant is a top choice for Mexican food here."}
{"text":"My favorite local restaurant. Food is consistently good. We eat here multiple times each week. Gotta try it!"}
{"text":"La Unica continues to be one of my favorite places to eat.  With the expansion, the wait (at times) has become very reasonable, especially for such a popular place.  Service continues to be top notch and the food always good!"}
{"text":"Always consistently good food! The salsas are awesome, the burritos and tacos are yummy. Expect to wait during normal dinner and lunch times because this place is always packed! My favorite Mexican restaurant, and I have no reason to go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Bringing it down another notch.  I'm sorry folks.  I know people love this place but I do not get why.  I ordered the veggie fajitas yesterday and literally only sizzling onions came out.  I asked the waitress why there were only onions and she said because they only have peppers, onions, tomatoes and mushrooms in their veggie fajitas.  So, I asked why it said on the menu \"and other mixed veggies\" and she said she didn't know but she could add some more peppers to the fajitas if that would help. I asked for corn tortillas but got flour.  We asked for lemons for our water, they only do limes and forgot to bring them.  I asked if I can substitute other beans (ie black or charro) for the refried and she said no...The menu states no substitutions can be made to menu items.  Seriously?    Our waitress had a sourpuss look on the face the entire time as did others that approached our table.  We asked for more chips and salsa and they forgot to bring them.    Overall, a horrible experience.  I was willing to try them again because they seem to be the \"hit\" but they do not cut it for me. My original thought remains:  too big for your britches La Unica.  Get over yourself!!!!"}
{"text":"Hoofed out to Monroe on a desperate quest to find good Mexican food.  The owner at Azteka not only knows me by name but by order.  When I call in my order for pick-up, he finishes my sentences....not sure if that is an honor or embarrassing...but all that to say, I felt like it was time to venture out to another spot for Mexican this past weekend and Monroe isn't too far so decided to give Taqueria a shot since the reviews were so amazing.  They definitely get an \"a\" for authenticity.  I think the majority of people eating there were Mexican and most of the staff didn't seem to speak English so I would say it was pretty close to the \"real\" deal.  Like others stated, we received the buffet of salsas and cheese dip upon arrival---definitely unnecessary because I only liked one of the salsa's but I think the gesture was nice.  The menu was pretty standard.  I ordered three chicken tacos a la carte and the mr. ordered a burrito.  I swear we just got finished saying the \"o\" in burrito and our food was on the table.  I have NEVER seen such a quick turnaround...not even for Mexican food.  I can't say I think that is a good thing...it is always a little curious to me how they pull that off and how fresh everything really could be.  I don't think I am exaggerating when I say we must have only waited about 30 seconds before our meals were served.  Regardless, everything did seem pretty fresh and authentic.  My tacos were on corn tortillas and they were pretty much falling apart so that was no bueno but the flavor was decent.  The chicken was a little dry but not terrible.  The burrito was smothered in cheese so it didn't taste bad, but the beef itself was not very flavorful.  We had to order our sides separately which I thought was annoying so we ordered the rice and beans and both were pretty standard.   All in all it was just okay..If this is the most authentic Mexican in the charlotte area then I guess I am okay with just semi-authentic because I didn't think it was that great.  The service beyond their fast-food speed was a little brutal.  Our waitress really never came by again..not sure where she disappeared to...maybe she was taking a siesta.  My opinion....don't hoof out to Monroe to visit this restaurant...if you are in the area, heading to Myrtle or south in general then by all means, go.  Otherwise, Charlotte has plenty of great options.    ** Another tip---location is a little sketchy so if you have your carry permit...carry!"}
{"text":"We  La Unica! We are always seated quickly, even if during peak times. And being greeted warmly by Victor is always a plus. Hubby and I always stick to our old-time favorites, burrito mexicano. It always amazes me how quickly your food arrives and piping hot. When really hungry, we add an extra burrito and we leave stuffed. Our older son had a crazy burrito which used to be my \"usual\". The little guy ordered off the kids' menu...a chicken burrito, perfect for a smaller appetite."}
{"text":"Just moved to Monroe and was looking for someplace to eat so I opened up yelp and found this place. Boy am I glad I did. The food and service were both awesome. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The place was dirty, service was poor, and the fajitas were made with a fajita mix, that I think came from a store. Overall very disappointed."}
{"text":"THE absolute BEST home made chicken soup in the history of chicken or soup!"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh & delicious. Love the fresh salsas & friendly staff. My family's favorite Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food here. Service is not always up to par but food is always excellent.  Went to Indian Trail location and will not go back."}
{"text":"Best Mexican I've found around the Charlotte area.  The food is always consistent and the salsa will warm you up."}
{"text":"Me and my family's absolute top pick for Mexican in the area. The authentic tacos (pork in particular) can't be beat, and queso is great. They give you tons of chips in to go orders, with hot salsa. Great for take out, eating in is crowded."}
{"text":"This is by far the most bland, tasteless Mexican food I have ever eaten in my life. The people that eat here have clearly never experienced authentic Mexican food. I would only go back if I was starving to death and this was the only food available."}
{"text":"I was told this was a good a place for tacos in the area, but I was very disappointed  since a stepped in the front door. The entire place was dirty, service was poor and food was tasteless. the only good thing they have is their hot salsas. overall Gross!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and service. Great value. You can't go wrong. Parking lot is best suited for monster trucks but who cares! I go here for lunch every trip to Monroe!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Indian Trail Mexican restaurant. It is so good, so fast, so authentic. We love all the servers. You cannot beat the price. The carnitas are to die for."}
{"text":"Coming from the west coast I knew good Mexican would be hard to find. I don't know what the place is doing so far east and south but it was fantastic. Fajita de pollo y enchiladas were amazing and authentic, not weird chain Mexican food crap. The service was amazing and they put up with us during World Cup. 5 Stars, going back this week before we leave town."}
{"text":"Food is good but the 3 star is for the service.  I ordered 4 tacos of two different kinds but the waitress only took down 2. and I wanted to order more but they never looked at my direction again. So I paid and left."}
{"text":"great place to go for your taco fix! clean and tasty!"}
{"text":"Love the fact that they give you tons different salsas and some queso - for free! There is an avocado-based sauce (I think) that they give you that is really really good. Almost like a thin, spicy guacamole. Good portions for not that much money!"}
{"text":"My wife and our daughter have been here many times and every time we are amazed by how nice the people are, how quickly we get our food and how fantastic that food is. They have TE best tacos I have ever eaten. It's not really worth making them at home once you've had their tacos. There may be a lot of people there but the change over is quick and you never have to wait more than a few minutes. They do a great job and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Mexican food with a very local feel. No booze which is a negative since I need me my margarita!"}
{"text":"Moving from Los Angeles  it was hard to find decent let alone good Mexican food. La Unica is the best we've found. The chips and salsa are good which is the first sign they know what they're doing."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Great salsa - spicy and mild. Awesome tacos! Loved the chicken but ground beef were awesome.  Good flautas!   Good rice and beans!"}
{"text":"The absolute best Mexican food! No other la uni a like it. Can't find a better horchata. Complimentary queso and delicious salsa."}
{"text":"Yay!  I finally found a good authentic Mexican restaurant in the Charlotte area!    I had a craving for Mexican and tried this place out with my husband the other night.  The service was fast and the food was great.  I ordered steak tacos and got a side of fried beans and rice... Everything was very good!  The tacos came with onions and lettuce so next time I'm going to make sure to ask for cheese and tomatoes.  If you're looking for really good authentic Mexican food, put on your finest t-shirt and sweatpants and head over here!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent. On way home from beach decided to yelp and the reviews got us there. If you love Mexican this will absolutely be one of the best you've ever had!  Wish there was one close to my home!!!"}
