{"text":"I love shisha but i don't indulge as often as i used to.  These places are becoming more and more rare in Montreal. The atmosphere is very Middle-Eastern-ish but nobody bothers anybody here.  It's over 90% male here (just putting it out there), the ventialation system is not really adequate so most newcomers tend to leave after an hour.  The selection of tobacco flavors is small, but the prices are good ($15 for a shisha, with a mint tea). There are tv's playing but it's really mostly a place to relax and enjoy."}
{"text":"I love shisha, and this place has reasonably priced shisha. 12$ for basically 4-6 coals. You know that means....shihsa lovers can smoke for HOURS. Not expensive at all and comes in many exotic and modern flavors like jasmine (which is always out of stock when I come but maybe next time!!) 5 alive, cinnamon etc. Service is decent and I always order the mint green tea  which comes in a huge mug while smoking my shisha."}
{"text":"Very good shisha and food. Not enough room for big groups unless you're a VIP there. Customer service wasn't good at all."}
