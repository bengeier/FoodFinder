{"text":"Ordered dinner from here for the first time a couple of weeks ago. We got the cantonese lo mein, good eat combination fried rice, beef w/ mixed chinese veg, and kung pao chicken. Total came to about $36 after tax. The girl at the cash was super friendly. Told me that there would be a 30 min wait since it was the dinner rush hour and that she would call me when it was ready - which was helpful. Unfortunately, that's as far as I can go re: the good stuff....I want to say that I liked the food, but I can't. It just wasn't very good. Everything was bland and just not very appetizing; we ended up just picking at it..."}
{"text":"Wings here are great for up north. Get the honey garlic (sauce on the side), and the spicy wings, bomb!"}
{"text":"Don't even waste your money. The food was gross. Everything was previously frozen and had a weird taste. The interior of the restaurant was dirty and old. Also the woman working was rude af. I'll never recommend anyone back to that place."}
{"text":"Chicken wings are the best. The cashier is also very good looking."}
