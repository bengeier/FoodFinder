{"text":"I have to be craving a Coke pretty bad to venture into this parking freak show. You can see the intensity, bordering on rage, as people jockey for position in their parking lot. The store itself is fine, as long as you decide not to give up and keep circling, circling, circling......."}
{"text":"Well I hate to bash or to give a bad rating to a convenient store because its all about speed and getting customers in and out without any hinderance or long waiting periods... But i just got 2 hotdogs and a hashbrown to go. And once i got
home 15 mins later and ready to eat my food. I didnt even want to take a bite of my hotdogs. They were nasty looking. Over cooked or had been sitting on the cooker for far too long to be served to a paying customer. I wouldnt even mi d if they were a little over cooked. But i attempted to eat them anyway because i was hungry. And it was hard just trying to pierce through the over cooked hotdogs! It was like trying to chew rubber! Sure i was in and with good timing but id rather wait an additional few minutes for fresh or atleast edible food. Sorry that i woke the cook up who really didnt display any interaction with me as i asked if she needed to see my reciept. Just seemed miserable. Hopefully this was a onetime occurance?  Order #1044....6:20am....After posting this review i called the store and talked to the manager Janet. She was very kind, hospitable and professional. She is the reason why i will continue to do business with getgo. Hence the reason I changed my rating from 2 stars to 4. Thank you Janet."}
{"text":"Easily the worst get go I've been to. Lazy and often ambivalent help struggle to make even the simplest of sandwiches properly. Seriously don't understand how any of them keep their jobs. Stick to the nightmare of getting gas in the tiny lot and avoid the nightmare of getting food."}
{"text":"I'm sure being a get go employee is not what one aspires to be in their youth, but it CAN'T be that bad. Since I frequent this location often, ( twice a day on average) I'm aware of the late night rush for fast sandwiches and snacks. And since I work night shifts, I see what a disaster it can be. But the employees....Where do I even start? I've always written off their rudeness and complete lack of common courtesy as just them hating their jobs, but recently I've been so utterly appalled by their behavior I just have to say something because its just not right.  Two weeks ago my car key snapped off in my trunk. I had my spare, but the remote entry battery was dead. Of course, my cel phone was locked in my car. I went inside to try to call AAA. \" Do you have a phone a could use?\" I asked the man. Silence. \" excuse me could I use your phone? I asked 3 times before I was even acknowledged and after about 4 minutes of back and fourth between employees it was decided I was allowed to use it. The cashier tossed the receiver I guess in my direction and, without ever even looking at me \" what's the number\" ? The receiver to my ear, I could hear he was just pounding away, typing in random numbers. He did this about four more times and then claimed it wasn't working because I didn't know the number. I handed him the triple A card so he could read it off that, but he just looked at it, said \" that's what I just called \" and that was it. Ok. Thanks for the help. A stranger let me use his cel phone and took 45 seconds.  Two days later, again exhausted after the night shift, I waited to be checked out by any one of the 4 employees hangin out at the deli area. After minutes of debating over which cashier was going to ring me up, a tall girl w long, straight hair came meandering over with a coffee cup suctioned to her chin. It stayed there the whole time. You know, like what a child does? A few times she adjusted it, making disgusting noises and the whole time touching her mouth, face and hair. She rolled her eyes and pounded away on the screen with her nails that had yellow plastic bows on them when I asked her to scan my advantage card. Oh I'm sorry, perhaps it would be easier to ask for it if you didn't have a cup stuck to your face. She also never once said a word to or even looked at me. Until I said have a good weekend to which she replied under her breathe \" ummmmhmmmm ok\". Nice. But the most disgusting display came the next night. A deaf couple was ordering sandwiches, and the red haired cashier, a short, heavy set deli woman, and the tall man who I inconvenienced by asking him to type 7 numbers into the phone, were making fun of them. \" how am I gonna wait on them when they can't hear nuthin?\" Waving her hands in an attempt to imitate sign language and speaking \" like a deaf person\". Laughing and poking fun while I waited for a cashier and they patiently waited to order. The deaf couple smiled the whole time, completely aware of what was going on, and trying to be the bigger people. I give them credit because I would have snapped. The short woman pointed to the cashier and literally screamed at the \" YOU'All NEED TO PAY OVER THERE\" her voice booming through the store. The red haired cashier,as she was ringing me up, heard it and burst into laughter. When the couple turned around, the woman rolled her eyes and her boyfriend put his arm around her and mouthed \" it's ok, don't worry about it\" in his \" deaf guy voice\" ( NOT my words). I'm aware that this location is about convenience , but there has to be better people out there. Management needs to really step in at this point because its simply out of control. I can handle people being rude to me on a daily basis, but I hate to see others, who can't even hear what they're saying, be treated like that! It was awful and every trip there becomes more uncomfortable. Come on, get go. Step it up. New employees, a new training program, something! This is not right!"}
{"text":"I'm happy to have this Get Go near where I live. Because we buy our groceries at Market District we end up saving a lot on gas here. On our first visit we paid about a dollar a gallon because we accumulated savings without knowing it. What a great deal. 

It's nice to have an automated fast food ordering system. First you punch-in everything you want into the computer, it prints out a receipt, you pay for it at the registers, and they have it ready. Today I tried their 'build-your-own-burger' for $3.99.There's a lot of options to put into your burger. I prefer these to Five Guys. 

Almost every visit, I pick up a DVD from the RedBox. Such a convenient little store!

One major downside is that you can't get cashback on your debit card."}
{"text":"Pros: To be here you actually have be alive... and being alive is a good thing.

Cons: 
1. I think it all starts with the spatial reasoning test you need to pass in order to either find a parking spot or place to get gas. I'd say the Mensa committee would save a lot on test costs if  they just had candidates show up here and tell them to try to find the best way to find their parking spot. 
Then it all deteriorates rapidly upon going inside. 
2. Depending on the time of day (read: after midnight) you run into some real characters... and by characters I mean drunken morons. Places like this GetGo are precisely the reason why this area of Pittsburgh needs more after-hours fast-food dining options - to avoid having to stand next to drunken morons.
3. The service absolutely STINKS! I went here after a Penguins game to pick up some food. HUGE mistake. I ordered, paid a remarkably unfriendly cashier, and proceeded to wait. And wait... And wait. And at some point I realized I solved the Hodge conjecture so I just left without my food to claim my prize. Actually, I didn't solve the Hodge conjecture, but I did leave without my food because I waited 20 minutes and had enough.

Avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"I bought a cheese stuffed pretzel yesterday. I had a mouthful of raw dough, not what you want to eat ever. The managers should do some sort of quality control when it comes to food sitting under a heat lamp. The outside of the pretzel was done but not the inside."}
{"text":"There is no better deal for gas in town -Fuel Perks baby! Giant Eagle has this cornered.  Simply use your Giant Eagle card when grocery shopping and rack up the gas discounts!  Buying holiday gift cards helped my gas costs go down significantly in December.  This location though...well it's not easy.  Getting in the lot takes effort because there are 2 entrances/exits and you have to time the lights and determine the busy lot to see where to go and how to enter.  Basically, it's a cluster.  I seriously think people go full on grocery shopping and fine dining here.  Neither are acceptable.  Gas should be the focus its Get Go."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but this GetGo is just a nightmare to get in and out of. I don't understand why it was the built this way- it's always absolutely crazy busy and having to turn in or out onto Baum takes forever. A place this well equipped (Redbox, Fuel Perks, made-to-order food inside, etc) with such high customer turnover should never have been built here. I go here for the Fuel Perks, but I always snarl every time I have to stop in."}
{"text":"I don't think there's ever a dull moment at this gas station. It's perfect if you need you to get gas, because there aren't that many gas stations in or around Oakland. However, I can't think of any other gas station that is a pain to get in and out of especially during rush hour. It's always congested so be prepared for that. 

Also, the convenience store has a lot to offer especially if you don't want to make the trip to Market District down the street."}
{"text":"So I came into this get go just to get a smoothie. I ordered (super berry 20oz with yogurt) I ordered a 16oz version as well. When the employee with the large frow made the second smoothie I noticed that they were in the same sized cup. (There's a dollar different with sizes). So I told the large frow guy that he made the same sizes he was instantly ignorant with me. I asked if I could get the proper size cup and he said sorry it's a corporate thing (in a very rude manner). I confronted the manager and he reluctantly made the proper sized smoothie. It tastes horrible. I think I would hate to know what he might have done to it. All in all I am a regular customer, as I work at the pepboys down the street and am now burdened that I may never go to get go again."}
{"text":"I've been going to this GetGo for several years now and it's always hit-or-miss when ordering food.  The wait is usually decently long, but not completely absurd.  It'll seem much longer because the staff behind the counter will just be very casually going about their work like they're making a sandwich at home, chatting non-stop with each other.  Hey, I totally understand having a chill work environment.  But when business picks up, you match the pace then relax when the line is gone.  The food itself is usually okay but not great.  They could stand to get some better bread for their sandwiches."}
{"text":"GetGo in general is fine. I have to agree with everyone that this location is not good. It's a busy location so is packed all the time...but just the parking lot. The store does not seem as busy as I'd expect. The store is defintiely not busy enough to warrant the incredibly long time it takes for MTO food. They usually mess up at least something with the food but since we get it to go and eat it at home or somewhere else, it's too late to do anything about it. 

Checking out is okay, but they never seem to have enough cashiers. The store is clean and things are stocked so that's all right. It's better than nothing, but I really recommend other GetGo stores over this one."}
{"text":"They have beer now!!This place is a big improvement from the chintzy place that previously inhabited the space. This was launched as giant eagles \"get-go\" , the M.T.O. Super gas station of the future. The place is pretty nice, it's clean, the staff is friendly , and it is always well stocked. I'm not a big fan of mto style places, it's kinda garbage food to begin with, but people go crazy for it, so now they have a place in the heart of the city to get their fix. I've gotten some sandwiches and what not, late at night, possibly under the influence of beer, but not driving of course, and at that time, and place, this food hits most of the spots, if that's your thing, here's your spot. They did have some ridiculous sandwiches the sandwich of the month such as the general which was eggrolls and general tsos chicken on top of something else, I don't now and some other crazy combinations like a Thanksgiving themed one called the Pilgrim , you get the picture. Gross. They do have free air for vehicle tires, BONUS!!!!!"}
{"text":"Was there late this morning. There is a guy Jason in the kitchen area that is ignorant, rude, and just plain out disgraceful. The way he talk to the customer in front of us and the way he talks to the employees is just astonishing. When I asked who his boss is, cause I was not happy with the way he was. He told me \"to leave his store. He is in charge and to get out\". I said I asked you for your bosses name. He screamed get out now. Never again will I step foot in this location. GetGo needs to rethink what they stand for. Customer service is horrible in this store and I will be filling a complaint with the higher ups. Beware and take your business elsewhere if he is allowed to do this stuff to people. Has anyone else dealt with him?"}
{"text":"I am normally scared to get gas here because it's always so busy and the parking lot is a total disaster. Getting in and out of this parking lot can be a nightmare. Don't even think about trying to make a left onto Baum or Morewood, and if you want to make a right, remember your defensive driving skills because few people who frequent this GeGo know how to drive.

That being said, I do stop by from time to time to grab a Redbox, and I still get gas here often (because I like the fuel perks)."}
{"text":"This place is awful.  I've gotten the made to order food twice and I will never order it again.  The kitchen always appears dirty, food and receipts everywhere.  Poor hand-washing, glove using practices.  I've seen employees laying their heads on the counters next to the steam tables.

Coffee area is always a mess.  Often out of lids, even when it's past rush hour.  There's been multiple times that the vanilla creamer is MIA for days, but SEVEN open irish creamers will occupy the cold well.

Employees never remind you to use your advantage card.  They are often apathetic and distracted.  One time I bought a coffee and paid with a $10.  The kid gave me $23 back in change (I didn't notice till after I left)  I've been overcharged with refusal to present me with a receipt or fix the problem.

As a former GetGo manager I am aware of lots of problems within the company, BUT the job isn't that bad.  It pays well over what you would expect (or at least, used to) and comes with benefits and vacation days, even for part-time.  I feel like every time I come here I face the worst customer service of anywhere I've ever been.

It is no longer a convenience store when the employees making shopping there an inconvenience."}
{"text":"This GetGo is always hopping, and I assume it's from customers using their Fuel Perks to their advantage.  The place is clean and it feels safe, but often it is so crowded there is a wait to pump gas.  The parking lot is small, so it's not that easy to maneuver around."}
{"text":"I agree with Tom; If there was a Sheetz across the street, that's where I'd be.

GetGo is a very close second though. I like that if I only spend $50 in groceries that I am getting 20 cents a gallon off. 

I come here often because I work close and the wifi cafe area is very convenient. During lunch it is crowded. And the MTO food can be slow and hit or miss. But the convenience is so great. I love spending lunch there while I work on my computer in front of the huge windows while people watching."}
{"text":"this get go is close but is always soooo crowded. i shop at giant eagle so of course i use the fuel perks for my trucks diesel addiction.
anything helps when its 4.23 a gallon. always a big line inside but it moves fast .they also have a red box outside which is convenient.

overall a nice store but still it is no sheetz!"}
{"text":"Living within the city limits of Pittsburgh you're selection of grab and go is very limited.  Limited as in Giant Eagle's GetGo is about it.  Unless you like to go to a CoGos....yeah, didn't think you did either.  As others have said, I'd rather prefer a Sheetz (damn you Sheetz, move into the city already, Ross Township area doesn't count).

Now, onto this one.  I recently discovered this location is open 24 hours (bonus).  I only discovered this because I needed to get air in my one tire and was close and during a stroke of luck, I pulled in here.  Before that stop I was at this location multiple times, even before the remodel/rebuild.  I do have to say that since they redid this place, it is nice in a few ways, and horrible in a few others.

The nice part is that the inside is bigger and has a wide selection of snacks/drinks to choose from.  Also there is a nice sitting area to enjoy your food made there with free WiFi.  

The horrible aspect is that it is on a busy street with congestion getting in and out of there.  Parking is almost non existent.  And it's ALWAYS congested."}
{"text":"As far as GetGos go, this is one of my least favorite.  It's just too busy and the parking lot and pumps area is just too small.  I understand that they were crunched for space, but maybe a different location would have been better.

Staff in here is not friendly or helpful... Often times, when they are busy, the staff (although abundant) can be seen conversing with one another and not doing much pertaining to their jobs.

Gift Cards very seldom seem restocked here too... So chances are, some popular ones will remain empty.

There is some hope here if the service improves."}
{"text":"ooh i miss my \"Sheetz Run\", but this works when I'm hungry and in a rush. (& its only a 5 minute walk away) Although I've only eaten here twice, the cheesesteak was okay for being made to order at a gas station. there is also wi-fi and a nice eating area inside.. not to mention the redbox outside. they usually offer good deals on drinks (i often see a 2/$2 sign on multiple drinks)"}
{"text":"I have to agree with other reviewers--this place is a PITA to get in and out of, including by foot or bike. Given that I don't own a car anymore, I wasn't even aware that this place existed until a couple of months ago.  However, this place has one thing and one thing only that attracts me: A Redbox.  As far as I know, this is the closest Redbox to my apt., and thus, a convenient stop if I have a friend over for a movie, but I didn't prepare by ordering something from the library ahead of time.  One time, I also bought ice cream, but I don't recall having any problems checking out.  I've never ordered MTO food here, since there are approximately a thousand better places to get quick, cheap food in the neighborhood (also, being from DE, I have high standards for MTO convenience food thanks to Wawa.  Don't even ask me about Sheetz, since I haven't tried theirs yet).  Regardless of how you're accessing this place, I implore you to be careful--it's just as easy to get run over here as a pedestrian as it is to get slammed into in your car, due to the poor design. 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"The employees need to be trained in customer service. 
This location seems to be perpetually under staffed. 
Why would there only be one person working the MTO line during a weekday at noon?! That's lunch time, when everyone is trying to grab a quick and crappy bite, but we get stuck in a line of at least 6 orders deep with ONE person working it. 
Then you head to the cashier, where hopefully there is two, but one is busy flirting or yelling/laughing with their co-workers rather than focusing on their customer. 
I won't even get into how awful it is to actually purchase gas here. 
You must be fully insured to enter it, because accidents are almost inevitable."}
{"text":"This place definitely has a great snack selection and the main area is cleaner than what some reviews make it out to be. However, I ordered chicken fingers and from the \"kitchen,\" which took about 25 minutes and are about as gas station as you could get. Unfortunately, there are also a few distinct people that hang around outside at night (that they don't seem to care about), but this might also be a negative externality from the \"gentlemen's club\" next door."}
{"text":"If you like Tetris then you will LOVE this GetGo. Seriously, it is like a strategic game every time I try to pull into this parking lot. 

There is unfortunately not enough space for the amount of traffic this location gets. This location is like any other GetGo with the normal pumps, but the store area is a mini Market District with some made to order items if you're on the go.

Overall this GetGo is in a great location, but I wish there was a solution to help with the high volume of traffic it receives, which ultimately leads to my rating."}
{"text":"After overhauling the old nightmare of a GetGo, this location has improved dramatically...but ti's still just a GetGo.

The inside of the store is nice and big. I've never ordered any food from there, but as a basic convenience store, it's decent. The staff was friendly, and they had an adequate number of cashiers, which allowed me to checkout quickly despite how business of the store. Plus, unlike CoGo's, you don't walk out of a GetGo smelling you dipped your clothes in the deep fryer while looking for the perfect soft drink and bag of chips.

Unfortunately, like nearly all GetGo locations in the city, those darn FuelPerks create havoc no matter how well Giant Eagle improves the lot. When you give someone $.20 off per gallon, the potential for confusion and aggression are somehow increased. The result? Overly-crowded parking lots with lines of cars waiting to be filled with discounted gas and people who somehow forget driving etiquette. It's a frenzy I tend to avoid...until I'm to a $1.00 off...then I'll jump into the GetGo gas station mosh pit like the rest."}
{"text":"Awesome newly renovated local gas station, convenience store with made to order sandwiches, wraps, breakfast sandwiches. Tasty coffee selection, donuts, fountain drinks, and slushies. Hot dogs with toppings bar including chili and nacho cheese. Free wifi in the sitting area. You can also pick up your Redbox DVD rentals here.

Part of Giant Eagle so use your Advantage card for discounts and fuel savings. Also frequent beverage card only takes like 5 purchases to earn a free one...

Oh yeah, they sell gas... No car wash after the renovation though.

Oh how I wish we had these in Seattle..."}
{"text":"This review is for this Getgo only. I hate this Getgo. During the day it is nearly impossible to get on a pump. Cars will back up 3 and 4 waiting for a pump. This also makes navigating through the parking lot a complete exercise in stunt driving between cats sitting, randomly and suddenly moving to try and get to a soon to vacate pump or just pedestrians playing frogger through the lot. Then trying to get out either exit on Baum or Morewood is no picnic either. 

This though is only a mild irritant. My major complaint is when you try to go here during the later hours. After dark this place becomes absolutely horrendous. First when you park outside you will be accosted by very aggressive \"beggars\". I use this term loosely because begging implies some level of humility. These urchins are downright threatening. And there is usually several of them. Then you get inside just to find people sleeping in the store or just watching TV. The worst part, they are clearly not customers and they smell. 

I refuse to spend any time or money at this location. I have so many other choices for gas and shopping I don't need to waste and time or money here."}
{"text":"I absolutely hate this gas station. First off, it's hard to maneuver here. The layout is just horrible. Cars are always coming and going. And secondly you would think since this is Giant Eagle related, any sale that they have would be the same as the stores. For example, windshield washer fluid was 2 for $5. I didn't need 2, so one should have been $2.50. Oh no...not here. They told me that since it wasn't GE,  I would need to purchase both for the sales price. Nope, not me. So I left."}
{"text":"The service has gotten a lot  better since what looks a new manager took over.  I am usually there very early morning and past encounters have been awful.  One example. Clerk behind counter was always flirting with guys and getting or giving out her number. Totally ignoring orders. 
She hasn't been there in last month or so and service has gotten a lot better. I get my order in less than ten minutes. Not 25."}
{"text":"GetGo is great.  This GetGo is not.  I am certain this is the busiest gas station in the city, and  with a very small parking lot in a very high traffic part of town, it is always one step away from a fender bender just to get into a parking space.  And if you think you're going to get into a pump without circling at least twice...good luck.  The air pump is often broken, and the women's restroom is really really in need of a cleaning.  I mean the type of cleaning with a power washer :(   My overall impression is they just can't handle the incredibly high traffic and amount of customers that the larger GetGo can manage.  Take a deep breath if you have to use this gas station...you're going to need a fill up of patience."}
{"text":"This place is always rockin'. Customer service is decent and they carry beer. The parking lot is a mess because there are so many cars. I mean so many cars. Seriously when I walk or bike over I have to be careful that I don't get run over. Getgo sandwiches are ok too; nothing compares to Sheetz though. I do like having Getgo close by for last minute, in a hurry kind of stuff."}
