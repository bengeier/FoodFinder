{"text":"I ordered a chicken Slovakia and a poutine. The first bite was a chunk of very undercooked chicken. The poutine was inedible. I had one bite it was over salted and tasted like pure grease. I ate exactly one bite from each item and I'm not a picky eater, in fact I will eat just about anything."}
{"text":"I am not one to actually make reviews although I love yelp and appreciate all the feedback from customers. This is why I need to do this. 

DO NOT EAT FROM THIS PLACE.

I got this contact from Just Eats. I thought okay, decent price, okay menu items, why not? I can list you all the things that went wrong. My family and I ordered by calling them and telling them what we wanted them to deliver. They could not understand that I wanted the fries from my combo changed to a poutine. They tried to charge me for an extra poutine. I had to explain to them slowly what I wanted and that I will pay the difference. On top of that, it was a min order of $20 with free delivery. They wanted to charge me delivery after I totalled $28 before taxes. I was annoyed by that. Next, when I gave my address, she couldn't understand my street name after I spelled it out 5 times. Oh and it get's better. They couldn't find my place, called me numerous times to say they are at the front and want me to come out to pick up the food. Like c'mon, what's the point of delivery if they don't come to your doorstep? Annoyed and to get it over with, I went outside and they were not there. They went to two wrong buildings at streets far away from mine even after explaining so many times where I lived. When they finally came to my place, my brother came outside to give the money and the delivery guy advised him they have no change to give back to him! So you deliver, want to charge me delivery when the ad says \"free\" and come to deliver food with no change?!?!?!! Worst service ever!

Not only that, the food was horrible. I am not one to waste food but I couldn't finish my poutine, my brother's burger didn't come with cheese as indicated in the menu, my dad who LOVES fries and gravy couldn't even finish the meal. It was horrible - horrible service, horrible food.

Do yourself a favour and do not order from the place or you will just be wasting your money."}
{"text":"Best buffet in Gastonia! Lots of variety. My tastebuds were so confused between the Asian and American foods. I do like sushi but I did not try any but it looked very good. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Yummmm!!!!!!!! Went on a friday night , 4 adults and 2 kids. 12.99 per adult like really?! Thats a great price for buffet plus sushi (consider no crab legs) Every person in our party was happy and said great things when we sat down with our first plates.

We moved her from the north and are always apprehensive about finding food we feel is up to par with what we are used to. Will definitely be coming back, soon!

The only thing I could complain about is that the waitress barely knew any english and i would have like to have clear communication and not feeling confused or if she knew what the heck we were saying. But because we enjoyed ourselves we can easily overlook this."}
{"text":"I'm not a buffet fan. It seems impossible to serve buffet-style and keep the food from bring dried out and tasteless (Except for The Lady and Sons in Savannah, but that's a different review!). That being said, my husband loves a buffet... and hates Asian food.

So, Passion Grill works out really well for both of us! I tried 4 types of sushi, a potsticker and a spring roll from the buffet side. The sushi tasted pretty good but was a little dried out (not enough to keep me from eating it). I liked that I could take as much or as little pickled ginger and wasabi to go as I liked. The potsticker was really good, but the spring roll was barely edible. I wasn't able to identify any of the ingredients in the filling - yucky.

What I had from the stir fry line was awesome, and definitely worth repeating. I got to pick my ingredients and what type of sauce they used. Good stuff and well prepared. One word of caution - the crab on the stir fry station is that fake stuff with the oddly rubbery texture. I don't even want to think about the miracle of chemistry it took to create that stuff!"}
{"text":"Great buffet! Very large selection on different types of food from chineese, Japanese, american, and mexican! The sushi selection is awesome! They have everything labeled so you know what you are getting the hibachi has a nice selection of things to be cooked for you. They have prime rib at the grill! It's a little more expensive than you normal buffet at $12 an adult but it's worth it! Very clean and nicely decorated. Lots of room around buffet so you have lots of room to move around. Great dessert options as well including a chocolate wonder fall!"}
{"text":"Worst food I've had in Gastonia hands down. Went in craving Chinese and everything I tried was cold, stale or just plain disgusting. Would have been better off eating at the local gas station."}
{"text":"There are very few buffets that can accommodate the variety of my family but this is one them.  With lunch being 6.99 not only is it affordable but the hibachi and sushi are to die for!"}
{"text":"My husband and I completely enjoyed our experience here! I sincerely appreciated the quality and flavor of the prime rib and the sushi was not your typical buffet type rolls. I shared with the waitress how much I liked the prime and she said they have been through several attempts to find a good one. That impressed me! In fact, I went to their competitor in the same strip mall area and paid for their prime rib special that was more than I paid for my entire buffet here and was extremely disappointed. 

I loved the hibachi - I gather all the ingredients I love and she cooked it for me with my choice of sauce.

This place is definitely steps above the normal buffet food. I was also impressed to see all the kitchen areas pulling down components above grills and cleaning them."}
{"text":"The Passion Grill has been permanently closed, and this location has now become a Grill and Sushi Bar place.   Since I'm not a fan of Sushi, this location is now off of my 'Go To' places to eat."}
{"text":"Hibachi was good, there was a big selection to choose from The sushi wasnt typical buffet sushi either, it was more presentable and tasted better than sushi from other asian buffets. I didnt like the lighting in the restaurant and some food items were stale from the bar. Overall it was a good experience for the price"}
{"text":"This place is clean and new, empty, but the burgers are revolting. These people no absolutely nothing about burgers. I had a bacon cheese burger, no sides, to go, for $8.40: wilted lettuce and tomato, fake cheese - Kraft slices for gods sake!, and the bacon was some sort of fried spam slices. Barf. So inedible! Don't eat here! They would be packed if they just stuck with falafels or something else. U might as well go to McDonald's."}
{"text":"Can't beat the price for lunch - foods above average. The staffs always friendly.  The hibachi options a bonus"}
{"text":"great. ..I love coming here. wish I could come  alot  more  ..maybe  things will  get better where  I can come more. I hope an pray. *help me Lord room come here more..Thanks for wonderful. food. ..LOVE YOU AND THE FOOD..GOD BLESS YOU ALL AN ALL. THE GOOD  FOOD....!"}
{"text":"Typical asian buffet style food place that sells everything over the sun.  The inside is huge.  Lots of seating.  From fresh sushi to hibachi.  Salad bar on deck.  All the chinese cuisine  you can ask for.  American soul food on deck.  BBQ and a  huge desert tray to the side.  Somewhere between 3 and 4 stars.  If you feel like binging on food, the asian style buffet maybe the way to go.


Grade: C"}
{"text":"Not overly impressed! Huge, clean restaurant with several buffet stations filled with \"filler foods\". Old cold tacos and disgusting Mac and Cheese, stale dessert/bread section and over priced!! Totally not worth $15 a person! Will not be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good buffet. Bars well stocked and food was well cooked and tasty. About what you would expect at a good buffet. Ham was excellent as was all of the different chicken offerings. A large variety, real sets this place apart from other local buffets. Dessert bar is awesome. Cobblers, caked, rolls, pies, cookies, you name it. Hot strawberry cobbler, topped with vanilla ice cream and sprinkles! This is no joke... 
 Only complaint, table was dirty and I asked the young man who took my drink order to clean it. When I returned it had not been touched. He blew me off and did not return. 
 Waitress was excellent and made sure we were not wanting of anything. Drinks were kept full and she was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Used to go there when it was Planet Fitness.  Went there on the first day it was open and was mistaken for the Mayor of Gastonia.  It is one of my favorite places to eat because of the AYCE sushi.  I am a fan.  My granddaughter says it is her absolute favorite.  I've been back many times.  Never have to wait to be seated.  Wait staff is very attentive and prompt.  I can't believe the weekday lunchtime price.  I hope they can stay in business with those prices.  Sunday, we ate in the enclosed meeting room.  Noticed they have a video projector and screen for meetings.  I'll keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Huge selection of food, from Chinese, Japanese, and American.  Great desserts to pick from...you can't go wrong with a chocolate fondo fountain.  There'd also a grill where you can choose your raw food too get cooked.  I will deff go back if I get the chance."}
{"text":"I've got to say first, if you're looking for a good varirty priced buffett .... this is not it. For the amount you pay, I would expect more foods that can be made into the type of meal you want, instead it's a hodgepodge of unrelated cuisines next to one another that may share 1 ingredient together. I've been here a few times, and never by choice. 

One particular time has haunted me ever since. Waitress was obviously not skilled in her position and poured Pepsi on to our plates... with the food on it. No apology, no 'let me get you another plate', nothing. The wait staff since has only gone past the expectation of not spilling soda on our food. The management staff didn't seem to care and weren't willing to fix the situation either. 

The food is usually pretty luke warm. as I stated above, the foods do not compliment one another well. The meat section feels like you're eating meat back from your high school cafeteria. The sushi is poorly constructed and typically stale. The dessert bar is extensive however like everything else is left out too long and chews like hard candy. 

I go back not by choice but because it's one of the few places others in my family enjoy; thankfully they are beginning to see why I don't like it and see the other options available in Gastonia."}
{"text":"As buffet style goes, this is as good as it gets. For service (the type one expects in a self-serve-food buffet) was consistently unobtrusive, very polite and timely. Food was fresh, heat tables clean. Hibachi offerings had good variety and the man on the flat-top was on point. Enjoyed the place, the meal and the '60s soundtrack which inspired a little happy banter between guests! Seating isn't bullpen type with tables crowded together, but well spaced and booths if preferred. All in all a pleasant evening after a difficult and long day.
Impressed by roving quality/cleanliness person. Moving continually throughout the restaurant and directing staff to to anything needing attention."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.  A great lunch value considering the wide variety of options available.  An award winning meal?...perhaps not, but you can't find too many local restaurants that will appease those with large appetites.  Friendly and helpful staff.  Be prepared to leave smelling like the hibachi grill."}
{"text":"I knew going in that it wasn't going to be fabulous, but thought I'd give it a try because the boyfriend loves asian food and I knew I would have other options. I was looking forward to the hibachi but it was pretty disappointing. There were a couple dishes that were fairly good but I don't even remember what they were. The dessert bar was lacking too. I would not return."}
{"text":"If I could rate this place a 2.5, I would simply for the fact it's an interesting experience.

My boyfriend and I got a brochure advertising the place as a \"Bakery, American grill, Asian and Mexican food\" and thought we'd give it a try. Granted, we arrived with low expectations, but we didn't realize how bad it was really going to be. After all, how can you bake, be a sushi master, an excellent steakhouse and a taco expert all in one?

Finding a diamond in the rough would probably be easier than finding decent food at this buffet. The best choices were by far the hibachi and vegetarian sushi. I also grabbed some spring rolls as well which were fine. There aren't any sauces available other than dressings and soy sauce unless you ask your waitress, so we had to request ketchup and duck sauce. Everything we tried was completely underwhelming and some of it was just outright terrible. We don't waste a lot of food, but one bite of the mac and cheese, fried okra, bland desserts and soggy fries were enough for us.

The upside, is that is was sort of a fun place to go. It is very unique and there are tons of choices. This buffet is well priced too, given the quantity of options you have. If you are super hungry or have a need to binge (or if you're hungover for that matter) than this is the place to go. Enjoying your international fiesta of baked goods/Mexican/Asian/American cuisine in lighting fit for a strip club has some odd charm. We actually really enjoyed ourselves, but the point of going to a restaurant is for the food, not the company. Needless to say, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"I like the selection I really like that they cater for everyone it's definitely family friendly they have a dish for everyone in the family no matter what your choice is. The hibachi part is nice you can choose what you want and they cook it for you and I love the sushi bar they have so many different kinds I was shocked ."}
{"text":"Very nice buffet. Huge assortment of dishes to choose from, with Sushi as well Hibachi. Waitress was great at keeping our glasses filled and removing finished plates. The price was very reasonable  (we went for lunch) and we will definitely return when we are back in this area."}
{"text":"My family and I absolutely love Passion Grill. It is one of our favorite places to go. It has a unique ambience and variety of foods. Our favorite is the hibachi where you have.an array of ingredients to choose from. The prime rib is also very good. The only things I'm not overly pleased about is the desserts and American food selections, but I did not go there for either. My son had his 11th birthday dinner party here price was decent and the staff was very warm, welcoming, as well as helpful. Everyone had a great time."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Not the best but good for a buffet. Can't beat the price to get full for lunch."}
{"text":"Heres the deal. Its a chinese buffett with a selection of american food as well. Its pretty nice inside and is HUGE.  Dessert bar is awesome and has a lot of yummy stuff. The chinese food selection is only decent. The sushi selection is bigger than most buffetts but lets face it buffett sushi is usually gross. The downside is the dinner price. Several dollars more than Dynasty down the street. Realistically the price doesnt justify the slightly larger variety over a normal buffett. Im still on the fence for this place. Also has pepsi only. Gross"}
{"text":"Great place. Good specials and GREAT QUALITY. 

Some people bitch and moan about this place because of prices. They are used to places like the \"Die-Nasty\". Take a look online at other places health ratings. Then take a look at the health grade for this place. 

I don't know about you but I will throw in an extra few bucks to eat in a better place."}
{"text":"I actually liked this place. There was hella variety and the Hibachi grill alone was worth going. I wish they had a little more sushi variety and took a little more care with the bakery area. The bakery was especially dry and just kinda icky with so many messy people running through there. I guess that is kind of uncontrollable with a buffet though. The food was hot and fresh and tasty. Even the prime rib that we had was good. I was impressed with this place and I am usually not a fan at all of buffet setting because of the mass germiness of them (At least this this night there were no kids running about with their fingers stuck in everything). No, the price......*sigh* $16 for a dinner buffet. That to me was a little high. There are a lot of choices and there is a lot of food, but I am not a person that will go in and gorge themselves on all that fattty food just because it's a buffet. If I were to \"eat my money's worth,\" as we heard a couple times while eating, I'd gain about 30lbs in one sitting. If I had a complaint, that would be the only one. $16 for a buffet is a little much. I'd go back but it'd be for a lunch time price that would be more reasonable."}
{"text":"Love this place! Favorite part is the raw bar & sushi bar. They cook the raw food hibachi style with your choice of sauce. It's a buffet but not a cheesy or corny one. Very laid back & revamped. My bf loves their steaks. I live for the sushi! Back when we had the money for it, this was my favorite haunt."}
{"text":"Not consistent.  Been there once and it was amazing, the next time it was terrible.  The service is always pretty poor, but the food is usually good.  Big variety of food.  It's a gamble, it might be awesome and it might be terrible."}
{"text":"Tried again and again was not impressed with the quality of some of the foods. However, I gave it a few more stars this time because the sushi and hibachi grill were absoluely delicious and we were even able to try some FRESH desserts."}
{"text":"I have to say, I found several of the \"bad\" reviews amusing.  This is a reasonably priced All You Can Eat buffet.  It has nice selection of food for a variety of taste buds.  I have always found plenty to eat.  Not only do they have a Hibachi Grill but they also offer Grill Steaks for dinner.  

This isn't a high end restaurant.  They will have imitation crab meat and limited seafood. It's a buffet.  You're not going to get ribeye steaks or lobster.  Seriously??!!

Staff is VERY attentive. Everything is clean. Never had a problem.  Be realistic.  It's good food at a fair price."}
{"text":"Lots of options and I've always been satisfied. The hibachi alone is worth the price. You can't get this many options for the price anywhere else in Gastonia."}
{"text":"I go for lunch it's a descent price and we always hit up the sushi and hibachi so it's well worth it. 

Love the lighting and the staff is always nice too."}
{"text":"We just about gave up trying to find it but if you circle the building past the Hamrick's and the beauty supply store, you'll find it.  The place is huge.  The food was cheap and hot and fresh. It's certainly good as far as buffets go.  It was clean and the service was very prompt."}
{"text":"So this is probably the worst experience that I have ever had. I was really excited to try passion grill for my first time because I had heard great things from.my friends and family. My first trip to the grill ended with me getting the wrong sauce because the gentleman behind the grill just was not paying attention. So I decided to give it another try and this time my rice and shrimp  where really under done to the point the the rice was still crunchy. So I decided to go back and try the food on the other bars. The sesame chicken was completely over sauced to the point that all I could taste was the sauce the rest of the night. The whole time this is happening the wait staff is rushing my table to hurry up and finish.  So now when I go up to pay I speak to the lady behind the counter and tell her that I did not enjoy any of my food. So she asks me how many plates I had and how much I ate. I only ate 4 potatoes in total. So she tells me it's to late to speak to a manager or even talk to anyone. So payed. This was my first and last time at this establishment."}
{"text":"Another buffet restaurant in gastonia. Huge place. Kid friendly  lots of choices. Much is prepackaged  fried and carb heavy. There is a salad station that is some fresh options The best part is the stir fry station where you pick your ingredients and sauce and then it is cooked in front of you while you wait   Not expensive  food mill"}
{"text":"I ate here on Friday night and regret it, especially for the price point ($12.99 + tax/tip). I should have stayed on the Northend of Charlotte and went to China Buffet at University instead ($12.99 as well with a much wider selection and better quality).

Normally I check the items on a new buffet before eating, but as I arrived at 8:45 PM (they close at 10PM) I took a chance and decided to just go ahead and take a seat and order. What a mistake that was.

The buffet area looks large, but the way it is set up and spread out, there actually isn't a lot on offer. The \"Chinese\" dishes were minimal (no mussels in black bean sauce, no sauteed green beans, no salt and pepper shrimp, etc, not even General Tso's Chicken). There were a lot of American dishes such as fried chicken tenders, mashed potatoes, pot roast, \"prime rib\", and several other offerings that you'd find at Golden Corral or Hometown Buffet. 1/3 of the buffet area is actually only desserts (extensive), a salad bar, and toppings to put on ice cream.

Okay, I got my sad plate of food to take back to my table, which had very little seafood on it since there were only three or four seafood dishes on offer (two of which contained fake crab). I should be saved on this $13 Chinese buffet by the sushi, right (yes I'm aware not to expect much out of buffet sushi)?!?

Wrong! There were all of six plates of sushi out, all of which were maki rolls (for those unfamiliar with the types of sushi, maki rolls have rice on the outside and fish on the inside, meaning little fish and a lot of rice), and one type per plate. Only one of said plates had real fish in it (vs imitiation crab).

It is reaching 9PM and they do close at 10PM, so maybe they just aren't putting out more sushi so as not to be wasted, and I can request some nigiri/sashimi cuts?

Wrong! Want a special roll or special order? Per several signs posted, expect to pay $5+ extra for each roll/order, if the itamae were still even there (he wasn't).

So I trudge back to my table to eat my food, which surprisingly had flavour (MSG most likely) but was luke warm and congealed from sitting in warming pans for too long (I literally witnessed an employee pouring hot water into congealed gravy and stirring it to make it \"fresh\" again).

Ok, regretting more than ever my choice to eat here, let's try the \"star\" of the place, the hibachi grill shall we?

I loaded up my plate with broccoli, onions, mushrooms, and shrimp (51/60 at largest), and then proceeded to the chef to have my \"saving grace\" cooked fresh. It takes him about 7 minutes and then voila! Done!

I take it back to my table with final hopes, pull out my new pair of chopsticks (since the waitstaff cleared my old ones), and dig in...

Tasteless... no sweetness from the shrimp... no bite from the onions... no crunch from the broccoli... no umami from the hibachi sauce... nothing...

Overall I was EXTREMELY disappointed by both Passion Grill and Yelp for this experience.

For $7-8 it would have been an okay (but not pleasant) experience.

For $13, I could have had a MUCH better buffet experience at many other locations in the Charlotte area.

Save your money and skip this one!!!"}
{"text":"For lunch you can't go wrong.  The price is fair and the food is good, but not amazing.  I have had dinner here once and the Prime Rib WAS amazing. 
Not my favorite place, but not bad either."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Have tons of selection. Have hibachi, Sushi, desert, salad and Grill!!! Can't try everything at one time. Will comeback for the other food. The price is awesome. Great place to eat."}
{"text":"I have to say for a buffet, I was impressed. When pulling in, you have to drive around the end of the strip mall to find the door. It was strange at first because pulling in, you'd think they were closed. 

Once inside, the place is huge. Looks newly remodeled as their buffets are fancier than most places and there's a ton of seating. 

I tried their sushi and several Chinese dishes including black pepper chicken (my favorite), General's, and sesame chicken. The potsticker was hard as if they'd sat out for too long. But other than that the food was fresh and they have a lot of options. Plus you can get hibachi made fresh. Our waitress was very attentive and made sure to keep our drinks full and our plates cleared. Someone in our party had said they had fresh steamed clams on the bar, but they didn't the day we were there. After asking our waitress about them, they had a whole pan freshly made and even delivered them to our table for my boyfriend's little brother. 

I would definitely return again the next time I get a hankering for Chinese food."}
{"text":"this is by far the best buffett i have ever eaten. anyone who gives this place a bad review must be crazy. the massive selection of food is great and the freshness of it makes it superb. hibachi grill is the best i ever had and the prime rib was better than i have gotten in some fancy dining establishments. i will definitely be a regular"}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome as far as Chinese Buffets go. The selection is vast and the quality is good. Their American selection and desserts are great too. Plus - 5.99 for lunch!!!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give it another half star instead of just 3, but it wasn't bad. For a buffet, it was pretty good, not crazy about buffets but my husband and I are new to the area and trying out different restaurants. We liked the hibachi part but wish we stopped there, wasn't really impressed with anything else. The service was okay, nothing to jump up and down about. They do have a great discount for military and police/fire. All in all, not sure if we'll be back."}
{"text":"Customer since your very first day.  Ate there Sunday at 7:30. With Tip was 39 bucks.  The food was really bad except for a small dish from the hibachi grill. No selection of sushi and the food was old, soup was dried up. Wait staff Leah was great though and I did not think she should Miss out on a good tip due to the food. We are regulars but may not return.  This is not the first time but was really bad this time and I needed to let someone know.  It was a waste of money.  Update:  have returned several times and has been bad each time. Contacted the manager and he was very nasty. Refused to return. Name changed to Gastonia Grill. Visited and it was the same thing as before. We will not return."}
{"text":"The Japanese grill was very good. The buffet items were bland at best. Huge dessert station. Better than expected. Will be back."}
