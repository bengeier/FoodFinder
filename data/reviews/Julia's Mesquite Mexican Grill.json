{"text":"My buddy has been telling me about this place. So my wife and I had to check this gem out. I walked in and automatically fell in love with the mesquite aroma. Man does this place smell amazing!!! We were greeted promptly and asked if we've ever been in? \"This is our first time in\" She gave us the rundown on the menu, explained the food options in front of us; and.... gave us samples of everything!!!  I couldn't even process how amazing everything is there. The flavor profiles are so advanced for the style of food that they create. The portions are large, the staff is friendly, the homemade drinks are fantastic, and the food is very FRESH. Julia's is number one in my books. I could eat the food there everyday! Thank you for your hospitality and I will continue to dine with you for a very long time."}
{"text":"Great new location with delicious food fantastic service! Do yourself a favor and order enough for seconds."}
{"text":"I tried this place because it was new and close by. The way you order and navigate to pay seems a little cumbersome when they are busy. I have tried a couple burritos but you must be careful when you start adding stuff to it or you will end up with an almost $10 burro. I'm not into fillers (rice) in my burros so when ordered without the burro seems small for the price. They use a huge tortilla to make it so you end up with a lot of extra tortilla. For the price and comparable places near by they need to use at least twice the meat for the money. Their red hot sauce is hot and really good. They do have a good salsa bar. I have not tried the hamburgers but they look good. I'm hoping they get dialed in and things improve."}
{"text":"This place is great! I'm a burrito junkie and since  this place opened I've had the carne asada, green chilli,  barbacoa, and marinated pork burritos. I would rate all of them great, but  the carne and the green chili are to die for. The burritos are huge so prepare yourself for leftovers!!"}
{"text":"My breakfast burrito was yummy and filling. We were greeted immediately upon entering the restaurant, the same guy took our order and prepared it quickly. I got the steak, bacon and egg with cheese breakfast burrito (which is served all day) and a water. The burrito was a little dry for my taste (thats the reason for -1 star), could have used some sour cream in it. But the place was clean (the bathroom too) and the staff was friendly. I totally recommend Julia's!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best Mexican food I have had in so long.  It features an open kitchen, so you are able to see the food being prepared and cooked from start to finish.  It is always clean, well lit and the staff is polite. It is non-greasy especially in comparison to other Mexican restaurants.  The portion sizes are great for the cost.  You can't beat the awesome mesquite savor that comes from the mesquite grill.   There is a sizeable eating area, which makes it great for groups.  I highly recommend getting the Carne Asada fries.  Either way you can't go wrong with anything on the Menu."}
{"text":"Poor experience.  No signs to tell you where to order.  Poor customer service. Took over 10 minutes to order because the order taker was distracted.  Cheese enchiladas were just rolled tortilla with sauce. Chicken tacos were cold and unfavored. Refried  beans were decent. I won't go back."}
{"text":"Authentic. Clean. Inviting.   This place is on point! The flavors literally brought back memories from past trips to places like Chiapas and Guatemala! I had the machaca burrito and it was delicious. The wife and son both ordered the huevos rancheros plate and everyone agreed that it was truly authentic! And the horchata...best in Arizona! This is definitely our new Mexican joint!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight and am very disappointed.  I had the rolled tacito plate and the wife had beef tacos.  The meat in the tacito's was some kind of beef, kind of a paste that they rolled into a ball and then into a long string before rolling it into the tortilla.  Taco beef was full of fat and grisal, left a coating of fat on the roof of the mouth.  Other restaurants in the area don't have to worry about this place, it took them longer to open than they will be in business"}
{"text":"Their street tacos are outstanding.  The meat flavors are amazing and the prices are great!"}
{"text":"So excited to have a new restaurant in the area. Not only that, but it is delicious! So far I have had the barbacoa, the grilled chicken, and a chorizo breakfast burrito.  They have a lot of really good salsas to choose from.  Everything i have tried so far has been amazing. On top of all that, the people working here are really nice. We will be regulars here for sure."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Cheap, really good food, and the service was very nice and fast! Definitely will be coming back again. Carne asada tacos were bomb!"}
{"text":"My husband and father went there today for take out for lunch.  They were dissatisfied with the ordering and yelling grill cook. My mother got her take it order of enchiladas with rice and beans.  The beans had this piece of wire from a steel scrubber ! I called and the woman who answered never apologized, just said bring it back and we'll give you a new one of equal or lesser value.  Oh well,  good fid but poor customer service and operations."}
{"text":"Why isn't this place packed with people! Filibertos isn't even close!!!!   Get over here and eat some food people!!!  It's delicious!!!  And the food is amazing!!!     I will be back tonight and tomorrow.  hope to see you and others join me."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. I've been I just found out about it and I've been there 3 times this week. The workers are super nice, the food has great flavor, and portions or awesome. Seriously love the unique flavor. Yumm!"}
{"text":"I went to Julia's for the first time this evening and was extremely disappointed and will NOT be coming back. I ordered a chile verde burrito and watched as they poured 98% sauce and 2% pork onto my tortilla. I also was asked if I wanted cheese, but was not told that it cost extra. Come on, extra for cheese at a Mexican restaurant?! I also find out as I go to pay for my food that first of all, I was being charged for cheese, and second that I was also getting charged for using a card ($.25 for cheese and $.40 for the card). I know it is not a large amount but it basically adds an extra dollar to the already nearly vegetarian burrito.  I sit down at the table and open the burrito to inspect it and sure enough, three little squares of pork is all I got. I went up to the counter and had the employees inspect the miserly amount of meat I was given. They sheepishly plopped about a tablespoon more on my burrito, looked at me like I was some whiny pig, and sent me on my way. The flavor of my burrito was good however; my black beans were still a bit dry and pasty (clearly under cooked so my poor wife will probably have to deal with my gas all night). I went with 6 other people and they all seemed to enjoy their food and had double the size burrito I had and about triple the amount of meat. I guess in the end I will say, if you decide to eat there, stay away from the chile verde burrito unless you are a vegetarian,because you will leave feeling unsatisfied and jipped. Again, the food wasn't bad but food portions are inconsistent, food preppers should do a better job of saying what costs extra and finally, it is just plain tacky and backward to charge the customer for using a card!"}
{"text":"Nachos and meat are really good. The staff is very pleasant and overall the restaurant is good for lunch."}
{"text":"Very annoying when I'm always in the same shopping center everyday and every single day they put their flyers on my car and everyone else's. Not only is it a violation of people's property but is very annoying and upsetting to know people are touching my car and other cars."}
{"text":"Wow - We've been to this place at least 4 times and it's delicious every time!  Pros: -Delicious, freshly made taquitos -Good tasting rice and beans -Great street tacos - recommend the pastor and chicken -Breakfast burritos are delicious and huge!  Cons: -Not open on Sundays :(  I want to guesstimate that average cost per person to eat and get a drink is about $10-12/person. Will definitely keep returning!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of their breakfast burritos! I've tried bacon and steak with bacon. Perfect combination of eggs, bacon, potatoes and cheese in a fresh grilled tortilla. They are so big I have to split with someone. They charge 30 cents for using debit, which seems silly, but if you forget cash, it's still worth it."}
{"text":"Right when I entered the owner personally welcomed me to his establishment and offered me a sample of each the meats offered. After sampling each one I decided on a carne asada burrito and was not disappointed. I have been there several times and it has always been delicious, clean, and wonderful."}
{"text":"I have gone here four times since it has opened, and I must say it is fantastic.  Everyone is very friendly, and offering some of the best customer service I have found in Mesa.  They have some good daily specials, and serve breakfast all day long.  I personally love their breakfast tacos, which are fresh and made to order.  The setup is similar to a Chipotle, but this food is much fresher, and a lot of it is cooked after you order."}
{"text":"The family and I decided to try something new and decided to try this place out. My son and I ordered the chicken enchiladas with green sauce and they were so salty and they tasted sour to us as well. I will not be going here again."}
{"text":"This place is soooooo goood!!!! Yummy, cheap, clean and best of all, within walking distance to my house!!! Amazing burritos and love the salsa bar! So glad to have a good taco shop in this area, hard to find quality authentic taco shops that don't look super sketchy and leave you with a sour stomach. This is our new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfasts!   Buy one breakfast burrito and get the second at 1/2 price until 10am. (Not sure if this is a permanent promotion).   The chorizo breakfast plate is especially good.   They will make a bacon burrito if you ask.   Staff is always friendly.   Great salsa bar that isn't afraid to go HOT.   Have not been here for lunch or dinner, but we 100% recommend for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Food is delicious. The whole restaurant is emaculate! If the employees aren't making your food, they are cleaning. We have been several times over about a year or so and have never been disappointed.  Go, eat, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Been to the other location many times, so we couldn't wait for this one to open so close to home. Same great food. Taco Tuesday tonight. I had a carne asada, chile rojo, and marinated chicken - all on crunchy shells with pico, queso, and hot sauce. Awesome!  Going back soon to try the rest of the menu. Oh, and the horchata is fresh. Highly recommend! Go hungry.  Went for breakfast this morning. Had  chorizo and egg taco - It was GREAT. And only 1.50 - going to stock up on them next time. Also had the classic huevos rancheros with rice and beans. My only regret is that I ate it too fast. The food was great. The service was great. The price is right. I think I'm going back for breakfast tomorrow. Load up on them tacos."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the huge breakfast burritos. Took advantage of the buy one get one 50% off special. The salsa bar is excellent!"}
{"text":"We love this place and are so glad they opened up in the neighborhood. They have good carne asada and chicken tacos and their hamburgers are delicious. The owner is often working and is so friendly and helpful. They are always more than willing to answer questions about the menu or make suggestions. We also really like their flan. I'd say average price to get a meal and a drink is roughly around $10."}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight and had yummy street tacos.  The pork verde was really good, and my son had the carne asada, and he said it was really good. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible, I was lied to three times by three different employees.  I went in for 6 tacos togo and my order was made wrong, when I returned a couple hours later (with receipt and untouched food) the cashier told me she could not do anything to help because I did not call and report the issue...  I asked to speak to a manager and was connected with FRED.  I explained what went wrong to Fred, he told me to write down my information and I would be refunded, well it's been a month now and no call or refund has happened.  So If you want to pay $15.00 for a wrong order and get lied to multiple times Julia's off brown rd is the place to go.  I would give them -3 stars if I could, literally the worst place i have ever experienced, shame on them."}
{"text":"They have a special everyday and $1.50 taco Tuesday, hard or soft shell! Awesome meat selection and Agua Fresca, try the limonada."}
{"text":"The chicken was gross and the service sucked. I asked for a drink and the girl gave me water and then argued with me that I said I wanted water when she charged me for a drink. Will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Please please please please teach your younger workers the proper way to roll a burrito. Twice now I have gotten horribly built burritos because they seem not to know the proper way to build and roll a burrito. They are hurting the quality that is usually there."}
{"text":"Love the chorizo breakfast burrito! The marinated chicken is also great. Large portions. Great service. Clean place."}
{"text":"Been impressed since my first visit. I'll be coming back. 2 plates with the works and drinks for about 20 bucks."}
{"text":"Their menu has Jr burgers, Jr cheese burger , Jr other burger but actually they don't sell that. False advertisement I say! They only have the 1/3 lb burgers. Also no  kids meals available at this place."}
{"text":"Food taste good but a bit pricey. I don't like that they charge for extras like cheese guacamole sour cream ect. I heard others complaining about it. And no warning on the hot sauce that they put on my food that it's super hot it ruined my burrito and I like hot"}
{"text":"Our family was looking for good breakfast burritos to start our Saturday right. We have 6 kids, so it can be expensive to get a good meal out. Turns out Julia's was the ticket we were looking for. We had been there a few times before, but never for breakfast.  The woman serving us told us the burritos were really big so our little ones could share. So I ordered an egg and ham for our 3 yr old and 6 yr old to split. Our middle children and my wife each had the steak, egg and bacon burritos. My oldest son and I each had the egg and chorizo. The food only took about 10 minutes or so. The best part was when she brought them out, she offered a significant discount because she felt bad we had to feed so many kids! :-D We politely declined - it was a good deal at full price.  We brought them home to eat and we loved them! They were so big that many of us now have a meal waiting for us tomorrow morning!"}
{"text":"This place has so much to offer! From amazing breakfast burritos to flame grilled burgers for lunch. If you like chipotle? This is your new spot in this area! Check this place out! Right next to Barros pizza."}
{"text":"The marinated pork is excellent, real tasty smokey flavor. Burgers are also very good."}
{"text":"BASURA, that is what came to mind as I exhaustedly finished my meal. I got the nachos \"supreme\", nothing supreme about it. Meat was burnt and mainly fatty, chips were too salty, beans couldn't even be found. Overall worst nachos I have ever had period. If I want better Mexican food I will be driving a little further from now on. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"What a rip off! Never again. Save your money and give an authentic restaurant your business. Chicken, steak and pork very dry. I will say you could taste the mesquite. The pork burrito fell apart a quarter of the way through from all the grease saturating the tortilla. I was very exited about the concept, but the quality and the prices are out of line. Not a fan of the Berto's chains, but you'd be better off eating there."}
{"text":"Not exactly all that! Most of the meats are good but there was a few that were just plain. The pre-made taco shells are awful! Who does this, it takes no time at all to make them fresh. The price was right but for food that was short of exciting it should have been. I was anxious for this place to open in our neighborhood but it wasn't worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is our new neighborhood hotspot! Clean, open grill concept. Always friendly faces when you walk in - we have been here 4x now - the tacos were incredible there's multiple choices. I had carne Asada and the marinated chicken. My husband had green chile pork. My favorite is their taco salads. Amazing even Togo. I'm back today to review their Pozole but something tells me I won't be disappointed.  I hope to see this new place succeed!"}
{"text":"Yep. Burritos. This is the place. Actually the only burrito I've liked the wrap. Big enough for two meals. For me anyway. Fine salsa bar with superb variety and quality. I've not had a burrito anywhere else even close to the one here. Two negatives. Flimsy plastic knives and forks and light weight napkins. Maybe I'm just an especially messy eater.."}
{"text":"Wow! Great food. My only complaint is the cheapest plastic knives and forks that melt and flex so much its hard to cut anything. But the shop is clean, the people are friendly and seem to like working there. Everything I have had is excellent."}
{"text":"This is a brand new establishment and overall well done. Menus are on tv screens. They are not overly lengthy and prices are competitive. I am greeted quickly and order taken promptly. You walk along glass windows and select your options and pay.  It's fast fresh food and meats are cooked over wood! Salsa bar is great and hot is hot. Just watch the extras on the \"would you like cheese\" with your taco. It does cost more if ordering a la carte at the grand opening for street tacos. I missed it until I check receipt and thought well I guess I should have asked is it an \"additional\" cost? Did not think cheese was a typical extra unless we are talking burgers. I digress, check out the quesadilla as it was legit. Meats are cooked well and flavor is savory."}
{"text":"I didn't think you could improve a simple quesadilla but oh this is divine!  I have heard great things about this place and now that I've tasted it myself, I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Super fresh ingredients! Definitely worth stopping at. I had some of the best beans, rice, and chicken enchiladas there."}
{"text":"Large portions and very nice staff. Food tasted great. Clean restaurant. Breakfast, lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Portion size for breakfast is great for the price- pretty good huevos rancheros- great selection of breakfast items but this place does not serve coffee, we were told we could run to Dunkin' Donuts if we wanted coffee and although they offer a punchcard for loyalty, they give one punch per visit no matter how many people you bring in or how much food you buy. I will say that the salsa bar is great and the refried beans are very tasty.  You would be smart to bring cash because they also charge $.40 per transaction to pay with card, but I get it it's pricey."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast burritos.  Yummy tortilla stuffed with bacon, egg, potato and cheese. Nice selection at the salsa bar, the green salsa was my favorite. I will be back to try more menu items."}
{"text":"We love their burritos!  They are very big and full of well seasoned meats,  yummy salsas and flavorful beans.  The Jamaica is some of the best I've ever had.  Couldn't ask for anything more!"}
{"text":"Loved it! I got two tacos w/rice & beans. One chicken (they had mild or spicy) and one beef. They were very tasty and they offer a choice of black, pinto or refried beans. Rice was PERFECT consistency & flavor! DEFINITELY will be back! Inside was VERY neat and clean too."}
{"text":"Ive never had the Mexican food there because the burgers are so darn good. I love the green chili burger. I guess I will have to try some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Way over priced. Canned Beans, little meat and a whole lot of flour tortilla. They roll the burritos loosely so that they can hide the little portion size. Never again. Snow bird beware"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place because it's a mom and pop operation, and it's right by my house. This place functions like a Chipotle. You pick a meat, and you can either do tacos, a burrito or a salad. (There is other stuff too). I have been there 3 times, and every single time they are so SKIMPY with the portions!!! The meat is good, but you get less than a spoonful in each taco! And the salad is hilarious. It's literally 3 tablespoons of lettuce, two spoons of meat and then everything else is also extremely skimpy. The only thing they give the normal amount in is rice and beans, but that is just a joke.   ADJUST YOUR PORTION SIZE SO THE PRICE MAKES SENSE.   Hoping this place gets it together so the neighborhood can have a Mexican joint and not have to drive so far. The staff is nice though, so there's that."}
{"text":"Amazing food with an excellent touch of all-things-needed on Saturday mornings! My wife and I love eating from this joint. It's quick, easy going, never packed and they are always on top of their game. Welcome to the neighborhood, Julia's!"}
{"text":"As a woman of Western European decent, I should not be able to wipe the floor with the local Arizona Mexican restaurant, but here we are. I could out cook this place blindfolded with two hands tied behind my back.  As someone born and raised in the southwest, I have a strong respect for the flavors we have available to work with, so when I order food from a Mexican restaurant, I expect them to be at least partially present.  I have never (and I am not being dramatic at all) tasted more flavorless food in my life.  This reminds me of what it would be like if I lived in a small Midwest town where no one had ever eaten experienced Mexican cuisine.  We ordered Chicken Enchiladas, Cheese Enchiladas, Quesadillas, Rolled Tacos, Regular Tacos, beans, rice, salsa and Tres Leches cake and absolutely none of it was even touched with seasoning--of any kind. No heat. No texture. Zero flavor. Nothing.  I wish I were exaggerating, but instead, I am left questioning why anyone would invest in owning a restaurant when they do clearly lack passion for food.  What a disappointment. $60 down the toilet and frustration at the community for giving a restaurant 4/5 stars when it so clearly missed the point."}
{"text":"A solid 4 stars.  Glad to have a new tasty & clean Mexican place in this part of Mesa.  Tried a variety of street tacos, which were , and washed it down  with mango Jarritos.  Update:  have since returned a couple of times.  I really liked the jalapeño burger, it was delicious.  Will continue to visit Julia's.  Hope they get their Sonoran hot dogs started soon."}
{"text":"The best chili verde. Ever. The taco salad is amazing and so are the breakfast tacos. The first week we discovered Julias, we came to eat 4 or 5 times. It's that good."}
{"text":"Tasty food. The tacos and burritos are very good. My wife and kids really like the mesquite grilled burgers too. They opened in Mesa only a couple months ago (the location I visit). One thing: they say they have Sonora dogs on the menu but they don't yet. They need to source a provider of bolillos I was told. They need to work on this because I would like to try the Sonora dogs!  So nice having a close Mexican option. The mesquite grill sets them apart from the usual taco shop suspects. Give them a try. Good stuff and the staff is very nice."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there are so many 4 and 5 star ratings for this place. I've been a couple times and the best I can give it is a so-so.  Kinda pricy, made worse by a extra charge if you pay with plastic; confusing menu; and food that doesn't cut it, including the worst onion rings I have ever had."}
{"text":"I like the Julia's in Chandler.  This one was just meh.  Not bad, not good...just meh."}
