{"text":"A bit overpriced and the customer service isn't the greatest - a little on the detached, frosty-side.  But, the enchiladas are amazing - the main reason we keep going back."}
{"text":"Best tamales, beans and rice ever!! Also love their enchiladas,Chile rellenos-enchilada style, and tacos:)"}
{"text":"Wow... The food here is delicious! The decor is not the best and the styrofoam plates and cups and plastic forks and seat your self is Linda Twilight Zoney... But once you get passed that this place is a gold mine! The tamales are SO good! The chicken tacos are all white meat and I love the rice.... And I usually don't eat the rice!! We both love it here as so does my mother now that we took her! The only thing that keeps me from a 5 star rating is that I like to be waited on and real plates and glasses and forks made of metal!"}
{"text":"I had the fish tacos. I asked for extra jalape√±os as I like my food spicy and for me even their spicy hot sauce was not spicy enough. They were served on corn tortillas, three to an order. The fish was crispy and I would recommend them."}
{"text":"Best burrito I have had in a long time. Good food good prices. Quick friendly service. I will be back."}
{"text":"Nice change of pace from the chain Mexican places that are plague on Phoenix. Food is good, service is always good and not sure why others complain about the decor. The daily specials are often very good and reasonable. This place obviously puts Macayo's and the other Mexican food places for very white people to shame...."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Very affordable and a great atmosphere. The owner was present and he was so fun. I love frequenting family owned businesses knowing that my money is staying in the community."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today on a whim. I've driven past this place hundreds of times and finally decided to give it a try. Besides the enviroment (the tacky decorations, the bad music, the plastic silverware and styrafoam plates) that was bad, I can deal with that. I don't really put too much value in it as long as the food is good. Unfortunately, it was not. I ordered at the counter, and paid almost $11 for a combo plate with two tacos, beans and rice with a fountain drink. I felt that was really high, but sat down excited to get my food anyway. 

They give you a plastic tray with some chips and salsa and hot sauce. I thought it was all pretty bland and very forgettable. My food came out really quickly after I sat down. On my personal rating scale for Mexican food, where 1 is Taco Bell and 10 is the street tacos I had in Mexico, this food was about a 3. I'm not talking about \"authenticity\". I don't care if you want to call it that. It was gross and bland. The taco shells were hard, but not crunchy. They were more chewy, and gave the tacos their prevailing flavor: vegatable oil. The beans were runny and the rice was also really bland. I ended up dumping the taco contents out of the shell and trying to finish it that way. I really wanted to like this place because it is so close to work, so maybe I will try again sometime and order something else. Or maybe not."}
{"text":"This family has been serving Mexican food  to west valley residents for decades.  La Loma is a sister restaurant with another location that closed down a few years ago. The food here is always delicious and the service is friendly. Once they get to know you, you feel like family.

As others have said, it's not the traditional restaurant experience, but we go there for the food and not to be waited on. Stop in for a great lunch or dinner and make sure you try the hot sauce...it's amazing!"}
{"text":"My son has OT in the same parking lot, so I have come to this place a few times for lunch. First thing that turned me off was a huge tip jar they have in your face when you order. They have a sign saying that they prefer cash, and that 'credit card and debit card fees break small businesses'. Huh? The first thing I ate here was shrimp fajitas, which with drink was about $15. Very small portions and not worth it. Chips are ok, but the salsa and picante sauce are in squirt bottles...and cold as heck. If you want any kind of side, it costs a dollar or more. I got a burrito the next time I came here (it was good, the Healthy Bean one) and it is 5.50, but if you want sour cream, guacamole, and chicken (they try to press it on you) that will be another nearly 5 bucks. It's good but not very big. Drinks are in small styrofoam cups and cost 2 bucks. They have a sign saying NO OUTSIDE DRINKS. I can see why, they have a racket going here on their overpriced drinks. The straw that broke the camel's back is that I waited in line behind two people who couldn't make up their mind for twenty minutes, and the woman behind the counter tried to help the woman BEHIND me first. WTF? Not great service, food is ok with skimpy portions, cheapo atmosphere, TIP JAR in your face...skip this place."}
{"text":"This place is a terrible value.  For $9 my burrito better be good, huge or both.  At La Loma it was neither.  There is no kids menu so I even over paid for my children.  Top it all off with an order at the counter and eat off Styrofoam experience and there's no reason to go back.

I really liked the owner's old place, Arturo's, but La Loma has none of Arturo's great qualities.  We knew we had to try La Loma, now that we have, we'll never go back."}
{"text":"The best authentic Mexican in Litchfield Park. The owners and staff couldn't be friendlier and the patrons are always returning for more. Also they are the cleanest spot too."}
{"text":"Yes you do eat off of styrofoam plates and plastic utensils and drink from styrofoam cups. Yes you order at the counter and then seat yourself. Yes the inside decor isn't that great. But who cares?! This place is awesome. The dishes are very reasonably priced and the costumer service is great. They brought the food out very quickly. The food was very authentic and spicy which is how mexican food should be. I come from a Hispanic family and THIS is mexican food. Not that stuff Macayos and other \"white mexican\" resturaunts try to serve you. I reccomend everyone try this place at least once. You really won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had lunch with the family here today.  I had the red chili burrito enchilada style with rice and beans.  Overall I enjoyed my meal.  The place is clean, not overcrowded and the staff is friendly.  They have a connection to the valley that has spanned over 60 years, so that is kind of neat.  If the weather is nice there is also a small outside dining area to enjoy.  I'm kind of partial to another Phoenix only restaurant, so I feel like a trader when I eat elsewhere, however this was a decent alternative."}
{"text":"Always great food, service and atmosphere!!! We sat on the patio and really enjoyed ourselves. We love to support small businesses!!!!! Who cares what kind of plate the food is served on???? Unless your going to eat the plate!!!!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying I was too lazy to drive over to my favorite Mexican restaurant on Cinco De Mayo so I decided to give this place a second try. 
I ordered the Chili Colorado, what they called red chili beef. I received the smallest portion for $12. The meat was tough and flavorless. The corn tortillas were almost see thru and hard. It gets better the rice & beans were bland. I ate it because I was hungry but it was gross. On a positive note, they have friendly staff. They just desperately need a new cook. Overall, don't waste your money or appetite on this disgraceful Mexican food."}
{"text":"It was okay Mexican food, the beans and rice are good. I didn't like being served on foam plates and plastic silverware.  
Its okay if your with a big group and want everyone to pay for themselves Up front.
 Everyone was Very friendly."}
{"text":"Clunky!  Stand at the counter to order and food is brought out on disposable plates.  Bus your own drinks, chips and salsa.  Salsa cups are tiny and not big enough to dip your chips in.  Margarita was very weak but the food was okay.  Prices were what you would pay at a true dine in restaurant yet service and ambiance was equivalent to fast food."}
{"text":"My family and i went there for our first time tonight. We have been living in az for a bit over a year, and live right up the street and wanted to give it a try. We ordered up at the bar/ counter area and they gave us chips and salsa. Tasted ok.. Just drank water and order my two toddlers a bean and cheese burrito since they dont have a kids menu  and we each had a burrito and taco. Its way over prices and the food didn't even have much spice or flavor.. The owner or boss was loud and was visiting with some other guys and cussing in front of my toddlers! Everything you get or use cost money, ranch dressing $1.00?!? Really! We were not impressed! Save your money and cook at home or find another better place."}
{"text":"We enjoy La Loma Mexican Grille and their unique Tijuana carnitas in addition to their other solid items on their menu.  As to the service in La Loma Mexican Grille - yeah they may not be the most out going, but then again they aren't all over you as well.  Come in, go to the counter, order, find a seat and wait for your order to be called or brought to you.

Make sure you get both bottles for their salsa and taco sauce (which i prefer)."}
{"text":"I really do not like anything about this place. The inside of the building is depressing with horrible little tables and chairs. I do not even remember the folks working there so they must have been ok as they did not doing anything wrong. The food to me tastes like it comes out of a TV dinner, yet folks eat here and it stays open year after year so someone likes it."}
{"text":"Great authentic food. The cheap foam plates and plastic utensils leave much to be desired but staff is friendly and service is quick. If they had real plates and utensils it would be one of the best in the west valley. Red chili beef burrito is delicious"}
{"text":"Although I've never experienced it first hand, you always hear about the legendary Hispanic \"kitchens\" where you just drop in and for a small handful of dollars, they serve you meal of the day and it's always fantastic.  That's kind of what I envision when I think about La Loma Mexican Grille.
The Princess and I were invited to join a small gathering to attend Handel's Messiah concert in Litchfield Park and it would include dinner at the Hostesses favorite Mexican restaurant (she herself of Mexican descent).   Eight of us descended on the Grille to make sure we had enough sustenance to make it through a couple of hours of Holiday music.  We were not disappointed.
It's truly like going into someone's home. Very clean, the owners welcoming and gracious and the food is terrific.  Chip and Salsa come with the meal. I had the smothered \"hot\" burrito which was carne asada cooked with onions and jalapenos- excellent flavor!  Meal came with beans and rice which to my surprise were hot (temperature)-seems like the rice and beans at most Mexican restaurants are always half-cold.
The Princess had two tostados and they were monster sized!  Generous portions, very tasty, and well put together.  You can tell all of the ingredients are fresh here.
Yes, they serve on paper plates and plastic utensils-get over it as the food is well worth it.  This is genuinely another one of Phoenix's strip mall gems.  Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"The beans and rice are exactly the way I like them. The Pachanga was great! The green chile tamale and chicken taco were delicious!"}
{"text":"Fabulous Margaritas!! Food was authentic and delicious, prices are great! Fresh chips and salsa to start with, my meal was the 2 enchiladas,  served with rice, beans, fresh lettuce and tomatoes. ..yum-o! Who cares what your meal is served on when you feel like you just ate dinner at your aunt's house?!"}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch today. It's a few blocks from my house but if you don't know it's there you can't see it from the street. I'd had read the reviews from previous awesome yelpers and decided that we'd check it out and see if they really charged for extra chips after all the reviews. Gladly I can report that we were not charged for our extra bowl of chips while waiting for our lunch. So when you walk in the staff behind the bar will tell you to take a menu, decide on your items and bring them back to her to place order. I had the beef fajitas with rice and beans and a fountain drink that you serve yourself. Hubby had the Arturo combo. Price is about right for the city and what you'd expect while eating off paper plates and plastic forks. But it was enough food for both. The menu is basically anything you can find anywhere else so we can drive a couple of blocks down the street and have Filobertos. Without ripped seating or outdated decor. It's just a mom and pop shop for a quick bite. If you don't mind everything else. I think if we are across the street at FRYS or CVS right next door and it's lunch time we might go back. The lady at counter was very nice. I didn't check their alcohol options which is something that we like with Mexican cuisine so I'm not sure about that."}
{"text":"Great food.  Reminds me of home cooked New Mexican food (yes, there is a difference).  There is one male owner? who is very much creepy when he's there, but everything else is outstanding.  Very clean.  Homey feeling.  Friends and I recommend it to anyone looking for Mexican food in our direction."}
{"text":"This was my first time at La Loma today.  My friend and I stood there waiting because we didn't know we had to seat ourselves.  We finally realized it and then even had to go to the counter to get our menus where we discovered that is where you also place your order.  We sat down and looked over the menu.  Everything looked good.  I love chili rellenos, but I have a problem with the ones that are served omelet style as I feel you are too lazy to make them properly.  We did order and our food came in a decent amount of time.  The food was absolutely delicious.  I cleaned my plate.
The restaurant is spotlessly clean and so is the ladies' room.  The counter servers were friendly. I think the prices were okay, could be about a dollar cheaper on the entrees."}
{"text":"Great local, family-owned business.  We always receive a warm, friendly welcome and the food is dependable and yummy.  The breakfast burritos and carnitas are our favorites."}
{"text":"I've been anticipating a visit to La Loma Mexican Grille for a while now. It's one of the places my girlfriend and I enjoy grabbing some takeout from. She introduced me to La Loma a few years ago. And last night, while in the area, I finally had a chance to dine in (by myself) for a change.

Now let's put an end to the most common gripe I've read in a lot of the reviews for La Loma. I'm going to review the food, the service and the ambiance. Not the dishes! I've never read a single Yelp! review that praised the plates or flatware. Chinese take out shouldn't be punished for using paper boxes and food trucks don't get dinged for disposable plates. Chill out people!

Good food can be found on styrofoam plates with plastic utensils. And good service from the familiar faces behind the counter can be found in a simple but nicely decorated dining room. I ordered the fish tacos to try something different. Martha explained they were typically fried, but they were happy to grill them for me.

Dining in was a good choice because everything was fresh and hot. And for the first time in a while, I'm not going to complain about the Spanish rice. It was delicious! As were the semi-lumpy refried beans. Reminds me of how my mom made them. And the spicy crema on the tacos gave them a wonderful flavor! Note: A lot of people came and went with take out orders while I was there, and not one person complained about the styofoam boxes.

Minutes after I arrived at my girlfriends place, she expressed interest in ordering take out from La Loma. She didn't believe me when I told her I had just been there. Several minutes later, I was back at La Loma picking up her carnitas, which she enjoyed very much! Gracias La Loma!"}
{"text":"An old favorite 


La Loma Mexican Grill is tucked away in a small strip mall and has been there for as long as I have been in Arizona. The atmosphere at La Loma has  nice causual vibe and the staff is very friendly and accommodating. 

As you walk into La Loma you make your way to the front counter, view the menu, place your order, take a seat, and wait for your entr√©e to be delivered to your table.

 La Loma offers a good varied menu at reasonable prices. The only drawback is the plastic silverware and plates that your entr√©e is served on. However, I didn't mind  the styrofoam plates and plastic utensils after all its the food on the plate that matters not the plate it self.

The food at La Loma is fresh and tasty and my lunch companion and I enjoyed are meals.  Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Food bland, salsas bland, chips bland. Service needs to improve. not a full service restaurant. Place your order at the counter, then sit and wait. Everything is disposable...cups, utensils, plates, bowls, etc."}
{"text":"Fast service, really good food for the price, and super friendly staff. 

Hot Southwestern burrito with Carne Asada = YUM"}
{"text":"I like to try all little small business restaurants. This is not one that I would come back to. They don't take AMEX and post a sign that credit card fees hurt small business. No bad customer service and high prices hurt small business. They have ten dollar plus plates and the silverware and plates are plastic. We asked for more chips and never got any. They claim all dishes are homemade... I doubt it. 1 star review..."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love the place given we do not have very many mom and pop restaurants in the far west valley. Their were some highs and lows. 

Highs: comfortable setting
            Good salsa
            Good red chili in chimi
            Nice staff
            Great beans
            Great rice
            Good cheese crisp

Lows:  styrofoam everything (makes the sit down          
            Place look cheap, unnecessary, just odd),
            No credit card use for under $20, chips,  
            Up charge for many things and they mention 
            their reasoning throughout restaurant, 
            Prices a little high

As you read, the food was pretty good. The real issue to me is the business end of things for this little place. I say this in a constructive way and hope  they figure out how to run the business without making customers feel the negative impact. A customer should not feel uncomfortable asking for say extra chips and be worried they are going to be informed why they are being charged extra  for them. May give the place another try in the future."}
{"text":"A great little gem with perfect portion sizes, authentic Mexican fare, and incredible margaritas! We have been there on several occasions for lunch and most recently for dinner - they never disappoint! Friendly staff, and while you do have to go to the counter to order they  are very attentive to your needs and ensure that you have an enjoyable meal. The Styrofoam plates and plastic ware that others have complained about is petty - what matters is what's ON the plate! Delicious and authentic, worth every penny (it isn't expensive)."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Positives: 
I like the way this restaurant is set up. You walk up and order at the counter and pay. Then you take a seat like a normal eat in restaurant. 

I loved both the mild and hot salsa.  It was really yummy.  The chips were ok. The owner was very kind and I could tell she takes joy in her restaurant.  We enjoyed being there.  

Negatives:
There were 4 of us and we paid $67.  That is pretty expensive.  The food was a good portion but it still seemed high to us.  There was something about the red enchilada sauce that we didn't care for. I really wanted to love this place but given the price and taste, it wasn't our favorite

However if you're ok with the cost, you should give it a try and see what you think."}
{"text":"I read the reviews on Yelp and Nextdoor and thought we would give this place a try.  We went around 6:30 on a Friday night.  I was hoping that the wait wouldn't too long.  No worries as there were only three tables with people at them.  I don't have a problem ordering at the counter and I don't care about all the talk about the plates and utensils.  The food is what I came to eat because all the reviews said it was \"real Mexican\" and not \"white Mexican\".  I like the food at Arriba's so I thought I might like some \"real Mexican\".   Well we were both disappointed.  My carne asada with bean and cheese burrito was flavorless other than the hint of FISH I tasted.  I'm not a big fish fan.   My wife's loaded burrito was flavorless and the tortilla was very dry and had no flavor.  I am glad that some people like it but it isn't rave worthy.  Sorry, I can't recommend this place but I don't want to flame them as it appears to be family owned."}
{"text":"I appreciate the local/down home/authentic effort, but when chalupas cost $12 and are served on styrofoam everything, the desire to return is completely diminished. You eat here and 1) may not find much nutritional value to the food and 2) are filling a landfill with plastic foam."}
{"text":"Horrible food.Bad Service.Great location.Good for a beer or drink nothing more.The food is scary bad and disgusting to even look at.No flavor ,bland or dried out.YUCK!!
Dont plan on anything other than spending the night on the tiolet iafter you eat that food."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place off and on for over a decade.  The food is good, but it's really pricey.  Far too expensive for a place that uses plastic utensils.

Also, they give you about 5 tortilla chips.  For some reason they are very stingy with chips.  You can order multiple meals to go and you're given about a ziploc sandwich bag's worth of chips.  The small bag.

I'd give the place a higher rating if they had better prices and more chips."}
{"text":"Love it id drive from anywhere in the valley to eat it thx god I live down the street from it now"}
{"text":"Just that -- mehhh. Ordered fish tacos and got fish-flavored crunchy batter with no actual fish in it. Covered in tons of lettuce and cheese, as if to hide the lack of real fish. Pricey too. Cream sauce for the fish tacos was disgusting, and the lady behind the counter was a little miffed that I asked for the cream sauce on the side. All in all, I will not go there again, and won't recommend to anyone! I can make better Mexican food at home, and I'm not even Mexican!"}
{"text":"The food here is good but for what you get, in my opinion is a little too expensive. They also serve their food in paper/styrofoam plates. Makes this decent restaurant seem cheap. I'll go here again if someone really wants to, but will never go here just on a whim. Especially with so many other good Mexican establishments to eat at. Other places give you so much bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've ever had! Love the family that owns the restaurant. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"How are they in business?
Went here for lunch with coworkers. I ordered a taco salad which had all the ingredients listed on the menu.  Salad arrived at the table, consisted of very wet iceberg lettuce, soggy wet, with a few tiny bits of chicken. That's it. No tomatoes , onions, beans,cheese. Asked the server about the beans and they brought a small bowl of retried beans. For my salad, um no. 
Would have totally sent it back but seeing that we were on a work lunch we had limited time.
Oh and then two of us got food poisoning. 
And overpriced. What a joke of a restaurant ."}
{"text":"Keep in mind this establishment is a walk-up order. Chips were not warm enough for me hence not fresh, salsa is nothing to rave about. Tried their red tamale & shredded beef enchilada dinner & they were exceptionally good. The shredded beef is not dry its infused with gravy & very tasty. I give this establishment 4 stars, definitely be back to try their other entrees."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Mexican food place!!! My family has become regulars here because the amazing friendly service an FANTASTIC food! It is a little higher priced for cold chips, plastic silverware and disposable plates but you'll let that all go when you try the food"}
{"text":"Unordered the chicken chimichanga dinner and it's was delicious!! My husband ordered a carne asada burrito and it was super small.... he wasn't to happy with that... the guy that took our order was sweet though! I think I will drag him back with me next time we have to get pool supplies"}
{"text":"Prices were a little on the high side... extra chips were... well, \"extra\".  Salsa was mediocre.  The beans were decent and the rice OK but there was nothing that would bring us back for another try.  

The chilirelleno was simply an omelet with a canned or perhaps even pickled Anaheim chili in it.  I've had much better rellenos in less expensive restaurants.  The enchilada was mediocre with, what tasted like canned red sauce.  We were a party of four and no one was impressed with the food.  Fortunately we do not live in the area and we have better choices much closer to home."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant.  Love the carnitas!!  My wife loves the cheese enchiladas.  The beans are outstanding!  Great family restaurant!"}
{"text":"I've never stayed to eat here but always satisfied with my beef or chicken chimichanga. Others who have been here complained about the utensils/ plates being plastic/ paper, but I've been to Mexican restaurants where plates and utensils were all pretty but food wasn't all that. I recommend to others to try it out."}
{"text":"La Loma is hands down my favorite Mexican food restaurant in Arizona!  The enchilada's are addicting!  I could seriously eat here every day and there have been many weeks where I have eaten here 4 or 5 times! My advice is give it a try, I have taken many friends here and they have all been as pleased as I am with this place!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I have ever eaten ( have been coming here for 5 years) Today I tried something different and it was amazing.  I usually have their enchilada and tamale combo.  I forgot the name but it was a green chili pork burrito smothered in THE best sauce that had jalape√±o, onion, and tomotoe.  I never thought it would be that good.  Their salsa  is also my favorite,  I could drink it from a cup :) I recently tried another highly rated mexican place and it just didn't measure up.  The ladies here are also very sweet."}
