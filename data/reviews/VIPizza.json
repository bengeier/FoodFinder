{"text":"Best pizza in gaston county!! The atmosphere was great and the staff is super friendly. I highly recommend you try if you are a \"non chain\" pizza lover...."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times the food is excellent. I strongly recommend trying this place. Customer service is perfect. One of my pet peeves is the bathroom and they keep there bathrooms spotless. The restaurant is cleaned daly so if u want to try a warm welcoming place this is the spot for you."}
{"text":"Possibly the best pizza place in the Belmont area. Nice crust. They also have surprisingly good pasta."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! After being bummed about the previous occupant leaving for this place it was good to see another opened here! Had the large Supreme Pizza and it was the best! Even had canolis and it was excellent! Price and service spot on and restaurant was very clean and inviting!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza. Give this place a try!  Sauce and crust very good. We will definitely go to VIP on pizza nights."}
{"text":"I really debated writing this review.  The staff  that prepares the food are hard working and pleasant; no doubt about that.    The ingredients used at VIPizza are good; places that use lesser quality cheese and meats are a pet peeve of mine.    Another pet peeve of mine are restaurants that skimp on toppings when making salads, pizza's, etc., and that isn't the case here.  The waitstaff is a mixed bag; one server was neutral; one server was nice, and another server I didn't care for.  F   L   O   U   R  What?  Yes.  FLOUR!  In the three times that we've dined here, we've had variations of chicken picatta, marsala, etc.  The chicken portion was a little small; the pasta portion was huge.  The pasta...hmm...I don't know what's used.  The pasta tastes like a product made with white flour.  It's very overcooked - limp - and it's starchy.  Then add the sauce (e.g. marsala, etc.) into the mix, and wow!  Flour upon flour!  It's like a (close) variation of chicken and dumplings - literally.  I realize that the staff probably adjust their recipes to suit the local population, but this is too much.  Way too much.  The pizza is good, but not an NYC slice.  The pies are a bit small, but Vi's prices are in line with what they serve.  Wish they charged a dollar or two more, and made a standard sized 18\" pie.  The pizza isn't bad; the sauce and cheese are good, but in form...it's not a NYC pie.   Is that a bad thing?  No, because the pizza is pretty good.    So why'd I write this review?  I hate knocking a hard working business that doesn't overcharge their customers; that doesn't skimp on quality.  I don't expect Italian/Italian, and I am even a bit forgiving if it isn't American Italian - given that this is the South.    So...do I write the review or not?  Hopefully, this review might move management to consider tweaking their recipes a bit."}
{"text":"As a person who grow up on NYC Pizza I have to say this reminded me of Home. My family and I couldn't stop eating."}
{"text":"Best pizza around town! Pasta is good too. Friendly service and good prices. They deliver as well."}
{"text":"Awsome pizza place! I ordered a large pizza (pepperoni, beef, roasted red pepper and extra cheese) and I must say, its the best pizza ive had in quite a while. My girlfriend ordered the Manicotti and it was delicious! Along with that we also got an order of the mozzarella sticks and toasted ravioli, both were outstanding. I love marinara with a lot of spice(not hot spice) and theirs is delicious, not bland like most of the places around me. True NY style pizza, which is expected considering the owner is from NY and the restaurant started in NY. I wouldve taken pictures to post but the family devoured it before I could"}
{"text":"If you are looking for good pizza this is definitely the place. They use fresh ingredients . And an added Plus our waitress was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and the staff is always great. This is one of my favorite hidden gems in Gaston county!"}
{"text":"We ordered the supreme pizza.  It was good and i liked the crust.  I would suggest waiting 5 minutes for the cheese to settle in."}
{"text":"Ordered here because Sal's wasn't delivering, Will order from here for now on. Chicken piccata is very good and generous portion size for cost."}
{"text":"Thanks VIPizza.   Called and ordered food for twenty people. Pizza and salads.  Everything was ready on time.  All the pizzas were hot and the salads were ready to go.  Everybody loved the food. Commenting this is the best pizza I've had since I left NY.    VIPizza is awesome."}
{"text":"I got a couple of pizzas there last night and they were great! Good sauce, good crust, the hallmarks of a good pizza joint. Check em out, a great addition to Cramerton!"}
