{"text":"Went back to get treats for friends. 

The macrons were great! The outside crisp, but inside nice and chewy with a great assortment of flavors. I ended up with the chocolate banana, and even not being a banana fan, I found it to be quite good. 

I also had a bostock which was quite good. Crisp, satisfying and something you won't find just anywhere."}
{"text":"What a little gem!

Ordered the Sandwich & Drink special for only $7.05! 

The servers were friendly and helpful. Some of the baguettes are pre-made with butter (which I can't have for lactose). But the server offered to make me one fresh with mayonnaise instead! 

I had the Prosciutto and Pickle - bread was light and fresh but had that good French chew to it. Meat and pickle complemented each other perfectly.

Nice and chill vibe. I'd come back."}
{"text":"We've been to many different bakeries and theirs is very authentic. I've been to France four times and they offer the same beautiful and delicious pastries you'd find there for a reasonable price. 

We've tried several things there since they've opened. My family loves the butter and almond croissants. My husband and I love the pan au chocolate. Ah-mazing! This past time we tried the Black Forrest Cake, which was good. We loved the cherry inside. We had a little chocolate flourless cake too, which was also very good. The little bag of Madeleines were good too. Macarons are always good. We try different types every time we go. It's fun to try new flavors. There are so many different pastries to try. 

Go check it out if you want to try different types of authentic French pastries. It's exciting they have so many different locations across town. Can't wait to try the one downtown. We love visiting the Lawrenceville location."}
{"text":"This is their newest location in downtown Pittsburgh on Forbes across from the Tower at PNC.  There are about 10 tiny tables in this tiny location, but enough for people that want lunch and want to sit.  I came in around 12:30 on a Wednesday and there were still empty seats.  The counter was laden with spectacular looking pastries and breads.  I wanted to grab something to bring back to the office and share, so I had them put in a variety of macarons and these little tiny cakes that I was told were pistachio and raspberry. 

The little cakes were amazing.  The macarons are perfectly flavored and very buttery.  For 5 of each, the total came to less than 8 bucks which is pretty incredible for this place.  

I definitely want to come back and try the he macarons.  Bluebird Kitchen down the street has some of the best, so La Gourmandine has some competition in the area, but it's a welcome addition to the downtown food landscape."}
{"text":"I almost don't want to keep this to myself, but...La Gourmandine is downtown! Read that with a Kermit flailing arms voice, because I am *that* excited about it.  I do like a certain other regional chain bakery with the French name just fine too, but nothing beats the realer deal, La Gourmandine. It's located just across from the PNC Tower and is stacked with all my delicious familiar favorites that I usually get in the Lawrenceville location, but with the key difference that it's spacious and has seating for dining in. Which I haven't done yet, but will strongly consider for lunch in the future.  For now, I use La Gourmandine as motivation to get out of bed on cold mornings and come downtown instead of working from home in my pjs, haha.  I used to get my once-in-awhile-treat of almond croissants from the Gaby & Jules counter in Market Street Grocery, but even though they are closer to my office, I will be getting them from here because the former can't be bothered to deliver their baked goodies downtown before 8:30 am. The staff is very friendly and fast and is great about explaining what each pastry is, and is quick to tell you what to get in the morning before it sells out for the day."}
{"text":"I have heard so many good things about La Gourmandine since they opened their downtown location. 

I went for lunch and got the prosciutto and pickle sandwich. The bread was amazing and the prosciutto and little pickles paired perfectly. I felt like the sandwich was missing something, as that's all that was on it; a whole grain mustard would have been a nice addition to offer. My friend and I wished they offered a 1/2 sandwich and soup combo.. Soup sounded good but not with a full sandwich already, nor for an extra $5. I realize they're new and might offer something like that down the road.

I got an almond croissant to share which was AMAZING! And then afterwards, I tried the salted caramel Macaron and loved that too.

Everything tasted so fresh; I plan to frequent this spot for lunch often."}
{"text":"Yaaaasssss! I'm so glad this opened in town because I NEVER make it to Lawrenceville on the weekend early enough before they sell out. Came In for some lunch. My coworker and I split the ham and Swiss sandwich and the prosciutto and pickles sandwich. Both were great! The little bit of butter on them just makes them so simple but SO good. We also split a croissant and I had this chocolate lava cake (prob not what it was called but it was DELICIOUS). 

The staff were all very pleasant and nice. 

My reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is the set of refrigerators that have REALLY heavy slamming doors and are close to some of the seating (where we were seated) every time they were opened,which was a lot because they were restocking, the slamming noise just was so loud. Prob wouldn't even mention it if it wasn't a Bakery/coffee shop that has more of a quaint and quiet feel."}
{"text":"Had to try a little bit of everything and nothing disappointed. The almond croissant is one of the best I've ever had. I loved the softness in the middle and crunch on the ends. The salted caramel macaron was divine -- without question one of the best I've had, too. Will be back on my next trip to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"La Gourmandine is an absolute treasure, and I'm so glad they have a downtown location now. Their almond croissant is the best I've ever had, and their coffee and espresso drinks are great as well. Everything is extremely decently priced, there's free wifi and nice seating, and the people working here are super nice and friendly. Couldn't ask for more!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have loved everything. The croissant is huge and flaky. I got some pastry with apricot that was amazing (don't remember what it's called). And the macarons....amazing. I ate 6 in one setting. The raspberry are my favorite. They open at 7:30am which is perfect for when I get to work early and want to get something for breakfast. They are quick, knowledgeable, and give great service. Plus, it's super cute inside!"}
{"text":"La Gourmadine is one of the best French bakeries in the city and I was thrilled to have the opportunity to visit it downtown now located where the Penn Ave fish market was previously housed.

This is the 4th location of this established business with the other 3 located in Lawrenceville, Mt Lebanon, and Hazelwood. The menu is identical to the other three with coffee and expresso drinks available.

My favorite pastry is their famed almond covered danish but haven just ate decided to settle for a couple of their macaroons. One was chocolate banana flavored and the other was strawberry. Believe me, it did not disappoint and with the flaky crust literally tore apart as I ate it. So good!!

This location is extremely small but they have a gender neutral restroom. Free WiFi is available. Passcode is on one of their chalkboards. They have a small seating area which I have found to be true in their other locations as well.

Want lunch? Yes, they still have their hoagie style sandwiches you would find at the other locations. They also have a daily quiche. The only major difference is that this location gets most of their products from the Hazelwood location. Few items are made in house. Prices have gone up slightly but still very reasonable for the quality of food you get here.

Take out as always is available. I did chat with one of the counter persons who waited on me because I wanted to find out why the are only open on weekdays. Basically this location caters to the working since their hours pretty much match working hours. They are closed Sat and Sun. He did tell me that they had recently opened and may consider expanding into weekends if there is enough draw.

It is my hope that they do. I normally don't go to town during the week unless absolutely necessary and this would be a great spot to get a great sandwich or if you are daring one of their French gourmet breakfast pastries. Refrigerated items are also available along with some breads.

Located on Forbes Ave near Cardamone's beauty parlor there is construction on that side of Forbes if you are headed down from Smithfield St."}
{"text":"This was a great little breakfast place. The coffee was delicious and those pastries were amazing! I had the latte and the quiche (with bacon). The pastry was flaky and the quiche was very flavorful. I would love to come eat lunch here the sandwiches were made fresh daily and they also have soups."}
