{"text":"This is a really nice space that is in a neighbourhood that definitely needs more restaurant love.  My friend and I went in early (6pm) on a Thursday, and were seated immediately.  It did get quite busy later though.  The interior is lovely and cosy, with lots of large, spacious booths.  We were kid- free that day, but it seemed like it would be a great place for families.    The vibe is fantastic -  classy but laid back, with super friendly service.  Even though it was quite busy when we left, we were not rushed out at all (we were still ordering drinks well after our food was finished).  

We shared the olive tray to start and it was really tasty and served warm.  We followed this with wood-oven pizza, which was GREAT.  They also had lots of pasta options on the menu, and unlike some other places, they aren't fussy about people making substitutions on the pizza toppings.    Prices were moderate and completely fair for the level of quality and service.  I will most definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I give this a marginal pass. 

The pizza was limp, the edge of the crust too big, but the dough is a marginal pass. Still better than a Pizza Pizza or Pizza Nova, but it's just alright for a specialty pizza restaurant. 

The seafood pasta was perfect portion, with the calamari being perfect, but the spaghetti could have been al denti, and less drenched in oil. 

We were there on a less busy evening, but the one server working definitely needed help. My question is; why didn't (seems like) the owner didn't help out. Service was slow and could have been better."}
{"text":"I find this place very expensive and the food is mediocre. I bought a glass of wine, it was very expensive and they gave you very little. For a restaurant that is not in the downtown core, and on an industrial street, they could do better with the pricing and food quality."}
{"text":"Great salads, beet and arugula salad are the best imo.  The clam pizza is a little weird but the rest are winners."}
{"text":"I wish that I could give a better review because the food is good and it is right down the street from where I live but after many disappointments, I cannot recommend this spot with a good conscience.

The management is absolutely horrid.  On our first visit, the manager asked us to sit at the bar to wait for a table- in a completely empty restaurant.  We waited and were seated about 5 minutes later.  Once seated, the manager micromanaged our server- cutting her off, getting in the way of us ordering, and contradicting her.  I felt terrible as she was doing a great job with our service. Despite the management issues, the food was good so we returned.  

The next few visits were similar to the first- the manager lacks complete social skills and should not be in the front of house.  It would probably benefit the restaurant to have her stay away from the tables and patrons.  Nonetheless, we loved the food and just attempted to steer clear of her.

The last straw was the purchase of our Groupon.  After attempting to make an email reservation, we received a reply email simply asking, \"If we had a Groupon\".   When I answered \"Yes\", we were told that we would not be able to redeem the deal but could use the value at the restaurant at some other time.  Ha!  I responded with a none to pleased email to which I received some sob story from the manager stating that she was the owner and sole operator due to a \"series of unfortunate events\".  Instead of offering some other compromise, I was told not to be so harsh and judgmental.

I don't believe that I was being harsh at all by simply trying to redeem our Groupon by getting a table for two in the imminent future.  

Bottom line: 1) Do not sell Groupons that you can't fulfill, 2) Work WITH your customers to come up with a solution, 3) Hire a social appropriate manager so that you are able to RETAIN those that have been good to you.

Future potential customers: I would not suggest buying any deals that come from this place and at best, only do takeout.

I personally, will never be back and even asked Groupon for a refund. So sad."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been 6 or 7 times.  We prefer this place over Libretto which is also nearby. 

The oven baked olives are delicious.  The beet salad is to die for.  They have Mill St in tap (even the more obscure ones like curious parrot)

The only entrees we have tried are the pizzas and we love them. I usually switch between the Margherita and the Capo.  Spicy honey on a pizza is amazing."}
{"text":"Pizza was very good, maybe a bit thicker crust than I prefer but otherwise great flavour.  Service was nice though perhaps a touch slow. The place always seems busy though and has a nice ambiance without seeming too loud (I love Libretto's pizza but it is way too loud for comfortable conversations)."}
{"text":"During my first experience at Picea 997, the food was excellent and our server was good. 

So, why only two stars? It's their appalling reservation system, or lack of one. We tried calling and got an answering system saying \"please leave a message with details of your reservation request.\" No one called back. 

We called again and someone answered, saying \"we only accept reservations by EMAIL.\" Funny, their voicemail does not indicate that, and their website notes a phone number to call \"for reservations.\" Well, we tried emailing (two days in a row) and didn't receive a response either time. 

Bad, bad customer service. Shape up Picea!"}
{"text":"We wanted to like it, we really did! It's our 'hood, open Sunday nights, we've passed it for a year and finally got to try. We were seated even though we didn't have reservations so a good start. No bread brought to the table at any point. We ordered apps: bread w/melted mozzarella on a rosemary stick looked good; cheese wasn't melted. at all bread wasn't toasted. Grilled polenta: too thick but ok. Beet salad: very good, whew! Greens and beans: way too spicy. Couldn't finish it because chili overwhelmed everything. Now the mains: I ordered 2 salads, the kale salad dressing was cloyingly sweet and the brussel sprout salad was a tower with candied pecans (which the kale salad also had) and a mustard dressing that tasted only of mustard. My companions liked their pizzas though though my son wondered about the quality of the cheese on his. Everything took forever to arrive. Our pizzas stood on the counter while we wondered who might bring them until we simply asked the waitress if she could bring them before they got any colder. Our warm molten chocolate cake was glumpy and gluey and not served warm; it was missing the \"artisanal hazelnut sorbet\" and when we asked, our waitress came back with a bowl of strawberry ice cream with no explanation; not even nicely scooped. The table next door also inquired about their missing sorbet and by the time we left they still hadn't even gotten a strawberry ice cream bowl.

The owner Kris is charming and she really tried hard. She even removed the dessert from our bill when we explained about the sorbet disappointment. We have kids in the restaurant industry and we really understand the glitches a restaurant can go through. It was our server's first week and she was pretty \"green\", but we were patient. This place has so much potential: a charming exposed brick interior, nicely decorated, a warm neighborhood feel. If it \"pumped up\" its menu and added some soup, some non-pizza mains (a meat dish, a fish du jour) and watched the cook's tendency to over-spice, it could improve. The pizzas are their strong point and they are imaginative and good. We'd like to come back in the summer and see if they have worked out the glitches."}
{"text":"zero consistency in the food.  one visit it will be great, the next visit it will be terrible.  you could order the same pizza and get a different looking one every time.  also, it has been closed for several weeks with no notice on the door, website or voicemail.  is this place even still in business??"}
{"text":"This is the third or so time we've done Picea997. As others say, great addition to the 'hood.

However: we were seated at very tiny, uncomfortable table at the back, right by the kitchen and the stairway to the washrooms. Throughout our meal, we spent most of the night listening to the kitchen staff, management, and service staff talking as they hovered around us. Like, really guys: no one wants to sit there and spend 100 dollars on a meal. It's insulting.

The food is fine, but really we just wanted to leave the entire time we were there. Go to Pizza Libretto, wait the 60 min or whatever for a table, and have better pizza with amazing service and atmosphere at the same price."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the hood.  The food was excellent although the menu was pretty limited.  I was bummed they didn't have their liquor license as I like to start dinner with a cocktail.
We will go back for sure and bring the kids next time!"}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to the neighbourhood. We tried the spicy pizza, the meatball, and beet salad. All were really good and we will definitely be coming back to try the other items on the menu.  Decor is normal, nothing trendy, a little bit like a chain restaurant but the music certainly made up for it - unexpected pleasant surprise - they were playing britpop - I heard Elastica, and James, maybe even Suede. Will certainly be back there soon."}
{"text":"Picea is a cute neighbourhood restaurant with friendly staff and good food, not great, but fine. Food prices are average for a nice restaurant but the wine list is ridiculous. If I remember correctly the cheapest bottle of wine was $40.00 or $45.00!! Seems to me prices should reflect the restaurant - so, not an upscale trendy spot, but a good neighbourhood place nicely decorated with good food. These days it's so easy to get good reasonably priced wine, both red and white, around the $10.00 - $12.00 price range (and even cheaper) so there is no excuse for not having at least one bottle of something in the low to mid twenty dollar range. 

The restaurant business is a tough competitive business, better to not alienate your customers by trying to put on airs!"}
{"text":"Soggy pizza and very slow service.  The place was full and it looked like there was one gentleman working the pizza oven.  Would not go back.  Pizza would have been great if it wasn't soggy because the flavours were wonderful.  Unfortunately our waitress also had a bit of an attitude."}
{"text":"My review is based on 6-8 visits. The service here is inconsistent but tends to be poor more often than good. Do not arrive when you are very hungry. Kitchen staff can be seen working on food prep when salads (food that doesn't need cooking) have yet to be served. Food tends to take a long time even when there are less than 3 tables in the place. My most recent experience was so bad I've decided to never return considering there are so many alternatives in toronto. My friend and I came here for dinner after work. Another couple was seated next to us. Their apps came before ours while we had arrived and ordered at least 15 minutes before them. The server tried to explain that this was because one of our apps takes a long time in the oven and she had ASSumed we wanted our apps to come out all at once. This didn't explain why their pizzas arrived 10 minutes+ before ours. I ordered a vegetarian lasagna (daily special) for take out. This was the worst issue of all. I asked if they had vegetarian lasagna because the menu showed beef lasagna. The server confirmed they do. My vegetarian daughter took a bite to find out that they gave us meat by mistake. Inexcusable mistake!!!"}
{"text":"We'd come back here for the pizza, and perhaps the Italian chopped salad.  Cool setting.

Caesar salad - plain, boring.  Not bad, but below expectation.
Italian chopped salad - good, I'd eat this again.

Vesuvius pizza - arugula & prosciutto pizza, good crust.  The crust was thin, but fluffy.  Hard to do.

Rigatoni pasta - For a mixed meat pasta, far below expectation.

If/when we go again, we'd just get the pizza and 2 appetizers."}
{"text":"We went in on a Thursday evening around 7pm...  only a few tables taken but alot of activity with take out.  The place is very comfortable and welcoming and the reno job is great.. the service was great.  We specifically went to sample the pizza and have a couple of beers.  The flavors were tasty... tried the Margherita (had to!!) and one of the specials of the day...  very good and better that its just a short walk away.  Would like to see a couple of more items on the menu....."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon deal to try out this restaurant with some girlfriends of mine. I made a reservation almost a month in advance and had mentioned I would be using the Groupons I had purchased. Fast forward to a few days before the reservation and I received a message saying \"fyi you can only use one Groupon at a time\". I replied, expressing my confusion seeing as I don't see the difference of using 2 groupons at a table of 4 people or using them for 2 tables of 2 people, and asked if someone could kindly call me. I received no call and when I tried to call the restaurant noone picked up. As a result, I assumed that I would not have any trouble.

What I arrived to was an extremely passive aggressive woman who refused to honour both Groupons I purchased. We are all residents in the area who were excited to try a new place and based on this experience none of us will be returning to this establishment. 

The restaurant was also empty (which is never a good indication) so I would imagine most business owners would put aside nonsensical 'fine print' in order to welcome more guests into their restaurant. Because at the end of the day, both parties are still receiving the same deal.

I NEVER usually feel strongly enough to write reviews online but I felt this one was a special circumstance. I rarely run into situations where I'm met with such incredibly poor customer service.

Needless to say, I will never be returning to Picea997 and will not be recommending it to ANY of my friends."}
{"text":"The first time I went to PICEA997, I took a chance and took a date. Luckily, my bet that the place would be good was more than justified.

It's a nice restaurant, well-renovated with a nice ambiance and good service. The food is excellent, some of the best pizza I've had. I was sad to run out of leftovers."}
{"text":"My father and I went to Picea997 last week. I got the distinct impression that the restaurant may not be doing the business they could be. My father ordered a dinner sized Caesar salad and a bowl of soup. The salad was served on a side plate and was really small given the $10 price tag. The soup was overpriced and again the portion was small. When you opened the menu, there were a number of items crossed off in pen with a written message that they are sold out of these choices.The menu is permanent. I noticed the wine pour was very small and the coffee is $3 a cup. The pizza was good. The ony complaint would be that the crust could be thinner. But, $17 for a personal pizza? When we asked about dessert, we were told that the only thing they had -eventhough the menu offers a number of choices- was gelato. I think the $70 price tag for pizza, soup and salad; albeit with one glass of wine each was harder to digest thatn the food. There were only 2 other tables in the restaurant that were patronized. I won't be going back here."}
{"text":"Have driven past Picea997 a number of times and always said 'need to come by..soon\"... soon came yesterday. 

The place is very comfortable, loved the colors, being able to see the pizza oven as soon as you come in, the bar to the left... very nice! Five stars for the great reno. 
The food was good, with a a couple of buts to share here:

1. The cold cuts/cheese/warm olives dish was good, the olives were 'amazing' really, the meat and cheese hit the spot with me.
BUT the crostinis (2) were a disappointment. 
Sorry guys! this appetizer was so amazing...until I took the first bite of the 'crostini' (cold - like it got just pulled from the fridge, it was chewy, and only two pieces - for the amount on cold meats and cheese, two crostini pieces were not enough). 
The warm olives get 5 Stars though!!! 
I will try this appetizer again and hope the 'crostini' is crunchy, or warm, or simply better.

2. The arugula salad with the lemon dressing was a success with me. Loved it! 
Right size, right flavor. Will have it again. 
3. The pizza (Margarita): Always try this pizza as my first test....well....  LOVED IT!!!
The crust was perfect for me, the edges were done just right, it was light on the cheese side (my preference) and the best part... the sauce, OMG!!!! Not too much, not too little, it was just right. 
BUT (yes another but), it didn't have enough fresh basil leaves for my liking.  Will try it again and see if it has been improved.

Kept looking around and all the plates other tables were having. Definitively need to go back and try: the meat ball, the eggplant, the daily soup, other pizza's....and need to leave some space for dessert.

The service was great, friendly and we were served promptly. 

I was leaning towards a Four Star here, but I can't ...... I will need to give this place a try again."}
{"text":"Doesn't even deserve the one star.

I don't generally give bad review's, but my experience here was inexcusable.

Service was horrible, with a forced smile from the waitress only when giving us the bill. Waited on table bread for 1 hour, but it never came. Restaurant wasn't busy at all, but our appetizers took 75 minutes to come out. Followed by two flavorless pies with the least amount of toppings possible, even for a Neapolitan style pizza.

Save your money, and stick to the pizzerias that do it best in this city. Queen Margarita, Pizzeria Libretto, etc.."}
{"text":"First let me say, my experience over all here was an absolute 5 star. 

~The food ~
Oh my gosh, where to start? We ordered the eggplant bake (not sure its name) and cesar salad to start, followed by a couple of beers. Cesar salad was amazing, but small . .The beer was light and crisp just how I like it. 

For our main dish he ordered the brocollini pizza and I the spaghetti with clams.  He said the pizza wasn't anything special (but then again he eats pizza from all over Toronto about 2-3 times a week. It's crazy!) I thought it was very bland, I have made better pizza's myself from scratch. Broccolini was a good idea though! I thought the pasta was a little over done, but for once a perfect portion size. I ATE EVERY BITE! :D

The reason why I am giving this restaurant a 4 star rating is due to the flavours/quality of the main dishes. Usually they are outstanding when you go to a pricier place for a meal however this restaurant (which I'm assuming is new) needs to put a little more love into their mains. 

After they placed down the main dishes we got our own bottle to use of freshly made olive oil. I LOVED their home made olive oil! It was delicious and tasted magnificent on the crust of the pizza we had ordered. Some dishes they were carrying out from the kitchen were massive in size! Exciting!! 

For dessert we split the nutella brownie. It was to die for. I wish we got our own! 

~The Service~
There were only two women serving the whole restaurant that night. Both were super nice and not overly fake! (lol I hate when servers try so hard and are super fake-happy-over the top energetic) Food came quickly with no delay and hardly any wait time. The waitresses were knowledgeable, helpful and polite. 

~The Atmosphere~
Very romantic, sensual, dim lit atmosphere. Perfect for a couple to go for date night

~Overall~
Quaint little restaurant I would advise anyone to go for a quiet evening with someone they love.

~Prices~
Our bill was about $100.00 which isn't too bad for a restaurant of this calibur for two people!"}
{"text":"Went on a groupon. Had no problem redeeming it even though they didn't have my reservation (which is required with the groupon). The place was empty so I had no issues with the service which was basic but friendly. The pizza was decent. The dough slightly thick and under seasoned. Definitely JUST missed the authenticity vote.  Wasn't worth $12-18 dollars we paid for each pizza."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times since they opened. They do a great thin-crust pizza, which is the obvious thing you'd look for, and have some other nice stuff as well. Last time I was there, I had the \"white salad\" to start (pears, endive, fennel), which was lovely and an unexpected mix of flavours, and a chestnut ravioli which was incredible, if a bit oily. Usually I get the beet salad, which is also great.

Service can be a bit up-and-down, we've had great service and mediocre service. You never which you're going to get, really. But overall, it's a great (and much-needed) addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"SOGGY BOTTOM PIZZA!  

Our experience at Picea997 was so bad that I felt compelled to write my first Yelp review.  There is no way we would have gone here a second time, but there was a mess up with Groupon purchases so this was our second poor experience.

Our $10 ceaser salad was served on  a tiny plate and while tasty was only lettuce and parmesan flakes - no croutons or bacon.  Their menu was minimalist and we had already exhausted all the appetizers from out first excursion.  They are all meh! worthy and overpriced.

We all ordered pizzas as the pasta we got last time was also a very small portion and not very good.  When we lifted the pizza to our mouth the slice would droop down - every slice was soggy!  Our bill came to over $110 for 4 and that is with a $55 groupon.  Yikes!  we could have gone to Big Slice on St Clair and got more food for $40!"}
{"text":"I live within a walking distance to Picea and through my purchase of Groupon voucher, it gave me a really good excuse to check it out.

I went with a friend on a Sunday night and made a reservation for 8pm.  When I arrived, I mentioned my reservation at 8 and the server told me that they don't actually \"reserve\" tables.  Groupon deal mentioned reservation is required however, so I thought this was contradictory.  Luckily we didn't have to wait long and was seated.  Our server was friendly and courteous, and she was prompt.  We got two appitzers, eggplant rollatini, and it was really good.  We also got Meatball, and it was average.  The pizza was pretty good, nothing out of this world, but decent enough that I can see myself going there next time I crave pizza within my neighbor.  Pizza is priced at a decent price, while I think appetizer was a bit too expensive for what you get.
Overall, it's a nice addition to this area where it's lacking in decent restaurants.  Their atmosphere is also pretty nice."}
{"text":"I noticed this new restaurant pop up in the neighborhood and bonus a groupon was offered for it.  I purchased the group on as an added incentive to try this new place.  The stipulation of the group on being that it could only be used sun-thur no other exclusions included.  

I made a reservation for next Thursday for dinner.  It happens to be Valentines Day.  When I made the reservation I mentioned the groupon and no issue was made of it.  I received a call the next day saying they would not except the groupon as it was Valentines Day.  I mentioned the fact that there were no dates stipulated as excluded. They reaffirmed they would not except it.

I don't much care for restaurants that don't honour their promotions."}
{"text":"Date night. We ate @ Picea977 last night.  Everything was fresh and well-made.

The service was very good, helpful and friendly.

The salads were delicious.  I had the beet salad and he had the arugula.  

And yes, the pizza did take a while, but we preferred the atmosphere to Libretto or Terroni's where I feel like people are looking over my shoulder to see if I'm almost finished ready to take in more customers."}
{"text":"Price 3/5 - $14-18 per one person pizza

Location 3/5 - kind of central kind of not. no parking. nearest parking a block away

Food 4/5 - good pizza, limited choice of beer (3 to 5)

Will NOT be back"}
{"text":"If you don't love large novelty meatballs, there is obviously something deeply wrong with you.

Picea is just another magnificent surprise popping up in my new neighbourhood. The wood-fired pizza is fired up (for the dance, thanks Rankins), and they have all of the things you love from Libretto at half the price. The wine list is tiny, but it isn't marked up to break your bank. Ideal. 

I had their special which was a 4 cheese pizza with a mushroom gravy instead of tomato sauce with an arugula topper. If it's on the menu when you're there, be sure to check it out. 

Most importantly. And this gets it's own paragraph. They serve more than just pizza. Amen. 

PEPPER POINTS: For non stop booths. So comfy. Gratzie."}
