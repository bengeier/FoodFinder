{"text":"I've been coming here for about 8 years even though it's probably been around for much longer.  You can't tell given that the sign says \"Grand Opening 3 for $1\" and it's been there as long as I have been patronizing this place.  It's called Chinese Bakery and it's run by the same gruff Vietnamese girls that have been serving me for all 8 years.  It used to be one of the few who made the milk egg tarts (as opposed to the traditional yellow ones) so it kept me coming back.  It's a money printing operation cos they're always busy (though I've noticed they haven't been as busy as in the past... perhaps the competition is finally getting to them??).  Well, in Chinatown, it really doesn't matter cos if they close, another one pops up and it's like they've made their money so they don't care.

Service rating is crappy... like a 1-2 star as they treat you worse than just a number and they've even ripped me off cos they can't add so make sure you know how much you've bought.  Their prices have climbed over the years and it seems like the size of the pastries have gotten smaller.  The only reason I'm still coming here is because it's the closest one to the east where I live and I need to pass through the war zone to get to the others.  In the winter, I'd rather not but if the weather is not too hot or cold, I'm willing to venture to a few of the other places to get my pastries.  Overall, the quality is a 4 star for their buns, butterfly cookies, cakes and pastries but the sizes are smaller now, prices gone up and service is not so good so it's a 3 star and dropping.  Keep your calculator handy and your eyes open for new bakeries."}
{"text":"Food is not mind blowing but satisfying and tasty, with the overall price making it 4 stars. Mashion and dingdong on spadina are fair competition but I like this Chinese bakery because it is the closer one to me when I am downtown. Got 2 xiaobaos and a box full of miscellaneous pastries for less than $5, what more could you want. Make sure you take advantage of their buy 2 for $1 pastries - my fave is the glutinous fried pork dumpling. Love coming here on a Saturday morning as it's not only made fresh and served warm but very much reminds me of my childhood! If you are looking for something healthy to snack on, obviously you will not find it at this Chinese bakery or any Chinese bakery to begin with. My only qualm is the triangle pastries filled with chasiu /curry have too much pastry to filling ratio. I wouldn't get those.

For special event orders like cakes I would maybe go to mashion, but I don't really like Chinese cakes anymore and haven't tried theirs so I can't say for sure. They just seem to specialize in those more."}
{"text":"Egg tarts - 4 stars
Coconut tarts - 4 stars
Milk egg tarts - 4 stars
BBQ pork buns - 3 stars"}
{"text":"A neighborhood hangout on a Wednesday afternoon. Cheap sweets, awesome steamed pork buns. Did I say cheap? Although we didn't try the cheesecake it was only $3.50 and no hour-long line up ;)"}
{"text":"Super tasty and cheap, will return if possible when I visit Toronto again!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's one of my favourite spots for cheap eats in the city. 

In my opinion the BBQ pork buns, curry buns, and deserts stack up with any other bakery in Chinatown. This combined with the price is what has kept me coming back here for years. 

You can literally stuff yourself, and have enough leftover for another meal or two, for under $5. Amazing."}
{"text":"I always remember this bakery by the Dragon on the sign. 

The buns are tasty, and cakes are beautiful. The 3 for $1 is a steal. Plus they have a few other things the Spadina bakeries don't have."}
{"text":"sure, its pretty cheap... but compare to some other bakeries in Chinatown... the its not that tasty for some reason :-("}
{"text":"You're not gonna find cheaper Chinese pastries downtown. Quality is sub-par but if you're looking for a cheap and fast bite, you can probably get a meal here for less than $4. Cash only."}
{"text":"I learned the hard way that not even Chinatown is awake before 9am on a Sunday morning.  My mission was to find fresh egg tarts, and it was a difficult task at this hour!  

I ended up having enough time to comparison shop all the Chinese bakeries (if they were open) along a stretch of Dundas (between Spadina and Beverley) and a stretch of Spadina (between Baldwin and Dundas).  It turns out the first stop, Chinese Bakery, had the best prices of all the shops open at this hour.  Unfortunately, their egg tarts wouldn't be ready for another hour, so instead I got barbecue pork buns, curry buns and sesame balls, all priced at 2 for $1!  The competition was priced anywhere from 70 cents to $1 each and their pastries weren't as big as those at Chinese Bakery.  I also got several glutinous rice balls (my favourite) at 3 for $1.  The competition was selling these for 60 or 70 cents each!  

I buckled under the pressure at the counter and got a couple of bags of their day-old stuff (a whole bag for $1.50) and was impressed to find these products tasted just as fresh as the new stuff!  I tried (at least) one of everything and loved them all.  Tip: warm your buns or sesame balls a little before consuming.  They taste they like they just came out of the oven!

I recommend buying anything you want quickly as your favourites may sell out fast.  On my first visit when I was just window shopping, they had loads of bbq pork buns.  When I returned, however, they were down to only 2.  

The only problem with Chinese Bakery is that it's difficult to communicate with the staff.  I used my Cantonese with the lady at the counter, but she could only respond to me in Mandarin - which, unfortunately, I don't understand.

I'm sure you won't get too far if you ask for directions to the \"Chinese Bakery\" in Chinatown.  If it helps, in Chinese, Chinese Bakery's sign translates to \"Big Dragon Phoenix Bakery\".  Otherwise, just look for the big yellow sign (see picture)."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on our way through Chinatown. 

The good: Great value. We bought 3 pork buns, 2 sesame seed buns, and 3 egg custard tarts, which came out to $4. Everything looked fairly fresh (for 4pm) and the place was packed. There's a microwave to self reheat anything you want warmed up.

The meh: I've had better tasting buns, but for the price, I can't complain much. The bakery name isn't the most original, but it is easy to remember.

Would I come here again? Yes. Filling and cheap snacks for the traveler on the way to their next destination."}
{"text":"I came here on a whim in a recent trip to Toronto. I was super excited to see all of their bao options and loaded up. I found their prices to be extremely reasonable.

Once I got back to my hotel and tried them I was pretty unimpressed. The meat ones in particular were especially bad. Some of the sweeter ones were better but none were really great. I would try a different bakery next time I was in town. If I could I would have left them 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"The food is cheap. :D  I grabbed a steamed pork bun on my way to the art museum. The pork and veggies were still steamy. It was a convenient snack and cheap to boot!  It was only .70 cents. mmmm very nice. On my way leaving Toronto I bought a cheesecake that was like a sponge cake for maybe $3.00. I a used coconut butter as a topping. Delish! The service was friendly, they have seating available. I would like to try more things, but I merely passing through. Their operating hours are 8am-8pm."}
{"text":"I've said it before and I'll say it again- you cannot beat china town prices for the amount of food you get. The main woman who runs this store is amazing and very sweet and friendly. Great hours and super conveniently located along dundas accessible both by dundas streetcar or Spadina streetcar and short walk. I'm a regular here and will continue to be. The deals are crazy good and I love the pork buns here. 3 for two dollars- what? Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"When I'm anywhere near downtown Toronto, what to get for lunch is a no-brainer. Forget the brisk, harsh service of the sit-down places - go for Chinese pastries!

For a few dollars apiece, a friend and I hunkered down in here, seating ourselves at one of the few tables at the storefront with an assortment of food in front of us. Some of the things we tried:

- meat steamed buns
- triangular curry pastries
- peanut rice balls
- black bean rice balls
- deep fried meat things
- taro pastries

All really good. Like, the kind of stuff on which you can actually taste the refined carbs, sugar, deep fry and other crap, but you push that thought out of your head because it's good.

Sure, it's not gourmet, but for this price who's complaining?"}
{"text":"I'm actually ultra impressed with the price point in this place.  Most buns are 3 for 1$ and some of the better quality steamed buns are 2 for 1$

They have a good selection of regular chinese buns and it's super SUPER cheap.  I'd go here anytime you want to bring some nice quality buns, savoury or sweet, to a potluck."}
{"text":"Extremely competitive pricing and appealing offering. I think you get fantastic value, as well as rapid, clean and professional customer service
I strongly recommend it"}
{"text":"Came here after school to pick up some bakery items. Did not walk to Ding Dong or Hong Kong Island on Spadina Ave because of the dreadful wind today.

After reading the reviews here my expectation was set fairly low so I'd say it's not too bad of a Chinese bakery; you can pretty much find the common items: various buns (pineapple, sausage), egg tarts, mooncakes, winter melon cakes etc. I do find the presentation and selection a bit lacking though. To be perfectly honest I know there is probably nothing wrong with the freshness but if their egg tarts looked a bit more visually attractive like some other stores, not with broken crusts like what they have, I would buy them.

Anyways I bought some winter melon cakes and a cake roll. They were quite cheap and tasted decent. 

They have few tables and chairs if you wanna eat inside the store.

I have yet to go to Ding Dong on Spadina Ave to make a fair comparison but for now I find \"Chinese Bakery\" kind of forgettable for a Chinese bakery therefore I am giving it 3 stars.

Update: was trying the cake roll and it turned out to be coffee flavoured, not chocolate as I thought. Yet it was not indicated anywhere in the store like Hong Kong Island does and I just happen to HATE the coffee flavour. Plus, there was clear traces of eggshells in the cake. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Cheap but average chinese bakery
They have an everyday special of  3 egg tarts or certain buns for $1 which is really cheap. However, most of the buns looked old when I came in the afternoon. Like most places I visited in Canada, they accept american dollars on a 1 to 1 ratio"}
{"text":"Very rube staff on the phone. I tried to call and reserve a birthday cake. The clerk cannot address questions, did not want to reserve the cake, did not even write down my name, didn't even tell me when the store closed or if the store takes credit card. And it wasn't she didn't understand, all the rudeness was spoken in Chinese. 

Will never visit here again."}
{"text":"very good price - but they reduced amount of fillings again  - i go there since its easier to find parking nearby as i am handicapped - parking on spadina is a nightmare - bakery price is very good but they have reduced amount of their fillings again  -  wish i could find a chinese bakery nearby with easier access to parking - cheap price isn't everyrhing

reasonable selection

don't expect  to hear any english ...  lol

if someone has a recommendation for a chinese bakery near me - king/dufferin - please email me"}
{"text":"Due to the rising costs of ingredients, buns are now 2 for $1 says the signage.  The steamed buns are still 3 for $2.

I still like coming here. On a normal morning I'd have two normal size buns hot out of the oven because A) I like to eat them when fresh out of the over B) one doesn't seem satisfying enough as there are so many varieties C) you just want to try at least a savory and sweet

So while they are smaller than your normal ones, you can satisfy all three reasons with smaller portions. I usually opt for the ham+egg bun, the cocktail bun (this means coconut), the curry beef or the pineapple bun (not literally tasting like pineapple, just might look like it). Now if it was 3 for $1, I'd eat all three as well. Oh, it is 5 for $2 though.

This has been my go-to Chinese bun place because of the value and because my former go-to place is closed now. But I do like this place. Why would I want to pay more than $1 for one bun in the suburbs?"}
{"text":"This place makes great deep fried pork dumplings (oval-like shaped, brown and crispy, deep fried, pork filled dumplings).  They are packed with filling and perfectly crispy on the outside but soft and sticky on the inside.  They are also very cheap too. If you go after 5pm they sell them for 5 for $2.  They also make great mini veggie egg rolls, which they sell 5 for $2 after 5pm too.  It`s my default place to go if I want some deep fried goodness.

I can't comment on their baked buns as I don't normally get them from here."}
{"text":"Mocha roll - 2 stars, cake was too dry and barely any cream filling 
Mochi balls - 5 stars, good coconut flavor on the sweet rice ball. And good red bean paste filling. The red bean filling was not overly sweet. I really enjoy it."}
{"text":"Unlike the price of gas, there's a lot of variability in the pricing of Chinese buns. The bottom end seems to be 3 for $1. Mashion and Ding Dong up near Spadina and College seem to be the cheaper options. For those who are coming from Yonge/Dundas or, say, the art gallery and want to nosh on some chinese buns for that perfect \"what white people like\" weekend outing (white people love art galleries, ethnic food, and cheap eats they can brag about), Chinese Bakery is your convenient choice.

It's a touch dingy inside, mind you. But there are a number of tables if you want to make this the cheapest lunch spot on the street. Table space seems to be at a premium, however. I can usually find a table at Mashion or  Ding Dong."}
{"text":"Do NOT...I repeat, do NOT go there after their \"Grand re-opening\"!

They got closed about a month or two ago by the Canada food regulatory agency, and have just re-opened their store. What I see is a change of owner when I entered.

I was craving buns and fried sesame balls and \"salty triangle\" (also deep fried) when I went in. They had a promotion going on, $2 for a bag of 6-8 deep fried goodie. Given how hungry I was, I went ahead and bought two bags.

I greatly regretted my decision after I got home. The deep fried food (both the sesame balls & salty triangle) tasted like burnt lard oil. I can taste the strong favours of burnt pork intestines in it. It was absolutely DISGUSTING. As well, instead of the texture being soft and fluffy like I expected, it was full of sticky rice flours and tough to chew on. The content inside is minimal as well. So I went ahead and took a few bites into the buns, same thing, lots of flours and contents are minimal. Definitely not worth the money.

I will not go ever again. Would give a 0/5 if I can."}
{"text":"Egg tarts and BBQ pineapple buns are 4 stars- most other things win 3 stars. I like their red bean pineapple buns though.

Because of the service and the mostly-3-star reason, I am not rounding up.

Pastry is delicious and flaky for the tarts, buns are soft and springy, prices are cheap, just make sure to keep track of what you're supposed to pay and count the change to make sure you've been charged the correct amount. The bags they supply mostly are not the kind that seal, so you must tie them.

Service is very brusque. This isn't a problem for me, however my experience could definitley be lifted from neutral to pleasant if the workers smiled or spoke in lighter tones. They sell bags of egg tarts for a dollar. I think there are 6 per package. 

For some reason I always seem to come in when it is extremely empty or extremely busy. Either way, there are usually some older people sitting at the tables inside, drinking coffee or slowly eating their things. You will not be bothered if you sit down to eat your purchases and relax by watching people go past the window."}
{"text":"I quite like this bakery. Wide variety of baked goods and even seating for you to enjoy the food right after your purchase. I used to come here some I was a child and every time I visit Chinatown again, I would stop by here. This time I bought a deep fried taro pastry which was cold, I would've preferred it at least warm or room temperature. The milk tart and egg tart were good, I don't recall ever trying a milk tart before. The pastry was $0.60CAD for one or two for a dollar. The milk and egg custard tarts were also two for a dollar. I would prefer if this bakery allowed buying only one of each for some of the baked goods so that I can try it, rather than forcing me to buy two of each. Will be visiting again next time."}
{"text":"The steamed buns were delicious. I got two of each kind. I honestly couldn't differentiate between the three once they were combined into one bag, but still delicious nonetheless. I also got a couple of small hot dog bun and bbq pork buns. I highly recommend the hot dog buns as well!"}
{"text":"super cheap fresh and delicious! what more could you want. almost all the buns here are under a dollar, some are two for a dollar!!!!  come to this bakery and get cheap deliciousness!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years.  I remember Kim Moon but they closed down ages ago.  This was my second go-to.

Their pork steam bao are VERY good.

Went there late and unfortunately my favourite jean dwae were all sold out =( and they also did not have any da'an ta left.  She was trying to push the raisin twists.  Bought a sponge cake slice (don't want to think about the oil content) and a couple of melon wife cakes ...

The prices here are reasonable and the quality of the product fine.  But go early - they sell out quickly."}
{"text":"Service: typical Chinese restaurant service - not rude, but quick and gets the job done. They will pack your buns in small clear plastic bags, and you only get a bigger bag/box container if you buy over certain amount

Food: buns are freshly baked every morning about 2 hours apart (posted on their walls). Most basic and popular buns like pineapple bun, cocktail buns, bbq buns taste good, but not the best I've had in the neighbourhood. Some buns could be bigger or use more fillings, but for the dam cheap price for a snack, I'm not complaining!

Overall: I only stop by for a snack or 2 when I'm around, but when I'm feeling for better quality bites, I normally go to my preferred Hong Kong Island Bakery on Spadina!"}
{"text":"Um.... can you say -- YUMMY!

I was on a one-day business trip in Toronto, and I just love checking out Chinatowns in all the cities I go to.  I came to Chinatown on a rainy day, ate some dimsum at the Rol San restaurant next door, and saw this bakery.  I thought, \"Why not!\" and stepped inside.

I love the set up! It reminded me of the way Paris Baguette (korean bakeries) are set up, with a tray and some tongs that you can use to pick out your pastries.  Each item is labeled helpfully, and they had some really tasty treats.

I had the egg tarts and some sweet and sticky rice pastries that were up at the cash register.  The sweet and sticky rice pastries were filled with custard or red bean, and the custard ones really took the cake.  I loved those... yum.. Now I will have to patrol NYC chinatown until I find those again..."}
{"text":"I come here regularly mainly for the buns. $2 for a pack of 6 or so. They are affordable and make a nice snack. I'm not a fan of the deep fried taro pastry or the steamed pork buns (filling is tough and boring)."}
{"text":"Bought pork dumplings here.

The filling was very bland and almost non-existent. But, the price was very good, bag of 5 for $2. Here is my comparison to other downtown chinese bakeries:
-Hong kong Island offers these with the best flavour. 
-Ding dong bakery offers them at an acceptable flavour and keeps up well with demand.

Not interested in coming back here, the competition is better."}
{"text":"Prices are lower than others but that's because the buns are smaller. I'm not sure if it ends up being a better value in the end. The food tastes like every other Chinese bakery. Nothing special here. Point deductions for the piss poor service. Unlike other bakeries that give you the items in sealed bags, they try to stick 3 buns into one tiny (and open/unsealed) plastic bag.  One time 1 bun ended up toppling out as she was handing it to me because she tipped it over a bit and they refused to give a refund still. A bit ridiculous."}
{"text":"With the lemon yellow sign and the generic title you might think this place is a No Name product, but then you'd come to your senses when you notice the lack of Swiss type and the fact that this is a bakery, not a box on a shelf of a Loblaws. Think, man!

Anyway, the generic name is fitting because it's like any other similar spot in Chinatown. Full of baked and not-really-baked goods, this place has more tarts, buns, and balls than Halloween on Church Street. The M.O is pretty standard: grab a cafeteria tray, load 'er up, marvel at the unbelievably efficient packaging work at the cash register, deftly avoid their pitch to sell you day olds, hand over a laughably small amount of money and GTFO.

Bottom line: cheap and good. On Dundas West just East of Spadina on the south side of the street. Look for the store that sort-of-not-really-not-at-all-actually looks like a No Name product.

Obligatory Title Pun: Open SESAME balls!

Menu Readability: Dude. Just know what you're looking for. Signage in this place is useless.

Need to mention: Three BBQ Pork Buns for $2. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?

What this place teaches me about myself: I love to bask in seemingly-impossible prices."}
{"text":"Unique items: deep fried taro (quite tasty when fresh!) and other fried fare, Mexican Buns, cheap spring rolls. 
The facade might not look great, its a bit dark inside, and the name may be rather.. redundant, but pastries are really cheap."}
{"text":"This bakery has all the classic Chinese Bakery items with decent prices. It's cash only. I tried their steam pork bun (3 for $2 or 1 for $1), which was soft and warm! I've also had the pineapple red bean bun (can't go wrong with that) and their taro pastry (very interesting). I have no complaints about this place, it's my go to place. 

At the end of the day, they have a good deal where you can buy a random assortment of left over buns for a reduced price."}
{"text":"Fear not about the food inspection closure, they passed the last 3 inspections this year post grand re-opening.
