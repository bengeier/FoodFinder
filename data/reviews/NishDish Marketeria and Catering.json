{"text":"The food is packed with flavour, the people are overly friendly.  The selection is new and authentic. The food is clean, probably hand picked and the cook really puts allot of love and care. Into the meals that are served.  Definitely a place to explore, at least once."}
{"text":"Great! Had the elk chilli and corn bread. So, delicious. The staff are lovely."}
{"text":"I shared a bison burger with someone.  Price point is more than what I am used to paying for a burger. $14  I could not tell it was bison but the overall taste was ok. The bun I think is bannock. No sides are included. But I am happy to support a local indigenous business where the food is locally sourced."}
{"text":"Koreatown has a new flavour and its traditional Anishnawbe cuisine! Hands down, this spot is a must visit. You can also purchase other local products that support Indigenous businesses in Ontario. From tasty maple syrup to freshly roasted coffee beans. Great comfort food that will always satisfy your hunger. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is a real gem. Fresh, tasty food and great staff. Can be a bit slow (because it's a small operation) but if you can plan for it, it's so worth it!!"}
{"text":"I have no words for how awesome this place is.  I'm from the states and was visiting friends in Toronto - and this is the first place they wanted to take me.  I wasn't sure what to expect, even though I do have experience with First Nation food.  Let me tell you, it was excellent.  I admit, the place is small and it's very communal.  I imagine that when it's busy it's very cozy, but we happened to be there with only one other family so it was really spacious.  I ordered the corn cake and the breakfast tacos - and they made them with venison.  So glad to see additional meat options!  My two friends also opted for dishes with venison and they were not disappointed!    Food aside, the service was great.  You can tell the owner takes serious pride in what he does - and that's invaluable to me.  Go.  You will enjoy it!"}
{"text":"It was neat to try a place that serves authentic First Nation cuisine. The menu is small telling me that it must change depending on the season which means ingredients must be fresh! I came here for lunch on a Saturday and received warm hospitality from the staff. I ordered a breakfast sandwich which has your choice of wild game served in bannock bread. Since I'm not very familiar with wild game the staff was very helpful in assisting me with what to order.   I ended up ordering the boar since I'm partial to sausages. It was served with some sauteed veggies in the bannock. All in all it was very filling but I really felt like everything could have used more *flavour*. The bannock kind of overpowered everything because it was so thick (reminded me of a biscuit) and dry. I could barely taste the meat.   I'd give the place another chance. Maybe look into trying a stew or soup."}
{"text":"Stopped in here to check out the food prior to them catering an event for us in late June.   Been excited to visit of one of the few spots in the city offered First Nation cuisine! It's a small spot but packed with tons of personality. From the ceiling that you can appreciate to the tables and friendly staff. Community based and family run, perfect t neighborhood spot.   Tried their sweet grass tea which was light and refreshing cold. Their vegan corn bread with the sourced berry jam was a nice snack and their Bannock was delicious!   Had dinner plans so didn't want to over fill but everything smelled amazing.    Watched more than a few other patrons eat their delicious looking dishes with everything from game meat to wild rice!  Definitely a go to in the Christie Pits area!"}
{"text":"Would give a 4.5 if that were an option!  The food portions may look small on first glance but they're really filling. Very hearty food and at a good price. I had the wild rice casserole and a side of bannock and enjoyed it. Went with a friend and she had the elk chili and she gushed about it.  Their menu changes depending on what is in season which I like.  Only giving 4.5/4 instead of 5 because the restaurant is super cramped. I feel anxious when people stand over me while I'm sitting, and this happened a couple times while I was there. The service is a little slow so don't show up super hungry."}
{"text":"Wanted something different so we headed over to NishDish.   We ordered the Deer Stew with cornbread plus the Corn Pancake with berries and Venison sausage. Deer Stew had a generous portion of meat and veggies. Meat was tender, cornbread good. Corn pancake was perfect -  crispy on the outside, fluffy inside. Venison sausage was lean with minimal 'filler' meats. Everything was tasty and delicious.   Looking forward to returning and trying their other items.   Friendly service."}
{"text":"Sooooo goooood!!!!   Nothing makes me happier than delicious food that is filling and doesn't feel heavy - oh wait, except when it's locally sourced and served in a chill environment. NishDish is perfect for a shared meal - you're going to want to try as much of what's on today's menu because it's ALL delicious. Today I shared the Venison Flank Steak Sandwich on Bannock, the Elk Woodland Pie, a Strawberry Juice and a Saskatoon Berry and Watermelon Juice, and a piece of Gluten Free Chocolate Zucchini Cake -- our total was $37.80 before tip. The portions were fine - the sandwich looked small but the meal over all between two was quite filling. My husband said that even just half the pie alone would have been fine.   I first had NishDish at a catered event and was really excited to get the chance to have their food again - I was not disappointed and can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Great addition to Bloor St/Annex. First Anishnawbe restaurant in Toronto? An interesting menu; suggest trying salmon, buffalo. Would be nice to see them remain open past 5 pm. Variety in the food scene, so appreciated."}
{"text":"Wow. Wow. WOW!! I'm SO thrilled about this place, I'm not sure where to start! So FINALLY, real Canadian food. The location is in the old digs of Tacos El Asador (don't panic, they've moved to a bigger space directly across the street), so good Feng Shui abounds. The menu isn't huge (it's determined by what the catering menu is - they've been running this catering company for 12 years now) which comprises the primary bulk of their food production- for now) and this is also why the hours are a bit limited right now. But the prices are great - the portions aren't huge, but even if you order two, it's still worth it. I had the elk sausage that came with wild rice. I'd ordered a side of bannock - which reminded me of something else and the owner said that most people don't know that bannock is Scottish. The only thing was that (if you want to order Scottish bank) for $2 you only get a tiny square,  (with butter and jam), literally less than 2 inches by 2 inches, so not a bargain, but that's okay. My friend ordered the Three Sisters stew, which was good - vegan, tasty, not a huge portion, but still worth it for the price. Then, when I saw my friend's order of Apple Crumble (large portion and was delicious) for just $5, I ordered one too! We also got to try the Cedar Tea which was neat. I also had the iced tea (can't remember which kind) but it was tasty - not too strong. Don't come here with a huge party, expecting to find seating. There are two picnic tables and a few chairs at the counter by the window. You can always take out. I'm SO excited about this place because 1. It's about time we had something like this (real Aboriginal, Canadian food) 2. at an affordable price 3. I love that they're going to be selling cool products (there are already smoked maple syrup bottles, soaps, maple sugar candies, and great t-shirts - which I plan on buying for myself and wearing proudly) and there are great plans in the works. 4. The fact that menu changes daily is fantastic and exciting! The staff are all super friendly and amazing. The owner is, as well. I'm excited to see this place/area evolve. It's not going to just be Korea Town anymore! As I write this, I realize how hungry I am and guess where I'm going to head for brunch? Yep. See ya there!"}
{"text":"NishDish is a delicious addition to the Toronto lunch scene! If you like wild game, this is the place for you! Venison stew, wild rice and duck soup, and a little bannock on the side. This is also Toronto's very first Aboriginal owned and operated restaurant, that also does catering out of the same establishment.   Their breakfast wraps are to die! Your choice of bison chipotle sausage or wild boar bacon, along with egg, cheese and a few other choice ingredients inside. Really, this is a place you need to experience.   The reason for the lower score has nothing to do with the food. Thee service just wasn't great, but I suggest it was because they are still working out a few kinks - staff seemed new, they are managing a catering business out of the same small space, the espresso machine was acting up and the staff didn't know how to run it (they have espresso based coffees on the menu), and the staff seemed confused about portion size on the bannock. We were there for 2.5 hours and it wasn't because we were having a lazy lunch.   Don't get me wrong, the food is worth it! The staff just need to get a bit better trained and also have a proper introduction to the espresso machine. I'm looking forward to going back when in TO next because I am still having dreams about the breakfast wraps!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, and there are very few places like it in the city.  There aren't many places for First Nations food in Toronto, when there really should be more. My exposure to it has been limited, but NishDish is certainly a good way to experience.  Their constantly-changing menu features food that you won't find in most places: just today, I had a deer heart steak - which was absolutely fantastic.   Super friendly service - and for a small restaurant, that really matters."}
{"text":"Have tried the catering at an event and stopped in for a coffee. Really enjoyed both experiences and look forward to spending more time in the space. Wonderful to see Anishinaabe food being celebrated."}
{"text":"The space is cozy, the service is good and the food is great! I got the corn Johnnycakes with 2 eggs and my husband got the breakfast plate with boar bacon and bannock.  I really enjoyed the corncakes, it was crispy and buttery and the edges and soft in the middle with berries mixed in. A bit of my corncake was undercooked and that was a little unpleasant. My husband enjoyed his meal and I tried some of his wild rice - so good.  I see us coming back here for the wild rice cakes and to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"NishDish is a seasonal indigenous restaurant located in Korean town. They served up super yum gluten free corn bread ($2.5)! It was so delicious that I forgot to take a photo! I was not really planning to review it initially. However it was so so yum, that my joy molecules were jumping with joy! It deserves a shout-out!   I will definitely be back to try other dishes! Thank you for the quick and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and fantastic people! So grateful for this spot in Toronto! Thank you Carsey Yee for letting me know of this place! The art is beautiful, the food is tasty and the staff is incredibly friendly. We had lunch here while seated at a beautiful large wooden table. I enjoyed sharing the table with others communally. The atmosphere is low-key and friendly. I had the seven sisters vegetable stew which was nicely spiced and went well with the traditional bread. As it was my birthday, the co-owner of the restaurant kindly brought me a slice of their chocolate almond cake...not too sweet and just delicious! They also sell lovely merchandise including a booklet on gardening on balconies, T-shirts and handmade soaps. Highly recommended and I will definitely be returning to this place. #NishDish"}
