{"text":"J'y étais allé par hasard , l'ambiance est super, le menu n'est pas si cher, et j'avais pris un steak avec une cuisson \"bien cuit\" et le chef est venu me voir en me disant que pour ce genre de qualité de viande, je devrais vraiment essayé une cuisson moins forte, j'ai aimé qu'il prenne le temps de venir me voir et je l'ai écouter, c'était super bon! j'y retournerai c'est sur"}
{"text":"Oro Toro is a new restaurant located in a convenient spot with ample parking.  I was unsure how to classify the type of cuisine since the menu jumps around a little.  I suppose the majority of the menu is comfort food, but there is a good amount of influence from various Asian cuisines as well.  There is a good amount to choose from.

We were there with quite a large group (25 or so) for a friends birthday.  We were seated in one of the raised sections and had it mostly to ourselves, but it was not a private room by any means.  The decor is all new and nicely done.  Oro Toro is kid / baby friendly as well.  They brought a high chair and even though there was some crying, the restaurant was loud enough that we din't stick out like a sore thumb.

We started with an order of the calamari which is fried and served in a sweet chili Thai sauce.  The sauce was not bad, but quite sweet.  It was also all over the calamari which basically removed chance of it still being crispy.  The service was quite slow however, so it may have been crispy a few minutes earlier.  

For my main, I ordered the \"boeuf braisé\" and my wife had a spicy rice dish with shrimp.  There was a very long wait between courses, at least 25-30 minutes.  When our mains arrived, mine had obviously been under the heating lamp for quite some time.  The flavours were good, but the sauce on top had actually formed a small skin in from sitting too long.  My wife really enjoyed her spicy rice dish.  Both dishes felt slightly pre-prepared to me though.

I don't think I'll be back for a romantic evening, but perhaps for another party of some kind or for a business lunch it would be appropriate.  The service was definitely slower than average, but the staff was courteous and did a good job acclimatizing to our larger group.  They even kept a cake in the fridge until we were ready to serve."}
{"text":"I went to Oro Toro with my Hubby tonight! Well located across the street from Namur metro. It's way at the back, past the Suzy Shier, etc. We had a Tuango coupon for an amazing full course dinner for 2 people. 

The food was great and there is a super wide variety on the menu. I'd say there has to be something for everyone. For the appetizer I ordered the house-made  potato chips with the blue cheese sauce. After giving them a fair try, I did not like it and the *very nice* waiter offered me another appetizer! I was so impressed! So in replacement for that I took the Oro Toro Dip (goat cheese [there wasn't too much], cream cheese, peppers, mushrooms accompanied with tortilla chips and baguette bread). That time round it was good. 

Next was the main meal. I chose the Baked Atlantic Salmon with the choice of a side (I picked the house salad, which was great). The meal was awesome. Then as part of the coupon we had dessert. I picked the White Chocolate Banana Cream Pie and my Hubby had the cheesecake. The cheesecake slice was surprisingly thin. Very thin... almost nothing to it - maybe because we were using a coupon and we paid less? I don't know. My pie was good, not great, but good.

The waiter was attentive and clearly knew how to handle customers. He had personality to boot. We were welcomed into the seating area right away. 

Overall I gave this resto 5 stars because it met my three most critical criteria for a \"return-worthy\" rating:
1- Good Service; 2- Quality Food or Product; 3- Reasonably Priced.

I'd also like to add that this restaurant is a GREAT pick for a romantic evening. 

Thanks for reading!"}
