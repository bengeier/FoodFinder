{"text":"This is a Vietnamese gem!  Try the pho and spring rolls and you'll walk away with a smile."}
{"text":"Bang for your buck! Love this place, as good if not better than other Vietnamese places in town, except so much more closer to campus than any of them. Their menu is simple but so far everything I've tried was good. And at a really really great price! big bowl of pho or vermicelli costs only $7. Their banh mis are also pretty good."}
{"text":"Disappointed.

I really, really want there to be a good Banh Mi and Pho location in Champaign, but this isn't it.  

My wife and I got two different Banh Mi sandwiches, the #7 and #8.  They were $5, not the $4 that others mention.  I bring this up because I couldn't find a menu online - and because there are times that a $4 sandwich is fine, but the same sandwich for $5 or $6 seems disappointing.  

This was one of those times.  The bun came from a package; I was hoping for the crispy bun I've had from other banh mi places.  Most of the sandwich was vegetables piled high, with a little meat hidden underneath.  And a little cilantro and a few pieces of jalepeno pepper.  Though the menu promised pate, there was perhaps a half tablespoon spread very thin across the bread.  (I checked because I couldn't taste it.)

This place reminds me of Xinh Xinh, at least based on the other reviews.  I felt that Xinh Xinh started strong and then started cutting corners once they'd established a reputation.  That seems to be what's happening here.  I'd look elsewhere for near-campus food.

Maybe someday C-U will have a good banh mi place, but this isn't it."}
{"text":"With the new school year, this restaurant has changed ownership. The old owners of Xinh Xinh have taken over. 

Unfortunately, the food is not at the same level as the old Xinh Xinh I remember. I've had both the pho and the duck noodles. The pho's broth was watery and lacking in flavor. The duck noodles were not bad, but the duck was incredibly bony. I struggled to recover any meaningful amount of meat from my dish. I haven't had any of their rice plate dishes yet, but they used to be good."}
{"text":"I got the noodles with soybean paste and pork, and my friend got the pho. The quantity they give you is definitely worth your money. But it's easy to miss the sign from outside!

The taste is authentic and very clean. The noodles with soybean paste and pork were on the saltier side and the pho was less oily and not as savory as other places. If you're looking for more traditional food on campus, I highly recommend this place. BUT, if you're like me and aren't too big on the traditional taste, I would recommend going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Hard to spot from the outside! Their noodles aren't hand pulled like I thought they would be but the broth is pretty good. They serve foods like yang rou pao mou that is hard to find at other restaurants."}
{"text":"This is not a Vietnamese restaurant. A friend and I ordered 2 different noodle soups. They use the same broth base which is pretty much salty water. Hardly any meat and veggies. Just not worth the money. Do yourself a favor by buying some top ramen from the store, several  heads of Bok choy, some herbs and make it yourself. Not only will it taste much better, you will also feed yourself for the week or so. Honestly, the food is not worth the amount you are paying for it. As a student on a budget, there are better ways to spend your money."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the noodles with soybean paste and pork!!! The texture of noodles is perfect and paste is just delicious."}
{"text":"This place is excellent for a quick bite on campus. Note: they only take cash. I usually get the wonton soup or the beef stir fry - both are delicious. The Bahn Mi sandwich is quite flavorful, but a bit lacking in meat. The owners are incredibly sweet and sometimes they give me rice pudding samples (which are great) while I wait for my food. The food usually takes 2-4 minutes to make, so this is a good choice to grab something in between classes or on a lunch break."}
{"text":"I've  eaten here a few times, and it's a pretty decent restaurant.  Each time, i've had an egg roll and it's a bit inconsistent.  The first time, it was atop a cold noodle dish.  It seemed promising.  I wasn't crazy about the filling.... It's pork mixed with other things but it seemed mushy.   The dish itself (i forget what it was called) but it was on the specials board beside the register) was ok.... It had lots of julienned veggies, cold noodles, pork and the egg roll... I wasn't crazy about it....i was sort of hoping for a hot dish, but this is what the gentleman behind the counter recommeneded.  

The second time, I had the pho.... It was really good... Better than Xinh Xinh.... But I think I like Pho 911's better.... Everything was good about it, but I just like the texture of Pho 911 noodles and taste of broth.   This time the egg roll was soggy and luke warm...it had obviously been sitting out for a while....

The third time I had the banh mi.   It was a decent sandwich....piled high with veggies and pork but there was a lot of mayo.... That was a turn off for me.  The egg roll this time was fresh, hot and crispy, but now I'm convinced that i really don't like the filling.

This is a decent restaurant and if i was in the area again, I would definitely eat here (as opposed to Fat Sandwich two doors down).  But it's not something i would go out of my way for.   The prices are cheap ($7 Pho, .75 egg roll, and $4.95 banh mi) so it's definitely student friendly prices!"}
{"text":"This little restaurant is tucked away in the chain of little restaurants on John Street, right next to Fat Sandwich Company and Insomnia. Since it was one of the few on-campus restaurants I had never been to, my friend and I decided to go there on a whim. 
The staff was quite friendly, but there was a significant language barrier. I decided to order the Hot Dry Noodles and a Pork Bun, while my friend ordered the Rice Noodles with soup. 

The dishes came out within minutes, so that was nice. 
However, the meals themselves were very mediocre, and really quite disappointing. Unfortunately, every dish was incredibly bland. The Pork Buns, which should have been delicious and flavorful, were surprisingly bland. The outer bun portion also tasted stale, as if it was a few days old. The Hot Dry Noodles were immensely bland, having a giant mound of noodles on a plate with very little veggies or anything else. The Rice Noodles with Soup were also quite bland, but not as flavorless as the Hot Dry Noodles. They do provide chili oil at each table, as well as salt and pepper, but nothing worked to help elevate the flavor of any dish. In fact, the chili oil at our table tasted very strange as well. 

The only saving grace to this place is that its noodles themselves tasted incredibly fresh, like they had actually been made that day. If the noodles had any flavor or spice to go along with it, this place could become a bit more popular on campus, but with all of the flavorful dishes that nearby competition like Bangkok Thai offer, there is no reason that I would come back to this place."}
{"text":"the soup is so good !  i just stop by for my lunch time ! the store serve Vietnamese food very fast ...beat my short lunch time .....the lady she is very nice than my mom!!! may be i be back every day for my lunch or dinner ......"}
{"text":"Their grilled chicken was so okay. It just looked like they microwaved the food. The place is a little sad too. The dishes were piled up and employees seem not motivated with their work."}
{"text":"What sweet little spot for pho. I would have never noticed this place if I hadn't heard about it from a friend-- it's teeny tiny and tucked away near Fat Sandwich. It's dirt cheap (everything is around $5), and I have no complaints about the food. Since the plague that is winter has hit Chambana, it's been a bit disheartening walking out of my class into pitch blackness at only 5pm. But a hot bowl of pho on a rainy, windy night after a long day can cure all of my ills. 

Note: I don't think they have a customer restroom."}
{"text":"I stopped by on a whim. I'm so glad i did. It was amazing. I had the zhajiangmian and these tasted just like my grandpas. I'm from California and this was better than most of my local spots. Salty, meaty, with really well-cooked noodles that cut the flavor and was not overwhelmed. Cucumbers were fresh, too. Honestly if I could go here everyday, I would. I truly loved it and appreciated the memory. 

The service is no-nonsense. You order, you pay, you grab. I had no problem with it--the total process of ordering to getting my food was at most 15 minutes. So not quite fast food but.... Why would you compare good quality, fresh food to McDonalds anyway? 

I didn't get them but the dumplings were a steal! They looked good too. 

In short: efficient, tasty and fairly priced (cheap, considering what you get). What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good although the seats are limited. If you're looking for a quick lunch or dinner, this is the place to try."}
{"text":"My first time at Asian Taste today, I ordered the #9: Fried Garlic Sauce Noodles. The noodles are wide (like pappardelle), but made with rice flour, which makes them wonderfully chewy. The fried garlic sauce is delicious -- slightly sweet, slightly sour, but overall salty and savory with a fragrant garlic taste and crushed red pepper flakes bringing the heat. The noodles are also sprinkled with scallions and slick with the delicious oil. Julienned cucumber is served on the side of the bowl, which adds a needed fresh note. The portion was generous, and I loved every bite. Service was fast. Prices are relatively low (noodles: $5.95, bottled water: $1).

The restaurant is difficult to spot. It's tucked in from street view. The interior is small, with just a few booths, a couple of picnic tables, and some stools at a back counter. The place fills up fast at lunch, so get there early or expect to wait. The folks behind the counter don't speak much English, so if you do, order by the menu number. Expect to eat with chopsticks. 

Pro-tip: for the long, wide noodles, arrange a noodle into layers and stab through with the tips. I don't know if this is legit, but it worked for me!"}
{"text":"My husband and I read reviews and saw pictures on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  Alas, for whatever reason, it seems things have changed at this restaurant.  Banh mi are now $5 each, with the exception of the tofu one which costs more.  I got the grilled pork and pate one, and it was majorly disappointing.  A few skimpy slices of bbq pork, which was kind of spam-like; not a problem by itself, but for $5 and the quantity I kind of expected actual grilled pork slices.  The worst part was the pate, though.  There were seriously like three smears of it.  Basically all I could taste was the pickled vegetables, which were abundant.  My Vietnamese iced coffee was mostly ice and I finished it while we were waiting for the food to be ready."}
{"text":"Management has since changed to the owners of Xinh Xinh. Unfortunately, the quality has since gone down; the pho has a similar quality to Xinh Xinh  and is still decent for your cravings, but nothing special. The pork and rice dish I tried here was better under earlier management and had more for your money. Still good for Vietnamese food in Champaign, but not as good as before."}
{"text":"I'm a critical reviewer, but the good was very good and that's what matters at a Chinese restaurant. I ordered the beef noodle soup and it was soo good, like the beef was super fall-apart-in-ur-mouth and flavorful. Noodles and soup were tasty and not too salty. My friend got the handmade noodles and the pork bun thing (sorry I'm not very knowledgeable on Chinese food terminology despite being Chinese haha) and both looked great and he said it was tasty. My friend also mentioned that it's like Xi'an food if that means anything to you. Overall it's a great hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant that makes better-than-average Chinese food. Just note that for under $10 they charge extra 50 cents if you pay by card."}
{"text":"Feels like dining in China, recommend wonton, pita bread soaked in lamb soup, ????will try ??next time"}
{"text":"I always can see full of Chinese at this place. And finally I went there. The food is mostly northern Chinese food including noodles, dumplings and some cold dishes. I tried stewed pork bun and beef noodle. Beef noodle with the chili oil is the best combination. Just average Chinese food. The flavor is just ok but super super Chinese. I went there with my Indonesian friend and he didn't like the taste of the beef. Maybe that's the taste of sesame oil? As for the pork bun, the stewed pork was just too salty for me, definitely not what I expected. Btw, this place is cash only( POS is broken?)"}
{"text":"This place was awesome, then they jacked up the prices. 6 dollars for 2 spring rolls is insane. Factor in the fact that I would then eat them on picnic table. The experience just isn't worth it. I got a Bahn Mi instead, and it was disappointing."}
{"text":"Hands down the most authentic place i've been to on campus for mainland chinese food. Also the best noodle on campus. Not for the faint of heart, best for people willing to try new things like beef tripe or pig ear (which are both done excellently here). Set meals are cheap, and plentiful. While they may not be flashy, the flavors are all there and brings immense satisfaction as just good, simple wholesome food. definitely a must try on campus!"}
{"text":"I had the pork Bánh Mì and I thought it was pretty good. Especially given the price was only 3.85 for each one. While certainly it might not compare to some of the other Vietnamese places in Chicago, the place is definitely one of the best places here on campus. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"This place has the best Chinese noodle on campus. Everything taste exactly like home. The price is a bit more than I expected but still reasonable. They serve signature Chinese entree that's rarely found in IL. This is great"}
{"text":"Asian Taste: A home away from home. It is the go to place when I feel homesick and want some Vietnamese food. 

I just visited this place in the fall of '14 and I have to say, the atmosphere has improved from last year. Gone is the mainstream American music and in its place is Vietnamese music. They added a few cosmetic items to give the place a more Vietnamese vibe and even a couple fish tanks. Now on to the food.

The menu has improved from last year and the variety beats anything other oriental store offers for Vietnamese cuisine. I personally enjoy the bun thit nuong. 

As a kid from the suburbs, I've been to Argyle in Chicago and had the experience there. In particular the banh mi is a different experience, flavor and texture wise, from a place like Nhu Lan or Ba Le, but I enjoy the banh mi here. It is also authentic. 

If I were to compare their pho and bun bo hue to my parents, then they would be in serious trouble. Of course, nothing beats a meal from you parents right? I've ate at a couple places on campus that served Vietnamese food and although they were in some aspects tastier, they lacked the authenticity that Asian Taste has. The soups Asian Taste has may seem little bland to other stores, they provide all the condiments that should be included in the dish. Frankly if I were to score the soups then it would be a 4/5.

I think this store will to continue to grow and improve and I do believe that this will continue to be my home away from home."}
{"text":"Restaurant review
I am surprised this finally happen. I was looking for Vietnamese food and thought why not try this small restaurant on campus. The food pics looked amazing, however I was quite surprised when i came in and found no Vietnamese food at all on the menu. They must have changed owners and kept the restaurant name. There was very traditional asian noodle dishes i.e. beef and noodle with cilantro and a clear broth. I was not expecting anything amazing, but the flavors were simply off the wall. The broth itself was clear and seasoned well. I did not have the post MSG or salt thirstiness after dinner so it might be actual broth made with chicken. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the seasoned beef slices had the right tenderness. After eating all of the noodles, i wanted to drink all of the soup. Hands down one of the best classic beef chinese noodle soup. It reminds you of the famous Taiwanese beef noodle dish! I will definitely be back. 

Pros: inexpensive, fresh ingredients, great soup/broth

Cons: very small tables, hard to find restaurant (tucked away on the side of the building)

Hidden deals: None

Health code rating: B. Kitchen area was clean. Health rating's okay not out of compliance significantly. http://champaign.il.gegov.com/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=1961"}
