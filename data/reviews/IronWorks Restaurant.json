{"text":"Got a burger here and opted for the onion rings instead of french fries.  Once the food arrived, after a considerable wait and empty water glasses, I instantly regretted my decision.  The onion rings were those skinny little fried, non-onion, onion rings that seem to be showing up everywhere lately.  While they are all fine and good on a burger, as a side they are a major disappointment.  The burger was pretty much a McBurger with a bigger bun.  I could have handled the average food if the service wasn't so lackluster.  Go for the golf, don't stay for the food."}
{"text":"Slow service, slow food, decent taste. I would only recommend if you don't mind waiting for everything."}
{"text":"Great food, fair prices and homey atmosphere!
Fun events such as karaoke and corn hole tournaments!Great place to watch sports...lots of TVs!
Their outdoor patio overlooks a lovely pond!
Friday all you can eat fish fry is only $9.99 and delicious!
It's owner and wait staff are all very friendly and create a casual welcoming atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This is the best little restaurant. If you love The Place just up the road, you'll love Ironworks. Friendly waitstaff, and a lovely view out the back, it's a gem hidden away on the golf course. (My nephews like coming and looking at the ducks, roadrunners and geese.)"}
{"text":"A go-to neighborhood place for comfort food, hidden away in the Bellair development a few blocks north of Bell Road. An memorable chicken-fried steak (it's got me thinking about how good another would be for Sunday breakfast, but I don't dare - one is indulgence, two is perdition :-) ) and a perfectly acceptable shrimp combo platter. It's the kind of place won't come to mind as a first choice for a meal out - it lacks distinctive character - but seems to serve up reliable, basic American cuisine, at a not unreasonable price. Looks like a good breakfast menu. Deserves better than three stars, but it's not quite up to four. Late hours! - nice, considering that most resto's in the area seem to close pretty early. Saturday night karaoke, starting at ten, if that's to your taste. It's worth a return visit."}
{"text":"We were driving west on Bell Rd when we both decided we were hungry for fish fry. So since we were close to Bellair area we stopped in at Iron Works for their all you can eat fish fry.
The fish was very tasty and cooked to perfection.
Served with fries and coleslaw, which were also very yummy. Once in awhile the coleslaw is a bit too sweet, this time was just perfection!
Wait staff very friendly and quick to bring more fish or whatever else you desire more of.
We will continue to dine at Iron Works and suggest it as a nice place to  dine for anyone else wanting a yummy fish fry!
And they also have a great window area to view the golf course and ducks."}
{"text":"2/2/11- Talk about going downhill! Dunno know if it is a new mgr or what but when I get a roll with my salad and the bottom half is covered in black mold...EEK! 

This little stuck-in-the-seventies place is the restaurant at the Belair Golf Course off of Bell Rd. Its really somewhat of a hidden gem though if you're looking for regular ol' American food. Its quiet, has a lovely view of the lake, peaceful, good service and above average food. The breakfast is especially good with the chicken fried steak being my personal favorite. Its actually real steak not some pre-breaded b.s. I like the club sandwich for lunch- generous amounts of meat, fresh lettuce & tomato, hot fries- how can you go wrong? My only reason for not giving it another star would be the decor. Its perfectly fine, I guess. It's clean. Its just so seventies. But, hey, go there to relax with friends, get a drink from the bar and soak up the seventies charm."}
{"text":"I like this place, I really like fish fry on Fridays
They use to have sold cod lightly battered and that was great . Now, it's thin fish fillet heavy breaded fried fish, sucks. Bar and staff always great food going down the exit pipe."}
{"text":"Very good food for what the price is. Nice service, very attentive. Elaine was very nice. First time I had fried pollock. The clam chowder was good but could have been hotter. The fries were good but the seasoning I could do without. But overall I was happy with the food. I would come back to try something different."}
{"text":"Our club met at Iron Works - and it was fabulous!  The food was great, the room was private - and Elaine was super wonderful in catering to our needs.  We can't wait to go back and meet there again!  SLEEK Toastmasters loves this venue!!"}
{"text":"This is such a nice place. 

My boyfriend and I can sit on the patio for hours, sipping on drinks, watching golfers and enjoying the birds and the scenery. 

The food is great as well."}
{"text":"We went here for their Easter brunch. I had reserved a table for the patio because the view is great. They had lost the reservation but luckily had a table available. We were outside enjoying the view when someone is smoking two tables away. We ask the staff and they advise the no smoking is not enforced on the patio. Luckily they were able to accommodate us inside. The food was good and had nice flavor. It is a shame people who don't want to breathe in cigarette smoke cannot enjoy the beautiful view."}
{"text":"Came here on 12/16/2013 for a Christmas Party. There was 32 of us at he event. We had three selections to choose from off the menu. Chicken Alfredo, Pork Chops and grilled Salmon. 

Considering there was 32 of us the service we received from  our waitress was absolutely outstanding. She put pitchers of water and ice tea out for us in addition to pots of hot coffee.
 
My choice of an entrée was the grilled salmon. It was perfectly cooked. Tender flaky and tasty. It came with rolls & butter, A house salad, wild rice and green beans. Everything was delicious. 

My wife ordered the pork chops. They also am grilled. Carol had me try a bite. The pork was succulent. It wasn't dried out and was very tasty. Not at all what I was expecting. The dish came with rolls, apple sauce & broccoli.  

FOOD: Everything was cooked the way it should be. SERVICE: Absolutely superb.  PRICE: Prices were a bit high. AMBIANCE: Nice clean environment. CONCLUSION:  RETURN FACTOR100%. 
  
    ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************

{"text":"Great food, great service, I was a regular until I moved to the other side of town. Get the Eggs in a Nest! Nancy the waitress is great, Louis the cook is a hoot and the food is great. Oh and the steak Caesar salad! I could swim in that dressing!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Been here countless times for lunch and dinner. Been here for a communion party and a 30th bday. Such a great environment. Love eating outside near the lake. Love seeing all the different bird at sunset. I will post some. Food is really good. Love the coconut chicken strips! Yummy!"}
{"text":"We have been going to IronWorks Restaurant for probably 7 or 8 years if not longer.  Despite the long drive from where we live, it has been our go to place for the all you can eat fish on Friday nite.  No matter the size of our party, the food was served fast and the service was good.  I guess that was days of the past now!
But I have to say after last Friday's visit, we will no longer go there.  The service was so bad and the food was not much better.  We didn't get there until about 6:45 or 7.  Not late for a Friday night, waiting for everyone to get home from work.  There was probably only 5 or 6 tables with people eating.  We were seated at a table down by the other patrons, when there were many, many tables at the other end of the dining room vacant and waited.  Nearby patron was very loud, couldn't even have a decent conversation.  Finally we were able to give our drink order to the young waitress.  Water, soda and 1 beer.  Water came quickly.  A bit longer for the sodas.  And we had to remind them of the beer (bottled) twice, when we finally got to order our meal, after waiting a very, very long time.   My husband was the only one who ordered the all you can eat fish, the reason he wanted to go there.  We waited, and waited for the order.  Had to remind the waitress about the beer.  Apparently, on Fridays, if you don't order fish, they have to figure out how to make the rest.  Food finally arrived.  I would say we literally had been there 1/2 hour to 45 minutes, and were ready to walk out at that point.  Food was very, very disappointing.  The rest of our party was complaining about the lack of quality and flavor of their food.  Chicken Fried Steak, Chicken Sandwiches, Chicken Strips and San Francisco Melt.  We were literally the last table to be served, the other tables were done eating.  Waitress didn't follow up.  When we asked for a second bottle of beer, it was forever before it came and we again had to remind the waitress. How difficult is it to get a bottle of beer from the bar?  When my San Francisco Melt was served, the waitress said be careful, plate is very hot, which kind of confused me for a grilled sandwich, but then I realized it had been sitting under the heat lamp for a very long time.  The rest of the party complained about the lack of flavor with the food.  My grand-daughter said the chicken strips reminded her of stuffing???  My daughter said the chicken on the sandwich (or maybe was turkey) was like store bought packaged meat.  The chicken fried steak was bland and tough.   My husband was never asked if he wanted more fish.  I asked him how the fish was (reason we went there) and he said not so good.  The waitress asked how our food was and we said not so great, and she kind of giggled, seemed not concerned and nothing was said to us,  I just requested our check so we could get out of there.  It seemed like the Staff was standing around talking most of the time and not attending their customers..  Just such poor service and food.  The manager was notified about it on our way out (at close to 9:00).  She seemed very unconcerned about our visit and comments about the food and service.  Didn't offer us any apology or discount.  This will be our last visit there.  A once excellent restaurant has gone downhill so bad.  Never again."}
{"text":"This place is so good.  The food is wonderful, the employees all know me by name, the atmosphere is laid back.  I love to go for breakfast, where my grandson and I can enjoy the geese and the other wildlife on the lake, the atmosphere is very peaceful, allowing for a great place to take a bunch of friends and actually be able to hear each while we enjoy great meals, and their specials are always tasty.  My only dislike ever, was their pasta, and that's a personal sauce preference."}
{"text":"When you first enter the restaurant the smell of stale smoke smacks you in the face. The décor is so worn down I do not think it has ever been updated. The view of the greenish/brown pond is the only relief that you get from drab run down dinning room. Our waiter was inattentive and disorganized, we had to ask him multiple times for the same things throughout the meal. Every time we asked him for something it would be 20 minutes before we saw him again. He messed the bill up and it took him 15 minutes to fix it and another 15 minutes to bring change. I ordered the eggs benedict which I thought tasted great. My husband on the other hand ordered the chicken fried steak skillet which was burnt and extremely chewy. Overall this was a poor experience. The only reason I would go back would be to sit on the patio when the weather is nice and drink a beer!"}
{"text":"Came for breakfast,  but when I saw the roast beef sandwich with green chillies and cheddar cheese, I opted for that, and boy, was I happy!!! I find it surprising this sandwich is difficult to find in Phoenix,  so when I do find it,  it is a must try. Probably the best I have tasted -- lots of lean beef, thick full strips of green chilli, medium cheddar, nicely done grilled bread not dripping of butter (hate when grilled sandwiches are greasy with butter/oil). Every bite was hot and delicious.

Hubby ordered the chicken fried steak, eggs and hash browns.  I am not a fan of white gravy,  but this one I liked -- it had flavor,  imagine that!!! The breading on the chicken fried steak,  was very light, crispy and seasoned perfectly.  The steak was not chewy, either. .. good point here as a chewy steak just turns me off!!! Hubby loved every bite, especially the gravy,  he is a fan of country gravy,  and said it was the best he had had. 

It was a great experience,  and we are eager to return -- hubby wants that meatloaf!!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast on the patio! Perfect place to watch golfers, have a coffee, and an omelet. 

They offer a great fish fry on Friday's too."}
{"text":"Not a bad place but definitely not hip. Inside is definitely outdated and suited for senior citizens. However, Great view on the patio. Nice to relax after eating... We had fish fry. Tasted like frozen fish and the tarter sauce tasted like store brand. Overall ehh.."}
{"text":"Went to Ironworks for their Mother's Day brunch 2014.  I certainly did not expect Scottsdale brunch quality food, but I had expected it to be edible.  The non-homemade mini muffins were literally the only thing that I ate.  2 out of 4 of the adults are still sick from the food....24 hours later.  My two children, whom eat almost anything, left there starving because they wouldn't eat the food.  The prime rib was horrific.  My mom asked for egg whites in her omelette and was simply told NO.  Not even an attempt to accommodate the guest with yolk allergies.

This experience cost $120, which happens to be a lot of money to me.  For the sake of how sick my mom and husband are from their food....I would have preferred to throw that hard earned money away!

The service on the other hand was great.  Our server was friendly and efficient.  Not enough for me to ever go back or recommend this place though."}
{"text":"A charming place on the Bellaire golf course with inside, outdoor seating views of the greens, a lake of ducks and geese. It surpasses all chain food restaurants in the area and has extended hours of operation 6:30 AM-11:00 PM, breakfast, lunch, dinner. Best value for quality with generous portions, inclusive of all meal accompaniments.  Full menu offering light to heavier fare with Prime rib, steaks cooked to perfection as ordered. Friendly, efficient staff. Our server Elaine couldn't have been more accommodating answering questions, providing recommendations, options, substitutions. Definitely the place to go!"}
{"text":"We came as a party of 6 on a relatively slow Friday night. From the moment we sat down the service was slow. We were not greeted by anyone at our table for quite some time. Once we were greeted the server took our drink orders and went on. The server stated the reason for the delay in service was due to a staff snafu in the kitchen causing confusion amongst the menu and the servers (???). We then saw the servers and bussers casually talking while we were awaiting our drinks. We finally got our drinks after what seemed like quite some time with the exception of my drink, which did not arrive. After two more trips by a busser and the server, it did not dawn on them that I was missing a drink causing me to ask again. We then ordered our food. The rolls served are standard dinner rolls you buy by the bag from the grocery store. They weren't heated or even accentuated. Just plain rolls. The mozzarella sticks were clearly frozen beforehand. Grocery store, boxed quality, which is baffling because they are so simple to make in a well stocked kitchen. Two turkey sandwiches were ordered, which both diners complained that the turkey tasted of grocery store packaged quality. My wife ordered chicken strips and fries (safe,right?), which are breaded oddly with breadcrumbs tasting of thanksgiving stuffing. Just a very odd flavor and very dry. My grandfather-in-law ordered the all you can eat fish and chips. He, being a longtime favorite of the restaurant, felt the need to apologize to us because he found his meal subpar. My food was horrendous. Started off with a cup of clam chowder, very bland and not true clam chowder whatsoever. Should be revised if not removed from the menu entirely. On to the main meal, the mashed potatoes were old. It was easy to tell they had been sitting for quite some time before serving. The chicken fried chicken was absolutely dreadful. It was over cooked, dry, and tasted as if it had been previously frozen and reheated. Fresh fried chicken tends to be juicy with oil residue within the breading. This was not the case. It was dry and tough. A fork should easily slice through a fresh chicken breast. It did not. The gravy was powdered gravy, not freshly made. I wish I could've washed the dry food down with a drink, but a refill needed to be requested a couple times. When asked by the server how the food was, we all kind of moaned and groaned without saying it blatantly sucked. The server nervously laughed and just said \"great! Is there anything else I can get you?\". Um, we all voiced displeasure, why would we want anything else? Lastly, the manager was notified of these issues. She seemed just as confused as we were as diners. When told about the chicken fried chicken, she proceeded to tell me they did not serve chicken fried chicken. She then realized the meal I was referring to and blatantly said \"that's not real fried chicken\" and nervously laughed. Um, what? Yeah I could tell. There just seemed to be a lack of accountability of the employees and it was a perplexing experience. 1-star is accurate depiction for tonight."}
{"text":"Good food at a fair price. 2 eggs hit cakes and bacon for $9.80. Friand endly lady behind the bar. One concern: right before for my meal ame out one of the managers entered the bar and was screaming profanity at the top of his voice. He repeatedly use the F word and was going on about someone leaving the 18th wlhole. My strong concern was that there were lot of children out on the driving range and maybe one of the might find the way into the restaurant or the bar. I really hope this is resolved because this was the one downside of what was a really great eating experience."}
{"text":"I'm a tenured diner; Hospitalities is my game. You might say I'm say I'm a \"seasoned vet\" when it comes knowing what works and what doesn't.

I dropped in the other day to hit a few balls. Middle of the days - my style.. 

The scorching hot weather was too for me so, I called it a day. 

I wasn't in the lounge more than 5 minutes before the barmaid politely asked me what I'd like. 

Usually Ima vodka rox kinda guy but it was a little too early to all liquored up so I opted for my usual. Beer.

I was hungry so I started with the Chili with extra caso - it was superb.

A little later, I had the Prime Rib. It too was simply amazing. The prime was cooked to perfection and the auju was simmering hot and helped savor the succulent juices. I thought the wood place mate on the bar was a classy touch too.

I'd been there most of the day now  watching Family Feud, NCIS, Kelly & Michael and even Hoda and Kathy Lee. What a terrific day of \"day drinking\".

The place is special and the regulars are nice too. One guy in particular talked my ear off - can't remember his name though.

Overall, my experience was  terrific. The food was delectable and the ambiance was very nice. But by far the most compelling draw is the staff -especially the barmaid. She was efficient, sincere, humorous, attentive, witty, charming, - a little flirtatious and cute as a bugs ear.

Will I return?

Absolutely and so should you."}
{"text":"Legit fish fry on Fridays!! This place has a cozy atmosphere and very professional staff. I defenitely recommend the fish fry on either Tuesdays or Fridays."}
{"text":"We were here for a reception type B day party next door. I came into the bar to get more drinks. 

The Bar was all regulars and that was cool, everyone knew everyone. The bar tender was awesome, kept nice convo and kept the drinks full. 

The restaurant was def outdated but looked to have some great specials. I think there is a fish fry Fridays... may have to check it out."}
{"text":"Favorite are the beer battered chicken strips with a side of fries ! Great food quality. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Ironworks is a great spot after a nice 18 holes.  Exactly what you would expect, but a gem in the middle of the North Valley."}
{"text":"Best Friday fish fry I have found in the valley!  Very much like a good Wisconsin or Minnesota fish fry... Great tasting and crispy breading.  All you can eat in some places doesn't mean anything because you don't want to eat any more, but here it is great because the fish is so good.  Friendly and attentive wait staff always make it a pleasure.  I drive 45 mins-1 hour from Gilbert on average 1-2 Fridays/ month to have the fish fry."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite weekend karaoke spot. The staff is fantastic and remembers our names and drink orders the minute we walk in. Very family like establishment."}
{"text":"Wait staff rude. Going to go see a manager tomorrow. Paid for our food but waitress said we didn't so we paid again.  Food ok."}
{"text":"Very Friendly service food was ok! Football on Sundays and drink specials for two ppl drinks included paid less than 35.00"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast today, food was great! Service was terrible, the waiter charged my friend for 2 poached eggs that were over poached on her eggs Benedict to begin with, he also charged me for a 'splash' of orange juice with my vodka soda, which he stated 'I think she put a splash in there' it was clearly clear. We might go back for the food but not sit in the lounge, they need better staff with more knowledge of customer service."}
{"text":"First part of December went to this place to have a fish fry. Thin, over breaded and burned.  Very disappointed. Cannot believe that a manager would allow something like that go out of his kitchen. Will never go again ."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Ironworks for the first time today. The staff was very friendly and efficient. The food was fresh and delicious. Our waitress Tammy was friendly and spent time talking with us about the menu and other activities. We'll be going back!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try for the Friday Night Fish Fry after watching the yelp reviews. Pulled up at 6:30 and a line so it must be the real deal.  Gave my name to the hostess and told maybe a 15 minute wait which was perfect as my son and his friend would not arrive till then. 45 minutes passed and I checked with the hostess as I am noticing a few groups being seated who arrived after me. This time the hostess was not the young girl who took my reservation but an older lady who advised me I had a long wait as I was last on the list and at least 6 groups ahead of me. Some how they must have made a mixup but I would not mind the wait as it must be good. Finally 8:10 pm we are seated and quickly served water and menus. I asked about the fish and was told it was all you can eat Fresh Alaskan Pollack, Cole Slaw and French Fries for $9.95. Alaskan Pollack is not too bad white fish, similar to cod where it's namesake Atlantic Pollack is not the same species and is somewhat a slim white fish with color close to the skin and an off flavor, mostly ground and used in fish sticks and imitation crab. While the fish was cooked nicely and the french fries crisp, the fish was not Alaskan Pollock and had the off taste of its namesake from the Atlantic. Service was scatter brained from the hostess mixup to the server who had the memory of a gnat and took us the last 15 minutes to get our check. Just by the sheer number of guests I think I just hit them on a bad night and maybe their fish provider made a mistake this week. I will head back to the Peoria Cafe for my fish next Friday as it is always good but I can't help myself to try new Friday night fish fry's over the Valley."}
{"text":"We love coming here for breakfast on Saturday. Annessa is the best! Food is great service is better!"}
{"text":"Went in for prime rib last night and was not disappointed. Food and service were both wonderful."}
{"text":"I always come here because it's one of the least busiest breakfast places however the service is TERRIBLE. We gave ourselves two hours before my sons game to eat breakfast and we barely made it on time to his game! I got the eggs Benedict and the eggs were over cooked and cold. It's also expensive for not so great tasting good. I love the view and sitting on the patio but so not worth the service. Also, I'm pregnant and my sense of smell is very good right now and the inside smelt so bad, I couldn't walk through it without gagging. I never noticed that before so I'll blame the pregnancy this time."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with some coworkers, to gossip and catch up.  The place was pretty clean, and decently welcoming.  Very spacious but the lighting is quite dark. 

Service was slow, but the server was friendly, kind and attentive.  Took forever for them to order our food and deliver our checks.  

The loo was quite dated...well I guess it matches the building.  It wasn't very clean, and I was afraid to do a two in there.

The food was okay, and the portions were great.  Not bad quality, but far from great.  I ordered their meatloaf, my coworkers ordered the chop liver... and I did not wanted to try that.  They stated it was pretty decent. 

Overall a good experience, don't see why I wouldn't want come back."}
{"text":"This restaurant supports the community and I am glad to be a patron...the food is good, a bit dated but that's ok!"}
{"text":"Great views of the water and the greens from the restaurant.  Also, really good food.  Had that San Francisco thing and it was very tasty. Our service was good too... and prices were fair.  The decor is a bit out dated but everything was clean and taken care of.  I'll be back and might even try golfing here."}
{"text":"I went here for a birthday party last night and was pretty underwhelmed. First of all, when we got here this place was SLAMMED, like no room to breath because of their fish fry and Lent (I guess?) and most of the clientele were older people. As the night went on, the crown thinned. I didn't eat the food, so I can't comment on that, but I had a few drinks. At the beginning of the night, the drinks were not very good and hard to come by. They did get a little better (could be based on my choices... started with a tequila sunrise that wasn't so good, but later got a coffee with Bailey's which I liked). The best part was the price, very inexpensive with drinks costing about 5$ a piece. So, this was just kind of okay. My main complaint was the karaoke. They clearly had favorites and picked the same names over and over while others didn't get to sing at all. We were a large party and were dropping serious money here, so I thought they would be a bit more welcoming and fair with our group. I get that they have regulars, but still not a good excuse. I can't say that I would come back here unless invited by someone else."}
{"text":"Used to just hit the bar after playing a round. Was always an inexpensive place to grab a drink in the area.   Then we tried the food and we have not had a bad meal yet.  Last week we took the kids and parents here for a multi generational meal and it was great.  The place was quiet which usually means over priced or bad food but everyone enjoyed their meal.  So we went back to see if it was a fluke but it was another hit.  Not sure why this place isn't busier.....it should be.  Audrey is a great bartender, server and who knows what else she does in that place but she is always there.  The decor is a bit dated but as long as the food is not, then it's up there in my book."}
{"text":"Nice view of the golf course. I think I might want to come back and eat outside on the patio. The food is not great but not bad either. The prime rib was overcooked and the meatloaf was bland. I can't say more than it was just average and a bit meh on the food in a nice environment. The bar looks fun with all the activities and karaoke. I might go back because it is near where I live. However, I would not seek it out either."}
