{"text":"Two stars b/c Sara our server was uber-professional and spot-on. It started off with the dual hostesses pointing our 6 top group to a booth in front of the door on a freezing night but the table across the aisle had 6-8 coats hanging on the hooks for our booth and we couldn't get in. We asked for another table and were treated like idiots for even asking such a stupid question. After openly scoffing and scowling at us we got another table. Right next to a group of a dozen 7-8 year olds who had no adult supervision and ran around screaming and throwing shit around the room. We actually pulled our tables back from them to give them more running room. After all this crap the food came out and was  - meh.....
Our server was great to us and embarrassed for the restaurant itself...
Stay away from this place...there a ton of better places in the Waterfront"}
{"text":"Delicious. Absolutely delicious. The bacon mac & cheese was absolutely to die for. Such a simple dish, cooked to perfection. Well done"}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch and was seated right away. This is my go to place for a quick meal. I've been back a couple of times and the service/food never fail. I ordered the chicken fried chicken, and bourbon pecan pie for dessert. Both tasted amazing!!!! The waiter kept on checking to see if everything was going well, and made sure I had everything that I needed. This place deserve a better rating! So, I hope my 5 stars will help :)"}
{"text":"First time I was here I had chicken quesadilla's and they were bad.  We went again last weekend. I had the chicken avacod sandwich.  It was very good.  No fat in the chicken.  Just a mess to eat, but still awesome.   Also had the chocolate stout cupcake, it was amazing."}
{"text":"This is my 'tried and true' place whenever guests come into town.  Good food, good beer, good ambience.  The pub tips with mashed potatoes are very good!  I have heard that their classic mac n' cheese is quite good.  I love their stout, but it isn't for everyone.  The ambience isn't too loud so you can here what your friends are saying.  Staff is friendly.  Indoor and outdoor seating.  Nothing bad to say about this place."}
{"text":"The whole experience was good. Nothing wrong with the beer, food, or service. The portion was actually big enough for two people but the bill was a little on the pricey side."}
{"text":"The first time we went to Rock Bottom (how fitting a name), the hostess sat us next to a table with three screaming kids right next to where the servers enter and exit the kitchen. The waiter came by after a few minutes, took our drink order and then actually snatched the menus out of hands. He brought us our drinks and promptly walked away. The floor manager came by and we told her what happened. She reprimanded the waiter in front of us and gave us two discount cards for our next visit and comped our beers. The food wasn't great by any stretch of the imagination. So little so that I don't remember what we ordered.

We decided to use our discount cards for a second trip. We were sat once again in a far corner by the kitchen. The waiter took our drink order and food order together and instead of bringing out our drinks and then our food, just waited until our food was done cooking to bring out the drinks as well. I ordered the lobster enchiladas which was about $18 (US) because on the menu it sounded tasty. On the plate it looked like a used deflated diaper. The enchiladas were TINY. I asked the waiter if that was what it was supposed to look like because it didn't look like $18 worth of food. The chef that made it came out with an attitude and said, \"You should have asked about the portion before we wasted all that lobster.\" To which I responded, \"What lobster? There isn't a lobster tank in here which means you pulled it from a can.\" I have never been treated so rudely. The floor manager apologized however refused to defuse our anger because the previous manager comped our beers and gave us $20 off our next meal which he felt was more than kind enough a gesture.

So if you want Rock Bottom quality food with Rock Bottom service at sky high prices then this is your stop. For those of you who read this review this far: NOT A WORD OF THIS HAS BEEN EXAGGERATED. We are never coming back here.
Right across the parking lot are better places with better food on similar menus, The Keg, BJ's, and Wolfley's."}
{"text":"Let me just say, the5 times that I have been here, I have LOVED it!

Went here for the first time with my boyfriend. We went during the week, and they had some kind of trivia going on(it was pretty fun & entertaining) For an appetizer, my boyfriend ordered a caesar salad, which was really good! I ordered chicken quesadillas which were MIND BLOWING!! I mean OMG, they were soooooo good! I had never eaten sour cream or avocado before that night, and now I eat it all the time when I get the quesadillas.  Next, my boyfriend ordered a burger(with cheese, ketcup and mustard. PLAIN I know.) He ordered steak fries that came out more like potato wedges. He thought his burger was so-so. I tasted it, and it was dry and overcooked. The wedges were salty as well. 

I ordered a steak(medium well) and fries. Now that was 10 times better than my boyfriends plain burger. My steak was juicy, seasoned well, and cooked to perfection. I couldn't have asked for a better steak! So kudos to the cook! My fries were normal fries which were just as tasty(once again better than my boyfriends) lol.

I have been back to Rock Bottom 4 times since then, and now that I live up the street from it, I plan on becoming a weekly regular! I always get the chicken quesadillas, and have even tried the chicken nachos. Let me tell you that the nachos coming in a heap PILED up on a plate, with cheese, olives, tomatoes, and other stuff. They were sooooo good! Me and my friends couldn't eat it all.

Also, my boyfriend ordered the ribs before, and he did not like them WHAT-SO-EVER. But then again, he was comparing them to the ribs at Firebirds so yea. He also ordered the cheese pizza, and I must say that I have gotten better pizza at chuckie-cheese. I don't know if my boyfriend just has a string of bad luck at ordering at Rock Bottom, but his food is NEVER as good as mines. I have ordered the burger before(cheese, ketchup, mustard, lettuce, bbq sauce, medium well) and it was DELISH!

I recommend Rock Bottom to everyone to try out for themselves!"}
{"text":"This was the first venue I hosted a meetup.com event at... it was my first time there and they provided our group with excellent customer service.  In addition, I was pleasantly surprised to find the healthful food items on the menu.  Now I can send clients and friends interested in healthier eating to Rock Bottom Brewery!

Great atmosphere.  Upbeat.  They accommodated our group of 16 and were cool with the fact that we didn't even order too much.  We did try the edamame and multiple fish dishes.  These are new items... go try them! 

I was impressed and will be back.  You don't always have to go just for the beer!"}
{"text":"Its not bad. I'm not into chain kind of places, but if you're with a group that doesn't do anything more adventurous, you'll do fine here. I vacillated between 2 and 3 stars but the house beer I had will make sure I come back from time to time."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and prompt, but the food is clearly made in some massive off site kitchen and then frozen and shipped (unfortunately, most restaurants are doing this nowadays). This is basically a glorified Applebees, but if you need a place to get a beer and some simple appetizers, or if you love fat and salt, a good bet. They do have a good beer selection and sitting at the bar can be interesting, but every bar is interesting."}
{"text":"Our first time visit today. Food was very good and service was great. !"}
{"text":"I would have to say I'm pretty partial to Rock Bottom, I have been going almost every Thursday for the past 3 years because of the fantastic \"Team Trivia\". My friends and I love the atmosphere, the DJ (Todd), and the service that we get at Rock Bottom. 

Every week when we go a menu is never needed because we pretty much know everything we want on it, except for when the change the menu from time to time and we get to have a special treat with something new! 

As an avid Rock Bottomer, hands down I have never in my life had a better spicy spinach cheese dip than I have had here at Rock Bottom. Whether I have eaten dinner or not before I come down to the restaurant, my favorite and my food of choice is the ENORMOUS Ball park pretzels with the cheese dip. It is a meal itself! The mixture of onions, cheese, spinach and tomatoes is perfection! 

Another favorite of mine is the Barbecue Chicken Pizza, it has a great kick to it and it's big enough for two people. 

The service has always been super great and now since we go often we have developed a great relationship with some of the wait staff. 

A truly great place to have fun with friends and meet new people! 

Come to Team Trivia every Thursday at 8pm!"}
{"text":"Place has the best fresher brewed beer in town . Great customer service we are regulars here love this place . Happy hour specials are really good nice clean and friendly environment . Recommend it to any one looking for a place to enjoy a nice cold beer and catch a game or just hang out with family or friends ."}
{"text":"Nice place good food but only 4 stars because the service was subpar. Our waiter seemed annoyed by something. Maybe we just caught him on a bad day. Would come back again though."}
{"text":"First time eating here and checking place out. Everything exceeded expectations. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The artichoke and crab dip was to die for. The server even brought us more dipping crackers before we even had to ask her to. Same with drink refills. Always nice when you do not have to ask. Food was just as ordered. Everything was excellent. Would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went last night with in-laws for mother in laws bday.We always have loved the place and it is our go to place when we have something to celebrate and even when we don't.  Walked right in, we're seated, server was pleasant. Mentioned it was for mother in laws birthday and she was nice about it.

Ordered drinks and an appetizer. ..This is where things went slightly pear shaped. Server came back and told us the appetizer was delayed. No big beal, things happen. 

Food comes and as always, was completely wonderful. Chicken fried chicken for three of us and my wife had the sizzling peppers. More pear shaped, waitress was no where to be found for 20 minutes. Wife was out of beer and spicy food minus drink.....she waited. Finally I got up and had to get another server to get a refill. She started with \"I am not your server....\" but said she would take care of it. To her credit she did. 

Manager comes over, very nice, apologized for the appetizer and days she will cover it. Server shows up and is rather standoffish. Not rude per se but moody. Not sure if it was my stunt with the beer or the manager but either way not our fault. More waiting for desert, more drinks, something and then the server does show up with the bill no questions asked, not a thing.

The rating is not for the appetizer,  like I said things happen. It was not for the lack of drinks, it was for the apathy. At least come by and check on us, tell us the app is coming, but the server seemed to say, \"the app screwed my tip so why try\". If the place was hopping I would get it, but it was early afternoon. 

Anyway long story short: great food, apathetic service, use to be a go to place even with the hour drive but we may
 be finding another one."}
{"text":"Slow service
Below average food 
Ill pass"}
{"text":"Service is good, staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Beer and cocktails are good as well. Food...not so much.  My boyfriend and I shared the Jalapeno Pretzel appetizer which was pretty good, but our entrees.... disappointing.  I got the Baja chicken sandwich and he got the bison burger.   both were super dry. i could not even finish half of mine. He had to drench his in ketchup to be able to get the bison burger down. If i were to go back, it certainly would not be to eat."}
{"text":"I tried the pulled pork BBQ sandwich tonight and I'm very sorry about the choice. It has to be the worst BBQ sandwich I've had in 32 years in the Carolinas. The meat was saturated in a cloying nauseatingly sweet sauce. I should have sent the plate back, but I was very hungry and just ate it.  You know, it tasted like what a person up North thinks a BBQ sandwich should be.  ICK!"}
{"text":"These burgers were all ordered medium. One is pretty much completely raw. Everything else we had was just okay. Drink specials are nice, but would not recommend the food."}
{"text":"The beer is good. Their light beer, Lumpy Dog, is very good-- doesn't taste like a light beer. When I was pregnant I became quite a fan of their root beer floats, too.

As others have noted, the pretzels are really good. I'm not a fan of the spinach dip but my husband likes it. Veggie burgers are always good, too, though the staff sometimes seems confused when you order, say, the bourbonzola burger with a veggie burger. Long, long ago, when I used to go to the Rock Bottom in Boston, there was a hot mushroom / sundried tomato / cheese dip on the menu that was fantastic... if they resurrect that I will gladly add another star!"}
{"text":"This is a place that is good for both family and date night. We usually order the bourbon salmon, so good, always perfectly cooked with really good smokey flavor and of course the bourbon sauce is amazing. My kids usually order the self made pizza, they have fun making and eating the food."}
{"text":"The beer was pretty good, but the food was a real disappointment.
I have always enjoyed the beer at Rock Bottom and miss their location in Atlanta (Buckhead).
We sent back the guacamole because it was warm from sitting under a heat lamp.
I had the pizza and it was mediocre at best.  The wings were fine, but nothing special.  The restaurant was busy, but wasn't packed.   Our food took a long time to come out.  We were sitting near the kitchen and could see a number of items sitting under the heat lamps for 15 minutes.  It seemed like the kitchen was putting the food out fast enough, but the servers weren't getting the food to the tables."}
{"text":"I'd have to say it was no where near an awesome experience. We tried to order a pitcher of the IPA and the waitress stops us and is like do you like IPAS? do you know what your ordering? i was like yes i like IPAS im capable of ordering a beer like a grown up. maybe next time be like hey our ipa is exceptionally hoppy compared to other ipas, is that alright for you? After finally ordering a pitcher of beer (there were six of us, so four of us had one beer) the waitress tells us that it is such a high gravity, she says 9% that if any of us have more than three she'll have to start figuring out who the DD is and maybe cut people off. Not only was it an uncomfortable comment, but we looked back at the menu and the beer was only 5.7%. Needless to say none of us wanted to order another round of drinks. Then when the waitress brought out our chili, she told us that the green onions looked nasty and she didn't feel comfortable serving them. I was kind of grossed out by that point. Couldn't you have just lied to me and told me you were out? I don't wanna hear about nasty things in the kitchen, it made me really not want to eat. Luckily the food was good, however the service was reason enough not to return."}
{"text":"I like the food and atmosphere of RB, but the service here...well....I felt like I was in a High School popularity contest. The waitress was blond and maybe \"thought\" her looks can justify her business sense. We sat down and in a typical fashion engage by ordering an app and our meals. We felt as though we may have been interupting her day, and this was evident when she forgot our appetizer and when she brought our bill (which was the only real time she acted like she cared). On her way out to bring our bill, she stopped at another table and conversed and gave them great attention for some time, then brought our bill and essentially dropped it off (great way to maximize your tip girl). I could not wait to get out of there which is too bad, but I like the place overall. BTW we made no advances or said anything that would make her feel uncomfortable, but she made us feel uncomfortable....too bad because we ususally give a \"MIMINUM\" 20% tip......read up restaurant staffs all over, if not for caring about anyone else, at least be nice for the tip........................."}
{"text":"Eating out is always a challenge with two kids under 5. However, the folks at this location make it easy and enjoyable, EVERYTIME!! We keep going back because our service is always that good and if course the happy hour is the best! Even when we've had rough service due to short staff or whatever, the sever recognizes that and offers to make it right! Love it and since kids live it, we will continue to go back!"}
{"text":"Our lunch was great here! Pizza/salad combo was delicious and good price. Lots of food for the price! Bartender was also our waitress, professional, nice looking, great service!"}
{"text":"Love the environment. All the craft beers are awesome! Food was great..
Will be back.."}
{"text":"This place was just awesome. The waitress was super nice. The food was very great. Everyone was happy with what they had. Chicken sandwich, pulled pork sandwich, and a chicken salad. Amazing nachos - they are huge! Would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to this place...used to have what I'd consider to be a creative menu and atmosphere, but it feels a bit dated now and doesn't seem to have evolved mucb. I actually worked at this location in about 2003, and remember what great energy this place used to have. As I write this my daughter and I just finished a very mediocre meal, and 1 server appears to be running the entire dining side...and taking his time at that. I've been done with my meal for over 20 minutes...and just need the dang check. I'll be handing him the card as soon as he brings it, God forbid I take a moment to review the bill and then need to wait 20 more minutes for him to return."}
{"text":"I visited around 2 p.m. on a Friday afternoon. The place was not busy.  Many empty tables.  I ordered Jambalaya. It was warm and  good tasting.  Dessert was great.  Staff was friendly.  Enviroment was pleasant.  It took awhile for me to get my food.  I ordered coffee and I had to wait to get a refill.  They had enough help in my opinion. Waiting to get my order is the reason I did not give a five star rating.  I will come back and eat here again."}
{"text":"Ridiculous happy hour! Good beer. Service kind of lacks here and food outside of happy hour is kind of expensive. Anyways I would go again but Im not gonna go out of my way to come here"}
{"text":"Simply awful. They try but not hard enough. Junk. Go elsewhere. Bravo next door is a much better option."}
{"text":"I had the Rock Bottom Ale chicken tonight and it was a very large portion and delicious. Our server Rebecca tonight was exceptional. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I like the Glendale location better. However, I was here the other day (again with kiddo and hubby in tow) as I was craving fish tacos and thought I might find some good ones here. I guess the fish tacos they used to have on the menu all the time are gone, but thankfully they were having some sort of seafoody promotiony thingy. I ordered them beer battered and fried (grilled fish tacos at a brewery? Seriously?) and they hit the spot. Im not sure I would call the sauce on them a \"slaw\" but it was just lovely anyway, and the fish portions were huge and tasted pretty fresh! Hubby had the onion soup which he says is not as salty as it was before (its a good thing) and The Kid ate every freakin black bean off of my plate. Yay."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks, atmosphere, & staff. I recommend the jalapeño burger. It's my favorite! Other dishes are great, but I'm stuck on that burger! Always had good waitresses especially Olivia & Amina. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Floor was sticky, menus were sticky, seats were dirty, and when we sat at our booth there was a weird non appetizing smell. The host took several minutes to come to the host stand and take us to our seats. Needless to say, we were not happy and left."}
{"text":"Bad service and mediocre food served cold.  If you have a large group and want to get together for lunch you would be better off bringing a bag lunch and meeting in a park. 

 We made reservations but it took 30 minutes for our order to be taken and the food didn't show until an hour later at which point we all had to get back to work. And, the food was cold.

The kicker is that this  wasn't the first time this has happened.  A few weeks ago we all got exactly the same horrible level of service with cold mediocre food.

If I could give negative star rating I would."}
{"text":"I would rate it as average. I would rather suggest you go to the yardhouse and spend the same for better food and service. Food is average service is not do good. Rating 2 and half."}
{"text":"We had the worst experience at this place! It ruined our first visit in Charlotte. Their service was horrible and I would never go to any Rock Bottom!"}
{"text":"This place was one of those that kept impressing me. I had the chicken stuffed peppers-awesome, Kathy had a personal pizza-awesome, Tori had bacon mac and cheese-again awesome. To drink a had the 6  sample flight of micro beers-good to see 3/4 full juice glasses and not just a shot glass amount like so places. Kathy had a margarita also very good. To finish we had toffee cheese cake in a mason jar-killer and coffee. The waitstaff was good, bathroom clean, good room temp and loved seeing the vats for making their own micro beer."}
{"text":"ok, i went for food, not alcohol. i loved this place. it's a very cool atmosphere. there's a great bar area with tvs and is set up nicely, classy, but casual. the restaurant is separate also with tvs. hands down, my chicken fried chicken meal was one of the top 5 meals i've ever eaten. i've been to restaurants all over this country, and this entire meal was beyond good. everything was so good and melted in my mouth. we ordered an appetizer of wings and they were good as well. my boyfriend ordered a steak and loved his entire meal too. they offer reduced priced appetizers mon-fri until 6 or 7pm. there is always something i'm dissatisfied with a meal whether it be a lack of sauce, no flavor, poor quantity. this meal was outstanding. get the chicken fried chicken with mashed potatos. you won't be disappointed. for anyone who likes microbeers, they have a large selection. great service. all around loved everything about the food, service, and ambiance. they are also on restaurant.com.  you can spend $35 on your meal and get $25 off your bill. great place and i can't wait to go back. we also got this dessert called a peanutbutter shooter. it was only $2.50. this dessert was soooo good. it was like whipped peanut butter with chocolate on it. melts in your mouth and leaves you wanting more and more."}
{"text":"Great bar. Great atmosphere. Great food. Cool place to be.

Definitely one of those places you could keep going back just because it's so chill and it's a great place for friends to just enjoy some drinks and eat some good food. Nothing too too spectacular by any means but satisfies the taste buds. Their apps are the best part and the highlight of the restaurant, in my opinion. The nachos can be split among 4-5 people easy. Lots of toppings and yummy all around."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were part of a friend's birthday party of about 12 adults on a Thursday night. It was not especially crowded (no wait) and we had reservations.
1. Nobody took our drink orders or brought us water for over 20minutes.
2. When they brought out all the appetizers, ours was not among them, because it was never put in. When it finally came out, it was clear the nachos were rushed and they were not especially good.
3. When the entree came out, we were brought the incorrect dish, at this point I had more than enough of the place, so I told them to forget about it and bring the check.
4. Everyone had finished their meals for nearly an hour before the checks were sporadically brought out. After all the checks were brought out, we had to pull the waitress aside and specifically ask for her to bring ours.
5. During this whole time, there was no one who looked like a manager to be found. Everyone at the table was clearly upset by the service, yet management never showed its face.

This was, by far, the worst dining experience I have ever been a part of and I would not recommend this overrated establishment to anyone."}
{"text":"went there for a bday party. it was a great new experience to sit at the pour your own tap table. check it out is was different and great. you wont find anything else like it in town"}
{"text":"Just had a couple beers and some appetizers since it was late.

The rock bottom ipa is a fairly decent ipa compared to the numerous I have tasted. Just had the one beer though so can't speak to the rest of there drafts.

The chicken quesadilla and the ahi appetizers were very good. The ahi was a sushi type appetizer with a soy based sauce, garnish, and chop sticks. The quesadilla was good and I had no complaints about it. Service was good for a Sunday night and they are open late. Kitchen closes about 11 though. 

I will be coming back."}
{"text":"We went to Rock Bottom for the first time last night (date night). We had excellent food and the service was amazing. Our waitress explained all the beers, rec. food, and even threw in dessert on the house. We had a blast and can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I've been here once before and the service and food was awesome so today for Valentine's Day I wanted to go there with my fiancé. This service was not good at all. As we sat there getting terrible service we watched all the other tables getting excellent service. Our server in particular did not seem experienced at all. She almost dropped my fiancé food on him when setting it on the table and never once came back to check on us. As for a food it was not at all what I experienced before. Over cooked steak. Weird Mac n cheese. But anyway, the wonderful manager Scott Lancaster ending up comping our entire bill and we were not expecting that at all. Greatly appreciated. He's the only reason I would return."}
{"text":"There's nothing wrong with this place, but there's nothing exceptional either.  The patio is a nice place to hang out and the beer is good, not phenomenal, but good.
  
Paying 10 dollars for a burger was a bit steep, but it was tasty enough that combined with the company I wasn't too disappointed.  
So far after two trips there I would say it's an average  place to get something predictably good and a beer to go with it.

I don't really have anything negative to say about this place, but nothing superlative either, it seems like it's a good place for the nights you want something you don't have to think too hard about.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"We came here after the other places we wanted to go to were packed, and it was a good decision. This place was really good, and the atmosphere was nice, and the waiter was on top of everything. The food arrived, and there were no issues, and it was delicious. I usually don't eat fish and chips, but it was really good. I would suggest coming here"}
{"text":"NO LONGER THE SAME RESTAURANT. 

I can't begin to say how disappointed and, frankly, angry I am with the Rock Bottom Brewery in Homestead. We came to love the Rock Bottom chain in Chicago for their energetic and well-trained staff, high-quality craft beers, and excellent food. Not haute cuisine, of course, but some very tasty and inventive recipes across a solid range of American, Italian and Tex-Mex varieties -- consistently good, regardless of which franchise we happened to be eating at. So it was with real delight that we discovered a Rock Bottom in Pittsburgh when we moved here several years ago. Same quality staff, same quality beers, same quality food, and all in a perfect location at the Homestead Waterfront. We began frequenting this establishment on a regular basis, at least once a month. 

But that all changed in 2016, with the hiring of a new manager and the radical turnover of waitstaff - and I would assume kitchen staff. While they carry the same menu, this store is definitely NOT following the same recipes, not training their staff in the same way, and not maintaining the same quality of craft brewing. The wait staff are dull and bored, the food is dull and boring and is NOT prepared according to the recipes listed on the menu, while only the beer remains relatively passable. In short, this restaurant was taken over by someone with zero commitment to maintaining the same standards of quality food, training, and organization represented by the rest of the chain, and seems hellbent on reducing the store to the same level of mediocrity found throughout the Pittsburgh region. This restaurant was GREAT, but they are killing it. If you're at the Waterfront, don't waste your time going there. Longhorn Steakhouse and PF Changs are vastly superior options."}
{"text":"Okay food nothing special. Brushetta chicken dry and not much flavor.  Beer was good!"}
{"text":"Wow went there with a frend from out of town after how many years and finally got a tour of the brewery. Great people and great service !! My waitress was Morgan with a great attitude and great smile. Even got some FREE pork wings and and a glass of free beer. Food was timely and delicious. Not an empty seat on a thursday I guess the food is that good!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Rock Bottom Brewery last night for the first time and we had a WONDERFUL experience! Our server, Amanda, was very attentive, and was able to make several good beer recommendations to my husband. My husband said that his burger was the best one he'd ever had, and my pizza was delicious! Prices weren't too bad either, especially considering how amazing the food and the service was. Rock Bottom is now on our list of favorite local restaurants and we will definitely be visiting it again in the future!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had had a dinner here. Our first time at this establishment. It was awesome! Service was very good and the burgers were oh-my-god-don't-even-get-me-started great! I also had the Rocktoberfest Red Ale and was the best RED ale I've had. And A okay on food and service and a thumbs up on their brews!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here a lot lately and the food is consistently good. Their burgers are great (especially the 2:00 am burger) and the staff is always friendly. I haven't tried too many of their beers but the food will keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed to say this place has gone down hill. While my boyfriend and I use to really enjoy coming here, the food has gotten considerably worse. They've taken many things off the menu we use to enjoy, such as the pretzel sticks with beer cheese, and replaced them with frozen ballpark pretzels and nacho cheese. Tonight I ordered a steak salad, of which the steak was good, but there was nothing on the salad that was listed on the menu. Not to mention the whole place smells smells like dirty mop water. The beer is still very good, that's why still gave them 2 stars."}
{"text":"yumm yumm yumm... Rock Bottom has some great food and the atmosphere is really cool. I love the fact that you can view the brewery and the beer sampler was fantastic! I don't have one bad thing to say about this place. Every one was very nice, they gave us time to actually enjoy our appetizer before our entrees came, and the food tasted absoutely amazing! I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible food. No flavor. Took over an hour for the food to get there. Waiter was perfect and he felt bad got us the manager and she comp. our food and our drinks but we had to kinda make a big deal bc she didn't want to comp anything at all. She wanted us to get something else but i didn't want to wait another hour for food. She then gave us 2 complementary dinners for our next time there. But I won't be going back any time soon... I have never complained to a manager in my life so this is a big deal for me."}
{"text":"Loved the American Blonde and gram's oat soda IPA.  Good service.    Egg rolls were very good.  Our bar tender was very attentive and helpful in selecting the beers."}
{"text":"Was in with a party of 10 and walked out after waiting for 25mins just to place a food order.  Figured we didn't want to risk a long wait for the food. Nobody tried to even convince us to stay. 2nd time service was extremely slow.   Seems to be a pattern. 

Went across the street to Duckworth's who took great care of us."}
{"text":"The wait time was shorter than expected. The service was fast and great. We had the El Diablo pizza and 2am burger which were both tasty. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The food was rock bottom. 

It was so disappointing that  me and two my friends could not finish our meals."}
{"text":"I've only eaten at Rock Bottom a few times but once again, I am very disappointed in the quality of the food. However, this time even my \"craft\" beer was disappointing. I chose a red ale that should have been clear and bright but instead looked like chocolate milk! Apparently it had been drawing cloudy for a few days, but \"don't worry, it should taste fine!\" Um, no, I don't think so.
As for my ribeye steak? Medium rare yes, but riddled with gristle and inedible. The  mashed potatoes were whipped to a starchy goo and the asparagus stringy and overlooked. 
Our waitress was a sweetheart and did her best to make things right but in the end could only wish me a happy birthday and hope my day improved."}
{"text":"Came in with a buddy of mine to a familiar place that always delivers during my travels. We sat down, not too many clients in the restaurant and service started out well with our server Imani. However, it became evident that either we were placed in a section different from the areas she was working as we kept seeing her less and less or I can just ignore my guest because I think I'm cute and smile and everything will be okay. At the end of our meal, which was very good, she offered us dessert, we opted for another beer which never came. We would catch a glance here and there of her for the next 20 minutes and finally she came over and asked if I beer made it to us. Did you bring me my drink? Then no, I have not gotten my beer. She would look for it right away, but I asked her to just close us out as it just wasn't nice to be there any longer, no excuse, no apology, just said okay, smiling away and walked away to what I hoped would be a quick return with my bill. She again left for another 10 minutes. When she returned I asked her what exactly happened that our drinks never made it to us? Was someone else supposed to bring it, did she forget? She said that someone else usually brings it, she was helping out the bar by bringing our drinks, someone must have taken it, oh my god, i'll just smile at these guys and everything will be fine.... no.... i just want good service. The server who was on our side was taking care of all his clients, bringing them drinks so im pretty sure I was getting the run around. I asked her who the manager was and she said Michael and again walked away. Pretty disrespectful attitude to have in a customer service environment. Next time I come to Charlotte I need to stick to the many many other places with great food and folks that want to take care of their clients. My opinion is that the food here was darn good and consistent, the beer is excellent, the service which is the most important, was \"rock bottom\"."}
{"text":"Perfect. Food was perfectly cooked. Great brews. Nice atmosphere. Reasonable prices. Loved our waitress, Alex. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Was hoping for a great end of a day experience, but...... Things happen. Waitress seemed to have forgotten about us, entrees came out prior to our appetizers. Entree of fish &chips was a major disappointment, fish was soggy and the chips were cold and grainy.starters were comp'ed but I doubt we'd go back. Sad because it has the potential to be a home run hitter. Two stars and that's it."}
{"text":"We have ate here a few times, this visit was one of the worst experiences we have had in a long time.  The host who sat us (2+our baby) was very rude, acted like we were inconviencing him by coming in. (Took about 5 minutes before he even came to sit us).  He also clearly saw our baby however didn't offer a booster or a high chair.   He did however give us a kids coloring menu (but they don't have crayons??? Really?)  The waitress was also in some type of mood and for some reason decided to take a job at a brewery knowing nothing about beer.  I asked what wheat beers they had, she suggested a house beer---umm, not a wheat at all....food took about 30-40min after ordering to come...awesome with a restless baby and no crayons...  terrible experience (crappy employees, took to long, burger was really dry, waitress dosent know anout beers at a brewery, no crayons for their kids coloring menus)... ohh I also forgot to add the floors in the restaurant was disgusting, looked like it hadent been swept or moped in quite some time.....bathroom was much worse....   what a waste of a trip"}
{"text":"The bourbonzola burger is outstanding and I'm pretty sure they have a little old southern lady trapped on the kitchen because the chicken fried chicken is too notch!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here during a recent swing through Charlotte on biz. I was looking for an relaxed \"Pub-food-plus\" type of joint with good beer and in Rock Bottom, I found it. 

The bar staff was helpful and generous with samples from their 8ish original beers. The Brown Ale is delicious (and award winning) and my favorite of the group.

While Rock Bottom features beer, they hang their hat on food. The nachos were loaded with fixin's, and the chili is chunky and decidedly above-average. 

It's a relaxed, inviting and warm destination for anyone looking for an afterwork drink or evening out."}
{"text":"First, the positive.  The Brewmaster makes great beers. Love the Raptor Red which has been one of the brewmasters beers for years.  We go out with friends several times each week and love to enjoy our beers and have a nice conversation.  Now the negative. Our visit tonight was not the most enjoyable because the music was loud and not very enjoyable. Although a member of our party asked the manager and server if the volume could be turned down, if it was, it was not noticeable.  We go out often and like to go different places and enjoy microbrews.  We will try Rock Bottom again but if the music is an issue again we will not return.  What is it with loud music in these places anyway? It doesn't appear that anyone goes into establishments like this to listen to loud, disgusting music.  They appear to be out to socialize with others and enjoy food and a few drinks."}
{"text":"Service was great but food wasn't anything special. A little pricey. We will try a new place next time."}
{"text":"When I come to Charlotte downtown is always my first stop. The mac&cheese is the best! You have to try it! The service overall is okay and the drinks as well. The prices are descent but I love coming to Rock Bottom!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, drink was delicious but the service? Made the night magical. It was my husband's birthday and we had worked all day and just wanted a relaxed bite to eat with a locally brewed beer. Elizabeth was fun, friendly and full of things to recommend. Great place!  Great staff"}
{"text":"I went here tonight with my daughter.  It was quite busy and we were seated at a high standing type table immediately but they asked if that would be ok.  I ordered the Fish and Chips and my daughter had the Chicken Fried Chicken.   The Fish and Chips were average at best.   Small portions of both.  My daughter enjoyed the chicken fried chicken.  I had a homemade root beer and it was not very good.  It had a bad aftertaste in my opinion.   We had the brownie and ice cream for desert and it was good but nothing spectacular.   The host and our waitress were very friendly and engaging.   I had been there once before and had the best chicken pot pie I had ever had.  Overall the meal was OK.  I would probably call to see if they had the Chicken Pot pie again before going back.  I prefer BJ's on Northern and the 101."}
{"text":"Just got back from a week long trip to Charlotte with my girlfriend and of all the places we went to, this was our favorite by FAR.  EXCELLENT beer, food was delicious, steak cooked to perfection, wait staff was attentive and polite.  Just a great experience! If you're in Charlotte, got to Rock Bottom!!"}
{"text":"Mondays & Tuesdays, kids 12 & under eat free!

We really enjoy the kids-make your own pizza!  And the kids do too!  Our daughter has more fun making it!  Our son has more fun eating it, and his sister's left overs!"}
{"text":"This place is only good for it's beer. Their food is unimaginative and boring. Their hand crafted beer is where it's at. 

Brian Helton, their brewmaster, knows his stuff. He has some beer medals to prove it. The Roadrunner Porter, Raptor Red and Stout are some of the best beers of their style out there. Brian's seasonal brews are top notch as well. 
The wait staff is wish-washy on service. Bad nights are common, with slow service. 
I was a regular there for 4 years, so I had semi special treatment. 
Also, if you are in the service industry, this is the place for you. After 10pm, show your paystub or food handlers card, and get $2.25 pints. 

All in all, Great place to throw back some pints, and grab a snack. I wouldn't go there for just dinner."}
{"text":"My Husband and I took my son out for dinner and we all LOVED it!  My husband had the bacon mac and cheese. He said it was the best he had ever eaten!  My son at the veggie tacos and also loved them.  I had one of there salads and was very happy with what I received.  Our server went out of his way to make sure everything was the way we wanted it.  Looking forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"Happy hour at Rock Bottom, 2 thumbs up!  Good prices, the pizza is delicious, drinks are a few dollars off the regular price, good service, and the atmosphere is always casual and fun."}
{"text":"I had my baby shower here. The space very nice, staff friendly, and everyone loved the food, especially the chicken Mac n cheese! Everyone is still raving about it!"}
{"text":"waitress wasn't good with service.
mongolian beef dish sucks.
fish is just ok.
rock bottom is usually pretty good, but this one in scottsdale is not that great."}
{"text":"If you want excellent customer service and delicious Mac-n-cheese, look no further. My steak came out rare when I asked for medium and the waitress sent it back to cook longer. When she came back, I was pleasantly surprised with an entirely full entrée again.  Unfortunately it was under cooked again and the manager and waitress were very apologetic and offered to send it back again, but by this time I was already full. Now I'll have quite a yummy lunch tomorrow. This was my first time at this restaurant and I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This is literally the first place I went when I first came to Pittsburgh - and I loved it. Hearty, full-sized meals, lots to choose from, and not too crowded or noisy. Although, for the sake of full disclosure, I didn't sit at the bar and I don't drink alcohol so I can't comment on that. I go back to Pittsburgh often and Rock Bottom ends up being a good standby for a dinner and a movie kind of night. Really, I have no complaints about this place so I'm surprised by the few low ratings here."}
{"text":"On a long decline

To start, I'm a long time patron of the Rock Bottom chain, going back to the very first Walnut Brewery in Boulder in 1990.

This is a pale shadow. The beer is decent, but the food gets worse every year. Over-salted, dry, and the ingredients taste old. My wife and I used to come every weekend, but now we leave disappointed every time. We keep trying different things on the menu to see if we can find *something* that taste better than a Chilis, but to no avail.

Maybe it is just this location, but it used to be good, and the quality of the food is pretty bad. We probably won't eat here anymore, and the beer isn't distinct enough to pull us from the Yard House. Especially since they don't even use local names anymore, just the generic \"IPA\".

No character, low quality food prepared poorly, and even the beer has lost its edge (still not bad, just nothing distinct about it). Really no reason to go here anymore, which is too bad. There go nearly 15 years of loyalty..."}
{"text":"First, let's just just get this out of the way.  I actually really like Rock Bottom.  I have had great experiences at the Desert Ridge location, but I would definitely stay away from their Arrowhead restaurant.

Picture this: You walk in awaiting a night of splendor.  You already like Rock Bottom.  For all intents and purposes, the kill has already been made.  You are seated.  

Five minutes later, a chrome dome piece of crap waiter comes over (finally) and hovers directly over your table, making you feel slightly uncomfortable.  You contemplate a beer.  After all, it IS a brewery, right?  You present your ID.  Said waiter looks it over and tells you that he cannot accept a vertical ID.  Why, you ask?  Because they said so, that's why.  They only accept horizontal IDs.  The waiter then tells you that he just had to turn down the girl at the next table for the same reason.

You stop the manager (a tub of lard in horizontal stripes) and ask why a valid ID that does not expire until the dawn of the next millennium isn't good enough for Rock Bottom.  You are told, in an unbelievably condescending tone, that their corporate policy is more important than what state law says.  One nasty smirk later, and she leaves the table without another word.    Then you notice that the \"girl who was denied a drink\" is avidly enjoying a beer at the table beside you.  

I'm sure it was next to impossible for said waiter to manage BOTH of his tables at the same time, but we eventually got our check.  

Good food, shitty service, horrible management.  Stay away from this location (especially if you see Jabba the Hut on shift)."}
{"text":"Go here if you enjoy waiting in the lobby when there are tons of open tables and being rudely treated by the hostess!  The food is just ok bar food.  The beer is awesome I will admit and the servers are pretty attentive.  I would rather drive down to Myrtle beach or Atlanta to it's sister restaurant Gordon Biersch.  The food is much better and the people who work there will treat you much better.  If you really need to go there to enjoy the beer, I'd eat elsewhere and then just sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed this place. Nice location...Within walking distance for most of the center city hotels. Wide selection on the menu...definitely something for everybody (even picky little kids.) The Spiced Hefeweizen was amazing...finished very clean. If you have kids, avoid the Mac and Cheese on the kids menu...it's just Kraft. The wait staff was great; attentive but not overbearing.  Overall a good place to eat for a family staying in center city Charlotte."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite all-around restaurants. Good food, good service and it has a great atmosphere. Casual, but it is not too laid back. It is perfect for family and friends. It has great outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in here for lunch on our vacation after going to Discovery Place.The hostess greeted us with a smile and sat us down. The Waiter came over promptly and informed us that he would be with us in a moment.

He came over and brought us our drinks and was very friendly about suggestions for the menu (even though I took a while). My wife got the Mac n' Chicken, per his recommendation, while I had the Cajun Fish Tacos. 

Right off the bat just looking at the food was presented very nicely and prefessionally. 
The taste of the Mac n' Chicken was so flavorful. It was the perfect amount of creaminess, and the breadcrumb crust added a nice bit of texture to it. The chicken was perfectly juicy and seasoned well.

The Cajun Fish Tacos were perfectly flaky and seasoned to perfection with a sauce that was to die for, while the black beans and rice complimented it perfectly.

Our server Edmund was very friendly and promptly refilled our drinks whenever they were low, as well as checking on us to make sure our food was ok or if we needed anything from time to time. 

Overall this was a wonderful hole in the wall with amazing food and a friendly, casual atmosphere.
It really topped off our visit to Charlotte and definitely makes me and my wife want to come back"}
{"text":"Food is good, beer is amazing! Highly recommend stopping in if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I'm visiting Homestead this week for some work-related training.  Rock Bottom was recommended by the receptionist at my hotel, and I'm so glad it was!  I've been there twice already and will go back before I leave in a few days.  I sat at the bar during both of my visits, and the bartenders were both very nice...Bob during the day and Paul at night.  The pumpkin beer and milk stout are both awesome.  Like other reviewers stated, the nachos are great!  I think the best part was that everyone was very friendly.  Other customers seated at the bar were eager to chat, which is so nice when you don't know anyone in the area!  Great place!  Thanks for the hospitality!"}
{"text":"I went last night and had the blackened fish tacos.  They were delicious and the waitress had the cooks kick it up a notch for me on the spicy side. I thought that was nice that they let me customize the preparation to my liking."}
{"text":"Went to Rock Bottom on Martin Luther King Day with S to have a late lunch and catch up on my recent vacation.  Although a holiday, by close to 3pm the place was not overrun with patrons.  We stood in the entry and waited while several wait staff scurried by much to preoccupied to give us a glance; a host or hostess was nowhere to be found.  This continued for a good three minutes while we contemplated  the other choices in the Desert Ridge area.  Finally glancing over from the bar a good 50ft from the podium, the \"brew master\" came over and offered to seat us. 

We asked for a booth and as he began to lead us to the dining area, we passed booth after booth covered with dirty dishes from some \"rush\" that was not evident at this time in the afternoon...walking across the entire restaurant to place us at a booth on the back wall of the dining room.  Menus in hand, we were eventually greeted by our waiter who took our drink order...ice tea for me, diet coke for S.  The drinks were quickly brought and we were ready to place an appetizer order.  We were told he would be right back.  We sat and looked at the menu further while our waiter efficiently refilled the drinks of all of the tables in his charge.  After approximately 10 minutes he returned and took our appetizer order...we decided NOT to place our lunch order for fear everything would arrive at the same time as sometimes happens at Rock Bottom.

Joining us at surrounding tables were a man and woman, and another man, woman, and a toddler of about 4 in full ballet tutu with a long strand of beads who spent most of her time on the floor or underneath the table or wandering up and down the aisle completely unsupervised

The waiter then appeared with drink refills and to take our entrée order.  Being far from  crowded, our Titan Toothpick appetizer came up fairly quickly under the heat lamp.  After a couple of minutes, our waiter came over and said in a very authoritative voice...\"Your Toothpicks are up I see...be right back with those\". Being hungry and also seeing the order of toothpicks sitting there we waited in anticipation as he began once again to refill drink orders, one after the other, then began to clear a table, then two tables.  Several times he walked near the kitchen where our Toothpicks sat...but each time he would veer off in another direction.  Almost ten minutes passed and I wondered if we were to self-serve our own appetizers. Several of the other wait staff had been up to the counter, picked up their orders and left...Toothpicks still sitting when finally a nice well- meaning waitress took pity on us and brought them over.  Magically, our waiter appeared almost immediately to ask how they were.

We figured he was new and had not learned pacing or serving techniques, but still were hoping to salvage the rest of lunch.  About halfway through the Toothpicks...I saw our food appear under the heat lamp.  Hoping to finish our appetizer I was shot down when the same nice waitress delivered our entrées....our waiter was yes..refilling drinks.  The food was decent, no real complaints there...but nothing stellar.  

Meanwhile the toddler floorshow had ramped up to include our ballerina now brandishing one of the large knives from the table as she roamed the aisle waving it around and when finally capturing the glance of  one of her adult tablemates....she thrust it at them when told to behave with the raising of ones fist in the air.  Between wait staff having to dodge the waving knife and the loud singing of our ballerina, it made for a truly surreal rest of our lunch.

After finishing our meal - and being more than ready to make our escape, our waiter brought our bill.  Usually S and I split our meals down the middle when we go out and after glancing at our bill I handed it to S and asked if there was something out of the ordinary about it....S indeed also noticed that the first item on our bill was listed as an \"Employee Red Bull - $2.99\"

After bringing it to his attention, and him bringing a new version of the bill, we asked to split is and gave him two credit cards.  His face fell, and he stood for a long time at the credit card machine before enlisting the help of another server.  After a brief lesson he forged ahead and then after another failure...wandered off to the back of the restaurant for another few minutes before finally emerging with our bill and credit card slips.  By then more than ready to leave, we grabbed our cards and slips to find that he had not included a pen.

It's funny..sometimes a restaurant can get away with an off meal or two...but one always tends to remember when the service was just plain bad.  S felt bad about leaving only a 10% tip...but I had no problem.  The lunch had become a nuisance due to bad service, and it will certainly keep me from rushing back to Rock Bottom at Desert Ridge anytime soon."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in to Rock Bottom Brewery before a movie on a cold Thursday.  It was a short hike from the theater, but I am not cold tolerant, and was glad of the warm, comfortable restaurant interior.  It was pretty empty (my favorite), and we were ushered to a booth, which was roomy and comfortable.  

Our server was friendly, attentive, and made great recommendations.  The beers were very tasty!  Even though we were starving, our server recommended getting 1/2 order of nachos if we planned to get dinner.  GOOD TIP!!!  The half order of nachos is piled on to a traditional dinner plate, and it was plenty of appetizer for 2 people.  My friend got the country fried chicken with mashed potatoes and slaw.  She seemed to enjoy it.  I got the veggie pizza with feta, which was good, but I think I would have been happier with something else.  There was no fatal flaw in the pizza, I think I was stuck eating bread with grilled veggies and feta while my friend ate fried chicken- and that was entirely my fault. 

Overall, this was a positive experience.  It has a \"chain\" feel (because it is a chain), but I would go back and recommend it to others.  It is for foodies? Nope.  It is amazingly original?  Nope.  But it is good food, good beer, good service, and a fair price.  Definitely."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time in Jan. Had great service, great dinner of Mac n cheese, and cold beer. Signed up for their club dining card. Came again in February. Turns out we were told the wrong info about how the card works the first time. Had the hot cheese dip and it was so salty we could barely eat it and left it. Ordered a burger medium well and when it came,  I cut it in half so it would be easier to pick up. Then I looked at the side of the cut burger. The cow was still alive and mooed at me! Got the waiter and sent it back. 
My beer came and was lukewarm. I asked the waiter if this was the normal temp of their beer. I was told that is the way it comes out of the tap. Don't they keep the beer in a cold enough room? What will it be like in the hundred degree summer? Got another beer in a frosted mug and it was better. You must get a frosted mug in order to have a cool beer I guess.

Ok the first visit, not ok the second. Might or might not return."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time and ordered their steak street tacos, (how bad can anyone mess up tacos), and their serving size was terrible! I seriously thought what they gave me was a joke! I was so bummed because I really wanted tacos but they disappointed me so I had them take it back. I was really annoyed at the whole thing I didn't even want to eat there but I settled for a burger."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely terrible. Steak sent to table well done when told medium rare.....this caused our guest to eat alone for everyone else had finished while waiting for re-do. Waitress would ask if we wanted another drink, we said yes and told her what we wanted. 10 minutes later she came back and said do we want drinks!!! We politely said you took our order 10 minutes ago. This happened twice by same server!!! Salad dressing was so thick that it was extremely difficult to add to salad......the server said it was mayonnaise based balsamic vinegarette. It should not be pudding consistency Rock Bottom :( Just noticed this place has drastically gone down hill over the past few years. I never write a review but this evening was so bad for our out of town guests......."}
{"text":"It's good.  A better option than the nearby Chili's for sure.  3 and a half stars:)

I enjoy their happy hour.  $3 pints is a smashing deal and their beer is always great.  4 stars for their Roadrunner Brown and 5 stars for their Dream Catcher Light.

Don't try their Rocktinis - I'm pretty sure I had 3 ounces of watered down blue punch!

They also have a pretty solid happy hour food menu.  Love the ball park pretzel, love the boneless wings, love the chicken sliders.I haven't eaten in the actual restaurant in years so I can't comment on it.  

Happy Hour Mon-Friday til 7pm.  I think they have a reverse happy hour as well.  

It's a good comparison to BJs Brewery - but I like the beer at Rock Bottom Better.  I wish they would open one in LA, but I think the market is pretty saturated out there with this type of establishment.

Parking is ample - never had a wait.  Yay for XMAS fun with the family back in good ol' Scottsdale, AZ"}
{"text":"A friend and I had lunch yesterday and we both ordered the fried fish.  It was awful.  Tasted like frozen fish sticks they threw into a fryer and placed on a bed of fries.  I think you should get better fish for $14.00   On the positive side, the slaw was very good."}
{"text":"I've visited Rock bottom many times, but recently went after the remodel. The restaurant looks much better. I ordered the southwest turkey burger (awesome) and my husband ordered the chicken tacos (awesome)! The service was superb! I think the remodel improved the dining experience."}
{"text":"Last night, 1/17/09, my husband and I attended a birthday party for one of our friends at the Phoenix Rock Bottom location. While there, our service was terrible. We had to wait 45 minutes for our food to be ordered and we had to ask 3 times for a glass of water. The waitress took almost a half hour to bring our check to us after we asked for it. 

By the next morning, I looked at my bank account to find that they had charged us for our meal twice and the second charge was for 4 times the cost of the actual meal. After calling to speak to the manager today, I was told that the money was not taken out of our account yet. He acted as if this there was really no reason to be concerned. He then told me that he would call me back later. After 4 hours, I had not heard from him, so I called again to be told that he would call me when he was not busy.

I understand that mistakes happen, but I expect that they be remedied immediately and with a gracious attitude. At this point, my husband and I will not be returning to your company and we will be sure to let our friends know about this if the mistake is not at least reimbursed to us within 24 hours."}
{"text":"Decent food with a laid-back atmosphere. The burgers are very good, and the Brewer's Club is excellent (if you like focaccia). Stay away from the non-standard stuff like their Mexican or novelty sandwiches. I've been disappointed every time I tried to venture into that territory. The main dishes are generally pretty good, with my personal favorites being the Hazelnut Crusted Chicken and the Meatloaf. 

It's a great place to have lunch uptown. When the weather is nice you can sit on the patio and people watch. It's a safe place to bring non-adventurous lunch guests, as the food and atmosphere will have them feeling right at home."}
{"text":"This place is great! I've been going to rock bottom for about 3 years now and it's still our favorite place to grab some drinks and great food. The atmosphere is never quiet but never too loud. The food is the best part, I'm just sad they got rid of some of their older burgers."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour...Great service by Mark..Not so great spinach dip...beer on tap so so..
Would I go back...most likely...only at Happy Hour."}
{"text":"I like Rock Bottom. Been to several different ones between CA, AZ, and MN. The beer is good. Food is good. Service at the bar here in AZ has always been top notch! Best micro brew I've found so far. Wish there were more places here like in ABQ. Turtle Mountain, Il Vicino, Chama River... Rock Bottom will do just fine tho. Like this place."}
{"text":"I've been to rock bottom many times and plan on going back because I always enjoy the good food and great beer that is made on site. But this last time I went I was really impressed by the professionalism of the management. I just read the review by Erick V and I was there when the party from the ACN convention was at rock bottom, and they were out of control and ruining my dining experience. I was sitting next to the bar and twice I saw people from the ACN party steal my drink from the bar well. Andrea was quick to come over and very calmly take care of the problem, despite the fact she had to handle 100+ party out of control at the same time. And I was happy to see that she called the police because the party was literally stealing my drinks. And after reading the review from the ACN party I have to say when you go out to eat you shouldn't need a host or manager to tell you to pay your tab, you pay it on your own like a normal adult, and don't steal people's drinks."}
{"text":"Went here after work for happy hour with a group of coworkers. I had never been, and now I know why I will never go again. This is your typical strip mall restaurant and brewery where they all claim to have great food and great drinks. 

Well first off my drink was offensive, I ordered a your classic simple margarita. (not a hard drink to mess up right? well somehow they did, mine tasted more like watered down margarita mix without any tequila). Since it was a bar type restaurant, as far as bar food goes its blah! I ordered the Brew Burger with was suppose to have some kind of 
caramelized Ale onions. It was very dry and undercooked, I would of been better off walking across the parking lot and getting a burger at in and out. 

As far as service goes, the waitress was friendly and outgoing, but the drinks and food made the experience here one that that I do not wish to repeat."}
{"text":"Awesome food awesome atmosphere our service was amazing only 1 bad thing the green chili mash potatoes not as awesome as they sound"}
{"text":"This rock bottom doesn't disappoint. They really need to consider a nicer hostess but the service is usually great from the different servers I've had over the years.

I love the chicken mac n cheese and beer choice with it. I even tried replicating it at home. Good place for food uptown."}
{"text":"BALL PARK PRETZEL-Would eat again. 

I came to rock bottom, looking for a great beer. Full of hops, that brings a refreshing sensation and satisfaction. I then opened the menu, scanned looking for those select bar items to pair with my great beer. I saw an extensive list of items, from chicken fingers to salads. I noticed a Ball Park Pretzel, with a jalapeño cheese dip. I was blown away, the fact that I got 2 pretzels amazed me. I ordered within 25 minutes of seating. My pretzels hit the table within minutes. The smell of the warm salt and hot cheese opened my senses. But I knew we could step this shit up, I asked for mustard. And what do you know. Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard is in front of my eyes. I combined that shit and life evolved. I went to heaven, it took me 35 minutes to write this review because I took a solid bite with Grey Poupon after each sentence. Good look Rock Bottom, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"We walked downtown and got dinner here. I ordered enchiladas and while they tasted good, I was disappointed by the size. My girlfriend got some time of Cajun pasta that tasted good and was much more appropriately sized."}
{"text":"I always feel like I am constantly bashing breweries for their food, but in my opinion, I feel the bar is raised for places like this. It seems there are so many breweries out there that offer great beer, and slack off on the food. Unfortunately Rock Bottom is one that falls into that category. Let's be honest, when you go to a brewery, you want the full experience. If it was only about the beer, I'd go buy a growler and take it home. 

So, about the beer....EXCELLENT!!!!! The Jagoff IPA is with out a doubt one of the best IPAs I have ever had! They only I can think of that I think is better is Dogfish Head, but that's a matter of opinion. The beer selection is constantly changing, and they always have some excellent seasonal beers. You can't go wrong, there's bound to be a beer everyone will like. 

As for the food.......it's pretty much a crap shoot. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's terrible. My biggest problem is there is absolutely no consistency when it comes to the food. One time it's perfect, then maybe it's cold, or it's burned, or it tastes completely different from the last time you had it. Unfortunately, it seems there is zero attention to food quality. 

That's pretty much it. This place fixes it's food consistency, and it's a five star place. Till then, it's hit or miss!"}
{"text":"Food and beer were great.  Service was horrible.  It took 10 minutes to get a waiter to come to the table and then another 10 to get our drinks.  People s round us hsd s as me issue.  We then ordered 2 more beers. My beer came out in 10 minutes my wife's in 15. We then came to bill pay and we had a gift card.  Waiter did not take off gift card amount but rather took sll off on my credit card.  When I showed him the gift card he said oh sorry  thought was a Vic card.  Then had to back out charges from my credit card and add vorrect charges.

I go here a lot and food is always good but service has dropped off a lot."}
{"text":"I have been to Rock Bottom at Desert Ridge countless times...before a movie, after a movie and now for happy hour/dinner with friends.  It's a cozy place considering its size and Scottsdale-ish location.  The happy hour menu was actually really impressive.
Typically this kind of place is to polished and \"Scottsdale\" to even be worth a review, but the menu and beer make it a bit different...
Food:  Happy hour for $3!  Come on!   I got a 10 inch pizza for $3 and fries  for $0.99....And they weren't bad at all, I'd actually get it again...My wife got a salad with chicken that was fairly decent...
Beer:  For a \"micro brew\" ( I use the word lightly as a chain can't really be micro...That's like me saying that I'm punk, but selling 5 million records nationally... ) it's not bad...El Hefe is quite good and the Pale Ale is good, but not bitter enough...
This place gets 4 stars and not 3 for the price and decent selection alone."}
{"text":"Nicest patio downtown. There are much better wait staff downtown. Get the beer or wine. Stay away from cocktails. Food = pedestrian."}
{"text":"Planned a surprise birthday party here for my wife and they did an amazing job helping to pull it off! Service was extremely helpful, professional, and on point all night. Lauren (one of the managers) was reliable and pleasant throughout the entire planning process. If anyone is looking to plan an event I would highly recommend Rock Bottom. Couldn't be happier!"}
{"text":"Anything with \"Brewery\" in the name always attracts my attention, so I had to visit.  Especially when it is convenient to where I live.  So I have stopped there on several occasions, and tried a number of different things from their menu.

Did I mention it was convenient?  That seems to be the operative word, because I am not particularly enthralled with their food. I have tried appetizers, sandwiches, and entrees, and although it is good food, it is not memorable.  

Their beer is great,  though.  I have tried all of their dark beer -  Raptor Red, Roadrunner Brown, and Saguaro Stout.  Love them all. 

So this has become the kind of place that I go when I have friends in town that do not like to experiment - that are happy with any kind of food - and just want something edible and filling."}
{"text":"We have eaten there and get take out numerous times.
Their pizzas are awesome. Growlers to go etc.
But today I had my first 2am burger which finally prompted me to write a review.
Wow! This is truly an awesome burger. I'm still in awe.
Their beer is great too."}
{"text":"There are few local restaurants as popular as this place, the food is consistently good and the service always great. I meet people regularly at the bar, we usually have dinner but lately that's not always the case. The biggest complaint is that it seems the chef is intent on putting black pepper or some type of hot spice in all menu items."}
{"text":"I decided to bring my girlfriend in because she was craving crab dip.  Our server started off great she was friendly and seemed to have a general idea of everything.  After our two appetizers we waited about an hour for our food which never came.  We were told our food would be paid. A half our later our server comes back and regrets to inform us we will still have to pay for our food which we now in to-go boxes and delivered an hour and a half after our second appetizer. Our server apologized and offered to pay for our drinks out of her pocket. We were told our entree would not be taken off our check because the manager denied it took an hour and a half for the food to be delivered to our table. In all we paid for everything that we didn't get to eat hot but after the concert that we almost missed due to not being able to get a check from the server.  All said and done, the server was in great spirits and nice.  But was overall the worst experience I've had in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Just saw this on Yelp. Not known to pass up a brewery we stopped in for lunch.  Absolute KILLER Jalapeño pretzel sticks. Served with a jalapeño spinach cheese dipping sauce.  Very very good pizza also. Crust was done just right with just enough sauce. The on house IPA was equally as good.  Definitely will be back to try more of the menu but will have the pretzel sticks no matter what we order."}
{"text":"Great lunch!  Sat at the bar - busy spot - they have lots of take out orders.
Bartender do an ok job keeping up.
Salad was delish!  A little too much arugula , so I removed some and it was better.
Will look forward to coming back next visit to Charlotte"}
{"text":"Not edible. Came in for a quick bite to eat on a Sunday for lunch. Server was not knowledgeable about the beer menu and was hard to flag down for anything. The chicken was flavorless and tough. The fries were cold and mushy. Will not come back here."}
{"text":"Sat outside near the bar. The service was very slow and obviously not very interested in being there. After waiting for 15 minutes we decided to ask the hostess for service and menus.

The food was also disappointing. Ordered the avacado chicken sandwich and though I prefer smaller portions, this was a bit ridiculous. The chicken breast was so small. Worse was that there was no flavor. It was just all around bland. 

On the brighter side,  the bbq wings were good, so maybe I just ordered the wrong item. Would recommend not sitting outside or at the bar if you want food."}
{"text":"A disappointing experience! I have been to Rock Bottom several times before this trip. The pizza always seemed decent and the microbrews were okay too. Nothing special, but the location and atmosphere has always been nice.

The insert menu excited me when I got here...Oktoberfest...was here. I love German food and I love Oktoberfest beers. I mean...love...really love Oktoberfest beers. 

The German Burger: half a pound of meat with some cabbage, mushrooms, Swiss, and ketchup....on a fresh pretzel bun. Sounds great, right? Wrong! It tasted like a big meat patty...no flavor...nothing! Just plain boring.

The Oktoberfest Sampler Platter: Some type of \"Knackwurst\" corndog...which tasted pretty much like Pronto Pups at any northern state fair...not bad...but not warm in the middle. The fried corned beef and cabbage things were nice...but seemed pretty Irish to me. This also came with a fresh Bavarian pretzel with a variety of mustards...nice.

Now here we go! Rock Bottom describes their Oktoberfest beer as Full-bodied with a classic sweet flavor, Rocktoberfest is an award-winning Oktoberfest-style beer that is rich with a toasted malt character and finishes with a subtle crisp hop.

Now...if I was allowed to swear here...I would. In what world this beer is toasty, malty, finishing a tad hoppy...or award winning is beyond me. This beer is Budweiser with some caramel food coloring. This beer had no personality whatsoever! I can say that it finished nicely...by having no taste at all. Great job! I'm glad a terribly sub-par meal only set me back sixty bucks...I'd probably need a second job if I decided to eat somewhere with good food."}
{"text":"Great food excellent service.  I love the decor just a really nice place...moderately priced"}
{"text":"Completely disrespected during my visit there, by the general manager. My family and i would have been happier at McDonald's. This place is terrible. And the management staff is a joke"}
{"text":"On a glorious day in the month of May , my love and I stumbled hungrily into rock bottom.  Ha. Just kidding I realized Darren W. Hadn't reviewed here so I had to start it cheesy.  

The rock bottom line: Monday for lunch we had awesome service by Ashley.  We weren't rushed and it was quite.  The burgers were great and half off . The beer was very good.  We will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"Had the wings and Italian sausage pizza. They were exceptional. Very very good. Being a brew house we tried the honey ale and the white ale. I liked the white ale, honey ale had a bad after taste. Overall it was great."}
{"text":"While this is certainly not my first meal at Rock Bottom, this is my first meal in a year or two . The wait was minuscule, and the greeter was pleasant. As always it is a haircut weekend so the twin carnivores, the mother in law and I decided to tie the feed bag on at RB. Our server Matt was easy to work with and informative. 

I started off with the tortilla soup. Spicy and thick it went down easy enough. However let me say that the price at $3.50 was rather steep for the serving size. Did somebody say OUCH!! Thing one and thing two each had the 'small fry steaks'  with fruit (cantaloupe, melons, and grapes) and steamed broccoli and at $6.75 each, I think I was 'buffaloed' IF  you get my drift. The steak consisted of three small thinly sliced pieces of .... Hmmm. 

They say that kids say the darnedest things well thing one noticed that his steak was very very gristly, and thing two noticed that his was rather dry. Not the best dinner they have eaten. They say you get what you pay for OR NOT!!  

My meal consisted of the Chicken Bacon Mac & Cheese  and at $14.75 I had no complaints. It was filing hot and load with chicken and bacon. How can anything be wrong with that much BACON!!! 

The final dinner consisted of chicken fried chicken and at $13.95 my mother in law was sated. Over all this meal was a wash. If anyone from Rock Bottom corporate reads this... You may seriously want to rethink you portion sizes. 

As you know I vote with my feet and dollars, and neither will be there again ANY time soon!!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible - it was slow even though the restaurant was empty, service was not friendly. Food tasted like reheated old food (Jambalaya). Food was majorly over salted (fried chicken and potato). Sanitation leaves a lot to be desired, drink menus were sticky."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. In 2016, the service is terrible.  Too many better places nearby. RB needs to clean house on their management.  The chain as a whole is good; just skip this particular one.

One of my worst experiences was going there after a discovery place IMAX film, where they served the food on paper plates w/ plastic forks and knives because they did not want to run the dishwasher.  This was fairly early 6 pm SUN."}
{"text":"Average food although dessert was awesome.  Would get the salted caramel toffee. Waiter was very nice, however clearly made an error on our bill.  When asked about it, he admitted it was wrong and attempted to fix it but essentially came back with a charge that was essentially the same as before but now with a non-itemized receipt so you couldn't see the error.  Could have asked him to address it again, but wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout and was served MOLDY chicken fingers. After several attempts to contact management, I still haven't heard anything back. Never again."}
{"text":"Stopped in to do some work and kill time until my flight since I was in the area. Bartender was awesome with the service and friendly. Local beers were good and the Southwest Eggrolls were amazing. Will definitely stop by next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this place. A lot of people standing around, table and menus sticky, the food was FUCKED!! Sent my pathetic Bruschetta chicken back because it was the size of a chicken nugget with one giant stem of broccoli.  Do not come here to eat. 
2 stars because the beer was good."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Rock Bottom last weekend. It was my first time there. I just wanted a burger and she wanted a reuben. Once we were seated, we sat there in our booth for 15 minutes without being waited on. No one came to talk to us about our drinks or what we wanted to order during that entire time. But we noticed another couple who sat down after us who had  been given their drinks and their order was taken by \"our waitress.\" We got up and started walking out. My wife said to two people, a waiter and one of the managers, that we were leaving because of the lack of service. 

The manager, Summer, offered us a free meal on her tab if we could stay and enjoy the place. We stayed because not only would we now get serviced, but wouldn't have to go anywhere else. Our waiter was great at this point. He was checking on us every 5-10 minutes and at the end of the night, Summer provided us a $25 gift card to come back. This experience was more than what we had in mind, but it was great Summer was reaching out to us to make sure we could have a good time, get good food, come back, and tell our friends about the service we FINALLY received.

The food itself was OK. I asked for a medium well burger, but it was well done and tasted like charcoal, but I didn't want to complain anymore. The bottom line was they made my wife and I happy with the overall experience and we immediately told our family and friends about it. Next time we go, I just won't order a burger ;)"}
{"text":"The mac n cheese crocks are awesome.  I suggest a beer flight to find your preference."}
{"text":"Went there on a date lunch for my late honeymoon with my hubby. We got seated right away as there wasn't a big crowd. We sat by the bar, had fish and chips which was very good but the side of coleslaw could have done without the apples. But the service from the bartender was awesome and recommended an excellent beer choice. We will definitely be going back for another date lunch or date night when we can. To the bartender who looks like a taller Chip Foose you are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Great all American restaurant! Cool spot! Choose this place over your other chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch a couple of weeks ago. My sister has a gluten allergy and was given a menu, however our server didn't bother to write our order down and I had a feeling it was going to be messed up somehow. And what do you know, our order was delivered to our table 20 minutes later and there was a bun on her chicken sandwich. I was angry at this point and we had it sent back to the kitchen to be remade. The manager returns 5 minutes later with a new sandwich and offers us $10 off our next meal. I was suspicious about the food being delivered so soon but my sister ate it anyway -- the next day she broke out in a rash and had stomach pains because her food was contaminated."}
{"text":"The crab dip appetizer was totally awesome. The cooks made very good burgers. Our drinks were totally amazing. The best part of our experience was our waitress Lexi. She was very nice and courteous."}
{"text":"Last week I tried Rock Bottom Brewery in Phoenix, AZ(Desert Ridge Mall location). It was very tasty! I ordered the guacamole burger with fries and a cold beer. The atmosphere of Rock Bottom was very classy/sporty with tv's in every corner of the restaurant. It was very spacious inside. This restaurant would be great for family's or couples looking to get away from it all for a night out. The overall menu was pretty affordable. The appetizers were also good. I ordered the chicken quesadilla. Let me know if your in the area and I'd be more than happy to meet you at this restaurant for some travel stories!"}
{"text":"service is very good, prices are ok, the spinach dip, steak, and mac and cheese are all delicious. not the best place in desert ridge but not the worst either!!"}
{"text":"Best brewery on the west side. Burgers and service are top notch. We love our waitress Shannon and the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"We went here for my friend Mike's birthday, and the casual atmosphere, variety of choices, and beers made it an ideal choice. The location in Cleveland ain't bad either - if you come during the summer, you could take a stroll outside on the docks of the Cuyahoga and perhaps see the famous S.S. Good Times III! 

As for the food, it wasn't particularly memorable, but I would give it another shot, seeing as I only ordered their average burger, thinking it would taste \"beer-ish\". After making Rachael Ray's Smoked Gouda Beer Burgers (don't hate!), I don't know if any other beer burger will ever compare! Although I'm not generally a fan of beer, I tasted my husband's and it was really quite good! 

Other than that, the service was great. When my friends go out for birthdays, it's generally a large and lengthy affair with anywhere from 10 to 15 people. Typically, the waiters are irritable and frustrated by the time we order our 15 waters with lemons. Our waiter at the Rock Bottom was nothing but accommodating and pleasant!

They just lose a star for average food."}
{"text":"Went here at 10:30 at night for a 20 person party with a reservation which was confirmed multiple times. When we got there, their kitchen was closed and we were told that they would not open it for us. They supposedly will make up for this but not hopeful"}
{"text":"Went there last night. Their food is glorious (my mouth is watering just thinking about it right now). Definitely going back again."}
{"text":"If you want rock bottom food, head to Rock Bottom. Slow service, horrible, horrible food.   Was served freezing cold enchiladas and pizza.   The enchiladas were supposed to be chicken and had two tiny strips of chicken and I'm talking minuscule.   Rice was still cold when it was served a second time a half hour later.   Manager apologized and waitress offered us something while we waited for our food for the second time.   I don't know whose fault it was, but there are clearly some problems in house.   I'll take the blame for ordering chicken enchiladas at a brewery but wow, they were so horrid!"}
{"text":"I like this place, good food, great beer and, awesome service!! they have happy hour and, reverse happy hour seven days a week!!"}
{"text":"Just meh.  730 on a Monday night.  Only a handful of tables. Our waitress, Amina, was super sweet, definitely the highlight of the visit and probably the reason I didn't actually complain.  Took 40+minutes for 2 cheeseburgers and a kids cheeseburger.  Yes, was cooked as asked, which is good.  Not a terrible burger. Green chile cheddar mashed potatoes were terrible goo, and I love green chiles. Fries were okay.   Overall, sad we didn't go to Freddy's next door.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"The food was good and the prices were really good for the area the restaurant is at; we went on Friday night and it was nice. The server was very nice and attentive but we waited an hour for our food, which made the experience not a very enjoyable one."}
{"text":"They did a good job accommodating a large group. Mac N Cheese with chicken and bacon was good. In house beers were moderate and selection was limited. Good service, franchise-ish ambiance, nothing extraordinary but easy enough."}
{"text":"So Disappointed!

We went for my birthday last night. They were 4 in our party. We arrived at 6:30pm we ordered a drink and a few items off the happy hour menu. The food off the happy hour menu was good.

THEN WE ORDERED OUR MEAL, IT WAS AWFUL. We ordered BOURBONZOLA which was dry and tasteless, TUSCAN CHICKEN PASTA we sent it back to the kitchen because it looked like it had been sitting around for days and CHICKEN AVOCADO SANDWICH which was okay.  We will not be going back any time soon. They need to get a manager in there and get the place back in tip top shape because when we ate their 6 months ago it was good.  

Just so you know our bill was over $160.00 and for that the food should have been outstanding."}
{"text":"We went today to celebrate my husband's birthday. We arrived at 12:30 pm. We were seated in the 3rd booth on the eastside of the restaurant. Our waitress was friendly. I ordered one of their hamburgers, and I said to her absolutely NO MAYO! She acknowledge it, repeated it back to me. Needless to say the hamburger came out with mayo on it and not just a little, a gob of it. I scraped off the mayo the best I could but the bun was soaked in it so I just eat the meat, lettuce, tomato and the portobello mushroom. Our waitress did come back and ask how everything was, I was so pissed I could not speak and that was my fault. But what I don't understand is she can see that I scraped the mayo off, I did not eat the bun and she did not even acknowledge it. We ordered 3 pieces of carrot cake to go. When she brought the cake to the table I handed her the plate that had the gob of mayo and the bun for her to take away and she still did not acknowledge that they had put mayo on my burger. Oh, and ice tea should come with ice, just saying. I shouldn't of had to ask for it ice."}
{"text":"We decided to stop here on our way back home from a weekend getaway after going to Lego Fest with the kids. Hostess told us to take a seat anywhere and she would bring the menus. We sat down five minutes go by, ten minutes go by... at this point we were just waiting to see if any of the FOUR wait staff that walked by us would notice. Mind you, the restaurant was not busy. Although, the 3 tables that came in after us had been seated and waited on. Finally I flagged down a waiter and asked to see the manager. As soon as he acknowledged me he checked his watch as if to see if he had time to get the manager before his shift ended. Another almost 5 minutes pass by and a waitress comes over and asked if we had been helped. Explained to her that we had been waiting at that point 20 minutes she apologized and gave some lame excuse that our area was not assigned to any specific wait staff but they rotated tables. However, there was someone else that sat two tables beside us that was waited on already. Anyway, this waitress said that we would have excellent service from there on out. As she was there the manager finally showed up and offered and appetizer and apologized which was fine but beside the point by that time. We got an appetizer and ordered our food. Well, the customer service didn't get much better. We had to ask for napkins, silverware and appetizer plates, my sweet tea by that point was empty and I had to ask for a refill (my glass being empty at a restaurant is a pet peeve).  All in all the food was good not great but the service sucked from the beginning and it never got better. We will never visit there again."}
{"text":"We had the following items and they were great!!!
Artichoke crab dip
Mac and chicken
Black bean quesadilla w/chicken
Chicken tenders
Kids \"build your own Sundae\" dessert"}
{"text":"Beer selection was good, but they were out of the ones we wanted. 4 of the 6 people in our group ordered steaks all of them were cooked to their satisfaction. The bourbanzola was a good addition. Defiantly a place I would go again. Joe, our server, was awesome and super friendly."}
{"text":"Spent the day watching football, drinking some beer and munching in some very good food. Our waitress was outstanding and the overall vibe was so much fun.  Will definitely be back for more football and just to have a nice meal. My only issue... The food takes an awful long time. It's not the waitress's fault, but the kitchen is very slow. They're lucky everything else is so good or it wouldn't be worth going back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here hoping for better-than-average bar food and a good home brew while in Charlotte, but it was just meh. We were told we would wait for 20 minutes which seemed ridiculous as there were open tables all over the restaurant and bar and finally got seated in one of these open tables after 40 minutes of waiting. The $10 calamari was a very small portion, the sauces were obviously not made in-house, and the pieces of calamari were TINY! We both ordered mediocre salads and didn't find their brews to be anything special. Would have rather spent $50 elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love that this Brewery actually brews their beer at EACH location, which is very uncommon for a chain brewery.  The beer here is pretty darn good, and their brewer has the awards to show for it.  This place is in the area, and I have been going there for quite sometime.  The menu has seen a couple of changes throughout the years, some menu items are hard to say goodbye to and some I am super excited to say hello to!  The Texas Fire Steak and the Ballpark Pretzels with Spicy Spinach Cheese Dip are tried and true standbys.  The Cod Fish & Chips and the Little Italy (with chicken) are pretty darn mouthwatering new additions.  And being a mexican food purist, I was pretty surprised to find their enchiladas uber tasty.

Their Happy Hour food menu has recently changed, and now for $5 you get FULL Sized appetizers (except the sampler platter) and the beer prices are ever awesome during happy hour. (both regular hh and latenight) Only in the bar and patio, but there is plenty of room to spread out as the patio has misters and is dog friendly and the bar has both tables and booths.  A handful of large flat screens and a couple old school tvs finish off the bar with a large picture window into the brewery (free entertainment if the brewer is brewing at the time, get to watch him at work!).  The dining room has an open kitchen on one side and a wall of windows on the other.  They even have a private banquet room as well, pondering having a function there myself.  My friend and I went to eat here one day with her kids, and kids were free on monday and tuesday, which was pretty cool.

This place has definitely seen some changes over the years, but they try hard and if all else fails grab another beer and some chocolate cheesecake and you can't go wrong!!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately tonight was the last night this location was open. The only two locations left in the Valley are Desert Ridge and Arrowhead.  Please support them."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this location has closed.  The next closest location is at Desert Ridge 21001 N. Tatum Blvd.  (Tatum just north of the 101)"}
{"text":"Love this place. You get to experience the city without spending a thousand dollars. Lol  it is very clean and great food. You can sit indoor or outdoor. They validate your parking so you don't have to pay."}
{"text":"Service sucked, fish was gritty, beer sucked. The red was too fizzy and bland. The porter had no character like a burnt chocolate bar mixed with Alka-seltzer"}
{"text":"Great service= 5 stars
Clean restaurant = 4 stars
Food= 5 stars

I noticed they had lobster dishes and so I had them make me something not on the menu.... Lobster Mac completely threw them off .. after they got permission it was made for me... so delish!! My mom got a burger which was amazing too!! Paired up w some great beer and lunch was perfect. The only negative was the hostess opened up the patio door and I swear 100 flies came in... that's the worst thing ever for me.. not his fault tho... the manager came to our table and hung out chatted w us checked on the food was a real nice guy... for chain restaurants this was great."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Food is OK, but way overpriced. Quantities are small....much smaller than the picture in the menu. The beer is average. Butbyes"}
{"text":"On short noticed I needed a place to throw a business happy hour.  They gave me the entire private back room with a separate entrance and exit and our own server.  No hassle, no extra charges, no fees. Love it!!  Service was awesome and the Food is always good.  We all had a great time and I am a big Fan."}
{"text":"I have been here on numerous occasions with a variety of people and the one thing I must say about this place is inconsistency.  You can go there one night and have great food and service, whereas you could go there on a totally different night and experience the complete opposite.  The same goes for the food.  Some dishes are awesome (shrimp and grits, stuffed chicken) while others I would definitely shy away from (pizza).  If you are a beer lover, they have some good brews which are actually crafted on site.  The beer can be better than the food more times than not and I would recommend people to go here for that more than the food.  The Southern Flyer is great for pale ale folks like myself.  If you give this place a shot, prepare to roll the dice because you don't know who you will get, or what the food will be like when it comes out.  The one thing you will be guaranteed to have if you are so inclined is a nice brew made on-site.  Can't beat that sometimes..."}
{"text":"Saturday night, Valentine's Weekend around 7 pm - Larger tables sat quicker from what I could tell when we were waiting. I was with one other person and we waited upwards of 50 minutes for a table. When we were finally sat it was by the door where it was really drafty. It was below freezing out, and we were both really cold. The food was great though when it came, and it somewhat warned us up. We ordered the tortilla soup, nachos, Diablo pizza, and 2 am burger. The soup was delicious. I'm itching to have another bowl already. I also tried their darkest beer that had hints of cacao and peanut butter. I'm not a beer fan, but I really liked it. Our waitress was extremely nice as well. We were comped 20 something dollars when we didn't even complain or say anything. It was a nice surprise when we got our bill. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've gotta say, the new menu has not been a pleasant change at the old RB.

From my previous review, you know I was a big fan.  Not much has changed, with the exception of a redux on the menu that leaves classics and favs of mine off the list.

Sure, things get more expensive... that I can cope with and understand -- but when costs rise and quality (and quantity) falls -- I raise an eyebrow.  

I'll update again when something changes."}
{"text":"I stop by on occasion. I love the beers and I love the food. It's a kid friendly place and I thoroughly enjoy the different types of food. Very diverse menu and well executed. Much better than all of the other options around here. Did I mention the beers is excellent?"}
{"text":"Pork mexican dish with rice and beans was very tasty!  Laredo burger was tasty, but under my expectations for a restaurants burger.  Pub coleslaw was different and tasty.  I enjoy Erik the Red beer.  OVerall, this place is pricy.  The beer is more pricy than any other place I went in Zona.  It's a good place to try, but I feel like I'm in a more expensive Chilis when I should be at a more exciting microbrewery."}
{"text":"Went here to eat last night. My friend loves this place for their beer and really enjoys rocking happy hour. I myself don't drink so I can't comment on the quality of their beer.  We came in after happy hour, so the restaurant was pretty quiet and empty.
Our server came up right away and greeted us, which was great. He took our drink orders and had them back quickly. We still needed time to select our meals, so he left us with our menus. That was a bit of a mistake, because he didn't come back until nearly 20 minutes later, and only after we waved him down. Like I said, the place wasn't busy AT ALL. 
I ordered the Off The Hook meal, which was baked salmon, roasted asparagus, and lemon rice. The rice was pretty darn salty and I couldn't finish it. The asparagus was super limp, which the manager herself acknowledged and replaced with steamed broccoli without me even asking. The salmon and tartar sauce both tasted good. 
Our server was more attentive after our initial disappointment, which was helpful.
Overall, not a bad experience, not a good one. Just so so!"}
{"text":"Bathrooms haven't been cleaned in a while. Beer on tap wasn't cold/fresh, probably dirty tap lines. Burgers grease filled up half the plate. Glasses felt dirty. Won't be coming back. Gordon Ramsey would probably shut it down."}
{"text":"It's pretty ballsy to think you can get away with only serving your own beer. ...especially considering they're not all that great."}
{"text":"Rock Bottom has been our go-to place for a long time.  Relaxed, cheerful atmosphere, the beers are consistently good and the food never disappoints.  I can even accept the recent price adjustments.  Good food is worth it.  But in recent months the service has gone seriously downhill.  It feels like too few people are trying to accomplish too much and nobody's having fun anymore.  What happened?"}
{"text":"The food was good, the beer was excellent!   I had the 2 A.M. burger, the burger itself was good but the hash browns on it were not. My wife had the bourbon burger she said it was good. My oldest daughter ordered the kids hamburger and was impressed that it was cooked to order not the hockey puck on bread that kids normal get. My younger daughter got the build your own pizza and she actually got to \"build\" it before they put it in the oven. The food was a little slow arriving and the service was fair, we got more attention from our server than our waiter.  I had the three of their handcrafted beers, the IPA, the Hop Goddess, and the White Ale, they were all excellent!"}
{"text":"The beer is fabulous if they actually have it on draft and don't run out. Didn't love the menu. Great service at the bar."}
{"text":"We ended up here by default. If you like big, loud, chain restaurants with a decent beer selection and entirely average food and service, this is your joint."}
{"text":"Guac desperately needed salt. Mac n cheese was fantastic. Large outdoor seating. Microbrewery with good beer!"}
{"text":"Good happy hour that gets major kudos for including the weekend.  Their beers are excellent.  Bartenders a bit cranky at times but the place is never empty.  Excellent TVs."}
{"text":"Brewery nachos were good. Teri's Cajun pasta was bland and my shrimp & lobster enchiladas were like cardboard!  Bad food. Not a fan!!"}
{"text":"I pass this place everyday on my way to work and I finally stopped in with some business partners.  Good environment, but the staff needs training. We experienced a huge disconnect with multiple servers, remarks made by a particular server should not have been said , the time it took to get our beers could've been better as well.  The food and beer were good, it just took a long time to get it and the staff needs improvement. We are discussing gratuity now. Mmmm."}
{"text":"The servers here are good, and the place is gigantic so it has the convenience factor in terms of getting a table.  The food is mediocre pub food, and the beer is just ok for a place that advertises as a brewery.  It's a chain restaurant, and their beer outperforms other chains, but is still a cut below the really excellent breweries you can find elsewhere in Charlotte."}
{"text":"OK i had to write a review because I was very disappointed!

I gave this place the benfit of the doubt only because i heard they had a great happy hour and it is a brewery! Plus they only had 3 stars when i looked over the yelp reviews, I wanted to help improve that......Big mistake .....I should've listened to my fellow yelpers. I decided to have my birthday dinner here on a friday, we decided we would meet early for happy hour then move to dining area for dinner. Well my small party of 4 got there around 6:15pm, we thought it was just in time to put in a quick order for cheap food and drinks, but it took forever to find an available server, one guy stopped by and said he'll be \"back in a sec\" but never did. So we decided to move to the patio where we thought it would be easier to put in our order, the lady taking orders was nice enough to put our order in 2 minutes before it ended. We were rushed and didnt even have the HR menus to look over because they guy never gave us them and there weren't any on the patio table. She was also pretty slow at getting them, i'm sure we would've had 4 minutes to order if she knew the urgency of HR ending at 6:30pm!!  Come on now.....There were alot of older people and it got pretty dead after HR ended..

After that we moved to the dining area where other members of our party met us. The menu looked good from the pictures and description they gave....but the beer selection was very limited. :( White ale, red ale, dark ale??? ok.. at least put some personality into naming them and make sure your server is educated on each beer.

Over all the food sucked and beer sucked. No taste in either one.. It was a sad birthday dinner, yes i ate all my food because i was starving! I didnt get sick so that's good.... We had one beer/drink each and regreted the beer choice after the first sip, we left right away to get a real drink. Oh I did have a choice of either a free cake or drink for my Bday, I chose the carrot cake.. it was good, not the best. She just sat it down on the table said happy birthday then walked off......uh thanks yay happy birthday to me... oh and she charged us for the cake.. but corrected it after we mentioned it.

 I know better now to stick with the good ol' Four Peaks Brewery for GREAT Food and Beer!  They have an extensive selection of beer to choose from, even if it isn't made in their brewery!

Servers/ hostess were nice, except for mr. invisable... 

Just dont go....maybe for HR but you wont taste much:(

*Excuse my spelling and sentences, just so much happened and I can't think right trying to get it all out!"}
{"text":"Went for a late night dinner. They catered to my  low sodium needs. My salad was amazing! My captions were all happy with their food!"}
{"text":"Good beer...good food, but hey, Rock Bottom...take a hint from your neighbors over at Red Robin and stop letting people bring their kids, little or otherwise, into your bar! All your Adult customers will really appreciate it!"}
{"text":"Rock middle more like.... We went here a few weeks ago... Food was overpriced and meh. The server was sooo schmooze-y that it was unbearable...nice enough I guess, but who you kidding kid? We know you hate this job. Anyone who doesn't hate serving is on something, but I digress. I went here a few years ago when I was just vacationing here and felt that it was just as than non-noteworthy then. I won't be going back now. Just too much money to spend on mediocre food."}
{"text":"This has been my #1 place to visit since I moved here almost 7 years ago.  They have great craft brews, awesome Happy Hour food and drink specials, and the food is definitely not your usual \"bar food\".  The steaks, burgers, pizzas, sandwiches, appetizers, and seasonal items are all great, but it's the last part that keeps me coming back.

I'm not much of a creature of habit, so much so that I almost always have to try something new.  Usually they have a new seasonal menu with about half a dozen new items on it every three months, so if I run out of new things to try there's always more coming soon.

Plus, I'm a big fan of the Brewer's Dinners.  They have a multi-course meal, each paired with a beer, every few months or so.  These have been some of the best dates ever!  They have an awesome rewards program - the Mug Club - though it was a lot cooler when they had stuff like shirts and hats as the rewards.  Still, after you spend a certain amount you get free appetizers, burgers, etc.

Service is usually really good too. For a while they had a couple of servers who were really nice though kind of slow, but lately everything has been top-notch."}
{"text":"I am not a regular guest here, this is maybe my second or 3rd visit, ever. I wanted to go to Texas Roadhouse because I just was craving a steak. My son was my date yesterday, and he didn't want TRH. So, we decided to do something different, and this got the approval because he has geocached nearby. (LOL) We came early, around 3pm. Seated immediately and the dining area wasn't busy. The bar area was because of the football games. 
I started with a strawberry margarita- it was ok. Nothing special. I ordered the Sirloin steak, cooked medium, with cilantro lime rice for 20 bucks. My kid got kids meal stuff. Hard to mess up. My steak came out and was not what I ordered. It was a thin skirt steak folded in half, cooked well done. I let the waiter know I would keep it since we were in a time crunch to see a movie, but that it was incorrect. He offered to replace it but it really was ok with me to keep it. Moments later a manager came over to check as well. He confirmed it was not even the right cut. I reassure them its fine because really, mistakes do happen. 
They comped the entrée, which was very nice and even offered a free dessert. We were full, so we declined the dessert, and I tipped my waiter the cost of the steak entrée. 

I probably wont return, not for any reason other than I'm not overwhelmed with excitement at the menu anyway, and I try to check out different spots. However, I think that despite an error, the staff and management were superb in the follow up and damage control. Even being incorrect, the food was good and the service was great!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been to this great place several times. Each visit has been pretty good. Their steaks, burgers, veggie burgers are very tasty.
Good place to lunch or dine in with family or friends.
Grant it it is not perfect, but...that is ok. They make it up with the great food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I had been to a Rock Bottom restaurant before (in Illinois), but this may have been my best experience at one yet.

I didn't think the restaurant interior looked as nice as the location I visited in Illinois, but for some reason I thought the food was a whole lot better. We couldn't believe how good everything we ordered was. We ordered some guacamole along with a brewery appetizer platter and we cleaned the plate. I also had the Tuscan Shrimp Pasta, which I thought was excellent. The service could have been a little better and the price is a little more expensive than what we expected, but I think we will be back for the food!"}
{"text":"Great place for after work happy hour. Want to say thanks to Maggie for always giving us great service every time we come out. Tryin to lobby to change the name of hop goddess to hop Maggie bc she's so cool.  Also want to thank Germaine for being such a great cook and all around cool guy"}
{"text":"Grade 90. Stood at hostess stand for 6 minutes until someone said I'll be right back. After 3 more min. I left."}
{"text":"This place is pretty much lackluster ...  To start it's absolutely filthy, hands prints are literally on everything. The bathroom was disgusting and looked like it never had been cleaned, I was scared to even use it.  The server was nice but couldn't even tell us what was in the sauce that came on a simple burger.( maybe she was new?) She was also really slow and it took an incredibly long time just to get a another water. Food wasn't terrible but some of our burgers were missing ingredients. The host did notice us looking around for our server and came over to help us, he actually did a better job taking care of us than our server... no offense to her because she was really sweet but was very uniformed and slow. Thanks, Matthew!! He's the only reason the review gets 2 stars."}
{"text":"Not as good as the Rock Bottom at Shea and the 101. 

We went here for a late lunch and quick drink. I was excited to get the nachos I loved so much that I have missed since the R B at Shea ant the 101 closed down but either I remember them incorrectly or this location does not pile it on the way the Scottsdale location did....then again maybe that is why they went out of business. 

With that being said we did annihilate that nacho platter. It was big enough for two. So it is a good place, nothing to rave about but it you are looking for a Cheers-like atmosphere and in the area I say it is worth it."}
{"text":"Rock Bottoms is a great place to drink, eat and enjoy friends.  The beer selections designed by brewer Meg are fabulous.  The pizza is really good.  Fish and chips was big enough to share.  Just started ordering the fried pickles-delicious.  Make sure you join the Rock Rewards and get prizes and email specials.  My favorite place"}
{"text":"I go here maybe once or twice a year since they have a BOGO coupon in the Citipass book but that's really the only thing enticing me to go. They have a nice patio area where you can sit back, relax, people watch and enjoy some humdrum food. Only complaint-random, crazy people screaming about Jesus and the noise from the Gold Rush and other CATS buses. Last time I went, our server was very sweet but it took almost 30 minutes for our lunch to make it out. I ordered a chicken sandwich and french fries-were they killing the chicken in the back?? I kept watching servers go by with other peoples food, practically salivating over the plates of french fries since I gave it up for Lent and just wanted one fry to make me happy. Thank God I didn't order their fish tacos (which I've heard are fantastic) because they probably would have had to go catch the fish to make it)

I heard they validate parking which is a pretty nice touch if you don't live or work in the Uptown area. You have to park in the parking deck either below or on the side of RB.

I like it for after work drinks as well but besides that, as Stephen K said, easy to enjoy and easy to forget."}
{"text":"My family decided to visit Rock Bottom Brewery while spending a day in Arrowhead. Originally we were very excited to eat at a restaurant whose other location was considered one of our favorites prior to closing their doors at Desert Ridge Marketplace. We entered the restaurant and were greeted by a hostess that was very kind and offered us a high top because no booths were available. We decided to sit in what we thought was the bar. As we sat in the bar, we noticed numerous booths that were sitting dirty and unavailable. We continued to sit without seeing as much as one waitress pass by and not acknowledge us at all. Finally after 10 minutes the hostess passed us, and made us aware we were not sitting in the bar, but the dining room and if we wanted service, we'd need to move to the bar if we desired to be seen by one of the few wait staff. 
After moving to a location in the bar, it took about five minutes to be acknowledged by a waiter who said he'd be back to take our drink order. I decided to order an Arnold Palmer (iced tea/lemonade), only to be made aware they were out of lemonade and made me a makeshift Arnold Palmer out of iced tea and sweet'n'sour mix from the bar. After placing our order with our waiter, we probably saw him only a handful of times from drink order to check paid. In all honesty, it seemed like they were dangerously understaffed and unprepared for any sort of lunch rush on a Sunday mid afternoon."}
{"text":"Ok so they say they close in 10 mins instead of just saying kitchen is closed, the cook makes my food really fast & instead of just not doing the steak the cook burns it & I pick it up 5 mins after ordering, food is burnt called talked to the manager which was a female at the time, she had no consideration she gave half the money to the girl that waited on me i don't care what time you close it's customer service it's the business so I'll never order & not only hat she only gave half back & didn't even come speak to mean work manager of the year goes to this women if your jobs to hard quit! Don't waste your time here not worth it worst customer service in 2018 food over cooked & rude manager it's 11:50 on Monday & my jambalaya was horrible but didn't feel like returning do to rude manager first & last time trying, will never recommend"}
{"text":"You definitely don't want for choices with the Rock Bottom menu.  They cover all sorts of ground in the American/Tex-Mex/Americanized Ethnic food types.  But of course, most places with big menus have lots of food that is between pretty good and pretty mediocre.  I had an okay bowl of chili, my guest had a chicken pot pie  that she did not care for.  Burgers and sandwiches are solid.  We all loved the excellent, addictive fries: they're the thin snacky types full of potatoey flavor.
Oh man and I tried the seasonal beer - a bock - which was a pretty good deal.  We figured that it was 25% more beer than the standard serving but at only 12.5% higher cost.  Anyway the brew was a knockout.  Don't drink it on an empty stomach, but do drink it."}
{"text":"A group of eight of us came here because Burgatory couldn't seat us (big surprise there) and none of us had been at this location before so we were willing to give it a shot.  They were able to seat us, not at the same table but at two adjacent tables.  We were flexible and more than happy to take that.

I had the Bourbonzola burger.  It wasn't the best burger I had ever had, but it certainly wasn't the worst.  It satisfied the craving I had and that was really all I expected.

The reason I'm giving this place a four star is the beer.  I had the High-Level IPA and it was fantastic.  Rock Bottom is know for its beer and they did not disappoint.  Everyone in our group that had beer was impressed.

Don't go to Rock Bottom necessarily expecting the best food you've ever had and you won't be disappointed with the experience.  What you can do though is go expecting some pretty damn good beer.  Do that and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Our Ice Hockey Team of 44 people were here on 2/14/15.  We called prior and they ensured us they could accommodate our party.  It took over 1 hour and 20 minutes to get our food.  No refills on drinks were offered and the wait staff did not even know who ordered what when the food came out.  The food sat on a tray while they ran back and forth to the kitchen to try to figure it out.  We asked for our bills at the time we ordered.  They did not bring them out until after we ate and that took quite a long time.  When we asked the Manager where our food was? he stated what do you expect you are a party of \"44\"?  He did not even turn on the TV for our boys until requested.  We ate and were in a rush to go to the Coyotes game as we were running behind by this time.  They did not even know how to handle our credit cards and even suggested we go ahead and pay for things we did not buy that were on our bills!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here more than once but the food has gone down hill since I last dined here. The beer is great with lots of different choices and menu gives good details about the flavors. I had a steak, which was cooked to order but I have had much better quality steaks at other restaurants for less. The broccoli was terrible. Service was okay, with friendly staff. I would much rather pay $60+ for at a much nicer restaurant. I don't really plan to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed my first visit here. I got the Turkey Meatloaf and it was really tasty. It's more sausage than turkey. The cheesy mashed potatoes were excellent. The star of the night was the appetizer, the artichoke and crab dip. It was awesome. My only complaint was I ordered a Red Ale and they were out. I had the Curmudgeon instead and it was very good, but still."}
{"text":"I ordered Rock Bottom from Grub hub and got it delivered to my home. I ordered Southwestern egg rolls, bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers, Chicken fried chicken and a Rock bottoms classic burger. The food was pretty good overall but the ranch dressing and egg rolls were very spicy I wish that they indicated that they would be on the menu."}
{"text":"Nothing stands out at this pub eatery. I went there for a chamber lunch twice and both times the meals was subpar and very small portions."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night! We were sat right away in a booth! Service was good. Our waitress offered me samples of the various beers to assure I liked it before ordering, which I appreciated. The food was very good, I would recommend the 2:00AM Burger! The bathrooms however were awful! The ladies restroom was very very dirty!

Overall the food was amazing, beer was great and service was wonderful but can't give a 5 with a bathroom like that!"}
{"text":"Today's visit: wine had a film on it, I had to ask for lemon with my water three times, the kids pizza is now some horrible wheat looking crust (supposedly some beer brew) and I had a bone in my first bite of burger. The manager came over to tell me the chefs cut it open and it wasn't a tooth (oh, goodie) and that it was an almond. You gotta be kidding me. Do I look that stupid? I told her I almost BROKE A TOOTH. That was NO almond. She was proud to tell me she took off my burger. Wow. That's so nice of you. I only had one bite, which I spit out, so that is the least you could do. She walked away. Obviously, she's right and I don't know what I'm talking about. Maybe I should've bitten down harder and actually broken my tooth so I could send them the dentist bill as proof. 

We WON'T be back. And it's sad, because we've been coming here for more than a dozen years..."}
{"text":"We came here 10 minutes before the kitchen closed and we were starving 11:50pm. The staff treated us like ROYALTY and we were served by 4 different staff with nothing but absolute politeness. And also, the beer and food was fantastic. Would come back 100%"}
{"text":"Very noisy on a Friday night, service was a bit slow, but thankfully we weren't in a hurry. Had the bacon wrapped stuffed jalapeños and they were really yummy! Had the Rib eye steak & it was very good, cooked the way I wanted it. Apple slaw was good also. Tried the raspberry chocolate mouse-took it home to enjoy & it was very chocolatey!"}
{"text":"The beer quality and food quality has improved since the last time I patronized this establishment about a year ago. We had started to become regulars - have food, drink beer and play English darts. Unfortunately, management has decided to remove the darts and the pool tables. Without the dartboards, I see no reason to go to Rock Bottom. The beers aren't great and the food is average for the price. They almost had me back..."}
{"text":"Very middle of the road. Average in every sense of the word. Not great, not terrible. I don't think I need to go on."}
{"text":"I am a fan. We've definitely gotten a few dishes we didn't care for (we being the man and I), but sometimes thats just how it goes. Overall, the good dishes have far outweighed the bad.

KILLER happy hour. They've changed it 3x in 2 years which can be a bit annoying, but every single thing we've ever ordered off the $3 happy hour menu has been thoroughly enjoyed. Tasty beers, the man loves their raptor red. 

Amazing veggie burgers, and I am not even a vegetarian! This is probably one of my favorite things on their menu. The only thing they don't do well is pizza..... but other than that I love this place, which is different for me as I am not a fan of chains generally."}
{"text":"They've remodeled the inside of the restaurant and it looks great! The beer is great and the service really good. The food is overpriced. It's good food, but not worth the $$. I'd prefer to grab a beer here and eat somewhere else uptown for the money."}
{"text":"Really had a wonderful time here outside even though the wind picked up The background music @ Desert Ridge was great.  We had beer & appetizers at HH.  All was good and I really liked their salsa.  I choose them specifically becoz they had free wi-fi and that was the best!  Thank you!!  I won't be going too many places at Desert Ridge that don't have it."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about Rock Bottom!! I absolutely love this place. The food is consistently good, but the staff is what really highlights this place. The bartenders are extremely friendly, especially if you tend to come around a lot. Uppity Jagoff is consistently a fantastic beer. There is a bar area on the left upon entry, with smaller tables and more of a 'sports bar' kind of vibe. And then on the right is more of a dining room feel, with booths and larger tables. Both are great depending on the kind of party that you are catering to. Also, try the chicken fried chicken if you can, it is the best!"}
{"text":"Good food, good beer, good ambiance.   Unfortunately they won't be around much longer, so get there before Feb. 1.  Looks like the Glendale location will be the sole survivor..."}
{"text":"Visited long lost family in Charlotte, and at the last minute they decided that we should go to Rock Bottom instead of another restaurant we had reservations for. I didn't argue because I wasn't the one driving and I didn't really know better. Now I wonder what the other restaurant would've been like.

I was sold on Rock Bottom because my cousin said it has the best key lime cheesecake anywhere. I ordered some weird steak and shrimp combo and it was overcooked and forgettable. The martinis were decent tasting but not strong at all, and the service was dismal. 

The cheesecake slice was giant and I required a take-out box for it, and the next morning it was pretty tasty. So... go there for a few martinis when they're on special and get some cheesecake if that's your thing, but don't expect to get in and out of there in under two hours."}
{"text":"Good: 
Beer and cocktails are good and reasonably priced. - apparently brewed in house right behind the bar? A unique selection - the beer version of my favorite coffeeshops, hah.
Vibe is super chill - great place to relax, watch the game, and grab some drinks.
Service is attentive and friendly.

Meh:
Food is quite expensive for the quality and portion. The menu is uninventive and leans completely toward heavy... or a salad. Clog artery or eat like rabbits :( Their salads probably aren't super healthy either. Not a place I'd go just to eat their food, and they probably know this. You go to grab a drink, you get hungry, eat food out of convenience.

I guess not a place I'd go out of my way to visit for a drink, either. but for being in the waterfront - if i'm in the area, it's an option."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Nothing special, but everything was fairly well done.  Went for a lunch meeting and had the southwest salad.  The jalapeno ranch was made in house and was great.  The baguette on the side was a nice touch.  Service was perfect: attentive but not hovering.  We were able to get in and out quickly.  Other diner thought the ahi tuna salad was good as well.  Tuna was perfectly done and contained a good sized lunch portion.  Other meals (chicken avocado sandwich and bacon cheeseburger) looked uninteresting."}
{"text":"Awful. The whole experience was dreadful. The server is taking my check now. Appetizer plates are still on the table as well as the menus. We had to ask for refills each time. The server was nice but not very good. We had the pleasure of hearing a hostess yell \"i shouldnt be doing this s!!! I'm a hostess\". And finally, the food. A more expensive Applebees comes to mind. Chicken was chewy and had a nasty texture and we all had chicken. The bacon, chicken, and mac n cheese was highly recommended by the server. I thought it was ok at best. Wont be back."}
{"text":"Easy to enjoy and easy to forget.

Rock Bottom is fine but not exceptional; the nachos are tasty, but isn't that true everywhere? I seem to remember a nice fish taco, but it might have been a black bean burrito. That's the sort of food you'll get. Enjoyable, but forgettable. This place's real appeal is a social one. Its outdoor seating is some of the best in Charlotte: in front you're on a busy street corner, perfect for people watching, and in back is a quieter courtyard. The interior is big and comfortable, so you'll want to linger and you'll never feel rushed. Bring good friends, and enjoy the beer.

Which brings us to their status as a brewery. Supposedly they brew a host of award winning beers on the premises, but nothing I have tasted has been exceptional. I suspect that in this regard, breweries are like car companies - there are more than enough awards to go around and even the most mediocre beers will win something. Or maybe I just don't appreciate good beer."}
{"text":"I read ALLL the reviews for Rock Bottom.  I was 100% certain the food would suck.  I was totally wrong.  With a group of 15 girls..they server was more than able to keep up, and the food was everything we had hoped.  We all got Appatizers, so I cant review the meals.  But here is what I can:

Ballpark Soft Pretzels with dip= AMAZING! *Hit the spot..perfect with beer!

Nachos= HUGE PORTION + GOOD (it covered half of our table)

Crab Dip= A+

Strawberry Beer= Hit of the Night.  YOU EVEN GET FREE SAMPLES TO TRY WHICHEVER KIND YOU WANT.

I WAS PROVEN WRONG.  I WILL GO BACK TO ROCK BOTTOM BEFORE GOING TO SING SING OR JUST FOR A BEER SAMPLING NIGHT OUT WHENEVER I HEAD BACK TO PITTSBURGH AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Meh.  That sums it up for all my experiences here.  I always go in with high hopes, and come out having had a so-so experience.  The beer doesn't really float my boat.  Although, they did have a pretty decent sour when I was there a couple of weeks ago.  The first time out of my 5-6 visits I found something I liked.  The food is okay.  Like most restaurants, they don't have a TON of vegetarian selections, but definitely enough that I felt like I had options.  My partner and I had veggie burgers during our last visit there.  Nothing special.  The fries were pretty good.  Liked how they were seasoned.  One thing that really stunk about our last trip was the amount of time it took to get our food.  It wasn't our server's fault, and she did check on us once to say sorry for the delay.  We were also dining with friends who'd had such a horrible experience the last time they came that management gave them $70 worth in gift cards for the restaurant and offered to comp their last meal.  Geeze!  Kind of stinks that when you give the place another try with the gift cards, things are still lacking.  We'll probably visit again, but this isn't my first choice for dinner when going to the Waterfront.  One thing I will say is it has adequate seating for large groups, and loud children would probably make out okay here as it gets pretty packed on the weekends.  A good place to take family from out of town."}
{"text":"I like Rock Bottom.  It's in a great location Uptown and offers a good American menu in a nice, casual setting.  I can always count on great food and great service.   If you want a \"light\" meal, they have an abundance of salads to choose from.  I'm working my way through each of them, but I haven't had a disappointing one yet and they're each very filling.  If I'm a little hungrier or craving a hot meal, I tend to go with the Blue Crab Stuffed Chicken or the Hazelnut Crusted Chicken.  Mmm... they're both melt-in-your-mouth good.  Then I usually wash them down with whatever brewed-on-the-spot beer they have on special, preferably something light.  

Rock Bottom is a good place to take eaters that don't like to experiment with gourmet food (but you can still find something gourmetish yourself!), out-of-town guests, or even a date for a nice, casual get-to-know-you meal in nice surroundings without any pretension.  It can even serve as a great standby if everything else Uptown is too crowded or you can't decide where to eat.  You'll never be disappointed."}
{"text":"Standard issue Rock Bottom.  We ordered the nachos....they could have easily served 6 people.  I have never seen a more massive platter of food.  Bar service was okay...guy working there was nice to talk to about sports."}
{"text":"Restaurants and bars in the Flats seem to have trouble delivering good service.  We sat at the bar and ordered 2 beers.  The bartender asked if he wanted to open a tab.  Well, we sat there with empty glasses and she never asked us if we wanted to order more beer.  If I was the owner I'd kick her ass for not generating more revenue.  This is the second time I've had this happen to me at this place.  It was crowded on a Wednesday night but the buck stopped there..."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Rock Bottom Brewery several times with friends and family and never once had a bad experience.  Good beer, sandwiches and burgers.  The bar area gets a little crowded on weekends."}
{"text":"Came with my BF we started with the crab artichoke dip. It was very greasy and had virtually no crab. The wedge salad was good and crisp. I had the hazelnut crusted chicken. This has to be one of the worst dishes I've ever had it was like pancake syrup over breaded chicken. To finish the meal we had the homemade chocolate chip cookies served with hot fudge. Well there was no hot fudge it was chocolate syrup the ice cream was so crystallized from melting and re-freezing all around disappointing."}
{"text":"My visits here are generally pretty consistent.  I love getting the beer sampler even though I've drank all the beers twice over.  I wouldn't say I have a favorite dish here yet but the food was always generally good.  I guess one thing that sticks out is the chicken mac and cheese and the Reuben.  

When I go here though, I'm going for the beer more than the food.  Definitely worth a trip for dinner."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed to the recent changes made at Rock Bottom! As a Weight Watchers member, having healthoer options when out to eat is vital. I used to love coming to RB for the turkey burgers.

Now the turkey burrs are gone to make way to push for the veggie burgers - not as good. I asked for a different bread option for their Turkey Reuben but none was available. I asked for a salad with low fat dressing, but again, none was available.

I almoat walked out because I couldn't find anything that I could ven make a special cooking reqieat on.

I won't be back."}
{"text":"The service was slow. And by slow I mean nearly absent. Our original server took our drinks order and then didn't come back for about 15 minutes. We ordered our apps and the our entrees at the same time. The restaurant was not very crowded as we were there at 3 in the afternoon. I ordered a second beer and it never came. I got my food which had the hottest jalapeños on it and burned my mouth. I wish that beer was there. I had to drink some of my son's drink to avoid spontaneous combustion. Several minutes later a different waitress came over and asked us if our original server had told us he was transitioning to hostess. We told
Her no but I did ask her if my beer I had ordered 20 minutes prior might come now. She did return with it and told me it was on the house so that was better. 
The food was good enough for bar food. The service might be the only reason we don't return. 
The bar was missing several  of their brews as they had \"run out\". One of the reasons we went was for the large beer selection and was disappointed. 
Wasn't the worst dining experience we've had but the service was poor."}
{"text":"everytime i come here i stick with the nachos add chicken add side of guac and i've never been dissappointed.  i sit in the bar, grab a drink or 2 and eat those nachos.  the bar has a pool table and plenty of flatscreens.  rock bottom is a chain but it's one of the better chains in the area.  i'll pass on chili's or friday's and come to rock bottom instead.  oh and typically i walk over to target - work off some of those nachos."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with this place. The menu sounds really great& the waitress suggested I get the chicken bacon Mac & cheese, but it was disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"A bunch of friends from out of town show up the other day. They like craft beers so we decided to try out this place. So we went there and tip a few in the bar area and watch the World Series. The beer and food were good and my visiting friends like what they tasted. So did I. The service was good and I am sure I show up again."}
{"text":"Went here for a bachelorette party of 12 girls, we had a reservation, waited 10 minutes to be seated, was seated a four different tables that we had to asked be pushed together.  We then sat at least 15 minutes before we were greater and our drink order was taken, but the drinks took almost 25 minutes before arriving.  When our drinks did arrive, the server ran off before taking our dinner order, more time passes... we order and our food comes out pretty reasonably ~15-20 minutes.  When the food did come out three orders were missing completely, our server did not bring our food and was nowhere to be found, we sat waiting until finally she came by.  At this point we've been here well over an hour.  The manager comes by, gets the food out, says that there would be a free round of drinks for the whole table.  I didn't receive the drink promised by the manager and when I asked the server I got a look, this was the first and only time I asked her about anything!?  She brought the drink as I was returning from the restroom and said that an entire bottle of wine would be brought out due to the issues, we explained that we had other commitments that it wasn't necessary.  Then the manager threw in two bottles of champagne, at this point, I'm pretty sure he knew that nobody had a great experience and was trying to save face.  

In the end, the manager was great at covering up for the lack of service we received but with so many options in downtown Charlotte I would chose another place next time."}
{"text":"We had great service and delicious food on our recent visit to Peoria. Their beers are better than average and a nice menu variety. We had the gumbo and fried chicken both great! Plenty of tvs and plenty of seating. I will go back my next time to town."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were both craving a burger one Sunday afternoon and this is where we ended up! I had the Bacon Cheddar burger, which had this bbq/ranch sauce on it and it was sooo good. Mike got the 2 AM burger which was topped with an egg (this is Mike's favorite type of burger!). They both came with fries. I'm not sure what the seasoning is on the fries, but those were excellent! I've had other things off their menu but I definitely recommend a burger!"}
{"text":"I met a couple of girlfriends here for dinner and drinks on Friday evening. Parking was easy because the restaurant is attracted to a parking garage and...yes! They do validate parking. 

We started in the bar area, which was pretty crowded. We were hoping to grab a table but quickly found out they take reservations at those tables so we were moved to the main dining area once everyone arrived. 

The bartenders were awesome! With so many beers on tap, I had no clue which to try first! So she let me sample some of her favorites and I found that the Kolsch was a winner!! It was light and refreshing and a perfect compliment to our appetizers. 

We ordered the Brewery chicken nachos and Southwest egg rolls, both were delicious! The nachos come with an entire dish of freshly made salsa and the they load you up on the toppings: cheese, sour cream,black beans, chicken, onions, jalapeños and guacamole. The egg rolls are deep fried and stuffed with chicken, beans, red peppers, zucchini, tomatoes, corn and pepper jack cheese! Yum. 

For dinner I went with the Southwest Turkey burger. The turkey burger is mixed with peppers and onions which adds a really nice flavor to the meat! They then top it with lettuce tomato, avocado mayo, fried peppers, sliced avocado and pepper jack cheese. I really enjoyed it! The fries weren't my favorite...they were shoe string cut and a bit too crunchy but at least they came out hot! 

All in all, I'd definitely return and recommend a visit to anyone!"}
{"text":"Pros: I went here yesterday and had a great time.  They have a fun and friendly atmosphere with attentive staff. The place was busy but they were still able to accommodate everybody within a reasonable amount of time. The food was excellent and decently priced. This place would also serve well as an \"after hours\" location to grab a drink after work or to meet up with friends. 

Cons: Located in a not-so-nice area. Definitely an \"All American\" style restaurant so there were not many healthy choices."}
{"text":"Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. 
Not one to complain and understand the frustration of waiting tables but this was beyond ridiculous

9:30 pm on a Thursday night. A handful of patrons throughout, at best
Several employees everywhere (not busy)
Wait approx 7-10 mins ... No wait staff

Ass the 'bus boy' if anything be is working out area who states rudely \" I told them to wait on you\"
A few more minutes later a guy shows up slump shouldered acting as though he's doing us a favor asks something like \"how can I help you\" 
We order water and apps. 
He doesn't say anything and walks away
10 more minutes goes buy, literally... Maybe 15... We just leave. 
WTH?!?!?  We're doing them a favor?!?
Someone else got our business"}
{"text":"When we walked in, Modern English's 'Melt with you' was playing rather loudly over the house sound system.  Everyone in there looked older than both my wife and I.  The hostess asked if we wanted to be seated for dinner or if we wanted to have happy hour in the bar area.  We chose the bar.

My wife had whatever their brown ale is, I think it's Roadrunner Brown or something along those lines.  I had iced tea.  We noticed our bar table was not clean but we let it slide as it wasn't horribly dirty.  

The waitress came and went.  When my iced tea was empty, I'd look for her and she would magically appear with a pitcher of iced tea.  Although fairly happy and somewhat charming (for a waitress in a place like this), she didn't really go above and beyond in her service but she wasn't terrible either.  

Happy hour: three dollar pints of their micro-brewed beer and three dollar appetizers.  We had wings and nachos which were good enough.  I really liked the nachos.  Mind you, happy hour portions aren't as large as regular portions but also they're only $3 bucks.  

When we were leaving Lady Gaga's \"Alejandro\" was blasting over the house sound system.  It made me think that this is the place where older people go to feel like they're still 'in tuned' with what the younger folks are up to.  I started to feel middle aged."}
{"text":"Another good meal ... this time the Housemade Meatloaf. It's a blend of turkey and sausage instead of the standard ground beef. A refreshing and delicious twist on a comfort food staple. Served over cheddar mashed and mixed veggies. The server could have behaved like she wanted to be there but everyone has a bad day once in awhile. Service was prompt just the same. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Just like Applebee's, Chili's or Fridays. Stick to the bar food (burgers, sandwiches, pizza, wings and salads) and you will be okay. 

This was our second attempt at trying Rock Bottom on Fathers Day. The first time almost ten years ago. We went in the early afternoon and they had already ran out of steaks. How do you do that on Fathers Day?! This time we went around 12 noon and beat the rush.

My wife got and loved the Berry Bash Sangria. She just said it had too much ice in it. Our daughter got the root beer float which she love and I started with a Mango Ice Tea, but later switched for a raspberry ice tea as the mango ice tea wasn't sweet enough.

We started off the the Kobe beef sliders as our app. It took at least 15 minutes to get them. You get three sliders and they were very good.

My wife got a small greenhouse salad with Jalapeno ranch dressing to start off with which she enjoyed and the lobster & shrimp enchiladas as her main entree. She complained about how salty it was and the fact that there was no lobster in it at all.

Our daughter got the kids burger and fries. No surprise there.

I ordered the New York Strip with mashed potatoes and it came with green bean as well. My strip was cooked perfectly and has a decent taste. Longhorn has a much, much better quality of steak though. The green beans were pretty good and my mashed potatoes very bland and pretty average. 

The kitchen sounded like an live episode of Hell's Kitchen. The waiters were repeatedly asking for orders at least 5 to 6 times. The kitchen was backed up the whole time we were there.

On a different note, our waitress Susan was very good. Come here for drinks and the bar food. Skip everything else."}
{"text":"Fish tacos were excellent!! Great brewed beers on tap as well!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the pretzels! Wish they would bring back the Asiago Dip, but hey, garlic salt and cabs are 2 of my main food groups. Great atmosphere, can always see a game on one of the many TVs, even when my girlfriend thinks I'm paying attention to her! Milk stout is my favorite beer, but the light isn't bad either. Something tells me the others are good too, but it's hard to get me to stray from my patterns. Oh well, I'll leave someone else to review those. All in all, the food and beer is great, and the servers seem to know what they're doing too."}
{"text":"Have been here several times. It can get loud when crowded and there can be long waits. There is a parking lot across the street that can be good. It can also have a sign saying it's full when it's actually empty, oddly enough.

Loved the fish tacos, nachos, and salad with pear. It's not as cozy as Ri Ra down the street, but that depends on what you are looking for. Service was average so won't identify the server. 

Hope to check out more restaurants in the area in the next few months."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town we happen to walk upon this place. The food was good and the service was great. The menu itself has a lot for everyone. We did sample the beer it was good just a bit warm for my taste."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews, but this visit was absolutely horrible. First off we went at 8:00 pm on a Friday. It wasn't busy at all- we were seated at a booth that was covered in this sticky film. When our server came, she had just gotten done smoking and it was very apparent when she asked us if we wanted anything to drink. It was just a rude smell that enveloped our booth. We ordered a pretzel for an appetizer. It took my husband a while to nail down what he wanted, so by the time she did come back to take our order, we figured the pretzel was going to be there soon. I also ordered a beer and it took forever to get that as well. I ordered the fish and chips, my husband ordered the 2:00 am burger cooked medium with a side of mac & cheese. When our server brought our food- because that was the only other time we saw her- we politely told her we never received our pretzel. She said she would get right in it- and she did- but brought it with our food and didn't make any advance to take a % off of our bill or anything. She said the kitchen had made a mistake by not filling the paper in the machine and that part of the kitchen was behind. I completely understand that things like this can happen- but I feel like it's the servers job to then make it nice and offer to cover your appetizer. Anyway- our food was served and husbands burger was well done- he asked for medium. We were starving at this point so there was no way we were going to send it back. Our drinks went empty and she was no where to be found and so other server came by and filled us up. It was just an annoying experience. We have never ate here before other than grabbing some beers in the bar and maybe a couple appetizers. I can tell you for sure that we will never be back to eat at the restaurant again. Just sucks because the bar is always very on top of it. We don't get date nights often because we have twins that are 2... so when we go out we always are looking for a good experience. I didn't have to cook or clean so I am thankful for that- but I just hope that they can get their stuff together so it doesn't happen to anyone else."}
{"text":"Great service. Had the sampler beer and really enjoyed it. Service was friendly"}
{"text":"This Restaurant has a nice atmosphere and great drinks but I got chicken wings with no meat on them the wedge salad was good..."}
{"text":"We stopped on in after an event at Discovery Place. It was relatively busy, as it was a Friday night, but the restaurant is huge and can accomodate many parties. They have a great bar/table area, and then more booths/tables towards the back of the restaurant. Right now they have a great deal going on for their beer samples where you get 6 samples for $5. Their menu offers a wide variety so it appeals to vegetarians, meat/burger lovers, those looking for smaller portions, and even has some good looking desserts as well. I had the waldorf chicken salad, which was pretty good. The baked apple crisps were a unique change from the norm. My husband had the 2 am burger, which comes with a fried egg, bacon and hashbrowns - it was a nice, thick burger and really appeals to you if you are hungry. The fries were ok - nothing special. Service was ok, as it took 20 minutes to get our beers delivered, but it was a busy Friday, and apparently the bar was low on glasses."}
{"text":"We were here on Sunday night and it was quiet. Service was great, waitress very friendly, food good and beer good. We sampled all the beers (look at pics I posted) and my favorite is definitely the Belgian Tripel. We will be back!
2nd review: after our 2nd visit I'm knocking 2 stars. The second visit the food wasn't great and the service beyond terrible. The restaurant was only half full so not an excuse. Don't get their flavored teas, they taste awful, and the apple juice we got with one of the kids meals tasted like it had been sitting out for a while. Don't know if we will be back after this experience."}
{"text":"You'll know when you've hit it.

(Ba-dum crash!)"}
{"text":"Went here this past weekend with about 12-15 people for a birthday celebration..we sat out on the patio and the service was sloooooooow. It honestly took a good twenty plus minutes for anyone to come by and clear the tables and then another 10 minutes to put in a simple drink order. At that time we had about six people there. 

The slow service continued all night. My glass was empty more than it was full. It was a Saturday night, and I would give them a break if the place was packed but, not so! The place was somewhat busy but, not really. You would think a server would jump at the chance to get a nice tip from a large group...Well, not really. 

He was very nice, however he forgot my beer once and two more orders from others that I know of. He did take them off the bill but, overall it was just so disappointing. 

Then we get the bill with an 18 percent gratuity, okay - but for that kind of shitty service - me thinks not!! You gotta earn it. Best part was after complaining to the manager - he adjusted our bill, and wait for it...

AFTER we paid with cash the server tracks us down in the parking lot to give us the new bill??...lol...really, keep it - we are not coming back!"}
{"text":"If I could give it less than 1 star I would. We have been to Rock Bottom several times over the years. We went Saturday, March 10th for dinner with Family that came into town to visit. We had HORRIBLE service, so much so in fact, we weren't even greeted by a server for 22 minutes. It was when we stopped someone and asked if we could order we got an eye roll and a \"hang on\". Finally our server came over and we ordered our drinks. I ordered a Miller lite and was told you don't have domestic beers b/c you're a brewery. I mentioned to the server that I've been there many times and you do have a few domestic options. He said no, we don't. I asked if we could see a manager because I was sure there was an option. He said oh yeah, we have bud light. We got our drinks from another server and eventually our original server came back to take our order. We started with several appetizers for the table. They came out after a VERY long time and were awful. Cold and the nachos were burnt. Our server never came back to ask how things were. We stopped another server to order drinks again. Finally our server came back and asked what we would like for entrees. We declined and asked for the check. No manager ever came to our table. Awful experience from beginning to end."}
{"text":"WOW. ...Amazing hand crafted cold brew...Mushroom Swiss burger. My favorite. ...and some 2$ late night Flautas...yeah ive finally found my neighborhood late night haunt. ....oy yeah..and Sports center!!! WHaaattt. ....."}
{"text":"Going to breweries and getting flights is a favorite thing to do for us. It was a hot day and we were excited to find this place. We weren't looking for it, we just ran into it in the shopping center.
We were jazzed. But, sadly the beers and the food were only ok. The service was a little crappy too. Not mean, mostly just blah, uninterested, no smiles.
I won't go back."}
{"text":"Used to be great.  Took the good stuff off the menu.... No asiago and beer bread, fish and chips changed to cod vs. Salmon.  Oh well, just will quit going."}
{"text":"Our lunch/dinner was perfectly prepared and excellent!  Loved getting my burger medium, as requested.  Claudes enchilada dish was stuffed with fresh lobster and shrimp.  Our waitress was one of the best we have come across.  We'll likely ask for her next time we stop here.  Her name is \"Crystal\"."}
{"text":"It's okay. I don't recommend the Asiago Artichoke and Crab dip since there was no crab or artichoke. I would call it more like a cheese dip."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about the few food items I've had hear. Appetizer: definitely go with the chicken nachos. HUGE (easily share between 4+ people) and great taste/toppings. My absolute favorite entree is the Lobster & Shrimp Enchiladas. I'm not a fan of black beans, so I sub out the black beans for Mac & Cheese. I consider myself a connoisseur of mac'n cheese ... and this is definitely top 5 of any restaurant I've been too.  Do yourself a favor and stop in here!"}
{"text":"I go to rock bottom for happy hour frequently. I never go for lunch or dinner. The happy hour beer is a great deal, at 18oz. for $3. The beer, itself, ranges quite a bit, but it's generally on par with standard US microbrews, with some significantly better. The food is nothing special. The service also varies a lot, so I'm not surprised to find some people got some bad service.

For people who liked the brewmaster, Guy is no longer with the company. A new brewmaster, Rob, took over, this spring. He was at this location a few years ago, then went to Scottsdale, and is now back. Personally, I like his brews better than Guy's, but others could disagree. I've been told Rob's specialty is brown ale, and I can see why.

Overall, for some decent, local beer, after work, it's a great spot. For anything else, I'd go someplace else."}
{"text":"Average is the word to describe Rock Bottom brewery. Service is good, staff is friendly, but the food is mediocre at best. 

Our most recent visit to Rock Bottom brewery was on a Tuesday night. The restaurant was not very busy. We were seated immediately and waited on immediately. 

My husband ordered a $4 flight of drinks on special. He enjoyed each one, especially the Wintercrush, which was suggested by the server. I really liked the Irish Pearl, which is a dark dry Irish stout. It had notes of smoke, wood, and coffee, which I really enjoyed. 

For my meal I ordered the ribeye, medium. It was cooked slightly medium-well around the edges of the steak. There was very basic seasoning on it, so it was just a steak. Nothing special, no seasoning that stood out. I added shrimp to my steak for $3.99. The shrimp were a severe disappointment. They were extra small shrimp, and they lacked any seasoning. They were also overcooked, so they were curled up into tight little balls. 

As for my sides I ordered the green beans (seasonal vegetable), and the apple coleslaw. The green beans were also bland. No seasoning on them at all. They could have used a little garlic or onion or something. The Apple slaw was average as well - it was a standard mayo based slaw, with a few pieces of Apple here and there. I feel like more vinegar would have brightened it up and allowed the Apple to come through more in the dish. If I had to give this meal a letter grade, I would give it a C. 

My husband ordered the fish and chips, with a side of Apple slaw. The fish was tasty, moist and cooked well. The Cajun remoulade was really good, and added a nice touch to the meal. The fries (chips) were standard fries seasoned with a Cajun season salt. I'd say his meal was better because it was better seasoned. 

All in all we had a good experience, but the food wasn't anything to get excited over. I would probably return for the pub-food and drink specials, but wouldn't come back if I were in the mood for steak."}
{"text":"The stars are only for the brews.    Badly overcooked salmon which was devoid of any evidence of the rumored Bourbon glaze.  The Grilled broccoli side was steamed   Rice had been on the steam table too long.  Best part of rhe meal was the salad even though it took two tries for the waitress to bring the right dressing.  Just walk past this place and choose anywhere else in  this \"restaurant district\"."}
{"text":"I've always been pleasantly surprised with the food I've gotten at Rock Bottom.  I say \"surprised' because with any restaurant that falls into the slippery territory of a \"chain\", you expect to find your fair share of culinary duds.  But I've really had a lot of good meals at Rock Bottom.  Now, granted, you do owe it to yourself when ordering to not forget where you are (a \"bar-straunt\" if you will), and don't get anything above and beyond this place's call of duty.  For instance, I will never be ordering the ahi tuna.  I'll leave that to my favorite sushi bars and restaurants a bit closer to the water (the Mon doesn't count.....).

But besides that, I always really enjoy my meal choices.  I've recently gotten the chicken avocado sandwich.  Chicken was grilled perfectly, plenty of avocado, and it was a good sized sandwich without being excessive.  I've also ordered the Margherita pizza, which could definitely be split between two people.  It's an eight cut that comes to you on a big wooden pizza paddle.  The pizza was really great.  The crust was crispy, it had a good balance of cheese and tomatoes, and the basil pesto was fresh and tasty.  And not greasy whatsoever - BIG bonus points there.  But my biggest surprise as of late was when I ordered their chicken flautas.  I'm a HUGE Mexican food fan and always hesitate to order Mexican outside of a Mexican restaurant for fear of being disappointed.  But I had an insatiable craving one night and decided to go for it.  It was DELICIOUS.  The flautas are deep fried which gives you an amazing crunch, and they still managed to not dry out the inner ingredients.  The accompanying rice was nice and moist as well.  I was so happy!

I've always been quite happy with the service there as well.  I go on Thursday evenings for trivia, and nine times out of ten the service is really spot on.  The ladies servicing the bar area are friendly and attentive.  Only once or twice, to my memory, has my service been sub-par, and that can usually be chalked up to an extremely packed Trivia Night with only two visible servers helping 50+ people.

I definitely give Rock Bottom two thumbs up for taking your typical chain-found food and making it fresh, yummy, and worth coming back for more."}
{"text":"This is strictly a beer review.  Happy hour looks promising though.

Looking for a man date or a sporty classy bar to escape the fam bam for a few hours?  This Rock Bottom brewery might be a good place start.

I came in at noon, and there were 4 pairs of guys drinking beer and watching ESPN highlights.  Clearly this is the place to go for the midday work lunch with a good guy friend.  Unfortunately the Cardinals got stomped on, so everyone was in a sour mood.  The local patrons were at least friendly to hide their discontent.

For ladies less inclined to drink beer, but want to try something new, I'd recommend the white ale.  For peeps that don't want Coors, get the Kolsch.  For guys, it's tough, but get a taster of the smoked porter and drink the Marzen. 

My taster rack was unbelievably inexpensive.  From lightest to darkest:

Kolsch - Light beer good crisp flavor.  I generally don't like Kolsch, but I enjoyed this little taster  

Belgium White Ale - Quite good with a lemony floral body and finish.  Best of the bunch.    

Red Ale - Not that good, lacked the ale flavor.

IPA  - Dry hoppy, not so good finish and after taste.

Special Dark Octoberfest Marzen - Decent, had some ale taste with  wheaty finish.

Bourbon Barrel Smoked Porter - Served off cask, unfortunately it was warm.  Definitely interesting, I wish it was a colder.  It's like a drinking a light whiskey.  Not very oaky like most barrel aged porters (which is good thing), you can feel the alcohol, but not taste it.  It's odd, but worth trying, just hope it is cool.  

The bartenders were quite knowledgeable about their beers, and offered advice to patrons unfamiliar with beer.

I would like to give the place 3, but there weren't any exceptional beers,  just a clear upgrade from the big American breweries.  

Stop by if its football Sunday or you want a break from a typical beerless weekday lunch."}
{"text":"We were there for about two and a half hours with a group of 10 people. The beer was good but the mixed drinks were awful. I ordered the original Mac- and- chicken. There was literally one bite of chicken in the meal. One person ordered a burger and was brought the wrong one. Three others ordered the 2am burger. They said they were out of hash browns so they substituted with one sad onion ring. The burgers were a disappointment. The server seemed to be doing her best but the kitchen was way behind and had everything backed up.  Overall the drinks were bad and the food was of low quality. We definitely won't be coming back. Rock bottom describes this place perfectly."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the post 9pm reverse happy hour pricing as we dashed over here following a Circus to catch the end of MNF. The restaurant portion was closed already, so only bar seating available. Most of the small crowd were regulars and we ran into the one Colts fan in Arizona....too bad they lost in OT buddy.
   Oh yea, the prices for most drinks and about a dozen food items were terrific. We got that full size pepperoni pizza and an odd, but tasty black bean egg roll item for only nine bucks. You also must try the vanilla coffee stout beer, which cost $3, and had a 7.6% ABV. It was a good meal and the rest of the menu looks good as well, especially the Brisket pizza."}
{"text":"I selected Rock Bottom for my birthday luncheon. Great choice among my party! We started with cocktails, the pomegranate \"holiday\" mule was a hit. Light sweetness and a nice kick from the ginger beer. My party of 16 had very different eating habits and the menu here was a hit! I had the Maker's Mark Bourbonzola burger (added bacon....mmmmm, bacon) with a side of fries. The burger was a decent size and tasty add it was topped with gorgonzola cheese and onion straws. The sauce was interesting...i used it as dip fur my fries. Since it was my birthday, I had a choice of a desert! (winning) I selected the sales carmel cheesecake and boy is it good!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, a bit overpriced for the quality / selection. They have a make your own pizza for the kids which is great and provides some entertainment. I recommend ordering it first thing though bc it does delay the rest of the order while they make it. Would go back but would like to try some non-chains in the area too. Very close to discovery place which was nice as we only had to walk a block for lunch."}
{"text":"Every time I've been here the food has always been delicious and the service has always been very exceptional. My go to is the Laredo burger and the Mac n'cheese as a side. They Mac n' cheese is absolutely wonderful if you like garlic! I've had a few other menu options as well that have been superb. The beers on tap are always great. My newest favorite is the First! Pumpkin Ale. 

One thing I really appreciate about Rock Bottom is that they aren't one of these restaurants that try to rush you out when you're done eating. The food comes out fast (which is great when you're starving!) but if you want to stay an visit with your date or eating companions there's never any rush. I was just at Rock Bottom last night meeting friends for a movie that didn't start until 11pm. We got at the restaurant around 7:30, ordered drinks, ate and had a few more drinks and then just hung out for about a half hour until it was time to Walk over to the cinemas. It was nice not feeling rushed to leave as soon as we stopped ordering.

My only complaints are that sometimes meat ends up being cooked a little more than you often ask. Medium often turns into medium well, but that's not a huge problem for me. I also don't think the signature cocktails are worth $9, but that's more of a corporate complaint since Rock Bottom is a small chain. 

Overall I definitely recommend eating here if you're in the Waterfront!"}
{"text":"I would not return here. Such a mediocre, typical \"american\" menu and the food was cold, the chicken on my tacos was like the scene from National Lampoons where the turkey was dried out, and the service was so slow. The beer is no different. Ordered their wheat \"season of the whit\" beer and it tasted like a glass of coors light with maybe an inch of a sam adams seasonal wheat poured in to it. It was SO watered down tasting."}
{"text":"Rock Bottom...don't have too much to say about this place.  Everything is just OKAY in my opinion...but then again, everyone is entitled to their own.

We arrived on a Tuesday evening, 7 pm, and was sat in a humble little corner in the back of the restaurant.  The hostess was friendly, although she did admit that the look on her face was a look of \"boredom\" (exact words, no joke), so I was a little thrown back by that.  The waitress was friendly, but didn't seem to appreciate or acknowledge much of the friendly conversation my fiance sparked up during the ordering process.

We both ordered beer.  I tried the Rocktoberfest and he had the stout.  Tasty stuff, and it seems that we got the Beer Club mug as an additional upgrade.  Nice touch.

I was slightly disappointed in the variety of menu items, and maybe that is why I rarely come here.  I ordered the Bourbonzola burger and added arugula.  The waitress had no idea what that was, and made me repeat it to her after we placed our order...hmmm...

The food came in a timely matter.  I noticed that my patty was in the shape of a rectangle...Pre-frozen I suppose?  I wish that they put extra crunchy onion strings on my burger, but they didn't (then again, I didn't ask).  The french fries were delicious.  

Overall, the experience was just OK.  Nothing fancy.  Nothing to rave about.  Nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Went to Rock Bottom at The Waterfront over the weekend with 10 adults and 3 children in high chairs. Service was good, efficient, and fast. I enjoyed a good bowl of tortilla soup and an order of Buffalo wings. Both very good. From the table, I heard rave reviews of the Ball Park Pretzel the other meals including a 2 alarm burger, a few classic burgers cooked medium as requested, mac n cheese, and lobster and shrimp enchiladas.  A very good experience."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I've eaten here since moving out of the area.  Went here the other day with my colleagues from work for lunch, and I was beyond less than impressed with our meal.  

Our service was great, a gentleman who truly hustled the whole time and kept our drinks filled (one of my biggest pet peeves when it doesn't happen!).  Because of how great he was, and the fact we were on a true time crunch, I didn't say anything about how unpleased I was with my meal.

I ordered a cup of their chicken tortilla soup, and their Chicken Waldorf salad.  Neither would I ever order again.  The soup was, in my opinion, terrible.  I don't know if it is just because I have had better, or had different expectations, but to me it was just bland, watered down and terrible.  

The Waldorf salad was whole other ballgame.  It was supposed to have all these wonderful toppings on it, and these \"toppings\" were scarce and hard to find.  There were barely any grapes on it (maybe two or three halves?), two or three large clumps of the walnuts, a small scattering of sand grain sized blue cheese, and two little apple chips on top which were old, stale and soft.  All of this on a very large and plentiful mound of (fresh, at least) salad mix.  The chicken...... ugh... the chicken.  Maybe a couple very thin slices thrown on top...which did not taste very fresh.  

This salad that I received was most certainly NOT the salad that I see other Yelpers posting.  If it had been, I'm sure I would have loved it."}
{"text":"We went on Christmas Day because it was one of the few places that was open. The waitress was wonderful, but the food was awful. I ordered the bison steak medium rare and it came out well done. The crab dip was ice cold and had nasty lumpy chunks of something that looked and tasted like plastic in it. The pork sandwich was awful, the pulled pork was a mushy mess with the consistency of runny mashed potatoes. Speaking of mashed potatoes, they were so salty they were basically in edible. I will never go back to rock bottom again, even though the beer I tried was decent, the food more than ruined the entire meal.  I am only giving them two stars because the waitress was a sweetheart and tried very hard to make up for the shortcomings of the kitchen. If it wasn't for her, they would get a zero stars review"}
{"text":"Even since Rock Bottom opened (7 years ago???) I have always thought it was a dance club.  I am not really sure why but I thought it was along the same line as (throw back) Hi-Tops but I did. I think I always thought this place was a club because of the behemoth size of the space. 

Well I was out with a friend and we needed a place to go before a show at the Improv and Rock Bottom was close. 

Part of this is my fault...I always order \"healthy\" items at places that specialize is greasy bar food...then I am upset when the meal isn't 5 star.  

I started off with one of their wheat beers, it was alright. I nursed it all through dinner so I don't think I was head over heels in love with it.  I got the Catch of the Day, Off the Hook, Fish Dish, Sailors Delight or something(I forget it had some cheesy fish themed name).  It was cod (meh, that should have been the sign not to get it) with roasted asparagus and lemon rice.  The fish was suppose to be broiled but it had a thick breading (annoyed) and the portion of fish was tiny. The rice and asparagus were great though. 

My friend got a chicken sandwich which he enjoyed although the fries were pathetic.  The fries were probably pre-cut frozen fries or just very poorly executed.  They were so thin that you have to grab a huge handful just to get any actual potato flavor.

Pros: A lot of tables (no wait), brew special beers, big menu, could hear the dueling piano bar next door

Cons: Place was fairly empty and we got a crappy table by the door when it was 5 degrees outside, most of the food was fried, cheese filled, cream based, or wrapped in bacon.  I know some people love to eat food like this all the time( I do every once in awhile) but if you eat out a lot you can't always get the spin dip, burger, and ice cream sundae.  (I would love to but its just not in my cards). I do like like when causal places offer some healthy options."}
{"text":"Rock Bottom is a unique choice at the Homestead Waterfront where there are predominately chains. I've eaten here twice, and both times I really enjoyed the beer (which is all brewed there!) but my food was average. Boneless wings are a yummy app and the beer changes seasonally, so they always have something you're in the mood for. Service is generally friendly and quick."}
{"text":"I LOVE Rock bottom. My husband and I live down the street and go here frequently. I always get a burger (99% of the time), and my husband alternates with whatever sounds good. 
We like it so much we often order for pickup on long days! 
They have great, accommodating managers, very kind, attentive staff, and a fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"_The Music on Fridays is great!  Had the appetizer tostada, two small ones but the perfect size for me. The corn tortilla was tough in the middle otherwise great.  Service was a little slow. .. They were busy."}
{"text":"Sopped by for a beer and appetizers.  Great Amber beer and the appetizers were yummy.  Our server Amina was so personable and helpful.  Very nice lunch."}
{"text":"During a visit to the queen city, I came across Rock Bottom when looking for a place to watch college football on a Saturday afternoon. I sat at the bar and was greeted by an excellent bar tender (whose name I cannot recall) and she walked me through the beer selections for the day. I think I'm getting old, because I can't remember what beer I ordered with my meal. I do remember that whatever it was it went well with my baby brats (I think there were an Oktoberfest menu item) and ahi tuna salad. Both dishes were very good and I'm definitely ordering the brats again when I visit the restaurant on another occasion."}
{"text":"We started with an appetizer of Calamari, and thus why 4 stars and not 5.  The calamari was rubbery, I would say it taste like it was frozen.  I also had a white beer, very good.  We shared the ribeye with onion rings and veggies.  The steak was cooked perfectly, and the veggies were amazing.  Since we shared we splurged for dessert and shared the carrot cake for two.  Should be for three or even four.  Great carrot cake."}
{"text":"Always a good time here. Sincere, genuine people. I've always felt respected and taken care of. I appreciate the staff and managers. Good food, but I come here for the atmosphere and people. Thanks"}
{"text":"Hubby has a thing for French Dips, so when the flier came in the mail advertising Rock Bottom's new Firehouse Specials, he really wanted to go, especially since we were in the area anyway. 

The French Dip was on a \"pretzel roll\" and my bite had soooooo much horseradish on it, I couldn't swallow it, and the bun was almost immediately mush. He also did not care for the beer \"jus\" it came with. His sweet potato hash side looked overdone and simply not appetizing. He also had an Irish stout that he really liked.  I ordered a tasty portabello and spinach sandwich on a nice wheat roll with rosemary mayo. The fries that came with it were light and yummy. I thought I had by far the better of the two meals- until I spent a good part of the rest of the night on the potty. 'Nuff said. This is a family show."}
{"text":"Great food awesome beer. Only issue is almost every employee we have encountered was exceptionally rude. From the hostess to the bar tender.. We will be going to a different location from now on."}
{"text":"Brought some friends to this place last week. It was also my first time. 

The drinks weren't that great. We ordered sangria margaritas, a Cosmo, and a mojito and none of us were pleased. 

We ordered the crab dip which was amazing. 

Our meals were like frozen dinners that just came out of the microwave. 
I asked for my steak rare, it came out well done. My sides didn't come out till I was almost done with my meal. I got rice and it wasn't cooked...

Just very disappointed in this place because the restaurant itself is nice and the service was decent"}
{"text":"Yummy!  I had the nachos with chicken.  I love that the chips came on a big plate so it felt like each chip had the appropriate amount of toppings. Loved the salsa it tasted fresh. Service was good as well and restaurant was very clean"}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill in the past year. Very disappointing. The bathrooms are dirty, the booth seats are cracked and the food that you order comes out without the ingredients that are listed on the menu. It really seems like they are struggling."}
{"text":"Great food, beer, and atmosphere! I've been here a few times and have always gotten a burger, which are always juicy and fill you up, but if you're looking for something a little nicer, their Cajun Pasta is very good. It has sausage, ground chicken and shrimp, as well as linguine, so you will leave full and satisfied. The pasta was cooked well and the cream sauce had just a little kick to give the dish extra flavor. The service here is excellent, very pleasant and attentive. As soon as we sat down we had someone taking our drink order and our food came out quickly once we ordered it, despite our group being large. The atmosphere is casual and comfortable, great for a group of friends or family."}
{"text":"This establishment was mediocre...

Our server was incredibly cranky, which really stinks, because it could have been quite the experience!  I was there with a bachelorette party, and we were all behaving ourselves...and would have left a very generous tip...had the server been kinder.

Both of the items I ordered were just okay -the Waldorf salad and faux cherry stout.

The highlight of the evening was the extra large pretzel."}
{"text":"Be warned the mini apps are made for a Barbie doll.  $6.95 for less than 2 oz of pulled meat is just really sad and feels like a rip off."}
{"text":"While I love the beer that they brew, their food is less than stellar and with their corporate office dictating local taste it is not worth it for food, Duckworth's will be opening next week and it is a better option for food and a larger selection of commercial beers."}
{"text":"I try to stay away from chain restaurants, especially bar-type joints, because the food that is delivered is overpriced, not awesome and usually available in your local supermarket in the frozen foods section. That's pretty much what you're going to get at Rock Bottom.. However, I love beer, and breweries, so Ill give in and battle the corporate whore stereotype. I teetered between the sampler platter and a burger.. but seeing as how I've consumed about 10 hamburgers withing the last 2 weeks (come on, In & Out as a hold on me, ill admit this) I opted for the sampler. It consisted of your usual Chicken fingers, Buffalo Wings, Pot Stickers, Onion Rings, Edamame and a Pretzel with Spicy Spinach Dip. All of it was edible and not bad, I mean, especially after you've consumed about 4 of their on site brewed beers (Raptor Red is my favorite), anything is delicious, but again.. typical bar food. I I must say that their happy hour is AWESOME, complete with a $3 menu. Cant beat that. I'm officially a member of the \"Mug Club\" now. Basically this means I get rewards, invited to sweet parties and, *drum roll* my very own special Mug, always waiting for me behind the bar. Kinda cool! 

I cant say I love this place, but I also don't hate it.. I know I will return, if not for the food, but for a Raptor Red for sure."}
{"text":"I ate here for brunch today. I had the three meat omelet. I thought it was pretty good. Portion sizes were pretty big as I suspected they would be. Service was pretty good too. We arrived shortly after they opened and were the only customers I believe for the first few minutes. I've eaten at Rock Bottoms in different cities and enjoyed my experiences with them each time. I would recommended this location. As an extra bonus they validated our parking which is always a bonus!"}
{"text":"On a Friday I went to Rock Bottom with some friends for their happy hour which takes place from 4-6. Our server was a spunky brunette who was very attentive and even let us sample as many beers as we liked until deciding. I ultimately decided on the Pom-berry Cosmo which was excellent. I also got the ball park pretzel which is amazing. During happy hour it's only $5 and you get two big pretzels served with this delicious cheese dip. My friends got the nachos, the quesadilla, and the artichoke cheese dip. Everything was very tasty."}
{"text":"a two-story restaurant and brewery in Ahwatukee. trapped in a amc/z tejas/barnes and noble strip mall, it's a decent place for ok decent beer and ok food.

this location's brew master is cool guy - classically trained as a chef and from the east coast. and although Rock Bottom is national chain, each brew master gets full control of the beers they make. plus, he mingles with regulars to ask what they want to drink, what they like an don't like.

they even do the equivalent of wine pairings with their beers."}
{"text":"This place has a great happy hour and great atmosphere for watching sports or hanging out. Their mug club is great offering you $3 mugs of beer and freebies every time you get a certain amount of mugs of beer! I always get their hefeweizen. Its perfect on a warm summer day! Their patio is really nice and big too all year round. The service is not bad, but it could be better. I've never been here for lunch or dinner, usually just happy hour for drinks and some appetizers. That said, there's a lot to like on their happy hour menu. A good selection of nachos, pretzels, fries, mini-stack burgers, and more at great prices."}
{"text":"Another good meal at a chain restaurant. Stopped by for lunch one afternoon and had a seat at the bar. I had the Tempura Battered Mahi Sandwich and my hubby had the Smoked Salmon Fish & Chips and it was not even a Friday. Both fish entrees very fresh and were fried to perfection. It was affordable and I believe I will be back to have the same. Sometimes there are special beers available not on the menu so ask the bartender."}
{"text":"It's been a couple years since I first reviewed Rock Bottom, and while I still don't love the place they've definitely improved since then. They admittedly still aren't my first choice food-wise because, by design, they're a pretty generic eatery for the most part, especially compared to other options in the area. Their local brews are really the only thing that sets them apart from other places in the Waterfront, and Pittsburgh has so many breweries and so forth now that even that isn't the biggest draw anymore.

That said, their brews ARE usually quite good and worth trying. Plus, they ARE improving in terms of service and quality of food, and that deserves a mention. Sure, I may think their menu of burgers, pizzas and American eats is pretty average, but I also think the quality of the dishes is improving. For example, my burgers are no longer coming to me overcooked, and as a result actually taste like a burger and not like a pile of toppings and a dry meat patty. Some dishes are even more memorable now; I actually really like their veggie burger, which is packed full of flavor that even I, a known carnivore, can appreciate. And their fresh pretzels and dip? Absolutely amazing - exactly what you'd expect from a warm pretzel fresh out of the oven. 

I was especially impressed during my last visit by a server named Mark, who was incredibly attentive and came to our table regularly to check on drinks and keep us updated. He never said a negative word and was quick to correct any mistakes or problems that popped up during the night. If Rock Bottom hires more people like him, there will be many more happy people coming and going from the place, I guarantee it.

Add in the fact that this is one of a small handful of places that accepts reservations in the Waterfront - a MAJOR plus when planning big outings with friends in the area! - and you have a reliable place where a group of people can go after a movie, shopping, etc. for food and drinks. And for that, Rock Bottom's earned another star in my book."}
{"text":"The bartenders here were very disrespectful. Bad customer service. They lost my business. After this I wouldn't come back to this establishment under any circumstances."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. The server accidently messed up my order, it happens, I would have been okay with an apology and a little extra haste getting me my correct order. Instead, the manager came out and apologized and proceeded to check up on us the remainder of the night. He hand delivered my correct meal himself and offered us a free dessert of our choice (we got the brownie one), which he personally delivered as well. It was definitely above and beyond, and went a long way with me and my girlfriend. Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Our visit to Rock Bottom was a very nice to way to end a day of travel into Charlotte.  A tasty meal, a good beer, and a nice place? Check ,check and check.. almost.

The food was good, but nothing incredibly memorable. The asiago artichoke and crab dip appetizer was very tasty, but our burgers were nothing special.  I ordered their house beer, which had a nice flavor to it and went well with the food.

The restaurant itself has a nice brewhouse/restaurant atmosphere to it.  Servers were quite nice, and the service was prompt and efficient.  Personal tip: the outside patio is great during the daytime to watch the activity of downtown Charlotte, but after it gets dark, the people walking around get a lot sketchier.  Since your tables are next to the sidewalk, some of the nighttime folks may start messing with you.  Be warned.

Overall, though, this was a nice place to go and wouldn't mind going here again."}
{"text":"I've always loved this place but after the reno it just became my absolute favorite. It is classy and fancy, the décor and layout are on point, service has always been satisfying, prices are great, food is even better and their beers are worth trying. I keep coming back to this place with family or friends. Never had a bad experience.
Please open more locations in NC or SC"}
{"text":"These folks do anything possible to get your food exactly the way you like it! The Southwest Eggrolls are amazing, bursting with flavor with fresh peppers and chicken....not greasy at all. And the IPA goes great with them!"}
{"text":"Rock Bottom Brewery is decent bet for food and drinks in Uptown.  While I haven't had a bad dish or poor service, Rock Bottom seems to be a variation on a theme: a classy Americana pub with dressed up pub fare and dark paneling.  

I agree with Stephen K.'s summary of Rock Bottom but there are some highlights to the menu.  I've had a pretty awesome quesadilla and enchiladas to the tune of $12-14 and a hearty pick-your-own toppings cheeseburger.  I love carbs, so in this aspect, Rock Bottom does not dissapoint.  The chicken fingers are so-so.  However, the fries evoke memories of your middle school cafeteria (thin cut and taste like veggie oil).

The staff are very friendly and professional; they actually make sure you're doing OK unlike wait staff at most sports bars.  I've never been treated rudely or indifferently here-I would vouch for the service any day.  What then, is the \"selling point\" of Rock Bottom.  Duh, location!  The outdoor seating gives view to a long stretch of Tryon St.  Rock Bottom is an awesome place to people-watch or grab a reasonable meal before launching an evening Uptown.  Rock Bottom is casual but not trashy, a pub that resorts to being a sports bar, and a stopping point but not a destination. If you've exhausted your rotation of Uptown restaurants and hangouts, at least add Rock Bottom to your list."}
{"text":"I went here one day for lunch... and left. It took my friend and I about 5 minutes before we were greeted by the bar tender, who noticed us looking around to see if anyone was working that day. Once we were seated it took another 3-5 minutes for our server (who acted like he didn't care to be there) to ask for our drinks. Before he could come back to order our food, we decided to go across the street to Duckworth's. Duckworth's food was hot and tasted really good. We were more than happy to leave a very generous tip. 

Pn: There was 3 parties there. One of 2, and the other of 5 and 1 guy at the bar. Maybe they were understaffed..."}
{"text":"We were a party of four. My wife and I ordered the stuffed pepper. It was very spicy with some serious zip. However, it was delicious. My youngest son had the chicken enchiladas. He thought that those were the best that he ever had. My oldest son had the chicken mac-n-cheese. He thought that it was very good. We all shared the calamari and jalapeno appetizer-- very spicy, but very good. We also had the buffalo wing appetizer. The sauce was very good, but the wings were OK. The brownie dessert was a little disappointing. The brownies were dry. I also had the key lime dessert. It was OK. The service was outstanding. The atmosphere was vibrant and enjoyable. We will definitely return the next time that we are in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This place is chill. Good drinks and good good. We went before happy hour, dang it. I would defi tell go back during happy hour to see if it's legit. The bartender was laid back and cool. The environment was relaxed and chill."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday evening and the place wasn't very busy. My family and I sat at our table for fifteen minutes and never had any of the four servers in the area stop to take a drink order, say hi, or even acknowledge my party's existence. Got up and left."}
{"text":"GREAT food.  I had the chicken fried chicken and it was so good that I closed my eyes while I was chewing...perfectly crispy on the outside and super juicy on the inside.  Everyone was incredibly happy with their food, they were easily able to accomodate our party of 11 without compromising good service."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. I have 3 regular favorite items that I switch up when going here. The Santa Fe Ranch Chicken Salad is what I order more than others, usually when I'm more in the mood for something not too heavy. I also love their steaks with Jalapeno Butter. When I'm in the mood for bar food appetizers, I order the Nachos :)"}
{"text":"Very disappointing and I worry that I will get food poisoning. My sister and I were seated quickly and the wait staff wasn't bad. However,  my steak that I ordered as rare came to me sickeningly pale grey inside and out. I've never been served such old meat that it was grey all over. The manager apologized and said we could leave without paying for it. Obviously,  I will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has a mixed Menu..I had the 2am Burger which was very delicious and I was extremely full afterwards.  It had Bacon, hashbrown and a fried Egg for the topping. ..hence the name 2am. My Mom had the Fish and chips which were also tasty.  The sauce that came with it I could of skipped. The Fries are regular shoestring fries and nothing spectacular. They do bring Malt Vinegar to the table to doctor them up. We watched the World Cup game so it was a bit busy however our food was out in 15 minutes and yes the fries were hot!.  The waiter was helpful with the menu items and very pleasant.  I will definitely be going back to try the Stuffed Peppers which came highly recommended."}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty decent. My friend and I were both still reeling from thanksgiving dinner so we ordered salads... and they were HUGE. and tasty. I liked my salad though it was slathered in way too much dressing. My friend's was even more slathered so she didn't dig it too much. We'd also ordered chips with guacamole, the guac was pretty good. my friend enjoyed her beer. I enjoyed my coke (I know, I'm lame).

so yeah... wasn't bad, wasnt the best, but it was okay."}
{"text":"Friday night date! My husband and I went to Rock Bottom in Glendale around 5:30pm. We found a high top in the bar right away and the server was quick to come over and take our drink order. My husband ordered a flight of 6 beers and I ordered the wheat ale.  After bringing us our drinks the waitress told us it was happy hour (which would have been nice to know before we ordered our drinks). We asked for a happy hour menu and ordered a guacamole (which she told us was on happy hour). After a while our guacamole came out but no happy hour menu. We understand our waitress was busy because it was pretty packed so we forgot about the menu and just ordered from the regular menu. 
My husband ordered the veggie burger and I ordered the BBQ chicken salad with no chicken and no cheese. 
My husbands burger was delicious! I was super jealous especially because my salad came out drenched with a some kind of cream dressing on it that was not advertised in the menu. I didn't want to send it back and wait for another salad so I ate a bit of it (which was good) but I gave the rest to my husband. 

Overall our experience was ok. The service was a bit forgetful but we all have off days and it was very busy. I was disappointed to get a salad dressed in something that wasn't advertised but I have no complaints about my husbands burger. On happy hour our total came to $38.00 not including tip. Not bad. 

We will probably come by again but next time ask more questions and be more specific."}
{"text":"My husband and I heard through friends it was a good place to go WELL it is not it took us 7 mins. To get seated and another4 minutes to get drinks and the couple got seated got their drinks and we were still over looked by this time it was about 20 mins. Hubby lets go I hold on and we got our ice tea the waitress came and took the couples order and I said that's it let's go!!!  The host said is something wrong I said Horrible service and I didn't even pay for the ice tea!!!!   Don't go not a good place"}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday afternoon.  Wasn't busy at all, yet our service was incredibly slow.  The waitress was a sweetheart, but they were obviously under-staffed.  I ordered a sandwich with added-on onion rings for $1, but they brought me FOUR burnt, way-overcooked onion rings.  After I pointed this out to the waitress, she said \"Oh well, they weigh them out, that's how the come.\"  No offer to bring new ones, no comp off of our bill for the up-charge, despite them being totally inedible.  The place obviously needed a good cleaning as everything was sticky and had cigarette ash all over the tables and chairs.  Also, being served with silverware and napkins is usually helpful, which they did not do, so we just stared at our food while they took 5+ minutes to bring out our silverware.  Oh well, never again will I eat here!"}
{"text":"Waitress made it clear in front of us she didn't want people in her section. She came to get our order and was nice. I ordered prime rib medium and it came rare. Sent it back and it came back medium rare. Mac and cheese was alright, I have had better. Not worth the price of our meal."}
{"text":"Extremely condescending management, upon entering the near empty restaurant our party of 6 was delayed 15 minutes due to \"extremely high flow\" whatever that means. We promptly walked to the bar and ordered a few drinks. The only redeeming factor of this place was the bartender. Despite calling us \"massholes\" she was personable and efficient. We ended up seating ourselves due to extremely slow service. We were foraging for ketchup bottles as we were waiting for one or the wait staff to talk to our table. After one beer my friend was approached and patronized with a glass of water the management \"happened to have found\" after walking out of the bathroom. After all of this hoopla we had an okay meal, decent burger, good Mac and cheese. Would definitely never recommend this place to a friend please find a different place to find dinner."}
{"text":"I went to the famed Rock Bottom the other night, Friday Dec. 2, 2011 to celebrate a good friend's birthday.  We ended up getting there around 7:45pm on a Friday night to find the place very alive with people, both young and old, carousing, socializing and being merry.  

My friends and the party I was attending were stationed in the bar area, to the left as you walk in.  Though there was a jumble of people standing around drinking and talking, a server promptly noticed we were new to the scene and took our drink orders and provided us with a menu to look over.  I ordered a \"light lager\" for my girlfriend and a \"Brown Ale\" draft for myself.  Draft beers were running $4 per pint on Friday night; which certainly isn't bad, but isn't a deal by any means. 

As evening turned into a chilly night, the people I was with found a few tables in the bar area and placed food orders.  I ordered, the BBQ pulled pork sliders as an appetizer, and some sort of lobster and shrimp rolled into a black corn enchiladas.  As a devout BBQ lover, I found the sliders to be an extreme disappointment.  The BBQ was border-line cold and there was very little BBQ on each of the sliders.  As for the enchiladas, the appeal of my meal was more in the uniqueness of the dish than its actual taste.  It's not that the enchiladas were bad, they just left me wanting more.  My girlfriend got the steak with mashed-potatoes and green-beans.  I thought the steak was above par.  My girl friend said it was cooked to her specifications.  

Overall, I felt the food was good not great, and the BBQ sliders were not up to BBQ code.  However, Rock Bottom offered the perfect ambiance to enjoy myself and my friend's birthday in splendid fashion.  The service WAS GREAT!  I wish I could recall my server's name, because I would love to give her a shot-out.  Despite the chaotic atmosphere that reigned throughout the bar, she was prompt, polite and accurate with everything.

TIPS: *Nice, classy atmosphere, *Nice seating area outside  *Parking can be found by turning either way on 7th street, including in the garage attached to Rock Bottom itself (KEEP YOUR TICKET!!  BRING IT IN WITH YOU!  ROCK BOTTOM VALIDATES PARKING, SEE THE HOSTESS.)  *Stay away from the BBQ Sliders  *Great, friendly service  *Good for parties or pre-gaming before going out somewhere else"}
{"text":"Eh. 

They're open until 2am.  That's about the only above average thing they have going for them in NW Phoenix.  Probably the weakest Rock Bottom I've visited.  

Everything is average or below average.  The prices are too high for what you get unless you hit happy hour.  With Yard House setting the bar in this genre, this place just looks weak.

Food quality ranks at bar food to me.  Servers don't seem to be paid or managed well.  Upgrades are needed all around."}
{"text":"Beer - Many choices and micro-brews (I dont drink beer, but if you do, there is lots here)
Salads - Meh
Burgers - Good
Wine - Meh
Coffee - Meh
Soup - So/so
Tex-Mexish dishes - were actually ok
Stuffed bell peppers - actually quite good

This isn't my kind of place, but we stop in for lunch now and then because it's downstairs from where we work. When you walk by outside, the smell of the brewing is so strong!

I say A-OK, because it's not my style, but it is a good micro-brewery with burgers, fries etc. The stuff you expect. Lots of seating and service is A-Ok. They have a nice patio as well."}
{"text":"Hubby and I decided to give this place another go.. Came back in 2010.. It was so bad.. Now in 2016 
It has done a 180! So much better!! Better food
Better service 
Amazing beers 
This is now our go to place. Great for kids.. 
This is our once a week date night go to place... 
Nachos are a must 
Street tacos are yummy too!!"}
{"text":"Sadly this was my first and last visit to this Rock Bottom location. Our server was not attentive to us or ensuring we had what we needed, but was focused on flirting, lingering, and laying all over a few male customers to which she was not assigned because they appeared to be dressed as though they were wealthy. The food was bland and tasteless; the macaroni was not full cooked and was not even at an al dente texture, which would have been acceptable. We ordered a growler to go- which the waitress failed to put in because she was so focused on returning to entertain those male customers which caused us to have to order the growler again and wait for it and the second check to be generated, in between her flirtation time that is. Sadly disappointed in this location seeing as how it is the oldest brewery in Charlotte it would have been a nice location to return to."}
{"text":"Waitress was pleasant and there was no wait. Our food arrived to the table quickly. I ordered the steak and portobello salad. It was fantastic. The steak was superb. I'm pretty picky when it comes to ordering a good steak. The meat was tender and cooked to perfection with no gristle or fat. It was definitely quality. It's a really nice atmosphere and located in the hub of the waterfront just a hop and skip to live entertainment at sing sing. I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Decided to try another Micro-Brewery close to home. Should have gone to SMBC. Tried the Lemonade Blueberry Whiskey adult beverage, disappointing- tasted like lemonade but 0 alcohol. Sampled the jalapeño bacon poppers nothing noteworthy. The Santa Fe salad was tasty and had a little kick. Unfortunately that's all the good on our visit. The manager spent his time with a girl patron who might have been the girlfriend. Once she was gone split his time with the hostess or hiding out in the tank room. One waitress serving the bar tables left our glasses empty more than full. Not a good way to make money as a bar or restaurant. While I'm never in a hurry no one here wasn't interested in earning our repeat business or too much of the money we came to spend. If your looking for better service don't sit in the bar."}
{"text":"After seeing a movie at the Imax in the mall we got hungry and wanted to wet our whistles with some drink, so we stopped in to check out Rock Bottom.  Rolling with a crew 4, we noticed the crowd was older, 50's/60's.  I ordered the fish and chips, husband order a steak dinner.  Friends order a albacore burger, and cheeseburger meal. All food was ok, except for the albacore burger.  It looked really weird, if it was albacore tuna it was burned to crap.  From what I saw it looked like it was brown almost like a veggie burger.  My friend said it tasted really funny so we made her complain to the waiter before eating any more of it.  Our waiter was very nice and apologized for the quality and said she could order any meal on the house.  She ended up getting mac and cheese and was happy with that.  We all got drinks but one of the star drink orders was a sampler of all their beers they brew.  For under 7 bucks you get like 8/4oz beers. In tasting glasses.   Good deal so you can get a great overall sample of what they've got to offer!"}
{"text":"Friday 1pm.
IPA as usual hits the spot.
Bison prairie burger was cooked just the way I like it slightly pink with plenty of flavor. Next time I'll request lettuce and tomato."}
{"text":"First time here.  We had a large group out on the patio.  We were preoccupied with ourselves and we're, I'm sure, a lot for our server to handle.  But Darcy was fantastic.  Just about everything was perfect.  The beers are also to be recommended.  Next time I'm in the area I'll be back.  (They are also on the home Brewer's discount plan if you are an AHA member)"}
{"text":"Their Happy Hour is the only thing that brings me back here. The food is good and cheap for happy hour. The service and beer and something that you never know what you're gonna get... 

I've ordered the Summer Honey Ale on 3 separate visits:
1st vist = delicious! Smooth and sweet, but almost flat. 
2nd visit = I swear they didnt give me that same beer, tasted bitter and like their Hefe...
3rd visit = The tap is out!
My boyfriend has had similar inconsistent beer experiences. He LOVES beer and he actually had to return a stout because it was disgustingly off. He's ordered 2 red ales in the same night and they both tasted noticeable different from each other. 

The service is minimum. They do what they gotta do to get the job done. They'll be efficient at first and then they disappear and rarely check on you by the end, so weird!!! One time we got there when there was an hour of happy hour still. We sit down, put in our first round of happy hour beers and apps in - all is well - but. .... after delivering food and drinks and after the remaining hour rolled by, they never came back to ask for last happy hour call. Luckily 10-15min after the happy hour ended they came back and knew they didnt ask so they honored the happy hour price. 

Other than that, if you are looking for a cheap happy hour night out and decent bar food then it's worth it. The beer and service is a mystery experience though!"}
{"text":"The food is a tad better than okay. The service is somewhat mixed, it depends who you get for the evening. Some are more motivated than others. The manager, Summer :-), is awesome. Ask her if you need anything or have tips for her to inspire you to come again. If I do a food business, I will

We love the free wifi. A must for any locale these days. The bear is GREAT. Love the micro brews. 

A note in general: somebody get a grip on the fish prices in Arizona please. The only healthy omega3 and protein source we all need, instead, yes yummy but unhealthy quesadillas are cheap. Something's wrong here. Most locations throughout the valley still don't take enough advantage of the promotional built in coupons Yelp has to offer to attract new and keep old customers.

The five different music styles running non stop in the desert ridge outside area mixed with every store's individual out put is nerve wrecking.

A few big plants and bushes along the iron fence would create a more natural and soothing setting. Atmosphere is half the rent."}
{"text":"Server was obviously in the weeds. Neglected to greet our table for 15 minutes, we felt very rushed so we hurried and ordered beers which he brought in 5 minutes, then it took another 20 to come back and take our order. Seems like a cool spot, the shit service kind of killed it though."}
{"text":"The food is standard American fare--a bit overpriced in my mind--and the beers range from mediocre to very bad.  The Kölsch is the only decent beer of the bunch.  The service is good, but the wait for food or a table can be quite long (generally 20-30 minutes even for just beer and apps).  I've been to the one at the Denver airport as well, but I was stranded and had free meal tickets, so okay-but-nothing-special pizza from Rock Bottom it was.  Since it's a recognizable national chain, I think of places like this as more of a tourist brewery rather than a true Pittsburgh craft-brew experience."}
{"text":"Had great service from James made us feel welcome!!! Great IPA !!! Well done.
The appetizer platter was great.
Great for a Sunday foot ball game"}
{"text":"My Fiancee and I were in town for the weekend and went here for drinks. The staff was so unprofessional! They were talking loud and laughing the entire time which was quite annoying. They were also eating from the same plate, each taking a bite from the same sandwich (Gross) 4 total workers including a guy. They were making fun on the carryout food that was being picked up by door dash. This was disturbing because I sure didn't want to order food after witnessing this.  I will not be patronizing this place again while in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here last weekend, it was really good.  We were just going to sit at the bar and have a drink but someone ordered pizza next to us and it looked awesome.  We ordered a pizza and new people sitting next to us started asking us about the pizza.  The food was good, the bar tenders were nice and the beer was good.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Food was ok but the beer was very good.  The service was rather poor and considering how empty the place was I would have expected a much more attentive waitress. I like the building and the open space is nice, too bad it's way down in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"Having lived close by for a few months, I finally made it over to this brewery this evening. Overall, I would give it 2.5 stars if I could... 

Because it was a Sunday, the typical football watching pub crowd was upstairs at the bar, making a bit of noise. I can appreciate that, so it wasn't a big deal.

I'm not a fan of beer, but seeing as how I found myself in a brewery, I felt like I should try their sampler. Nearly all of them were unbearable to me. No real surprise there.

The food started off pretty well. Their house salad was surprisingly delicious. I recommend the vinaigrette. The Loredo burger, however, left much to be desired. Guacamole was decent, but the whole thing just didn't seem like it meshed well. Also, their kettle chips are only okay.

Service was perfect, however. The waiter was easy to talk to and knowledgeable at least about their beers."}
{"text":"Went to Rock Bottom with a large party - about 50 people.  They were very accommodating.  The servers were both friendly and helpful.
The food:  I had the pulled pork sandwich.  It was very good with a little bit of zing to it.  My teenage daugher had the mac and chicken and loved it.  Someone else in our group had the Kobe sliders (listed as a starter) and said they were great.  If you go, get the ball park pretzels - great dipping sauce.
The beer:  Great choice of beers.  We had the Beligan White Ale and it was outstanding.  Went down real smooth - too smooth.  Finished off a couple of pitchers in the blink of an eye!
The atmosphere:  It is a fun casual place.  It wasn't too noisy despite being pretty crowded.  The bar area has several TV's.  
The prices:  Prices were reasonable.
The service:  Service overall was good.  One table of our group didn't get their food for over an hour.  While that was not good, the manager took care of things once it was brought to his attention and provided them with free desserts.
I'm not from around Phoenix and have never been to Rock Bottom before, but if I'm back in the area, I would return."}
{"text":"We came on the night of a car event. Very poorly marked parking, bitchy staff when we pulled into the wrong parking lot, a guy sitting in a lawn chair on the sidewalk with legs stretched out blocked the only entrance side walk. Had to walk in the parking lot off the curb and around him to get in the restaurant where we paid $10.39 for a happy hour glass of Fourteen Hands wine that coat a whopping $8.99 a bottle at BevMo or Frys down the road.  Might want to work on signage, control of handicap access during events and wine pricing - oh and we had to ask for the football game to be turned on in the bar on a Thursday night - can we say \"duh\"  oh and the waitress had the personality of a spoon - we tipped her 20% anyway"}
{"text":"Came here for Fathers Day. Reservations were made easily and we arrived and sat down right away. Our server went to start us off with drinks and was not knowledgeable at all about their alcohol selection. He didn't even know what a shot of whiskey was. Our appetizers were delicious. The meals were okay - not fantastic, but mediocre. Our server forgot about us several times and we had to ask for the same thing multiple time throughout the night. Price was kind of steep for the service and food quality. Would go back, but not on the top of the list."}
{"text":"Came to this place last night after shopping!
Food was pretty good! Service was good. 
Sat outside. Nice space!"}
{"text":"Date of Visitation: 11/21/2017 around 2:00pm
Reason: Afterwork Drinks

(i) Sampler - Premium - $4 Flight Tuesday - So, I only got BEER while I was there, but the beer chosen by the bartender + the bartender + the \"eccentric and family-like\" atmosphere + price of the flight = FOUR STARS by far. I can't remember the five (5) beers sampled, but they were all tasty craft beers. 

The only downside was the smell of the place and some of the drunk patrons that were making a scene by being mildly belligerent. 

All in all, I would definitely go back for the drinks and I MIGHT try the food. I really didn't see anything that peaked my interest. 

--TrizzyO_o"}
{"text":"I must say- this place, the food was really, really good. I probably would have given it 4 or 5 stars on the food alone. I ordered the grilled bruschetta chicken. Juicy and flavorful - excellent with the tomato and mozzarella. My friends' dinners looked really good as well- I had a bite of the bacon, chicken mac and cheese and the country fried chicken. Excellent food all around. 

The problem with this place was our waitress in particular. Korin. She started off really sweet and cool.... And then went B*TCH on our table of 6. A bunch of rude comments and all and all unpleasant experience. My friend had ordered the house root beer before and when she took a sip this time, the root beer was flat and watered down. When the waitress was told, she immediately got defensive and said \"it's our house root beer\" so excuse me, it is supposed to be watered down and flat? My friend then said she had the root beer before and it tasted different. The waitress decided to blame the soda machine and check and get her another. 

Her second mistake was when she came over to take our orders and said she would start with ladies first, the first lady she was talking about was chatting and the waitress said, \"um, can someone tap her...\"

The last and final mistake was that she mixed up all of checks or credit cards, I don't know what happened because when our cards were returned to us, we all had been charged the wrong bills! She didn't seem to know what to do, except suggest to run the cards again. But BLAMED US for the mix up and that we put our cards in the wrong bill. No! Rude rude rude!!!!

On our way out, I guess she had told the manager to cover her own behind. 

I would go back for the food and that's about all I was happy with."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Rock Bottom. I enjoyed the inexpensive beer sampler. The main reason we went  here though was for my fiance to try a specific burger. Unfortunately that burger was \"86'd\"... as was her second choice. We weren't told that until 10 to 15 minutes after ordering, which delayed our dinner. Otherwise what we got was OK. We went for a second time with some friends to watch a Panthers game, and, again, it was just OK. i tried a third time and not only did our food take a long time, but it was clear that mine was made first and had just been sitting out because nothing was warm. Three strikes and you're out in my book. I will not be going back. If you do go, I recommend going when it isn't busy (as it was with my first and third experience)."}
{"text":"I never go uptown just to eat here, but if I'm already uptown I come here frequently.
Their beer is OK and they have all of the bases covered to suit beer tastes.
Their menu covers many styles.  I had the shrimp enchiladas the other day and it really hit the spot.

I've been here with groups and have received good service and the checks have always been accurate and the food is always served with a smile.
Parking is convenient in the lot right below and they validate."}
{"text":"Tom and I decided to try this place out before catching a late movie on a Saturday night. He is a beer buff, and neither of us had ever been there, so we gave it a go.

We walked in around 8pm and we were told that there would be an hour long wait. We put our names on the list and went shopping around the area. About 25 minutes later, our table was ready. Parking was a cluster since the lot is shared with Dave & Busters and a karaoke bar called Sing Sing. Tom dropped me off at the door so I could secure our table.

Our server, Jackie, approached me almost immediately and brought two waters to the table to start. She was very attentive and funny, and probably the best part of our experience at the restaurant. Tom ordered a Red Ale and to his surprise, didn't care for it. Jackie gave Tom three free samples of beers she thought he would like after talking to him about his beer drinking habits. He loved all three, and chose the most bizarre (and expensive) beer. Jackie switched the Red Ale to the beer of Tom's choice, and charged us for the less expensive beer. Very nice of her!

We started out with the Ball Park Pretzels with Jalapeno dip. The pretzels came out quickly and they were very fresh, not to mention huge! We only ate one and took the other to go. Very good app though! 

Tom ordered some sort of bacon cheeseburger, and I got the Chicken Fried Chicken, which was a pounded chicken breast, breaded and fried, over white cheddar mashed potatoes with a side of gravy and some apple coleslaw.  Tom's burger came with a small handful of fries, and my meal was very spread out on my plate, like something was missing. Not very good presentation at all. The food itself was okay, nothing to write home about. The potatoes were my favorite part. Tom said that his burger was mediocre.

Another note: The bathrooms are shared with the Sing Sing karaoke bar that is in the same building, so expect drunk singing women in the bathrooms and brides-to-be puking in the stall next to you after enjoying too much alcohol at their bachelorette party... Yuck.

Overall, we might come back for the beer and service, but not for the food. And DEFINITELY not to use the bathroom..."}
{"text":"Meh, indeed.  Decent beer and excellent service. But it's chain food and it didn't do much for me."}
{"text":"I had a great experience, of course I was with my favorite group of moms so how can I not have a good time.  We were about 20 twin moms  and the restaurant had our table ready and Josh our server was on top of everything.  The appetizers were delicious.  My glass of wine was very good.  Of course, wine makes everything better and isn't it considered healthy?"}
{"text":"A good friend and I met here for dinner on Saturday night. The place had an average size crowd for a weekend, and our server was prompt and very nice. The food was just \"meh.\" Nothing that dazzled and nothing that stood out. For the price, I should have had a lot more food on my plate, and served to look more appetizing than it did. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight with friends, party of 6. I just had to come home and write a review on the great dining experience. The food was excellent! Our waitresses, Jessica and Arizona, were fabulous. They had such great personalities and 5 star attitudes. They made our evening and dining so much fun.

I was impressed when I asked for a to-go box and they brought me a cardboard type box. Hats off to this restaurant manager for going green. No Styrofoam containers here."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I headed over to Rock Bottom after Fleming's Steakhouse said it would be a 45 minute wait. In the quest for a yummy burger we gave Rock Bottom a chance. He ordered the appetizer nachoes (for happy hour they were 5 bucks) and that order was HUGE. I had the classic burger which was not part of the happy hour special but definitely satisfied my craving. The service was quick and friendly so we will definitely be back to try their Wednesday $10 special for a pizza and pitcher of beer :D"}
{"text":"You definitely cant beat the $3 appetizers and beer during happy hour!"}
{"text":"Ordered one of their burgers recently, however was unimpressed- by size, flavor, and overall quality.  Seemed like a regular cheeseburger I could have ordered from cook out for a third of the price. This was a fourth visit and each time the quality in food and service seems to decline a little more. But the beers are good!"}
{"text":"Very good food nice atmosphere and great tasting beer!Try to get there once or twice a month"}
{"text":"Had drinks and apps here a few years ago and it was great.
Had a late lunch a few weeks ago and it was meh. The pretzels were covered in salt to the point that it was not enjoyable. Had to scrap it all off. The cheese provided was good though.

Fish and chips were decent but nothing exciting. Probably would pass up going again!"}
{"text":"FiNALLY! A restaurant in Charlotte that makes up for all the bad ones. Their burgers are to die for. BEST BURGER IN CHARLOTTE! I had the Bacon Mac N Cheese which was really good but wow...my husband had the bourbonzola burger and it was delicious. 

The appetizers are good too plus if you go to the Blumenthal Center for the Performing Arts and take your show ticket you get a free appetizer!

This is one of my new favorite places! 

Thank you, Rock Bottom, for restoring my faith in Charlotte restaurants!"}
{"text":"Was excited to find a Rock Bottom in the Phoenix area, but were sadly disappointed in the service from both the host and server. Multiple mistakes followed by no responsibility for them don't mix well  in the service industry. Management was very kind in fixing issues, but we will not be returning as the brand has lost all appeal."}
{"text":"Last night's visit to Rock Bottom convinced me that we will not be returning anytime soon.  Service is always friendly and competent but the kitchen/food quality slides down a notch with every visit. My soup came out barely lukewarm, they \"burned\" my husband's chicken fried chicken so by the time the 2nd effort came to the table, my pulled chicken tacos were stone cold on soggy tortillas and totally tasteless.  Thanks goodness I had a BOGO entree coupon and it was free- it certainly wasn't worth paying for."}
{"text":"I always enjoy Rock Bottom. Standard beers on tap are always great and their rotating selection usually has a hit as well. 

I prefer the bar seating as to the dining room, but this is a good way to separate the family dining from those of us without kiddos. 

Nachos, nachos, nachos. Truly the best in the area. Great burgers, chili and salads. Really...I don't think I've had a bad meal here. Nice outdoor seating in the summer. 

This is a great place to watch a game or just hang out. Iced counter at the bar to keep your drink cold.  I know they have other cocktails here, but I can't order them at a beer place. I've seen them and they do look good, but I'm stuck to the beer selection. 

They have a great happy hour and specials throughout the week. 

Service is always great whether there are two or 10 of us."}
{"text":"Rock Bottom is a chain restaurant that with its own inhouse brewery. The menu as such, offers comfort-style appetizers and meals that pair up with those inhouse beers.

This location is busy. Busy busy busy. So busy that you have to park across the parking lot and walk what seems like one or two blocks to the restaurant. It's probably not that far, but this place is hummin during peak hours. 

As busy as it is, the restaurant does a good job turning tables and even though you might have to wait, the wait is never really that long.  The staff itself is well trained and quite pleasant.  They're good at explaining any questions you have and very quick to offer a beer that pairs well with what you've ordered.

If you have a bigger party or a celebration, the restaurant does offer a banquet room of sorts.  Along with your own servers, the room is fairly spacious and also a little bit away from the main dining room just in case you want to be a little loud."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and even better service!! Nachos with chicken is best is town. Sangria margarita is yummy.  You have to check this place out. Ask for Ryan-amazing!! Can't go wrong here-especially if Ryan is helping you."}
{"text":"Took my husband here and we simply had stellar service, amazing food and wonderfully crafted beers.  The staff went over and beyond to interact with us, including the bartender who was behind the bar with two tables in between where we were sitting. There was even some sort of traveling sports school event there with around 75 or more college students ordering at the same time as us, the place was extremely busy in all areas yet there wasn't a server or tender without a smile on their face, or a personality shining through. I must say. We had one of the best experiences we have ever had out anywhere in NC there at rock bottom. We were having such a good time when we paid the check we ordered 2 more drinks because we didn't want to leave.   I would highly recommend this restaurant and the jalapeño poppers!"}
{"text":"I'd never been to this location before. With a Yard House, Wolfley's, and a BJ's in the same lot, there is enough competition of the same style place that I would have thought it to be par with those. Or maybe this is something different altogether, which explains the lack of charisma and personality :/

We went in for a late lunch (2 p.m.) on a Thursday. Besides our party of two, there was a family of 4 in the dining room and 2 guests in the bar area. We were seated by a waiter that hasn't learned to smile, served by the same smile-less waiter, and otherwise we only saw a bartender on staff during the visit. 

The menu seemed to have plenty of choices, but we kept it light and simple. My friend ordered the sliders, medium, and they came out well done with absolutely no toppings or sauces or cheese. Is that normal? She dealt with it. I ordered the lemon rice that was missing anything tasting lemon-y and the black beans that actually had a nice spice to them. We had iced teas, which we were drinking quite quickly since they were weak enough to taste more like water, and I think it made the server upset to have to refill them so many times.

Weird experience for an empty chain restaurant.....I would think a server and kitchen staff stuck on that shift would want to make enough of an impression to bring people back at that same time in the future :/  Meh :/"}
{"text":"Wonderful service on the patio tonight. Had the greenhouse salad which was perfectly plated, crisp, fresh, and delicious! Waitress was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Last night my mom and I decided to try a new restaurant. This was our first time visiting Rock Bottom and thanks to our server chase we will be back! We were created by him in a timely manner, you could tell he was busy, but he made it very clear he knew what he was doing! We put in our appetizer straight away, we got the traditional buffalo wings (YUM!!!) after we were done we put in our entrees. I got the jambalaya without the shrimp and my mom got the classic burger. Our food was cooked to perfection!! Thank you Chase for making our first time at the Rock Bottom restaurant a wonderful time!"}
{"text":"We went in on a Steelers home game Sunday. It was pretty quiet inside. The staff seemed sleepy but were polite.
We ordered firecracker shrimp which came out over cooked and Luke warm. The sauce was only put on one shrimp. One. So basically we got breaded shrimp.  My spouse ordered a Rock Bottom classic burger well done. She was served a burger so well done it looked like charcoal. The cheese on top was even burned. Yuck! I got shrimp and lobster enchiladas. One enchilada had maybe a drop of enchilada sauce, the rest were dry and crusty. Yet again, overlooked. Don't eat here. Just drink."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Rock Bottom.
There are several dishes that are MONEY.
Appetizer:  Seared Ahi, Spinach Artichoke Dip
Entree :      Fire Steak, Pub Tips or Chicken Fried Chicken.
Desert :      Carrot Cake (to die for)
Bar food:     Pizza or ball park pretzels.  Both of which are sprayed with brown ale.  
Half the menu is really good, the other half is great.  
The beer is good.  Ask for the sampler!  They usually have a velvet and something on cask.  Ask for one of those if you are looking for something different.  They will also have a scotch ale, an IPA, whiskey stout or other specialty depending on the mood of the brewer (which, if its still Matt, the mood is GRUMPY).   If Andy is still working there, he is sure to please and Molly is great in the cocktail area.
Head over to Sing Sing after dinner and its a wrap.
I used to work there several years ago and I make it a point to hit every RB I possibly can.
Don't go to the one in Charlotte though, its not really a Rock Bottom."}
{"text":"I like bottom but I like there older menu better. For example I miss the sausage meatloaf vs the new turkey one they replaced it with. Doesn't wow me like the other did. They lose a star with this updated menu."}
{"text":"I admit that I don't drink beer.  And yes, this is a brewery.  I've heard they have good beer, but what I'm reviewing now is their food.  

And their 'appetizer' food is pretty darn amazing. (Although expensive as chain food goes)

I can heartily recommend their pub tips (beef in a nice thick brown sauce with mash potatoes).

And if you stay even just a short while (to enjoy a cold one or something) you have to at least try their Asiago cheese dip.  I've had this several times with my wife, and it's amazing.  It's served warm, with bits of small sliced bread to dip in the sauce.  It compliments a quiet conversation quite nicely.

They have bar seating with TVs, or quieter 'booth' seating that is more appropriate for families or quiet dates with your significant other.  

If you like people watching (and it's cool out) they have outdoor seating that faces the interior of Desert Ridge, and also has nice views of a fountain.

They may have a line in the evenings, but it's generally worth the wait."}
{"text":"An amazing experience. An extra large beer selection and so many beers on draft. The menu is huge and a great selection of burgers, tacos, chicken and steak. The quesadilla app. was amazing and the chicken fried chicken was filling and cooked perfectly and if you love Mac and cheese they have a huge dinner entree that is perfect for you. It's downtown Charlotte so you have a lot of business workers and it's gets pretty loud so don't bring the kids no kids menu. But the beer and cocktail menu was amazing and definitely had a fun time and can't beat $3 drafts"}
{"text":"One of my favorite weekend places. Big fan of the chicken nachos, best in the burgh. I prefer to sit at the high top tables because there is always a wait. Service is on par with most restaurants the hostesses do smile though. I personally prefer the Red beer. Oh yeah get the chicken nachos lol."}
{"text":"Total... service... breakdown!  I waited the obligatory 30 minutes on a Friday night so that my 2 boys and I could duck in for dinner (the make-your-own pizza is a kids favorite). When our buzzer buzzed, I took it up and the gentleman at the front said it must have malfunctioned.  My BS meter went to 10 as we waited for another 10 minutes for a seat.  Once seated, the waitress took a ton of time to get our order, and then for some inexplicable reason didn't enter our order until the first kids meal came out to the table - spanning at least 45 minutes from sitting to serving.  Maybe it was a bad night, I could hear constant service and kitchen screw-ups from the party of 10 behind us.  Food quality was bad on top of this... burger bun was hard, pizza dough was crusty *before* they cooked it as my son was making his pizza... the only thing they didn't screw up was my beer.    

Although the wait is comporable, I will pick Yard House at the other end of Desert Ridge next time.  I'll stick to Rock Bottom on the West side at Arrowhead, which has never let me down."}
{"text":"Decent IPA, I prefer Four Peaks.  Slow service.  Food is overpriced."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, this one just doesn't have that plastic feel! I love their selection of beer, and as one reviewer mentioned before me, the temperature is fabulous! They also have a great selection of appetizers and desserts. If you are just looking to knock back a few, and enjoy yourself, find your way here immediately!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for a chain.  Very conveniently located in the Desert Ridge Marketplace... very yummy salmon and rice and very yummy beer.

A little dark inside tho."}
{"text":"This is a hit or miss kinda place. (Service not food) Most of the time it is great. We love their nachos. We come in during mid day for a \"snack\". We share the half order of nachos and it feeds us well. I don't care for IPA's but I see a lot of people order them. I do however like the other choices and indulge in a few now and again. We have ordered many items and nothing has let us down. We will come back for our monthly visit."}
{"text":"Came to this place two years ago and loved it- couldn't wait to go back. Went back on Friday evening and had an awful experience. After we were seated, no one approached us for a good five minutes. Finally, a nice man took our drink order and told us that our waitress, Jessica, was busy but she would be there to take our order in a minute. After 10 minutes, Jessica finally came. Her \"greeting\" to us was, \"Do you guys know what you'd like?\" Placed our order and didn't see Jessica again for the rest of the night until we were ready for the check. No re-fills, no checking up on us, nothing. Also, I was brought the wrong entree, but it's not like Jessica was around for me to tell. Terrible experience."}
{"text":"Rock Bottom indeed. At least that is the level of service you can expect at this location.

We went with our usual girls night out crew and sat outside on the patio. We sat for 15 minutes before a server even came over which was ok since we were chatting but we sure got thirsty. A server came over and asked if we had been helped yet and when we said no she said she was likely not going to be our server, but she'd take our drink order. Turns out, she was our server for the night. We could have done better serving ourselves at that rate. It took another 12 minutes to get our drinks. So yes, we were there 27 minutes before a beverage hit our table. Not a good start but this was my friend's choice as it was her birthday so I didn't complain.


Ultimately, it took our party of 5 more than 2 hours to eat dinner at Rock Bottom. We had 3 different appetizers which we took advantage of the happy hour prices. We had to remind the server that we were to get the 1/2 price appetizers when she brought our check. We had to beg for refills of drinks, ask where our dinners were, and it was like pulling teeth to get service. The food was ok at best but really the service was so horrible that I wouldn't recommend this place to an enemy.  

Save yourself the hassle. There are plenty of places who do want your business enough to treat you right. It's funny too because the place was packed. They won't be packed with us anymore. We dropped over $130 there. Never again."}
{"text":"For the most part, your average \"American food\" type of restaurant. I can't comment on their beers as we didn't have any. The menu was pretty extensive but we'd viewed it online beforehand and knew what we wanted. Hubs got the seafood cobb salad which was HUGE and he enjoyed every last bit of it. I ordered the hazelnut crusted chicken primarily because I noticed before we went that a few reviewers here on yelp recommended it. It was reallllllly good! Also HUGE portions that hubs had to help me eat. the chicken itself was really tender and juicy and that crust and sauce are delicious. The cheddar mashed potatoes were good, as you'd expect, and even the vegetables were yummy. We also had the jalapeno spinach dip which was not that great. I mean it was fine, but out of all the spinach dips I've tried in my life, it was not on the top 10. The atmosphere is nice, it's pleasantly decorated and clean, nothing special. Seems pretty large, probably good for groups. The booth we sat in was really spacious and comfortable. Our service was quick and adequate, although our specific server seemed like she'd rather be anywhere else but work that night. She wasn't rude, just did the bare minimum and spoke very quiet and without any energy. But she was quick and got our orders right, which is really what matters. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but if the location and timing was just right, as it was for us last night, I would go again."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food and the best beer brewed on site! The bourbonzola burger is the best thing you can order here."}
{"text":"The beer is good, but seriously AVOID the guacamole. For 8.99, you get less than you would if you bought a side of guac at chipotle. Also, it was poorly seasoned."}
{"text":"Rock Bottom has been a graduation tradition for my family for the third year in a row this year. I'm not sure what has happened over the course of this time frame but I'm not sure I've ever been so dissatisfied with service somewhere in my life! To start off, we arrived around 9:30 or so, the hostess proceeded to POINT our party of 6 to a dirty table. One of the employees cleaned it off for us and apologized. We sat down, and for 20 minutes we patiently waited on a server to take our drink order. Nothing. Finally, we asked the bartender for drinks as the table of two behind us left in frustration for the same reason. I suppose message was relayed to our server as we finally got someone to come and take our order. She apologized and said their was a mix up with her coworker. She was a sweet girl and I felt bad for her but at the same time we were one of maybe two or three other tables. Needless to say, when our food arrived 45 minutes later it was cold. After our food arrived our waitress told us they were folding silverware in the back and they didn't have any rolled. So we waited again. We didn't leave until after closing (11pm). By the time we finally left the place was still a wreck. It looked like no one had been bussing for hours, the tables around us were disgusting. I can kindly say we will not be returning. Rock Bottom has officially hit rock bottom."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, best margarita pizza ever!! I have to mention our server Tyler, he was amazing, very attentive, always made sure we had everything we needed. I would 100% recommend tyler and rock bottom."}
{"text":"In short, our experience here was awful. Food ranged from bad to pretty good. The service was probably the worst I've had in 20+ years of adult dining experience. 

The positives about Rock Bottom... The restaurant it's self is a really cool space and it's very clean. There are a ton of great beers on tap. The place is very large and we were able to get seated right away on a Friday night. Some of the food was good. 

I dined with a party of six and we ordered a variety of foods... The burgers were just okay. Not particularly flavorful but edible. The onion rings were good. The nacho appetizer was good and the salsa it was served with was very good.  The pretzel sick appetizer was odd... The sticks were not actually pretzels. The didn't look or taste like pretzels, rather like breadsticks. The cheesy jalapeno dip it was served with was good. The firecracker shrimp was very good, definitely the highlight of the meal. The chicken tacos were good. I personally ordered the lobster and shrimp tacos and they were served cold. Not room temperature or lukewarm. They were cold, like they had literally just been pulled from the walk-in.Had they been warm, they probably would have been good. They were served with a side of bland, instant rice and black beans.

The biggest negative about Rock Bottom is by far the service. The service was awful. Although we were seated right away, the server was slow to take our drink order... And slow to return with the drinks... and slow to take our appetizer order... and slow to take our dinner order... And never stopped by to see if everything was okay with our food.  The appetizers came to our table all at once and quickly enough, so there were no issues there.  It then took quite awhile for our dinners to start arriving. Between the six of us, four people had ordered burgers. One burger was brought to the table and then *nothing* else was brought out for 15 minutes... Three more entrees (burgers) were served. And then 5 minutes later, a fifth entree was brought out. And 10 minutes after that (30 minutes after the first entree was brought out) the last entree was delivered (the cold lobster and shrimp tacos). Amidst all of this, I noticed the server did have time to engage in some very public displays of affection (e.g., hugging and kissing) with another server in the middle of the restaurant. Although I did not send the tacos back or complain about them to the server (because who knows how long it would have taken to get a hot order brought out), I noticed on the bill that they had been comped. This tells me that they knew they were serving a bad plate of food and sending out too late. Very odd. 

I definitely will not return to Rock Bottom and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Beers good but the food has shrunk. Had the Ahi Tuna and it was much much smaller then the last time I was Herr. Along with the egg rolls are very disappointingly small portions. Won't be coming back anytime soon except for maybe a beer or two."}
{"text":"Typical sports bar. Caught the tail end of happy hour. I got the Rocktoberfest seasonal ale and that was pretty good. But i ordered a side of fries to munch on and it was incredibly tiny :("}
{"text":"I have been to several Rock Bottoms including Denver, CO and this one was less than impressive. I'm new to Charlotte so I've been waiting to try this Rock Bottom out.  Went on a Sunday afternoon around 5pm. I took my young son with me so it was just dinner no alcohol. The restaurant wasn't very busy so we got seated right away.  Our server (which I didn't get his name) appeared about 5 minutes after we got seated, got our drinks and then we ordered.  We didn't see him again until after our food was brought to us. We only saw him twice after he checked to see if we had our food, and one of those two times was to hand us the check. The food was so-so.  My son had a hamburger which was delicious - my chicken bruschetta was fair but cold and the broccoli had no butter, seasoning, nothing.  It was over priced for what the meal consisted of. I gave two stars because  I was disappointed mainly with the service more so than the food. I've never had bad service or a bad meal at the Rock Bottoms I've been to in the past so was expecting the same high standards that I'm used to.  Might try again, but it will be a while."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Saturday night for a friend's birthday. We had a party of approx. 10 people. We were seated in the back corner and given plenty of space for our party which was nice, considering it was primetime on a Saturday night.

That was pretty much when the good things I have to say about the restaurant end. Our server, from beginning to end, was slow. I would post his name, but I don't know if that's against Yelp rules. I ordered a honey dijon chicken sandwich with french fries. The fries were mediocre at best (not hot, plain tasting) and the sandwich was pretty poor. I don't know how you can screw up grilled chicken, cheese, bacon and honey dijon sauce. The bottom of the bun was completely soggy and the sandwich as a whole was bland. Our guest of honor (the birthday girl) ordered a steak which she had to return because it was almost raw inside. She had asked for medium well. Several members of our group DID, however, like their food.

Going back to the service, several members of our party waited several minutes for drink refills. Also, we had to flag our waiter down for our checks after waiting close to (if not more than) 20 minutes. Even after we gave him our checks and credit cards, he took close to another 10 minutes to bring them back. 

Our best guess is that he knew he was adding an 18% gratuity to our checks because of our party size, so he took his time doing everything. I seriously considered crossing out the 18% and leaving 10% and noting on the tab that the service didn't warrant the 18%, but in the end, I opted against it.

Definitely will not return."}
{"text":"Typical bar-ish type food. Nothing that really stands out. It's a good place to go out after work."}
{"text":"Apps were good, service was average, and the certified angus beef tips were awful.  They were severely overcooked and the sauce they were in had no flavor.  The picture on the menu made it appear you get a good amount of tips.  However, I was given only 4 tips, which in the end I was thankful for, because if I had any more, I would have had to rest my jaw for a couple days due to the extreme toughness and amount of chewing required to swallow those flavorless tips."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour on a Monday. They have $3 beer specials for each day, and food/beverage specials Monday to Friday 3:30-6:30. I tried the Hop Goddess IPA, and for food the nachos and jalapeño pretzels. Service and food were great! Will be back again."}
{"text":"This is the only place that you can get Rock Bottom brewed beer.  They depend on it for their distribution.  Beers are good.  The few I had were on the heavier side.  The food was general southern American.  Battered, greasy and heavy.  They have a 2200 calorie slice of carrot cake on the menu??  2200?  My advice grab some beers, skip he food."}
{"text":"Pretty good, not bad, but nothing I would crave or get excited about so, a solid 3 stars in my book. 

Friendly service and seemed like a good place for huge groups (there's no way any one there could have missed the giant family reunion here where everyone wore the exact same patterned clothing in shirt or dress form!) 

Food was good, pretty good pizza (too thin and floppy for me), jambalaya was pretty good, spicy, and was made with orzo pasta. 

Parking didn't seem like too much of a pain, there was a lot across the street and a garage attached to the building. Overall, it was pretty alright."}
{"text":"We visit this location frequently... 3-4 times a month.  There has always been someone to greet us as we walk in at the Hostess station.  We generally sit in the outside bar area or in the bar during the summer.  The beers are great and I prefer the Red, however the servers ALWAYS tell me what's new on the seasonal beer list and we enjoy different good beer all year long.  Their food is great and the selections are not just the same old thing like soooo many other places.  They offer new seasonal menu items as well and always have something new to try that is  fairly priced.  The servers in the bar area are awesome!  I have never had anything but GREAT service.  They remember what my husband and I like to drink and they are genuinely friendly.  This is one of our families favorite places..."}
{"text":"I will not be returning.

This is place used to have the best beer in town. I got their summer honey ale and it was bitter. Service was slow, spotty, and their classic mac & cheese recipe has been changes. It was a goopy mess that I did not finish.

Everything has changed so much. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing habanero shrimp appetizer, awesome Southwest egg rolls, and the fish tacos were amazing. Next time I am Charlotte I will stop here.

Did I mention the beer was pretty darned good too"}
{"text":"Service wise, this visit sucked! 

Came here around 4pm, we sat on the patio & there were still plenty of empty tables.   Our server came & took our drink order, brought our drinks & then we didn't see him again for almost 15 minutes.  He finally saw us & said he'd be right there....5 minutes later he shows up to take our dinner order.  Hubby got the 2 AM burger & I ordered the chicken fried chicken.  It took 30 minutes for our food to come out which wasn't even brought to us by our server, this other gal just kinda set it down & left. My mashed potatoes were ice cold & hard as a rock, yuck. I could tell the server wasn't coming back so I just ate the chicken. We finished our food & sat & sat until another server saw, took our plates & immediately left so I couldn't even tell her about the potatoes. Finally our original server came & dropped the check off. Luckily, we didn't really have anywhere to be & it was beautiful outside so sitting around wasn't the WORST thing in the world...just kind of a bummer to wait & wait.

I really enjoyed the chicken & the gravy was DEEEELISH! Was def bummed about not getting to enjoy the potatoes since so many people raved about them.  Hubby LOVED his burger so we will probably give this place another shot."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Excellent beer sampler - bargain!  Veggie burger awesome. Onion rings awesome. Fried Mac n cheese was delicious - crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside. Carrot cake was monstrously huge and delicious."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill since the last time I was here. . . 

We showed up on a Saturday around 3:00 PM. The section of the bar that is meant to have ice that you can set your pint on to chill it, was not turned on and was just water. Not a big deal right? However there was old food just sloshing around in the water and the bartender kept placing our drinks in the gross water. 

We got the buffalo shrimp appetizer and the deep fried cuban sandwhich. Both were just ok and nothing spectacular or worth going back for. Not sure what is going on here but this place has tons of potential and should strive a little harder on all fronts. With the competition in this area they shouldn't be slacking at all."}
{"text":"Very disappointing menu. Pseudo Mexican and south of the border fare. I had the Beef Tip Sliders. What a ridicules offering. Each one (2 on a plate) had a nickel sized piece of beef on an oblong  3\" bun. It was taken back to the kitchen, after I complained, and a thin sliver now appeared. The only thing good about this experience, the waiter was nice!
As the raven said, \"Never, never more.\""}
{"text":"Rock Bottom is my go-to place to celebrate life's little accomplishments.  The servings are large and I've never had a bad meal.  It can get a little noisy in there on a Friday night, but I enjoy taking my kids there during the week in the family seating.  Always great beer and really friendly service; looking forward to going again soon!"}
{"text":"Great location in Uptown. Awesome to sit outside and people watch. The menu at any Rock Bottom is semi boring, but if you just want food one step up from Friday's (read: just order a burger and you'll be happy), then this place is good. Fun for after Alive After Five downtown. The bathrooms at this place are pretty cool-- you get to see all the brewery things in the back. Even though it's a large restaurant, I'd try to make a reservation or at least call ahead if you know you are coming-- sometimes the wait here gets just a little north of uncomfortably long."}
{"text":"The food is always good. The pulled pork sandwich is great, as well as many of the appetizers. (Try the pretzels) My only complaint is that the waitstaff/wait times on food has been iffy. Sometimes they're really great and you get food and drinks really quickly and then the other times there seem to be lots of problems, crashing plates in the kitchen, backed up ticket times. I guess it just depends. It's not a bad place to stop off the 101."}
{"text":"Food was good. Only issue with this place was the hour long wait. Place didn't look busy. Was sat down immediately,  10 mins to order food (not bad). The 45 mins waiting for the food come was bad. I had a bacon cheese burger. Patty was suprisingly small compared to the bun. Chipolte mayo was goid. Wife had fish and chips, no complaints other than the fries were burned. Son had the pulled pork. Was tasty but looked unappealing.  Lump of over mixed pork. Cole slaw is just plain bad."}
{"text":"Service was just OK. I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken Salad. It was pretty tasteless...almost like the dressing was watered down. Probably will not go again."}
{"text":"A friend and I had dinner at Rock Bottom on a Saturday evening prior to attending an event at Spirit Square.  The bright red signage makes it easy to spot (we parked at the 7th St garage and it was a short walk).  Surprisingly when we arrived at 5:45, there was already a 30 minute wait (Bobcats game, Panthers game tomorrow, a few other \"events\" in addition to the small venue concert that we were going to were going on).  But true to what the hostess said, exactly 30 minutes later our buzzer buzzed.  

Lovely restaurant, although very dark.  And when walking to the restroom, I though I was being led out into an alley, it's a hike.  Wide selection of menu items, it was hard to decide what to get.  Comfy seating. 

We decided on the Jalapeno Spinach Cheese Dip which is served with tortillas to start with.  It was DELICIOUS.  Creamy and cheesy, the tortilla chips held up to dipping without breaking and they weren't overly salted.  The dip had a little bit of a kick to it without being overwhelming.  Very good start.

I ordered the 2:00 am burger, which is a burger topped with a fried egg, cheese and bacon, with a hashbrown underneath and mac n' cheese as a side (mac n' cheese is an upgrade from the fries side, so you'll be charged a buck for this - it says it clearly on the menu, so no big...).  The burger was meh - not bad by any means, but lacking flavor.  I ended up asking for some ketchup to try and do something to it.  The bun held up well to all of the toppings though, so I didn't even up with a soggy mess on my plate that I would need to eat with a knife and fork, so points for that.  The mac n' cheese was very good.  Nothing fancy, but well done.  

The food was more of a 3.5, but our waitress was amazing, great service even with a packed house, so I will go with a 4.  If another Spirit Square event comes up, I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Classic chain fare - great for lunch & as a place when you can't get into anywhere else.  Service at this location was great."}
{"text":"didnt eat.. the pilsner was hopped to perfection along the lines of an ipa- brilliant"}
{"text":"So after an evening of enjoying a comedy show at the Waterfront, we headed to Rock Bottom for some late night grub.  The place was pretty busy, we had to walk around the bar area for several minutes until a nice couple told us they were about to leave and we could have their bar table.  As nice as this was of them it was awkward standing over them as they finished their drinks paid their bill and left.  

So finally seated I look over the drinks and being the huge IPA lover that I am I went with that and it was indeed a good choice.  The hubby had the Red Ale which was also rather good.

The service was OK, not the best not the worst.  But moving on to more important thing, the food.  Talk about missing the mark hugely!  I ordered the mini street fish tacos.  You get four mini tacos with a marinated in lime piece of fish, and tomatillo salsa.  They were just strokes away from inedible.  I love fish tacos, I mean it is such a simple concept so why do people have such a hard time executing this dish? The shells were hard and literally split at the bottom when I picked them up.  The sour cream sprayed all over the plate only made them messy and the poor fish was just so overcooked.  If I wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have eaten them at all! Lesson learn on that.

The husband had the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  It had beans and corn with roasted red pepper on it along with some sour cream.  My husband is usually the type that will order these lovely specialty pizza's and ask for them to remove all the wonderful unique toppings!  For instance, he would usually just say, Chicken BBQ and cheese, nothing else!  I refused to let him do that this time, because I was really intrigued in the combination of ingredients on this pie.  And boy was I jealous when it came out.  It blew my crappy tacos out of the water!  Should have stuck with something simple.  

Furthermore I could care less if I come back to this location.  The beers were good but hell you can get a decent IPA just about anywhere anymore.  And the underwhelming food sealed the deal.  I know this is a chain, but it still doesn't have to stink..."}
{"text":"I go to Rock Bottom pretty often for dinner or their awesome beer, so I was really really excited to have my bridal shower there.  My maid of honor reserved the banquet room which was very nice and separated from the rest of the restaurant.  My MOH and mother said that the person they talked to about reservations and arrangements was wonderful and easy to get in touch with.  My shower was wonderful, the wait staff was great and kept everyone's glasses full.  It started pouring down rain and they let us stay a little longer so my gifts wouldn't get wet when taking them out to the car.  The only reason this place gets 4 stars is because we were not allowed to take our leftover food from the buffet home.  There was salmon, chicken, potatoes, and mac and cheese left over and they told us we couldn't box it up.  Not sure why- they can't re-serve it!  It would have just gone to waste!

Also, not at all related to the shower, their trivia night is super fun!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Rock Bottom in years.  Maybe even decades...is that even possible?  Well, either way, it's been awhile.  So with my gift certificate I took my brother out for a birthday dinner.  

As I get older, my tolerance for things like crowds and youngsters gets lower and lower.  As a result, I told my brother to be ready by 4pm so we could head to the Waterfront before everyone goes out for date night.  Plus the Pirates were playing at 4:05 so we could enjoy our beers and the game.

When we arrived, the bar side was already pretty packed but we were still able to get a table.  Our server was very attentive, friendly and helpful.  Right off the bat we both ordered samplers so we could try all of their beers.  We loved the fact that as she approached our table with a full tray of samples our server said, \"I have to go back for the rest.\"  In all we were served 10 different beers each (in 3 oz glasses, maybe 4 - I can never tell).  I gotta say, Rock Bottom knows their beer.  I liked more than I didn't, and very few were not to my liking.  So the $6.95 10 beer sampler was well worth it.  

During our sampling we indulged on some Southwest Egg Rolls.  They were okay, but not quite what I expected.  The spicy ranch was top notch, though.  As we ran out of beer, we each ordered up a Kobe Burger.  They were both cooked exactly to our liking (medium).  And to top off our wonderful evening, the Pirates brought home a win!

My only complaint, as a beer drinker, is the cost for a growler.  The glass container itself is sold for $12.95.  That's the empty price.  To me, that's a little ridiculous when East End only charges $3 for the bottle and Penn Brewery $5.  Paying more for the bottle than the beer inside seems like insanity to me.  So I walked out empty handed.    But it won't deter me from returning."}
{"text":"Went here for a pre-show meal. We were looking forward to the beers, and fortunately or unfortunately (depending upon your viewpoint), that was the highlight of the meal. I ordered the ribs, which were dry and not that hot. Also they were not that tender. Their sweet sauce, however, was good, but no sauce can make up for poorly cooked ribs. My wife had the chicken pesto pasta. While that was decent, it wasn't exciting either.

Sure, the plates were \"sizeable.\" But PRICEY for what you get. I mean, we could have gone to Aria Italian nearby and gotten a MUCH better quality of food for LESS than this place! I mean, we went here thinking we would get a good value. Unfortunately, it's more than a lot of other comparable places in Uptown.

Too many other choices in Charlotte to come back here."}
{"text":"Rock Bottom is a nice hangout place. Often when you are out and about with friends you arrive home with no voice from screaming over all of the background noise. Great if your out to see a band, but not so much fun if you actually want to talk to the people sitting around you. 


Depending on your mood you can sit in the dining area full of booths and tables. It's alittle separated from the main bar area so provides for a semi quiet dining area. The bar area gives you a choice of sitting at the surrounding tables with waitress service or hanging out at the bar itself. Complete with a chillie ice strip to keep those yummy brews cold and the ever entertaining company of your favorite bartender. When the weather cooperates the outdoor patio houses about 6 tables for outdoor dining. The view however...not so picturesque, just the entrance to the Improv. Which hey, that could be the perfect seat if you're stocking the local comics! 


The bar area contains pools tables and dart boards to try your skills. On any give night sports fans can enjoy the games of the day on one of the 6 big screen TVs surrounding the bar area. 

The menu is pretty decent with burgers that are cooked to order with the choice of either steak , veggie or chicken. They have a number of specialty burgers with different cheeses, toppings and creative themes. The bourbonzolla is a tasty burger with a Bourbon based glaze and Gorgonzola cheese. Appetizers which range from nachos to firecracker shrimp. Steaks, pasta and salads with rotating specials from different areas of the menu. 

On Monday the burgers are half off...I don't think you have to be a member of their mug club to get the special. However, if you are here regularly the mug club is great with free gifts and specials.

Needless to say I have a fun beer glass collection thanks to Rock Bottom...LOL! 

Now everyone favorite part about Rock Bottom's Beers! 
The in house brew master keeps it interesting with a rotating variety of frothy yummy to try along with the consistant favorites of Ale, IPA's, Rotating Darks and Kolsch.

{"text":"It's as impersonal as any other chain restaurant. The food has no flair or creativity. And depending on what you order can be really great or really disgusting. Caution: items arrive not as described on the menu!

Maybe if I liked beer I might enjoy it a little more.

The mac and cheese is okay.

Had a special spicy pasta dish they were featuring. That was the best thing I've tried.

The pretzels are amazing.

{"text":"The live music was the best thing about the place. We made reservations but they screwed it up so about 15 of us had to huddle in a corner, and it took 30 minutes to get our drinks. Service was slow and really bad so it made for a poor experience. If it wasn't for the guy with the guitar and harmonica, I might have strangled the server. Don't think I'll visit again anytime soon."}
{"text":"There are so many other places with great beer and food. I suppose Rock Bottom might do in a pinch. 

We didn't get served right away, I guess we fell through the cracks. But by the time someone got to us, they explained the happy hour specials were only good until 6:30 pm. That stung, because if we had been served when we arrived, we would have qualifed.   They missed one great opportunity to make things right, but they blew it. 

We decided on the Guacamole Made-To-Order. It wasn't made table side, and it wasn't all that good, just rather disappointing. The pizza, was pretty tasty, especially the crust. 

I ordered the Oatmeal Stout, but it was only so-so. At least the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"This is a completely fine place to eat/drink. The drinks are pretty good, and the food is ok. As far as chains go, it isn't bad. However, I live within walking distance from one of these and go maybe once a year, which I think speaks volumes."}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant to eat at in all of Charlotte! I refuse to try anything other than their fish tacos! Everyone that I have visited the restaurant with raves about their burgers but the fish tacos are by far the best I have ever had! The beer that is brewed within the restaurant/brewery is also delicious and I make sure to get the beer sampler every time I go so that I do not have to pick just one. The atmosphere is also a huge highlight. Part of the restaurant is a laid back, sports bar type of restaurant while the other half has a swanky feel to it. You can definitely go in jeans and a t-shirt or dressed up for a night on the town and be comfortable. The bathrooms are always cleaned and are regularly checked and the service has never been poor. Sometimes, I consider driving the 2 hours just to go! Make sure to check out this place next time you are in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Eh
Interesting menu, but I found the food to be rather mediocre
Even compared to the Rock Bottom at Desert Ridge

I do enjoy their happy hour beer though, so 2 stars for a good microbrew!"}
{"text":"Ergh, this place. I hate giving bad reviews but on my latest visit, I should have listened to my gut and not repeated my visit here. Naturally, I'm not a stranger to this chain, understand it's a chain, but the past visit here was just not good.

Came with my brother on a Sunday after a driving lesson. We were hungry and this was his way of paying for gas money. We were seated in the dining area. Every time we are seated in the dining area it's a bad experience. On the bar side you get entertainment, the beer flights/draft specials are decent and the bar food/appetizers are passable.

It started off with the soft drinks. I'm not a pop drinkers so when I want a simple diet pepsi I expect it not to taste funky [and yes, I prefer the weird twang of diet drinks to sugar in a glass taste of regular]. There was incorrect carbonation, whether they were running out [I suspect this], no ice [lukewarm] or they had just hooked up a new box [unlikely]. I sent it back.

My brother got a burger which he said was fine, it came with an egg on it and he found himself satisfied. I tried to steal a few of his fries, which were a failure. They tasted like the off brand in the freezer section [a full mouth of starch], and were barely crispy enough. So abandon plan. On my own dish I had the classic mac n' chicken. First of all, the pasta was crispy?, really?, it wasn't a cheese sauce, it was pretty much butter baked on and sprinkled in Parmesan and smothered in breadcrumbs. And when I say smothered here, this is not a good thing. Sigh. The chicken was pushed to the bottom of the pan, which my brother tasted because I was turned off my this version of my favorite dish, and said it was cooked properly. A small save? 

Again - I sent it back after about 3 bites. The waitress came back asking if I wanted a box, I told her to take it away. She did and disappeared into oblivion until we had to flag her down for the check, which I didn't see as my brother paid for it while I used the restroom, I hope they didn't charge us for the pop drink.... Needless to say, I came home hungry. 

Honestly, if you come, come for drinks and a salad, they don't screw those up. Everything else, avoid."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Memorial Day. They have an outside seating area that is covered which was a huge plus and it is located really close to 7th Street Market. 
I tried a flight of their beers and they were decent but nothing special. I would recommend the red ale or the double IPA. 
We had their nachos to start which were ok, it is a huge serving that comes with salsa to dip. I had the veggie tacos which were good, they had a crunchy shell covered with a soft tortilla which I actually enjoyed. It came with a side of rice and beans. I really liked the black beans but there was something about the rice that had a bad after taste. 
My husband ordered the veggie burger and fries. I tried the fries and I liked them but didn't try his burger. He said it was good but again nothing special."}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE the food here. However we had family in town and brought them here and the service was terrible. It's embarrassing the service was so bad after we have been talking this establishment up for so long. The food took forever but was delicious once we received it. The server was Ami and had zero desire to be there and really wasn't in the mood for our party of eight."}
{"text":"We have been going to Rock Bottom for sevesrl years and Love it! It is our go to place, when we want a nice meal, in a nice atmosphere,  with good service! We have had 1 maybe 2 not so great visits but for the most part, service is EXCELLENT and the food is consistent!  After leaving another restaurant (just trying to do something new for a celebration) because of poor service, we were greeted and seated in a few seconds!  Our server was at our table within seconds even though she had a large (10 to 12 guests) Group at the table near us. We had our drinks in minutes and were checked on twice within 5 minutes. Our food came out rather quickly and was delicious! Our server was very attentive and social. As usual, a save by our go to place! I know we will retun here again!"}
{"text":"Amazing food wonderful spread of locally crafted beers! Kid friendly great for a date and I would suggest the beer flight with the margarita pizza!"}
{"text":"Great beer, food and service! Best sports bar type place in Desert Ridge. Love their happy hour and mug club! Great place to meet friends and watch a game :) Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of chain restaurants typically and had to slowly break my boyfriend from wanting to eat at chain restaurants all of the time. The one chain that I can't break from is rock bottom. 

Their beer is always good- as far as their staples go, I really love their white ale. Their seasonal IPAs have been good and my favorite seasonals of all time included their chocolate raspberry stout (...yes, it tasted as good as it sounds; they had it last year around Christmas) and their smoky BBQ brown ale (tasted like summer, complemented BBQ amazingly ; they had it this past summer, I bought a growler of it lol). 

As far as their food goes, I typically stay away from the appetizers. $10 and up is a little too pricey for me as far as appetizers go. I've had their southwestern rolls and they were good but not worth $10. 

Almost every time I go I order the Baja chicken sandwich. It's my favorite chicken sandwich! So good. The chicken is actually grilled (which goes for all of their chicken sandwiches) and I love the charred flavor that it has. The bun is soft but sturdy and doesn't fall apart while eating the sandwich, the sauce is amazing, the onion frizzles are the best and last but not least... There's a half of a fresh avocado on this sandwich. Mhm! I love it. My boyfriend usually gets the hickory BBQ bacon chicken sandwich and loves it as well. 

Another item I ALWAYS get... Their apple coleslaw. I've yet to find better coleslaw in a restaurant. So simple, yet oh so good. 

They also recently changed their fries and these are much better than their old ones. 

Their side salads are awesome as well. They are decent in size- spring mix topped with sunflower seeds, raisins, half of a hard boiled egg (which I give to the boyfriend), chopped cucumbers and tomatoes and croutons. Yum! 

I usually order the same thing every time I go. I steered off my normal path once and ordered the buffalo Mac and cheese and found it to be quite tasteless. Which turned me off to trying new items there. Plus I am just too in love with the Baja chicken sandwich and apple coleslaw to want to try anything else. 

Service is always great, the bartenders are friendly... I love this place. Ask about their rock bottom rewards !"}
{"text":"If your in the market for a beer or two this could be an option. They have a nice seasonal selection and it's all tap which I prefer. I also like that most of the seating is booth. On my visit the service was lack luster. I have no idea where the waitress went for half the meal and her listening skills left much to be desired. I went with a beer sampler. It was nice being able to try everything they have. I of course went with the pumpkin beer. For my main dish I had stuffed peppers which I honestly enjoyed. They had a great flavor. My only issue is the rice that came with it was a bit under cooked. If service was better and my rice was cooked I would have given this place a solid 4 stars but that unfortunately wasn't the case on this particular visit."}
{"text":"I visited Charlotte and decided to go here, cause it was crowded. The wait was 35-50 minutes. I really didn't know what to choose --- so i end up ordering Beer Battered Fish and Chips (os os) and the ribs and chicken combo w/ fries (os os). There was nothing really special about the food. Charlotte doesn't have much to offer when it comes to food =P"}
{"text":"For far to long I put this place at the rock bottom of my brewery list in town, it seems that I was mistaken.

Many years had passed since my last visit here, and after an invite from some friends and a good tasting at the last yelp event I went in.

We sat on the large patio to enjoy the great spring AZ weather, it also enable us to accommodated upwards for 20 people at our conjoined table.

Happy hour was in full effect $3.25 beers (in a mug) and $5 pizza's and appetizers.

I started off with a stout, it was nice full bodied not to bitter and with a rich head. I learned that each beer is made on site with their own local recipes

For food I went with the margarita pizza ($5 on HH $10 normal).  TO my surprised it was cooked in a open flame oven and it was almost a Bianco style pizza, it had fresh motzrella , basil, tomatoes and pesto on it. It was pretty good but a bit low on the crust to topping ratio. 

Service was decent for a large patio party too.

Happy hr is  3:30pm - 6:30pm & 9-Close all days, give it a try"}
{"text":"I must admit, I've only ever been to Rock Bottom with a coupon, but it's the reason why I keep coming back. If you sign up for their rewards club you get an email with a coupon (usually a buy 1 get 1 free entree coupon) maybe every other month. They also run food/drink specials so be on the look out for that (this past summer they did 2 burgers/sides/2beers for $17. Can't beat that!).

I've tried a variety of different food options here and everything has always been pretty decent. The nachos are HUGE and a great starter if you come with a group. The tacos and shrimp/lobster enchiladas are my husband's and I's go to picks. However I recently got the bourbon salmon and it was delicious! We always get a side of mac-n-cheese. It's pretty darn good here. Overall the food is OK and a little above par from your typical sports bar.

The only down side-  I don't really care for their beers, but they have others available as draft or bottles. In addition, their service can be hit or miss. We never come here with high expectations, but it's within walking distance from our house and if we have a coupon it's worth it."}
{"text":"Disappointed, and actually a little sad...

Perhaps it's the change in general manager (or maybe I'm subconsciously biased because the old GM shared name with a friend).

Haven't been to this location in a while, but it had always been solid (good food, great service, awesome beers).  The good news is the beers are still awesome.  Had the Winter Wheat - served with a slice of orange and a sprinkle of nutmeg.  Mmmm...

Foodwise, the new, slimmer menu was a bit sad for me.  No more salmon fish & chips and no more meatloaf.  My two Rock Bottom favorites.  Ordered Mac & Chicken and Mac+Chicken+Chorizo.  A side of fries for my picky 2-year old and the badass ballpark pretzels to start.  Now, admittedly, this is bar food and has always been on the salty side, but they've gone a step further.  Now, I do like to binge on hugely salty food once in a while, so I won't say I didn't love it, but I can literally feel it now... Blood pressure meds, here I come...

The big bummer was the service.  It started out with the hostesses.  Friendly enough, but it was a bit off-putting to be asked twice if we needed a high-chair (and respond twice that no, just a booster would be great) and then end up with no booster.  Walked back up to the front and asked again, no problem.  OK, so far.  So, then, we sit down... and we wait.  No problem, must be busy... Friday night, holiday season at a big shopping spot... but wait, those are empty tables... 6 of 'em in our section the whole time (maybe shoulda taken that as a sign).  

Anyway, after about 5 minutes, our server comes.  She's friendly/pleasant.  We order our drinks and the pretzels.  Drinks come just fine.  Another few minutes later, she returns to take our order.  No problems, but 2 place settings.  3 people.  Hostess doesn't notice.  Waitress doesn't notice.  Then, I see what appears to be a manager stealing settings from one table and putting on another... so, I follow suit and steal one myself.  Problem solved.

About 60 seconds later, our lukewarm fries arrive.  Whatever.  Just for the kid.  Appreciate the speed.  That's followed a minute later by my wife's side salad.  About 10 minutes later the pretzels show up, followed by our entries 45 seconds later.  Nice timing.  Then, the kid starts griping about no ketchup.  Hmmm... that's odd... Fries, but no ketchup and no ask from the server.  Whatever. So another couple minutes goes by, and we see our server flying by and flag her down.  Ketchup for all.

During this time, I overhear the table behind me working through a problem with their bill (charged for 3 beers they never ordered or drank).

If this were a Denny's, I'd be more than pleased with the service.  But, maybe I'm getting picky/cheap in my old age, but it feels like it's kinda shoddy for a $25/head meal.  

Our waitress was pleasant and earnest, but clearly undertrained.  The several tables left unbussed around us for the duration of our meal was also a clear indicator.  The three hostesses on duty unable to effectively service a light crowd was another sign.  This place clearly has systemic management issues.  

Won't be coming back to this location (though I'll keep an eye on the GM sign in the window and try it again when it changes again).  We'll drive the extra few miles to Shea/101 location next time we want Rock Bottom."}
{"text":"Rock Bottom probably has one of the best locations in uptown. Right on Tryon St. with a large dining area and excellent patio for people watching or watching the cars go by.

I don't remember what I ordered I think it was some sort of BBQ chicken and ribs. The food was pretty average, I didn't get to try the beer but I hear it's quite excellent. It's not that the food is bad, in fact I quite enjoyed my time here, but the selections available and food that came out were just not quite memorable. Maybe I would even call it boring.

I'd come just for the great atmosphere here. When you go to the bathroom you can see all the behind the scenes brewing behind a large glass window! The parking is free too which is nice, more to spend on food!"}
{"text":"Great food, great wait staff. I asked waitress for hot sauce and mentioned I like habanero sauce and she said she could bring me diced habaneros. That was super. I love habaneros and the diced habanero went great with the fabulous Jambalaya. My wife had the enchiladas and I tasted them and they were great. Great beer. Will definitely return to this place."}
{"text":"We just came from dinner at Rock Bottom. We sat in the bar area instead of the dining room this time because my husband wanted to the basketball game. Maybe this was our mistake. Our waitress was awful! We waited an unusually long time before she even got to our table to order our drinks. Because they are a microbrewery the beers change and we couldn't remember the one we liked so we asked to share a sample of two. This is something they do all the time. She seemed impatient and when she brought the sample she just slapped it on the table without telling us which was which! When I ordered the one I liked I asked for an orange slice because it was a wheat beer. Also extra napkins. Well it arrived, no orange and no napkins. It was though she really didn't care what we wanted! When we reminded her she abruptly walked away the slapped a dish with an orange slice but again no napkins. When my husband mentioned it again she very rudely said \"I am very busy!\" No apologies, just rudeness. I guess we didn't matter as much as her other guests. Most people in the bar area just order appetizers and drinks but we were ordering dinner and drinks. Being busy is a good thing for a business and if you can't handle it you should maybe think of something else you can do that you might be better at. Having said this, the times we have sat in the dining area we have always had decent service. But this really made us angry and I do not think we will be going back."}
{"text":"Since I moved to Charlotte I would drive and walk by this establishment. Finally got to go there this past Sunday. Our party consisted of 11 people. They put 3 tables together to accommodate our group. The shaft of the table was so loose I was afraid to put my drink on it. So I put it on the stable table that my wife was in front of. Food was good.(hadn't eaten all day, so anything I ate at 7pm would be good). I do like that they validate parking in the lot.

Sadly the highlight of the night was our waiter. It was noticeable and very easy to observe, that either he was having a bad day or he didn't want to be there. EVERYONE in our party kept commenting on that. He was asked if he had any recommendations of what to order, and he informed us of the signature dishes that had the fork and knife next to it. That wasn't the question! It felt like we were inconveniencing him when we needed a refill on our drinks. Interestingly he warmed up slightly at the end. I guess because we were leaving and it would be \"tip time.\"

I like the variety of the items on the menu, and would love to explore the other options because my food was good. I'm very hesitant to return because of the service. Highly disappointed that no attempt was made to correct the wobbling table. I can eat food at home on my sturdy table, I don't feel satisfied as a consumer paying to eat at an establishment where the table is in that condition."}
{"text":"This place is just okay. It's priced appropriately. Feels kinda like a chain quality of food (think olive garden or applebees). I probably won't return, as I like more flavorful food and better beers."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers especially the seasonal ones! You won't be disappointed. The Jalapeño pretzels are dope!"}
{"text":"Hmmmm, well the food was okay. the service was okay. the atmosphere was just okay. 

That sums it up."}
{"text":"I had the beer sampler here. For $6 I got to taste 6 pretty good beers.  We had the jambalaya and it was decent. TBH, I have no clue what great jambalaya is...

service was pretty good."}
{"text":"My husband and I were fans of the Denver Rock Bottom when we lived in Colorado, so we decided to have a date night at the Pittsburgh location a few weeks ago.

They were very crowded, but we got a reservation on OpenTable and were able to skip the line.  We arrived a few minutes early, but they were able to seat us when we got there.  

The beer is consistently good here--  I went with the fire chief red ale, and my husband tried both one of the cask strength beers and an IPA.  I ordered the bacon chicken mac n' cheese, and it was as good as I remembered.  My husband's steak was overdone, but the servers were very apologetic (they offered to replace it, and ended up comping it) and he said it was seasoned well.  For dessert, we split the mason jar bourbon pecan pie, and it was delicious, with a really delicious ice cream on top.

This location may not have quite lived up to our expectations from the original, but I'd be happy to end up here again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"One of my families favs (Husband Primarily). This place has an ok selection of brew, only house brew on draft. A bit too snobby to highlight anyone elses. What surprises me here is the food selestion. It has the requisite 'Pub\" foods, including a tower of onion rings. Get past that and you will discover a great variety from comfort food favorites to fresh and funky. Last night I had the hazelnut chicken, 3 stars, my husband had the ahi salad; 5 stars!! The waiter insisted we try thier current special; Banana Cream Pie, its on thier holiday menu. I agreed reluctantly,abnd it was good. another funky dish. the only thing I would suggest is to ditch the canned whip and replace with fresh whip. Not hard to do. 

Wait staff here can be unpredictable, sometines on, sometimes off...

I like this spot because of teh mix of old time bar feel you can get with Pubs and the great dining area with comfortable seating, subdued lighting and great acoustic so you can hear your dinner companion."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner with some friends on Halloween night.  The place was pretty empty, but that's probably because of Halloween.  I go there for one dish --the Mac & Chicken.  It was terrific as usual.  My wife and my friends had salmon and fish & chips and their dinners were good.  The server was friendly and attentive...some of the other servers were dressed for Halloween.  Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"We came with a group of 10...the service was friendly but very slow. Our food came out very staggered, about a 15 minute process. We had to ask for all the basic things, silverware, refills, condiments, ext. we had an event we were going to and had to cut out dessert because it was so slow. We allotted 2 hours for dinner and still had to leave the table to find our server for our check. Several times food runners came by our table with large trays that came inches away from our heads( we were at a high top table) and did not say anything...someone from our party would have to yell, \" don't move\". It had been years since we have been and may be years again..."}
{"text":"My order:  shrimp & chicken, extra spicy.  I didn't, no, couldn't eat any of it.  Way too spicy.  Oh well, I was full from the sampler anyway.

His order:  fire steak.  Tasted great, but no 'fire' - mashed potatoes were awesome too.

Appetizer:  sampler.  $17 but well worth it - you probably can share an entree if you get this appetizer.  It's delicious!  The pretzel combo was so unique!

I don't know if we'd go back here (if we lived in AZ, or even try visiting the one in LB, CA), but glad we tried it out.  Wish we could've tried the brew.  Service was alright, but could definitely have been better."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! Our waitress was extremely rude when out menu did not match the iPad description of the food my mom was ordering. Got in my father face and yelled at him. When the tacos came, there was no avocado (making it the healthy option). Will not be back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave it a star at all is because the beer was good - the server was nice but super slow and the hostess was totally lost.  Whatever you do - do NOT order the burgers - we left it as we thought it would make us sick - there was nothing but blood and a wet bun - fries were like frozen steak fries and the steak sliders was crumbles (and I mean a few crumbles) though the crumbles what I had were ok.  I don't know if it's the location or what because I remember Rock Bottom being great at Desert Ridge.  Unless you want only beer, let the next visitor be the HEALTH DEPARTMENT --- pass!"}
{"text":"This review is for the happy hour. I love the patio, although sometimes the smokers are a bit much. The service is usually very good and the hostesses always are accomodating by trying to seat you where you like to sit.

I enjoy the Brewery Nachos which are served with melted cheddar and pepper jack cheese along with beans, tomatoes, jalapenos and onions. I tasted my wife's fried calamari last night and really liked it. They serve it with marinara sauce and a spicy Thai Chili sauce. The Ball Park Pretzels (two pretzels) are huge and served with jalapeno cheese dip. I find that this app has way too much garlic on the pretzel. The three Kobe Sliders, which are served with fried onion strings is excellent.

The dish that rocks my world is the Roasted Vegetable Pizza. During Happy Hour the pizza is $7. It has roasted zucchini, roma tomatoes, red peppers, mozzarella and feta cheese with sun dried tomato pesto, spinach and

WAIT FOR IT...............Vinaigrette dressing which is a perfect topping to this pizza. I normally used to get the yummy BBQ Chicken Pizza but have switched allegiance to the Roasted Vegetable pizza.

This happy hour is so reasonably priced that my brother-in-law actually took out his wallet last night and picked up the tab."}
{"text":"I love the Rock Bottom Restaurant but I am not too crazy about the Rock Bottom Brewery. The reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because the beer is not the greatest in my opinion. 

The burgers are good but my favorite is the Sonoma Chicken Wrap. Which is a wrap cut in two with Chicken, bacon, gucamole and spinach as the main ingredients. This wrap hits the spot, I think the Guac really makes this dish.

The Rock has $5 happy hour specials on the appetizers. The nachos are good but would be excellent if Guac was served with them instead of paying extra for 2 small dollups of Guac. The firecracker shrimp is excellent as well. But the most amazing app is the Titan Toothpick which is like 4 footlong very skinny chicken burritos serve with Guac. This one app alone can fill up most anyone.

And of course, I love their patio. Which is big and compy with plenty of misters for the warmer part of the year."}
{"text":"Ok another one with as many check-ins I have for this place that should be my review. If this was Boston than Rock Bottom would be my Cheers. What can I say about this place. Lets start with drinks.

The beer is made in house. I love the beer the current brew master has been doing a great job. I look forward to tapping part of the new brews he has made. The Bartends are freaking awesome and very cute(always a plus at a bar). They are super friendly and makes the best drinks in the world.  

Food is awesome. I love the apps and whatever season menu item they come up with. This summer they had a luau with a pig roast. I was great. My favorite item off the menu is the steak cooked texas fire style. Trust me when you smell it you will want it. The salad are really great especially if you are on a diet. 

So to sum it up great drinks, great food, awesome and cute staff. Why are you not there now?"}
{"text":"We really enjoy it here.  We like to sit in the bar area. My husband likes the IPA and I enjoy a pineapple mojito or a glass of wine.  Food is good, especially the guacamole and the carne asada street tacos.  Servers are great, always friendly, especially Chris, he keeps us very amused.  We will miss the Rock Bottom when we head back north."}
{"text":"I happened upon this place on Sunday night and I've been back every night I've been in town this week. This says a lot, as I love variety and spontaneity. The staff is awesome! The food is great! And the beer (brewed on site) is great. I love the Texas Fire Ribeye! I am not into spicy food, but the staff assured me it's not that bad. The spice adds flavor but isn't overwhelming to the palate. I will definitely be back next time I'm in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing! Really wanted a bloody Mary, it was a little weak for my liking. I had to spice it up myself, maybe I'll just ask for it to be spicy next time. The cheddar-bacon burger was delicious and the Mac n cheese was incredible! Boyfriend had the 2am and fries and after the bloody, a beer - he was satisfied. Oh - definitely order a side of ranch. You will love it!"}
{"text":"Rock bottom ...name explains itself. My friends got quesadillas...it simply wasn't a quesadilla it was a fuckin taco. No cheese...just don't get it. Service sucked our waiter was eh idk we didn't get water until after we finished our meal. My food was fantastic tho highly recommend the enchilada"}
{"text":"I love this place. Located right in the little city I grew up in.. along with the awesome craft beer comes some of the BEST food you can imagine. The reverse happy hour food is unbeatable. But! bring back the macaroni &cheese bites! Oh yeah, the bartender Ryan is the coolest!"}
{"text":"We came for dinner on a Saturday evening and sat at the bar. The beer was good, service was ok, but the food was terrible. I ordered lobster & shrimp \"enchiladas\", which had practically no filling. It was just a rolled tortilla with a few shrimp and pieces of lobster meat on top. The two people I was with both got burgers, one was charred to the point it was inedible (requested medium well) the other was also over cooked and came with giant chunks of onion even though he ordered it with no onions. Our server tried to take care of us by comping some of the meal so that was good but still would not recommend going here for food."}
{"text":"Awesome place to hangout. We love it. The decor is inviting and service is good too. Nice collection of beers. My favorite is wheat beer because it's been my favorite since I first tried it in Germany the Wiesen Beer. I just love it. Food is good too!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times & always find it disappointing. Tried a variety of foods & none have been particularly good."}
{"text":"I have sat at the bar, house red ale, jambalaya, big chunks of chicken, shrimp, and sausage, great spicy. I have had the pulled pork with the white ale. I have had the fish tacos. I have been back over and over and over. I have a colleague who eats here 3 or 4 times a week. This place is winner winner chicken dinner."}
{"text":"The experience was different the second time around. We asked for a booth and got one right away. When we sat down, the waitress came fast and serve our drinks and appetizers fast. The food was great until the steak and shrimp came with the broccoli. It was not good, the broccoli was burnt bad and I ask medium well and they sent it bloody. My boyfriend's bison burger was not that tasty either he sent it back. They sent the burnt broccoli back and I got a great salad, the steak had to go all the way to well done, but I believe the grill is not being clean properly cause the steak tasted burnt and charred. So the manager came over and ask my boyfriend if he wanted something else, he didn't and he asked me how he could make it better, I asked that next time could we have are food done properly cooked. He apologized and actually looked out with discounting the meal and gave us fresh spinach dip, which I enjoyed. I will not return but the customer service was awesome and I won't say don't go, but know what to order and what to watch out for when ordering!"}
{"text":"Your typical chain \"Fridays style\" restaurant. The cool thing that this place has going for it though is that they make their own beer. They have a list of standards that they have all the time as well as some seasonal stuff. If your around in the waterfront and want to have some beers then this might be a good place to pick, I would not however make a special trip just for this place."}
{"text":"This was my first time in years here and honestly I must say overall I'm impressed. We ordered the flights and let the bartender pick our choices. They were all very different and delicious in different ways! The Porter is an interesting one!! The firecracker shrimp is AMAZING. The only hiccups through our service was the fries were over cooked (the server was more than happy to get us fresh ones) and he didn't like to refill our waters lol. Definitely a great place for food!!!"}
{"text":"Their beers are really good, I just wish the food was that great too. I ordered the bacon chicken mac and cheese, which instantly got my mouth watering just thinking about it. I ate a little bit, but I didn't want to finish it. Way too much pepper or spices, and I could hardly taste the cheese. It would be better if they didn't label it as a mac and cheese, because it didn't taste like that at all to me. It came with a slice of french bread on the side, but it was plain. No butter on it or any on the side. Kinda weird.

My sister raved about her hazelnut crusted chicken, but I wasn't too impressed by that either. I ended up just drinking my dinner, which is just fine by me! :)"}
{"text":"Get to the Chase:

Pros:
1) Fantastic ribs! Succulent, juicy, and came right off the bone
2) Exceptional service (I think I saw our waitress spend half the time on her hands and knees wiping off crumbs and food that other customers left under their table)...I have never seen a restaurant where that happened...not only that she was always genuinely smiling and making sure we had fresh water
3) Fantastic beer selections (would highly recommend the beer sampler)
4) First time I actually LOVED coleslaw...perfect balance of slaw, mayo, and tangy sweetness (accented by the freshly cut slivers of apple)
5) Desserts do equal justice to their delicious entrees

Cons:
1) None"}
{"text":"This place has a decent menu, it's executed pretty well, and they (of course) make their own beers. Too bad it's often packed to the rafters with \"former frat boy turned middling banking executives who still listen to DMB on the side\". I'm happy to eat there if I happen to be uptown and the crowd wants to... but I try to avoid it whenever I can."}
{"text":"In this spot, I ingested the world dullest Cobb salad and a watered down Arnold Palmer. My accompanying bread roll was hard enough to break a tooth, so I could not partake.

At least the prices were not outrageous."}
{"text":"So if you know me you know I love beer! I really wish I was one of those people that hated beer sometimes but Dear God I love beer!! I think its in my genetic code to love beer from both sides of my family. I'll admit if it wasnt for the beer I'd probably never come here but kids eat free on Mon & Tues. that means what??? You guessed it more BEER for ME!!! I did the beer sampler and fyi the tea here is a ripoff just drink beer. BEER ONLY!!! Got it???!?! 

I had the NEW Mahi Tacos: Chile grilled they are wrapped in soft white corn tortillas with homemade pineapple slaw and fresh cilantro. Served with black beans, ancho chile rice and fresh pico de gallo.  -- My only gripe was the corn tortillas they tasted like paper but the rest was pretty delicous I was upset I couldn't eat all three tacos. You could easily share this plate between two gal pals! 

Kid made her own pizza and what kid doesn't like making pizza?!?!?! Nuff said...

Oh yes did I mention I like the beer here!?!?!"}
{"text":"I am not a beer drinker. As a former Restaurant Manager, of a restaurant in Pittsburgh that used to brew its own beer, I did once help the Brew Master make an ale, as part of the training. Craft beer is an inquired taste. I can drink it on occasion under the right circumstance.
 
Rock Bottom has never been our go-to craft beer place. I like going to Rock Bottom after the movies, because it is the only place open late, other than Eat-n-Park, which I do not like. 

I love the Mac-Cheese with Bacon & Chicken. It is the dish I order every time. I am not much on the spices that they cook with for the other dishes. The rest of my family loves the spices dishes. The Mac-Cheese is a dish that I  highly recommend. 

My  three stars is because of the service. The one thing I really dislike about this place,  is at night dinning, the side work and the cleaning the servers do when people are eating really bothers me. The service gets so slow because, the servers are doing their side work to complete their shift. I really dislike having the sweeper run under my feet or around the table when I am eating. I understand it totally, I get the concept BUT, I wouldn't sit any one in a section that the server is closing out. With the huge dining room area that they have, they had plenty of tables to leave until closing. This is the one pet peeve of mine when dining. When the servers are cleaning and taking care of the rest of their work, they tend to forget about the tables and customers they still have. It takes forever to get the bill or refills. I always ask for two glasses of water and the check when they drop of the food."}
{"text":"Fantastic happy hours. Had 4 appetizers and a beer for $26. Jake is the best waiter and will help you with the menu and beers. Took incredible care of us. Highly recommend the guac, street tacos, and veggie quesadilla."}
{"text":"We ordered Jambalaya,  Jalapeño pretzel and chicken finger and a glass of raptor red. 
Jambalaya was good with juicy and tasty seafood and sausage. Pretzel cheese was a little bit fat and tasted like pretty 'cheese and butter'. Should be liked by cheese fans; chicken finger was coated with bread crumb and served with bbq and another unknown source.

The only bummer was the waitress did not go through us the happy hour menu at all and we had to ask if this is in happy hour or if that is in happy hour. But in general it was a good place to go."}
{"text":"Oh man oh man! Another review, and this time from the well known Rock Bottom in downtown Charlotte. I came here with a friend who wanted some of their beer as well as their food. And sadly, I wasn't impressed. Inside though they completely changed the outlay of the dining area from the last time I came here, which was about 2 years ago... They added ramps as well as new things to look at and admire, such as the glass between booths and some paintings. But, overall it's all the same with the looks and what not.

I had two things from the menu: Fish Tacos (RB Taco) and the Southwestern Chili.

Now, the good first. Southwestern Chili. It was awesome, I felt like it was very good and chunky. However, I wish the portion was just a wee bit bigger just because it was so tasty!

Another plus was the service. My friend ordered a steak and it was a little overcooked, the waiter completely understood and took it back to get another steak cooked medium rare. It was fast and I believe even the manager came up to fix the problem. They offered a soup or whatever, but my friend declined (I was wondering why he didn't get me another chili!)

Now the bad. Eating the Fish Tacos was like grabbing a handful of seasoned salt and then eating it. Every single bite was just a burst of not just salt, but just sodium with a little heat kicked in, but that was probably from the amount of salt and it made it seem spicier. After drinking water, it was still stuck in my mouth. Kick back the salt Rock Bottom and pull out that flavor of the fish! After all, it is a fish taco.

Overall, not bad, food is average. Service is pretty good though. Next time though, I'm sticking away from those tacos."}
{"text":"My boo asked me to accompany him to an ugly sweater party that his company was hosting at Rock Bottom this holiday season. They rented out the banquet room for the evening, so we loaded up the tandem and found our most heinous sweaters. 

The banquet room was quite small and could not hold all of the party guests. We ended up standing awkwardly outside of the room with other guests who were unable to fit. It was also extremely hot and stuffy. 

When my boo tried to order our drinks I got a lecture from our server about my still vertical ID. He told me to get a horizontal immediately (Ummm, who wants to wait at the DMV??) and that they normally didn't even serve customers with vertical IDs. I was a little angry about this since my ID was clearly valid no matter what direction it was. 

The drinks were pretty decent. I started out with the IPA (a little too sharp) and ended up having gin and tonics for the rest of the evening. We were pretty schwasted when it came time to bike home, and our tab wasn't too much either. And now that I have my horizontal ID, I can go back sometime."}
{"text":"Great location downtown Charlotte, nice menu and wonderful Hand Crafted Beer Selection.

Sports bar atmosphere with quite a few TV's located around and a few Pool Tables too."}
{"text":"We've all had this happen to us - you go past a place one hundred times and never go on. Then, once you finally do, you realize how many opportunities you wasted!

Rock Bottom is definitely a solid bar. As a microbrewery, their beer list is full of house brews. There are better beers in the world, but there are a lot of worse beers out there, too. 

What really makes Rock Bottom standout, though, is the food. My girlfriend and I shared an order of nachos, and it took everything we had to finish them. They also make a mean soft pretzel. 

The Waterfront may not be the most convenient thing to do while in Pittsburgh, but no trip to the Waterfront, is complete without a bite and a drink at Rock Bottom."}
{"text":"Here's the trick to enjoying a meal at Rock Bottom: don't get fancy with your food order.  Stick with the sandwiches, salads, burgers, and bar food; and you'll be OK.  I've had bad experience will all the fish dishes (including the fish and chips).  Also, I've found the service is generally better in the bar area than the dinner area.  Join the Mug Club, even if you don't go often, and rack up points for free mugs and beers.  Thursdays are Trivia Nights and the DJ is playing the music loud, so go if you don't really want to have a conversation with the person you're with :)"}
{"text":"This place has a fantastic outdoor patio and makes for a great place to sip back and enjoy a few beers. We split the brewer's feast and particularly enjoyed the southwest egg rolls with a roasted jalapeno ranch dressing. I enjoyed their winter seasonal and their Sweet Magnolia brown ale. However, they didn't make my top favorite beer selection and other than that I really didn't find any of their brews to be that great. Overall, I'd recommend going elsewhere with a better beer selection from multiple breweries. Of course, much of this review reflects my distaste for chain restaurants and breweries."}
{"text":"I had forgotten about this place and the great experience I described in my previous review : (

We found ourselves right next to this establishment and went there for dinner last Thursday.

We were seated promptly an the service was good.

Hubby had the cajun pasta, I had... some other pasta with tomatoes and basil, but I didn't even taste he basil :  ( Hubby loved his cajun pasta, I thought mine was so so...

We shared a southwest rolls appetizer, I thought it was OK.
Our friends had the calamari, and a tortilla soup. They said the tortilla soup was kind of salty.

Anyway, I will make sure to go back and have some of the cauliflower that I am raving about in my previous review : )"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.  We have lived here for 5 winters now. Never stopped before.  Wow we have been missing out.  Burgers amazing, and,so,was buffalo burger.  Beers good too, did taster and liked almost all.  Really enjoyed dark beers and pepper one.  We will return, also server Tommy very accommodating.  Will return as soon as can fit in schedule.  Great value for money."}
{"text":"Be careful. The servers can't pay attention to save their lives, and the management cares even less. I want to make sure people know how careless the management is, particularly Mark who seems to let his staff run around."}
{"text":"Wow what a disappointing experience tonight! The restaurant overbooked reservations and was so  unorganized that we waited for over a half an hour for the reservation and sitting with no menus. The servers rebounded, but never once saw management staff? The worst part is that it was a special occasion and 25% of the party was current or previous restaurant employees. It was embarrassing and sad. They get 3 out of 5 since the servers jumped on it and tried to make it better and the food was good."}
{"text":"first bad experience at this place. double swiss burger was as tasteless as they could make. I asked for medium cooked and they gave me burnt. instead of caramelized onions, they added raw onions. they should check the quality of jalapeños they use, it was not hot at all. they also forgot to add mayo.
ohh and they took 50 minutes to prepare this burger, and we missed our movie at amc. 
the waiter did not even bother to ask if everything was okay. won't visit again."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour before a movie and had the best server ever, she was British and her name was Natalie. Great (cheap) happy hour menu, tasty bar food. The cheese jalapeno dip was very good also."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a coworker.I ordered the apple salad.It was really good and exceed my expectations. The dressing was different than my usual taste but definitely complimented the salad.

I'm not sure if they were short on help or not but our waitress would get absent sometimes.The type of absent that when your check is delivered upon request you present your form of payment so you wouldn't have to wait again.Therefore,I am giving them three stars."}
{"text":"My boyfriend kept telling me about this place he had been to a few years ago with a really cool beer flight. Well, the drinks were about the only good thing about this experience. We were sat pretty quick but took 10 min to be greeted. It took another 10 to get the drinks and order. When the food came out, our server was nowhere to be found. All of the few times she came to the table she was pretty friendly and personable. We wanted water and extra sides of sauce and had to stop other people to ask for it. Our food wasn't terrible but it wasn't good enough to want to go back. Our server never once checked on us during our entrée. When she finally did come back, we asked for a box bc we wanted to go, another 15 min to get that. I found a manager on the way to the bathroom and told him I was not impressed and probably would not be back. The worst part: he knew who our server was! Before I could even say her name. That. is. awful. If someone messes up that often, she should no longer work there or fill a hostess position. 
The manager did take care of our bill, which was extremely nice. But I can't imagine they'll be in business for long if he has to do that for all her tables."}
{"text":"Valentine's Day dinner with 3 couples. We chose rock bottom because everyone had been there at some point. The beginning check in should've been a red flag for us to run. The hostess was answering phone calls, arranging menus and even walking off while telling us to hold on. There were several parties waiting to be checked in behind us. 10 minutes later we were sat. 
  Server came over greeted us promptly, took drink orders and asked if we wanted apps and gave us a chance to look over menu. Some drinks were returned from the bar while some never reached the table. This was how this went all night. 
  Oh boy, the kitchen and food. I ordered a 2am burger as well as my husband except his without hash browns. Runner brought food and started auctioning off food and when my husband and I couldn't decide who's was who's, HE GRABBED THE BUN OFF THE BURGER AND STARTED DISSECTING FOR HASHBROWNS! What in the world??!! Neither of us touched our food. Another couple ordered the Cajun Pasta and brewery beef tips. Both came out ice cold. Third and final couple, their order was the beef tips and a steak cooked medium rare. The beef tips came out cold as the others and the steak never hit the table. 
  Manager-- my husband walked off to find him so he could address it personally instead of making a scene. He told my husband he'd be back over in 30 seconds- several tens of minutes later, we had our server go find him. He said he'd bring out our checks. CHECKS? No. No checks. He agreed to comp food, especially what never hit the table. We paid for drinks and left our sever a gracious tip. We won't be back as we had to leave and go to Wendy's! Never ever again."}
{"text":"Good beer, food and service. Arrived on a Wednesday night for business and sat at the bar. Bartender was attentive and nice. Food was great. I had the Bison Prairie Burger. It was cooked perfectly and the flavor and fries were great. I'll be coming here again on my next business trip."}
{"text":"Always good food and great service. The bartenders Bob and Paul are the best!! Very personable and pour a great drink. The Brewery Nachos are excellent and any the Baja chicken is a must have."}
{"text":"Road runner brown and chicken mac n cheese. Good beer and good food, priced right and good service. Located at Arrowhead mall. Good place to get lunch near, but away from the mall."}
{"text":"I had the 2AM burger and it may have honestly been the best burger I've ever had! I also love their patio seating outside and the bar around the back. My only complaint (which isn't Rock Bottom's fault) is that homeless people approached our table 3 times during our dinner to ask for either money or some of our water."}
{"text":"Went there to watch NFL game.   Food mediocre at best and service was awful.  The only thing that could have made our waiter less attentive was if he had the day off. Stay away."}
{"text":"The only really great thing I can say about Rock Bottom is their location, it was perfect right before going out on a Friday night, but that's it.  Their menu is WAY overpriced, with nothing really great on it.  I just got the nachos (found as an appetizer) and my friend got the burger.  The nachos were overcooked and semi-stale.  The beer was decent, it's just draft beer here.  Service was good and the atmosphere was fine.  But I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night. Waited over an hour for a table for 2, but enjoyed some great beers from the bar while waiting. Ordered the calamari appetizer to start which was very good. My fish and chips entree was cold, but my boyfriends 2 am burger was phenomenal."}
{"text":"This place is okay. What I like is their own unique selection of beers they have to offer. Since they brew theri own on site and have many different \"flavors\" to choose from this makes this place above par for actual bar food fare. Their hops have a bitter taste so I wouldn't say their crafted beers are for everyone, they would best be enjoyed by IPA lovers.
Their bar food menu is alright, their fish tacos are pretty good. This is a good last minute place to check out a brew a snack and catch some updates on your favorite sports on their flat screens strategically placed through out the bar."}
{"text":"You have to try the Crispy-Spiced Salmon Bites with Pineapple Salsa - WOW! You won't be disappointed! Does have a bite, you've been warned! 

Service was wonderful! Not too noisy, but I came in on a Wed. night so might be different later in the week. Nice separate meeting room in the back. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Very good food and beer (apparently - I don't drink beer). Not quite the same feel as SoCal, but I still really like the restaurant and bar."}
{"text":"We recently moved to the area and decided to try Rock Bottom. The first time service was horrible, the waiter forgot our appetizer and never refilled our drinks. We waited at least 20 minutes for our bill after the meal was finished. The table we were seated at was also filthy. A few weeks later we decided to try it again. We sat at the bar and service was a little better but not great. We ordered guacamole and the bottom of the chips was a huge black hair. The waitress was completely unapologetic. Don't think we'll be going back."}
{"text":"Ok?? Has the health inspector been in the kitchen of this restaurant ever???  We were sat next to the Windows of the kitchen and this is what I was looking at- see pics. My wife and I would have left immediately but we were asked to meet good friends there for dinner  reallky concerned of dust and grime falling off heat lamps and ceiling onto food. There also looked to be mold on ceiling. Am I the only person to view this?? I took pictures  anyway let's talk food.  Ordered steak-Dennys  serves a much better one  service mediocre at best. This place seriously scared me with the cleanliness. Can't recommend on any level"}
{"text":"As I sit here inside of rock bottom brewery with my family to celebrate my bday I realized I've just had the worst experience of any of my bday. Needless to say this is my 40th which to me is a milestone but since it's on st. Patrick's I guess they figured they would make enough money off the bar and other activities that my family and I was not taken care of in the least little but. The service was horrible, from taking drink orders, appetizers,and entrees it was slow, nonchalant, and I guess they figure with or without this table we making money"}
{"text":"This place was never gourmet, but it's definitely gone downhill, as evidenced by the empty tables on a Saturday night. A few years ago there was at least an hour's wait. House brewed beers were below average. The wit bier tasted like a flat, less flavorful Blue Moon - and considering Blue Moon is not anything special, that is saying something. Beers took at least 10 mins to come to the table after ordering. Food was served ICE cold and was completely tasteless. The sandwich I got was mushy. I didn't eat 3/4 of my plate and noted that most others in the 8 person party I was with didn't either. Everyone said the food was sub-par. Would never return here."}
{"text":"Yes this is a brewery! You come here for fresh brews. The beer is good with a constant selection and a nice loyalty program that rewards you after multiples of pints have been enjoyed. The atmosphere is appropriate, lots of booths and a good large bar area. The food is typical for this type of an establishment. Good casual place with no pretense. Our service was prompt and efficient even with a larger group and they managed to get all the orders right and food out to us even with a busier crowd."}
{"text":"Had the pepperoni pizza tonight.  I realize this not an Italian place, but, anyone can do a good pizza if they really want to.  

Online menu said \"pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni\".

It had a typical single serving of pepperoni.

Pepperoni was almost tasteless. 
Cheese was totally tasteless, could not even tell it was there. 
Low quality pepperoni and cheese. 
Sauce is just ok, but, very light on sauce. Ragu pizza quick sauce is tastier.

The crust was the \"brick oven style\" burnt crust. Or it was just burnt. Now, I don't mind a brick oven crust, but, your toppings have to be able to hold their own against the dry, powdery, charcoal taste of the crust.  Here, it was all burnt crust taste.  

If you want something to munch while drinking, this may work. For a dedicated dinner food, you may be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came in today to have lunch with my husband. It took 5 minutes to be greeted at the door. It was our first time in so we were unsure if we sat ourselves or not. Finally a gentlemen came up front. He told us the bar was open seating. We sat and waited another 10 minutes to be greeted by our waitress. By this time I went back up front got our menus and we figured out what we wanted to eat and drink. We ordered everything right away. The food came out In a decent time but the services was slow. It looked like one server was on and maybe two managers. The managers were talking to the cooks or walking around aimlessly. Our server had a good 6-8 tables and they were not helping nor was the bartender who had maybe 4 people at his bar. The food wasn't good enough to make me want to go back. They have two flavored for wings so got forbid you like them hot. They are NOT. And the Ranch, terrible!! It was hot and watery. Pretty sure the health department needs to check out wherever they keep the ranch. Once we were done our server was again no where to be found so took 15 minutes just to get the bill and then another 10 to get her attention to cash us out. I won't be coming back and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It was also over priced for all that. If you try it out, good luck."}
{"text":"I love Rock Bottom. I don't frequent the restaurant side of RB as much as I do SingSing, but the food comes from RB. I order practically the same thing every time (Bacon Mac 'n Cheese, Brewery Nachos, and a beer...usually an IPA or a Manhattan) and the last two times I was at RB, the food was disappointing: it was cold and unappetizing, my Manhattan sucked, and the service was worse. The food is always better over at SingSing for some reason...even if they do come from the same place! 

I was craving the Mac 'n Cheese, so I went down to pick some up. I had a gift card, so I figured I wasn't out any money if the food sucked. I saw that there was a new menu, so I sat down to order. I got the Street Food Quesadilla, Bacon Mac 'n Cheese, and Beer Battered Onion Rings. I also ordered a Homemade Root beer and a few samples of the house beer.

Everything was amazing! It came out hot and tasted awesome. They have a new Head Chef and it shows. I was floored...the new Street Food options are fun and tasty. They are unique and different...not something you'd find at any restaurants in the area.

The Service was good. My waitress was named Liz and she certainly was on point. She even helped me find a beer after I was sorely disappointed by the IPA offering...which was weird. I always thought the House Brews were tasty and fun, no matter their style or make. I'm an IPA girl, but I would happily drink anything that came from their taps. I was disappointed in the offerings, but I ended up settling on the Pale Ale that was quite tasty.

In the end, if you were turned off by Rock Bottom before, I'd definitely recommend going back to check out the Street Food and new menu offerings. Service has dramatically improved, food quality has improved,  and I was thrilled."}
{"text":"This place is huge and therefore a good place for groups. I came with a large group on a work trip and we had no issued reserving a last minute table for 15 people. Food was good, nothing was extremely memorable but it's inexpensive standard bar food. Bathrooms were really, really messy."}
{"text":"Good food, large cheap beer samplers.The pretzels are delicious. As the name implies, they make their own beer, and most of it is pretty good. Usually plenty of parking. Food is good, although not that memorable and the typical pub fare with some pasta dishes. Still, worth a return visit."}
{"text":"For a brewery who is attempting to take advantage of Oktoberfest you wonder how at 7 pm they could be out of mashed potatoes & sauerkraut then a sausage platter with sweet mustard guess they have not been to Germany. Not worth $5.95 unfortunately the sausage platter was $15.95."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 0 star if I could. The short rib is salty and overcooked. We ordered the sample size ahi tuna and they charged us full prize. The prime rib was tough and half was fat. I will never come back.  This place Is scam. The waiter Eddie accused us of receiving the larger size ahi.  Unbelievable service"}
{"text":"Nice service and good food. I haven't been to a Rock Bottom since I got really, really crappy service at the one in Chandler 11 years ago."}
{"text":"Best service I've had in a long time. Food was great, bartender attentive. Told our waitress how much I appreciated her service and her friendly, upbeat attitude, said thank you. She came back with, \"I love my job\".  Told her it showed. So appreciated my evening after a very long, grueling day!!!"}
{"text":"It looked great from the outside however when inside nothing went as planned. Granted we did have a large crowd however we expected more class... Our drinks were never filled on time. Our food came out in waves so we were unable to eat together, the chief came out and started picking up dirty plates he never talked to anyone. Our waitress was very friendly but lost when it came time to deliver our meal. It could be an amazing place they need to tighten up service."}
{"text":"Everything you want from a restaurant like this. Excellent comfort food and our server was great."}
{"text":"Alisa is an amazing waitress. The food is AMAZING best food I've had in a long time The chicken fried chicken is good, the pretzel breaded chicken is good and the chicken macaroni is to die for."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been for beers a few times after we get done at the Improv, which is across the street.  They brew their own beers, which is a plus.  I think most are average, with the exception of the pumpkin.  If you go in fall and they havent sold out yet, try the pumpkin beer.  It was the best I have had!  It was really creamy and spicy.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. salad was nasty and appetizer was salty and didn't come with many."}
{"text":"I had a good experience.  I came with family and everyone enjoyed their meal.  I can't say it was spectacular, or that it's a must whenever I visit the area, but overall a good meal.  Oh and they'll validate your parking so thats a plus."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for her birthday and was unimpressed with the level of service! I ordered the bacon chicken Mac and cheese and got the first order with no chicken! Meantime my wife ordered a steak and green beans and when they brought her meal informed us they were out of green beans. We said that asparagus would be fine and then waited 15 minutes until I finally asked a different waitress to bring us the asparagus and to tell her there was no chicken in my meal. They apologized and said they would get me a fresh order started. 10 minutes later they brought out another order and STILL no chicken! After I sent it back the manager got involved. The third order had chicken but by that time we were done so I had them box that meal up. They did give us a discount but our meal was completely ruined! Very disappointing that my beautiful wife had to suffer through this ordeal! Unfortunately we won't be returning here anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Food and service are great. This is our go to place when we just want to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"Good beer, bad service, bad food.  I have been into multiple Rock Bottom Brewery locations and that seems to be very consistent among the chain.  

Needless to say, I probably will not be back to this location courtesy of our last trip there (see Will H's review).  It is a shame as this place has potential if they could get their food and staff in check."}
{"text":"Food is mediochre at best. Service is slow even by geologic time. The micro brew is typical and unimaginitive. On the good side the patio is dog friendly. One star just for that."}
{"text":"Saturday night at 5.  Great food.  Ale chicken was amazing.  Beer was great too.  Service was attentive and friendly.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Little slow on the service and didn't have the beer I wanted on the menu. But you get those things when they brew their own beers on-site.   But the stadium pretzels are good.  The cream stout is tasty.

The burgers are good and big with the little skinny fries.  I'm not a fan of the skinny fry, but hey the burgers would choke a horse - and almost did.  :o)"}
{"text":"Yes! Yes! Yes! If you are weak at heart...don't come here! Cause you wil experience multiple foodgasms!!! I was a fan before they changed the decor, and now it's that much better! 
My favorite app is the Artichoke and Crab Dip! 0_0 with the crosctini bread! OMG! Every entree has been deelish! They have it all from burgers, to salmon, to salads! All homemade...and we haven't even gotten to dessert yet (Which is also killer of course!). Seriously! Make sure a bed is near by after you waddle out of there! lol 

Melissa was our sever last night and she was super cute and super helpful! Great food! Great Service! Clean and Modern decor! Free parking! Descent Price! You just can't go wrong with this place! 

Complete and Utter Satisfaction! Guaranteed to please! Every time! ;)"}
{"text":"Dropped by after the Padres' spring training game to watch the NCAA tournament. All good."}
{"text":"Rock Bottom is a decent larger sports/brew pub seating is at a premium on weekend evenings, prepare to wait an hour to be seated at a table or try your luck scurrying against others as a high-top becomes available in the bar.

The food is average, nothing extraordinary...we did get the sausage filled pretzels bites, they had little or no  sausage in half of them (should have gotten the ball park pretzel)

They do offer a drink and wine selection but beer is limited to house brew only.

Update 1/2017 Be prepared to wait close to an hour for food...
And make sure you order to doneness, mine came pink with a bloody bun may be because the waitress said they are behind due to a large party"}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch on Feb 13. Had to wait 15 minutes for a table even though there were plenty of vacant tables. Seems they had a shortage of wait staff and then a back up in the kitchen. No biggie - our waitress was nothing short of amazing!  The drinks were cold, recommend trying the flight. And the food was absolutely delicious!  Will definitely go back!  Highly recommend this restaurant for the ambience, cuisine, and service."}
{"text":"Great food wonderful servers  Management needs to work on keeping  Floors and tables clean also the bathrooms are filthy! Serving food with dirty utensils! This is at the Arrowhead Location I would suggest coming here just hope management cleans up their act"}
{"text":"Average bar food, nothing to write home about. Corn tortillas average salad. Average...just average. Go support a local place that offers something different"}
{"text":"I was going back and forth between 1 and 2 stars.  Mostly because of the service.  

We called and had a reservation for 8.  Which was fine.  We were seated promptly and our server was VERY friendly.  However, that is where the decision between the 1 and 2 stars kicked in.

3 of our party were already sitting down with their waters when we arrived.  A few minutes later she came and took our drink orders.  I asked for a SAMPLE of a beer and my friend ordered a flight...and some waters.  She came and gave everyone else their drinks/sodas and we got nothing.  No beer.  No water.  Oh and an extra margarita that was wrong.  They fixed that and brought it back but still no beers or waters.  So I kindly asked our server (J) for our waters and they were just sitting on a tray behind us the entire time.  Mind you, the place was not that busy.  We asked for our beers...my tiny little sampler and the flight and she said \"OOOPS! I messed up...I'll grab them.\"  A few minutes later and still NOTHING.  So we asked again, \"OH they didn't bring them out to you?\"...40 minutes later and I finally got my SAMPLE of beer and my friend got her flight.  We then got our food.  Which was fine until we realized one of our party did not receive the main part of her dish.  She clearly ordered the brewers club with a side of onion rings, which the server quickly told her that it was a .95 cent upcharge, to which my friend was fine with.  So when we informed our server that  they didn't bring her sandwich and only a side of onion rings, she said, \"Well, I have to check the ticket for that.\" Ummm...you clearly understood that she ordered the sandwich and the onion rings because you mentioned the upcharge.  5 minutes later she gets a sandwich that was clearly thrown together at the last possible moment!  

We did ask to speak to a manager.  Our server brought him over and we very kindly, no really, we were super nice about it, told them of our issues.
*took forever to get water
*she wrote the wrong margarita orders down
*we had to ask for our beer 3 times and it took 40 minutes for me to get a SAMPLER.  (Manager said, \"it took that long for you to get a sample?\" YES!
*we didn't get the main portion of one of the orders because our server \"Messed up\"


He just nodded and said okay.  He didn't offer to comp anything.  

In the end, even after telling her who was on what ticket, she still made some mistakes on the check, but at that point we didn't even bother telling her and just figured it out on our own.  

Kindness only gets you so far.  Incompetence...yeah, that is what gets you 1 star.  It may not seem like much, but when you are sitting there waiting for almost an hour to get 2 oz of a drink...it is ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Nachos, pretzels, pretzels, salad, burgers and margaritas are a must have!!! Great place to watch the game!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. They are so consistent with everything there. From the quality of food and bev to service. They make their own beer their which is very delicious. They always have the same beers on tap but have rotating special brews. the beer is top notch. the food as well is great. they like to experiment which i like. the atmosphere is awesome. the red brick walls, dark wood furnishings, low level light, and the really beautiful copper bar makes you want to stay, relax, have a beer and read a book. on Fridays and Saturdays it gets busy but not bar or clubby. they are in a class of their own. Ryan the bartender is great, always remembers you, and greets you with a smile and your beer. BTW the brewmaster knows his shit lol"}
{"text":"It's rock bottom, you know what you're gonna get. We have this in DC and San Diego. 

Friends kids loved the pizza and fruit cup. Most even stayed on the table and not on the floor. this was a major accomplishment.  The milk and apple juice must have tasted great as well as they both had refills.

I had the Hawaiian Chicken which was really tasty, pineapple, rice pilaf and green beans.  Next time maybe something not \"chainy\", but this did hit the spot. no wait at around 7pm on a Monday. 

outdoor seating too - a+"}
{"text":"We decided to be basic and do dinner and a movie for valentines day. We hadn't been to Loews at the Waterfront, so decided on there. Since we were in the area, we also decided to dine at our favorite place at the Waterfront, Rock Bottom. 

While at home, I hopped onto Open Table at 6pm to make a reservation. One was offered to me at 6:15 as well as 6:30. We went with the latter to avoid rushing. We arrive at 630pm and were informed by the host that we would have to wait another 45 minutes to be seated. We asked why and mentioned our reservation. He said manager insisted walk ins have priority over reservations. I have no idea what world they live in but that is a foolish rule. Why even bother being on Open Table if you aren't going to acknowledge those reservations? I have worked as a hostess at a fine dining restaurant using Open Table.. it is not a complicated system so unsure how they managed to not make it work. We were upset. The guy said he'd put our name down on the wait list and to come back at 715!!!!!!! My boyfriend asked to talk to the manager because that was just cray. Luckily the manager over-heard our entire conversation and said he could seat us now. 

Walking through, I counted 7 open tables ready to be seated (plus our table). Since I worked in the food industry before, im assuming their kitchen was backed up which is why they didn't honor our reservation and needed more time before seating new guests. Fine, I get it. but explain it that way instead of saying \"walk ins have priority over reservations\". 

Despite that hiccup, we had a great dinner. As always, we ordered the firecracker shrimp as an appetizer. We also ordered their signature Champagne Mojito. It was a little too bitter (cheap champagne im assuming) Next time we will order just regular mojito. 

For entrée, I went to the Ale Chicken which is chicken, mashed potatoes, veggies served with mushrooms ale sauce on top of it was delicious and I highly recommend. My fiancé went with the Cuban Cristo.. a basic cristo which is then beer battered and deep fried. It was recommended by our server and bobby really enjoyed it.

There was an adorable paint night event in the side room. We still love Rock Bottom but I wanted to update with their official rule regarding reservations."}
{"text":"Beer good and cheap happy food portions have been downsized and quality not as good as it use to be."}
{"text":"We went for lunch on Sunday Afternoon.  We sat there for ten minutes and nobody acknowledged us or came to our table.  A waitress passed our table two times and chose not to make eye contact with us.  Servers congregated at the hostess stand.  We walked out and still nobody noticed.  This used to be my favorite place uptown.  Really disappointed."}
{"text":"Seasonal beers can be quite good. The regular beers are OK to mediocre. 

Food is typical for bars but kind of pricey.

They don't offer entertainment unless your idea of fun is to sit in front of the bar and watch ESPN."}
{"text":"It's spring, a warm breeze, you want to sit on a patio somewhere and have a beer, a good meal and hang out... this was the over whelming recommendation and they delivered.  I think Jennifer's review from aol was right on is stating \"Rock Bottom Brewery is the Tom Hanks of Center City dining -- all-American, unassuming and very, very popular.\"

I went with a client and this spot has a little something for everyone (even home brewed root beer for those that don't drink - an excellent selection btw).  I sampled the burger and made me question my selection, however, I had to try the fish tacos because of the way they were served.  Side note, the only item I've ever loved on the taco bell menu was the double decker tacos because of the soft and hard shells... well this is the way their fish tacos are served, only with cheese holding the blue corn shell to the soft taco wrap.  I've had better fish tacos but this is still something I'd order again.  

Lunchers tend to take their time and the service is always attentive, not pushy and generally very accommodating to the diner.  If you're in uptown and want a good beer (summer wheat and stouts were excellent), some americana fair or just a good spot to bring a client, this place is a great selection.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon my husband and I were looking for a place to watch college football while we had a late lunch. IT WAS AWESOME!! Every game you could think of was on. The service and food was great!"}
{"text":"went to lunch with a group from work yesterday.  Most of us had the Primavera Pasta which is soooo tasty.  Fettuccine with lots of veggies in a great sauce.  It was on their specials menu.  But, I hope they move it to their permanent menu.  They didn't have our table setup when we arrived - even though we made reservations.  So, we had to wait.  But, they made up for it with three free appetizers for nine of us.  Waiter and manager were fantastic."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in this restaurant for lunch on Saturday. We easily got a table. The appetizer of Asiago Artichoke and Crab Dip had no visible crab or artichoke, was very runny like soup, and had visible puddles of oil. It looked nothing like the picture of it on Rock Bottom's website, and it was the lowest-quality artichoke and crab dip that I have ever received at a restaurant. We told our waiter that we were dissatisfied with the dip. He apologized and took it away. I think that this was the only time in my life when I have sent a dish back to the kitchen. A short while later, the manager came over to apologize for the dip, and she offered us free desserts if we wanted. Our entrees of an avocado chicken and bacon sandwich and a cheeseburger tasted much better. We declined the free desserts, although we did appreciate the offer. Our waiter remembered to bring out drink refills. Our table and chairs were clean. There were TVs for us to watch while we ate."}
{"text":"I have been to this place in the past before they remodeled.  I enjoyed it.  I like the fact they brew their own beer on site.  You can tour the facility when there is time.  They are introducing new menu items and I was able to preview the new items.  I really enjoyed them. I will definitely have to go back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped in for some late dinner, we sat at the bar and Paul waited on us. I had the Chili and she had the chicken mac & cheese, both of which were delicious and the portions were huge! She had an angry orchard (Sam as anywhere else) and I had their Infinite Sun wheat beer which I enjoyed so much I had to take a growler home with me. As great as the food and beer was I'd have to say the best part of our meal/experience was our great conversation with Paul, as a fellow bartender Paul was exactly what I like in a server/bartender; attentive, personable, good recommendations, and an overall great experience. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love the beer here. I had a crappy experience last time I went. Server seemed to be more concerned with sidebar conversations with co workers than taking care of our party. Took drink order and went MIA. Our tab was 97 bucks before tip for three (off happy hour). I still recommend this place food is good, but can be pricey off happy hour though. Beers are great. happy hour is great the have half off apps yeah! I have had wonderful service here in the past and will return. They do to go growlers of beer!"}
{"text":"Went to Rock Bottom for lunch the other day and was very pleased. My coworker had printed out a coupon for a free mini appetizer. The waitress told us that they were not making mini appetizers and gave us a full sized chicken quesadilla. If you have ever had the southwestern egg rolls from Chili's - the filling tasted like that and I am a big fan! 

Mondays are half off burger days and I tried the just hot enough burger - topped with crispy jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, pico de gallo and housemade habanero ketchup. It was delish! The ketchup was so good and the fries were extremely crispy. 

The prices are a little steep for lunch but if you go on Monday, it's totally worth it. I think that the quality of food more than makes up for it but don't expect for pay under $10 for a sit down. 

I felt that the staff was very nice and the waitress was very attentive. The service was quick and I think you can get in and out in under an hour."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and it was OK. Food was mediocre and there was a nasty smell where we were sitting. Smelled like dirty mop water."}
{"text":"Meh... the only reason I even stepped foot into Rock Bottom is because I had a lunch meeting and it was at the suggestion of my dining companion. I used to go to Rock Bottom in Atlanta every now and then and it was ok... especially if you go for beer / happy hour.  I going to be blunt here right now though:  this place sucks!

Luckily, I enjoyed the company of those that I dined with, otherwise, it would've been a miserable experience!  Thanks for that, Miranda and Ken (if you happen to read this!)  

I had their cobb salad and it was pretty average although the turkey in it was nasty.  Our waitress was slow as hell.  The atmosphere (keep in mind we were there for lunch) was nothing special.  Rock Bottom is the reason that I'm not big on chains.  I don't think I'll be returning.  Even if I'm stuck at Desert Ridge, there are plenty of other dining options that are far superior to Rock Bottom (CPK, Yardhouse, Rubios, and more).

Sorry, RB - had to do it..."}
{"text":"Came here the other night with my guy after going out on a long planned date night to the hornets spurs game. Originally after the game we had planned on going to our old faithful Thomas street tavern, but we were to tired to continue drinking and just wanted food and bed. Most things were closing up that I suggested along the way until we came upon Rock Bottom. I had never been there and neither had he so we were excited to try something new. 

To be honest the whole experience started out wrong so I probably should have gone with my instincts and left right away. We sat ourselves in the bar area we could tell that was the only section open and well no one had come to seat us so sat we did. the server whos name ill keep out of this just because I believe people have bad days and sometimes you cant hide it even at work it happens to the best of us. however she was extremely short and the general impression we received was that she would rather not only be doing anything but serving us but that she genuinely didn't like us for whatever reason. She started by asking if we had been there before we said no she went over the fact that they were a brewery and what would we like to drink. We sampled one of their house beers that was on special that night. I said it was ok and that I would rather have a mixed drink. My guy asked if they had OMB copper on tap, she retorted \"no were a brewery we don't have other peoples beer here!\" ..... uh ok well then why is miller lite and Newcastle on tap right behind you I ask.. she said well we have a few I guess.... ok...... we then went over the menu and my guy ordered a ribeye well done (much to my dismay and whining about why he was ruining a perfectly good steak... I'm working on him)  I ordered the salmon.   About 5 minutes later our server returns to inform me that they had not necessarily run out of salmon but that at that point in the night they had already put it away (they didn't close for another hour or more) and that she would just get me a menu.. so I ordered a salad that sounded really good it was a smoky tomato and kale salad that I added shrimp to. when the food came out the steak was med rare (me happy my guy not so much) and my salad was a little bowl of lettuce kale and pico de gallo with some sort or spicy aioli for dressing that was really just mostly mayo. yuck. I was starving so at this point I just made do.  my guy asked the server once she came back to please put the steak back on the grill for a little longer since it was not well done. she just grabbed the plate and walked off then brought back his broccoli to eat without his steak so that \"he had something to eat while he waited\" she came back about 1 min and a half later with a steak that looked like had been gotten out of the dumpster, I mean it wasn't it was his but it had been microwaved into next year. This is not hard to tell folks and for my guy it was just an insult he cooks for a living and I served for 11 years its pretty much a huge screw you mr customer I could care less about your experience here with us.

He asked for more sauce since they microwaved it she brought it didn't say anything didn't ask how it turned out then once we asked for the check before she brought it she asked how everything was I said OK to be nice but try to get the point across she looked down at the plate she picked up rolled her eyes and walked off without another word.  A few minutes later brought the check for 50 bucks on food I would have been so much better off not eating. 

I know this was a long review but to end all I can say is when walking uptown and thinking about places to eat for dinner, pass this place up and try one of the other wonderful places uptown like ruths chris or capital grill.  I really wish I had just gone with Thomas street and next time given limited options well just be ordering pizza or hitting a drive through or just not eating. Everything about this place turned me off which is a shame I hate unhappy reviews."}
{"text":"I go to Rock Bottom all the time at my companies main office in California, so to find out there's one in Phoenix (although I live in Chandler, FAR away from the actual Rock Bottom), my wife and I were in the area this weekend and couldn't resist. I love this place. Great beers, even better food. The 2am burger can't be beat. The waiter literally handmade the rootbeer. It took him a couples tries to get it right for my wife, but he did it with a smile on his face and wasn't annoyed. One of the best brewery's I go to."}
{"text":"The staff was able to accommodate a large party (approx 20) people for a birthday, overall I would say I thoroughly  enjoyed the atmosphere. Had the chicken tacos which were actually good. Would give them between 3-4 stars and the service 5 stars. Uptown Amber was 5stars"}
{"text":"After being seated at three different tables we decided to sit at the bar.  We then found out they were out of lager.  How the hell can a brewery be out of lager?  The food was decent, the service was below average, and the crowd was the usual here in Glendale, old white folks."}
{"text":"I have dined at RBRB twice in as many weeks, mainly because of my craving for the Chicken-Bacon Mac and Cheese.  I absolutely love it!  Have tried their beer and and have found a couple that are really good, I just wish someone in this town served beer iced cold in a truly frosted glass, not just cold in a cold glass.  Others in my party had the fish and chips and the lobster-shrimp enchiladas.  Both were served hot and well presented and the taste was good.

Neither time did I have to wait to be seated, both times around 8:30 pm on Friday.  My servers were always attentive and friendly, so I have no complaints about the customer service.  Being on a time constraint, we enjoyed our beer, ate, and were out within the hour.  I will go back."}
{"text":"A cool place to hang out in downtown.  The food.is very good.  You cannot go wrong with the fish and chips.  I enjoy the beer.  Most of beers are brewed on site.  The only problem is the staff turns over very quickly.  Parking is free if you park in the deck under the restaurant.   Make sure yo ger your ticket validated.   Sign up for the rewards card.  It is not nearly as good as the previous perks card, but it can be uses nationally."}
{"text":"With so many good places to try in Pittsburgh we thought we would try Rock Bottom the night we went to The Improv.  Unfortunately, both service and food quality were not good. Server was slow.  We had to ask where our appetizer was and when she brought it, we ended up sending it back because it was cold.  We had to remind our server to bring our entrees to the table as well.  Burgers were overly seasoned and salty.  About the only good thing was the beer.

I hope they can turn this place around but for now we will not return in the future as it is the rock bottom.

Ps. If they do close for a bit, they could use a major remodel as the restaurant looks like an old tgi Fridays from the 90s inside."}
{"text":"Came out to Rock Bottom for a bite after a rough work day. Our server, Elizabeth, was funny, friendly and checked on us frequently. When our order was delayed the manager, Mike, came out to apologize personally. It was a great experience and you can't beat the price for delicious food and beer"}
{"text":"Nutrition info on their website is specifically formatted to make it difficult to follow so that should tell you something. Some of their burgers have over 5,000 mg of sodium for just the burger. Totally fine if it tastes fantastic and you don't care about sodium  

Also. No Splenda available. 

Tried the Mac and Cheese as that is usually hard to mess up. The chicken was quite tough and in long chucks. Not the best cheese flavor either. Somewhat bland and watery. 

The sizzling stuff pepper is sizzling not just on the pan but in your mouth. Much spicier than expected."}
{"text":"Wound up at Rock Bottom by chance had been wanting Carrabbas all day, due to being brain washed by commercials on TV so that when a friend said lets go out for dinner I was all gun ho to say Carrabbas, then he said Im in the mood for steak I tossed the pasta idea out the window and said Bring on the beef,  plus never been to Rock Bottom so I was thrilled at being able to try a new place! It was a Sunday night and the place was simi empty, which was nice. Service was fast and friendly and I liked the overall vibe of the place. I ordered the Texas Fire Steak which was top sirloin seasoned with crazy peper and smoking jalapeno butter, man it was delish!! Even the veggies were good!  Looking forward to another trip there to try out some more the menu!"}
{"text":"Better-than-average bar food with a great atmosphere. It's kind of a standard place to find yourself in nights out uptown...you won't expect to have your socks knocked off by anything, but you also won't have a bad time. It's spacious, too, so it's a great place to start the night off with a big group of friends. It's a decent place to bring kids as well...the menu is pretty diverse in terms of bar food, so it's good for families. 

My favorite part of this spot is the outdoor seating. You don't get a much better outdoor seating experience...you're right in the heart of uptown at one of the busiest intersections. It's fun to sit out there alone and just observe what happens. 

It's also a great venue for events. I attended a work-related party here, and the service was great. We all had a good time."}
{"text":"I usually get the burger here and it is almost always fairly quick and served fresh straight from the kitchen.  I was a bit disappointed this time as I took my family here this evening.  We waited for awhile for the drinks and to order. The food took awhile to arrive.  I can understand they can get behind when they are busy but the food was actually cold, not just for one of the five of us but for all.  I was really disappointed that the food must have sat there for several minutes before being served.  I should note that I mentioned it to the manager and they did not charge us."}
{"text":"We went in for drinks and sweets. We were notified immediately that the kitchen closes at 10pm. OK, cool! 3 of us ordered drinks and I ordered sweets. They said the beers were OK. I ordered the warm donut holes, those suckers are good. Service was average. Us girls went to the restrooms and wow... It is gross. SO GROSS! I decided to wait until we got home (and that is a 30 min drive)."}
{"text":"Came here to meet a friend for a late dinner.  We chose to sit in the bar area. Service was okay sometimes a little slow. My friend did enjoy the tacos."}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Friendly**

Went for happy hour and managed to stay until 8pm. At 5pm it was empty but by 8pm it was paced. 

Nachos and the jalapeno pretzel sticks are HUGE, definitely great shareable apps. This is the first place I've seen vegetarian flautas and they were delicious! 

Happy hour is every night of the week. Tons of food and drink options for HH. I wish they had mac and cheese and a dessert on the happy hour menu."}
{"text":"Hostess was not friendly. Establishment was not busy at all, decided to seat ourselves at the bar.

I got he blueberry lemonade and my friend got a martini. Both were nothing to write home about for $10.00 each.

There seemed to be an employee off the clock at he bar because she put in an order for herself by going behind the bar and enter it in the system. She was also handling some bottles, clearly not working with her purse and drinking at the bar.

This place just does not seem serious about business standards and drinks were weak. 

Only came here because the martini bar we wanted to go to ended up being closed on Sunday's."}
{"text":"Left duckworths and walked across the street to the best establishment on Tryon. Equally busy atmosphere however we were seated and served with our drinks in under ten min vs waiting a lifetime at poor customer service \"ducks\". Drinks, food, AC, and service was the best hands down at rock bottom. Stay out of duckworths and spend your hard earned money here vs there! Take care patron and please read to AVOID poor customer service at -Duckworths. Pro rock bottom negative on duckworths!!!! Go ROCKBOTTOM!!! AWESOME PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"Service took a long time to get to us so minus 1 star.  Now to the food...had the chicken fried chicken and it was probably the best I have ever had.  Moist and tender with a great crispy batter.  The cheddar mashed potatoes were awesome.  Will definitely be back! I want to try to 2 am burger. ..hash brown, bacon and fried egg on a burger...sounds delicious."}
{"text":"Decent.   

Several in our group ordered the Mac and Chicken, and all of us agreed with was more a casserole than a mac n' cheese dish.   As for the burgers and sandwiches, they were solid.  Beers were pretty generic but again, nothing to complain about.  Service was great and prices reasonable.

Rock Bottom exists in Seattle and it's seen as pretty lame, since you can get better food and a wider selection of beers at several other places.   Here, It's probably does a bit better."}
{"text":"Very good beer and food + a truly relaxing and comfortable setting = four stars. Prices were OK and the location is great if you are in or near center-city CLT. I had the Cajun Pasta & my wife had grilled shrimp with Mac/Cheese. YUM!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my girlfriend and her young boys after Discovery Place.  I had the Mac and Chicken - awesome.  She had the ahi tuna salad - which she said was delicious too!  It wasn't crowded at all - service was pleasant and the boys gobbled up their buttered noodles.  I had the Rock Bottom IPA - pretty good beer.  Overall we were very happy with our experience."}
{"text":"Grabbed lunch here with the Fam, waiter was pleasant but forgot my bloody Mary and then served my sister in law a sizzling steak over my sons head without an excuse me.

My wife loved her Seafood Alfredo my fish tacos were not so appetizing. The black beans are on point."}
{"text":"Would give this place a 5 star if the service was top notch. But it made the difference. Definitely a solid 4.5 star and great eatery. 

Burger was delicious.
Beers are amazing, of course.
Have tried a pizza, its pretty solid."}
{"text":"Football Sunday's are the best days! We went yesterday and took full advantage of the Sunday football specials. We love sitting at the bar. The bartenders are always so good! They are attentive and friendly!
Their beers are always fantastic. Great flavors and they always have the best variety. 
We got A LOT of food!! We got the nachos (MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE), pepperoni pizza and chicken tenders. 
Let me just say, the nachos are ALWAYS a must and have me coming back just for them. They are so good. They are gigantic and spread across a huge board. Every chip has the fantastic toppings on it. Can't speak enough great things about them. 
The pizza was good. I like the thin crust which helped it keep a crispness. It was a little greasy but hey they didn't stop us. 
The chicken fingers were good. Nothing fantastic. Loved the honey mustard sauce. 
All in all, we love it here. Such great food for a great deal. So thankful for this place being on our side of town. We don't have many good places on the Westside."}
{"text":"Charlotte NC Location. We had the nachos, firecracker shrimp, and the classic wedge prior to our show. All was good and plenty of blue cheese on the salad. Plenty of food as well. More than we could eat. Beer was good as well. Great service throughout!!  Nick was our server and he was great!!!  Will ask for him everything we come back!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty bad. Don't waste your time or money. Worst of all it's really not clean. Beer was good, but that's about it."}
{"text":"We went to Rock Bottom for a family dinner. Parking can be difficult downtown but they validate parking. We ordered a few appetizers including the crab dip. For an entree I ordered the veggie pizza. It actually tasted good. The only issue our group has was service. There were a few times when the order wasn't correct or forgotten. Overall good experience and they have a large menu that provides options for a larger group."}
{"text":"Happy Hour= good deals on drinks and appetizers. Some food is half-price and you get a couple bucks off a glass of wine or a pint of beer. 

Not an overly packed space, and it's pretty roomy, which I like. It's in a strip mall, but what in Glendale isn't? Mixed crowd of young and old, but very low on ye olde douchebagge scale. 

The pizzas and calamari on the appetizer menu were even pretty tasty."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped by Rock Bottom after seeing an event called, \"Cheers with the Brewer\" where they were advertising their holiday cocktails and providing complimentary appetizers. When we arrived we were automatically greeted by a hostess who found out for us where we needed to sit for the event. She told and lead us to where we were to sit and after a few minutes a waiter came and greeted us. He gave us the menus and list of specialty cocktails. I decided on the peppermint bark martini and my friend got their eggnog. The martini was amazing! I love that it was coated with a chocolate rim with peppermint pieces and a candy cane. All of the flavors came together sooo well and you could taste the peppermint, chocolate, and vanilla! 

The appetizers started coming around and all of them were amazing, especially the chicken and waffle \"taco\", which was a breaded and lightly sweetened piece of white chicken. We also tried their brushetta, which was topped with mushrooms and a light white cheese. Also, we tried their jalapeno poppers, which was an entire jalapeno stuffed with cojita cheese and lightly breaded. 

My dinner was the ale chicken, which was just okay. I was not impressed by the chicken or the grilled vegetables, but I really liked the black beans which jad cojita cheese sprinkled on them. 

Overall the service was good and the drinks were as well. I think it is worth returning to try again, but just another type of dish."}
{"text":"I tried all their beers; the seasonal was OK, stout was great.  Rest of them were not good IMO.  Food is so so - not really worthy of 3 stars and wait time was long but it was a Saturday prom evening so it's OK.  They got the third star from me for the service; waitress was great and once seated, service was extremely prompt and courteous.  I guess they made it a point to train their staff in explaining their different brews so that was nice."}
{"text":"Honey and I started with pints of White Ale.  \"And keep 'em coming!\"

I had the pleasure of dining here with my Mom-in-Law and Dad-in-Law, who had been divorced for 43 years but we're trying to put on a good act that they were the best of friends.

\"Hit me again Barkeep!\"

I opted for Lobster and Shrimp Mac and Cheese for dinner.  Something decadent.  Like a last meal.

It was delicious but not the Mac and Cheese with ooey-gooey cheddar cheese.  This was a grown-up version with Parmesan-Havarti cheese sauce over cavatappi pasta.  It wasn't perfect but darn near close. 

Honey had the Laredo Steakburger with Southwest-inspired Pepper Jack cheese, homemade guacamole, pico de gallo and chipotle mayo.  He said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had.

The White Ale was light and refreshing.  What I really needed was a shot, but I at least wanted to be sober enough to enjoy my lobster.  

Our Server was polite and attentive.  She always made sure to check on our table often.  I'm guessing the tension was obvious.  \"Another White Ale over here please!\""}
{"text":"First time at Rock bottom. Definitely a good price for what you get. Food was so fresh and hot when It came out. Happy hour from 4-7 and then again from 10-12. Beer made in house and definitely a good selection for every taste bud."}
{"text":"I had family in from out of town, and I wanted to take them somewhere in the uptown area where there would be something for everyone. They really liked it here! We had two flights of beer (the Firechief was everyone's favorite) and everyone enjoyed their food. Only four stars because the service was a little slow, but not awful."}
{"text":"Wow, one of the best Cobb salads I've ever had. Definite recommend! We're visiting from California and definitely wish we had one out there! Super friendly service too."}
{"text":"I've visited Rock Bottom a few times over the last couple months, courtesy of a gift card =)

They have really stepped up their game! I was always a fan, but I like it even more now. They remodeled and it has a better -- more upscale, modern, but not pretentious -- vibe now. Service (at the bar) has always been great!

They brew their own beer (and have local charlotte brews on their guest taps), both of the recent Seasonal Brews I tried were great - most recently Rocktoberfest. And you can always get a sampler if you feel torn. Their menu selection is huge and has something for everyone. This weekend I tried the grilled chicken with mashed potatoes and veggies - yumm! Next time, I'm eyeing the chicken fried chicken, ooo yeah. 

The only not-so-nice thing I have to say is, skip the pretzels. You can do much better at other places in charlotte. 

Other than that, I really like this place and I'm sure we'll be back!

P.S. They validate parking for the attached garage!"}
{"text":"I love this Rock Bottom, but you must understand that I weigh my decisions heavily on cost (my husband says I am really cheap). Rock Bottom has a really great happy hour ($5 appetizers and the nachos are huge!) and if you are a beer drinker than you have to sign up for the Mug Club. You get a bigger glass of beer and they give you points for every time you come and every time you buy a pint. Sometimes when new beers come out or other special events (like your birthday) they will just straight up load money on your mug club card. Free money...yes please. 

I really like trying new beers and it seems to be that once a month this location is tapping a new beer. On tapping nights they hand out free samples of their new beer and you can fill your anniversary growler for only $4. That is 72 oz. of beer for $4! For a frugal beer consumer like me that is the jackpot!

The food is really great too, but if you don't come during happy hour it can get expensive pretty fast :("}
{"text":"We didn't order a meal here, this review is just for the bar and an appetizer.

Never having had any Rock Bottom brews before (they don't have any in our state), we started with a flight of the basics and then ordered pints of a couple of others. We didn't have a single bad beer out of all of them. Granted, not all of them were amazing, but they were all at least good.

We ordered the soft pretzel appetizer, which really hit the spot. It came with two huge pretzels and a delicious dip. If you're a fan of soft pretzels, you'll want to get this.

The bartender was really friendly, talking to us at length about Charlotte and his previous residence Greenville (both places that we are considering for a future move), and we really appreciated the time he took to chat with us.

It may be a chain brewery, but the beer here was a fair sight better than at least one or two of the local breweries we visited during this tour of the Carolinas, so that says something!"}
{"text":"Their beer is just \"ok\". I tried the amber ale, kolsch, and white ale. Is recommend getting the white ale. 

As far as service, we wenton a Saturday night and the place was packed. Hostess said it was a 40 minute wait, which ended up being an hour... Our server was nice. Although, not knowledgable about the beer when we had basic questions.

Boyfriend got a burger and said it was ok. You have to order sides separately here (absolutely hate that). The side order of fries was so small. I mean give me a break. I split the BBQ pizza with a friend and we enjoyed it. Great flavors and the fried onions on top have it a nice crunch. Also, I would highly recommend getting a side of the mac n cheese. Request adding bacon jam."}
{"text":"Ate here with my mom and mother-in-law after shopping nearby. Everything was great from the service to the food!"}
{"text":"We were able to make reservations. The service was fast and we all ended up getting salads, which were fresh and delicious. The Rock Bottom brewed beer was pretty good as well."}
{"text":"I always love Rock Bottom....They have great appetizers and their lobster and shrimp tacos are superb. The prices are extremely reasonable...you can order 2 appetizers...2 drinks and a entree for under $40 bucks"}
{"text":"Rockbottom? What can I say. Hmmm. Don't throw rotten vegetables at me please. Okay, I'll say it: it felt like an upscale Applebee's.  Everyone was helpful and friendly; we didn't even mind the 20 minute wait (at  5:30 PM?). Did not care for their IPA. I love beer and only drank maybe half - tasted more like a Lager to me. Wife's soup was barely warm but she said the flavor was good. My Santa Fe Ranch Chicken Salad was just okay. Some of the lettuce was a bit limp and slimy. I did like the deep fried Jalapeno rings on top. Our waiter was really good but smelled heavily of cigarettes.  Our glasses never went empty and he even packed up our leftovers and bagged them. I think trying to run a good brewery and restaurant at the same time is a tricky operation. Sometimes one may suffer to highlight the other, or both may be slightly diminished as the operational  focus is spread thin. A-OK but not great. Go at least once and decide for yourself."}
{"text":"This place was A-MAZ-ING! We decided to go here for lunch not really knowing what kind of food was served. We ordered chicken nachos for an appetizer and the portion size was huge. We ordered the lighter meal smoked chicken tostadas, which were super flavorful, the jambalaya, and the sizzling stuffed peppers. There was so much food we had to get to go containers. For dessert we shared the salted toffee caramel and it was delicious! Both the food and the service was great."}
{"text":"We stopped in to grabs bite to eat before we went to Improv. My wife and I got the bacon chicken mac&cheese. It was absolutely delicious right down to the last bite. We raved about it all night long. Our friend got a burger and asked for it well done. It came out medium. So she sent it back. The manger brought out the new one and he took care of our friends check. Pretty great service. She loved the burger, and said it was one of the best she has had. 
I had the beer sampler and I liked all six beers. They were good. 
I would recommend this place and if we are down that way I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"So.....I have a small group of pretty amazing employees and I thought I would treat them to a nice holiday dinner and a comedy show.  I never thought they would be combined.  They have 2 long tables reserved for us which was very nice.  We had pre-arranged a limited 4 item menu and for drink tickets to limit the alcohol consumption.  I sat down and saw the menus had our company name....nice touch. The waitress came to take drink orders and knew nothing about the tickets.  I had to send her to see the manager and get that straight before the booze started to flow.  Then one of my people asked who else was joining us.....as 6 of the menus had another company's name on them.  
Let's say it went down hill from there.  Not everyone got salads.....the food took forever and then arrived cold and overcooked.  Nothing beats a grey steak and mashed potatoes you can pick up in one huge lump!!!  The funny part was, that they were not even properly garnished.  The steaks came unadorned, but the crispy onions they were supposed to include were on the chicken meals instead.  The delicious sounding \"maple bourbon glaze\" was totally invisible and tasteless, so I suspect that was left off as well.  Gordon Ramsey needs to be running the pass!!!!  After 2 1/2 hours.....still waiting on desert, I asked for the check as we were going to be late at the Comedy Zone for the planned comedy routine.  They then assured me that they could rush out desert.  The description was wonderful and I knew the staff....especially a select group would love triple chocolate brownies with caramel drizzle and vanilla ice cream.  So it arrived and was crunchy hard and the ice cream was a single melon ball scoop!!!!  People were so impressed!!!!!   NOT.
So......I dropped about $800 after tip and could have taken the group to Longhorn for less and had a LOT better meal and service.  
Might be a good bar to watch games.....it is not a good restaurant.  At least not for a small group of 16 people.  I suggest booking elsewhere."}
{"text":"Strictly based on the food not the beer, Rock Bottom is descent. 

The menu is extensive and a lot of the dishes sound really great, but nothing actually tastes good.The mixed drinks are weak and the quality and seasoning of the food is pretty bad. The service is consistently good. 

1. Sangria tasted like Kool-Aid, very weak. 

2. The vegetable medley is terrible, mushy, tasteless, very Wal-Mart.

3. The salmon was extremely over cooked, dry, and tasteless.

4. The garlic rib eye had a descent taste, but it was 6oz of meat and 6oz of fat. Half of the steak was completely inedible because of the fat and poor cut.

I wouldn't come back unless forced by a group of beer drinking friends."}
{"text":"We went here on a whim and caught happy hour by accident. Our beers were good, our food was good, our waitress was nice. It is just bar food but it was good food for a good price with good service."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon a mid-day courtyard party at Rock Bottom which was pretty cool. 
They had live music and $3 beer specials. 
Obviously this isn't all the time but if your in the area you may want to look into it and see if they are doing anything special. 
The environment was great. The courtyard is outside and open and has small fountains around. It's great if you want to kick back, laugh and converse with friends. You can essentially be as loud as you want and the atmosphere makes you feel free. 
Customer service was great! They check in with you and make sure you have what you need. 
I wasn't fond of the $3.99 up charge for a shrimp substitute because she didn't mention it. She said yeah sure. It would have been nice if she made the cost known. 
The food was good. I had fried pickles and bacon shrimp Mac and cheese. There was nothing special about the food...you probably could get both options elsewhere (and they may be better) but it was still good. I definitely wasn't disappointed. 
The drinks were also good. I got cocktails and green tea shots. 
The pricing was $12-$18. Not too bad but 
What really pushed this restaurant to 4 stars was the atmosphere, live music and service. 
I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"THIS LOCATION IS CLOSED. Desert Ridge and Arrowhead are still open, per Rock Bottom's website!"}
{"text":"Grabbed an early dinner with a girlfriend tonight at Rock Bottom. 
When we got there, we chose to eat outside as it was a beautiful day. The patio was nice with elevated (stool) seating, which may be a deal breaker for some, but the patio is not near the main road so not a ton of cars going by, a plus. 

The waitress came to our table quickly to get our drink orders and I asked for the happy hour menu [I could not find it ANYWHERE prior to my visit so I added a pic to the Yelp posting, you're welcome :)]. Though the menu is quite small, especially with foods, the foods really are a great deal. An especially good value are the pizzas (choice of margherita or pepperoni), because they are a nice size (8 cut!) and very delicious, you will probably have leftovers as I did. My friend said that the seafood tacos were very good, and they did look very nice on the plate. Their greenhouse salad is also delicious and a good portion, and they have their own spin on it- there's raisins and salted sunflower seeds sprinkled on top. Normally I would be reluctant for these in a salad, but it just works! Their salad dressings are all homemade but the dressing cups are extremely small so I had to ask for another.

All in all, decent food, our service was great, food came within a reasonable period of time. Happy hour is the only time I can see myself coming here in the future because the food is worth the price you pay during happy hour. (I am giving 4 stars because I had a great meal at a great price with great service, but I can completely get why others would rate lower if they paid regular prices for the same food)"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Rock Bottom has all the makings of a quality bar and grill but just doesn't deliver quite like I thought it would.

At places like this, I have two main expectations: 1) Good beer with lots of it on tap. 2) Good bar food. And it goes one for two. The beer is tasty and cold, as it should be, but the bar food didn't do it for me. Burgers are a little awkward, think greasy bar burgers with bleu cheese. It just didn't float my boat. 

The service is always good and it's a better place to drink than to eat, even the desserts and appetizers are good, just not an all-around contender for favorite bar and grill."}
{"text":"Love the patio here, if it's nice out and you are a big fan of people watching (like me), then it's about as good as it gets.  The bar area is nice as well and spacious which is something sometimes overlooked by other establishments.  Give me room to drink and socialize!  Anyway, I've been here on multiple locations both dinner and lunches and never been disappointed at all.  They have a great selection of food (online menu is available), from shrimp and grits, to great sandwich's, steaks and seafood.  

I will also tell you the service has never been bad, for me at least.  Always prompt and never lacking. 

Bottom line for Rock Bottom is......you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times because my friend likes the ahi tuna salad.  She loves it.  But I'm not meeting her here anymore! The restrooms are always disgusting.  No matter the time of day or day of week! The menu offers a lot of choice, but not a lot of non beef or non fish options.  The service is always a little slow.  And the tables are sticky! I do like their light beer, but since the bathroom is deplorable, the last thing I want is to drink beer!  Sorry Rock Bottom, I gave you a fair shot, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"We decided to go to Rock Bottom before a movie.  We walked in and were informed that there was a 30 minute wait for a table in the \"dining room\" but that we could opt to sit in the bar area.  So we did the latter.  There were lots of open booths in the \"dining room\", which was kind of frustrating, but I know that restaurants have to stagger their tables so the kitchen doesn't get overloaded...but seriously, it's a big restaurant...

I've been to Rock Bottom several times, both in Denver and Arizona, and I've never had an overly pleasant experience.  During our meal I was reminded why I don't really go out of my way to eat here.  The waitress would disappear for long periods of time, and all the other waitresses wouldn't make eye contact with anyone other than the diners at their tables.  Frustrating...

We had the pretzels to start, which were really good.  But, in my experience, even microwavable pretzels are delicious...It came with a side of cheese sauce with some herbs in it...honestly it tasted like velveeta, cilantro and rotel canned tomatoes.  Sub-par.  

I had the steak spinach salad, which was described as \"fresh baby greens with gorgonzola, walnuts, tomatoes and red onion tossed in a balsamic vinegarette\".  The red onion overwhelmed the salad.  The tomato was mealy.  There was hardly any gorgonzola, and the walnuts were nonexistant.  I was bombarded with soggy croutons.  Rock Bottom is just not the place to spend money on food.  It's a bar with a handful of unique beers.  Yard House is MUCH better if you're looking for a dining experience/brewery, and it's closer to the theater.  And their spinach salad rocks."}
{"text":"Even though I don't drink beer, I've been going to Rock Bottom since I lived in San Diego. And have always had a decent experience.

I stopped in for lunch. I got the Mac and cheese with NO chicken , it comes with a salad.
Huge portions, Cold plate and chilled fork for the salad was a nice touch. The Mac and cheese was piping hot and really good. (see pics)

Two people could have shared the mac and cheese, I couldn't finish it, even though I wanted to.

Friendly waitress, refilled my drink and brought my check in a timely manner."}
{"text":"So Weekends are usually hubbys choice and he decided on Rock Bottom.

I don't mind coming here, I really like their Mac and Cheese.
You can get it with or without chicken.........years ago the chicken was this really thin shaved peppered chicken and I thought it was awful so I have since always ordered without chicken.

However today Hubby chose the mac and chicken and I was surprised that now they use real chunks of shredded chicken breast!! YAY! 
What and improvement!! It was really good! (see pics)
. 

I got  the Turkey Bacon Cobb sandwich minus bacon =Layers of juicy oven-roasted turkey breast on grilled sourdough bread with sweet peppered bacon, sliced avocado, roasted tomatoes, sprouts and mixed greens. Topped with rosemary dressing and Bleu cheese crumbles (see pics)

It was better  than I expected, they forgot to put avocado on it though and
the bread was really really good and for being grilled it wasnt over saturated with grease.

The onion rings could have been crispier but were OK.

Lame waitress today she was new but whatever...she sucked!!"}
{"text":"My spouse and I have been here before in the afternoon when it wasn't too busy and we loved the beer, music, and service. We decided to come back and it was us and a group of friends and on a Saturday night so it was busy. They were low on staff and it was march madness and Saturday in Queen City, so taking all that into consideration we of course understood delays and such. When it came down to orders and service though, sadly was disappointed. Our friends shrimps came out ice cold with luke warm steak, forgot the glaze on the side, when recommended by the server and requested. The veggies were overly salty table round. And meats were not cooked to request and the servers forgot the eating utensils. I believe Rock Bottom needs some food warmer lamps under the order window or something. My spouse ordered a drink and since it was taking too long the server took it upon herself to make them their drink, but it was horrible. Let's just say there's a reason bartenders are the bartenders. Appreciate the effort, but we'd rather wait for the drink to be made properly. We also saw our server taking shots at another table and found it inappropriate to be drinking while working. Our group of friends also moved to the outdoors to get some air and my spouse apparently forgot their phone in our seating area, so I returned and there was another couple sitting there. I apologized and asked nicely if they have seen a phone, they said no and they offered to help me look. I then remember seeing someone lurking at our table so I approached several servers and asked about it and then I asked the hostess if anyone has seen a phone and the hostess searched and apologized and said no and if i leave my info at the desk they will call if anything turns up. I called the phone multiple times and it was already shut off when i knew it had sufficient battery. A server offered to go speak to the manager. It may seem ridiculous, but I did make a small scene searching for it. And it may seem rude but I had my suspicion it was one of the servers who took it. I was writing my information down and another server approached me saying one of the other servers found it and gave it to me.( And yup still shut off and if they had any intention to return it, it wouldn't have been shut off and when I turned it on it was set on mute.)  Obviously the one who took it did not want to confront me and apologize for \"attempting to steal\" my spouses phone. I was about to call the cops after writing my information down because of my suspicion and make a report, but didn't because we got it back and wanted to get the heck out of there and it left a bad taste in my mouth. It may be just a phone but it's the principle and respect of property and as a customer it was a disappointment. This is my FIRST review on yelp & most negative review on a restaurant personally. This place has reached Rockbottom."}
{"text":"Tasty and yummy.  I had been to a Rock Bottom before in Bethesda, MD.  I texted my buddy that I went there with and she said that she'd hope it was the restaurant and not the figure of speech that I was at rock bottom.  OH, that was a good start of the night at Rock Bottom.  

I got the brew house chicken on the server's recommendation.  Great choice.  The season vegetables were green beans and they were fantastic.  Cooked perfectly.  Not too hard and not too soft.  Perfect.  They were out of mashed potatoes by the end of the night so they substituted with fries, which was fine.  

The beers were tasty.  I got the sampler because I couldn't decide on one.  I eventually got the red ale, which was perfect for the weather.  Good place.  Only bad thing about the night was that I left my favorite credit card!  I called back the next day, but they couldn't locate it.  I am certain that I left it in the check folder that comes with the bill.  I'm used to the credit card being placed in the sleeve on top instead of the side sleeves with the receipt.  Shame, but that didn't ruin my trip to Phoenix nor my delight at Rock Bottom."}
{"text":"This place is very average.  Very nice decor and the menu is pretty good but the atmosphere is crapola. especially for a brewery.  Trying to be upscale but it really doesnt get there.  Not bad for lunch specials but overall this place is just average."}
{"text":"This is our \"LOCAL\" for a few very good reasons.  First the over-the-top friendly atmosphere here, every time we have been here. Second, Jeff's fine beer and ales. Third, the service is ALWAYS the best with very special mention of Tommy the bartender. Next is VALUE, very reasonable prices and the best made meals around."}
{"text":"We enjoyed an awesome Valentines dinner here!  Had reservations for 8pm, showed up about a half hour early and were taken right to a booth as requested.  Amina was our server for the evening, and she was great!  Very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu.  I ordered the Perfect Patron Margarita, it was average for my liking but I certainly didn't let it go to waste.  For the appetizer we tried the Jalapeno Pretzel Sticks with the jalapeno spinach cheese dip.  The pretzel sticks were huge!  The cheese dip was like a spinach queso blanco.  Anima highly recommended the Brew House Chicken, grilled chicken served over white cheddar mashed potatoes and seasonal veggies.  The grilled chicken and potatoes had a brown mushroom gravy on it...YUM!  Veggies were also cooked perfectly!  Hubby had the 11oz sirloin medium rare, and that's how he got it, with mashed potatoes and lemon rice.  Overall great service & great food, two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Wow, it was awesome!  We were served by Jessica and James and they were fantastic.  They were attentive and extremely helpful.  We also met Jeff, the Brewmaster, he gave us information on all of their brews and he was spot on.  They have the most fresh and flavorful beers around.  All of our meals were beyond perfect, my father swears that his burger was the best he has had...EVER! This will be our go to place from now on.  Thank you for a great night!!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend have been coming here for the last year and we love the place. I usually get the wheat ale and my girlfriend gets the kolsch. We split the nachos with chicken and it's always filled us both up. 

Service wise it's very good. We have one or two subpar serving experiences but otherwise it has been flawless. The same server usually takes care of us and he's always great. 

They currently have the rocktoberfest brew that I'd highly recommend. It is what got me hooked on this place."}
{"text":"If I'm not here once a month I must be out of town. Comfortable bar scene with attentive service especially from Tommy. Nice rotating list of beers with staple every days. Food isn't out of this world but the reliables are the Cobb salad, ale chicken, and fish & chips. Lots of screens with Every NFL game and game day HH make this a nice venue for some sport watching."}
{"text":"Amazing service! I have dietary restrictions with Gluten, and they took care of me! Busted out their internal menu which shows the ingredients for everything! Grilled me a chicken breast with steamed veggies and it was perfect! Perfect portion perfect seasoning... No salt! I loved it. Thanks for understanding and taking the time!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting a Rock Bottom.  

The food here is a little bit better then average.  My main draw would be the drinks.  They brew their own beer (obviously) and it is really good.  The flavors and options are not extesnive, but the selection is a good one.

If you are looking for a change of pace, visit this Rock Bottom - the staff is friendly, and service is quick.  Oh, and the Titan Toothpick appetizer is awesome!"}
{"text":"Great food & craft beer.
My husband is a craft beer guy and he loved the 6 he tried. I went for the food, had the Veggie Burger which had black beans and was amazing! Had the tomato soup as well, interesting, but also good. ONE negative, though- NO WHOLE WHEAT BUNS?! What restaurant doesn't have whole wheat bread alternatives these days?!"}
{"text":"First Yelp post ever...service was so bad I felt inclined to do it. Fiancé ordered bison burger and ended up getting a 2am with egg, etc. I had garden salad which was good however my Mac n'Chicken had absolutely no roasted chicken in it whatsoever. Apparently it's supposed to be \"loaded\" with roasted chicken. Informed manager and he brought us what we initially ordered but the Mac and cheese with roasted chicken was swimming in grease and oil. Fiancé ended up with a bison burger that looked like a slider on a regular sized bun. Bun was also cold like just out of the refrigerator. Sent that back too. Manager apologized and offered us another beer, we asked for the meal to be comped. When server asked us how our final meal was once my fiancé got a normal sized burger I asked if there was supposed to be that much grease in the Mac and cheese and all she said with a shrug of the shoulders was, \"I think so.\" Unacceptable. When she came back with the check she ran off with the Mac and cheese not even asking if I wanted it boxed. Food was comped but drinks still on check. After waiting 10 minutes we had to bring the check in to pay; fiancé ended up asking for the manager to let him know what happened after he brought us the corrected meals. The first thing out of his mouth was \"it's her.\" He was asked by the manager not to post anything on Yelp but I promised nothing. Let's hope the manager can move this place in to a more professional establishment."}
{"text":"My family and I always go to Rock Bottom for the holidays.  Tonight I showed up with 14 other members of my family and they turned us away.  They said the restaurant only had 3 servers that night and wouldn't be able to help us.  Seriously?  It's the Sunday after Christmas and you weren't able to find enough servers for the day?  On top of that there was no sincere apology or anything.  All she said was they turned away an 18 person party right before us and had to do the same to us.  I tell her this is bad... Her response? \"Yea...\"  Like the food and the beer, but an odd way of doing business."}
{"text":"I guess you could say I'm biased. After frequenting Rock Bottom for the past several years, it's clear I enjoy their $3 wine at happy hour, ahi tuna  and generously-topped nachos spread evenly over a massive plate (more cheese coverage that way).

Their beer is decent (I prefer Four Peaks), and appetizers are munchable. Currently they're running a $5 special on hors d'oeuvres.

I would personally steer away from the hummus, which came with a heaping platter of fried bread, sweet peas and another veggie that currently slipped my mind (carrots, maybe?) The dippers were just fine but the hummus lacked flavor. 

Great patio, cozy hangout and little to no pretension. Overall, an enjoyable experience every time :-) If only it wasn't a chain..."}
{"text":"I love their dark beer and veggie burger!"}
{"text":"This is \"my place\"- if you come to town, we eat here. If you want to grab a drink, we'll go here! We even spent one horribly drunken New Year's Eve partying it up with the Rock Bottom crew. This would normally be a 5-star review but I feel like their service has gone downhill a bit in the last 6 months and this could stand to be addressed.

First of all, you cannot beat Happy Hour! As a beer snob, I often feel left out when the Happy Hour specials only include America's favorite urine-colored watered down drinks. Occasionally I can get a Sam Adam's or Blue Moon, but it's nothing to match. The specials here vary by the day but you'll be able to get a pint of beer or a mixed drink for around $3- sign up for their free Mug Club and you'll get 20oz mugs every time too! There's a patio with smoking on one side only- it's great to sit out there most of the year but does get packed close to the weekends. 

The food specials at Happy Hour beat the oh-so-cheap yet mediocre Applebee's standard. Most appetizers are $3- a few items, such as sliders, show up just for happy hour and aren't even on the regular menu. There is a burger they offer for $5, and you can get a bucket of fries or kettle chips for $1.50. The sliders are my favorite (both chicken and beef), and i'd also recommend kettle chips, the spinach artichoke dip, or the nachos. 

The beers could almost use their own review- there are 6 or 7 to try and account for what people like to drink. There is usually a special seasonal beer along with a cask-conditioned option. As I mentioned before, the best way to drink beer is with a Mug Club card. You'll get a 20oz mug for the 16oz price and accumulate points towards things such as logo pint glasses. If you like the urine-variety of mass-produced beers, try a Dreamcatcher. If you enjoy good flavor, try the El Jefe Hefeweizen, Desert Trail Pale Ale, or Raptor Red. At this location in particular I think the El Jefe is the best. 

The food is delicious- i'm getting to the point where i've tried almost everything on the menu. The standouts are the Mac N' Chicken, the Lemon Chicken, the Smoked Salmon Fish and Chips, and the Prime Rib (they run specials on this at various times of the year). A lot of entrees come with the wonderful White Cheddar Mashed Potatoes, and the vegetables you are served are pretty flavorful. Definitely good enough to deserve coming here even if you don't drink beer.

My only complaints lately are that the service has gone downhill. We've been several times in the past few months- 3 times for happy hour and once for dinner. One time at happy hour was perfect, the second our food came out and had clearly been sitting around (coagulated cheese skin on top of the artichoke dip), and the third the food had only sat a tiny bit but it took us forever to get the attention of our waitress. The time we went for dinner the food was good, but it took a long time and didn't come out all at once. If the restaurant can resolve this, it'll earn its 5th star."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend and boyfriend we got two appetizers to share which was PLENTY of food. We had the nachos with added chicken they were delicious and the jalapeño breadsticks. The flights of beer were only $6 which was great and they write the name of the beer you're drinking which is a bonus. The reason for the missing star in my review is the service was lacking. They took a long time to come over to us we were sitting there watching every waiter/waitress go by for a while until someone came to us. We even walked up to the bar and asked if we had to order from them."}
{"text":"Stopped in before the Panthers Sunday night game. Sat at the bar with my buddy.  It was not busy.  The bar was dirty and no one made an effort to clean the space where we were sitting.  Gross.  Bartenders were terrible and not attentive.  Waited 10 minutes before someone asked if we needed something. Unacceptable. The beer was decent, but once we finished we waited a while with empty glasses before finally having to ask for another. Do the bartenders here not work on tips?  Because that's how you get stiffed. Only plus is the beer was $3 and they validate parking."}
{"text":"How do you not noticed that one of the people at the table did not receive their meal. The waitress who took the order said, well, other people delivered it. She took no responsibility.
I asked specifically if the lobster and shrimp tacos had pieces of lobster in it. The waitress said yes. There were tiny pieces of what looked like artificial crab. No lobster. 
One of our party had Caesar salad. Caesar salad should not be too spicy to eat. 
I'd give it zero stars but Yelp won't let me."}
{"text":"The bar is the place to be, it's like Homestead's version of Cheers and the game is always on TV. The beers are cold, well priced, and the pours are 20 oz. The food isn't winning any awards but will get the job done to soak up the suds."}
{"text":"Nobody has reviewed this in a while, but I am surprised at the lack of lovin'!  My husband and I ate here a few nights ago and we liked it a lot.

We started with drinks--he got the house-brewed Portland Wheat and said it was quite a good beer, and I got a mixed drink (Red Rock) that was also tasty.  

He got a burger covered in mozzarella cheese and I got a mahi sandwich.  Both great--the fries and side salads are good here too, and there is no skimping on portions of anything.  There were tons of things on the menu that I'm looking forward to trying.

We are usually not dessert people at all but ended the meal sharing a triple chocolate stout cheesecake--who can resist a beer cheesecake, come on!

Our food and service was great.  They had the Penguins game on all the TVs in the bar and were setting up live music for after the game.  Seriously, what's not to like!?  I'm thinking this place has changed for the better since the last review a year ago... :)"}
{"text":"When I'm on vacation, I try to go to restaurants I try to avoid chains because what's the point?  I want to eat local eats.  As I walked in, I realized I've been to the one in Long Beach, CA though the menu was completely different. Or perhaps it was the late night menu but it was decidely more \"Southwestern.\"  Ah well, it had been several years and it was quite late at night so it didn't matter at this point.

I ordered the green pork tostada which the waiter assured me was very small and the hot wings. The tostada was huge. What a liar (yes, I called him that to his face). 

I ate a couple of bites and finished the wings. I would have the tostada cold and congeal-y in the morning before flying out. Surprisingly, the flavors were locked in this way and acceptable as a 5-minute scarf fest. 

Oh, and my vodka tonic was very good.  Not bad and I kind of dug our picnic style bench high top table."}
{"text":"I'm giving 4 stars mostly because of the beer....large selection & decent prices.   The food is pretty good, but nothing to rave about.  The menu has a good variety, and everything I've tried has been good.  Portions are large.  

One side of the restaurant is the bar & bar atmosphere....with several TV's & 2 pool tables.  It's very wide open with extremely high ceilings.  The other side is more for families or people who aren't concerned about watching sports.  In general, it has a relaxed atmosphere.  I've always had quick & friendly service.  

I love the whole Waterfront area....so much to do!"}
{"text":"Food was good and the staff were very nice. I was staying at a terrible hotel nearby and this definitely lifted my spirits. Tried a couple of items off the happy hour menu at the bar and they were decent portions, even had leftovers."}
{"text":"Food, Beer and SERVICE was fantastic--our server--Stephane couldn't have been any nicer and attentive!!!"}
{"text":"I had the Tuscan Chicken Pasta. It was very well seasoned. My son-in-law had the Cajun Pasta, being from Louisiana it wasn't very spicy, but good nonetheless. Pleasant atmosphere, good service."}
{"text":"The waitress was awesome. Thanks Victory for telling us your secrets. Rock bottom is a really good chain. the difference is in the service when visiting one of these places."}
{"text":"At first our waitress seemed very snotty; I was very tired from work and travel and I asked her what type of beer was the happy hour special and she said it was on the menu 11 times.  But she warmed up to us pretty quickly, and they had some great happy hour specials.  Good food and good beer."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday afternoon after an afternoon of shopping in Glendale with my husband..Happy Hour 3pm-6:30...Jackpot!

The flight of beers is a bargain is you aren't sure what you want or like trying new things.  $6 for 6 4 oz pours.  The waitress was even kind enough to let me pick more than 1 from the specialty list.  The Blonde and Heff from the House regulars are both very good, but the Three Pepper Ale was AMAZING! super light and refreshing with a slight kick.  We were so disappointed we could not get a growler to go to share with friends on game day!

Tried the spicy sausage and cheese pretzle bites on ($2 HH).  Loved them, but if that is the regular portion, then not worth the regular price (6 bite size pieces not with 4 bucks)

Shared the Cuban Cristo sandwich.  AMAZING.  It is Ham, Cheese, (hold the pickles), pulled pork, honey mustard and mayo on sourdough and battered like a Monte Cristo with sweet and spicy jelly. DUDE...you should try it!

Our service was great in the bar area!

Will be back when we are shopping in Glendale!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Rock Bottom for many years and am a loyal member of their \"mug club\", which, if you come more than once, you should sign up for because membership comes with a few nice perks.
Rock Bottom brews some of their own beers with a nice variety of ambers, reds, and IPAs.  Typically when I'm here I like to sit at the bar or in one of the high tops near the bar where you can seat yourself.  If weather permits they also have a nice sized patio where you can also dine.
Usually I'm here to share appetizers and my go to is the ballpark soft pretzels with the cheese dip.  They also serve some pretty good nachos. 
When ordering from the menu I've found the grilled chicken BBQ sandwich to be a HUGE HIT.  This is one delicious sandwich.  
Prices are reasonable, service is typically good, and the beer is flowing.  Nice option when in the Waterfront area."}
{"text":"The staff here is very nice and the set up has TVs all around the family so enjoy mostly all sports, the music is nice and pretty mellow and the place is very spacey and the prices are pretty reasonable. And most importantly is the place seems to be kept clean at all times."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and nice service. Great ribeye....tasty lobster shrimp enchilada that is very unique twist! Bourbon pecan pie dessert is awesome!"}
{"text":"We had not eaten here in few years because of bad service and being served a hamburger so rare it was not legal to serve (which was sent back twice ) We thought we would try it again since we had a BOGO coupon. The Jambalaya and chicken tacos were amazing. The service was excellent. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a really nice place! They have a nice variety of food and cocktails. My man always wants the bacon Mac n cheese and I enjoy the Cajun pasta. So many good things about Rock Bottom. Try them out!"}
{"text":"The happy hour is amazing -- I wish the had a smoking section outside, but that's fine. I can deal with that.

I got $5 guacamole with chips first. When they say \"made to order\" they don't mean that you can customize your guacamole but rather that when you order it, they make it (which I though was the assumption for all food, but whatever.)

Then, I got the $5 vegetarian quesadilla which was pretty good -- the mushrooms were a little weird, but otherwise it was tasty. Came with sour cream and more guac, which was nice.

Bartender will give you samples of their beer, which is good. Both of their IPAs and very tasty, and one is particularly stong (10%ABV). I would highly recommend sitting at the bar, watching some baseball, and hanging out like I do.

Great place."}
{"text":"SUMMARY:
If I was in the area and no one had a better suggestion for where to go, I might come back for beer and appetizers.

GOOD:
- Decent beer...
- Original pretzel appetizer.  You take chunks of soft pretzel and dunk it in spinach cheese dip.
- Huge portions.  Most of us had leftovers.  The RB Appetizer Sampler was multi-story and way more food that we could handle.  The half order of ribs looked like a full rack.
- Attentive service with quick seating and frequent drink/water refills.
- Amusing name.

BAD:
- Lots of food choices... burgers... steak... chicken... salads.  Lots of drink choices... beers... wines... mixed drinks.  I guess this could be seen as good, but it takes a while for everyone to pick something and since no one's awesome at everything, you could tell right away that nothing distinguishes this place.
- None of the food was super awesome.  Nothing was awful, but nothing stood out in any way.  I've had better beer, appetizers, and a better main course at plenty of breweries.
- Kind of dead on a Monday night with 3/4 of the place empty.

Come if you want bar food, but keep your expectations low."}
{"text":"So ordered rock bottom and it is the rock bottle of the restaurants. I ordered a half Cesar salad and the traditional wings to go. Once i got my food at home my order was completely wrong,. My salad had three leaves of lettuce and the salad was one of the worst Cesar i have had. The 3 leaves were completely dry and tasteless.So upon just throwing my money away. Open my box and find boneless wings and not what i ordered.  I called back one of the 2 times. Someone answered the 1st time and then they placed me on hold and hung up.  I called back and no answer. I repeated this 5 times and no answer.  Biggest wast of time and money. Do yourself a favor and skip rock bottom."}
{"text":"Rock Bottom: A Cautionary Yelper's Tale.

You might say, \"I've never heard of Rock Bottom, there's no way that they are a chain restaurant.\" Beer? Apps? Bros? Sounds like a good time, but be careful or you'll end up on the rock bottom.

After a 30 minute wait staring at half of an empty restaurant with the usual goofy decor you would find at a Buffalo Wild Wings, we were finally seated. We could feel the tension from other diners that something wasn't right. The manger was running around apologetically and the food was casually sunbathing under the heat lamps. We immediately ordered a few apps but just like GOT, and now our watch begins.

We waited and waited to finally receive the saddest, tiniest plates of food with bloated chain restaurant prices. The food was uninspired, tired, and ordinary. The only reason why I am giving them 2 stars is because of the extremely gracious and apologetic wait staff who took off 20% of our meal due to the terrible service. 

So if you have decided to take a seat at Rock Bottom, take comfort in knowing that even the staff seems to know your pain."}
{"text":"Beer! Free parking! Great place to have some good brew. Great bar food."}
{"text":"Meh. We didn't have reservations, we came in at 5:30pm on Saturday night so we sat at the bar. The place has a good atmosphere and was packed. I made the mistake of using the bathroom before ordering my food. The bathrooms were gross, the stall doors has nasty finger marks and white crud pasted all over them. Seriously, like a porno was shot in there. 

This is a brew pub and you can see the brewing tanks by the bathrooms and to the side of the main dining room, they do give tours to diners. Due to diet restrictions, I had a vodka & club, it was mostly ice. I ordered the blackened fish tacos. They weren't blackened and covered in remoulade, I really question why I ate them. I couldn't eat the beans and rice and the bartender substituted that for vegetables. I think it was soggy slimy fried apples and sweet potatoes, but who the heck knows (not even the bartender knew what it was). I did eat the Brussels sprouts that were mixed in. My husband had a burger, nothing to write home about. We will take a pass on this place, just not good enough to chance again."}
{"text":"What happened to this place? We have been here quite a few times and this last visit will probably be the last. We had bad service from the get go. No one sat us right away the servers were walking by looking at us but no host came. I had trouble finding anything on the menu that on a hot day in phoenix sounded good. Everything is pricey too for being so-so food. Salads are $10 and up. A trip to the bathroom grossed me out with greasy smudged hand prints all over the black stall doors. Walking back I noticed the floors were covered in crumbs and food. Our little boy dropped something under our table and let's just say they can keep it because it was filthy under there. 
No more rock bottom for us!"}
{"text":"From a couple of weeks back we were more looking for a place that did beer first and then the food would be \"nice to have\"  

Early Oktoberfest seemed to be the theme as they were stuffing kraut onto, into and around everything on the fly out menus but it was pretty much just the shape of kraut and,unsurprisingly,nowhere near what passes for it when it's been made by people that care. 

I had their 2am burger which, is  described as having crispy hash-brown and an egg atop the burger which sounded like a good idea 3 hours prior to 2am. Problem is the crispy hash-browns were in the form of a patty that wouldn't be out of place at McD's in the am:(   Seriously why bother getting the rest of the ingredients together , steakburger, egg and bacon then just shoving a frozen potato turd atop it?   Treated as a bar with food gets it a low 3 , treating it as a restaurant .. yeah let's not go there."}
{"text":"Yummy! 

6 of us ventured into this Uptown Charlotte restaurant around 6:30 and I was a little worried that it wasn't very crowded for a Friday night.  We were able to get a table right away....... 

And lucky for us....... everyone of us LOVED our dish. I had the Fish and Chips which were made from fresh Haddock perfectly battered and fried.  It was served with an excellent Apple Slaw that awakened the senses in my mouth. 

The Commissioner loved his drink and my glass of wine was hearty and full bodied. 
His dinner was an excellent adult version of Mac and Cheese with Bacon and Chicken.

As we were leaving the place was starting to get busier and busier. So stop in if you are in the neighborhood.  Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Sitting here currently and the service SUCKS! Do not come here. Rock Bottom in Nashville is ten times better than this one will ever be. The beer is great, food is pretty good but waiting for beer for 15-20minutes and our server took 12 minutes to approach the table and has pretty much been absent after a couple of quick stops. Such a shame, the Nashville location is really amazing, with a great rooftop and great service. The Charlotte location, not even close! Oh yeah, and our order hasn't even been taken yet. SMH!"}
{"text":"2 word review: sub par.

more-than-2-word review: good location if you're in uptown, lots of seating, decent service. 

The food, however, is pretty bleh. Everything I had was bland with the culinary prowess of a microwave burrito. 

Crab and artichoke dip was runny, like hot yogurt with the same about of flavor as crab meat (...so, not much). 

I got the margarita pizza which was edible but that's the only redeeming quality I can give it. I was with a group of a dozen or so and everyone's summary of their food seemed to be \"meh\".

Basically, if you like Applebee's... you should come to this place and pay more for the same food."}
{"text":"Favorite stop! Great Beer and Food!! Tiger Fan Friendly!!!"}
{"text":"For anyone who ate here before BJs bought out the chain, the quality has gone down tremendously. Burgers and fries just don't taste the way they used to. They're gross now and taste frozen. Will not go back!"}
{"text":"Thanks to the staff here
For being so friendly and
Cool with our whole mess*

*rock bottom allowed our bachelorette party to eat and drink and hang after dave and busters orphaned us"}
{"text":"Mostly come here for the beer and sports. Fun place!"}
{"text":"2nd time at this location and was worse then the first time.
Didnt have filets or pork sandwich. Ordered aspargaus and didnt reiceve it but got charged. Took a very long time to get drinks, refills and the  food. Saw another table get up and leave because drinks took to long. The steak was just ok. The mash potatoes where a 5 though. The ribs where pretty good, smokey flavor."}
{"text":"Great spot! Busy but expected for a Weds @6pm. Service was fast - luckily found 2 bar spots. 
Cheap Happy Hour specials & the nachos were HUGE!!! Beer was cheap and good we had the Belgian for the Weds $3 dollar special. Excited to try the other beers they make.
Within walking distance to the Hornets game, definitely will be coming back to try other Happy hour food specials & more of the beer!"}
{"text":"Was only here for drinks so this is not a reflection on food. Tried their standard flight and greatly enjoyed the Xm@s but nothing else stood out. Also had the Gentleman, Holly's Mistletoe and Lively. The Gentleman was good in my opinion.  2 out of 8 beers impressed me and above standard for my tastes while the others were below standard when it comes to craft beers.  Again this is my opinion. I have a wide range of styles I enjoy but IPAs are a solid choice for me.  Pricing for flights was excellent at $6 for 6 4oz. tasters.

The service was lackluster. Myself and two friends were sat and the waitress took my order and the other man but ignored the girl that was with us and walked off without even asking her if she would like anything. She was a bit put off to say the least. We tracked the waitress down and she apologized but the rest of the stay was a bit awkward.  

I hear the food is very good and will return to try it and adjust my review accordingly."}
{"text":"Service was below par, waited a 1/2 hour to be served. There was only 20 people including folks at the bar. 10 minutes after ordering we were told one of the items that we ordered was not available, and they didn't wait around to obtain the new order. We had no idea who our waiter was because we saw about 3 people while we were there. Our food came out with a small amount of fries when the fries are suppose to be bottomless, but we were advised the fries weren't ready. The service was just God Awful"}
{"text":"Watch the fat girls in here. They will try to steal your buddys chair in a sec if he goes to the bathroom & then the indignent fat girl had to get yelled at in front of everyone w/ in ear shot. Everything else including the burger & beers I devoured was excellent."}
{"text":"I have to say that I've only been here when it was very busy. I found the service fairly quick and any of the food I've had has been delicious. I went there tonight and there was an issue with my food. Without going into detail, I will say they handled it wonderfully. Our waitress Mallory was very kind and she was quick to fix the problem. I had the salmon for the second time and it was just as amazing as it was the first time. I had one beer that's similar to a blue moon and that was good too. I would go back again!"}
{"text":"I went to Rock Bottom this past weekend, and it was \"nice\" to see that nothing has changed in the year or two since my last visit. While the beer is pretty good, it has never outweighed the fact that the service isn't good and the food is average, at best.

It was even difficult to get beers at the bar...we tried to have the girls order, thinking they'd have better luck...when that failed, the men tried...that didn't work either. If we hadn't REALLY wanted a cold beer after a comedy show at The Improv, we would've just left. It definitely wasn't busy enough to be noticed and ignored by the bartender, so I can't overlook it. Of course, the service has always been spotty at Rock Bottom, so it was hardly surprising.

Combine the weak food and poor service with Rock Bottom being too far from home for a night out just to drink, and you get the exact formula that's kept me from going there in the past...and will keep me from going often in the future."}
{"text":"Huge selection of beers.. Ambiance is also great.. food is awesome....try the chicken nachos...just awesome !"}
{"text":"We like this place for casual lunches and dinners. It's right in the heart of downtown and it's huge--lots and lots of tables, along with a huge bar and plenty of outside seating--so it's pretty convenient for all sorts of days and times. It gets pretty crowded, especially during the lunch crunch, but because of its size, you'll never really have to wait all that long. 

My girlfriend lives for their fish tacos, so if that's your thing, order away. I like their burgers and sandwiches--great club sandwich, good fish and chicken sandwiches, good reubens, great chicken finger sandwich. Roch Bottom features a lot of standard pub food, done up a little nicer than the options you'd find at most places. Though it's original, Rock Bottom has more of an Outback or Applebees feel than a pub. Not a bad thing. 

They've got a great selection of beers, many of which are, obviously, their own creations. Try 'em all. They're really good."}
{"text":"Incredibly mediocre. Looking from the outside, I was hoping for so much more. This is the definition of \"don't judge a book by its cover\". Large portions, but, the taste and everything else with the food is just, MEH."}
{"text":"Rock Bottom seems to be hit, or miss. They have a pretty decent menu with a variety of items. Their happy hours is sort of ho-hum for me. There's not really a lot of good deals to be had, but beers are relatively well priced even when not on happy hour.

I had gotten two vouchers from restaurant.com and used those on two separate occasions. The first time I got the prime rib, and though I was excited to order it, I wasn't excited to finish it. It tasted as thought it had been cooked too long and there was very little flavor or moisture remaining in the meat.

However, still having another coupon I returned a second time. The second experience I ordered a steak. My wife ordered on also. I ordered mine the house default which is a little bit between medium and medium rare and it was delicious. Well-seasoned and cooked perfectly. My wife ordered hers more well done and it came out very well done. The flavor was not great, even for her. I realize that it goes without saying that it is usually best to order what the kitchen is good at doing, but be cautious in ordering things well done or you might get it really well done. We had chips which are rather cheap and they come with a sufficient serving size and decent salsa. If you like hefeweizens they have a great wit-bier that tastes similar to blue-moon with a greater serving of cloves. It tastes good and I was a fan."}
{"text":"My family and I went here yesterday. It was quite an experience. The food in the drinks and everything we're good and the manager was very nice. They had some problems with not having the pretzel sticks so they comped us an appetizer and our waiter got my husband and his cousins order wrong they comped us that meal. We would definitely go here again everybody was real nice and the waiter although he was new we were the best group to learn from because we're very patient people we were there for about two and a half hours. I would recommend this restaurant to anybody we don't have one near us where in South Carolina."}
{"text":"Southwest Egg rolls and Fish tacos. Mmmmmmmmm. Ohh and the AMAZING Brews!"}
{"text":"Last night one of my friends had the opportunity to perform at the Improv, so I stopped by the Rock Bottom Brewery in the Powerhouse in the Flats beforehand.  I can't say that I go to the Flats...well...ever, anymore, so it was nice to see that at least a few businesses are alive and well.

I met up with a large group of former co-workers and my boyfriend and I grabbed a seat at our ridiculously large table.  The server immediately came over to us and asked us what we wanted to drink and seemed a bit miffed when I said I needed a minute.  When she came back, I gave her my order - a pomegranate martini - but then she completely blew off my boyfriend because he was talking to someone else.  He had to flag her down and get her to come back to our table.  She begrudgingly took his order.  When he asked if we could be put on a separate check, she said they normally don't do that for large parties.  So he asked her if they can't or if she just wouldn't.  She said she wouldn't.  It reminded me of the good old days at Dick's Last Resort in the Flats where the servers were supposed to insult you.  

I was sad to see that there were very few vegetarian options.  Their website had listed an entree that was meatless and sounded so good.  They have an extensive happy hour menu - with items ranging from $2.99 to $6.99, but I wasn't really in the mood for just an app, so my boyfriend an I ordered soft pretzels to split and I got a modified salad.  The two enormous pretzels came with a spinach artichoke dipping sauce that had a nice spicy kick.  My salad was huge, but it wasn't anything spectacular.  It was just your average house salad.  My boyfriend had the $4.99 happy hour wings and said they were extra spicy.  I think he referred to himself as a fire breathing dragon after he ate them.

At the end of our meal as we were getting ready to head to the Improv, the waitress brought us separate checks.  Hmmm.  I appreciated it, but she could have been nicer about it when we originally asked.  Too bad tip was included.  If you like cheap bar food, this is a good place to go...just don't expect great service."}
{"text":"Stopped off for a late dinner. Not very many patrons eating dinner, but more folks at the bar watching the football playoffs. 
I ordered lemonade and my wife had the Dream Catcher light lager whcih she thought was heavy on the 'hops'. For dinner she ordered the Laredo and I had the 12 oz New York Strip. 
Our server was knowledgeable and attentive. Our food came in a timely manner and was very good. I, especially, enjoyed my steak which was cooked medium rare, perfect. The vegetables sliced and cooked just right and the white cheddar mash potatoes was great. My wife's meal was also tasty.
All in all, it was a very satisfying meal. We'll be back."}
{"text":"My other half and I frequently go to Rock Bottom to watch a game, sit at the bar and relax. The bartender is always attentive, witty and fun . 
I like that they will allow you to sample the beers before you order, or you can order a sampler to try a little bit of everything. As far as beer goes, it's pretty good. Not mindblowing or spectacular, just pretty good.  We don't order anything other than the appetizer sampler, and it is SO tasty, with a good selection of yumminess to split between the 2 of us."}
{"text":"The ONLY reason this place gets two stars and not one is because our server was fantastic: he split our bills no problem, didn't screw up water orders, put up with a colleague's silly antics, and got our food to us promptly. 

The food was bad, yo. Like, below Applebee's bad. We split an order of guacamole. For $8.50, you get a tiny dish of it and a bunch of chips in a little bucket. What a crock. The guacamole was fine, but for $8.95, you can go to Vida over at Epicenter and get (as I wrote in a previous review) a veritable fuck-ton of it prepared tableside.

I also ordered the Southwestern Turkey burger. It sounded delightful - peppers mixed in with the meat, jack cheese, fried jalepeños - but tasted like garbage. The meat was tasteless but spicy, the jalepeños were in five tiny bits on top of the burger, the cheese was like plastic. The bun was overly bread-y. I ordered with a side of fruit, which was disappointingly not fresh.

My colleagues complained that their food sucked too: overly dry burger for $10 and a dried out piece of salmon for $18.50. What the fuck.

People, don't go here unless you want to get ripped off and eat shitty food."}
{"text":"I would like to start off for saying that the service at Rock Bottom has always been very good. The staff is always friendly and attentive. However, the food has gone greatly downhill over the years. I used to really enjoy my meals here, but i have been let down time and time again in the last few months. I come semi regularly to the trivia night they host and am usually disappointed with my food. The chicken they use is often dry, rubbery, and flavorless. It honestly looks like the scraps that have been left out for days. Our food also comes out luke warm. 

Update: my friend found pieces of plastic wrapper in her carrot cake. Pictured below."}
{"text":"First time coming to this restaurant. The waiter offered her advice and answered our questions in a cordial manner. They give you samples of beer which its a plus! The booth they seated us was next to the kitchen and it was a little loud but nothing that a person can't handle. They had Tv's all around and were showing hockey."}
{"text":"This place is ok, we seem to stop by here every once and a while because their happy hour is decent, and the food is good, they only have their beer so its good to go for something different, their mug club is pretty cool, you get rewards depending on visits or pints bought, plus they put a $10 credit on it for my birthday. Haven't had the best service but it's a pretty chill place."}
{"text":"If I could design the perfect all-around restaurant, this would be it! Casual, but not too much. Wide range of food: from wings, to burgers, steaks, salads, fish tacos, and a ton more. New and clean inside, with an awesome bar area as well as private tables. I also love their outdoor seating, both the front and back sides. I've been coming here for almost ten years now, and still love it. The perfect neighborhood restaurant, whether you want a full steak dinner, or just wings and beer with friends."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been in here a few times, mostly to drink, but we decided to have dinner tonight. We sat at the bar, took several minutes for the female  ( I won't say her name) to ask us what we wanted, w/o a friendly smile and a hello. My friend ordered a ribeye and she asked what sides he wanted. Well he didn't quite read all the sides and asked her what sides they offered, she said, 'it's on the bottom of your menu'. Ok I get it, maybe he should've checked all that out, but at least rattle them off for us my friendly bartender, geez. Our food was pretty good, altho pesentation lacked, but we won't be back because of service. Really? The 'drinkmakers' need to get out of the food industry and let the ' bartenders' go to work. As we were paying our bill there was a male bartender who I have seen there before, yes I said bartender, and he asked us if we would like anything and if we were doing ok, I thought, well buddy, too late."}
{"text":"Been to Rock bottom multiple times, just as always had a great time. Our server was Donna, great server and she knew a lot about the beers.

The manager was walking around checking in on tables so I asked him for his suggestion from the menu. He suggested the Chicken Parmesan pasta with the \"Smoky Mountain\" pasta sauce and a side of marinara.

It. was. amazing. Perfect recommendation. Had a great time. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"If they had half stars I would give it! The service at this place was awful! It wasn't busy at all and our waitress barely came by to check and fill drinks. After waiting forever for food it came out cold no I'm sorry freezing cold! Went to get ketchup bottle it was empty so went to grab the next bottle and it was empty too. Had to try and find a manager all the staff just looked at me stupid like they didn't have one. Finally Got a  manager over and she took the plate to the back and warmed it up and brought same plate back. No apologies! It's insane to be a place in downtown Charlotte and charge way too much for cold food!!!! This place is awful! So here we sit cold food and no refills!  I couldn't even finish my meal I was so upset with how bad this place is."}
{"text":"I've been by this place 100 times, but never thought to stop in. We started with the honey barbecue boneless wings, with ranch and blue cheese dip - extremely tasty. We ordered jambalaya and Cajun chicken pasta, because were both jonesing for some southern cuisine. It was pleasantly well done. The atmosphere was nice and shady, a nice respite for a hot day. Between the numerous TVs and the clientele, it was pretty loud. My wife quite enjoyed their mango tea, an unusual choice to see on a menu. The portions were generous. The service was friendly."}
{"text":"Been coming here for several years. I would come more often if the bartenders were friendly, had personality and made you feel welcomed.  Maybe you have to be a regular- regular to get that?!"}
{"text":"I last ate here about a month ago on a date. We were at Desert Ridge and just randomly selected it out of all of the restaurants there. The food was fantastic, but I cannot say that the service was anything special. The place was no more than 3/4 full, but we still had to wait a a few minutes to be seated. When we were brought to the table it still needed to be cleaned. We also waited quite a while for our server to first come to our table. When we received our food, my date (who had ordered a side of mashed potatoes) was given fries and with and apology was told they were out of mashed potatoes.  Then she was asked if she wanted anything else.  I had salmon which was great. In all fairness, it was Sunday night at about 8:00, and I know that peak business hours are far from over.  But, I still expect a little more of an effort from any business."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been in Rock Bottom but I was uptown for the Shriners parade on July 4th and figured this was a good place to find refreshment on a hot day.  

The restaurant has limited hours right now because they are in the process of remodeling so I had to visit them after the parade instead of before.  

Anyway, I started out with sampling their beers.  For a chain brewery, these aren't too bad.  The Belgian white was very refreshing and had a wheaty flavor.  The Hoppy Red ale was quite good and better than a normal red and then I moved up to the IPA which also had a smooth hoppy taste to it.  

As for food, I just wanted something light so I ordered an appetizer...the Pepper Jack Chicken Nachos.  Well light isn't what I would call this.  The plate was huge and came with sides of salsa, sour cream and guacamole.   In the nachos, there were sliced onions which often seemed a bit too large.  Also the chicken was in large pieces and I think would have been better with smaller either shredded chicken or ground chicken.  The chicken was also very dry.  I'd also expect a little spice from something that had sliced jalapenos and pepper jack cheese but there wasn't any.  The salsa wasn't even spicy and it seemed like more of an italian chunky marinara sauce than a mexican salsa.  But hey the guac was good, if that's any consolation.

Service-wise, I sat at the bar and both of the bartenders were friendly and helpful.  

So for beer, they get a 4.  for Service, they get a 4.  But for food, they get a 2.  And this averages out to slightly better than a 3."}
{"text":"Went here this weekend for lunch and to watch the football games with the family.  It has a great atmosphere and is very clean.  I had the Santa Fe Chicken Salad and a couple of their in house brews.  The salad was excellent and their beers were pretty good as well.  The service was really good, first thing our waiter asked is if there was any game that I wanted to be put on the TV (I think more places should do this) and was extremely helpful through out but not overbearing. I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Didn't enjoy the food at all. Cocktails and beer were very bland and didn't taste good at all. Nice atmosphere and the inside is really cute!"}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch the other day, as he had been talking about some of the great lunch specials they have, so I decided to check it out.  We got there shortly after noon, and I think it would be an overestimation if I said that the restaurant was 50% full.  Luckily for us, that meant quick seating, and quick service.

Our waitress was very attentive, quick to take the orders and to refill drinks.  Thought the wait for the food was a little bit long, but not too bad.  Rock Bottom currently has around 19 daily lunch specials that range from about $6 - $7.50.  Throw in the $1 10 oz beers, and that's a pretty good deal.  I ended up going with the Chicken Fried Chicken over mashed potatoes and a handcrafted root beer (more than $1, but bigger than 10 oz and free refills).  The CFC was good, cooked well and nice and crispy.  It went well with the mashed potatoes, though the gravy covering the potatoes was weird.  The root beer was average at best.  It doesn't even compare to what I can get at Culver's...

I only went this time mainly because I had a gift card that had been burning a hole for awhile.  I might be back for the lunch specials though.  Rock Bottom gets 3.5 stars, rounded down to 3 stars/"}
{"text":"Came for dinner with my boyfriend and sat at the bar. It was a great atmosphere on a Thursday night. We ordered the chorizo and cotija pretzel bites as an app and they were delicious, we had just wishes there were more of them! It came with six small pretzel bites and a jalapeño mustard dipping sauce - so good! I ordered the RB Ale Chicken. It was delicious. It came with cheddar and green chili mashed potatoes (amazing) and veggies (equally as amazing). My boyfriend ordered the chicken fried chicken (also delicious). He subbed the apple coleslaw for the mac and cheese. The ma and cheese tasted so much better than it looked. I always expect mac and cheese to look creamy and cheesy, but this looked almost dry when it came out. But, when we tasted it, we were totally wrong for judging it by its looks. It tasted rich and cheesy and was topped with parmesan breadcrumbs. 

Our entrees took a little longer than expected to come out, but we didn't even notice since we were having such a great time. The bartender who was serving us noticed this, and gave us a free dessert without us complaining or asking which we were very grateful for! We got the brownie sundae but ordered a half order of it since the whole thing normally comes with four brownies. Half of the portion was still too much! But it was amazing! Will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"So I ate here for lunch & it was my 1st trip to the place. If you are to head here, it seems better suited to be a dinner or late night visit.

First off, this place encompasses half a city block...well not really, but it is pretty huge. We decided to sit outside on the patio, but the inside looked huge, with a large bar, 2 pool tables, & several seating areas. The place wasn't too packed, but it was after the lunch crowd hour so I'm sure we caught it at a light time.

As for the menu, while very good, it's just a little heavy for a lunch menu. Maybe I ordered something a little too filling, but from what I saw on the menu, everything was more suited to the dinner crowd. If they had lunch portions, then I think this could make it a little better place to grab lunch. The food was great though & I'd definitely consider going back for dinner next time.

The one thing I regret not doing was ordering one of their beers. I've heard how good some of them are & was planning on ordering a pint, but my meal was too filiing & I couldn't see myself downing anything else.

I'll be back for dinner here next time, & remember to order my beer before I eat my meal."}
{"text":"I really should rate this a 1, but the brisket pizza was really good, so I'm being generous.   Unfortunately, it (the pizza) arrived 15 minutes after the rest of our food because of waiter error.   Which we would normally excuse, but there were just too many problems with our lunch.  Clearly it was a bad day...tables near us stacked with dirty dishes for our entire visit.  The restaurant was not busy.  Our food took at least 30 minutes to arrive the first time (and there was an error. )     Why a burger and a salad would take that long on a slow day is beyond me.  The worst offense was my chicken Caesar salad, which had about 1 or 2 ounces of chicken on it.  I can safely say that there was substantially less than 1/4 of a chicken breast on this salad.  The chicken was supposed to be grilled.  It might have been, but it was NOT grilled for me...it had definitely been in the refrigerator.  Flavor was fine, caesar dressing was good.   Fries with burger were luke warm.  Let's just say the restaurant almost lived up to its name...the pizza was its saving grace.  As late as it was, there was no offer to comp the pizza.  We decided to not be jerks so we didn't insist.  And the waiter seemed like a nice guy.   But obviously we have no plans to go back."}
{"text":"I've started preferring Rock Bottom on Game Days.  Their staff is much nicer than a lot of places.  Because they are also a restaurant, I feel their food quality and options are much better than some of the other bars in the area.  They have all the games on and the TV's are marked (at least for the first games) so you can figure out where you want to sit.  They will have the sound on for Panthers games, but not sure how they decide what to audio if they aren't.  They are very accommodating.

Rock Bottom is a little further down the street than some other bars/options, which is actually nice for me, because it doesn't get as packed as quickly nor does it get as rowdy.  

I don't have kids, but I feel if you want to come in with your family to watch the game you wouldn't have to worry about younger kids a lot of adult craziness.

They do have a patio in the very back past the bathrooms, but I've never sat out there and not sure if there are TV's out there or not."}
{"text":"Beer is a bit different as they have some coffee infused options. Food is pretty good. I liked the am burger the most. Something about eggs and hashbrowns in a burger that did it for me haha."}
{"text":"Tried Rock Bottom tonight before a movie and I thought it was ok.
I had the Lemon Grilled Chicken with Mashed Potatoes and Asparagus.  Everything was very yumm, but Rock Bottom just didn't make enough of an impression on me. If I was obsessed with beer maybe it would have gone over better. Restaurant ambiance and menu were very typical and neither were impressive. However my crazy friend Megan ordered Buffalo Fajitas, yes real buffalo steak, so that was a cool menu option. 
Now I can add Buffalo to the list of crazy things Ann Marie has eaten.

p.s Buffalo tastes a lot like steak."}
{"text":"I came here to take my mom out for Mother's Day/her birthday and service was absolutely horrible. It took about 10 minutes for someone to come over. We never got a beer menu when we got sat so the waiter had to bring us one. My mom sampled a beer and told the waiter she didn't want to get it. He brought out a pint and she told him she didn't want it. Then he never came back, kept passing us at least 5 times. Our food came out and he never acknowledged us. I got fish and chips and she got the lobster and shrimp enchiladas which came out and was so small! Did not taste any lobster in it either. Fish and chips were good. She had a birthday meal and he offered a free dessert which we got salted caramel cheesecake. I'm from out of town and have been here previously and have had much better service in the bar area."}
{"text":"Rock Bottom continues to earn it's name. I have been to this location on 5 separate occasions because my partner likes the beer varieties and the Pretzels. He has stopped telling me we are headed here because I will get them to change their mind before we arrive. After this last visit I told them that there are no more redeeming factors for me at this restaurant and I am not returning.

Chicken Oscar ~ belongs right in the trash with its muppet fur of shredded canned crab meat stuffed inside. Special of the night? It was a disaster and took forever to prepare. When I got it the chicken was dry and burnt all on the bottom. I could easily split the chicken open and see that the stuffing was a light smear of obvious canned shredded clam. The asparagus was hard and over buttered and the mashed potatoes were heavy and uninspired. It took so long and I couldn't get the waitstaff attention to bother returning it or thinking of more food to try. 
My partner had a burger, it was nothing special. The good part of that meal were the kettle chips, really! They were awesome.
We enjoyed our pretzels very much.
We didn't stay for dessert, we've had problems with three of their desserts in the past and we weren't going to try them again.
Service and wait staff were slow and uninterested, it's July and it must suck to work there with it mostly empty, I know servers make crap, so I left a fair tip, but I'm done. 

In this economic climate, either get good at what you do or go away. There are better places to eat. Tons of them."}
{"text":"When I first moved to uptown I loved this place but it has gone downhill drastically. Every time I come it's something new. Slow service. Food comes out wrong. Today I placed a to go order, walked down in the rain and they tell me it was never rung in. Disappointed."}
{"text":"The beer sampler was great. All of them were great craft beers. Wait staff had some good recommendations. I had the fish and chips, and they were very good. Would recommend if your looking for a restaurant downtown."}
{"text":"Had great service here but the food was nothing special & the atmosphere wasn't either. Unless you are drinking beer & watching sports there really is no reason to be here."}
{"text":"When I tell you I will not be returning to Rock Bottom.....everything was horrible and the manager sucked ass.....chicken was completely raw and cold.......pastas was dry noodles stuck together and nothing was actually done about it......sad thing is it was a party of 13 for a bday dinner and everyone hated their meals......they was vacuuming right at our table while we were eating...THIS SHIT WAS COMPLETELY SAD"}
{"text":"The chef messed up with our orders 4 times in a row and made me and my family wait more than two hours on our food. In the end they never gave us any service to help us out and all they did was give us salad and food that was supposed to be for other people. I give them a horrible review because I am disgusted that they couldn't even cook a decent chicken sandwich"}
{"text":"Whatever marketing genius came up with the name \"Rock Bottom\" probably had no idea how accurately it would describe this restaurant. Service- Rock Bottom. Food- Rock Bottom. This was one of the few places in the waterfront that accepted reservations, so we made reservations here before the comedy show at the Improv. I think this is one of the few places that takes reservations because they'll do anything to ensure a soul will walk in there and spend money. Our server started with a bang. Energetic. Nice personality. I guess he didnt realize that you actually have to check back on your table throughout the dining experience. Im still waiting on a refill. Most people will still consider it a \"positive experience\" if the wait for the food is long but the server updates you along the way. My updates on my food that was taking too long- Rock Bottom. Thank goodness we could leave there and go laugh and forget about this Rock Bottom experience. (Once too many?)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Arrived for our first visit to Charlotte on a Sunday evening. Had not eaten all day, so we searched Yelp for a pub and grub close to where we were staying. Saw Rock Bottom didn't have great reviews, but decided to try it anyway as their menu looked great.  
1st disappointment - As soon as we walked in, we were informed that they were only serving from their 'late night' very abbreviated menu that started at 8pm. Since we were hungry and didn't have a plan 'B' location, we got seated. 
2nd disappointment - We didn't get exactly what we ordered. We ordered the chicken nachos with an additional item of guacamole. When nachos came out...no guacamole!  Never saw waitress again until nachos were gone. I told her that our nachos didn't have the guacamole we ordered and she blamed the kitchen 'for having a bad night'!
3rd disappointment - We got the bill and noticed that the beers were charged more than the menu price and the nachos were charged extra for the chicken.  In the menu under nachos, it says choose chicken, beef, or guacamole for $5. Next line reads Add additional items for $1. Our waitress explained that it may be confusing, but the chicken, beef, or guacamole is EXTRA?!?!?  WHAT?!?!?!?!?!?
So I guess all the poor yelp reviews are true with this one!  It was a terrible experience and our first impression of Charlotte was not good."}
{"text":"Meh is the only thing I leave here feeling.  I ordered the classic burger because nothing on the new menu excited me.  For a side,  I requested the seasonal veggies (trying to be healthier) and was told it's a squash mixture - great I love summer squash!  

I received a poorly seasoned burger. The bun had the most flavor which is a sad statement.  It was topped with an olive and a mini pickle... odd.  My \"squash\" side was lacking squash. Instead all squash was replaced by peppers... which I cannot eat.

Our server was nice.  The beer was simple.  With new breweries and restaurants popping up in and around Homestead, perhaps RB should reconsider their flavors."}
{"text":"So I have not been to one of these in awhile since I normally have an aversion to chain restaurants, but since I was with colleagues on travel for work and they chose this place I went along. 

First surprise: decent beer.  I remembered the normal RB Brewery beers were not much to write home about but they had a couple of new styles, including a very good imperial IPA that for $5/glass cannot be beat.  Second surprise: pretty tasty food with a lot more healthy options than I expected.  Recommend the summer salad and the ahi tuna - both were great. 

Service was a little slow (not sure why) so a 4-star review is downgraded to 3.5. I'll be back next time I'm in Pittsburgh for work."}
{"text":"Good, fresh food and appetizers. Was sort of bummed to see this was a chain restaurant as they try to portray the feel of a local. Either way you can't deny the good atmosphere, good food, and reasonably priced drinks."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, but have finally stumbled upon my new favorite dish....the classic mac n' chicken. It is the perfect combination of cheese, noodles and protein. It has become my go-to mac and cheese whenever I have hankering for it. 

Some of my other favorites on the menu....

Jalapeno pretzel stix
Southwest egg rolls
Southwest bbq chicken salad
Chicken tortilla soup
Brewer's club sandwich

If you are a beer drinker, their beers are pretty good. I am more into wine, and they have a pretty decent wine selection. Their sangria is awesome as well.

Service is usually hit or miss in the dining area, but always pretty good in the bar area."}
{"text":"Ordered a Santa Fe grilled chicken salad and only got one quarter of a piece chicken and a few pieces of avacodos. Meal took a while and place wasn't busy. They took off 3 dollars for lack of chicken but still paid $9 dollars for mostly lettuce."}
{"text":"First, let's establish ethos. I've been living in the Pacific Northwest for the last five years and haven't wasted a second enjoying the world renown beer scene (e.g. Ninkasi, Deschutes, Rogue, etc.) so believe me when I say that I know a good beer when I taste one. 

I was blown away by the this location of Rock Bottom. I wasn't expecting to find this quality of local beer in Phoenix. I had the Coffee IPA, Wicked Elf Ale, and the Hefeweizen. All three were fantastic. In particular, I have to compliment the brewmaster, Jeff, for his skill in brewing Belgian style beers. The Wicked Elf and Hefe were on point. 

Next, the service was great. Our two bartenders, Bryan and Ryan, were super friendly and attentive despite the packed bar. 

10/10 I would strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The beer is good but the food is nothing to brag about at ALL. I've tried many things on the menu, and if you have developed a \"foodie\" palate, don't even bother, because you will be very disappointed. If you feel comfortable with chain restaurants and their lack of innovative touch (which, nothing wrong with that!) you will most likely enjoy Rockbottom. The only entree I did enjoy were the lobster and shrimp enchiladas (minus the repulsive beans and rice) and the asiago crab dip as an appetizer. Otherwise, you are better off skipping it."}
{"text":"Not the greatest ale house in the city but certainly not the worst.

I like the food and I have tried all the beers.  They're just \"OK\" as far as beer goes.

Large portions. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Im giving this 5 stars because at this location and at the time we went, it was great.  Amber I believe was our waitress and she couldn't have been more welcoming.  We went for an early lunch on a Sunday and it was only three of us.  

My girlfriend and I split their Kobe beef burger and while she likes the burgers near mooing.. Im more of a medium person.  She won, and the burger was mooing.  Let me tell you though.. it was delicious!  Their fries were good and crunchy and before hand we all had Caesar salads that just fit perfect.

Loved this place and we're thinking of making it a regular for weekend lunches!"}
{"text":"I went to Rock Bottom with a handful of friends to celebrate a birthday. There is so much potential for this restaurant to look cool, but I could not help but wonder if the inside used to be a Perkins or a nursing home they took over. Very bizarre. The bar area looks well designed but the restaurant seating is very Eat and Parkish. Yikes. 

Once ordered. The. Food. Took. For. Ev. Er. The restaurant is big, it was not full, and I'm still wondering what happened and why it took so long. I ordered a burger with an upgraded side of mac and cheese. I just wasn't impressed. I was starving and still didn't think it tasted that great. The whole meal didn't have a lot of flavor. 

Sorry to be a negative Nancy. Here's a plus! Plenty of parking. 

I won't be back. Sadly, after leaving, I wasn't doubting I truly just visited Rock Bottom. 

*I actually emailed the restaurant via the comment and never received a response. #ouch"}
{"text":"I usually avoid chain restaurants, but Rock Bottom is pretty consistently good everywhere I go. I was in Phoenix for a week and the Arrowhead location was a short walk from my hotel, so I ended up hanging out there a few times. The staff was friendly, and the food and brews were tasty. It was nice to have a go-to place when I was too tired or too lazy to look for something else, but even when I went out to other places, I didn't feel the service was as good as I got at Rock Bottom. One guy in particular, Jason, remembered my name on my second visit, which made me feel right at home."}
{"text":"I loved this place! I will be back! im a fan of beer and all different kinds of beer so this is my kinda place."}
{"text":"Rock Bottom Brewery has a great location and huge space, including bar area and indoor/outdoor seating. I've been a few times for lunch during the week and twice for dinner. It gets pretty busy at lunch time so try to arrive a little before noon or around 12:45pm in order to beat the lunch crowd rush. I've not had a problem getting a seat for dinner. And I've always had great service. 

The menu is huge (literally) with tons to choose from in terms of beverages and food. The fish tacos are good and the chicken picatta was okay but I found myself scraping off the extra sauce, and the green beans that came with it were overdone and soggy. I did enjoy the french fries. 

Where Rock Bottom falls slightly short is the prices. They're frankly too high for this type of establishment (in my mind it's similar to Applebee's or Outback). And as always, parking is a little tough uptown. Ultimately, if you're looking for somewhere to go and the other uptown restaurants are packed, Rock Bottom is a solid choice. Just don't expect to be overwhelmed."}
{"text":"The food is decent but the service was terrible. Our waitress didn't bring us silverware until 5 minutes after receiving our food. She also took 15 min to bring us the water we ordered when we sat down. I would not return to this place."}
{"text":"Nice place!  Great atmosphere.  I had a flight to taste all their own brew!  All their own brews were awesome!  Me and my husband shared the flight.  Awesome!  Five years ago we would have had one of each!  We don't drink many beers any longer.  This was a definite treat!  Will be back."}
{"text":"Last night I stopped by Rock Bottom with some friends for a late dinner & drinks. I ordered the fish & chips. I love fish & chips and this was the first time I had seen Salmon instead of white fish. The menu described it as Ale-battered, alder-smoked salmon served with fries, Brewery slaw, malt vinegar and homemade remoulade sauce... All I know is that it was yummy.

I also had the DreamWeaver Wheat Ale. Both selections were very good - the fish had a great taste - nicely crisp on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside. Good fries and a satisfying beer. My friends split some type of steak dish with vegetables. Both commented on how good it was. 

Finish off with a small dessert - they had this little mini chocolate peanut butter cookie thing for $2.50. Small, but good.

The dining area was spacious - I have bad seating karma. I am a big dude and for some reason they love to sit me in the smallest places. Three of us were put at a bar table in the bar, when there were open booths near by. At least I got to see the football game. What surprised me was that on a Friday night, it wasn't very busy. Soon after we arrived, other booths cleared out, the bar was down to two gus at opposite ends - not what I would expect for a brewery on Friday night. Maybe they should have more happy hour specials and get people to come out?

Good food, good beer and the server was excellent. The atmosphere a little dead."}
{"text":"Went here for late lunch. Service was prompt. Drinks, brewery beer, was great. Food came quickly and was hot. Great taste and just enough. Will go back again. Very clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"Great place! Awesome dual setting piano! Brewery too! And good food! All in one place!"}
{"text":"I think the food here is pretty good.  I don't drink so I can't say anything for the beer. It can be pricey, so I use restaurant.com coupons, saves A LOT!
The service has been wonderful every time I go.  I have been about 8 times. I always end up tipping 30% or more because the service is that good.  Give it a shot."}
{"text":"The only reason Rock Bottom gets 3 stars is because of the brews. Food was \"eh\", not many vegetarian options and hostesses who will ignore you because they are too busy chatting about who didn't text them back. This place has the potential to be great, but sadly, it falls way too short in almost all areas."}
{"text":"I was SO ready to like this place!  Turns out, not so much.  It was okay.  No better than TGIFridays, but better than Eat n Park!  The deets.

The hubster and I were here on a Saturday evening after a show at the Improv so we were happy and in a good mood and ready to enjoy some good eats.  We ordered drinks.  He a wheat beer of their brewing, me my fave Bloody Mary with Absolut Peppar.  The hubster deemed the beer acceptable, but wouldn't go out of his way to come back just for another one....yes, he DID order another one \"just to be sure.\"  My Bloody sucked.  Watered down tomato juice with no discernible Peppar of any kind, let alone any other seasonings.  Even a good standard mix would have been better.  Our very efficient and friendly waitress took it back and watched while it was remade by the other bartender.  Nope, no better at all.  That went back and I went with a you-can't-screw-it-up Amaretto sour.  It was fine.

Hub ordered a Reuben - why, I'll never know because they simply never measure up to the gold standard of what used to be at the long-lamented Gazebo in Shadyside.  You younguns wouldn't have a clue of the establishment of which I speak.  He said this one was \"fine.\"  I had the Texas Fire steak with jalapeno butter which I enjoyed very much!  Packed a punch of heat and flavor, but the sides were uninspired.  Steamed veggies.  Any flavor was steamed out in the process - eh.  Cheddar mashed potatoes - there was cheddar in there?????  No way!

The tab was reasonable - we DID have a Living Social deal that took $30 off, so our check was for $12 and change, not including tip.  Not bad (even with the $15 cost of the LS Deal), but had we paid full price, it wouldn't have been worth the experience.  We'll hit the Improv again - we have before - but, we'll head somewhere else afterwards."}
{"text":"I love this restaraunt. Rarely have I ever received service like I get here. The food is good, definitely reasonable for the price. The thing that blew me away was the fact that my steak was cooked TO TEMPERATURE. This rarely ever happens at restaraunt of similar price range and quality. But the servers are fantastic. Very attentive, polite and timely. The beer selection is awesome, we always order the sampler. I like having lots of options as far as beverages go. The wait time isn't terrible if you go a little later on a friday or Saturday night. And they most often call you before the quotes time. The desert menu is a little small, but I could probably skip it anyways ;)  the ambiance is good, not to crammed or noisy. They also have outside seating available when the weather is nice I highly recommend this establishment!"}
{"text":"Went for my third time in 9 months.  We've always come here for lunch/afternoon food, so I can't say much about the dinner menu, but we've had great experiences each time.  

Today we got the guac sampler and the fish tacos.  We were undecided on a couple of brews, and the bartender comped us some generous samples.  The guac sampler (spicy pepper, mango, and pineapple) came with housemade chips which were a standout (not too oily, just the right amount of crispness), and the fish tacos were tasty but ordinary.  We've also enjoyed the cheese and pretzel app.

But the 4 stars are definitely for the beers.  RB has a great selection of affordable beers in a variety of styles.  Little-known fact--they actually offer a beer sampler where you can try the 10-12 brews they have, and it's something like $7 for 3-4 ounce pours of each. It's not on the menu, but the servers told us about it on our first and second visits. BEST DEAL EVER. Even if you only like half of them, you're way ahead of most bars on the price per ounce.  (The only better deal is when the bartender comps you the samples).

Good food, great beer, great service--a fabulous way to do dinner & a movie!"}
{"text":"We came here for a late lunch, me and my soon to be wife. Got sat right away, drink order in and food ordered. They have a great brewed beer there at a reasonable price as well. Servers were attentive and friendly. Food was great. The fish tacos were good flavor and not overly done with cabbage like in other restaurants I've been to. Definitely going back when I'm the area."}
{"text":"Good food but really nothing special. I ordered a salad and the apple chips on top were stale. We come here so that my husband can get the beer. The waitress was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Nice enough chain restaurant.  Have ordered the fish tacos appetizer and the dinner entree of cajun fish tacos which comes with black beans and rice.  Both are ok, though I think I'd order something else next time as I'm pretty picky about fish tacos.  

The appetizer tacos were rather dry.  The cajun tacos were much better but executed oddly.  They come in 2 shells -- an inner hard shell and an outer soft shell.  Why might I ask?  Why add extra calories for something that seems so unnecessary and doesn't add to the dish in any way.  

Oh, well.  Can't speak about beer here as I'm not a beer drinker.

The space is pleasant and our server was efficient even if the meal wasn't the quickest to come to our table even though it wasn't busy.

Would I revisit?  Probably; it was decent enough with many other menu options.  Keep in mind, however, that there are many options nearby worthy of a visit."}
{"text":"Service is great. Outside seating in mild weather is awesome. Chicken Mac and Sausage Mac were both great. Veggie pizza was fresh and yummy. Beer sampler was fun to try!"}
{"text":"Was in a taco mood when I went here with friends so, tried the veggie tacos.  

These tacos were all lettuce with a splash of roasted veggies as garnish.  It was kind of funny and sad at the same time.  Oh well, now I know to just visit for the overpriced beer and now the overpriced food. 

On the plus side, the server was nice."}
{"text":"I called and asked if they had a gluten free menu, they said that they had one. We arrived, we were sat and given our menus. It was NOT a gluten free menu at all! It was a menu with a very small selection of items on their normal menu with the gluten taken again. No substitute were given. There were burgers with out any buns, salads without croutons, no fries, etc. Very disappointed with this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad.  If you live in Charlotte and have tried the other local beers in the area, check this place out.  If you're from out of town and want good local beer, I'd recommend somewhere else.  While the beer was good, it wasn't memorable.  The food was good, but again, nothing super memorable.  The waitress was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Rock Bottom really is not the bottom.  They do have an incredible location, right on Tryon Street.  If the weather is right, then the patio is nice, but can be a bit of a pain because of the traffic.  Nothing quite like sucking down some exhaust while you are trying to enjoy your meal.  Still it is nicer than someplace that has nothing, and uptown really does not have that much traffic most nights.

On the inside, the place borders on an upscale Applebees.  It is not that they are particularly nice or memorable, and that is the real issue here.  Because of the location and the opportunity, they have the potential to be so much more.

The one bright spot is the service - Steve-o-reeno helped us out when we hit up the place for a night out with some friends, and he definitely made an average visit into a fully enjoyable one.  If he is around, make sure you ask for him."}
{"text":"Me and a friend sat the bar to kill time before going to an event. Bartenders were really nice and helpful. They were really attentive too! Drinks were made just right and really refreshing. My friend wanted a white russian and they told her they didn't have all the ingredients so she got something else. They told her that her first drink was on them due to the issue. She was super pleased with that. 

We were a little hungry so we got a salsa stack. It's only $2 during happy hour. It's homemade chips with pico, beans, corn and fresh avocado. It was so good!! Chips were crispy. The salsa was very fresh and the avocado was perfect. It was the perfect little snack.

To top off our visit, we saw Muggsy Bogues there too!"}
{"text":"After reading all of the reviews it seemed like a good place to go for the first time, I was not satisfied with my meal nor the appetizer we got. The steak I ordered was mostly fat rather than meat. The service was great however I did not enjoy the food."}
{"text":"I have come to this brewery twice now. It is a convenient place to drop by uptown that is affordable and has a decent microbrew feel. There is a happy hour from 4-6:30, and they have a beer on special every day. I had the seasonal beer offered in the fall, Rocktoberfest and it was delicious! The food is equitable to an Applebee's so nothing fantastic there. I would agree with the previous reviews that state this is \"nothing special\"."}
{"text":"We stopped into Rock Bottom for a late dinner. The place was hopping-the bar side and the restaurant side. We chose to dine on the restaurant side. There were a lot of great choices on the menu. I chose the grilled chicken sandwich which had barbecue sauce, bacon, cheddar cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomatoes, and red onions. The chicken it self had a great grilled flavor. I think it was good enough to eat plain. The barbecue sauce was smokey with a hint of sweetness. The pickles added a tangyness. It was a huge sandwich. It was served with fries but they were a little soft. They needed a few more minutes of cooking. 
I only ate half of my sandwich so I would have room for dessert. They have a couple of smaller desserts that are served in Mason jars. Then they have a few that are larger that you could share with 2pr 3 people. I ordered the cheesecake with caramel and toffee. Yum!!!! It was the perfect ending to a good meal."}
{"text":"--Good variety of beers.

--Great location near Arrowhead Mall.

--Plenty of parking.

--Food was decent for chain food.

--Service was a tad slow, but the Server was friendly."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Ordered cherry glazed, hazelnut-crusted chicken. The vegs? They didn't overcook carrots! Yay! My teen ordered avocado chicken sandwich - it's BIG and avocado, were ripe and fresh! Nice service! Go. I almost died there... so was my teenager daughter (she was picky but she loved her order very much)."}
{"text":"Great bar type food. Loved the fries and chicken tenders. The restaurant is beautiful on the inside, and the staff is friendly! Our waiter had us cracking up!"}
{"text":"Came here once and fell in love with the beer!! Can't wait to go back and try some of the amazing items on the food menu."}
{"text":"I am really impressed with how Rock Bottom has added the calories next to every dish on their menu. It made me more mindful of what I was eating so I did not leave feeling bloated and too full. I wish there were some healthier options because I felt really limited after reading how many calories were in all of the entrees."}
{"text":"A restaurant that serves food AND only their crafted beer.

The food isn't too bad.  We had some pizza, it was cheap and good at happy hour prices.

The beer, well, it's drinkable.  They have about 8-10 types.  I stuck to the \"blonde\" flavor.  It's good and drinkable - the rest suck.

Come for the food and hard liquor - I think they have it.

But as for beer, and the current fad and craze of \"GOOD\" craft beers being offered up at every other bar in the world, go to another bar for the beer."}
{"text":"My experience can be summed up as entirely average. 

I'm not usually a big fan of chains I got a Groupon for this place some time ago and decided to finally use it.  We sat in the bar area, the atmosphere was as expected, sports TVs, decent brews. 

We ordered the firecracker shrimp and the sirloin steak, nothing spectacular but decent. The menu said they had a chimichurri sauce for the steak but our waitress had no idea about it. The food was served cold, might have been better had it been warm. 

I probably won't be back to Rock Bottom when there are so many other (non-chain) options"}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here for happy hour. They have great appetizer and drink specials. Their ballpark pretzels are so big and soft and the dip is delish. Last night we also got the buttermilk chicken tenders which were good and not too bready or greasy.  The pork street tacos were also great. We had a very filling dinner by just eating off the HH appetizer menu! We also have a mug club card, which is free to sign up for, and when you show it you get upgraded to a 22 oz beer at no extra charge. You also get other free stuff as you accumulate visits.  Last time we got a free pint glass. Their HH is from 4-7 Mon-Sat, so even if you come at dinnertime you can still get the HH special pricing, which I highly recommend."}
{"text":"For a chain, it is better atmosphere than you would expect.  The menu options all sound delicious, but the food quality is not great.  Just mediocre."}
{"text":"Good food and large portions. I ordered the Veggie Burger for $8.50 and I loved it! It's one of the most unique veggie burgers I have ever had: a homemade patty of beans, rolled oats and veggies. The chipotle mayo really gave it that oomph. My burger was more than enough for me to handle and everything was worth the price. As for drinks, I'm a complete noob when it comes to beer but my friend ordered a tap and even from a small taste, I could tell it was very good quality beer. Bitter and sweet, with a slight tang. I rarely drink beer but i I'm going to, then might as well drink the best kind there is - fresh and microbrewed.

NOTE: There aren't too many options for vegetarians. The veggie burger was pretty good and I'd recommend it, but other than that, there's also the veggie tacos, a few select appetizers, and a few salads from which to choose."}
{"text":"I went here with the boy on a Sunday afternoon, and it wasn't very busy.  We ordered a appetizer sampler, and it was huge (as it should be at $18!)  The appetizer took a really long time to arrive.  It had wings, nachos, some kind of Mexican roll-up thing, and a  huge soft-pretzel that was super good.  We ordered the chicken fried chicken and shared it.  We both took a bite and decided that it was entirely too salty.  The server asked how it was, and we told her that it wasn't so great.  She apologized and asked what she could do.  We told her that we were fine, but didn't eat another bite.  She brought us our ticket and included a free piece of carrot cake, since we didn't enjoy our entree.  The carrot cake did make up for it all.  It was huge piece and had caramel sauce drizzled on it.  I usually don't like carrot cake, but this was really good!  The place was ok, but the service was super slow."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch based on the Yelp reviews. We sat in the bar and the server was awesome - forgot his name. I had the Mac and cheese and the portion was enough for 3 people. It was super yummy. My husband had the Cheddar Smash burger and he said it was one of the 3 top burgers he has ever had. Beer was great too."}
{"text":"I try to stay away from the chain restaurants, but I was shopping at Target(for the bargain) and came down with an unexpectant hunger headache.  Very close by was this Rock Bottom...I like beer so what the heck.  I came during happy hour and the prices were great.  Had a hefeweizen and buffalo chiken strips.  Both three bucks, beer was very good, food not so bad.  Headache gone in few minutes no time.  I give it four stars because of the service.  I know what it takes to give great service and I expect the best every time."}
{"text":"Stopped in here recently on a Sunday to watch some football in the bar area. Really great food and drink deals during the games. Service was good. Beer selection is excellent.

The only complaint was their street tacos which are served cold. We were given a complimentary, yummy guacamole appetizer after we let the waitress know it was not what we were expecting or used to being served. Won't order the tacos again but will go back for everything else."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a pre-Labor Day weekend lunch. The food was okay, the service was okay...alright we actually really like their beer and really went here because of it. The restroom has seen better days. I am a very slight person and found it difficult to get out of the stall once I got in. The door opened inward and I had to step to the side of the toilet to get through it. I might stop here again since it's near my office but I prefer the atmosphere at the Desert Ridge location."}
{"text":"Greasy Bottom and Stony Service. I had never been to any of these chains. We had some time to kill so we popped in. The high top was so out of balance we moved ourselves. The menus felt so grimy I washed my hands after ordering. The server was high on weed which is preferable to her being high on tweak but still. The beer was cold and quite good. We ordered nachos. They are HUGE. but they are greasy. I felt gross after eating them so I didn't order anything else. My husband ordered wings. He said they were good. The server and her backup were very cool about bringing beer samples, that we hadn't even asked for. That was a fun and gracious surprise. I can't say I'll go back. There are just too many other places w cold beer and better food."}
{"text":"We went here during a family vacation. We wanted to take our dad out for his b-day and thought this would be a fun place to grab some beer and eats while still able to take my young nephews.  

We made reservations cause there was 8 of us. We were seated right away. Our table actually had a reserved sign on it when we were seated. Makes ya feel kind of special. :) 

What I got to drink:

Rock Bottom White Ale - Brewed with two-row malted barley and wheat, with a hint of orange peel and coriander. The beer was quite refreshing especially being in the hot Arizona sun all day long. 

What I got to eat:

Tillamook Bacon Burger - Steakburger topped with Tillamook cheddar cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato and finished with BBQ jalapeño ranch dressing. This burger was so juicy. They use a brioche bun that soaked up all the yummy juices. Got to go on the list of the some of the best burgers I've had. 

I whispered to the waiter that it was my dads bday and he brought out a decent sized chocolate cupcake with an gooey frosting that everyone at the table gobbled up pretty quickly. 

Me and my brother split the bill. With 6 adults and two kids we got out of there for a 118 bucks including a decent tip from the both of us. It was a great experience. I'll have to see if there is a local RBB in my area."}
{"text":"The red ale was really great.   Attentive staff and friendly environment.   I recommend the Reuben.  Their location brings in a lot of tourists."}
{"text":"Standard brewery/pub restaurant. I wasn't impressed with the vegetarian selection, but that I expect that at this type of restaurant. Their beer is pretty good, and a waiter came around with complimentary samples of their seasonal beers. We ordered the nachos, and they weren't anything special.

The best part about this place is that we were able to be seated immediately on a Friday night. We went out last minute and had tried multiple restaurants that had waits from 30 minutes to two hours. But, we walked right into Rock Bottom and got seated and waited on promptly. Great service"}
{"text":"This place has kind of a cool vibe. The beer was fantastic. The food was so good and cooked to order. The menu has so many great selections. My husband ordered the mac&cheese with chicken. I didn't try any of it but it looked so decadent and he practically licked the bowI! I had a burger with pepper jack cheese, house pickled onions, chipotle mayo, avocado...it was cooked to a perfect medium rare with just the right amount of char and juicy in the middle. A few improvements could be to attend to the rest rooms more frequently. They needed some tidying up, the paper towel dispenser was not working, and some stalls needed toilet paper. The service was good and friendly but could be a bit more attentive. I think if this place could get a bit more polished it would earn another star!"}
{"text":"I came to Rock Bottom for a late lunch on Saturday afternoon. This was my first time here and I have heard pretty good things about it. We had a party of 12 and they were very accommodating. They sat us comfortably at two large tables pushed together. 

Our server was very friendly and prompt in getting us our drinks and taking our food orders. I decided to go with the two shrimp and lobster tacos. They come with Mexican rice and beans, but I am not the biggest bean person. The server was awesome about letting me sub French fries for the beans instead! 

For the tacos- they were OK. Not bad but nothing great either. They were supposed to be shrimp AND lobster, but I was really disappointed to find only about 1-2 VERY small pieces of lobster on each taco. Being mostly shrimp, I do not think the taco was worth the $13.50. The shells were pretty different as well. It was a hard shell taco with a soft shell on the outside. I think they would be better with just the soft shell. 2 types of shell just adds extra calories and no extra flavor really. Another thing I thought was odd was that they come with lettuce inside instead of the usual shredded cabbage. They were decent, but again without the lobster it was not worth the money. The rice and French fries were very tasty, however! 

Over half of the party ordered the mac & cheese, which I tried and it was really good! It came with bacon, chicken, and a few other things that I cannot remember, but next time I go I think that is what I will order. 

Oh! Also a person at our table ordered the jalapeño pretzel sticks with some sort of warm dip and they were to DIE FOR. The dough was so warm and fresh I could not stop eating her appetizer lol. Definitely a must for next time as well. 

Overall it was a good experience! They had the food out in a very timely manner given the size of our party. Again disappointed by the tacos, but everything else was good."}
{"text":"Rock Bottom has a sizable menu with all things one would expect at a brew pub that is a full service restaurant. The number of Mexican cuisine offerings seems to be growing. The food seems to be reliably good.It's also excellent for groups! I've been there several times with groups. While the most recent time was only seven, some in the past have been large groups (one of 20, and another with over 30) on weekend evenings and I'm thoroughly impressed with the friendly, efficient and professional manner in which the accommodate groups. Whether increasing the number of diners at the last minute or providing separate checks, they are flawless. Lots of other restaurants could learn from them. Impressively, even with providing separate checks to such large groups, they've always chose not to add gratuity (and we obliged with good tips), They also managed to deliver food to everyone at the same time, and processed payment of the checks in no time at all. Bravo to this restaurant's management and service staff, it's top notch. My only complaints are related to the beer -- both the taste and attempting to choose one. Choosing one was difficult as the large menu chalkboard didn't have ABVs listed on it  , the beer on cask condition was not the one listed on the menu board and there was at least one other discrepancy between the beer list on the table and the menu board. And what's listed on the restaurant's website for this location isn't even close. In addition, the server was not able to answer a fairly simple question about one of the beers (but she went and asked a bartender), which was surprising for a brew pub, but it should be noted that otherwise, the service was flawless. I wasn't impressed with the two beers that I tried (and I'm not remotely a beer snob).The Good Neighbor Kölsch wasn't as smooth as I'm used to getting from any Kölsch, including ones that I've had here in the past. The Life's A Peach wheat with mango and peach had a bit of a bite to it as well."}
{"text":"First off, I will say that I just moved here from California and was a big patron at the Rockbottom in Long Beach. I came to the Homestead location last night eager to see the beer at this location.

Now, Rockbottom is a chain brewery, so a lot was the same... the menu, the food prices (yet beer is cheaper, and I am fine with that). I have always found their food to be pricey, but they use excellent ingredients and it has always been tasty and filling so I am fine with that. The food here was just as good as the Long Beach location, so I have no problem with the chef at all.

Service was good, our waitress was very friendly and helpful. I wish that they had asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar since happy hour was still going, but that isn't a big thing. Went to the bar to get a drink and had to wait awhile to get the bartender's attention, but he was very friendly and I got a nice welcome from him and others at the bar when they learned I had just moved here... I really enjoyed that.

Beer: We got the beer sampler to try the whole list... and, well... I found the dark beers a bit lacking in comparison. The light beer and the wheat were amazing, very impressed. The pale was ok, as was the velvet pale that was one of the specials of the night... but both were way too citrusy. The Uppity IPA was very good... I don't usually like IPAs because the hops overpowers all flavor but the brewer had a good balance. Still, couldn't do a whole glass. I felt the Imperial Stout had a bitter burned taste that was overpowering... I almost want to say the batch had too much chocolate malt in it (not ice cream malt, for the non-homebrewers). The brown and amber were decent, but bland. I ended up getting an actual glass of the light beer and was able to finish it all without forcing it.... one point up on Long Beach, who had a good light but the aftertaste got to you before the glass was empty.

I REALLY wanted to try the Das Gut Dopplebock, but they were out. Looks like they will have it in bottles to go soon so I hope I can catch that. Also want to try the Snow Moon Belgian.

Verdict: While I was not too impressed with the dark beers, I found the lighter ones very good and I look forward to trying the other seasonal beers. It is a good hour drive south to get there, so I won't be going too often, but I will be back."}
{"text":"We sat on the patio.  The chairs were filthy (food, dirt, bird poop?) and there are ashtrays all over filled with old butts at 4 pm. Only 2 other people on the patio and no one was smoking.  Service was okay but not great.  Couldn't get a frozen margarita because the waiter said they didn't have a blender. Margaritas are made from a common mix so don't bother.  We ordered nachos and they tasted good.  They were served warm, but not hot.   There was plenty and the salsa was pretty good but not hot.  Guac was just avocados chopped up. We had never been there, though we live in the area.  Won't be going back.  It was just pretty disappointing across the board."}
{"text":"I've had it with this place, giving them the 1-star they deserve for their utterly and completely crap service that I have endured for the last year or so, almost entirely without fail. I look back at my original review and wonder what the hell went wrong, but at this point I don't even care what the answer is, I'm just laying it out and leaving this mess behind me. 

Service, service, service, that is the problem at this location and has been for a long, long time. Ever since my original review back in 2011, service has been a problem and no amount of effort on my part has been able to make even a measurable dent in the problem. I spoke to the manager, general manager and even regional manager about my concerns and the repeated bad service experiences I was having, all of this many, many months ago, and NOTHING has changed since then. 

I swore off this place for a long time, going only very rarely (once every few months) and then not at all for a long time. Tonight, I fell off the wagon and gave them another shot, but was once again starkly reminded of why I had strayed in the first place: their service sucks. 

Tonight's visit was so absolutely typical that it was almost laughable. First, upon walking through the door during a slow period just about 5pm on a Wednesday night, we are greeted by the sight of a restaurant only 1/3 occupied and the hostess is on the phone at the podium. Does she look up to acknowledge our existence? Nope. Gesture to suggest it'll be just a second? Nope. Put the person on the phone on hold to seat paying, on-site customers or at least greet them? Nope. Instead, we stand there like idiots for the better part of 5 minutes while she completes the call. Then and only then are we good enough to be acknowledged with an utterly insincere \"Sorry about that,\" and it was business as usual.

You have to understand that hostesses being asleep at the wheel is par for the course at this location. I cannot count how many times I've walked in and there isn't even anyone standing there to seat customers. I have literally had to stand there until some hapless server or the hostess who was busy folding napkins in the banquet room (no lie) finally noticed that customers had walked in the door and, God forbid, were expecting to be seated sometime this evening. This is one of those issues I complained up through three levels of management about REPEATEDLY and, as tonight's performance indicates, nothing has changed at all. 

But hey, why stop there? So we got a booth and our server eventually shows up to take the drink orders and an appetizer order once the drinks arrive, but then she disappears. Other booths are visited multiple times, right next to us, but we don't see her again until the appetizer comes out. Half way through the appetizer we run low on drinks, as in sipping through the straw to get attention, empty glass on the corner of the table in plain sight, begging for a refill. Yeah, that low on drinks. She finally shows up, notices we've been deprived of our refills and says she'll bring refills (which she did) but didn't apologize. That wouldn't be so bad, except it happened TWICE more. You would think an inattentive server would try to make up for the first screw up by being quicker to refill the drinks or making more frequent visits thereafter, but nope, not a chance. She disappeared again and it was more of the same. 

I understand this type of thing when the place is packed, but tonight, as has always been the case when I get crap service at this location, the restaurant was 2/3rds empty, so there's simply no excuse for it, and certainly no excuse for being 100% unapologetic about it. I mean at least comp the drinks off out of courtesy after the second time you leave the customer thirsty. 

The true shame is that their food is really good. I love the mac and cheese and my wife is a huge fan of the burgers and the steaks. We even enjoyed the appetizer. It just really stings that with the prices they charge, they can't seem to get even the basics like hosting and drink service that are on par with the rest of the civilized restaurant world. As I told the management, repeatedly at that, no other restaurant I have ever been at has been so consistent in providing shoddy service, especially the hosting and drinks. Is it really so hard to get something so simple right? 

I'm sorry, but at this point I give up. I kept giving fifth and sixth and tenth chances to this place, took almost a year off from visiting and return to find the same problems that there had always been, hand in hand with the otherwise excellent food that they've always had. It's an absolute and utter shame, but when talking to even the regional manager still won't fix these simple problems, what can you do except take your business somewhere else? Just unbelievable."}
{"text":"First I want to say that I normally don't yelp bad comments, only because I am the GM of one of the top yelped restaurants in the country. I know the power of yelp but I was so disappointed in the service at this location, I couldn't not say something. First off there was a good 6 employees hovering the host stand, one of which had their back to the front door. When they sat us they stuck us in the darkest corner of the restaurant, tv not on, blinds broken, very dismal. We saw quite a few servers hovering over this one table in the bar which was frustrating because it took a long time to get a waitress to come over when she finally did she had a very unwelcoming attitude. She finally opened up a little when we were ordering our dinner. We came to town for the padres game and decided to come to your establishment for my sisters birthday, hoping for a fun time. We received our first round of drinks, when those came we ordered our food. By the time the food came we had been wanting to order another round  way prior but that didn't happen. Also, we ordered dinner salads, they came out with our burgers, honestly that was the most frustrating part!! When we got our food our server had been sat two larger tables so we were half way finished by the time we put our next round in, then waiting for that... wow!!! We were practically finished! The sad part is that we were pretty much her only table for the first half of the visit, if she had been busy I would have just gone with the slow service, I get it!!!!! Why the 2 stars and not 1, well their food is delicious!! 
By the end we just wanted to leave. One of the worst dining experiences I've had, very disappointing!! If I was the GM of the establishment, well I would be embarrassed!"}
{"text":"not thrilling, not disappointing.  RB is average across the board.  Try the Hazelnut Crusted Chicken."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to stop in for the first time today for lunch..... I can only review the service and cleanliness because we didn't stay long enough to eat. First off as we walked up and looked at the outside seating area we were very disappointed,  it was such a beautiful day out but sitting outside was not an option because it looked like it was not kept up at all. We went inside and we were seated right away because it was only 11:30 and only a few people were in the restaurant. We sat and looked at the menu for quite a while never did anyone come ask if we wanted anything to drink, not even water. In fact a waitress (the only one we saw) was helping a table 2 down from us and when she was done we thought for sure she would say hello or be right with you or something but NOPE nothing...... that's when we got up and walked out! Good service goes along way and we will not be back to this place!!"}
{"text":"Burger was just ok. The Waitress was awesome and deserves to work at a better establishment. She is the only reason that I added a star. We ordered within 5 minutes of being seated. The place was empty on Monday night and it took 50 mins for three burgers. The 2am burger was pretty boring And not worth the time and price even with hash browns and a fried egg. The fries were once frozen. I will never make the mistake to choose Rock Bottom over Freddy's ever again!"}
{"text":"Ate here the other night and would TOTALLY go back. Very spacious, awesome bar and outdoor seating available. I had the Hawaiin Chicken dish - you have to try this, it was incredible! They chicken was so juicy and cooked perfectly, with pineapple sauce on top and rice pilaf underneath. I am craving it again as I type this. It is also very cool to walk into a place and order your beer by saying \"red, ale, amber, port\" etc. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and the service is quick. They welcome you at the desk as if your a personal friend which is a nice touch for customer service . A great place for group meetings"}
{"text":"57 dollars for two steak meals and plenty of beer is not a bad price at all. Being in the center of downtown you would think there prices would be higher but they have some amazing choices and beers for a good price. I enjoyed there red ale more then there brown but both where great and my wife said that her kolsch was well made also. Ive been here several times and will be returning several more."}
{"text":"Came here 2 days in a row because RIRa didnt want our bar business.

The food and drinks here are great....and the wait staff is friendly.

We will be back"}
{"text":"Normally the food is outstanding, no more salted bread sticks, but they did bring back the ball park pretzels.  Not very good, cool to low warm. Hard, dense.  Mango ice tea is wonderful.

Will see how the chicken comes out.

To be continued..."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here since their kitchen is open late and it's a good option after movies. Their nachos is pretty good. I also tried their burger and chicken sandwiches and they're good as well. 
I think the only thing I did't like is the steak taco appetizer. It was too sour and kinda tasteless."}
{"text":"Had my happy hour here. Will definitely be doing it again! We both had the brewery's light colored beer--very good and refreshing. Maxwell Smart had the calamari and pepper rings. He was surprised they were actually jalapeno rings, but they were good since they were very mild. Calamari is one of his favorite foods and he really loved it. I had the ball park pretzels with the spicy cheese dip--went perfectly with the beer.  Comfortable, pleasant, fun place. Very good service."}
{"text":"We love this place and go there often... Until now! We made reservations for 10 + 2 high chairs. We ended up having 14 adults and said we could sit the kids on our laps. They refused to make accommodations for two extra seats because they were more concerned about future reservations they had after us. The manager had no solutions for us and we were forced to leave after 12 of us were already seated with drinks. Unless we are contacted by someone other than the terrible manager and his sidekick, we will never be back. We recommend you stay away if you're trying to book a large party. Hey, Rock Bottom PR, if you're reading this... The 14 of us spent over $1,000 on drinks and food at Arriba's right up the street."}
{"text":"I recently visited Charlotte this past weekend for the race and needed a casual good food experience. I reviewed Yelp but most of the Downtown spots were noted as dressy or trendy attire establishments. From a 5 hour ride most of us were just comfortable in jeans and tees so nothing to dapper. The concierge at the hotel recommended the Rock Bottom so we gave it a shot. The place was excellent with its open air styling and the drinks were on spot. We ordered the southwest eggrolls as a app and started to order another plate of them and then we remembered we had more food coming! They were that good. I ordered the 14 Ribye with bourbonzola topping. Couldnt have been a more delicious and tender piece of meat. . The seaon veggies and chedder mash were no second. Everything on my plate could not have been anybetter. Check it out . It was worth the visit. And the house brews seemed to hit the spot with the guys that were with me."}
{"text":"The food here is consistently off-the-charts good. The beers are also some of the best in the city (hello, marzipan-flavored wheat ale). Plus, it validates parking in Uptown. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Brian's beer is GREAT!!! And the food is AWESOME!!  Great patio seating to do some people watching.  Great for hanging out with friends, for families, for business, or for a mid-afternoon beer.  Ask for Tommy at the bar, he'll take great care of ya!"}
{"text":"I just came here with some friends to hang out and get some appetizer, and I have to admit that I was pretty satisfied with what we got.  Though I couldn't find any fried pickles or onion rings on the apps section, there were some blue cheese nachos that really hit the spot.  The atmosphere of this seems pretty cool, especially in the pub area."}
{"text":"I really miss the Northstar Amber but the specialty beers are always good.  Food is excellent and the service staff is friendly."}
{"text":"My husband loves this place so whenever we are in town we tend to stop by.  I really enjoy the atmosphere!  It's a great place to meet friends, have a family meal, or for date night.  I personally love the mixed drinks.  I have yet to hit a home run with their handcrafted beers but I will keep trying- I truly believe they have one for me on that menu somewhere!  Upon a recent visit I tried the Winter Tartan Scottish Ale but it was just a little too bitter for my tastes.  

The food is a different story.  I haven't had anything that was really memorable.  There was an awesome crab dip at one point but when I tried something similar on my latest visit, it was not the same taste.  Regardless of the food, we ALWAYS have a good time!"}
{"text":"We go here fairly often - food is good - it is somewhat quiet and good for families and the menu is extensive."}
{"text":"This place is quite big with a bar area, dining room area, and patio area. We decided to sit in the bar area so we could watch some football on one of the many TV's. They also have darts and two pool tables, which I really enjoy. When you are in the bar area you can see the beer being brewed through the window which is really cool. 

I ordered the hibiscus wheat beer and my friend ordered the white wheat, both of which are brewed by Rock Bottom. They both tasted delicious and were exactly what I needed for a hot day. My friend ordered the Fried chicken entree which came with mashed potatoes and of course she gave me a few bites since we always share. It was a pretty delicious meal, but the fried crust fell off a few pieces which I am not really a fan of. I ordered the Sante fe salad with grilled chicken not fried. The salad was okay I was expecting more flavors overall, but I didn't really get them. 

It was a good experience and will most likely be back when I am around the waterfront area."}
{"text":"I tend to go more for the independently owned breweries, but I enjoy Rock Bottom. As with any large chain, I suggest sticking to the seasonal beers made available, as they tend to have more character and depth than the standard fare offered every day. But your mileage may vary.

Looking for an appetizer? Go with the pretzels. You won't be disappointed. My wife is a fan of their Grilled Salmon Caesar salad. Me? I tend to pick whatever is on special. The \"fireman pizza\" (or whatever it was called) was rather uninspiring. 

All and all, a solid place for a good meal and brew."}
{"text":"Always like coming here once in awhile.  Sit at the bar, really good beer and food is above average for bar food with great selection.  Ryan serving at the bar is always spot on service and funny too!  Cozy place to hang out esp in the winter with cool fire pit in back too!  I really like the Wicked Elf and the Red beer, get you buzzed!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were spontaneously looking for a casual dinner last Saturday. Duckworth's Uptown was our first choice, but there was no hope of getting a table there with the college football crowd camping out, so we went across the street to Rock Bottom. I'd been there a couple times before, and figured our experience would be fine (if nothing to write home about).

The hostess told us we could seat ourselves in the bar area, so we did. I thought it was odd how many empty tables were in the bar area.

Then we waited. And waited. And waited. We asked for a server twice. I would have left at this point but half of our group was really hungry and I knew it would be tough to get a table at other nearby spots. 

We did finally get a server, but I could tell she would have rather been anywhere else that night, and maybe she did go somewhere else because we didn't see much of her during our visit. Getting water took a long time. Getting cocktails took a long time. Placing an order took a long time. Our food (chicken sandwich, burger, salad, hot wings) took about an hour to arrive, and based on the temperate of my sandwich I'd guess it was sitting in the window for at least a quarter of that time. Getting our check took a long time.

I'd give only 1 star, but previous visits were acceptable."}
{"text":"Beer: Just Ok
Service: Timely and friendly
Food: My expectations were a bit higher. I ordered the Cajun fish tacos. (Highly recommended by the bar staff) More lettuce than fish, to much of the sauce, came with rice that was not fully cooked, along with beans that were cold and topped with chopped chives. Overall the tacos tasted like something from Taco Bell and the sides were all I could salvage of the meal. Friend had a chicken sandwich that was clearly re-heated chicken, stale bun, one slice of avocado and soggy fries. 

Apparently people love this place. I'd come back to have a beer and an appetizer but probably stay away from the rest of the menu. Over priced and overrated!"}
{"text":"We usually have an amazing time here and never had an issue our usual server Elizabeth is a doll and I recommend if you ever go request her. We ate there last night and had the nachos which we usually get. They weren't as good as they usually are. We had another couple with my boyfriend and I we all ate the nachos, this morning when my boyfriend woke up he woke up throwing up and signs of food poisoning. Later on discovering the other couple was experiencing this as well. But I wasn't. But then again I didn't eat the chicken on the nachos. I'm assuming it was undercooked which was extremely unacceptable. I won't be back for awhile because of this. It's unfortunate because we always have enjoyed going there. But it is what it is. I wouldn't recommend going here."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday afternoon. Waited for 15 min until we had to flag down the hostess to take our drink order. Our nachos came out without the chicken we ordered and when they did arrive it was just a plate of burned chips with some cheese sprinkled on them. They did comp us some cheese dip so that gets you an extra star I guess.  At least the beer is good."}
{"text":"$28.00 ...WOW!!!! For Brewery chicken nachos, Crispy chicken fingers, Rock bottom chicken wings, and 4 pale ale beers! You ask how so cheap? They have happy hour on Sunday while the football games are showing. Oh and the food, atmosphere, and the service was excellent too."}
{"text":"***Update***

Stopped in tonight on a whim... Beer was good but the service was much better. I suppose I caught them on an off night last time. Got the chicken fried chicken and it was not only excellent but plentiful enough for lunch tomorrow. Hats off to Paul the bartender; an ultra professional! Great atmosphere, great food, great beer all served with a touch of class equaling five stars and a high recommendation. Thanks for a nice evening RB!"}
{"text":"We come here often and are never disappointed. They have very good beers (I especially enjoyed the Blonde Summer Honey which is seasonal). 
They have mac n' cheese that is out of this world. The summer chicken quesadilla is really good as well. The nachos come out on a huge platter and the serving is big, but they aren't anything to write home about, pretty run of the mill.

The location at Desert Ridge is great because it seems like we can always get in when Yard House or BJs are slammed. The happy hour is comparable to the other restaurants of its kind in the area so you arent missing out on any big discounts. 

Plenty of TVs for watching sports. Good music and an enjoyable atmosphere. 

I gave this place one extra star because there beers here are very good."}
{"text":"I personally did not enjoy being in this place too much but they have a wide variety of beers that can suffice for a casual catch up over drinks/single outing."}
{"text":"Your typical corporate no local atmosphere restaurant and brewpub. This is however the best of the Rock Bottoms in the valley because the quality of the beer seems to be better here than at their other brewpubs.  Food and beers are resonably priced. It is worth it to become a mug club member for additional discounts. My biggest negative is just that it is flat out boring to go to."}
{"text":"I think its funny that when I went to UCSD, there was a Rock Bottom close to campus and I never went. I finally got to try it during our trip to Phoenix. 

We went to Rock Bottom with Brian D's family to celebrate his Dad's Birthday.  We made a reservation and had issues with waiting.  

I got an IPA and a BBQ chicken sandwich and both were pretty good.  I am a weirdo and like when you get shredded lettuce on a burger/sandwich instead of just a piece of lettuce.  The fries were not anything special so I wish I had gotten a different side. 

Overall, service was good but our waiter did disappear for a while towards the end of our meal but cited that it was starting to get busy."}
{"text":"Beer is good, strawberry margarita is delicious!! The jalapeño pretzel bites are an appetizer worth paying for!! Wish it wasn't just seasonal, they should have it all year round! Food was so yummy! Our server Brittany was so nice and helpful! Definitely a place I would visit again :)"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my time at Rock Bottom. I had the fish and chips. My husband ordered stuffed peppers, and my friend had a chicken and avocado sandwich. All of us were pleased with our food. My husband was especially pleased with his stuffed poblanos.

All three of us ordered beer flights. I liked everything except for the IPA, which is normal for me (I'm not a big fan of IPAs). My favorite was the Black Velvet Lager. 

Our server was on point. I was never left waiting for water refills, and he was friendly and efficient. Overall a very pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"It's back! After quite a slump in quality and prices, happy hour is great again. Fresh beer for under $3, jalapeño pretzel stix and amazing chicken apps for $5. Our favorite local happy hour patio once again!"}
{"text":"Not a lot of variety on the menu. And prices are pretty high for the food they do have, that you can get cheaper somewhere else. Food was not good! We got our food, took a couple bites and we were grossed out. The lettuce to our salad was dry and tasted old. The Mac n chicken was watery and the chicken didn't taste like it was fully cooked.  We also got the pretzel chicken and the only thing that I could eat was the mashed potatoes. The green beans weren't fully cooked either they were still hard and very oily. We aren't the type to give our food back so we just asked for boxes and our check and we left. Do not reccomend this place to eat!  It has really hit rock bottom!!"}
{"text":"The beer is truly amazing, the food is good. 
Bartenders are friendly and quick to be helpful - along with management always friendly and honest to god happy to see you and hear your thoughts. 

Great place to watch sports, chat up new friends, and drink some great brew beer by Brian Helton. LOVE IT!!!"}
{"text":"First time here , only thing nice about this place is the location. The food from the frozen baked wings , bland Mac and cheese , tasteless stuffed brisket burger , and let's not forget the pepperoni pizza that Sam's food club can do better . This has to be the worse bar food for game watching in Charlotte, NC ."}
{"text":"first off, me and my wife went here many times since moving to charyork [since everybody here is from nyc!!!]lol.  the fist two times the food was great! let me recomend the spicy nachos!!! omg! the best! in charlotte! and the shrimp and grits! southern perfection! but the 3rd times the charm! were in the hell did they get there waiter staff from the circus! these guys and gals have no sense of whats going onin the kitchen. if better give your waiter or waitess step by step directions on our food! but for the money and qulity of food rock bottom gets passed on the chop block!"}
{"text":"It was good. The beers were fun to sample. We sat at the bar and shared an appetizer sampler platter. One bartender was sort of unfriendly and the other was pleasant and made conversation with us. The appetizers left a lot to be desired. I'm wondering about the jalapeno dip would be eager to drink than dip. It was extremely liquid-like in consistency. Not really a dip. The southwest eggrolls were pretty decent. The wings were average, but cooked perfectly. Overall, it was ok. I wont be racing back for the food any time soon and ill steer clear of the abrupt bartender. The little blonde girl behind the bar who served us the remainder of our visit is worth asking for....if I could only remember her name. Anyway, if I'm in the area again, I will stop in for a beer."}
{"text":"Rock Bottom has amazing desserts. 
Chocolate cake, carrot cake, brownie sundae, apple pear crisp...take your pick- they're all equally delicious. 
I know some people go here because they love the beer- but I go for the desserts.
The food is really good too, my brother loves the chicken fried steak and I usually get some kind of pasta dish. 
Wish I could tell you more about the food, but it's only the desserts that stand out in my mind. 
The times I've gone, there has been a realllly long wait, so plan for that. But if you're a fan of all things dessert, Rock Bottom is for you."}
{"text":"This is almost directly across the street from The Fox and Hound...and suffers not a whit in comparison! Huge menu, both in food and ale. A little *too* big inside-makes for a lack of intimate conversation, but if you want to enjoy a group outing... very nice indeed. On the whole, the staff was knowledgeable and friendly. Waiting times are sometimes longer than I care for...
My only beef with Uptown dining is the absolute dearth of parking. This has the advantage of being across from a good-sized parking lot."}
{"text":"While I am not much on chain restaurants, Rock Bottom is certainly a place we will be visting again.  

My boyfriend and dining partner in crime is a huge beer lover.  Rock Bottom offered a great variety that he was pleased with and the brewery atmosphere is really cool.  The spirit and wine offerings were also pretty good with a solid variety of wines and the usual spirits (with some fun cocktail options).

The menu is huge and offers enough to please anyone.  Our server was extremely sweet, quick, and very knowledgeable of the menu.  She passed the test when she offered solid beer recommendations with food pairings.  The food was surprisingly good.  We tried the southwest eggrolls to start (holy carbs and cheese) and then split a salad with flat bread pizza.  Once we finished dinner we moved to the bar...which I made a note on to visit for game days.  Spectacular set up with plenty of seating.  

The gem of this place is actually the bartenders.  I'm sure that it's no surprise that if one sits at a bar, they are most likely going to chat with the bartenders.  These girls were hilarious and carried on great conversation with us without seeming imposing - which is the key to a great bartender.  We were enjoying the atmosphere so much we moved our evening plans to Rock Bottom and had friends meet us there.  

Good food, great service, great drinks...we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The beer was awesome.  I ordered the kobe beef burger, WOW, tastiest burger I've had in a long time.  Service was good.  Be back again."}
{"text":"Rock Bottom Brewery is among the better chain brewery joints.  And the one in Cleveland is my favorite of their chain, with San Diego being second.

The beers are outstanding, fresh, flavorful and at just the right temperature.  They don't make it too cold (beer isn't supposed to be 33 degrees!).

The typical bar food is just that, typical.  So fish and chips, burgers, sandwiches and  basic pasta dishes are all good enough to get by.  The beer makes it taste even better, of course.

I would recommend this place.  It's large and crowded and among the most fun places in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday night during a playoff game so they were pretty busy and we had a party of eight, but surprisingly there wasn't a super long wait to be seated. The waitress greeted us after about a fifteen minute wait, and was very pleasant. We placed our drink orders which came out pretty quickly and the alcoholic beverages were on point. Shortly after receiving our drinks we placed our appetizer and entree orders. The appetizers came out fine, but after ordering a second round of drinks everything there after was downhill. We waited quite sometime for our second round of drinks, but we were told the bar was backed up which was understandable but after waiting another twenty minutes with no drinks our patience began to wear thin. Another server showed up to the table to assist our waitress and said that she was sent to run the drinks and inquired about what we had ordered but she never returned. The entrees began to come out and all the orders except two were completely wrong, luckily the head chef for the night made every effort to correct our waitresses mistakes. The manager on duty got wind of all the issues we were having and also assisted in making sure everyone was taken care of. Our original server at this point had still not returned to the table, it wasn't until after most of the mistakes had been corrected that she showed up and then completely blamed it on the kitchen as if she was not the one who had put in our order incorrectly. The manager and chef were very accommodating taking several items off our tickets as well as giving everyone a forty percent discount for our patience. The food was amazing, everything was delicious. My only advice would be to hire better wait staff, or at least wait staff that works well under pressure."}
{"text":"Something for everyone; that's the title I would give rock bottom. I love the food and selection. My favorite item on the menu is the Cajun Pasta. It's a spicy rendition with onions, celery, green peppers, chicken, Andouille and shrimp and this delectable Cajun cream sauce with bread on the side. I always have enough for lunch the next day because it's a huge portion and the best part is that it's not dry. 

They have recently updated and remolded the restaurant and menu. I like the enhancements of both. The menu has finger foods that are sure to get you by and crafted entrees to fill up before heading out. 

The bartenders are creative and can provide what's on the menu and even what's not. They have a really nice flight special that you can sample a few before making a decision or make a date tasting out of it. 

The location is not ideal but if you are Uptown for an event the food is better than your traditional white glove five star restaurant. On the weekends this place can get a little busy so be prepared however it is definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband for drinks & apps.  Great place! Good food!  I had wine & my husband had different beers."}
{"text":"This place is great! All bartenders and servers are very nice and attentive. Several great beers and awesome Mac n cheese. Never been disappointed. Also great location near the improv, Dave and busters and Loews theatre. Definitely get there early on Thursday nights though because it gets packed for trivia"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice during my work travels to Pittsburgh. It's great. Service has been fantastic. Never have to wait for a table. You can see the brewery while at the bar and one side of the restaurant though giant glass windows. You can take home growlers of beer. Food was very good. I am picky and they accommodated anything I wanted to edit on the menu. It's very clean and continently located"}
{"text":"This place is wretched, and the service always sucks! We were one of only 3 tables in the place at 3:30pm and still had trouble getting served. The manager, or what looked like the manager (a person carrying keys, doing voids, and walking behind the bar) not once made eye contact with us. The server had to ask \"just so I get this straight...you ordered the salad with ranch\" We ordered the Ahi app, chips and guacamole, and the full-rack of ribs. The food was tasty, but once again the service sucks. Our server tried to give our tab to the ladies behind us, then complained out loud that the other server screwed things up, all the while we were waiting for the tab. He then had to explain that I really would not be getting charged twice, it would only be on my credit card for a few days. No one ever said thanks for coming in, and we were left to walk out...never to return."}
{"text":"Portions are terrible it was difficult to get me food all at the same time. Decent tasting. Beer isn't bad, I wouldn't come back for the food at all. Service was decent. Never got a refill of my drink. And I'll probably want a half an hour for the check"}
{"text":"Holy Wow!!! We've only ever had 'Happy Hour appies' here and tonight decided to come for dinner... According to the awesome food reviews... And Boy oh boy absolutely robust and flavorful!!  The Jalapeño cheesy bread appetizer was just fantastic !! I am a picky person and the House Ranch, Is Bomb!, balsamic vinaigrette, is awesome!! And wait for it.... RB Ale Chicken, just absolutely mouth watering! Thought it was fried green onions but turns out, Fried Leeks, Love the extra Peppery flavor!!!Oops can't forget the craft beer, I love the Blonde :) boyfriend loves the Irish Stout, or the  Brunette  as he calls it!! Haha ! Yum yum and just yum!! 
And best of all the service was sublime!  Kayla and Ryan were very attentive, smiles and all! :)"}
{"text":"I really like this place a lot. My favorite entree is the Texas ribeye. It is amazing. The steak is always cooked perfectly and I never need steak sauce. I get the ribeye with mashed potatoes and green beans. Also, I usually add some type of drink from the bar and I'm happy. The staff has always been pleasant and this location usually has some form of musical entertainment on Friday and Saturday nights. This just takes the atmosphere to better level. I'll be back."}
{"text":"To start off with the good, the food was amazing. I would give that 5 stars in a heartbeat. However, the service... not so much. Went today (Saturday) at 5pm, sat immediately which was nice, however our server was stand off-ish at first which gave a bad impression, throughout our meal it got much better. But half of the staff was hanging out at the host stand, close to our table, laughing and talking and lingering around talking about people as they walked into the restaurant. It was extremely unprofessional especially in a higher quality restaurant. Overall the food was very very good, but if we ever do go back I hope to have a much different experience."}
{"text":"I came out to watch the Hornets game during Game 6 of the 2016 NBA Finals. Despite there being a crowd, service did not suffer and our waiter was quick and attentive. I wasn't particularly hungry and ordered the Mexican Street Tacos. They were tiny - with a speck of fish, regular old hot sauce, and some slaw. They were disappointing to say the least and if I were being a diva, I would've sent them back. I would discourage anyone from ordering these disappointing mini flavorless tacos. My friend ordered chips and guacamole. It was served in a tiny bowl that you would see in an elementary cafeteria for your sides. NOT what you would expect for an appetizer. It was the size you would expect if you ordered guacamole on something else. I'll give this place another shot later, but the food needs to get up to par with the restaurant's cool atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"We had been to RBB before, so we were expecting bar food and a really casual atmosphere. Well, apparently they have remodeled in the last year or so, and now have a nice modern ambiance. 

The menu was not at all what I remembered, and that was a plus. I ordered the Chicken-fried-chicken, and my husband had the Classic Mac'n Chicken. Let me just say, it was the best chicken fried chicken I've ever had. The meat was so light and delicious! The mashed  potatoes were good, but nothing to write about. His Mac'n \"roasted\" Chicken was perfect. He loved every bite of it. The portion looked small, but ended up being just enough to fill him up. 

We were there on a Saturday for lunch. Surprisingly there were quit a few families there with small, very small children. There was ample seating all over the restaurant, but the hostess sat us right beside a high-chair, with a whinny baby in it. Of course, I immediately asked to be moved and they accommodated us with no problem. Later more small children came in, and of course the hostess sat the kids right near us rather than near the other children. 

My advice for all hostess is to sit children near other children and couples near other couples. It makes for a much better meal."}
{"text":"Food was very good and reasonably priced. Had great draft choices. I would recommend going early especially on the weekends or sit in the bar area. Very crowded and noisy"}
{"text":"We haven't been to Rock Bottom in a long time. We received a gift card so decided to stop for a late lunch today. 

Our server was amazing. She was friendly, attentive and we never waited, but weren't hovered over either. Our glasses were constantly refilled as well. 

We ordered the nachos, the veggie tacos and the 2 AM burger with the mashed potatoes. Everything was fresh, flavorful and really good. 

As a vegetarian, I always appreciate having more than one option to select from. 

We were pleasantly surprised and enjoyed our visits."}
{"text":"Great service , atmosphere, food and drinks . Staff and management were so friendly,  they were constantly checking in us without intruding . Everyone has a smile on their faces , they seemed to really enjoy their job and not just pandering for a tip."}
{"text":"Went with a group after work for dinner and a brew.  We ordered a few appetizers first.  The wings are good and the soft pretzels with spicy spinach cheese dip was fun.  Had a burger, you can create your own from veggie, turkey, or fresh ground beef. Had a fresh ground beef and the meat was fresh and cooked perfectly with a fresh bun.

The brew pub is nice and was surprised it wasn't busier."}
{"text":"We were given a 30 minute wait time, which we figured would be okay given it seemed pretty busy. 45 minutes later, we have still not been buzzed and we see a few tables sat ahead of us. Come to find out the host staff has assigned a faulty buzzer to us, which they knew was faulty and didn't try to look for us when we didn't come up. We get a half apology and are sat at the table that's been sitting empty for at least 20 minutes. We were sitting right in the waiting area of the restaurant and aren't sure why when we didn't answer the page, no one walked around to see if we were there like we saw the host doing for other parties. Anyway, whatever, we let it roll off our backs once we get our drinks. We order fairly quickly, as by now we have two \"starving\" kids and four hungry adults. We got the jalapeño pretzels and bacon wrapped jalapeños for our appetizers (so good, by the way), and order our dinner while we are still eating.  We waited at least 45 minutes for our food to come out. 45 minutes... with one half hearted apology from our waitress a few minutes before the food came out.  The food was good, definitely did not warrant us spending 2 1/2 hours at this restarting. My mother in law got to the point where she wasn't hungry anymore and left us after paying the bill. For as many mistakes as this restaurant has made, you would think the management would have been alerted to try to make things right for their customers. Only reason it gets three stars is because the food and drinks were good.

Update: I emailed their customer care based on response to this review,three times, over two weeks ago and have not received a response. Bumped my review down to two stars because that is just irresponsible customer service."}
{"text":"This place was great! Their menu is HUGE - which can be a good and bad thing. Good if you know what you want. Bad if you're totally indecisive like me. =) There is such a big variety, you will definitely find something you like and if you don't you're not human. Luckily, I had a friend recommend the fish tacos so I went with that. It was a hard taco wrapped in a soft taco with melted pepper jack cheese, and all the regular taco garnishes. Was fantastic. A little on the spicy side for me, but I'm truly a baby when it comes to that so don't go by my spicy judgment. Also, I want to add that the server was extremely nice by letting me only get the tacos. I didn't want the extra rice & beans so she took a couple dollars of the meal price and just gave me the tacos. 

Obviously Rock Bottom is known for their beers and they definitely had a great selection to offer. I tried a few =) but ended up really liking the Brown Ale the best. 

They were packed when we went but we didn't have to wait too long for our food and our service was on point! Clean place too. 

Would definitely hit up this place if I'm ever back in Charlotte again. =) Go try it!."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 5 and was seated promptly upon arriving. The waitress was efficient for the most part, she didn't let our cups get empty. The cups weren't the most clean though and at one point we were trying to find the waitress for several minutes but she was apparently busy. It was one of my friends' birthday so we needed to discreetly order him a birthday slice of cake while he was in the restroom. No biggie overall. I'd definitely come back for the food and the atmosphere. Would've given 4 stars but the not so clean cups took it down to a 3."}
{"text":"This had to be one of the worst dining experiences we have ever had.   Service was slow and the food was cold. The batter on the fish would have been great if the meal had been warm. One of the worst Bloody Marys I have had here in Charlotte.  The ladies bathroom had no toilet paper!!  If these facilities had been visited before ordering our meal and not afterwards we would have found another place to eat.  On leaving the restroom one of the kitchen staff was being escorted from the kitchen as obviously unwell.  After seeing this and the meals we were served I felt sick to my stomach"}
{"text":"If you've never been to a brewpub, then maybe the shiny casks behind the windows will intrigue you and you'll be overwhelmed by the awesomeness of the idea of a brewpub as you ask your server what they have that is like bud light.

If you are looking for great craft beer, theres more and more brewpubs popping up around town which are worth your attention."}
{"text":"Went here for fathers day with my girlfriends parents because they gave a free entree for dad. He choose the fish and chips which looked amazing, I had fish tacos, my girlfirend had the steak and her mom got a salad. Everyhting was good. The service was great and the beers were decent. It was everything I could expect from a chain and thensome. I might even go back."}
{"text":"The perfect pick-me-up for when you've hit rock bottom! Great brews, fabulous food and terrific service. The atmosphere was amazing. Lively and upbeat, but still relaxed enough to enjoy your meal. 

The flat bread was full of flavorful, rich and melty cheese and the crust was light, crispy and perfectly prepared. I can't forget about the sweet and spicy dynamite shrimp which lasted a total of 5 minutes. Everything was better than great. Truly a 5 start experience in my eyes. 

I'm already looking forward to planning the next visit. Lucky for me it's just a short drive away :) Get there now, what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"I come here once a week to play poker with the Dream Dealers. First of all the weekly poker tournament is the best in the Valley. Having played at a few on the West Side now the setup at Rock Bottom is the tops.

They have a special menu for us and anything on there has been great. I usually get the Chicken Cesar or the Burger. Never been disappointed yet. Also the crowd favorite, especially by the dealer is the Macaroni and Cheese. All very tasty and something I look forward to every Monday night."}
{"text":"The food is always plentiful, the atmosphere lively, the service friendly, and even though it's always busy, I rarely have to wait for a table. 

If you're a nachos fan, this is the place! Often, I just make it my appetizer, salad, and meal. Yes, it's that big. 

Even though I'm not a big beer drinker, I enjoy their sampler, and I LOVE their cider; it had just the right amount of kick."}
{"text":"The service sucks big time. The back bartender was rude as hell. And their prices are jacked up for what they offer. This is Peoria and there are tons of places to eat. So later on Rock Bottom."}
{"text":"We only ordered appetizers and they were your average wings and chicken tenders. Average American food. Nice place to have a drink and enjoy the outside patio area...especially at night."}
{"text":"Microbrewed beers are only a plus to me when they're better than the beer I would have drank otherwise.  One waitress I had while there tried to split the uprights between macrobrew and trendy by describing one of their beers as \"kind of like Coors Light\".  If I wanted Coors, I'll pay half as much and have one.  

The food is actually a saving grace, as it was pretty good.  Head next door to Sing Sing for drinks, though."}
{"text":"It was ok...good crowd for at Tuesday so all of those that complain about no crowd must go at really odd times.

Black and tan was black - they could not separate the two..disappointing.

Food was ok, not outstanding.

The burger was rated as very good; Jambalaya....fair at best...two friggin shrimp could they spare it?

Service was ok...I might go back but if it's not any better, then adios.

Oh yeah, when you unroll your utensils the last thing you want to see is someone else's dinner stuck to your knife - (gagging sounds kick in here)."}
{"text":"Rock Bottom Brewery has closed its doors in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I was at rock bottom twice. The food has been good each time but I had the pretzel crusted chicken and it was excellent! The service is always excellent and quick!"}
{"text":"Yawn.  Yet another so-called \"brew pub\", exactly like the one before and exactly like the one after ... boring.  In fact there are, at last count, six virtually identical \"brew pubs\" in Desert Ridge alone, and Rock Bottom does absolutely nothing to stand out.

The menu is limited and boring and too expensive for what you get (my Quesadilla was one tortilla folded in half with a slice of cheese and a few slivers of dry chicken for $8.95. That plus a side salad and one mediocre beer was almost $25.

At 7:30 PM the place was almost empty.  Hmm, didn't I write the same thing about another brew pub at Desert Ridge that went belly up a few days later?

The choice of beers is THEIR choice of what they have ... no cold frosty Bud served here!

And I use the term \"served\" extremely loosely.  Like the slew of other brew pubs that are nothing more than a Denny's that serves beer, the service is non-existent.   I've seen a trend at the look-alike brew pubs that they seem to hire either attractive but very bored women or buzzed up guys who think they are auditioning for a comedy store audition.

Even the manager could use some training.  He stopped by our table because he recognized someone he knew.  Big fat huggy/kissies for that person and \"so glad to see you\" while he treated the rest of our party like chopped liver. Not even a \"hope you enjoy your meal\".

I couldn't wait to get out of there, screaming to myself that I really felt that I had been to rock bottom."}
{"text":"We came on a Thursday and ordered the beer sampler and Southwest egg rolls. 

- Happy hour extended! Great Waitress! It ended at 630 but she was kind enough to let it slide. 
- Egg rolls taste more like a flauta. 
- Sample 6 beers. 3rd one is too hoppy. 1st and last are the best. good deal for $7. 
- Lots of TVs. Big party friendly.
- Just like SD and SJ."}
{"text":"This place was great for atmosphere and large groups but the food actually sucked.  We ordered from the happy hour appetizer menu and our server was pretty slow and forgetful. She brought one of us crab dip that was cold (supposed to be served hot), then took forever to bring the drinks back. I asked if the southwest egg rolls were very spicy before I ordered, she said no and low and behold I get them and they are spicy.  The drink (margarita) was very strong and not sweet enough. Overall they get a D for food and an A for ambience and location."}
{"text":"As I work in the immediate vicinity of Rock Bottom's, I dine (or take out) there at least once a week. 

The food there is glorified over priced bar food. It is almost impossible to spend under $10 for lunch there.

That said, the sandwiches are reasonably good, as are the fries. Some rave about their mac & cheese, but I wasn't impressed. Gluey and tasteless.

I've had to send back burgers on more than one occasion to get it to the ordered temperature. 

I do like their chicken sandwiches a lot. A nice sized portion with tasty options. The salads are also quite good, but too big. I'd be happy to pay half price for half the salad.

Overall, good, not great."}
{"text":"Here for work and first time as well never heard of this place. Came for lunch and the service was fantastic. I sat the bar and spilled sauce all over my shirt and the bartender immediately)without asking) gave me a towel with club soda. I'm vegan and the chef came out and spoke to me and made me, maybe the best vegan burger (on a pita) that I've ever had. The chimichurri provided was an awesome touch!  I will be back again!"}
{"text":"This place is great if you've never had a beer or food not from a third world country. Avoid this place as if it were the sticky table I am sitting at writing this. The beer is undrinkable and the food is pretty bad. However, the salad came with a great surprise, soup at the bottom! Or dishwater."}
{"text":"We waited for almost an hour, while groups smaller and larger, who had arrived both before and after us, streamed in and out. When we checked on our table status, they only replied \"You have 19 minutes\" to wait. I guess it didn't matter that I could see tons of open tables if they have some sort of seating timer. Once we were seated, our waiter was quick but that's just about the extent of anything nice I have to say. The other folks in our party mentioned that the burgers were pretty good; however, my Cuban Cristo was a mess. It had too much batter and was fried too long, resulting in a greasy, brick of a sandwich. And, for a brewery, I was extremely disappointed by the small size of their beer list. Overall, it was a mediocre experience with forgettable food. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Took my Co worker out to eat.My bill came up to $28.97 but my credit card was charged for $70.00.l sign my credit paper for $28.00.call Restaurant  back ask to speak to Manager that never happen. Who ever answered  the phone told me last was only charged for $28.00 ,just kept on talking to me like last lied.Staff should be trained better than that.Also caused my account a overdraft fee,let knew how much longer could spend. Management stated it was a mistake  but how long for a $28 dollar bill."}
{"text":"The food was ok, several people in my party had a cold food. We asked to have it heated. Our server Tiffany was not very attentive to us. We felt like we had to beg for utensils and we were never checked on. Poor service. Won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere.... not so great food.  What I ordered came wrong had to wait for my right order.  Slow service...had to wait for refills on water and drinks.  Had chicken wings and they were tough.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Good service and great food. Only draw back was no fault of restaurant. We were seated next to some screaming children. But the restaurant found us better seating."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed this location and company. I never have to wait for a table or I can simply eat at the bar. Reasonably priced as well. Every time I come here, I get the Bacon Chicken Mac 'N Cheese. With roasted chicken, bacon, tomatoes and mushrooms. Topped with more bacon, Parmesan breadcrumbs and green onions.  Honestly the BEST entree Bacon Mac N' Cheese I have ever had. There's no need to even add any flavor or sauce to this, by far the best as it melts in your mouth. A MUST TRY, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great staff at the Arrowhead location. The beer - made on site - is of course the star of the show. My favorite is the Arrowhead IPA! Hops up Arrowhead  Great burgers - I go bunless, - good apps, really good food all around. I don't like going to the mall but \"I love this bar\" ... and there is a Trader Joe's next door. But that's a different review"}
{"text":"Nothing here really blew me away..  Yeah, it's pretty cool that they brew their own beers and they are located on Tryon but... eh.  This spot is one step above an Applebees.  Dont get me wrong, I kinda like Applebees.  Just dont expect anything amazing.  I would suggest sitting outside and enjoying a nice day.  That might make it a little better.  I would also suggest you try the artichoke/crab dip.  That was rather delicious.  I would say, give it a try but know.. There are much better places in the city.  Enjoy!

-Ian M."}
{"text":"The Micro-Brews are wonderful and te food is also great! I only rated it 3star because our waitress was below par"}
{"text":"Went there last night for dinner - there were 6 of us.  We were seated within 10 minutes.  We ordered drinks, then our food (burgers, mac & cheese, steaks).  The burgers were ok.  They were big, cooked correctly - one was great, the other was just salty.  The mac & cheese was amazing.  The steaks had great flavor, but one was overcoooked and tough.  The worst part about the evening was the service.  Our server was friendly and great when he stopped by, but he didn't stop by nearly enough.  After we received our food, we had a complaint as one of the steaks was overcooked and tough.  Our server didn't stop by until the meal was nearly over (about 15 minutes).  By the time he stopped by, everyone was finished eating, our drinks were empty, and we were ready to leave.  The manager removed the steak from the bill.  When we went to pay, it took over 10 minutes from the time we asked for the check to the time we could sign the receipt."}
{"text":"Just like all the other posts suggest.... food and beer is good- the service is god awful."}
{"text":"Rock Bottom was our first stop on a 17 mile pub crawl.  As expected, the bar was lively, the food was good, and the service was accommodating,  The beers are better than Church Brew Works and the bar was populated.  The bartender readily offered a taste of beer and gave us a hat to wear for the rest of the crawl.  
I vote for Rock Bottom as the anchor store of the Water Works."}
{"text":"Nice.  Only four stars because the server didn't bring out what was ordered... she did catch it before it was served but after a very big deal was made about NO SQUASH on the plate, its amazing the plate was served up with any.  

But, the food was excellent.  Ordered the Bourbonzola burger which was wonderful and some appetizers.  Good quick seating and service, other than mentioned above, and will most certainly go back."}
{"text":"My friends got everyhing from steak(they didn't even get a well done steak right) to mahi tacos and the only great menu item was the seasoned vegetables- give it a miss. Sing sing next door is awesome but get dinner somewere else. After we were done the waiter asked if we were ready for the checks and I had ordered meal that came with a desert! Really dissapointing all around."}
{"text":"We went for our anniversary dinner. The food was great. There chicken and Mac and cheese is a classic and everyone should try it. 

Service was typical and we had no problems at all while we were there. 

This doesn't strike you as your normal brewery that you would find around Charlotte because it's a part of a chain. We tried a flight of their beers and weren't disappointed but it's not a place we will go back to just for the beer. 

The location right downtown is very nice however."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this place way back in the day was it's famous BBQ Chicken Chipotle Pizza. It was by far the best tasting pizza I had ever had and was the main reason I went. 

I recently went back for old times sake at this location, and to my horrible dismay, they had replaced the style of that pizza with one that emulates how other restaurants had done it. No longer was the unique taste there, but instead, a water-down, blah-fest, full of corn. I'm not kidding - actual corn filled the pizza to the brim.

Despite this, the beer here is great. Sometimes, on weekdays, they open the vats and filled the restaurant with the aroma of brewing, yeast infected beer. While this may make some of the more hardcore beer patrons happy, it usually sickens everyone else.

The prices are legit and I don't feel as though I'm getting molested by the waiters/waitresses. 

Back in the day, this place was a 5, now it's still a solid 3...but not much more."}
{"text":"Rock Bottom Brewery is a chain of microbrew restaurants, and the Ahwahtukee location is one of the worst ones I've been two (been to three). 

The best thing about this establishment is the $3 draft/$3 appetizer happy hours, but that is sadly eclipsed by the poor service, ambiance and quality of food. The beer - overall - is fair. There were no clear cut winners. The stout was not so good: I ended up returning it for the nut brown ale, which fared slightly better. The pale ale was better.

The service was negligent and awful. She was inattentive, and ended up serving me a beef burger after a conversation with her about getting a veggie burger. Funny thing is, the place wasn't packed last night either. I'm not looking for four-star service, but complete lack of attention stands out for me. Also, the family-style setting (tons of suburban families) really didn't do it for me, so I'll probably only come back if asked to by a friend, not on my own will."}
{"text":"The food's good, the beer's usually good, the brewmaster's awesome. If I could rate a restaurant just on those criteria, it would easily be a 4-star joint.

But this Rock Bottom location has a chronic, nagging problem: The service.

Several years ago they were great--waitstaff was on their game, management was always around to check on things and even work the floor. Since that time, the awesome management has been promoted up into corporate and the service really hasn't been the same. A 30 minute lunch turns into an hour, drinks remain empty, the bill sits on the table while you try in vain to get your waiter to pick it up. 

Occasionally Rock Bottom teases me with a great service, but then it just lets me down with another trip to slowsville on the next visit. Good eats if you've got the time, but don't go expecting a quick meal."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a beer drinker, but my fiancee is a major enthusiast, so I agreed to tag along.  I'm glad I did!  Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the extensive house-brewed beer selection, and helped me to pick one I would love (the kolsch was very crisp, light, and drinkable.)  The food was standard pub fare with a twist, well-executed.  My burger was topped with onion petals and gorgonzola, and cooked to perfection.  The waitress recommended their macaroni and cheese for a side, which was definitely a good choice.  My only complaint is that most of the food was rather heavy, and I spent the rest of the night wallowing on the couch.  Not sure I would make the hour+ trip to Pittsburgh again, but if I found myself in the city, I may just stop by."}
{"text":"I would rate this zero stars but that's not an option. We were told a 20 minute wait Friday evening, it was 46minutes. While waiting we stood at the bar and watched the barmaid that had a permanent scowl on her face. Once seated our waitress took our drink order (waters) and said she would be right back. At that time the restaurant was half empty. She instead went to the terminal and entered past tickets for over 10 minutes. She came back to the table, apologized for the delay and said, \"oops, I forgot your waters\". Several minutes later she returned to take our orders. I ordered the pretzel chicken, she said, \"I think we might be outta that\", so I ordered something else. My husband ordered the steak fajitas. Even though she apologized many times for the fact that she kept us waiting on drinks and order taking, instead of putting our order in immediately she went to her 3 other tables and chit chatted. Then it took over 20 additional minutes to receive our food. Two waiters brought steak fajitas to the table that were literally cold, no sizzle, completely cold to the touch. The mashed potatoes that my chicken was on had a film on them from sitting in the window too long and were cold. We then didn't touch the food and asked for the manager. After waiting an additional 10 minutes with no one coming to the table we left. The manager finally rushed out to catch us and when we explained our experience all he could say was, \"I don't know what is wrong with that girl.\" We then found ourselves sticking up for our waitress saying it wasn't all her fault. If anything manager Kevin and all the managers and owners of this restaurant, it's your fault. If your bar employees seemed pissed to be there, if your wait staff aren't trained on the basics, if your kitchen staff is making half cooked food and your food runners are running fajitas that have zero sizzle and are obviously cold, then management has failed. Manager Kevin did offer to email us a certificate to come back, AFTER my husband asked for his name, but it's not necessary, we have zero plans to ever waste time on Rock Bottom again. It was our first restaurant when we moved to Charlotte many years ago and we typically like to go when we are in the city but each time it has gotten worse and worse. We won't be back. Side note: We were starving when we finally left Rock Bottom at 10:16pm after all of that and went across the street to Duckworths. Their fajitas came out sizzling, my food was great, the waiter was friendly and on top of it. Thank goodness our evening wasn't a total waste."}
{"text":"I think our waiter was sick or something. Or he just hate his job.. the visit here was bad here. There were no hostess, I had to direct myself to a table. Took 15 minutes to get water and the menu.

We ordered the nachos VEGETARIAN of course. Oh dear buddha. It was heaven. All it was missing was salsa or hot sauce. The server took so long to come so I had to get up and help myself to get some. I had to get up to get napkins, and get up to ask for more water..

Pretty much I had a horrible experience."}
{"text":"The beer is great enough to earn 5 stars on its own but the service leaves so much to be desired that I would give negative stars if it were an option! I have to agree with another review that states, \"Rock bottom\" is how you're left feeling, so the name is appropriate. I ordered the flight and was very pleased with all samples. The pretzel duo was just okay. Cheese dips were clumpy with cold spots so microwaved it was! My entree, veggie Mac and cheese was horrible! No veggies except 3 hard mushroom slices and the pasta was chewy. Just gross! Our waitress if that's what you want to call her was basically nonexistent and did not seem to care that my entree had been sitting on end of table for 30 minutes. She offered to bring ticket without checking why my entree was untouched. I let her know it was not done and I wanted it removed. She simply said okay. Wow! Great customer service! I do not recommend restaurants that I feel are a risk so do not take a chance on dining here! The beer is awesome so bar service only may be an okay! I ordered a growler of Blue Ridge Mist to go and of course, the waitress forgot to place the order so I had to wait on this a little longer! The brewery will suffer unless wait staff improve and chef needs to improve also!"}
{"text":"Just attended the brewers dinner. AMAZING!! Food and beer were excellent, perfectly matched. Everyone was truly professional. Bravo Rock Bottom!"}
{"text":"My husband and I got here a couple times a year.    Always (except my veggies today) get great food at a decent price.   I love their side salad..... which has raisins and sunflower seeds.    Burgers are great and my husband loves their chicken Mac and cheese.   Recommend to everyone just get there early for a seat."}
{"text":"The first time I experienced the Rock Bottom Brewery was in downtown Chicago. It was wonderful! I think I went back the next night because I had such a good experience. It's pretty much always packed around happy hour/dinner time because it's a great spot. 

The Pittsburgh location doesn't quite compare. The actual layout, food, service, etc., is average. I ordered the bison burger last night and it was pretty good. But, it was a bit dry and it didn't seem like they put much effort into it. Honesty, when I received my food, it reminded me of being at a place like Applebee's of Chili's. They were out of Mac and cheese because they had had a busy night. I didn't mind that at all because I had tried the Mac and cheese before; you should give it a try if you haven't. 

The waitress was great. She checked in often to make sure we were comfortable. The menu is large. You're sure to find something you want to try. But it's a brewery, so the options are mostly variations of bar foods. It's a cool place to go if you want to eat late and have a decent sized group with you."}
{"text":"I am so fortunate to live close to Rock Bottom. I have been going there since it opened and usually stop in once every week or so. Their Happy Hour is the best value in town with discounts on beer and appetizers.  They have several beers in their regular lineup and constantly vary another half dozen or so.  All are brewed on site.  Try the Jalapeño Pretzel Sticks. They are made with jalapeños in the dough, stuffed with cheese and served with jalapeño spinach dip. Their nachos are served on a huge platter that is more then enough for two. And make sure that you sign up for their loyalty club. It rewards you with discounts and special promotions that make a good value even better. Did I mention that the wait staff in the bar area is their most experienced, longest tenured so you generally get the best service there."}
{"text":"Rock Bottom...Well, that pretty much sums it up:)

Thanks!!

You've been a great audience!!

Don't forget to tip your wait staff (the only part of Rock Bottom worth a little applause:)

I'm not much of a beer drinker, so that part of this chains \"allure\" is really lost on me.

I said in an earlier review that some chains are better than others (or something to that effect:)

This is one of the chains that they are better than:)

The food here could sure be better...really:)

I had lunch meeting at RBB today (nope, I didn't get to pick, but that may change in the future based on this swing and a miss:)

I had their lunch special sliders...as dry and lifeless a rack of mini-burgers as I have seen lately (and that includes the mini-\"sirloins\" available at your local Jack in the Hat:( 

The lunch included a stack of overly greasy fries...just not much worth trying to eat in this \"special\"...but what can I expect for $6.95?

My lunch companion had something that was supposed to be the shrimp enchilada lunch special...also $6.95...I would have to say that based on her reaction, the execution of said \"enchilada\" dish was somewhere short of \"successful\":(

Isn't there supposed to be \"shrimp\" in \"shrimp enchilada\"? No?

Maybe we shouldn't expect more for this kind of price point, but damn it...I do!

Were they having an off day? 

I don't know, but it was a poor effort on the part of the kitchen (I can't speak to the brewery part...they may have been crushing it today:)

You know, we could have gone across the freeway to Vermont Sandwich or Andreoli and had a much better meal for roughly the same price!

Maybe if they changed the restaurant format to \"Rock Bottom Scotch Distillery\" it could bring me back.

Oh, and if the food was better:)"}
{"text":"This is a place where I want to try many things on the menu. The descriptions sound really good and, so far, the meals have been pretty good.

This place isn't bad for food. The beer is alright, but I've had better. The worst part about this place is the service. My husband and I have had the same waiter twice now, and both times he has mumbled his way through service, showed no enthusiasm and didn't pay much attention. But when it was time to leave, he sure did rush us our check.

I would certainly recommend it for the food, but otherwise you might be better off elsewhere."}
{"text":"I am never disappointed with their beer, food , or service. I have visited Chicago and Long Beach and now Charlotte always great and consistent."}
{"text":"I took a client to lunch there yesterday since he worked in the same building.  I was a little surprised with all of the events going on in Charlotte that the restaurant was not busy.  I now can see why.

My client order soup and they brought it without a spoon.  When we asked for one, they brought us a plastic spoon.  I asked if they had any real spoons and they said no.  How can a restaurant not have any real spoons?

I ordered a their special which was a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich.  It was Fair but the fries were cold.  So, this place is nothing special and barely average."}
{"text":"Lately, the Rock Bottom is hit or miss. The beers are always good and the Uppity Jagoff IPA is one of the best India Pale Ales I've ever tasted. The low point lately has been the food. I will never forgive the idiot in management who took the chicken quesadilla off the menu. That said, I ordered the lobster roll and when it arrived, the bread was as hard as a brick and cold. The filling was okay, but the lobster flavor was masked by over spicing. I suggest you eat somewhere else and imbibe at the Rock Bottom."}
{"text":"We got here at the last minute last night before the kitchen closed, there were five of us, and we got right in and had awesome service. We tried two beer flights so we could have the entire beer menu. The flights are priced exceptionally well. We had the nachos for an appetizer, which were good but not the best I've ever had. I had the Brewer's Cobb, which has always been amazing at every Rock Bottom I've ever been to and an extraordinary amount. My husband had the beef tips, which tasted good but didn't have a lot of meat. It left him wanting more. The mashed potatoes and onion straws paired with the tips were good though. The atmosphere was great, it was clean, and our server was friendly and attentive. Very happy with the experience."}
{"text":"There is a wide variety of food choices here, from salads to pizza. Steaks and seafood, Mexican to Cajun. Something for everyone, and great beers on tap all brewed in house as well as bottled beers and a full bar. The servers are friendly and efficient, they know their menu. An excellent choice out side of the box is the \"Bistro filet\", ask for the Ale sauce on the side. My all time favorite is the Shrimp and Crab tower, with avocado in it and Pita on the side."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food. I had the lower calorie beer chicken. The glaze was amazing! The salad with kale had less kale and more coleslaw. I was a little disappointed but the dish itself was yummy. Got pretzel appetizers which were filling and enough to share! Enjoyed the environment outside in the city. The service was a little slow but all in all good casual dinner."}
{"text":"This is sort of a cluster of a story to tell as a review and maybe not a reason for a single star but it's not how things happen but how you deal with them, I'll write.

In town for the week and we decide to have a Holiday night our at Rock Bottom.  Bosses wife sets it up from 6-8 with open tap, appetizers and some other goodies.  Now long story short we get there at 5:45 and it appears there was a mix-up and they had us down from 4-6 (what office does anything at 4 on a Thursday).  They hold our area for an hour, till 5 before the call to see where we are, of course its after 5 so the phone is off.  They don't call the second number, just give away our area.

So again, long story short we show up at 5:45, all 14 of us and we don't have a table.  Manager on duty cops a serious attitude with our boss and it all goes down hill.  We finally get seated and the service is AWEFUL!.  They bring out apps after about 30 minutes but then take them away because they are for the people at the table we were supposed to be at (serious no-no in the biz).  When food does come out it's COLD.

Felt really bad for the two servers although I do think they got tipped well.  As for the management and the kitchen that part was about as bad as you can get.  Beer was half ass and not worth the trip.

Would not return, no way!

{"text":"Sadly this location is now closed :-( Even though someone at corporate keeps updating their statuses on Facebook. What a tease. 

Looks like Glendale is the last standing AZ location. They sure went downhill since Gordon Biersch took over!"}
{"text":"After two recent visits here, I can honestly say I am torn on my review, but overall I know I have had better. Most recently, we arrived shortly after 12 and were seated indoors, because the patio was full, and it took our server over 15 minutes to take our drink order. We started off with the spinach artichoke dip and chips, which arrived 5 minutes before our food. Before I get to the food, the appetizer was cold and came with about 10 chips. Being there were four of us we asked for some extra chips and some salsa. The chips were warm, however the salsa, stay away, unless you like Pace's from the grocery store. Really, are they kidding serving store bought salsa???
On to the food.  We ordered a good variety, stuffed peppers, chicken enchiladas, burger and chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich was burnt and you cook smell the burn! The enchiladas and peppers were so spicy we had to ask for more water. Only positive, the fries, great seasoning!
As for the service, I wish I took her name, but our waitress could have given two sh...about being there and you could tell. No refills, never saw her, except our order and bill, and very blah! 
Not sure we would return anytime soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I got horrible food poisoning from this restaurant. -- so bad in fact , that it warranted medical attention.We contacted their corporate office and were completely blown off by their insurance company.
This establishment has no regard for the well being of its patrons. Since we value our health we will never go back"}
{"text":"Service was marginal and food was not very good.  I remember this place being better, but I guess they changed their menu around a bit ago.  Let's just say I like the old one better.  I will pass on this place moving forward."}
{"text":"Great happy hour, good food, good beer and incentives w/ the Mug Club.  Love it."}
{"text":"At Rock Bottom with a mug full of beer!  So fun.  This is a good location too.  Make sure you join the mug club.  It's free to join and you get free stuff like t shirts, glasses, etc.  AND your beer comes in a mug.  Much better.  Food here kics a** espeically the mac and chicken."}
{"text":"I love the Rock Bottom menu.  The food is great.  I especially reccomend the Classic Mac n' Chicken and the spinach cheese dip appetizers.  Their pizzas and burgers are also good.  I don't think I like their beverage selection as much as Four Peaks though.  But I do LOVE the Mug Club and earning points for cool prizes.  Service is hit or miss at this location."}
{"text":"I love Rock Bottom. This is the second one I've been to other than the one in Chicago. They always keep it up so nicely and the service is great! The beer selection is extensive and the food is excellent as well. Great place to grab a beer with co-workers!"}
{"text":"Does Rock Bottom have the best beer in town...no. But is it good beer...absolutely! Thursday nights their beers are $3! There are other beer specials on the weeknights also. The service can be lacking in the bar area, unless you are actually sitting at the bar, which is typically exceptional.  Food is quite good! Grilled fish tacos are a recommendation ads well as the veggie burger. Just a couple of recommendations but plenty more to choose from! Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"First thing you notice when you walk in is the atmosphere. Typical of a brewery, which to me means the food is gonna be good because I have not had bad food at any brewery I have ever been to. Well, turns out, there's a first for everything! I ignored the greasy top coat on both the booth chair and table and excitedly ordered the calamari to start. It arrived in a huge doughy-like clump that when pulled apart we had discovered some had gone uncooked. The replacement appetizer was much better but we were a little shocked that the first one even made it to the table (it looked terrible). The jambalaya was more than lacking. The sauce tasted very bland. The andouille sausage tasted like the plastic bag it had been stored in. The only good thing I could say about it was it had huge chunks of pulled chicken. Too bad it wasn't good. Their pizza is pretty good and the portion is decent! Unfortunately, we ended up very sick after dinner (most likely the calamari). With better options all over, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Checked this place out while on vacation. They had pretty decent food but the atmosphere was very chain restaurant like. But great beer!"}
{"text":"Lately this has been Sunday football watching spot for my friends and I. We normally occupy one of the long bar table in front of 4 TVs (3 more on the other side) for hours. With that being said, there are hits & misses but overall I am a fan of being a fan at Rock Bottom.

Service is typically of acceptable quality. They can be a little slow in checking in, or filling water, but on the other hand we are there for a long time. 

Food is actually pretty good. They also have game day specials on wings and nachos etc. Half nachos ($6) is good portion, but is without meat, which you can add for $2. They offer their own brew for beer (in case you don't know). They have beer special for Sundays as well. I can safely say that you can't go bad with ordering anything. I had a lobster & shrimp enchiladas and that was good.

Park is free, they validate for the garage under the restaurant. Be careful, my 1st time visit this season ended up charging me money to get out of the garage because the validation barcode was unclear (good news is I got my money back after contacting the parking garage office with proof of my validation via cell phone pic)

The only disappointing thing for our football watching days is: BY GOSH, stay on top of the game scheduling. We all know there are a new round of games kicking off at 4pm, so get the remotes ready and change over the moment 1pm game is over. PLEASE managers on duty??"}
{"text":"Clean bathrooms at busy hours, very cool atmosphere. And oh, great food and brews. Honestly, for my average pallette, I ordered the Ninja Shoe Baltic Porter (AWESOME NAME) and the Jambalaya (don't be scared, it was a perfect amount of spicy) I thought it would be a good flavor mix, and oh my it was!! There was a very big menu selection and I am bringing my family next week so they can enjoy the experience I had. No intimidation here, because all walks of life come here and get treated the same way.  I sat a table and my waitress, along with the Bartender I could here, remembered customers first names and really connected with all of them. Such a great experience. I moved from Chicago, and this is the best bar I have been in for a long time. Please check them out!"}
{"text":"Although the proximity to my house adds convenience as a factor in going to Rock Bottom, the food is less than desirable. 

The beer there is great, it's a fairly clean establishment with a good wait staff, but the food IS AWFUL. I ordered the quesadilla appetizer, and for $10.59 I got 4 mini tortillas, not toasted at all, with some melted cheese and chicken. No salsa, no lettuce, guac, sour cream.  NOTHING. 

Then I was hoping the pizza I ordered would sort of redeem our experience, I got their \"hot\" style pizza since I like spicy food. The small pizza probably had 8 jalapeños worth of peppers, and then some sauce and cheese. It was so underwhelming. I wish the food could match the quality of their beer. Real bummer."}
{"text":"Having a late lunch with my other half. We ordered the Cuban Cristo and the Fish and Fries they where excellent.  Service was excellent. Jessica who was our hostess was also our server. She  very attentive and understanding because I can be a high maintenance customer at times. Definitely will recommend the hidden treasure to my friends and I will be coming back more often. Thank you Jessica you rock!!!"}
{"text":"After an ACN convention our team went to this brewery to celebrate for dinner... We have a pretty large group about 40+ and was seated at different tables. Upon closing  he tabs, Andrea with management decided to call the NCPD because she couldn't manage her host  to close out all the tabs before we had to leave and there were one or two open tabs left. The police informed us about the situation and wouldn't allow the rest of the group to leave until the other tabs were paid and closed out. 
After soaking with Andrea the \"manager\" who couldn't manage her host to close out the checks beforehand... First they said one of the table didn't pay for the food and after an hour of deliberating with the cops they figured the table that left already paid for their food but management is now stating the drinks have not been paid for. 
  I have never experienced such incompetence when it comes to dealing directly with your customers about closing out tabs for large parties. Andrea the manager could have approached one of us to resolve this matter before calling the cops... Seriously don't these officers have something else better to do instead of dealing with a problem or miscommunication like this? What kind of manager would do that specially of there is still a large group left behind even though some table have left already to head back to their hotels after a long day of convention... 
In my opinion this is just plain poor management and my group were 95% Japanese from Japan. This was a very poor impression by getting the cops involved and not being able to handle this while my group was still in the restaurant and the cops informing my group that we would be all going to jail if a $120 tab was not paid. 
Pointers for Andrea the \"manager\" communicate directly with your clients about open tabs left before calling the cops. Learn how to manage the floor to close out the bill since everyone at the table is no longer ordering. And last calling the cops to resolve issues you should handle yourself should be your last resort if the group left the restaurant already. 
Seriously, these were our VIP Japanese colleagues and we did not come to Charlotte North Carolina to get a free meal... There are no free meals in America Andrea! 
And if you fear about losing your job because you couldn't manage the floor to close out tabs... Then you don't belong in management! 
We will never come back here for any meals on our next convention and maybe be corporate will not care about it... Maybe they will....
Bottom line is #Rockbottombrewery will never have any of my business or my colleagues business of patronism ever again when we come back to Charlotte, NC ever! 
I wouldn't even give this place a star for this reason!"}
{"text":"Looking for the perfect Mojito???  Well look no further!    Rock Bottom has by far the tastiest Pinapple Mojitos.   

I stop by Rock Bottom atleast once each time I am in the Charlotte area.    What brings me here? The mojitos and the apple bread pudding.  The steaks, wings, shrimp are good -- but not the reason that keeps me coming back.  

Note:  You can park in the parking garage and get your ticket validated for 2 hours of free parking."}
{"text":"Very conveniently located at the top of the Blue Line, just a short block and half over to Tryon, you can't miss the Rock Bottom facade. I was meeting a friend for a semi-business lunch, so I wasn't able to try any of their house brewed beers (they server Kaliber, but they don't have their own non-alcoholic beer). The back of their lunch menu is all booze - 11 different martinis and 4 different margaritas and a whole bunch more. Definitely a full bar here!

I had read over the previous Yelpers before going, so I had one of their salads - the Goat Cheese and Hummus. It was a huge scoop of hummus (at least a cup, maybe more) with a dressing tossed salad on top of sliced flatbreads. Way too much food, the hummus was sharp and tasty with just enough garlic that it was delicious but not so much that I was worried about my breath heading back to the office. Maybe there could have been more goat cheese, but that's just me complaining because it was good!

My friend had some sort of cheese topped grilled chicken with fries. While it was good, I absolutely won the competition. ;-)

A very pleasant experience. I'd have no problem going back here if I'm Uptown."}
{"text":"I ordered the greenhouse salad, grilled beer-glazed chicken, and the triple chocolate brownie (all not pictured). The food itself was good with perfect portions! The brownie was still warm and very gooey inside. Overall, I had a nice experience with great wait staff! The only complaint is that the lemonade was rather tart, but I'm sure that it is due to people adding sugar to taste."}
{"text":"They lose 1 star for not having any hard cider in stock...supposedly they ran out. I can't drink beer so I was left to drink a very fruity cosmo. 

Overall, this place isn't anything special. I hear the beer is good though. One thing going for them is that they have a great happy hour. $3 drinks and munchies M-F from 3:30 - 6:30. 

The atmosphere is nothing special. Bathrooms were clean though and there is plenty of seating."}
{"text":"Well let's start off with the front door. Very nice staff. Hello and greetings all around. Wait staff on the ball. Ok now that Jalapeño Burger I had. If you want hot this is it. Dang it was good. The wife took one bite and started to cry. NOW THAT IS A BURGER. Now the wife had the Markers Mark burger but they didn't cook it medium like she asked. She says she's had better. Well I am raving on the Jalapeño Burger. Will be going back. Oh yea get the beer flight. 5  6oz glasses of good beer types and the price of one 16oz beer. Well ok close to that price. Can not wait to go back. Will have a Zantac before I go."}
{"text":"Rb ale chicken again is awesome...Ryan the always here Bartender is great!! Killa beer 2 nite...:)"}
{"text":"I was kinda disappointed with Rock Bottom's lunch spread. We've eaten dinner here before and were happy with the service and food. We didn't want to wait for a long service so we opted for bar seating. I was surprised to see such an abbreviated lunch menu. Of course, they were out of the shrimp po boy I wanted, will have to come on another day for that. I went with the chicken spinach flatbread while the bf went for the Tuscan pasta. We waited for a little while but, were brought hot food. I found the chicken spinach flatbread bland and very dry, I think this would be solid lunch food if it came with some sauce or dip. The olive oil by itself does not cut it. The Tuscan pasta was a lite pasta with diced tomatoes, had a mild but, good flavor. 

I doubt I'll come back and order the lunch specials at Rock Bottom, best to stick to the actual entrée options and brews. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I must admit, I do like the brews.  I also like the white cheddar mash potatoes.  Other than that, meh.  The food is pretty forgettable.  Another \"brewery\" that sadly fails to be anything special in the food department.  With the restaurants upping the ante on 8th Ave, you may want to kick it up a notch Rock Bottom.  But how would anyone know to?  It's a chain.  Whomp whomp!"}
{"text":"The first time I went to Rock Bottom, I enjoyed our dinner as it was very tasteful and delicious; however, we received a complimentary dessert due to such a high wait time (barely any people there) and then they messed up my boyfriends order (the meat was not cooked as requested). Despite this we chose to give it 2 more tries, but the next two times we ordered out through Grubhub. I te getting an order wrong at the restaurant, maybe the waitress is distracted or doesn't hear right, but getting an order wrong twice while there are written instructions is just disappointing. I ordered a bacon cheese burger both times, no onions, no pickles, and no BBQ Jalapeño Ranch, BUT I still got the BBQ JALAPEÑO RANCH on my burger. ?? On a good note it was only on one side of the bread so I just took the bottom part off (sad I couldn't enjoy my tasteful burger).  Their Santa Fe fries are good but this time it's like they DUMPED the seasoning on their, the fries were soooooooooo salty it was impossible to eat. They were drowned in the seasoning. I am giving it 3 stars because the meat is flavorful and very good; at this point I'm going to say their service is mediocre. If you can't follow written instructions, then there really is no hope for getting my order right from them ever. So disappointed because it's simple instructions on how I'd like my burger made but they seem not to care. 3 out of 3 times we've had their food they've messed up the order. ?"}
{"text":"Location hurts this place. It's fun to sit outside and watch what North Tryon has to offer the first couple times going here, but it loses its luster. 

No complaints, but nothing stands out here."}
{"text":"Great customer service.  Stopped in for my first time.  Find out their having a free beer tasting in 30 minutes.  Nice surprise.  Plus so far is the service, prices and cleanliness.  Down side is limited menu selection and NO Coronas.  Besides that so far I'd recommend this establishment. 
Ordered the 2 am burger with cheese, bacon and egg.  Yes i said egg.  The egg was suppose to be cooked over easy but it was totally cooked finished so having the experience of having yoke run down the side of the burger was gone.  Besides that the burger and fries taste good.  If your unfamiliar with area and need a cool place to go, try Rock Bottom."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, service is alright - very cookie cutter style of restaurant, but they do brew beer... just like many of their other locations around the nation. 

Beer is good though!"}
{"text":"I gave this place one star because I walked in at 9:30 and the bartender said that they close in 30 min. Why does the sign say 11:00??? That is not cool!!  I also watched a couple came in and was ignored. If the hours are posted, at least try to adhere to those hours. So rude!

That's fine, our party went to Duckworth across the street and had a great time."}
{"text":"Had a large gathering here last night between two different companies. Staff blocked off the area and put signs up indicating it was a private party. Food was warm and drink service was great. Seemed like there was always a server ready to refill drinks. In fact, they had several servers assigned to our group, which was great. Music wasn't super loud and lights dimmed as night hit.  Good experience, no complaints"}
{"text":"Just an okay place. It was a Saturday afternoon and hardly anyone was patronizing the bar. Maybe 20 people max. Most were there to watch the Suns game they were broadcasting. 

The server was very friendly... though a little on the creepy side (I think every woman knows what I'm talking about, am I right?). He went above and beyond, bringing me an entire sample of all their brews, including the Pilsner (seasonal they had) and Cask Brown Ale. \"Because you're pretty,\" he said was the reason. Uhm, okay. 

I opted to go with the Red Ale. It was served in a large glass, and since I was already buzzin' from tryin' about 10 samples, I couldn't finish the ale. My bad.

I ordered a 1/2 salad with 1/2 chicken salad sandwich. The salad, with the side of Ginger Citrus dressing, was good. It was your typical salad, with bacon pieces and shredded cheddar. The 1/2 sandwich, on the other hand, was slathered in too much mayo. Ick. It upset my stomach for the remainder of the afternoon. 

Service was sporadic. It took awhile to place an order and then pay the check. 

All in all, an okay spot to pick when you're in the mood for a sports bar or afternoon brewski."}
{"text":"Went here once. It was a Sunday night. The place was like a morgue. 

Tried the Brown Ale. It hit the spot. 
Then tried the Amber. It was okay. 

Not sure how this place is on the weekdays or weekends, but the beer is decent and strong. So that's something."}
{"text":"Came here before a Panthers game and had a solid time. It's a chain, but they have solid service, good beers, and decent food. All in all they provide what they chalk themselves up to be. Good tvs as well around the bar. I prefer the local Charlotte options, but this is a good alternative."}
{"text":"if you want to stare into a filthy kitchen while eating mediocre food, this place is for you."}
{"text":"Place was amazing!! They were able to accommodate our large party of 36 with very short notice!! Food was prompt and delicious!! Thank you all from the Tucson Royals softball team!!"}
{"text":"I had a fabulous time sitting at the bar on a busy Saturday. Meredith is an incredibly attentive bartender, regardless of her busy surroundings. Great beer. The food was pretty rockin'! Get the Mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"Love the beer, atmosphere and staff. On the downside, do not waste time or money on the shrimp and lobster enchiladas. There is barely any S & L in them. This after complaining to management after the first time ordering them. I was assured this was a mistake and!  they should be full of ingredients. Ordered a second time, on a different night and the same thing, only this time worse. Three enchiladas, each smaller than my thumb, one piece of shrimp, a crumble of what i assume to be lobster meat and a few small pieces of veggies. A total joke if you ask me."}
{"text":"The drive over here is a pain. The Management of this company are complete idiots for closing the Desert Ridge location. We love the food, beer and ambiance. While the aforementioned are prime motivators to come here, we mainly do so due to 1 bartender who had worked at Desert Ridge location and we got to be great friends with. Hell of a guy and damn hard worker. The old staff at the DR location were much more friendly than the staff here. They are good, dont get me wrong, but definitely not as personable."}
{"text":"Service: Excellent!!! Danielle was so great. Understood every order and request without issue, knew exactly who ordered what, knew who's separate check was who's inn a large group, came back often to check up. one of the best servers in all my experience. Request her if you can!!! She didn't even flinch at the separate checks request and she was so organized. 

Food was 4/5 stars. The side salad was excellent. The fries am with seasoning delicious. The salmon was great.

No complaints here. 

First time here, and I'd come back again and ask for Danielle!"}
{"text":"So now they've nixed the potstickers, the asiago dip, the portabella sandwich, and the fried mozz appetizers.  They also changed their fries away from the thinner variety to a more traditional & common medium thickness.  They just can't get it right, can they?

Beers are the only reason to come back.  Who knows what they'll do with the menu next?!"}
{"text":"About the same as the other locations for Rock Bottom in the Phoenix area, but this one is more convenient to a major highway (I-10).  I wish they would stop making so many menu changes, which are often for the worse.  Food has gone downhill in the last couple years, and beers are rather uninspiring.  For convenience sake I might stop here with low expectations, but if you have the time I'd advise that you seek another dining choice."}
{"text":"Rock Bottom can't make up their mind on menu offerings.  Asiago Cheese dip - on the menu for years, then they axed it in favor of new appetizers that didn't sell so well (Fried Mozz. sticks with miscellaneous accoutrements).  To make things worse, when they did this the menu designer actually had a picture of the asiago cheese dip bread on the menu as decoration, but they no longer served that bread!  After customers complained, they brought back the asiago cheese dip, but only for a limited time.  I guess the people who liked it have moved on to other restaurants, because apparently it wasn't selling and it's off the menu.

Portabello sandwich is gone too, the one thing my spouse ordered every time we went there.

Beers are average as far as brewpubs go - considerably better than Oggis a couple miles away, but not as good as BJ's or Gordon Biersch in the West Valley.

Nachos are good.  Ballpark pretzel served with queso is good as well."}
{"text":"I went to Rock Bottom with a few of my friends and i will say for a restaurant and micro-brewery my Long Island Iced Tea was sufficiently strong and was quite a treat. We were seated quickly for a Saturday night with no reservation and there didn't seem to be much of a wait, unless you had a larger group of people. We tried to call for a larger group previous to this date and there apparently is a cutoff time for calling ahead for larger groups.

Our service was very good and easy on the eyes which is always a pleasant factor when dining, considering the people who can be spotted in various North Carolina locales. Our food was fresh and nicely seasoned. I had the jambalaya which had a good amount of spiciness for a creole type dish. On the menu there were various other choices like macaroni and cheese, vegetables, pretzels for appetizers, etc. 

I will return to Rock Bottom for both food and for drinks, hopefully catching a large table before they are all taken up."}
{"text":"I've never been crazy about the food here, but my friend likes it, so I do eat here once in a while. We stopped in last night and I had the chicken finger appetizer with fries. The food was a little overcooked and nearly tasteless. The ranch dressing was barely good enough to make up for it. 

My friend had the mac & cheese with chicken and bacon, which is what she orders just about every time she's there. It looked delicious and the portion was huge. I'll be trying this dish next time we're there. 

We've also had the Ball Park Pretzels in the past, and they're really good. 

I'm giving 4 stars because the service was great, there's outdoor seating, and the Berry Bash Sangria was delicious (if expensive). We'll be back."}
{"text":"Rock Bottom on Thursday nights is the place to be. Team Trivia starts at 8pm and it is free to play. The DJ (Todd) is great. 

The food is good, but the Ball Park Pretzels with Spicy Spinach Cheese dip is the best. The wait staff is generally pleasant and on top of things, a few servers are excellent. I am not a beer drinking so I haven't tried the microbrews but the mixed drinks I've had have been good and a few of thier specials perfect. 

On nights that are not trivia nights, Rock Bottom is quiet and a good place for a small to medium party. Larger parties will usually be split into two tables. 

Overall, an enjoyable place at which I am a regular."}
{"text":"The food and beer selection here is great. Not my favorite local beers but they definitely hit the spot. It's usually pretty crowded but the wait time isn't bad if you're flexible about sitting outside. I'll be back to try more of their foods. I will say skip the macaroni and cheese - it's mostly grease and breadcrumbs."}
{"text":"Food was AMAZING! Fresh and cooked perfectly! You could tell that everything was cooked to order, my caesar dressing was defiantly home made! Service was great as well and food was reasonably priced! Will come back again on my next trip to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice now, the first time leaving with the entire meal comped because of the crappy service. Last night I went in there with eight of my family members and we had to wait 30 minutes to get a drink we had one then left . Manager didn't seem to care so I can assure you we will not be spending $300 twice a month there anymore"}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend coming here for business lunches.... especially if you only have an hour. It took way to long to take our order and even longer to get our food.  By the time it came, one person had to immediately get a to go box and the rest of us had 15 minutes to eat. 

They were not very busy but I saw the manager busing tables. Grilled chicken was tasteless and fried peppers on my salad were stone cold."}
{"text":"A decent place to have a drink while watching a game. The food, however, was not impressive. The artichoke crab dip was awful. The veggie quesadillas were ok. The waiter ignored us for a long time, and when the manager walked by, he coughed on our table. There's bound to be better places in the area."}
{"text":"My steak was perfect and the fries were wonderful! Great atmosphere and excellent service even right before they closed!! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after a field trip with my students. Great service, great staff, great food!"}
{"text":"Man, I wish this place had a view of the Cuyahoga River...if it did, it would be perfect. I wish this place was at the other end of the Powerhouse, where an ever-revolving stream of restaurants find their home...and unfortunately, that's the side with the killer view. Everything else is top notch-the beer is mind-blowing and the food is hearty. It's worth coming here just for the beer, in my opinion! I gotta start taking a Growler home when I leave--they are very reasonably priced, all things considered. Other than the view, the only thing that stinks is the parking--if you don't wanna pay for the lot on weekends, you gotta hunt and peck for a spot on the street, which can be hard to find at times...but anyway, if you're looking to grab a bite to eat before the show at the Plain Dealer Pavilion or whatever it's called these days, you won't go wrong at the Rock Bottom."}
{"text":"Here's the Deal...Just stopped in for quick bite to eat while I was in town... I had the grilled chicken sandwich with avocado and it was good!.   Service was very friendly and helpful with menu choices.  The place has nice outdoor seating & plenty of TV's and bar space... I'd try again when in the area."}
{"text":"Rock bottom is a great way to describe how you'll feel when you realize you've been waiting 45 minutes (and counting) for a cheeseburger. I can't speak for the food, but the service and environment leave much to be desired! Sorry Rock Bottom, but you're probably never going to get a second chance. Boooooo.

EDIT: the food finally came. my fries were cold and the burger was mediocre at best. I'd give it a solid 3/10 for food quality!"}
{"text":"Rock Bottom is a chain brew pub one that, in my opinion, is just \"OK\".  The restaurant is rather large with lots of seating and a pool table. They have many of their own brews that you can sample but to tell you the truth none of them are that good. I have had several of their beers and all of them have been forgettable. 

Their food is pretty much like their beers, forgettable. I have had one of their burgers and their pizza and they really weren't anything to write home about.

I feel they will impress those who have never been to a brew pub but I would probably describe them as the Chili's of Brew Pubs. If you are in homestead and are looking for a burger and a beer it might be a good choice for a bite, or at least until the Burgatory opens!"}
{"text":"A very nice brewpub - a recent and extensive renovation provides great atmosphere.  Blue cheese bacon burger was excellent.  Their brews are very well balanced and enjoyable - something on tap for everyone."}
{"text":"Best place in the area to grab a bite to eat. My family frequents this restaurant and have never been disappointed with the food, drinks, or service!"}
{"text":"This is a great  stop for a meal if your going to a Bobcat's game or any event at Time Warner arena.
They have covered garage parking for just $5 and a menu that just won't quit. They've got something for everyone.
Try the Mahi tacos, two fresh and flavorful,  crispy tacos, covered with a soft flour tortilla...the flavor screams at you...!
If it's busy, you can get a game of pool on the two billiard tables or sit at the bar and enjoy on of the many big screen plasmas. 
It's a five mimute walk to the Bobcat's and the Blue Line Lynx with easy access stop to Panthers."}
{"text":"I was able to eat on the enclosed patio with my dogs and my first drink was free. Their macaroni & cheese with chicken is so good! Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"For this occasion I was with my girls, we were looking for a place to have a good lunch.  We looked around and chose Rock Bottom, we have eaten then before and enjoyed ourselves.  The server was a very nice person and was very attentive.  She when over the specials and took our drink order.   Going through the menu one thing that caught my eye was the BBQ Brisket Stuffed Burger.  That just sounded so good.  Unfortunately the reality didn't match the idea of the burger.  The favor of the BBQ never came through and the smoked Gouda flavor was none existent. It was like having a standard old boring burger.  I was very disappointed.  For $14, I would have expected a lot more flavor.  I would not recommend this burger unless they do something to bunch up the flavor."}
{"text":"a bar chain is a bar chain is a bar chain.  Nothing really special here but nothing incredibly bad either.  burgers, beers, drunk people puking in the restroom, good drunk times for everyone.  This one seems to have a longer wait than the others in the chain ive been to and the clientèle  rowdy but if the company is right you can have an fun time here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i came here for an early dinner after our movie and we were so disappointed with the service. I have been here before and never had a problem when im sitting at bar but this particular night our waiter asked if we wanted to sit at bar or in dining room and we chose the latter. He rolled his eyes at us and proceeded to huff and puff as he took us to our table and we didn't know why! He didn't speak at all just mumbles the whole time when we were ordering. It felt like we were inconveniencing him! Never gave us refills, practically threw our foods in front of us. It was very uneasy my boyfriend and i just stayed quiet and tried to not let the attitude get to us but it really did sour the mood. I ordered the bacon cheese burger and jt was barely cooked i asked for well done and it was raw. Such a shame because we usually enjoy it here. Sade to say will not be returning."}
{"text":"To be frank, this place is so mediocre and kinda just sucks. I've tried it a few different times and I don't know how they stay in business. The food is bland and the menu just isn't impressive."}
{"text":"Visited Rock Bottom at about 4:45 on a Saturday.  Was surprised at how busy they were but we were still able to be seated quickly in a large comfortable booth overlooking the street.

I started with the Summer Honey Ale.  Meh.  I think I was expecting a bit more of a sweet/honey flavor.  I wish I had tried one of their other beers.  It comes in a large glass (I think bigger than a typical pint serving).

I had the stuffed poblano peppers.  I was curious (dubious?) so I asked my server.  She said that the filling is awesome and that the bites with the peppers had a kick.  She was spot on.  I really enjoyed the cheesey, chicken-y, chorizo-y filing.  The rice around the peppers was good too and it definitely seemed like a hearty portion.  Eventually, with sweat running down the side of my face, I scraped the remaining filling out of the second pepper and just ate it.  I enjoyed my pepper bites but was ready to stop the heat.

Our group shared some of the ice cream sandwiches.  Childish?  Yes.  Tasty?  Surely.  The plate comes with three ice cream sandwiches made with chocolate chip cookies, some strawberries, and a bowl of chocolate sauce.  My only wish was that the cookies were a bit softer.  In texture and look, they were over done with just lent additional difficulty to eating the messy treat.

Our server was very good and took excellent care of us."}
{"text":"Solid beer options with a frozen bar to keep em cool on. Also, they offer what is maybe the most generous beer flight I've ever seen.
Service is great. The bartenders are helpful and attentive, and can guide you in the right direction with said flight."}
