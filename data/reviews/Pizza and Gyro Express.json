{"text":"When they are busy they don't deliver to liberty Boro. Douche bags. Guess I will order from someone else."}
{"text":"This WAS one of a our favorite pizza places. We don't even live in the area and would go monthly if not more. We will never return after our experience tonight! When we got our pizza we didn't like it. We asked the waitress if we could get a different one and we were told no. Since nothing was \"wrong\" with it we would even still have to pay for it!. After paying over $50 for pizza we didn't eat I asked to speak with whoever made the decision to not take care of us. He gave me a mediocre sorry and said he could take 50% off. Its not about the money sir its about the experience. Terrible way to run your business"}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed the pizza and Gyro's. Homemade Gyro's from a spit not frozen. Great service! Very friendly and accommodating to children. Prices are reasonable. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Their hoagies are HUGE! My favorite thing to order (the 1/2 is more than enough). They also have great french fries and onion petals. Their pizza is not bad...but with the delivery fee it's pricey. Ironically the gyro is my least favorite menu item. It was so stuffed that I could hardly pick it up to eat it and the meat wasn't seasoned so well."}
{"text":"I can only comment on the gyro (large size).  I am soooo addicted, I love, love, love the cucumber sauce - nice and garlicky, and the gyro meat is sliced just right (not too thick) and very generous. I may try the extra large if I am extra hungry! In my two recent visits, I have received friendly and fast service.  I really want to visit the lunch buffet - maybe soon when my schedule permits."}
{"text":"Someone brought me a pretty damn strong half-hoagie from PaGE this evening. The meat was sufficient, the veggies were fresh,  the bread tasted to be newly baked, the house dressing possessed snap, and it was nine inches long! A whole hoagie is 18! 

PaGE also offers fried chicken, sliced-from-the-spit gyros, pulled pork, meatloaf, wedgies, shrimp scampi (!), onion petals (hell yes!), whole wings (with drumette and flat intact), and a 24-cut Goliath pie! We're dealing with a pizza joint that differs a little bit from the norm. 

Now I have another excuse to visit my sister in McKeesport."}
