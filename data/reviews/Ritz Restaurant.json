{"text":"I come here for breakfast on occasion, with family and friends, the eggs bennie is very good. There is only one server, probably the owner so it can be slow. Especially if she if feeding large family groups of which seem to happen here. I've had to get up and get my own coffee but not a big deal really. There was a big family in this morning with about 4-5 children, and a couple of those kids were completely out of hand. Screaming, jumping on the benches, parents oblivious to the amount of noise. So just be prepared because we've encountered this before.  The food is tasty and even though the decor is in need of a refresh, it can be a good place to go if you happen to get there on a quiet day."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch/breakfast with a group of eight. Seven of us enjoyed - and I mean ENJOYED - the Filipino breakfast consisting of rice, salad, two fried eggs, and authentic Filipino meat (choice of thinly sliced marinated beef; sweet pork sausages; or fried marinated fish) for $6, including coffee. Hard to beat, both in price and flavor. The diner-style restaurant is run by a family, who provide very friendly service. The atmosphere is great, a real neighborhood gem, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is a local East York diner with great basic breakfast fare as well as Filipino menu items.  We went today for brunch and loved it.  We stuck with the basic diner fare but will return to try some other items soon.  The food is very fresh, service is friendly and the prices are reasonable.  Portions are just right...not too big.  We had pancakes and bacon (my son at everything on his plate), the western omelette and the a veggie omelette with rosti potato.  Everything was fresh, tasty and served hot.  The rosti potato was particularly good.  Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"A great little gem of a cafe. Friendly service and reasonably priced. The Ritz is clean and well kept. I will be coming back to try more of the delicious foods."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite place in Toronto for breakfast, although the whole menu is very good. I think I've likely been there more than a hundred times over the years and never had a bad meal. It's really inexpensive and has excellent food. I strongly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"I give this place a solid 4.5 stars.  You need to set your expectations when coming here.  You are not going to get high end, gourmet food; you are getting a fast greasy spoon breakfast.  I got the traditional Filipino breakfast with the sliced beef, the beef was really good, the rice was tasty, however, the eggs (over easy) were slightly overcooked but this is something that I have come to live with when getting breakfast. For $6 plus tax and tip you get meat (sliced beef, fried fish, or sausage), a little bit of lettuce with dressing, garlic rice, and a drink (coffee, tea, or juice); definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch, had the chicken Bombay and the chicken and pork adobo.

The food was amazing, so flavourful, fresh and filling. The service was great. 

We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great breakfast that hits the right spot! Got the filipino beef breakfast and fish; great flavors, and great value for price -$8!"}
{"text":"This tiny restaurant has the look and feel of a typical diner...with a difference. It has a Filipino flavour.

We scheduled this into our \"Spoon Tour\" because it has a standard diner breakfast...which most of us had. The adventurous one in our group ordered one of the 3 \"Filipino Breakfast Specials\". Our friend had the sliced beef (which came with a vinegar dip). There was also a pork sausage, and fish version. All came with garlic rice and 2 fried eggs. He found it very tasty.

The standard breakfasts were, well...standard. 3 small eggs, home fries (that were really French fries sliced like HFs) and regular \"Wonder-type\" toast. The coffee was ok.

At 4.95 for the Canadian breakfast special - I think the Filipino version was 5.95 - you could hardly go wrong."}
{"text":"One of the hidden gems in the neighborhood. Love all their breakfast options. Try Filipino breakfast."}
{"text":"Family run business - friendly, weekend brunch is busy with just one server who keeps a smile on her face throughout. Love the Filipino breakfast options as well as their potato rosti! Small place with limited seating, not good for big groups."}
{"text":"The Ritz is my favorite breakfast spot near the Danforth. I live 15 minutes away and go when ever I get a chance. I order the Filipino breakfast called Lonsilog. It is a sweet fryed Filipino sausage served with eggs, salad and garlic rice. Very delicious and healthy. The lunch menu is classic continental.  Very reasonalbly priced in a retro atmosphere.

{"text":"This quaint little retro diner is run by a nice filipino couple.  They serve pretty much diner food plus some comfort foods from the Philippines.  I wasn't here for their kare kare, adobo or tapsilog beef.  I have my go to filipino place on Lawrence East when I'm feeling that.  No, I wanted straight old fashion Eggs Benedict. Seeing some of the pictures on yelp just made my mouth water. 

When my Eggs Benedict with peameal bacon arrived, it looked just like some of the pictures I had seen earlier.  I quickly cut into the poached egg but was surprised at how watery the yolk was.  I've never seen that happen.  Usually it's a gooey runny yolk that slowly oozes out when cutting into it.  Well I'm sure it will taste fine either way so when I took that first bite of the egg, peameal, english muffin & hollandaise, there was not much taste to it at all.  I added some salt & pepper which kind of made it okayish.  I've definitely had better.  It's too bad because I really like supporting small family run businesses.  Maybe I'll come back & try some of their filipino dishes instead but I will pass on their coffee. Instant tastes better than theirs."}
{"text":"How does this place have four stars????

The chairs are duck taped, the floor dirty, and this is what the customers see. I can only imagine the kitchen. Honestly nothing special about the food.  A lot of the food does not taste fresh.

You can make all their food at home. 

Save your money and don't go."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch today and the ambiance was very old school-home like. It was very nice! Family owned. 

Pros:
Good portions for the price 
Clean 
Good service 

Cons:
None"}
{"text":"Such a charming little spot, which does seem a bit run down, but! I guess that's what gives this place its appeal in some way. It seems more retro and very old-school if anything, with its 1970's milkshake machines and its dated radio which seemed to still work surprisingly, and jukebox machines that they had at each table - for display only!

The Filipina server I assumed was one of the owners, and she was very friendly and helpful with portion suggestions, and told us that most items are good enough for 1 person. We had the lumpia, and the kare kare with steamed rice on the side. For dessert, a leche flan. Overall, everything was pretty decent! The bok choy was definitely fresh and the peanut butter sauce was reminiscent to that of Max's in Vaughan I will say bc it's more on the peanut buttery side.

I enjoyed our dine in experience here and would recommend it to people who just want something simple and modest."}
{"text":"Kinda love the breakfast here.  Looks like an old school diner right down to the milkshake mixer.   I will drink your milkshake!
When here, you must do the Filipino breakfast.  A little greens with a light dressing, a couple of eggs that are never too greasy, fried rice and sausages.  It's all about the sausages.  They are fan fucking tastic.  
Service is also great.  The woman is beyond nice, quick, and all you expect from a diner and more."}
{"text":"There's always only one server on a busy weekend brunch that makes the service really really slow. Couldnt even order because there was a backup of even order taking.

I am not sure why they dont hire more staff. Its also big turn off when you cant even find the server because shes so busy at the back trying to get everything done. 

Bewary of this place during weekend and prepare to wait for awhile."}
{"text":"Love eating the longsilog breakfasts here, so so so yummy! The garlic rice goes perfectly with the meat and dipping the longanisa into their homemade vinegar sauce makes for a great combination."}
{"text":"This little Filipino restaurant sits at the tail end of a series of businesses that occupy 
Donlands and Cosburn.  The restaurant offers your typical diner food as well home cooked Filipino food.   The food is better than fast food but don't expect Michelin star quality.  The restaurant looks like it has not been redecorated since it originally opened up the sixties.  But what it lacks in d√©cor it makes up for in mass quantities is service and charm.  As soon as you walk in, you can see the owner's children playing with their friends and neighborhood regulars having conversations with the owner.  I had the traditional Filipino breakfast dish Silog and ML had Beef-Chicken Abodo.  Both dishes were evenly seasoned and cooked. I will definitely return here at least on a monthly basis for the pleasant service and the cozy feel of this local joint. (the pictures are not from the restaurant since I forgot to take them, but this is pretty close to how it looks)"}
{"text":"I checked this place out on the way home from yoga - cause nothing makes me happier than messing up some good workout with some greasy breakfast! Let me tell you that on first glance I thought with a name like Ritz that it was going to be a Jewish diner. Never did I think that it was going to be a Filipino resto with pretty good reviews from papers (posted proudly in their window).

I ended up getting the traditional Filipino breakfast with beef and it was mighty tasty despite the fact that I didn't really feel like I was eating breakfast. But it was good and a great price. My friend had the bacon and egg combo and was quite happy with it too. The only thing is I'm not sure if yoga made me extra hungry (all that corpse pose really gets me in the mood for eatin) but I felt like there could have been more on my plate. 

Oh also - if you're bringing a stroller bring a buddy because you arent getting into those double doors without a struggle otherwise. I was caught in the middle at one point and almost asked to just be served in the corridor."}
{"text":"I went there with friends' recommendation. I ordered adobo - meat (chiken and pork) was juicy and tender yet crispy outside. Sause was tasty and side vegetables were perfectly cooked. It was delicious, with good price and good service. It made me feel I want to keep this little gem as a secret, I want it to be staying in the neighbourhood.
I'm rating 4-star as this was my first visit. I'll be back to try different food to get to know Ritz better."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch one day because my barber said they make a killer Bombay Curry Chicken...that they do indeed!

$10 got me steamed rice, steam veggies, and some spicy ass Bombay chicken.  You can request how hot you want it and I chose medium-hot.  Now I eat spicy food but medium-hot had me sweating...a lot!

I'd come back and check out their breakfast."}
{"text":"Delicious Filipino breakfast! The service was friendly and fast. Highly recommended! Will revisit again."}
{"text":"$10 got me beef, egg and garlic rice. It was totally worth it. 

Tip
- call 3 days ahead if you want to order purple yam cake. I love that dessert so very much! I wanna go back.. 

- home made. you can taste it. 

- try any dish wi/garlic rice because its just so good."}
{"text":"Excellent neighbourhood diner.  Family-run, home cooking, proud of what they serve.  House-made home fries with your breakfast, fresh vegetables with your dinner.  None of the usual mass-prepared frozen food-service ingredients so many small restaurants seem to lean on. 

The Ritz has a good selection of the traditional  diner staples, plus some nice home-cooked Filipino specialties as a bonus.  Despite a somewhat out-of-the-way location they're usually fairly busy, often with regulars who travel across town for this gem.  Wonderful friendly service. Very inexpensive.  Definitely worth a visit if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! I love the breakfast in this homely neighbourhood diner! If coffee taste little better, I may come here more often!"}
{"text":"This place is the best. Hidden gem for sure. With Filipino sausages longanisa.  Sooo good. Each booth has it's own juke box"}
{"text":"Party of 1, weekday lunch.

Tasty home-cooked chicken and pork adobo with rice and steamed vegetables.

Seating area's not too big, and is nicely decorated with restaurant equipment from another era. The countertop needed a wipe-down though - there was only one person taking care of the store and she was quite busy taking orders, cleaning tables, accepting payments, etc. But she still managed to stop by and check to make sure that I was enjoying my food (I certainly was!).

The food is on the greasy side. The chicken and pork ribs adobo with rice & assorted vegetables came with an excellent amount of sauce and grilled onions. The rice was soft and mixing the meat, rice, sauce and veggies together made for a delicious combo!

Would come here again without a doubt. Especially since I've now seen the picture of the smoked salmon eggs benedict on yelp! :)

No wifi."}
{"text":"What a freaking gem! Cheap, clean, tasty as hell. Why haven't I discovered philippino breakfast before? I got the beef with two eggs, garlic rice, small green salad and coffee - for $10. And it was so good! The garlic rice was strong enough to repel vampires, but so damn tasty! The eggs were cooked perfectly and it came with a homemade vinegar sauce for the beef. It was really, really good. My bestie's egg breakfast was also reasonable, yummy and super affordable.

The room is quaint and has an awesome retro vibe. The service was on the relaxed/slower side, but all the service and bussing was done by one woman, who was busy but still really friendly and cheerful. It's clearly a family run place that's an obvious labour of love. She also talked us into dessert- a lovely flan with caramel sauce. It was perfect for two people to share, and really tasty. I would eat here again in a heart beat. And you should too!"}
{"text":"This family-run restaurant has been in the neighborhood for about a dozen years. They have North American breakfast but i recomend the delicious Philippine breakfast. They also have an array of tasty lunches Curry, salmon, steak, adobo. It is small and closes fairly early so I think of it more as a lunch n breakfast place. They keep the price very reasonable."}
