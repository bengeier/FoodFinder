{"text":"Ok for starters..... My girlfriend and I have been eating at this pizza joint for a little while now, and we really did enjoy the food.

HOWEVER; One night we order pizza for a party that we were having. Online it told us that we would receive our pizza at 1:15. We waited and waited until it finally hit 1:30. We then started to call the business to see where our order was. But to no avail, because no one ever answered the phone. BTW I was still charged for the food.

So the next day I called the store at 11AM (an hour after advertised opening time) and again, no one answered. I then called again that same day at 4PM and asked for a manager. The manager told me that \"They are short employees on Monday nights\" and that he saw my order in the morning and was going to void it out for me. \

Now me also working in the food business, I decided not to give the guy a hard time. 

But today. (3 days later) I checked my account and found that the charge still went thru!
So again I called them today at 12AM and again NO ANSWER. I even went as far as to call the pluming store that is right next to Oliveos and they told me that no one was there and that I should waste my time coming down in person to complain.....

So here I am $20.88 Short, with no fricking pizza and no refund.

Hopefully the owner sees this and messages me so I can tell him how to run a business.

p.s. My father owns a pizza joint & the key to a successful business IS STICKING TO YOUR OPERATING HOURS!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Well ordered a pizza from here just a simple 2 topping with some wings.  They said it would be 30-45 min. After an hour went by they finally showed up, driver said they had forgot the wings, pizza was not hot anymore and delivery driver made me tip him by claiming he only had a certain amount of change.  

A very mediocre pizza place that would never recommend or ever order from or eat at again."}
{"text":"So this place use to be awesome. Well at least I remember it being awesome. I remember the pizza was better and I remember the Greek fries were hella awesome. It's not so awesome anymore. I had the fries recently and they kind sucked, I was super disappointed. It was too cheesy, the dressing that it comes with didn't have the flavor it had. The fries left me feeling wanting. And to think, I used a cheat day on those fries makes me feel worse lol."}
{"text":"Welp, get ready to regret your choice a few hours later when you have a stomach ache.

This place is definitely in the category of \"fast food pizza.\" Nothing more and anything less is probably literally inedible.

I used to work at a pizza joint that made pies that tasted exactly like these; thinking they're one of many who get their ingredients from a certain large distributor. That said, the cheese is tasteless (if you make the mistake of ordering here, take some off and taste it- definitely not worth the calorie investment!), the toppings are low quality (ground meat posing as gyro meat? Tiny specks of goat cheese passing as a fully-topped pizza?), and the pizza is greasy to boot.

I don't care if you're too poor to order elsewhere, go to the store and buy ingredients to make a pizza at home before going this route. Unless you're piss drunk or a masochist, you'll thank me.

At least the staff is nice, I guess."}
{"text":"Left a flyer on my door but you don't even deliver here. Idiots .... I will now never recommend you and never order from you. I might not be so upset if the guy answering the phone wasn't rude. I will be sure to let everyone know about this horrible place."}
{"text":"Stayed overnight in Phoenix ordered pizza and salad from oliveo's and was delivered to our hotel across street very  quick. Good pizza, Greek salad was good no olives like on menu but other than good"}
{"text":"I have ordered oliveos pizza quite a bit in the past. The owner is a very cool person but the delivery staff is unbelievable. I ordered a pizza at 11pm and I called to ask eta at 12am and he said the driver had just left. He arrived at 1230am. When I asked the delivery driver... very politely... if the food was cold. He copped a very rude attitude. The total was 13.00 and I asked for 5 back. He once again was rude and didn't notice the 1 dollar i pulled out of my wallet to hand him (which is a very generous 3 dollar tip) I usually don't like to report bad service and this is my first posting on yelp but in my opinion the service is just as... if not more important than the food. I will be picking up from now on..."}
{"text":"I had a coupon so I decided to give this pizza joint a try. I didn't end up using any of the coupons/specials they offered as it didn't fit what I wanted; also, I was originally going to have it delivered but was turned off by the $4.50 delivery fee (yikes - that's more than the garlic knots I was going to get!). I ended up getting the deluxe and substituting the mushrooms for olives (they actually followed through - which was great as many places ignore the notes section). The pizza was great - good flavor but the sauce was a bit sweet. It was delicious though and FYI, its STILL good the day after :) The garlic knots were ok and made immensely better by the garlic butter they provided mmmm..."}
{"text":"I've used Grubhub a couple times and ordered from Oliveo. My experience tonight will be my last. 

The driver apparently didn't realize where I lived, and called me... four times to have me help him find my residence. Sure, it's dark. Sure it's a little rainy. But to not find an address that 1) they've been to several times before and 2) has been here since the 70s boggles my mind. His professionalism was non existent as I carefully explained how to  get to my residence. Having just had back surgery I couldn't get up well and out to curb. Lovely right?

Then to top it off my order was wrong - incorrect dessert included and I called specifically to have something added to the order, it wasn't included either. 

Sure, late night muchies and location being what it is I could see some Tempe folks loving this place. But for anyone else I would just skip. Unprofessional staff, lack of attention to detail and waste of money."}
{"text":"I really like this place! Hours are GREAT for late night food and the prices are reasonable. The wings are really good, the pasta is a ridiculously large portion, the pizzas are decent and the greek fries are awesome. I wish the pasta had a little more complex flavor, but it is really good &, like I said, generous portions! (about two meals worth each). The pizza can go either way for me, but one thing worth ordering if you like spicy is the Sriacha pizza!!!! It was freakin' amazing! Just enough Sriacha, but not so much it makes you cringe...a great balance. I would probably order it without green pepper next time 'cause it really doesn't add to it for me. I really like this place & it's definitely worth a try! (Not really a sit-down type place, more of a delivery storefront)"}
{"text":"From past experiences this joint has stepped It's game up. 

Cashiers are usually friendly and willing to accommodate simple requests. Pizza is fairly good sooooo......don't knock it till you've tried it.

Hell,..its better than some frozen dough shit from pizza hut. Way better. Their pineapple bacon is a personal favorite. So if you're looking for a late night pizza that's fresh and not expensive at all...

Fuckin oliveos man."}
{"text":"Great hours, straight forward staff, no frills store front, rich & tasty pizzas.
I am not a fan of the crust, my personal interest, so \"Yay, I'm a fan\" is my subjective Rating.

(I have not ordered \"Delivery\" for 15 years; I always show up 5-10 min early, check the places out, and walk away with Steaming Pizza!)"}
{"text":"Food is always great here, we love the greek fries and the cheesesteaks!  The price is always great here.  I always use Grub Hub, it keeps our delivery timing up to date.  The only reason why I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because their delivery timing is so up in the air.  Sometimes its right on, sometimes its 2.5 hours... overall its a great place. Would recommend."}
{"text":"I wish I could say that waiting over two hours for my pizza to get here only made it more delicious. But it didn't. As a matter of fact, when I finally got the pizza, the cheese was cold. Which was disheartening, since I did ask the driver if my pizza was still warm, and he said, \"Well, it's not COLD.\"
No, no it was definitely cold. But can I blame Oliveo Pizza for the fact that their drivers were never effectively taught the difference between hot and cold? Or should I have told him that when I say I live on Farmer Avenue it means I DON'T live on Ash Avenue? Poor kid. It's okay, though, I left him a tip just in case he might want to use it to go to school one day. 

Although, I am not one who enjoys receiving the short end of the stick. After all, I did eventually give up on the pizza coming at all and just ordered something from Dominoes. And I'd like to say that ordering two pizzas in one night isn't exactly ladylike behavior.
So, after talking to a manager over the phone, he agreed to give me a free pizza. You know, a hot one. If it could ever find it's way to my house.
But just as the conversation was ending, he asked me if he could make a suggestion, which I was truly not interested in hearing. He suggested anyway, \"MAYBE WHEN YOU ORDER A PIZZA YOU SHOULD STAY BY YOUR PHONE.\"
So to all of you: Giving Oliveo your correct address and being patient isn't quite enough for a delivery driver to make it to your house.

Hit me up if you want a free pizza from somewhere that doesn't appreciate customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"Pizza was gross (had puddles of grease sitting on top-more than a typical pizza). Delivery service was fast but that was probably because I live across the street. I have also tried one of their sandwiches and their parmesan fries...they were actually pretty good! This is why I give them 3 stars."}
{"text":"Terrible, unaccommodating customer service. Since when does a pizza place not split a pizza--half one type, and half another. I've NEVER heard of this preposterous \"rule.\" Well, Oliveo's enforces that. I've ordered numerous times and picked up. I've split pizzas--half and half. But, this time, somebody that picked up the phone decided it was the day to implement this rule. Ironically, the pizza here is very good, but we were effectively turned away...boo, hiss!"}
{"text":"Had a menu left at my door and was curious how this place was.  Read the reviews on here and figured I would give it a shot since so many people said it was good.  It was average at best.  I have absolutely no idea what people are raving about.  

I ordered a pizza with pepperoni and pineapple and some wings.  The pizza was bland and the wings were average.  I feel bad for you guys who think this place has GREAT pizza.  You've clearly never had GREAT pizza before.

I doubt I would order from here again.  I know a few places that are much better."}
{"text":"The garlic knots aren't even garlic they're bread knots slathered in butter and the pizza is super soggy. WORST PIZZA EVER IT EVEN WORSE THEN PIZZA HUT!"}
{"text":"While there pizza is good they give the most terrible service about 40% of the time. I've tried calling like 10 times within the past hour and no one answered each time. I should've given up after the 1st couple calls but I was really craving their pizza but Oliveo must really crave loosing customers. I understand it's lunch time and probably busy but that's no excuse to not at least answer and ask me to please hold."}
{"text":"12'' one-topping for $5 plus change. Thumbs up on price.
Cheesy pizza with flavorful sauce and ample toppings. Thumbs up on the pizza.
Thumbs down on seating (couple tables outside, a few bar stools inside)
Thumbs down on location. It's in the same strip as an adult video store... c'mon, that's like sleaze central.

If you're looking for great pizza at a great price and can get in and out quick, definitely check out Oliveo, just don't plan on sticking around too long.

P.S. Usually the pizza is awesome, but I've had more than one visit here where I end up wondering 'who the hell made this and what were they making?' It looks like a pizza but sure doesn't taste like one. Overall though, the good experiences far outweigh the bad and you can't beat the price in all of Tempe."}
{"text":"The Vegetarian Sub has got to be one of my favorites. It has the perfect amount of eggplant and avocados, I personally like to add garlic which gives it a little extra taste. The bun itself is delicious, imagine adding all these toppings inside of it. The customer service is wonderful, they grant all my wishes :))) Just talking about it, makes me want some!!!"}
{"text":"One of the few places that deliver late. The pizza is just okay (they even offer a cheap one topping $5 pizza), but the chicken wings are surprisingly good -- nice chicken meat to bone ratio. The delivery guys are always cool too. I've never had a problem with the food or service."}
{"text":"Drunken review:
Just played a show down the road and stoked to have been told about this place.. Brandon and Aaron served us some tasty fries while we were waiting for our $5.99 special pizza. I think we defaced some dollar bills for their wall and would have preferred to have left as a tip. Awesome late night post gig spot. 
My sober roadie gave thumbs up too"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place. Food is great and priced well. I have eaten here hundreds of times in last few years. The owners are really cool and when around will usually chat with you. Very small place so only a small bar inside and few tables outside but still nice to sit and eat if not too busy and weather is nice. Do not get here as often anymore since I live across town but will make a special trip over when I can."}
{"text":"Love the pizza and the pricing is great. It's quick and easy for pick up. Delivery could be a little better but other than that I order from here all the time. It's good any time you need a quick meal to for dinner or a party. The Greek fries and wings are delicious and the food is always hot when you get it."}
{"text":"This pizza is ok if you're super hungry, but if you have the time and energy to get better pizza, I would recommend it. I remember eating this and being really underwhelmed, but it wasn't the end of the world. If you want cheap decent pizza, go to Hungry Howie's on Hayden & Thomas."}
{"text":"Got the Deluxe pizza and a meatball sub.  The sub is not what is pictured on their website.  They do not put whole meatballs in the sub instead you get 2 1/3 meatballs.  2 very small meatballs are sliced in half and a tiny slice of another to fill the long toasted hot dog bun like \"sub\" .  My husband just picked up the $6 sandwich and said wow that is one tiny little sub.  Ya it was!  Wow not even subway would jack you like that.  The bread had turned into a paste like substance just like a hot dog bun soaked in water.  Ate the meatballs that were not very tasty at all and threw out the rest.  The deluxe pizza was good though.  Not the best dough but we are not really into fattening dough anyway.  I actually liked the pizza better than pizza hut but they get 2 stars cuz the quality of the rest of the order was pretty cheap and awful."}
{"text":"this place is located right across the street from my apartment complex and after driving by it daily, my friend and i finally decided to give it a chance last night. We could not be more impressed. the pizza was delicious, the prices were affordable and we were even named their facebook fans of the week! Will definitely go back and recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"This place has got the specials!!! and their supreme is on point. crust is fluffy, and the staff has got 'tude, which is essential in order to be a new york style pizzeria. great place for pizza!"}
{"text":"Average wait time for delivery is an unsympathetic hour, even around 2 in the afternoon. Their new website's ordering system charges you additional fees for usage. The pizza is decent, but it's not worth the headache."}
{"text":"My new favorite local pizza joint! I LOVE that Oliveo stays open so late (until 3:30am Mon-Sat, and 1:30am on Sundays) and the late-night specials are great. Low prices, awesome hours, and great food-- I couldn't ask for anything more!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Work in the neighborhood and was pleasantly pleased with the pizza and salad. We have used the delivery option as well and it was timely and food was fresh. Recommend for sure!"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service, deals, delivery time, pizza and wings! 
I found Oliveo on here hoping to find a place that was different from the pizza chains that we usually order from.
First of all when I called I couldn't believe how quiet the background was when I was placing my order. Usually I prefer to order online because of the noise on the other end of the phone. Secondly, the guy who took my order was very nice. He said about 35-45 minutes. I think it took about 35 minutes for the pizza's and wings to get here. The delivery guy was very nice and wasn't into the usual chit-chat that other delivery guys seem to do. He had a job to do and he did it well. I hate when I am starving and the guy wants to talk.
The pizza's looked and smelled awesome - and tasted even better. I ordered the wings well done and they were PERFECT! If I could ding them on one teeny thing it would be the ranch dressing. We got plenty of it but I like the creamy ranch, not the glossy kind. That probably doesn't make sense to some, but I know the difference. It was still very good though, it's just a preference.
If you are looking for some really, really good pizza and wings - this is the place! Give it a try, you'll be back. Well, at least I know we will be back. :)"}
{"text":"Real Frikkin Pizza, Just delicious!!! fast friendly and at a great price . It's down the street and they deliver. nice to have a REAL pizza joint nearby"}
{"text":"Yelping about a business as you eat their food, doesn't get any better.

Call was answered promptly and the guy was very nice and efficient. 

12\" comes with chicken and onions, and an order of 8 wings.  I will preface this by stating that I am a pizza and wing connoisseur; so much so that my mom told me on several occasions that I'm going to start growing feathers soon.  DISCLAIMER:  I have no affiliations to any special interest groups of nearby competitors ;)

I dive into the wings immediately ensuring the golden sauce was not forgotten, yes..the blue cheese. Check.  I greedily eat one of the wings after dunking it in the BC with the appropriate 180 oscillating revolutionary turn.  As I picked it up, it dripped like a faucet with a bad seal, that or as though someone walked by the container of BC and spilled some water in the mother container and they just mixed it in. Thus, the consistency was definitely amiss!  Taste was decent.  The wing flavor had an greasy like taste to it, not bad, but not great.  Hot sauce was not that hot, but I have a high tolerance for hot (BWW, Geno's and Tessios all much hotter).  Size was medium.  Cooked appropriately.  

The pizza was decent.  as another viewer mentioned, it's about equivalent to Little Caesars, although, I think it's a little better.  I do like the crust.  It reheats well.  

If it's late night, and no place was open, and I had my own THICK blue cheese, I would order again.  But other than that scenario, I won't be.  It will definitely fix the gluttonous tendencies of us evil consumers here in America, especially if you are drunk.  My recommendation to the owners is improve on the dressing, and make a hotter sauce.  Two simple adjustments that I think may keep more customers."}
{"text":"Four reasons for four stars:

1. The staff: Great group of guys (and gals) that are friendly, down to earth, genuine people when they help you. They're not fake friendly either!
2. Open til 3am. After late nights at work it's the perfect RELIABLE spot. Not to mention 2:45 after the bars. Just make sure to tip when you stumble in at 2:45, remember they put up with you every time.
3. The chicken pesto sandwich is amazing! Enough said.
4. They have coupons / deals everyday, you hardly ever have to pay full price but always get 110% quality.

Will get five stars when I find a fifth reason"}
{"text":"The pizza, salads and Greek fries are amazing and always consistent.  Delivery is always timely and courteous.  The only place we order pizza from.  A must try if you want really good food!"}
{"text":"The pizza isn't the best, the crust was the real winner.  I was able to sample both the pepperoni and chicken bruschetta pizzas - I think the pepperoni was the winner.  The chicken bruschetta has almost too many toppings, making it difficult to eat without a knife and fork.  The crust on the pepperoni pizza was light, crisp, and tasted very fresh."}
{"text":"we had a friend over and although we were stuffed from the Devoured festival, he hadn't eaten. we had a coupon for Oliveo and thought, \"hell, we can always eat pizza\". 

i thought the pizza was good. with the unlimited toppings coupon, among others, i opted for extra mozzarella. the pizza was nice, gooey, and a tad salty, just how i like it. there weren't many other veggies on there, considering i ordered tomatoes, basil, peppers, pretty much every veggie option. 

overall, i thought the pizza was pretty good. i like crusts that are a little more crispy though."}
{"text":"While their food is fantastic, their delivery time is ABSOLUTELY atrocious! I have waited up to TWO HOURS for food after ordering (and this is in the middle of the day, not crazy weird late hours).  They send out emails when the food goes out and I have waited an HOUR after that email to receive my food.  Seems like they have enough well-trained chefs to make the good food, but man, please get more drivers...  I've ordered many times from this location but this may be my last time.  Still waiting for my food after ordering 1:25pm and receiving notification that my food was prepared and being delivered at 2:23pm (it's now 3:10pm). Can't wait to see how warm my food will be or if it's all going to be soggy and cold."}
{"text":"First things first, I drive all the over from North Phoenix to get their Hawaiian BBQ Pizza and Greek Fries, you can never go wrong with this combination. Make sure you ask for extra lemon sauce for the Greek fries. This pizza joint has always been amazing and fresh. I have never had a deliver from here but every time I have had a pick up order it's been perfect. It's not really meant for dine in as it does not have much seating."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza in Tempe. Hole in the wall with tons of character. You can't eat in, but to be honest, you probably wouldn't want to. 

There's a theory floating around out there that the best pizza comes from the grossest-looking places, and this is no exception. Definitely a must-try. 

Get the white pizza. Also, the sauce is house-made and TO DIE FOR!"}

Summary: Pizza driver baked more than Pizza was!  Pizza delivered 2 hours late!

My friend and I were staying up late Sunday night so we could catch up as she was visting from out of town.  She suggested pizza so everyone else being closed at 11 p.m., I decided to try Oliveo's as I had a flyer from them....

So at 11:15 p.m. we ordered our pizza.  They told us it would be 45 minutes, a standard amount of time for a delivery.

We were pretty hungry, but we also hadn't seen each other for a long time and got engrossed in conversation.  So about 12:30 we both realize that the pizza hasn't gotten there yet.  So at 12:35, according to my phone, I called Oliveo's to find out what was going on.  I got a pretty grumpy person who informed me they were short staffed with only two people and that my pizza was on its way but he couldn't really tell me when I would get it.

About 12:37, the driver, who sounded pretty stoned in my opinion, called and told me he was sorry to inform me that my pizza was going to be 15 minutes late.  So i said drive safely, but we are starving!  He told me that there was one house ahead of mine and explained they only had two people working and they had \"run out of pizza\".  WTF, LOL... he he the pizza place RAN OUT OF PIZZA... lol... that cracked us up.

About 1:30 a.m.  he finally arrived and gave us a cold pizza and our pasta we ordered.  So the order was \"only\" two hours late.  After he left my friend and I burst out laughing our **sses off because the driver WAS FULLY BAKED.  No, really his EYES were like LARGER than his head.  We hadn't seen any one that stoned for quite some time, ourselves having changed our own wild ways some time back....

The pizza was cold but tasty and the pasta was rather tasty too, but in all honesty I can never order from this place again, sadly.  2 hours late is WAY too late, the first guy I talked to on the phone was short with me and unpolite, the stoned driver was very easy going (lol) but no one offered us any rebate of cost or coupons or anything to make up for this extraordinarily bad customer service.  

I would generalyl call the place during the day to talk to them about it, but we were busy having one last little bit of time together before i took her to the airport and now my work week started, so sorry to yelp you without calling you Oliveo's, but really, in my opinion this was so poor that I feel fine about not really giving you prior warning of my poor review.  

Also how can you \"run out of pizza\"... (still lmao!)"}
{"text":"I ordered off of uber eats the white pizza. Nothing was wrong with uber eats. However this pizza was terrible. Loaded with onions, no ricotta and all \"mozzarella\" and no add on to Pineapple other than three pieces. It was like dominos with onion breath. Also they promised marinera sauce on the side, but didn't receive that either. It's too bad."}
{"text":"Great pizza!!!! We order through the GrubHub app or pick up. The Capprese pizza is just wonderful. Fresh tomato slices with pesto and cheese, just wonderful. Great portions and prices. These guys know what they're doing."}
{"text":"Ordered twice for here while in town.  Pizza is amazing!!  Delivery service was fast!  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First off it was a tie between 3 stars and 4, but......

I got a 12\" pizza with gyro meat, feta, and onions. $5 dollar special, worth the price.

Overall I thought the pizza was quite good. DEFINITELY not great or awesome. Better than Hungry Howies,  ehhhh, maybe a tie with the Little Caesars on Rural & Broadway(best little caesars). Not as good as Papa John's, but I think the crust & toppings was why. Crust seemed a little flat. It tasted really good and had lots of cheese, but the toppings were a little lacking, just not enough. And again, I don't know why it's so hard to evenly spread toppings! I mean come on. It only takes a few more seconds to nicely spread them instead of just throwing them on there.

I will go back and maybe try one of the specialty pizzas and see how that goes.

Wings, I don't know. Too expensive. Wings should be cheaper. There are places they are quite a bit cheaper and good.

Hum.....about time time for some more pizza."}
{"text":"Yuck. Terrible pizza. If I want bad cheap pizza, I'll go to Little Caesars. There is nothing special about this place, other than it makes pizza... Just like everyone else."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza and a 2 liter of soda. After over an hour of waiting (which I realize happens in this business) the driver showed up without the soda. He said he would be right back. However, a half hour went by and he still wasn't back with the soda. I called the restaurant and was immediately placed on hold (also is fine on a busy night). When the employee came back on the phone, he said his driver was just leaving. He did not sound sympathetic, in fact a little apathetic, and didn't offer a discount or a credit on a future order. I would not recommend this place. They don't seem very reliable and for a $4.50 delivery charge, I'd expect a little more reliability and better service. My advice would be to take your business elsewhere. There are many other options in the area."}
{"text":"I have been frequenting Oliveo Pizza since I started college--I graduated three years ago, and am still a loyal customer! There's a reason they don't get five stars, only four...but we will get to that.

First, the food is amaaaziiiing! The Greek Fries are (almost) literally orgasmic! I always order extra lemon sauce. Seriously, it's the best.

Second, they deliver. Sometimes it takes a while, but who cares? They're open until 2:00 am. Or do take-out. I never eat on location because there's only two tables outside and two chairs inside.

Third, I'd like to give a shout-out to Ryan. When he wasn't the one delivering my food or taking my order, I'd get disappointed. Ryan is on top of everything there and has never gotten my order wrong! Never!

This being said, a lot of the other guys HAVE gotten my order wrong. I think this could be because they are high (they certainly act like it). Call me snobby, but sometimes I hang up if it's not Ryan.

So...conclusion: go here, order from Ryan, get Greek Fries, take them home, enjoy your heavenly meal."}
{"text":"I usually love Oliveo. I've been eating from Oliveo Grill for years now. But I ordered my pizza over an hour ago and I am still waiting for it. It better not be cold...

Edit: They said they were on their way 15 minutes ago.

Edit: Got the pizza, it was cold. They won't give us our money back."}
{"text":"A-OK. It's pizza and they deliver. Tastes the same as just about every other pizza place out there. Only reason I got it was because they delivered to my residents. Would probably order from them again but do something other than basic pep pizza."}
{"text":"So i was starving and since im from California i decided to trust some yelp reviews... guess Arizona people have different taste buds... i ordered a canadian bacon and pineapple and some wings... it was very unsatisfying... I dont think i will be ordering from here again.  The crust was thin and floppy and the toppings were minimal... the wings were ok. at best but i have had way better almost everywhere.  I gave them 2 stars just cuz i felt like being nice... they are closer to 1.25..."}
{"text":"Soooooo this is literally the best pizza place we have come to find. And let me tell you why: first off their pizza is actually fresh and not used with shi*** ingredients. When you taste the pizza you can tell the mozzarella is super fresh and I think it's a delightful change. I will only order pizza from Oliveo because not only are they delicious but because they are very reasonably priced also. I can get a large pizza for under $10 and that's awesome especially for the high quality of pizza they make. Another plus about Oliveo is that they are open super late so you're able to eat something delicious when you've had a good night out.. When you go into Oliveo you can see for yourself they make everything there on the spot which is another thing we love. So yes, this is excellent pizza!!!! My whole household loves Oliveo, our neighbors, and our complex! So bam! Best fu***** pizza ever."}
{"text":"Second time in a row not receiving any service. First time about a week ago the phone rang and rang with no answer. Then tonight just now someone picked up the phone to only hang up on me. I like the food when I can actually order it but I will not waste any more time on this place."}
{"text":"Oliveo has been my mainstay for a couple years now Gus' always has a ridiculous wait time and oliveo always over shoots their time and shows up early which i love And their special pies are pretty good Malaka to all the competition"}
{"text":"Oliveo Pizza left a menu on my door a couple weeks back and I figured why not try somewhere new. I'm glad I did. I cannot comment on the restaurant itself since I haven't set foot inside, but I can say the pizza is great. All the ingredients tasted fresh. The price isn't anymore than you'd pay at any decent pizza place, and the taste is well worth its value. The Greek salad we ordered with the pizza was also quite good. 

The late night delivery is also a big bonus to this place. Oliveo also has late night specials. Where was this place when I was going to ASU? Oliveo does charge a few dollars for delivery, but the delivery range is massive compared to most places in the area (they go way farther than the typical 2 to 3 mile zone). The menu is loaded with several specialty pizzas that all sound interesting. I will definitely order up from Oliveo again and give one of those a try!"}
{"text":"The pizza tasted amazing! Of course the next day I'm pretty sure I had food poisoning. It could have just been a coincidence and I got a quick flash of the flu. Either way, getting sick was almost worth it, if that was the cause."}
{"text":"Always bringing it. I order here usually and there's a few reasons. Friendly staff, good pizza, on time, right price. Simple. Long past due for this hats off review to oliveo pizza. Sincerely,
The fluffy crust guy."}
{"text":"The pizza here isn't great, but compared to other \"cheap\" pizza places it's pretty tasty. I mean  the crust, cheese, sauce, and toppings actually taste like those things, which might sound like a no-brainer, but with real cheap pizza you never know what it's gonna taste like. 

I've always gotten the two 14'' pizza deal w/two toppings (on each pizza) for $16 (it actually used to be $14.99) with my family. That's a pretty good deal IMO (and like I said, the pizza is actually pretty good). I will say, I thought it was odd the last time I ordered from here I was quoted a price that seemed high to me over the phone. I mentioned it when I went in to pick up & was told you had to mention over the phone when ordering the \"deal.\" I mean, they gave it to me, but still thought it was odd I had to mention it. 

All in all, this place has pretty solid cheap pizza. I also believe they serve by the slice even tough it's not on display (maybe at certain times it is), and I noticed when you check on on foursquare you can get a free slice w/purchase. Cool beans.  

Oliveo does have some seating, but not much so carryout or delivery are your best options."}
{"text":"This is my go to pizza delivery place. Pizza is always so cheesy and good, fast service and delivery!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and the crust is bomb! The mozzarella sticks suck but the marinara was amazing. The wings are really good too."}
{"text":"Well, here I am trying to write a review for a pizza THAT STILL ISN'T HERE. Ordered it 90 minutes ago. Calls to the place for the last 45 minutes have received a \"it's on its way\" remark. I'd LOVE a phone call from the owner giving me a reason to give their business a second chance.

You know where I live, because you left your door hangers on my property as if to say, \"Here! *you* throw this away instead!\"


EDIT- THE PIZZA IS HERE! and it's cold."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this place two stars is because the food is perfect late night pizza and such. I suggest just getting it delivered. The staff inside does not care about their customers. I heard lots of profanity, even the guy making the pizzas was spitting into the trash can. The inside is not kept up at all. The deliver driver as he was leaving said as he was reading the ticket for where he was going said and I quote \"tipping in cash, my a$&.\" Just stick with delivery.. Don't expect anything special from the service."}
{"text":"It's late, I've had a very pleasant evening, and I find myself with pre-bedtime munchies. I'd cleaned my kitchen earlier and am loathe to fill my sink with more dishes, so after commiserating with a buddy about an acute lack of late night Thai in my neighborhood I search Yelp for places still open when Oliveo's Pizza pops up. Generally favourable reviews, so who am I to deny myself a potentially tasty late-night pie?

I'm happy to see that I can order online, so I pull up their clunky but overall serviceable interface and toss in an order for a pizza and some root beer within a few minutes. Also, no ridiculous fees for pithy shit like ordering online or using a credit card  like the ones Gus's tacks on to their bill. A big plus. One oddity, the quoted delivery time is nearly two hours away, but when I get my confirmation email it seems that their whole system is an hour ahead so I don't have to hold back the munchie demons until damn near 3am. Quirky, but nothing wrong.

So here I sit, waiting for my pizza, I'll write the rest of the review after it shows up and gets in mah belleh.

Well then. Color me pleased, the pizza showed up earlier than expected and is incredibly tasty. I especially love the crust, not enough places do it right. So now I have a late night pizza joint, I'm calling this a big win all around."}
{"text":"Grrrrrrreat delivery service. Classy, youthful, blonde haired-blue eyed man delivers in a timely fashion. Order the chicken bruschetta pizza....BOMB.com"}
{"text":"You know I was super excited to try this pizza, the reviews all say how amazing it is! But.... We tried to use our Discount Dining Dollars, and their pizza restaurant is on there. We ordered the coupons (Which by the way costs money!) And when we tried to use it, they first said they would honor it, we placed our order and was out the door to go pick it up, they called back within 10 mins. And said the Owner is refusing to honor it. So were bummed we didn't get to try it! I will say the gentleman that was on the phone was VERY nice and he sincerely felt bad. Not his fault that the owner refused to help.. to bad could have had life long business!"}
{"text":"Not great but your best option in the area, And cheap.

This place has really grown on me after sampling the many crappy options in the area.

It has not blown me away. But the ingredients seem pretty good.

If there was a Venezia's Or Barros in Delivery Range - it would be a different story."}
{"text":"We ordered here for only the 2nd time last night and sorry to say it will be our last time.

My girlfriend ordered a pizza, salad and a brick of burnt wheat they tried to pass off as bread-sticks.

The pizza and salad were okay, not bad, but not great. The bread-sticks on the other hand were bad. We are not the ones to complain often but the experience after we discovered the burnt brick is what gets this review.

I call Oliveo after we realized that we were not going to be enjoying our bread-sticks to see if we can get another order, I was willing to pick it up if that were an option to save them from making another 0.8 mile drive to our place, but no.

The first guy put me on hold for 3mins and proceeded to put me on with a manager that barely spoke English and had the nerve to tell me they make the bread in the morning(its 6:30pm) and that that is how it comes out, there was nothing he could do....Never once said sorry or even attempted to make it right. 

I could tell he was uneasy on the phone and didn't know what to do, so I can only assume he was not a manager or just didn't care, before he could continue to stumble his words to give me more reasons why I paid for bullshi*, I just told him its all good and I'll just take my business elsewhere.

What really sucks is that we moved here from Chicago and are trying to support local businesses in our area but crappy service like this is why people here are stuck on chains, maybe we were better off ordering Papa John's."}
{"text":"I would rate it zero because the manager is a terrible person. They delivered to the wrong apt and when I called they started scalding me over it. Horrible management which means they most likely spit in your food."}
{"text":"Pizza, hot wings and greek fries are really good but when I tried there sandwiches 3 of my friends and I had to use the restroom 30 min later.I like to sit in and there 1 and only table and chairs are unbalanced hard and cold. the worst is when you go when the AA meetings are taking place next door and your eating and the people are freaking smoking. the 2nd hand smoke really makes you lose your appetite and make you sick. I would love to go when I want but seems like you have to drive by it to see if its okay to eat there. If it wasn't for the AA meetings and raggidy chairs and table it would be perfect but until then cant give it good props."}
{"text":"The pizza was great and so were the wings. We tried the greek fries not our thing but they were made well. Quick polite service."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is my go-to for pizza delivery. Pizza is very good and always hot when we get it. Wings are above average as well. The Greek fries are awesome and you get a ton of them, we usually never finish a small order. Pasta and sandwiches are great as well."}
{"text":"I had wings and pizza delivered from here a couple months ago. The only thing I can really recall is that the wings were gross. Really disappointing. The pizza was at best OK and really needed more sauce. I would not order from here again."}
{"text":"So I really enjoy the Oliveo Grill. So when I looked on their website and they weer pushing their new store Oliveo Pizza I decided I should try it out. I used a promotional coupon for 1 14in pizza with 2 toppings, garlic bread sticks and 8 wings for 13.99.

The guy on the phone was very nice, so I was happy, customer service is not something that a restaurant should ignore. Especially not when they're new. So I'm glad to say that the customer service is great.

So here is the rundown:

Pizza:
-sauce was marinara (I wanted white but they wouldn't do it for the coupon) and was pretty bland, it's on the sweet side
-crust is tasteless, not bad and not good, on the soft side
-the chicken was great and spicy
-the onion was too thin but not bad at all

Grade: C- , it wasn't bad it just wasn't, you know, good. 

Wings:
-crispy, just like I like them! (I requested extra crispy and I got my wish!)
-there was no extra sauce in the bottom of the container, and I generally want some to roll my wings in before eating
- the amount of sauce on the wings was fairly thin, which may be because they bake the wings to finish and it probably cooks off
-I ordered sweet and spicy and the sauce is really just sweet, the spice is super mild

Grade: B-, they have a lot of potential to be great, but they really need more sauce.

Bread sticks:
-flavorless, just a smattering of flavor on the top (they dust them in some kind of Italian spice mix) 
-thick, soft and crispy around the edges, pretty good
-marinara was barely above lukewarm when it got to my place

Grade: C+, because they are just bread sticks and the only way to make them really great is how much butter/Italian spice is on them, they were fairly disappointing. However, if they stepped up the spice they would be great because the bread really is cooked perfectly.  

Overall Grade: C+

Overall Thoughts: This place has a serious potential to be good because they already have great customer service and they KNOW how to cook things, it's just the 'finishing' of the food that really drops their grade. I also like that they deliver late.

I'd be willing to try again in a month or two to see if things have changed. :)"}
{"text":"Bad customer service.... To be determined.  


Hoping they will honor the credit (money I've already paid them) next time we call for whatever we choose on the menu.   

Didn't happen this time but fingers crossed that they want to keep a patron in the future"}
{"text":"Terrible. I probably shoulda known better than to order pasta from a greek place, but this is just false advertising and horrible cookery. The \"chicken alfredo pasta\" contained neither sauce, nor seasoning, spices, salt - nadda. It was a bunch of shredded chicken placed over soggy pasta, covered with a huge layer of plastic-y mozzarella cheese. I'm sorry, but if you're not gonna give me classic alfredo sauce (which i was CRAVING), and instead you're gonna try to put a Greek spin on an Italian classic, at LEAST make it flavorful! And call it something else!!!

You'd think they'd have gotten the Baklava right, at least - nope! Stale filo dough, a strange sour taste, and none of the sweetness or butteriness you'd expect. Absolute fail. Phoenician cafe is much better for baklava, and they don't make the mistake of trying to serve pasta. Lesson learned!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza tonight and it had obviously slid around cheese all to one side and wing sauce in the pasta... Just a mess, they offered to correct this with another delivery they pick up the food when dropping off the new order. So far everything routine until the driver tried to tell me the management is upset that they had to replace my order and apparently my roommate had a similar issue last week. I would love to know how this is my problem or why they felt a need to express their disappointment about have to replace their mess up. I delivered food for a several years and I couldn't imagine talking to a customer like that. I've been ordering for 2 1/2 years and never had a problem before this. Don't really see a need to continue ordering from them."}
