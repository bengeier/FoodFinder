{"text":"Amazing. So good we're not sure  where to start. Relaxed, classy.... Very good music. To top it all, the staff was witty, funny, welcoming and knowledgeable. Now, on to the main course: the food. We have, for the first time, in years, tasted real talent! We could go on for hours about how everything was so perfectly martched, the flavors so unique, the recipes so so original...and offered with the right wine, but it would be much more interesting for you to try it first hand.  Best culinary experience as long as we could remember!"}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Définitivement un must. Un menu des plus élaborés, une recherche des textures, des couleurs, des saveurs; c'est un vrai travail d'artiste. C'était une expérience parfaite, j'ai bien hâte d'y retourner afin de savoureux le nouveau menu."}
{"text":"Small gem of a restaurant Attentive service Great wine list Nothing but tasting menu  This is the kind of place everyone should try at least once in their lifetime. Reminds me of Luksus NYC but with wine instead of beer pairing. A must try."}
{"text":"This is one of the best meals, if not the best meal, I've ever had. Twelve of us were visiting Montreal from the States and we couldn't have asked for a better evening or experience. Everything from the food, to the wine pairings, to the cocktails, to the atmosphere, to the service was phenomenal.  One person in our party was allergic to shellfish and I am a pescetarian. They did such an amazing job of swapping out ingredients where we had restrictions to the point where we were excited dish after dish to see what variation they were going to come up with for us, and we never felt like a burden.   I would HIGHLY recommend this place for anyone from a date night to a large party. I'm even contemplating coming back to Montreal just to share the experience with my fiancé."}
{"text":"A mind-blowing gastronomic experience. I love restaurants with fixed menus because I generally want to try multiple dishes. We took the 11-course tasting menu with wine accompaniment. It was absolutely brilliant. Highlights include the sea urchin pie and the foie gras, maple and chamomile dessert. The atmosphere was relaxed and all is served on  hand-made plates and bowls. The taste of each bite was elevated by the different textures. All in all, it was an edible artistic experience."}
{"text":"Wow! A legend in action! Chef Antonin Mousseau is the sun of amazing Quebec poet Michel Rivard, Grandson of  Jean-Paul Mousseau, who painted many Montreal Métro masterpieces. Color and originality show up on the plate. Small restaurant, attentive service, original wine list, and Awesome chef! The Montreal en lumières menu is outstanding! If you can get a reservation, you ought to try it. The menu is a list of seven colors.  And every dish is spectacular. Fresh, well prepared, and so tasty! The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and so much fun. Could you believe four gras wrapped in candy floss ? Well it was delicious.  Glad to see Antonin has now is own little spot!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals in my entire life, and MADE my trip to Montreal.  I was alone in the city and had caught a cold.  I phoned at noon to ask for a reservation, and they agreed to squeeze me in at 6 PM opening time as long as I left before 8 PM.  I declined alcohol due to my health, and they brought me hot water with lemon.  I was totally catered to - all dishes explained, no rush - just as if I was the most important customer they ever had. Although the prix fixe sounds expensive in Canadian $, it worked out to be reasonable in $US.  The presentation was gorgeous, the tastes delicious, variety charming.  I will certainly return if/when I go again to Montreal."}
{"text":"It's fucking ludicrous how good this restaurant is. I just got home from having the same menu the second time and it was even better this time. Go here, easily the best place in Montreal right now. Insanely inventive, crazy well paced and tasty as hell. This is punk rock food at its finest."}
{"text":"C'est pas pour rien que tous les récentes critiques le nomme comme meilleur Resto de Montréal. Joe Beef ET compagnie peuvent aller se recoucher à côté du Mousso. On ne peut honnêtement comparé aucun autre restaurant à Montréal à celui-ci. Nous n'avons pas les étoiles Michelin à Montréal mais pour en avoir essayé, ce Resto en vaudrait quelques unes. La nourriture est tout simplement extraordinaire. Le mariage de saveurs, le mélange de textures, on se laisse surprendre à chaque plat, on ne veut pas que ça se termine. JAMAIS. Il est certain qu'aussi bien manger s'accompagne d'un coût, mais il est rare qu'on peut affirmer avec certitude que chaque dollar dépensé le vaut! Allez-y all in avec le pairing de vin, c'est encore mieux. Avec un peu d'eau aussi! Le service est lui aussi impeccable. Certains diront que La musique dérange, moi jai bien aimé avoir une expérience gastronomique sans un service et une musique trop pincée. Bref, on préféra se priver de quelques sorties restos pour se permettre d'y retourner rapidement. Franchement, bravo!"}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to try out this new place and am thrilled that we got to try the 7 service fixed menu during le Mousso's soft opening. We were a party of 4 who reserved for 9h30 on a Thursday night. I called last minute to say we would could only make it for 10pm, thinking they would turn us down but instead they said no problem and that they would accommodate us without a problem. We really appreciated this.  The place was packed upon arrival. Walking into the restaurant felt like walking into a friend's kitchen. The staff greeted us warmly and our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable. I didn't really have any expectations although I heard good things about the chef's past work and was really hoping for a good experience.   The tasting menu was a fixed 7 service meal. Every single plate was a work of art and meticulously put together. I really appreciated how much thought was put into the pairing of ingredients, tastes and textures. Everything was good, and 4 of the plates really impressed me. The mussels and tartar were to die for, and so was the dessert. It was a little pricey with taxes and tip but worth it for the experience. I really enjoyed the fact that you can finally enjoy fine dining in a completely unpretentious setting (the playlist was a good mix of mostly hip hop tracks). Would recommend it and am looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"This place has one of the best tasting menus in Montreal at the moment. The dishes are insanely inventive and delicious, and the setting and service are great too. Wonderful! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I ended up at Le Petit Mousso by complete fluke since Le Mousso was complete for reservations. (Be warned the original Le Mousso has a horrible reservation system - by voicemail only- they call you back and let you know if you have a spot.) So when the manager called back to let me know there was no space - he recommend the sister site - le Petit Mousso that has been open for a little over 2 weeks. So, I decided to try out the sister site instead.  Le petit Mousso is located in the same building as Le Mousso but to the left side. Industrial look, with weird throwback 90s r&b hits playing in the background. Really odd and doesn't really jive with the restaurant ambiance.  We were seated quickly and given a menu listing tapas styled dishes similiar to Vin Mon Lapin. We pretty much tried everything on the menu- there was a large presence of seafood. All dishes were good to share for up to 4 people. My favourite was the asapargus and shrimp dishes.   The cocktails had weird unappetizing names- but they proved me wrong. One of the cocktails had shitake syrup that was actually a quite nice with gin. The wine selection was a good one.  A few other issues came up that I noticed. People from Le Mousso were dining in the sister site. It made no sense really you are at a complete different restaurant and I was told reservations were full at Le Mousso - kind of misleading, no? 2) when I tried pouring the wine for myself, some guy popped up and told me not to - and he would take care of it. I get he was trying to be professional but I don't need to be served everytime I fill my glass of wine.   This site has a lot of potential - as the food quality was great comparable to the big guys like Joe Beef level, but they need to tweak little things like management and reservations, etc... to really give the full experience.  On a happy note, I was able to make reservations for Le Mousso!"}
{"text":"Incredible! Extremely creative and very well executed dishes!  Sea urchin pie was quite memorable...visually and by taste!  Roasting potatoes by flaming hay tableside while explaining the dish, what?!  Service was top notch!  Wine pairing was well done!   Communal style seating, but don't be shy...everyone is there for good food and good company! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Difficile de faire plus innovant, le Mousso offre un bol d'air à la gastronomie montréalaise. Du talent à l'état brut, le jeune chef Antonin nous a surpris avec sa cuisine nouveau monde et des combinaisons de saveurs très recherchées. Le jeune staff dynamique est agreable et pas prétentieux faites leur confiance. Réservez avant c'est toujours plein."}
{"text":"Where do I start?   For one, I am in love with the casual atmosphere of this gastronomic restaurant. The chef walks around with his beanie and talks to customers without pretension, the waiters are down-to-earth, and if you go to the bathroom and pass by the kitchen, it's awesome to see how much the staff is having fun.   The surprise menu is an adventure, and some dishes are very audacious (I mean, a dessert with beetroots, chocolate and goat cheese? Who does that?). The menu is cryptic: it only lists the main ingredients but says nothing about how they're cooked or how they'll be used together. Surprisingly, for a gastronomic restaurant, the 11-course meal left us quite full. For the experience we got, the price was very reasonable.   I won't spoil the surprise by describing the plates in too much details, but I was pleased to see that there was a strong theme around which the meal revolved. Elements of the forest and nature (pine branches, stones, minerals, grass, wood, shrubbery) were a leitmotiv, masterfully incorporated into a feast for the five senses. The plates often combined many surprising ingredients together. I mentioned the beetroot/chocolate/goat cheese combo, but there was the equally audacious mushroom + maple taffy, and foie gras + cotton candy. Other plates were more tame (such as the harissa and lamb, with a carrot macerated in butter), but quite eclectic in influence. There was a loaf of homemade bread, with its homemade butter, and right before, there had been a duo of perfectly seared scallops in their pearly shells; the rustic standing alongside the fancy. I especially loved the special emphasis on locally-sourced products.   The only downside was the seating; we were sitting at a 6-people table with 2 other couples, and we kept getting spoilers from seeing the plates served to the people on our left. The only thing we could do was to completely avoid looking to our left.  We'll definitely come again when the menu changes."}
{"text":"As others have said, this is an expensive place. Probably, one of those places where you go once in your life for something important to celebrate, deciding to pay the money for the experience. You will not come out at less than 100-150$ per person. Having said that, the menu, the quality of the products served, the flavours, the service and the atmosphere are all part of this experience and the experience is (for once) worth the price. It serves a seasonal menu with a set number of services... We had 9! Starting with cotton candy foie gras all the way to the fir tree marshmallows. There are fish plates and meat plates and entrees and dessert... Your stomach will not believe its eyes! Your tastebuds will thank you later! So why only 4 stars? Because some of the plates were not well balanced... The trout and hollandaise was more of a big bulge of hollandaise with a small piece of (delicious) trout (really, there's just so much hollandaise one can eat). Same thing for the celeriac mousse and oysters. And really, because the menu could do without a couple of services. When you have to force yourself to eat the last couple of plates because you're simply not hungry anymore, you're just not enjoying the food as much as it should be, which is a real shame given the goodness that is in front of you."}
{"text":"Maybe 4 1/2 stars?  Some really good things and one miss.  So from that, hard to give 5 stars in my book.  But creative and interesting things, so of course one or two might not work for everyone.  I think it is always good to be challenged a bit and that is what this sort of place does.  Visually everything was a treat for the eyes.  Most dishes were nicely balanced and had good flavors.    Excellent service, great wine pairings.  We can't stop raving about the halibut dish we had, the butter milk vinaigrette totally elevated the dish.  The pepper meringue was inspired and made the first dessert extra special with the buttermilk ice cream, that was something to dream about!  The uni pie was interesting and a good play on who your eyes see something different than you taste.  Really, the only disappointment was the duck.  Nothing really going on there.  But since the menu is always changing, I would go back and try the next set of creations.  Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Not sure why everyone loves it. We were 4 people and we all didn't like the food.  Each plate was interesting to look at but the taste wasn't to our liking.  Service was good and menu interesting. We had fun but we wouldn't go back due to the taste."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing and exceeded our expectations. Came here on a Friday night with my boyfriend and we were absolutely blown away.   There is only one choice and it is the tasting menu. Small dishes of the chefs choosing. The plates were so beautiful, we eat with our eyes first! And the taste matched the beauty. We started with beverages I got the Chinatown which tasted amazing and had absinthe in it, my boyfriend had a beer, there was only one choice, red stripe, but that was fine!   When our amuse bouche came it was insane. 3 dishes with the theme of charcoal. My personal favourite was the cotton candy with foie gras inside, but all of them were mind-blowing.   On one of the dishes we found a fly, we told the waiter, just expecting an apology. But he went above and beyond to correct what was out of his control. The service made the amazing meal even better.   The chicken and mushroom dish was to die for. Usually I don't like to eat chicken at restaurants because it can be dry, but it melted in my mouth.   The lamb dish was also amazing, so tender and the sauces were divine. We literally wiped each dish clean it was all so amazing.   Dessert was also very interesting. I prefer my desserts not to be overly sweet and they delivered. Really unique flavors I would never have thought to combine.   All in all, I definitely recommend this place, especially for a special occasion.  Food and service was exceptional."}
{"text":"Je dois l'admettre, je ne suis pas du genre à dépenser une fortune pour un repas, et les rares fois où j'ai dépensé plus de 100$ pour ma gamelle, je n'ai pas été très impressionné...  Mais là...  Là, on n'est plus dans la nourriture... Ce qu'on consomme, avec tous nos sens en éveil, ce sont de véritables oeuvres d'art.  Des frissons m'ont parcouru l'épine dorsale presque à chaque bouchée, tous les plats, toutes les saveurs étaient d'une longueur inouïe en bouche, d'une complexité parfaitement équilibrée entre l'éclat et la finesse.  On ne peut qu'admirer l'audace et la science qui ont permis d'imaginer de tels plats!  Je n'en dis pas plus.  C'est un voyage, c'est un cadeau à s'offrir, c'est cher, mais ça en vaut le coup!  Un seul menu pour tous le monde 7 services. Nous sommes demeurés à table pendant près de 4h30. À peu près 150$ par personne, plus taxes et service, incluant un vin différent par service, sans les extras."}
{"text":"We had the worst experience of our holidays at the Mousso - it was so bad that it has been a running joke since then (and yes, I am aware that I seem to be the only Yelper to think so...)  First of all, there were really, really a lot of sea products - in the same day, we ate oysters, urchins, clam, fish eggs (and that's not including the actual fishes). Since it is a set surprise menu, it is a bit of a risk if you are not that much of a sea person.   Second, most of the dishes ranged from bland (a potato just cooked in hay, with no seasoning whatsoever) to bad (a wayyyy oversalted white fish) to disgusting (stag heart, dried up then grated over a plate). There is a line between inventive cuisine and dishes gone wrong, and the Mousso was on the bad side the night we visited. Desserts were good though - less creative, but way better tasting.   Service was friendly, but a little unorganized - we had to wait 20 mn to get our (reserved) table - during which they kindly offered us a drink on the house -, then the time between each plate seemed quite random. Oh, also, the restaurant was way too cold and the music way too loud - but at this point, it was just one more fail to laugh about.   If you are looking for a nice restaurant for a special occasion (as we were), try Bouillon Bilk - we loved it! And it costs the same price: ~80 Canadian dollars for the degustation menu, excl. tips and taxes."}
{"text":"I ve been wanting to come here for a while. I know that their reputation is phenomenal and really glad I finally made reso for dinner. The space is modern. The staff is very friendly, enthusiastic and helpful. They seem to be having great fun working which is an amazing thing to see. I could feel their positive vibe (and they should because this is 2 days after their Laurier win) The concept is simple: everyone eats the same thing! I have signaled them in advance about a need for glutenfree friendly and they absolutely took care of my request. Everything that had gluten, they replaced it with something else just as delicious. We took cocktails to start: The mushroom miso & the parsley basil, both made with gin. WOW! I especially loved the charred mushroom slices atop the drink. The food was frigging amazing! Great flavor balance in every bite. Almost everything was fish & seafood except for the chicken and beef. Very well executed in terms of herbs & spices. Some surprising matching as well like the cucumber & white chocolate ganache dessert: whaaaattttt!!!!! Wow wow wow! We also took the wine pairing service and everything was on point (i would suggest taking the half size if you are here mid-week lol!!!) I would definitely come back and highly recommend this restaurant. Treat yo self!"}
{"text":"This resto was amazing! My friend generously took me here for my bday. They only have a tasting menu. I read online that they had the tasting menu for $60 on Wednesdays but they didn't have that special when we went. I guess they got rid of it. We sat at the bar and the bartender was nice and described every dish for us.  The tasting menu consisted of eleven plates. Every dish was unique, flavorful and well presented. There wasn't one dish I didn't like. We started with one cocktail each. Mine was a cocktail of gin and aperol. It was was very good and very pretty. We also did the wine pairing. Each wine was so good and beautifully paired with each dish. I wish they had them at the SAQ!  The first dish was one oyster each with peas and verbena. It was presented on a bed of rocks. The second dish was a kale chip with cheese on top. The cheese made it very good. It tasted like goat cheese but there was also shredded cheese on top. Thirdly, we had one small potato each which was set on fire atop a bed of hay. It looked like a bird's nest with eggs inside caught on fire. The potatoes came with a bowl of sour cream. The fourth dish was a slice of sea urchin pie with edible flowers on top.  Next we had what resembled a taco filled with shrimp, herbs, tomatoes and radishes. Later we had tuna with radishes and tomatoes in a light broth which came with a sake pairing. The seventh dish was an extra $18 and consisted of lobster, matsutake mushrooms, chicken skin and shaved truffle. The shaved truffle was extra. Next we had the halibut with onion and chanterelles (fungus) on top. The ninth dish was deer with beets, fruits and fermented garlic which was paired with a nice red wine. Next we had two desserts. One was like an ice cream on a stick with flowers. It had chamomille, maple and foie gras, The other was a silver edible sheet with fruit.   I felt very satisfied with the meal. The menu changes every so often. I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Menu fixe gastronomique 7 services ! Créatif, goûteux & artistique !  Bravo au chef & son équipe ! Vraiment réussi de A à Z. Beau local, déco simple, cuisine inventive, très beau visuellement, petits plats succulents (ex:poireaux / moules beurre / noisette) de la haute gastronomie revisitée. Très bon service & courtoisie de notre barmen/serveur au bar. Formule unique de 7 services (mercredi 50$) & (jeudi au samedi 60$), rajouté 45$ pour les accords de vins. De plus, on peut choisir des extras (amuse bouche +10$), pain (+5$) ou encore durant le service prendre l'option supplémentaire (pétoncle/foie/prune +12$). Niveau prix, pour deux personnes donc, au final avec extras, +apéro/digestif/alcool, +café, +services/taxes = 387$. On s'entend que, oui, c'est dispendieux, mais si l'on vient ici, c'est pour des occasions spéciales pour célébrer ou pour les purs foodies qui veulent très bien manger et déguster quelque chose d'artistique et nouveau. Honnêtement, ça valait vraiment la peine et mon invité dans ce cas ci, mon frère fut comblé par son expérience culinaire pour son anniversaire. Que demander de mieux alors. Donc, conclusion, si vous pensez venir ici pour manger des burgers ou des pâtes/pizzas comme dans plusieurs restaurants, vous vous êtes vraiment trompés, ce n'est pas l'endroit pour. J'aime l'idée de cette formule unique gastronomique de restaurant et je pense que c'est une première à Montréal ! Encore une fois, bravo !   *ps: Pensez à réserver, ça se remplit vite.  5/5 visité en novembre 2015"}
{"text":"I would have taken pictures of the food here, but I don't think they would have done justice to how brilliantly amazing it was. Also, as soon as I took the first bite, taking pictures was the last thing on my mind. Every bite feels like it has been specially crafted just for you."}
{"text":"What a great resource for Montreal. If you seek 3 hour+, high-quality adventures in gastronomy, book it. And don't even consider not taking the optional pairing, it was perfect (wine from all over the world, sake and even a mead made with buttermilk). The cocktails were also exceptional. I've added images of menu and each course.  Loved:  Unique, and at times challenging, 11 courses (+1 optional) tasting menu. Informal atmosphere Truly excellent service, friendly and well choreographed Good value  Questioned: Loud music in the dining room. I'm in two minds about this as it seems like a feature for the chefs, which is an interesting idea, but it made it hard to hear the conversation sometimes."}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I've ever had!! It was a 9 course tasting menu with or without wine pairing. Every dish was original, delicious and just perfect. The service was excellent and the dishes arrived and were cleared at a good pace. We will definitely be going back! The restaurant is also able to accommodate allergies if they are mentioned when you make a reservation."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. In my opinion, the price is very reasonable given the food and the overall experience. My group and I ordered the 10 course menu (only baseline option) and some of us also ordered an extra optional course.  In terms of actual dishes, among the 11 I received, I found 3 to be outstanding, 2 to be excellent, 3 to be solid, and 1 to be a disappointment. The other 2 courses were tiny bites that were enjoyable but I don't find them to \"move the needle\" in terms of my overall experience.  The outstanding dishes were a sea urchin tarte and the two desserts. The tarte was incredible and its sea urchin filling was eye-opening - it embodies several tastes that I associate w/ foie gras but also preserves a uniqueness because, among other things, it is lighter and more colorful. The two dessert dishes were: (1) a buttermilk ice cream with a duo of strawberry coulis and thin pepper meringue (just wonderful) and (2) a camomille (and milk?) popsicle with crumbled bits of maple sugar and frozen foie gras sprinkled on top (a nice refreshing way to finish the meal - the use of maple and foie in the dish exhibited restraint and, consequently, these elements managed to play a deliciously supporting rather than overpowering role in the dish).  The excellent and solid dishes had great elements but also incorporated slightly odd components which didn't jive with my pallette. We all have different pallettes so this assessment almost surely would vary from person to person. Regardless, this experience is par for the course at ambitious restaurants that constantly change their menu (even the very best ones). The disappointing dish was a halibut topped with smoked chanterelles that was accompanied with a heirloom onion, brocoli puree (and sauce?), and the leaves of some sort of flower. The most disappointing element of the dish was the fish. I presume it was salt cured and, possibly, rehydrated (though I may be wrong). The end result: it was excessively salty (remark: I usually love salt) and the texture approached that of a paste. Everyone at the table agreed that this was their least preferred dish. Don't take this the wrong way though, one disappointment over the entire N-course meal is perfectly acceptable to me.  Beyond the taste experience, I'd like to add that all the dishes were aesthetically beautiful and the service was extremely pleasant and accommodating. I will definitely revisit Le Mousso in the near future."}
{"text":"I went to this place with my hopes up high.... Now i can not say i was disappointed...of course not!!! But i was hoping it was the best place i have ever been.... and its not. The service was great, the Sommelier did a great job on pairing the wine.!!! We took the 11th dish with the extra truffle ....  But i what really did surprise me ... was the dessert..!!!! This is a must to all foodies out there ...and it totally deserves more than 4 stars ... just not 5 to my liking"}
{"text":"Can I put 10+ stars? I took my husband here for his 35th birthday dinner and I never saw him like this. We were greeted with so much warmth and felt comfortable right away. Started with delicious cocktails then the waiter came to start our journey on this exceptional foodie experience! I will try and describe each dish as accurately as possible. It was a menu in collaboration with the Festival Montreal en Lumière. So i took the seven service with wine pairing menu and Felix took the eight service with wine pairing menu and the extra truffles in one of the dishes. Every dish was as mesmerizing as the other. Not one single bad criticism about any. I am, by profession, a pastry chef and usually would have something to criticize about. Nope. Not this time! We were taking on an unforgettable journey! I am a sucker for good service. Ok. This, what we had was exceptional service! I will most definitely come back as soon as I can. The bill totalled up to about 450$ and it was all worth it. A special occasion for a special person in my life at a special restaurant! Look out for Jocelyn. He was our waiter. Attentive, professional, nice and all around very pleasant to talk to! Cute too if I might add!"}
{"text":"Very very good. In Europe this would get a a Michelin Star. Great value for your money for beautiful and tasty plates with excellent service and wine."}
