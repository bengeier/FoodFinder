{"text":"I've been here on several occasion (1) with friends in a group of 6 (2) with my partner. 

Pros
- Spicy Salmon Roll is delicious but expensive for 8.95 (6 pieces)
- Diversity of rolls (they have pages and pages with pictures of rolls)
- If you like hearty rolls, this is a place to go as they tend to have gigantic rolls and it seems to be what is driving their business. However, it doesn't mean the quality of their sashimi/sushi is the best!

Cons
- Service is terrible (everyone knows this, but if you aren't looking for fine dining in Mississauga, you'll be okay to put up with their service).
- Their sashimi is not the freshest and not the highest grade. Remember, there are different types of sashimi grade and this is definitely not it. Places like Sushi Tei have better quality fish, but on the other hand lack the diversity of rolls that Hinote has. 
- Oh, did I mention service is terrible? 

Example to Exemplify Bad Service 
My friends and I ordered at least 150 dollars worth of rolls (hey we like to eat), and we ordered two spicy tuna rolls, thinking it would be as amazing as their spicy salmon roll. WRONG. We all had a bite, and thought the fish tasted really fishy (for those out there saying well DUH - sashimi is suppose to taste fishy! Incorrect. When fish is fresh, it won't taste or smell \"fishy\" (ask GORDON RAMSEY). However, this tasted really off and we wanted to sent the other spicy tuna roll back. 

The server consulted with their sushi chefs, and came back telling us we were wrong on the following grounds:

(1) there is a difference between not liking something and something tasting bad, not fresh 

(2) we probably haven't been here before but this is how they make it. 

We asked him did he try it? He proceeded to say no he did not but there is no way that this roll is not fresh. Can we say customer service is crap? Whatever, after insulting us that we don't what good sushi tastes like (hello - have you heard of Ja BIstro? Antonio Park?), we decided we weren't going to ruin a good night out, so said okay we'll take it back with no intentions of eating it. However, they realized they might have made a mistake and came back to take it away saying they wouldn't charge us for it, but charged for the first roll. Perfect - maybe they should have done all of that before insulting us.

This experience has left a sour taste in my mouth. I'm all about supporting family businesses, which Hinote clearly is, but I cannot accept ignorance when a customer is telling you something is not fresh (we didn't send back the other 15 rolls we ordered!). We all decided we would never go back to Hinote, b/c there are just way better quality sushi/sashimi out there, even in the burbs, that their customer service is just not worth enduring."}
{"text":"A great place for sushi. Service is hit and miss but if you're in on a good day you can be in and out in 30 minutes.  The food had always been fantastic here (a bit pricey), we've been coming here for over a decade.  The salad dressing is awesome! Free fried banana and if the service is slow they usually give some freebies during the wait."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on Christmas eve.  Sushi was great and came fast.  I'm no expert, but it tasted very fresh.  Banana dumplings for dessert were awesome.  So glad to find a restaurant in Mississauga that is actually any good."}
{"text":"I organized a dinner here for a party of 10 on a Saturday night. The service was terrible. I had asked for water for the table several times and it wasn't served. The waitress was in such a rush to get everyone's order and brought us the bill without giving us a chance to order desert. She didn't check in between to see how we were doing and one of us had to get up and approach the counter to request a glass of water. The waitress asked twice how many of us wanted water when I repeatedly asked for the entire table and only some of us got it in the end. They also added on a 15% gratuity without mentioning it during the booking. The seating area was so tight that it was hard to get up - we had some electrical wires below our feet and my friend hit her head hard on some overhead obstacle behind her seat! A few of us ordered chicken and beef teriyaki, which was really bland, and one of the pieces of sushi that was ordered by others had the top part slightly cooked when it was smoked. Not a good experience for groups!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Hinote Sushi for about 6 years.
During every visit the service was excellent, quality of food was excellent.

One must understand that this is a VERY SMALL privately owned place, everything is prepared fresh, therefore the speed of service during peek hours will be longer than your average premade sushi place.

The price point is perfect for what it is.

Overall, I would highly recommend this place if you are a sushi connoisseur. Otherwise stick to an AYCE please."}
{"text":"Worst experience at this restaurant today. We called at 5 p.m. and ordered a sushi tray for 7 p.m., a two hour period which you would think would allow sufficient time to prepare a relatively small tray. Apparently not. It would have been fine if the tray was maybe 15 mins, maybe even half an hour late; we all know that it's a busy night. However, after an hourlong wait, we asked again about our order and was told that it hadn't even been started, which is just plain ridiculous. Throughout that hour, we had asked several times about the order too and received a quick brushoff every time. We simply sat there for an hour with no idea when, or if, our dinner would ever come. Finally, we couldn't put up with this unprofessional service any longer and left empty handed. We didn't receive any acknowledgement or compensation for this complete waste of time. 

We've been fairly regular customers, but I don't think we will ever return. Simply put, terrible uncourteous service that verges on the point of irresponsible. Making your customers wait an hour is simply unacceptable. I hope they realize the immense frustration and disrespect that we experienced. This is no way to run a business. One star."}
{"text":"Not much to complain about here. Ate lunch surrounded by regulars, including one gentleman who didn't even have to order.

Sashimi cuts were generous, fresh, and flavorful. Service was attentive yet unobtrusive.

Surroundings were pretty boring, but what do you expect for Mississauga"}
{"text":"I was initially going to give this place 3.5/5, but I bumped it up half a point just because of that fabulous complimentary cinnamon tea the wonderful lady gave at the end. 

Overall, the sushi is of very good quality. It's one of the better places in Mississauga. The rolls are quite big, so don't let the numbers fool you. The fish is fresh and the rolls are well formed. 

Service wise, I would say they're quite good. One caveat: $2 for a SMALL amount of spicy mayo?! Unfortunately, I'm a big fan of spicy mayo, so this slightly bothered me. 

Would I come back? I'm still on the fence about that. Probably, yes. 

Give this place a shot if you're in the area. Let me know what you think! Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"Sushi is amazing ... dynamite roll, salmon roll, seafood udon are all musts when i go. the sushi pizza is good but ask them to make it crispy... they sometimes bring it out very soft. 

the service is terrible, but honestly, i keep coming back for the quality.  definitely the best sushi place in toronto/gta."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday night.  Service was absolutely terrible!  The waitress rushed us throughout the entire meal and literally pushed us out of the door in just over 20 minutes.  Probably the shortest dinner I have ever had in my whole life!  Food was not bad.  But a little pricy for what it is.   I'm not sure if this place deserves the reputation of \"the best sushi in Mississauga.\"  Nothing special.  Just for the bad service, I will never go back there again!"}
{"text":"So glad we found this place. This is now one our our favourite sushi restaurants in Mississauga. Came here both for lunch and dinner. Lunch menu is very good. Their lunch combo runs on average around $16. It will leave you very full.

From the outside the restaurant looks hidden and uninviting but the food totally makes up for it.  

Sashimi is very fresh and \"sweet\". Love it! The complimentary cinnamon tea served after is nice and lovely. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The sushi was alright, however, I asked for some spicy sauce to be drizzled over the sushi (6 piece) I ordered and they charged $2 extra for it. It costs $2 to make an entire bottle of sauce, I thought that was very unnecessary. They didn't even offer to remove that charge when they saw our reactions. Also, we had ordered a mini tray (18 piece) and I asked that they replace the 6 cucumber rolls with inari (tofu). She charged an extra $1 and only brought out 2 pieces!! Thats absolutely ridiculous customer service. I definitely will not go back there again."}
{"text":"Hinote is by far the best sushi in Mississauga, always fresh and great service.  I have been going here for a few years but have tried other places only to realize there is nowhere like Hinote."}
{"text":"Been going to this sushi joint which is closer to my home and food is amazing! Service is good depending on how busy they get!"}
{"text":"Great food with mediocre service. 

Possibly one of the best sushi restaurants in central Mississauga however the service is something to be desired. 

When we saw a booth opening up we'd asked our server if we can have it. We received a plain no as a response with no further explanation. Also when we asked for more tea, the server proceeded to fill everyone else in the restaurant and left our table for last with the remaining last drop in the pot. 

Some of my friends who visited Hinote also agreed that the service is less than desirable. But aside from the service, the food is great. Good quality and portions. 

Just be weary of their service."}
{"text":"Sushi was good, although a bit pricier overall than our preferred Sushi Tei close to Square One. If you go during the busy times, expect to wait for your sushi/sashimi dinner as there are only 2 chefs fulfilling those orders and their station is compact. Cooked food seemed to come out sooner as there was another chef in the back taking care of that. I enjoyed this experience as my wife and I had some catching up to do about the week, however we got there at 7:20 pm, and our entree arrived at 8:10 pm. Food was great, just unfortunate about the wait time."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came to eat here and I was extremely Disappointed with the food and service I received.

First of all my food came out 15 minutes after my girlfriends entree, the excuse was that the sushi counter was busy yet my girlfriend had ordered a roll along with her entree and they both cane out together, my sashimi dish was nowhere to be found.

When it finally came out there was no apology, its fine at this point I am just hungry. One of the first things I bit into was a piece of Tako sashimi, now I am no stranger to this however the taste was so bad I had to spit it out immediately, it tasted old and sour like a foot. Sadly I was so hungry I decided to keep going, the rest of the dish was surprisingly good.

Mid meal I decided to ask for some water since my dish was extremely spicy, I made eye contact and signaled several staff but yet they could not seem to be bothered. The place was not even that busy, there were 5-6 tables at most including us.

Needless to say I will not be returning which is sad given the fact that the food was not all that bad."}
{"text":"Wow service has gotten extremely worse! 20 minute wait just for our order to be be taken. Never again. The price is already steep as it is. You cannot expect a customer to put up with abysmal service while paying 30-40$ for dinner."}
{"text":"I try not to leave negative reviews unless abysmally horrid and this experience, imo, warranted it. 

My fiance and I were starving and driving in the area and decided, upon the great ratings provided by yelp, to try this restaurant. I ordered the eel donburi and my fiance ordered the pork katsu. We ordered a philly roll to get us started.

The roll was mediocre. It wasn't bad,  it wasn't good. The rice was a little off. The biggest let down was the eel donburi which came in a little bento type box that was as about big as my hand. The portion was so miniscule I was even hungrier than before I'd started! The rice was layered underneath like a thin slab. They could have at least given me more rice! The eel was awful. It was tiny little strips of eel and for $14 for that miniature meal, I'd expect the best damn eel there was but no! It was super fatty and was not skinned properly and therefore had a really fishy and almost 'dirty' taste to it. I was so hungry,  I didn't want to bother sending it back. My fiance got better portioning and said it tasted okay but since he got his meal a good 10-15 minutes after I did, I ended up watching him eat after I finished my meal. Im sure my surmounting hunger did not do anything to abate my irritation as I watched him eat but that donburi was fricking expensive for such a terrible meal and even though I tipped for a decent service,  my hunger induced anger and the price has marked this was one of my worst experiences at a restaurant."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch, & it's obvious that it is popular with the lunch crowd, which ranges from office goers to families. Service is efficient but don't expect friendly faces or a relaxed ambience. I'm no expert on sushi but the portions were large enough to satisfy & the tempura was light with a nice crunch. Food gets a four star from me."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Mississauga. The wait for takeout is ridiculous though. I've picked up from here many times and the wait is usually at least 20 mins. Once I waited 1.5 hours. They start making the rolls once I get there. That being said it's great sushi."}
{"text":"Hinote, please expand! I'll even help you search for a new location. I will help with the set-up, clean, cook, serve, whatever it takes.

ILU ! 

SO MUCH"}
{"text":"I made this account to warn others about this restaurant.

Decided to check out new sushi places and 0/10 would recommend going here. The food was alright (not great for the price $$) and the service was the WORSE I've ever received. If I could give 0 stars, I would. The menu is old and disgusting, and very MISLEADING. **We ordered \"kame sushi\" which at the top says it comes with salad, miso soup, and rice. When everything except the rice arrived I asked the waitress for our rice. She then tells me the \"rice\" that's included is the rice in our sushi (yes, she pointed to the rice under the fish). After arguing with me for 5 minutes that rice is not included even though I tried to settle it. Her co-worker then comes and gives us our rice and pulls our server away.*** 

Never once did she check up on us after that and showed super salty attitude when asked for the bill. Our bill came to $40.52 and we paid $45 (We decided a 10% tip was adequate in this situation.) Our server runs out AND CHASED US DEMANDING FOR MORE TIP). How unbelievable!!!!!!! \"This is not even 10% tip\" as we left $4.48 tip. I stared at her seriously questioning her math skills and handed her whatever change I had with me. 

Overall TERRIBLE experience with RUDE staff."}
{"text":"One of my go-to a la carte sushi restaurants in Mississauga (though I haven't been to too many at this point). Comparing this to other a la carte Sushi shops, Hinote is always consistent in their dishes. 

Interior: it's a decently sized restaurant with lots of seating. The staff is always kind and attentive. The restaurant is also very clean with a clear view to the sushi chefs.

Food: The rolls are quite large and always packed with more ingredients than rice. A perfect rice to filling ratio. They also use very fresh ingredients including the raw fish. I personally don't like raw fish due to the fishy taste but Hinote uses good ingredients that don't have this. I can say I actually enjoy it because of this.

Their hot dishes are tasty and always fresh. The tempura is delicious and light on the batter, just like it should be. The bento boxes are also good with plenty of food to fill you.

Value: depending on what you order, the rolls can be a bit on the expensive side. I ordered a Super Dragon Roll (dragon roll with eel and avocado on top) which set us back $19. It was decently sized but I wasn't full at the end of it. It would have been better priced closer to $12 or $13. I still return because of the great food though."}
{"text":"The spicy salmon rolls here rule my world.  It's an extra $2.00 or something to sub the spicy rolls from regular rolls, but for a toonie it's sooooo worth it.  My hubby actually dreams about them.  Mmmmmm...

Everything else IMHO is standard, but all of the rolls are very good but very big (in terms of authentic Japanese maki rolls the rolls at Hinote would be considered too big as they require two bites).  Order accordingly however, because it can be very easy to order too much when you don't realize how big the rolls are.  

Deep fried bananas are served at the end of the meal on the house-I always eat one even though I really don't like them.  The honey sauce on them is always too sweet, but who can resist fruit on a stick?"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi and great service!  The pieces are large but very good quality.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The sushi are ok, nothing impressive, there are so many better places out there in the downtown area. It's too pricey compared with the food and service that you are getting. With a family of 4, the bill is over $100, I would rather go to heart sushi next time."}
{"text":"Went here with a couple friends on new years eve. We ordered spicy salmon roll, seared salmon roll and spicy red Dragon roll. The portions were huge and very filling. Our friends ordered tuna roll, Spider roll and a sashimi tray. Again, the portions were very big. It took quite a while to get our food but they gave us this deep fried salmon dish for free. They were really good with serving us tea. At the end of the meal they gave us a cinnamon tea which was surprisingly delicious. The pricing is average for a sushi place. Special rolls were ~$13-15. I would definitely recommend this place,  just be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"I haven't had very much experience with sushi in a few years thanks to a bad food poisoning incident however a few coworkers of mine couldn't stop talking about this place, one of them brought a dish for me to try. 

W
O
W

I got the chirashi bowl which has a mixture of different raw fish on a bed of rice (definitely not your average rice either) I JUST ABOUT MELTED FROM THE FRESHNESS OF THE FISH. I can't even properly explain except say that it's been about two weeks and my pallet still remembers and craves it. It's seriously delicious and you just need to go and try it."}
{"text":"good food, menus need to be updated, the prices lited are not necesarily accurate. kinda inconvenient for the customer if the owner is trying to save a buck on re-making the aged, tatered menus."}
{"text":"First things, I went to this place years ago, so how is my review still valid? Because my first experience wasn't enough to draw me back to the place at all. Really, it's between 2.5 and 3 for me.

I went to this place for my birthday, got a reservation. That should have been fine but I came to the place to find that they reserved my table under the name of Eric. Being asian, I am kind of used to this, but I didn't expect this coming from a restaurant.

Never mind that though, I was excited to try this place and see what all the hype is. Forgot what we ordered exactly but we got one of those big sushi boat party trays and we each got our own dishes. I got Katsu Don, and with respect to the food, the taste was definitely there, the freshness was definitely felt. It was nice to get sushi that wasn't just mediocre.

However, what really turned me off about this restaurant was the cost and value of everything. I know the food quality is better, but it was at the level of a mid class western restaurant. Not that they can't, but the portions did not match the cost. My Katsu Don was pretty darn tiny. Each dinner entree is around $20. Yes, so for a measly few extra dollars, you can find a good japanese buffet that matches your standard and get way more.  Furthermore, the interior atmosphere was not fitting of the type of money you pay there, it was only like the typical japanese restaurant.

Coming in groups, you can easily expect to spend near the $100s range and more. Frankly, I am probably still more comfortable going to a decent japanese buffet, even if they put a little bit more rice in their rolls, etc... Service was okay.

When I left the place, I didn't have any big impressions, maybe just because I didn't order the \"better\" stuff like a real entree. But aside from the quality of food, everything about this place is typical."}
{"text":"Best quality sushi in Mississauga but service is almost unforgivable.. they gave away our reservation this weekend which really irked us..  

It's almost always better to order takeout unfortunately :("}
{"text":"Awesome and fresh sushi! My favorite thing to order from here is their spider rolls and the boat! Reasonably priced and great for mississauga. :)"}
{"text":"It's ranking mississauga's best Japanese food which totally not true. Sashimi not fresh and it's run by Korean. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was a year ago and the food was great so I decided to go again yesterday with my parents. Big mistake.

We ordered the large sashimi appetizer, beef teriyaki with tempura and sushi combo, unagi don, and katsu don. First off, the sashimi appetizer only had 3 kinds of fish: salmon, white tuna, and tuna. Not only was it not fresh, there was no variety whatsoever. The beef teriyaki was bland, dry, and overcooked. It was served on a bed of bean sprouts and onions that was also bland. I wish I took a picture of the beef teriyaki because it was honestly a joke. There were 5 slices and this was supposed to be a dinner portion too. This was not worth $24. The katsu don was basically deep fried flour with very little meat in the middle. The unagi don was ok, but there was practically no rice.

Customer service wasn't great either, it took the servers forever to take our order and it wasn't even busy. They would acknowledge us then forget and do something else. 

We would have been better off going to an all you can eat instead for the price we paid for this disappointing meal, and I'm sure the quality of the food would have been better as well. Definitely won't return and won't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Fresh  sushi  enjoyed the atmosphere  overall.  Very  busy  during the  lunch  hours the spicey  salmon  was my  favourite"}
{"text":"You cannot compare this place to an AYCE joint. The quality is OUTSTANDING. The sashimi pieces are huge and fresh. Based other Yelp reviews, we ordered spicy salmon roll, unagi sushi, sashimi plater, udon noodles, dynamite roll, hinote roll, and salmon skin roll. I highly recommend ** the hinote roll. If you don't like sushi, the udon is quite good. We were offered complimentary miso soups with our meal. I made a reservation saying it was my grandmothers birthday however they do not do anything special. Service is mediocre. Walked in with no greeting at all! This place gets busy during dinner time. Service was inattentive by the older waitress however the younger waitress was bubbly, enthusiastic, and great!"}
{"text":"For Mississauga, this is the only place to go to for Sushi! After numerous disappointing finds this one is worth your time and money. Hinote is always busy so a walk in often greets you with a bit of a wait but worthwhile.

The menu is extensive and often overwhelming however there is plenty of time to look as service is slow. The food is extremely fresh and the portions are generous. You wont find sushi rolls that are all rice! One of the few places that actually gives you a generous quantity of fish/filling.

Hands down the Spicy Sushi Roll is the item to order. Everyone that's tried it loved it!

The sashimi offerings are extensive and very fresh. I have also enjoyed the Red Dragon, Green Dragon and the fried squid.

As a repeat guest, I have noticed many items are given on the house. Anything from Salmon Teriyaki, fried bananas or green tea ice cream.

I have learned to accept the slower service and you will never see a server just standing. This place is packed and for good reason.

Although a bit pricer than most sushi restaurants this one actually serves great food and you don't leave feeling like you ate bowls of rice or leave hungry.

Sushi cravings be gone!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and had an overall enjoyable experience!  The restaurant is small, but cozy and clean.  Service was friendly and fast.  We ordered the medium sashimi and sushi tray, and it was just the right amount for two people!  My only complaint is that the tray doesn't come with miso soup or salad, which is commonly offered at other restaurants.  Would come back! ;)"}
{"text":"It is definitely high quality and very fresh in terms of their sushi, however, compared to other restaurants in the area, it is generally more expensive than what you pay for at other Japanese restaurants. For example, their entrees are mainly over $10 (if it is cooked ie. teriyaki). If you want sushi/sashimi, it is usually $15-20 per entree.

It's a small place that's busy during weekdays for lunch, probably because of attracting a business crowd in the area. Lunch specials are worth taking advantage of - so I can see why it's especially busy at that time! Dinner is a lot more expensive, over $20/person so I can see why lunch is the more popular choice.

Fantastic spicy salmon rolls. Bento boxes were also tasty.  

I docked a star because quantity-for-price is not so great. If not for the price, I'd be a regular for sure."}
{"text":"Had sushi here again, almost a year after I visited.

Honestly one of my favourite places in Mississauga for relatively cheap and high-quality sushi! Unlike Sushi Tei, where the fish is dry, chewy, and stringy, the salmon here is so moist, flavourful, and literally melts in your mouth! I thoroughly savoured and enjoyed my sashimi lunch, which cost only $12.95. On that note, the pricing is slightly odd at this place whereby curry costs more than sushi... so if you love fish like me, definitely order it here!

Also, the California roll is quite good too. I thought we'd have a choice for the three pieces that come with our set (California or salmon), and though apparently not, I wasn't disappointed. Some may not like it, however, as they use quite a fair bit of avocado.

Two major complaints:
First, they were so busy that day that my family kind of got shafted to one side. Customer service was pretty bad, though that was mainly from one waitress only. I understand that things can get stressful, but she was quite dismissive of comments and even refused to look up to acknowledge our calling at one point. Good thing the other waitress came by with a smile.
Second, and this is very minor, but I found their finger to be overly salty. Wasn't too effective as a palate cleanser, but oh well!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars. Small place, reservations recommended. Fast service. Nice decor. Not all-you-can-eat, which is nice. Prices are slightly higher than average. Food is on par with most sushi places in the region. After finishing meal, asked if a dessert came with it. Was informed that complimentary after dinner item was no longer deep fried banana, in fact It is no longer available at Hinote. Now replaced with a hot beverage, cinnamon tea which was flavourful and good."}
{"text":"This restaurant has THE best sushi in Mississauga, let alone anywhere in the GTA. I have yet to taste anything that even compares, and that is saying a lot, seeing as how I love trying new sushi joints in and around Toronto. You definitely get your money's worth. Two rolls is more than enough for one person (I can never finish them); more suitable for two. The portions are huge and the fish is always fresh. I go at least once a week, if not more. I don't always dine in, but often call ahead for pick-up. It's ready, typically, within 10 minutes. I go so often that I don't even need to look at the menu.

The spicy salmon roll and the dynamite roll are a MUST. The dynamite roll is especially  tasty: huge portion of fillings inside (tempura shrimp, cucumber, krab, avocado, salmon roe, etc.) with deep-fried tempura bits on the outside. A bite gives you the perfect amount of freshness from the avocado and cucumber, the crunchiness of the tempura bits, and the warmness of the \"just out of the fryer\" tempura. Yum! 

Again, too much for me to handle, so I opt for the spicy salmon salad accompanied with either one. 

I also tried the bulgogi roll, the spicy tuna roll, and the tuna/tomato roll (Don't order this; tomato makes it watery (?), if that makes sense). These rolls are okay. I'd rather stick with the \"go-to's\".

My boyfriend hates sushi so he always orders the chicken yaki udon/fried noodles. I've grown to liking it, although I've tasted better (like at Sushi Tei), and I guess the fact that he drenches it in Sriracha hot sauce, makes it taste more flavourful. 

I give the restaurant a 4 out of 5 only because I PRAISE the sushi, but all other dishes are mediocre. Everything else on the menu you can get better elsewhere, i.e terriyaki, rice dishes, noodles, etc. I have yet to try their hand rolls or order a sushi boat, but from what I've seen, they look promising. 

A definite try. You won't be disappointed.

*Cheers*"}
{"text":"I would rate them a 3.5 overall for my 1st experience and their sushi portion sizes.

During my 1st visit, we were rudely turned away at the door because they were at capacity. I was with 3 children so I didn't bother waiting for a seat.

My 2nd visit was today. The sashimi is fresh - you get large pieces. Sushi was average - they are a bit too big. You cant pop it all in your mouth and enjoy the flavors together. My fave sushi was the kamakazi."}
{"text":"Very passable sushi place for Mississauga. I come from markham area so this is really a 3 star in comparison to the better ones(non-chinese) operated ones."}
{"text":"Great food, no doubt.The only place i go if i'm not feeling AYCE. Great for Dynamite or spicy red dragon , or spicy salmon salad. The spicy salmon roll and unagi roll is just mediocre. 

Be warned, there are only 2 chefs and 2 waitresses and a definite a lack of attention. We were a group of 5 and they only had 1 occupief table that could accommodate our group so we were asked to wait (it wasn't a full house.. Just needed that table to leave)

We waited for 35 minutes before we kindly asked again if we could be seated/if they could rearrange the tables for us. The waitress asked again how many our group were.... (The 5 of us stood awkwardly in the front this whole time). Anyway the answer was: no, she cannot rearrange the tables and asked us to wait some more. 

Another 10 minites passed and we finally begged to sit because we were absolutely starving. We sat down at a booth and they pulled up a chair (why didn't they do this earlier?) It was 9:25 and we order. Just as they gave us the food they gave the bill at the same time and said they were closing at 10... Take what you will from that, it was a bit irritated. 

Anyhow, this is not unusual. I've been there a handful of times and everytime i think to myself i would rather get take out and eat in my car or go somewhere else that welcomes larger groups

I hate writing bad reviews... I really do. I worked in the food industry so i have a high level of respect for it but there have been more than a couple disappointing visit to Hinote."}
{"text":"Amazing!  From the service to the food to the attention to detail.... all of it!  Was here on a business lunch, fairly large group of 7.  Very prompt attention, food was prepared very quickly.  SO fresh and delicious!  

We ordered a bunch of different rolls, all really great, some tempura, very yummy and a couple of plates of Sashimi.  Best sushi I've had in Mississauga to date.

The staff here are so attentive, they even gave us special \"dessert tea\" at the end (their compliments) and when we were leaving they provided us all with a free container of their home made salad dressing (in a very nice glass and metallic jar) How nice is that?!  They said it was their Christmas present to us :)

Will definitely be going back to this place, I recommend you check it out."}
{"text":"So Folks we went to Honite about a month ago, we were a party of four, so I made a reservation in advance and specifically asked for a booth, When I made the reservation the person answered the phone (owner) stated she was not sure if we could get the booth, this was a little weird because I was booking about two weeks before the dinner date.
However the day of the dinner I called early to ask if they accepted Debit and if we ended up getting the booth or not, she the same person namely Mia, stated yes it was confirmed.

So we show up 5 minute before the reserved time, stepped inside, No host or host table. Ok! So we walked ourselves in. No one says hello or anything. So at last I hailed down a server, I said we have a reservation for 8 pm and we requested for a booth, the owner came out from the back, and said the booth is not available, and she is not sure when the party who were dining will be done. So now I am kind of annoyed, as we took our sister in law and her boy friend to dinner for the 1st time

So we just had to settle for the window table, the service was prompt and ok  
Now the main reason of going, the food, I have to say it was pretty descent, it didn't blow me out of the water, but it was good, the Fish was fresh, but one of the person at our table who was from California, did not like the Sushi/Sashimi/Maki or even the Saki.  

The conclusion is I would go back, but not a for a double date night, rather I would just go there to grab a bite and not expect any service 

FOOD 4 STARS
SERVICE in totality 2 STARS, only because  the server was decent 
PRICE 4 STARS ( 4 PEOPLE+$150)
AMBIANCE: 3 STARS"}
{"text":"I'm really torn about this review. 

I love the food here! It was my second time today. First time service was standard for busy lunch hour. Today at 2pm service was quite slow and poor. 

I ordered the cod lunch special and just as a heads up - all you will get is a cod and some coriander (plus the miso and salad which is included with all lunch menu orders).

My colleagues all loved the food as I highly recommended this place. 

Here is the deal breaker: they charged us $2 for literally what was 3 tablespoons of spicy mayo. Not once but twice! We were not advised that it would be additional. On my first visit, they did not charge this. On my second visit they did and did it twice. I get it; costs have gone up. I can justify a $0.99 or even $1.50 charge but $2 with no warning! Unbelievable considering they literally gave us very little which is why we had to ask for another.

Undecided if I will return."}
{"text":"This is probably the best fresh sushi I have ever tried in Mississauga. The spicy salmon roll is very yummy, with less rice and more fish. The sashimi is so tender and fresh."}
{"text":"$8 for this small spicy salmon roll. The spicy seafood udon also had no seafood and when we complained they only added 2 shrimps and a mussel to it. Very overpriced"}
{"text":"I love the food here.. Well just sushi. I had kalbee one time and I had to return it because it was so chewy and undercooked.

I'm not giving this place 2 stars because of that one undercooked kalbee dish (since their sushi taste amazin but I am giving this place 2 stars because service here is terrible.  I went there with three of my friends and we all ordered sushi. My two friends ordered one large sushi/sashimi boat to share and my boyfriend got sushi/sashimi dinner.  I ordered sashimi donburi.  My friends all got their food and my food was not coming out so I asked the server and she says, \"yes, yes it's coming\". She looked annoyed that I asked as if waiting 10 mins after all my friends got the food is impatiency from my end? Anyways, so I told my friends to start eating since I guess I am getting my food soon? 

I didn't get my food until my friends finished eating that's all I have to say.. and they didn't apologize until I asked the manager..."}
{"text":"Giving this place 1 star is way too high. These were the worst employees I have ever come across in my life. The sushi chef told me to be quiet and the waitress was being oblivious to us even complaining and kept walking past us as if we were invisible. All i wanted was a refund for the disgusting sushi they presented us there container couldnt even close the fish smelled. It took us half and hour to get our money back and while getting trying to get a refund were given a nasty attitude by all 3 employees. Also who charges 2 dollars for spicy mayo? I recommend no one ever come to this place it was horrible."}
{"text":"Pricey but worth it.  Very fresh, nicely prepared and some different touches - for example a thin slice of avocado on the unagi.  Service ok, nothing special.  Disappointed they use fake crab, but hard to find one that doesn't."}
{"text":"In my opinion  the best sushi in Mississauga. Fish is very fresh and portions are large. Service is always great when I come there. Only problem is some of the rolls are too big and hard to eat."}
{"text":"Before I begin, I just want to say the sushi here is amazing, but the service is not so much. 

Location
I visited Hinote last Friday for dinner with a party of 6 for the first time. 
The restaurant itself is quite small and busy so it was a must that we made reservations beforehand.
The menus could have used a bit of a pick-me-up and many of them seemed to have been water damaged, making them very difficult to read.

Service 
While I understand it was busy, we were sitting for over 20 minutes and not a single staff member approached our table since seating. Throughout the dining experience, it became apparent to us that we would be completely ignored unless we flagged someone down.
I'd suggest Hinote think about installing some type of service bell so that this process could be made easier. 
Or perhaps they should have more waiting staff on to keep up with the busy weekend service.

Food
We ordered the XL sushi boat, an udon soup, miso soups, and later after seeing someone else eating it, a kalbi dinner set. 
The udon soup and miso soup came out quite quickly and were perfect. 
The sushi however, took about 40 minutes to assemble.
When it did come out however it was massive and was a good size for 6 people. 
The quality of their sushi is amazing. Definitely one of the best, if not the best in Mississauga. 
Everything tasted fresh and was expertly plated on the sushi boat. 
The Kalbi we later ordered also came out quickly and was quite oily but also very good. 
I'd definitely recommend ordering the sushi and kalbi here. 
The cost of the dinner here is a bit more expensive than your typical sushi establishment. 
Moreover, very few things were complimentary. I was used to receiving a side of miso soup, salad, and ice cream at the end of the meal. 
This is not the case at Hinote. Other than some of the dinner sets, everything must be ordered separately and can really add up. 
However, we did receive a sort of ginger tea, that was a bit too sweet for my liking, but the rest of the table quite enjoyed. 

CONCLUSION
The Good: Sushi and Kalbi is amazing quality. Overall, their food is very good and is presented beautifully. 
The Bad: Service was non-existent and slow. Possibly would be better on a weekday or with a smaller party. Also, the price is a bit more steep than other sushi establishments."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for sushi. The atmosphere is cozy and the food is always consistent and delicious. This place gets full during the rush hours of lunch and dinner so I recommend coming a bit earlier. I would consider this place a tiny bit more pricey than others but I believe it is worth it for the quality you receive."}
{"text":"If your interest In maki (sushi rolls) this is the place for you.

I came here for mothers birthday, my mom loves this place but I can probably only see this as average. 

The price is great if you only order fish! Skip the teriyaki go straight for the maki, sushis and sashimis. The fish is very fresh and so incredibly tender, the maki rolls are huge and filled. The sashimi is cut not at all thin, gives you a generous bite of fishy goodness.The 28 dollars you get a boat of fish! 

They also serve Tuna Belly during this season shipped from Japan, I highly suggest anybody to give it a try because it melts in your mouth like butter. 

However...

The Teriyaki is a bit disappointing, lacks a lot of flavor and served strangely on a white plate. The chicken cooked well but lacks a kick of flavour. 

They also don't serve sushi soy sauce which is a slightly sweeter version of soy sauce which is a little sad. 


CONCLUSION: I will be coming back! The boat is my next mission."}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi restaurant for a la carte. Top quality rolls (my favorite is the spicy salmon and calamari roll). I've never tried sushi as fresh as from here. Only deducting one star because customer service could improve."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Mississauga! Well proportioned sushi and excellent quality sashimi. Lunch was well worth it, I always have the sushi bento box with tempura as honestly they have the best tempura I've ever had. If you're going for dinner, their rolls are HUGE! That's probably why they are pricey."}
{"text":"This got to be the best sushi place in the Mississauga area!  Fresh, reasonable price.  I almost always go for the chirashi sashimi dinner.  I never turned my husband to eat that too now.  Their rolls are unique and yummy.  I go there almost every other week.  Service is great too."}
{"text":"This place is average to me and I really wanted to love it. I have not found a great sushi place in the GTA yet that matches Vancouver caliber. I found it expensive for the amount of food you get and quality of sushi/sashimi. Over $100/2 people dinner.

Service - good
Taste & freshness - average
Value - below average, really small portions 
Ambiance - okay cosy

Dishes ordered:
Salad - taste bland, not as good as some of the authentic Japanese restaurants I've tried
Tempura - 4 small bits, i feel a bit riped off
miso soup - watery, not much in broth
Sushi  & sashimi - not fresh, hard to eat, rice stale
Tea - had the burnt barley flavour, not a fan, I prefer the traditional Japanese green tea

Will not return for another try"}
{"text":"It is an small Sushi Restaurant, well located with a good variety of sushi, also offers a Lunch menu for a descent price, which includes soup, salad and a main dish.
The sushi was fresh and portions are ok, will come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Ambiance: 3/5 
Food: 5/5
Service: n/a

After all the reviews, I had to check this place out.  Yelp doesn't lie! I did takeout and ordered the yellow tail sashimi and something called a Super Dragon Rolls. The sashimi was pretty good, but the Super Dragon Rolls - huge, but mouth watering. Eel, avocado, other stuff and melted it in your mouth.  I did take out so I've never dined in, so I can't comment about the service. I hope they don't have bad service or else it'd be a shame."}
{"text":"This is one of my family's favorite places to go for Japanese food in Mississauga.  The sushi is very fresh and every dish is well made.   The black cod is made with a slightly sweet, miso flavor and melts in your mouth.  I usually get the sushi lunch special (pic below) or the black cod."}
{"text":"I have only ever been here for lunch, and it's ALWAYS busy. For example, today... it's training out. It's crappy.. when I left at 1pm, there was a lineup AND people standing outside IN THE RAIN waiting to get in the lineup inside. Crazy.

Fish is fresh, rolls are really good and HUGE and yes,  you will spend more than you usually do for maki elsewhere. To me, it's worth it because I always leave full and the flavours are rounded out in each roll so that you're not craving something else when you leave.

I have had the spicy salmon/tuna, Kamakazi roll (amazing, and has a house 'french' sauce on the plate that's sweet with a bit of chilli pepper or something). I've also ordered the salmon skin roll which I loved. The Dynamite roll is massive. It's a two biter for sure (and I know that's wrong). but it's so big in your mouth (insert joke here) that you almost choke (insert other joke here).  They also bring the little bottle of japanese chili pepper to your table which is AWESOME. When I make maki at home, I always put the chili pepper stuff in my mayo. They earn extra bonus points from me for that :) 

My friend and I ordered three rolls today: Dynamite, Salmon Skin and Kamakazi with edemame and the total was $43 with tax. A little pricey yes, but I didn't leave hungry. 

I must admit the service is terrible at lunch. It took us forever to get the servers attention to pay.  There were only two working and clearly they need at least three to take care of the rush. It's not a big place but man does it get jammed."}
{"text":"Spicy salmon roll is the best! Also generous cuts of sashimi. Excellent neighborhood sushi place if you don't feel like driving out."}
{"text":"Warning:  Better off going to all-you-can-eat sushi for the price!!

 The first time i had sushi there before, It wasn't fresh. The services wasn't great either. I came back to try it out the second time, hoping it would be better this time around. Since my friends live only a few minutes away from the restaurant. 
Should of stuck to my guts feeling...
The service was awful.  Gave me a glass of soy sauce  instead of apple juice.  I noticed the color of the liquid was completely black. Without tasting it, i asked the owner for a new one. She refused, told me its apple juice and started shouting at me. One of my friend asked her to taste it if she doesn't believe us. After being loud and rude to my friends and I. She got her husband to try it. In the end, it was soy sauce. Didn't get any apologies from the wife but instead heard her shouting at her workers in the back. 
Arguments was unnecessary ..really killed the mood to eat anything."}
{"text":"Great tasting food.  Ordered 4 specialities rolls for a quick snack.  Pieces were kinda large, so you need a big mouth for the one bit technique."}
{"text":"Decided to check this out after craving some good sushi. Hinote doesn't disappoint as their quality is quite good! We ordered the Hinote Special Roll and the Hinote Plate, shared amongst 3 people. We obviously weren't full by the end of it but we all agreed that it was some of the best sushi we've had in a while. My only gripe about this place is the service, it could be a little better."}
{"text":"Visited on a rainy day with my boss and a co-worker for a lunch.

Ordered the salmon special lunch set and overall enjoyed my meal.

The starter miso soup was a perfect way to warm up on a chilly gloomy day.

Food arrived quickly and seemed to be prepared with care. I enjoyed the lunch and have no complaints, fish seemed to be of very good quality. Our server was polite and prompt.

I really liked the cinnamon tea they provided at the end of the meal! I sometimes don't enjoy green tea, so this was a refreshing offering.

It's also worth noting the restaurant was super clean, always a good thing!

Would definitely return again."}
{"text":"The freshest sushi you will find in Mississauga, that's for sure! I've tried a lot of sushi places and none can even compare with Hinote. My favourite rolls are the red dragon, spicy salmon, and spider. You have to give this place a try! But make sure to get there as soon as they open or call to reserve a table..the place fills up very quickly"}
{"text":"I would give this 3.5 stars.

I had a 13 piece sushi dinner. It came with a salad and miso soup, both were delicious and I was surprisingly stuffed after finishing it (I was thinking of ordering another 6 rolls before my food came!)
I really liked the sushi with the salmon on top and ball of rice underneath (I don't know what it's called, but it was delicious!). The rest I found good, but a bit too much wasabi for my liking.

With the meal you have a choice of 3 salmon or california rolls. I chose salmon. They looked awesome. They didn't taste as amazing as they looked, the way it fell apart in my mouth wasn't pleasant but I'm just being picky.

We didn't get refills on our green tea and it was surprisingly busy (such a small place).

I liked this place but I like Sushi House in Brampton better if I am going to non-AYCE.

My two girlfriends and I shared a deep fried banana at the end. I had an overall good experience at this place. I would only go back if I was in the area because there are so many other places to go.

Our server was a little slow on taking our orders but friendly and the food came out quickly."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the best sushi restaurant in the GTA.  

It's in a surprising location, tucked away in a drab mini-mall in Mississauga, but we look for excuses to drive out their to visit this place.

The sushi is as fresh as can be, and every menu item is delicious.  I recommend the sashimi dinner or a bento box.  The spicy tuna or salmon rolls are very good."}
{"text":"After debating between Burger King and Popeye's Chicken, we ended up at Hinote Sushi (I just can't stomach BK and we just had PFK in the weekend). It's located in a small plaza right off Mavis Road sitting alongside such esteemed peers like Little Caesar's and Pho Fuzion (seriously). 

It was pretty full which is a great sign since it's (1) winter and butt-cracking cold, (2) Monday and (3) winter in Mississauga. We were seated and green tea'd right away. One of the servers was carrying a boatload of sushi towards a table of 5. That's a good sign to me. 

We ordered a small sushi boat (16 pieces of assorted sushi and sashimi), a combination dinner (beef teriyaki with rice, shrimp and veggie tempura, california roll), avocado salad, miso soup and regular salad. Avocado salad was really good and creamy. Sushi and sashimi was fresh and tasty. They didn't load a ton of rice into the sushi. The wasabi was tame and lame. Hardly any heat at all. The beef teriyaki was too done for our liking (We prefer medium rare. We got medium well) and the accompanying veggies were a still slightly raw. Tempura was really light, crispy and perfectly cooked. We declined dessert because we didn't even finish our sushi boat but they gave us bite-sized deep fried banana fritters with drizzled honey on top. It was a nice touch.

Food was ok - 3
Service was good - 4
Price was a tad too much in comparison to other like restaurants - 3"}
{"text":"Had been coming here for many years, good quality and fresh food. Recommend reservations for busy time like dinner.
Not the all you can eat restaurant."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi restaurants in the City, not sure why it's in Mississauga...lucky I work sort of close by now, otherwise I'd get to enjoy it less.  Their sushi is always fresh (at least every time that I've been).  They have gotten busier over the years, so there's is sometimes a wait for a table.

I love the sashimi dinner, the spicy sauce is amazing and the sashimi rose is so cute.  The portion size is huge - order if starving!  Their spicy salmon roll and spicy tuna roll is also great.  My bf often gets a dinner combo, so far the bulgogi, tempura, and teriyakis have all been good.

Downside, closed on Sundays.  We bring our out of town guests here, and they agree that the sushi here is better than places in L.A.!"}
{"text":"Menu is disgusting and it looks like it's been soak with water. 
In the menu, all the dinner entre has miso soup and salad. We ordered a medium boat which it's considered more than 2 dinner entre and there was no soup or salad. The wait time is long like 30 mins. Since there is no soup, we just drink the complimentary tea which tastes worst than my home tab water. Then when we saw the sushi boat. The colour of the fish was off. The way the \"chef\" cut the fish and roll is not professional. At the end, we asked for a cheque. The waitress asked us if we want cinnamon tea? Would it be better if they offered miso soup instead of that! I went to over 30 sushi restaurants around GTA. Even the one in the mall, they offer you either a bottle of water or miso soup.  Not recommended"}
{"text":"A nice cozy japanese restaurant.  The spicy salmon roll was filled with chunks of salmon and very fresh and filling.  The kalbi dinner was great, it was cooked just right and not too raw or coarse.  The place is small so it gets packed quickly.  They are closed on sundays as well."}
{"text":"I've actually been coming back here for a few years now. The menu is pretty standard, and they use fresh ingredients. I also like the fact that they offer the lunch special menu on Saturdays too (they're closed on Sundays). 

I had the sashimi lunch box with salmon rolls for $1 extra. It came with a salad, miso soup, some generously slices sashimi, some nigiri sushi, and small pieces of spicy cabbage which I assumed was supposed to be kimchi. It tasted a lot lighter and not as salty as the traditional kimchi. The bulgogi box has nicely marinated and grilled beef with rice along with some sushi. They also offer you some sweet cinnamon tea at the end of your meal, which is a nice touch. 

Service is quick and efficient. Ambience is quiet with some tables and comfy booth seats."}
{"text":"Good food but it's pricey and comes with terrible service.

Waited 15 minutes to get served after I was seated. The staff didn't even acknowledge mine and my fiancée's presence. She tried to flag them down a few times and they just said, \"sorry, can you wait please?\"

I am not coming back here again..."}
{"text":"Huge sushi fan and I must say I have tried many places in Mississauga. In my opinion I will call Hinote the best sushi I've had YET. 

Amazing taste, and big portions. You definitely see, feel and taste the difference compared to an all you can eat place. Prices are fair and presentation is nice.

The place is a bit small but it doesn't bother me at all. I highly recommend this place you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Mississauga gem! Top tip: ALWAYS go for lunch--way cheaper, same quality. Plus, if you order one of the lunch specials you're destined to get the cinnamon tea at the end of your meal!

We ordered the Kalbi, tempura and sashimi lunches. All of what we ordered were delicious, fresh, and filling. If you're a big eater you may need to order an extra roll or two. Other than that, just be warned that they are usually packed during lunch, so come early to grab a seat. Prices range from 9-16 dollars on the lunch special menu, see pictures for details!"}
{"text":"Popped by for a late dinner on a Saturday night. Usually during dinner hours, the restaurant is incredibly full - they do take reservations though! We came around 8:30pm and it was much emptier which was nice. My husband and I both ordered a the sushi and sashimi plate, came with approximately 12 pieces. I also ordered an additional spicy salmon roll which I thought was needed however the 12 pieces were sufficient. The sushi is fresh, the service is warm and the food is prepared quickly. For their price point, the meal was great value. If you are in the area, you won't be disappointed that you stopped by!"}
{"text":"Great location and the service is ok and the sushi are fresh and perfect and it's little pricey but it worth it and you will enjoy the experience and great employees always nice !! So I high recommend this place !!"}
{"text":"The food was extremely mediocre. The service was extremely warming but they were also short staffed. The place is small, not recommended for a large group outing."}
{"text":"They have the biggest Hinote rolls ever! NO JOKE! i know its customary to eat it in one bite but you just simply can't! You really get what you paid for, they give you a huge chunk of tuna and salmon. Its okay..nothing special.

UNAGI DONBURI is a must try!!! I always wish there was more.

Customer service was ok. I feel like the servers aren't use to a busy full house. It's very hard to get their attention.

You can sit at the table or by the bar to watch the sushi chefs make the rolls. The ambience is cozy.

We got the cinnamon tea the last time but not recently. I still see people getting served that but i suspect that you must order the dinner combos that come with soup and salad to get the tea in the end. The Cinnamon tea is really good and is a sweet ending."}

I love coming to Hinote only for the maki (rolls). They're huge! So it's very filling and actually really tasty.

The other items on the menu are good as well but a little pricey for what they are. The salmon teriyaki was dry and nothing special.

And now coming to think of it, when we ordered the combos, we didn't even receive the tempura that should have come with Combo #4... :(

The service was mediocre. My family and I were seated for 15 minutes without tea or menus."}

I enjoy Hinote because it is a smaller establishment. It means that you might have to wait a little longer for service if there is a spike in people coming in all at once, but generally speaking, the service is good.

We came in for lunch at around 1:00 (opens at 12 on Saturday) and it was pretty quiet (3 tables including us). Not 20 minutes later, the place was pretty much filled.

I had the Black Cod Shoyaki special and my mom had the Sashimi Lunch special. We also ordered a Sushi Appetizer to share. The portions for sashimi were quite generous and the fish tasted quite fresh.

I hope Hinote stays around for the long run and their quality remains as high as it still is. I look forward to my next visit."}

First of all this place was packed for 12:45 PM on a Thursday afternoon.  Ordered a lunch special (salmon sashimi, salmon roll, salad, Cali roll) and damm was it good! Pieces cut were of good size and texture and quality was fresh.  It came with a Miso soup that was excellent, not too salty and nice broth!  When my meal was finished they gave a me a nice glass of some warm cider-tasting drink heavy on the cinnamon!  Wow that was a surprise as I've never had this before!  Let me say, I will be back when on Mavis again!  Craaaazy good!"}

{"text":"Noticing that Hinote Sushi got 4/5 stars for their sushi I decided to grab some lunch here with bestie/Yelper, Anson A.

There was only one person waiting tables for the entire restaurant so we just seated ourselves. Prices were more expensive than other sushi restaurants, however the ingredients used looked and tasted very fresh (y).

We ordered: salmon sashimi, california rolls, red dragon rolls, and the calamari rolls. The servings for the sashimi was pretty generous. They tasted great too! The rolls were quite big so it's kinda hard to fit an entire roll into your mouth. 

Overall, Hinote Sushi is an alright/decent place to grab some sushi but it's not on my top 3 list of places to fulfill any of my sushi cravings."}
{"text":"7th September - Terrible sushi,the quality has gone downhill tremendously. Been going to this place for many years and yesterday's meal was beyond disappointing. Have they changed owners? Very upset that will probably have to stop eating sushi in Mississauga"}
{"text":"As someone who eats ayce sushi alot more. I did not see the value, but i gave it a shot and was pleased.

Hinote is a small and quaint sushi restaraunt with a warm and inviting atmosphere. The the rolls and pieces are done very well.

Honestly its hard to differentiate from a la carte and all you can eat. But at Hinote you can tell the difference. Your food isnt rushed and made to be pumped out asap.

There is a little more care put into the pieces, for example the nigiri sushi i ordered had just a bite sized amount of rice. It did not fall apart and the fish draped over with a bit of hang for you to dip.
Most importantly each piece had a bit of wasabi underneath. This how nigiri is supposed to be. Alot of places dont do this anymore. Really good!

My only criticism is that the menu needs a face lift, some of the pages are starting to lose their words and this is hard to read.
The price is more than all you can eat so if your looking for quantity go for ayce. But if you want a teeny bit more authenticity and care then try Hinote.

With the over saturation of all you can eat spots. Hinote still manages to be a la carte and put out a more true sushi.  

Try the sushi sashimi dinner combo. ;)"}

{"text":"Music-only comment:  Maybe this \"review\" is unnecessary, but either the owners read my last review OR it was a pure coincidence that they didn't play either Adele/Norah Jones yesterday.

They listened soo well in fact that they played absolutely NOTHING during a busy, Saturday dinner service.  At one point, I thought I heard really faint music, but man, did the lack of a soundtrack make it FREAKIN' LOUD in the restaurant!!!  Not sure if it was the more-than-usual-younger-crowd/cranky babies, but I felt like I was at a concert...minus the music.

People were literally yelling over each other.  I could barely hear my bf and we both had to lean in to speak/hear to one another.

So never underestimate the power of background music, especially at a restaurant!"}
{"text":"this place is all right. i've experience better. i've had a hit and miss with the quality. it's also much pricier then usual but unfortunately is the only good convenient place in sauga for japanese for its quality. if you're already uptown or dt, no need to venture out here b/c it's definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"Sushi was decent, very expensive for location and environment. Service was very very bad. Waitress was rude. Had to pay $2 extra for spicy mayo. Will not come back or recommend."}
{"text":"It has been a few months since we visited this place, and they are obviously under new management.
I have to downgrade the rating for a few simple reasons: 
(1) I added the Avocado Salad, and it LITERALLY was a small bowl of cubed Avocado with their dressings. The dressing was good, BUT what happened to all those other greens?
(2) for the combo, switching from California roll to salmon roll is now another $1. Now, to be fair, it is a full size mini-roll instead of those pathetic bite-size ones.
(3) the Salmon Skin Roll USUALLY will have either BBQ or Terriyaki sauce in it....but it was literally crispy skin with avocado....it was dry and not much flavouring...
How disappointing."}
{"text":"Try going earlier in the dinner hour because there's usually a line up out the door later in the evening. At that point, the servers make little eye contact.. Always take the deep fried banana after dinner, it's free & always fresh. The service is hit or miss. I tend to order an item that's been off the menu for years now & they will always make it but I find the amount they charge me varies.. The sushi chefs are always friendly & will say hi to you before the servers do. I still go back regardless the service though because the food is amazing.. I highly recommend the: Dynamite Roll, Spicy Salmon Roll, Spicy Salmon Salad & Spider Roll."}

Meh. That's why I didn't give 5 stars. We ordered 9 items. The first 7 came in no time. The second last one took 2 reminders , and the last one came 30 mins after that. The waiter was apologetic, I think they mixed up orders and gave ours away to other tables. 

Food 
Best spicy salmon I've had... Hands down. Everything is fresh and good portion size. Fully satisfied. 

Id go back!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi spot in Mississauga. It's not very well known, kind of a neighborhood gem that I stumbled upon a few years back. Their sashimi is always so fresh and service is always amazing. It is a bit more on the pricey side though, and the restaurant is very small so I'd advise you to make reservations during peak hours."}
{"text":"Somebody was raving about this place and I got to finally try it this time. We shared Rainbow Roll, Dynamite Roll and Spicy Salmon Roll. Spicy Salmon Roll was quite different from other sushi restaurants, because this place put chunks of salmon sashimi instead of the typical bits of salmon and tempura mixture. The rolls were generally bigger than other sushi restaurants. They did not come with a bowl of miso soup or salad. I really enjoyed my Rainbow Roll, which had pieces of salmon, red tuna, white fish, cooked eel and avocado on top. Both sashimi and sushi here were very fresh, soft and tasty. I'd recommend their rolls.

The service was pretty attentive for a Korean-run restaurant. Waitresses kept providing us with more tea and water, and asked us if we needed anything. They gave us a complimentary hot cinnamon tea at the end of our meal. There was plenty of parking spaces available in the plaza. This place was very busy so make a reservation!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is by far the WORST sushi places my husband and I have been to. We go to many different sushi places so we are able to compare across the board - the service, food, price, quality, etc. 

First of all, we went for dinner on a Friday night, earlier in the evening around 6pm. There were only 2 servers in the entire restaurant, which was OK due to the size of the place. Or so I thought. Even with only minimal number of tables, the kitchen and sushi chefs we're not able to keep up with the demand of a dinner rush. My husband and I ordered two basic sushi dinner dishes and we waited for close to 45 minutes before only one of us (my husband) received his meal. When the first plate was put down in front of us, both of us immediately commented on how small the sushi rolls were. The slices of fish on top of the rice were very tiny and thin, and the sushi rice was the size of a cherry. The fish seemed ok, but was not the freshest compared to other restaurants. We waited another 20 minutes before my dinner was served and by that time my husband had already finished his tiny portion, so I basically had to eat dinner by myself. 

If the owner wanted to make the portion sizes smaller, that's their prerogative, however the prices should be reflecting that. When you first look at the menu it looks like average Japanese restaurant prices, but once we saw how small the portions were, the prices seemed too extravagant. Even the soup that was complementary with our meal was only half filled in the bowl.

Our bill ended up being close to $45 which we only left a 10% tip because the waitress didn't even come around once to fill our tea cups in the 1.5 hours we were there. NOT WORTH IT AT ALL. I would rate it 0/5 stars if it was possible. Considering how many other Japanese restaurants there are in Mississauga, there is no reason why one would have such poor service and quality. Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Considering this is more expensive than the average Japanese restaurant, you'd hope you have better quality fish, better variety, and great service. Nope, nope, and nope. The service is horrible. 

Our dinner took over 2 hours because we waited nearly 20 minutes to be acknowledge at our table. It also took nearly 20 minutes to get a cheque. We had to flag people down to get green tea refills (they didn't even try to refill it once on their own). The food is ok but not worth the price. Pedestrian sushi (just the typical salmon, white tuna, octopus, tuna, flounder, and california roll).  It's alright but plain and ordinary. It's not as good as Kumai or as plentiful as Dai Ichi. I would recommend both before this place. I would not return back at all."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place because I was in the area and because of all the great reviews this place has gotten.  We came here on a Saturday evening and we realized pretty quickly that this place was super busy.  Once we walked through the door there were already people waiting in the small waiting area.  I realized they were waiting for a table for a larger group of people.  My boyfriend and I decided to go inside and let someone know that we wanted a table for 2 and if they had any tables available.  

As we are standing there no one acknowledged us, did not even come up to greet us.  We waited about 5 min. until we just went up to one of the waitresses and asked for a table for 2.  She told us \"we do not have any tables available\" okay.... So we asked \"how long is the wait\"
she then says, \"I don't know.\" Great. No approximate time given, nothing.  We weren't even asked to give her our name to put on a list for people who are waiting for a table.  How are you supposed to know who to seat next if you don't have a system of waiting people who are eager to eat???

We ended up leaving because they clearly looked flustered and I just did not have the patience to deal with ridiculous service that already started from the moment we walked in.

I'm not sure it's worth coming back to try their food as this place turned me off from the get go.  It's such a shame as I read a lot of great reviews from here but I guess it just wasn't their day."}
{"text":"Location was good but it was somewhat difficult to find the entrance because they have the shutters down which made the inside look dark/store closed. Once inside, the decor was decent. The restaurant was not crowded and we had no wait on a Sunday night.

The owners and servers are Korean but that didn't stop them from providing good Japanese sushi. We ordered a 40 piece sashimi platter and the dragon roll (a la carte). 

The sashimi was fresh and the assortment was good. There was a good amount of marbling and the sashimi definitely had a good fatty/umami taste to it without tasting old or slimy. The dragon roll was good - nothing special but nothing to complain about.

The price was quite high but considering we ordered nearly pure fish, it was understandable. At ~80$ after tax, for two people, it could be comparable to two weekend all you can eat meals at a sushi restaurant albeit of higher quality sashimi/sushi.

Overall, I would recommend this restaurant if you ever find yourself in Mississauga craving sushi/sashimi."}
{"text":"There are a lot of sushi places now and Hinote Sushi is simply another one of them. The restaurant setup was typical with some tables, booths and a sushi bar at the back. Nothing out of the ordinary. Not entirely a bad thing, but the same can be said about their sushi... nothing out of the ordinary.

The group I was with ordered a bunch of different rolls ranging from the classic spicy salmon and spicy tuna all the way to fancier rolls like the red dragon and seared salmon rolls.

What I did not like about Hinote sushi were the size of the rolls and the amount of spicy mayo used. I'm all for generous portions, which Hinote deserves credit for, but their Maki pieces were much too large to comfortably eat and enjoy. The piece would either fall apart because you would bite it, or, you can eat the whole thing at once but have a difficult time chewing. It'd be better if they served two normal size Maki pieces instead of one double sized piece that is hard to eat.

Also, in the spicy salmon and spicy tuna rolls, too much spicy mayo is used. The fish itself is decent but the amount of mayo overshadows the taste of the fish. When I eat sushi I like to taste the fish and the rice but these rolls tasted like spicy mayo was the main feature. It's not my thing but if it is yours, you might like this place more than me.

The one thing I really did enjoy was the cinnamon tea at the end of the meal. It was warm and just sweet enough to not taste like a dessert drink. Probably my favourite part of the meal.

Overall, Hinote is a decent sushi spot with really good cinnamon tea, but the Sushi here does not make me want to come back unless I am already in the area."}
{"text":"Sushi and teriyaki lunch goers can enjoy this little hotspot of a restaurant, with its simple dark decor, and central Mississauga location.

I am a sushi lover and I will base my review on what I believe should be the paramount category in any sushi review: the fish and the rice.

Sushi, sashimi and maki must be expertly cut, each slice hand selected by the master chef. Pieces must be cool enough but not frozen and small enough so one can enjoy each piece's individual flavour.

The sushi was ok, however I compared the freshness with that of an AYCE, or better and the maki rolls were so jumbo I could not fit them in my mouth without having to take a pause from talking to my fellow yelper. Jumbo sizes good for the suburbs, Probably. For my review: I think not. The rice was average too.

Meal breakdown:
Seaweed salad: not washed, smelt & tasted like fish

Rainbow roll: massive pieces of avocado overwhelming the rolls flavour

Salmon, tuna sushi: a little cold, good size pieces but missing some selection. I wish I tried to o'toro to compare with others I've tried.

I enjoyed the service which was normal for an Asian restaurant (aka kinda bad) and the ambiance although if it wasn't for the company I was with, my rating would have been lower.

A lot of yelpers say this is the best sushi in the GTA although I challenge that statement. Try Yuzu or Kaji or Japango

Jay lion out"}
{"text":"I understand that the reason people seem to like this restaurant is that it is small and seems personalized, that is, there are literally only 2 chefs making the sushi fresh to order. But with this comes so many more disadvantages, which I experienced during my visit. 
We got a table immediately upon entering and I noticed that there were only 2 servers and 2 chefs.
The menu had regular Japanese and a few Korean options but the prices were so much steeper than other sushi restaurants around. I decided to go for the chirashi bowl and my bro chose 2 different vegetarian rolls.
The place was getting filled up by the minute and the servers just could not keep up. They was a clear lack of attendance, whereby I had to call one personally to get some attention.
We waited and waited, watching sushi being made but none of which were ours. I think it had been 20 minutes until my chirashi bowl was served.
One of my biggest pet peeves is when one persons dish is served way earlier than the others. So basically I sat there starving while I had to wait out of politeness for my brothers meal to arrive. His one order of vegetarian roll arrived 15 minutes later and then his second one arrived another 10 minutes later. I ended up scarfing my food down because I was so hungry and therefore couldn't even enjoy the taste properly. I would like to add that the chirashi bowl was quite a small serving...but this may be my perception due to my sheer hunger.
Once done we had to call out for the bill several times, which took another 10 minutes to arrive.
So, overall I would say that this restaurant may be ok if you would like a slow, intimate dinner. But if you just want a regular meal and are hungry then this should not be an option. The sushi was good but not extraordinary and there are definitely places where you can get equal quality of sushi and a better service."}
{"text":"Mediocre.  Spider roll was really fishy.  Big portions of salmon sashimi though.  Hinote special roll was HUGE, if you know what I saying, know what I saying!"}
{"text":"There's just no beating Hinote.  It's truly the best non-AYCE and just hands down the best sushi place period that Mississauga's got.  Their spicy salmon rolls make me cry tears of joy, their kamikaze is a killer combination of spicy and sweet and their spicy salmon salad is *heavenly music* (I would order a salad more often if I didn't have such a big appetite).  Their forté is definitely their sushi menu because every time I tried to order an item from the kitchen I didn't enjoy it so much.  Staff are friendly, but kind of forgetful lol we just turn the service into a Dory joke *snort*, get it? But the food outweighs the service.  Also, two thumbs up for ambience --it's cozy, authentic, and the jazz music they play is amazeballs.  Wish it weren't so expensive, otherwise I'd be here every day.  People who live near this place have it good."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favourite non AYCE sushi location!  Their sushi and sashimi are so fresh you can enjoy bold taste of fish.  The Spicy Salmon sushi with chunky salmon pieces are to die for!  Also the dynamite rolls are huge and tasty.  

The price might sound pricey but worth paying for quality fresh food.  Service has been improved and make sure to make reservation in the weekend cause it does get very busy!!"}
{"text":"This place is PRICY. The sushi portions are larger than average but prices are also much higher than average. Still, the sushi is AMAZING. Seriously the fish just feel like butter. Delicious. Try the specialty rolls!"}
{"text":"Been a regular for the past 14+ years and I always order the same thing and always change the order to all salmon (because I don't like the other fish as much). Apparently there was a recent change and I was charged an extra $2 for this change. Salmon is one of the cheaper fish out there (compared to tuna). So I switched the tuna for cheaper fish and get charged an extra $2. And this is not reflected anywhere on the menu. What a way to treat a 14-year regular customer that have spent thousands (literally) dining at your restaurant.

I will be hesitant to go there again now..."}
{"text":"Rly cute and hidden sushi restaurant in Mississauga. They close between 3-5 or something along those lines so make sure you don't end up in the restaurant during those times. My friend and I came a little late once and were politely reminded that they would be closing soon.

Sushi pieces are small , but can definitely taste the freshness and quality. The lunch bento boxes are great. Haven't tried anything but bento boxes yet so I'll update when that happens. They give you some hot cinnamon gingery type tea when you're done the meal and it helps end things off nicely. The place does get quite crowded during lunch rush since it's a small place"}
{"text":"Sushi is very flavourful and tastes fresh. Although the prices seem higher than average, the portions are quite large. Service isn't terrible, most sushi restaurants I've been to have subpar service. In terms of quality, this might be the best sushi restaurant in Mississauga."}
{"text":"I was looking for sushi places I could do take-out from. Because of the amazing reviews this place got on Yelp I decided to give it a try. Even though yelp says the price range is reasonable I thought it was expensive considering the quantity I received. Despite that I decided to give this place a try again and I did so today by dining in. The service was terrible. They did not ask us for drinks until after we had ordered. I love sushi and know few of my favorites. I tried to go out of my comfort zone and try something new. We specifically mentioned that we don't like anything raw. In spite of mentioning that our server did not inform me that the lunch special I had ordered had raw sushi in it. I was in dismay when my food was brought and even after expressing my concern they did not do anything about it. I decided to let it go. The other two familiar dishes my family had ordered were well presented but lacked favour and were over-priced. It is better to eat all-you-can eat considering how expensive this place is. Do not waste your time. Part of the dining experience is the atmosphere and service. The atmosphere is cozy and warm but the service terrible. And the food does not even make you feel better. I usually never write negative reviews but this was extremely disappointing. I am  never going back here and never recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Great Sushi! The staff is over-worked though. The waitresses always seem hassled and are very unfriendly. I'd go there again...for the great sushi. Their spider roll and unagi is to die for!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a strip plaza in the middle of suburbia between a florist and dry cleaners is this gem!

About 4 years ago, I was introduced to Hinote by a friend who had recently traveled to Japan. She says this was the one of the few restaurants in the GTA where she trust to find high quality Japanese food... and she's right! (Since my introduction to Hinote, I've also been to Japan - and I do still think it's one of the best restos for Japanese cuisine in GTA.)

It is a bit pricier, but the quality can't be beat compared to other local restos! I've brought many friends here and they agree! 

The sashimi is very fresh and literally, melts in your mouth. The rolls comes in pretty large portions. and are presented in an appealing fashion. My favourites rolls: are rainbow, spicy salmon, and spider. Their noodle dishes are very good too.

It's a really small dining room - so make reservations as around dinner time it's packed.

It's a nice intimate space for family dinners, or dates.

Be warned though: service is slow... but the food is worth the wait. So leave extra time around the meal if you're planning other activities around it."}
{"text":"Good is fine. Premise is small. Quite noisy. If u like Japanese food but don't need the Zen ambiance this one will do."}
{"text":"Rating: 4.5

This is probably now my absolute favourite place for sushi in Mississauga. I came here with a friend for lunch around 12:45pm. It is small but very quaint. There were only a few tables that were occupied. A waitress seated us and gave us menus as she was getting our drink orders.

I ordered the box #3 combo ($15.95) which had sashimi and sushi. When I turned to my friend to say something, the waitress already came back with miso soups and our drinks. Wow, such fast service!

I was so happy when my sushi arrived. It was so tasty. The California maki roll had thick avocado slices. It came with two tuna, two salmon, one butterfish, and one slightly grilled salmon sushi. So tasty!

When we got our bills, the waitress gave us a cute little cup of some sort of cinnamon tea. It was so delicious. My friend tells me it's a blend of a Japanese tea and a Korean tea. Absolutely the perfect ending to our lunch.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I came here based on a friend's comment that Hinote has apparently \"The BEST sushi EVER. Hands down.\"

Not to offend her or anything... Now I can definitely say it's not the BEST sushi EVER (it didn't wow me), it was still pretty good. (Unfortunately VERY pricey for \"pretty good\" food)

This is a small little restaurant with bamboo-like furniture and decorations, nothing at all what you'd expect from its outdoor neon sign.

Sushi orders are quite expensive here so we didn't order much sushi or sashimi. 

Wakame (seaweed) Salad $4.95: the seaweed isn't like what you'd have at AYCE sushi or at T&T. It's actual seaweed seaweed and they look like rose vines (without the rose). It's very very fresh -love!

Unagi Don $14.95 BBQ eel with special sauce over rice: FAVOURITE. I don't usually like eels and sweet sauce in other Japanese restaurants, but this one was exceptionally amazing. The sauce is sweet mostly, which is usually how unagi don is, but this is PERFECT sweet. Plus Japanese sushi rice, it's honestly so amazing. I loved it so much that I shooed our waitress away whenever she tried to take our unfinished plate (I wanted to clear this plate completely). -love!

Anyways, I'm not impressed by any of their sushi dishes: assorted, combo dinner, and the sushi rolls. It's very general sushi and nothing crazy interesting. Most of these assorted sushi are California rolls and salmon. Meh.
But we did eye other tables -their sushi and sashimi comes on a very pretty boat! I love boat dishes! 

We did order a side dish of fried squid (Ika Yaki $9.95) and seared salmon sushi. The sushi was good but nothing amazing. The fried squid (I love squid) oh my gosh, the entire squid is on the plate -pointed head, body, tentacles, everything. And they put the squid together (like a finished puzzle) and it's pretty cute. Love the sauce on the squid too!

Conclusion: Sushi is expensive but it's just ordinary sushi. It's good but nothing crazy impressive. Love the unagi don and their sweet sauce. 4 stars because I've had better."}
{"text":"Very fresh fish , probably Best in north America. I have tried sushi in cali & florida & somehow hinote still have the freshest fish. The avocado salad is great. The sear salmon is a must try! They serve complimentary cinnamon  tea at end of meal which delicious. Sashimi tray is great value. Very small shop, maybe 12 tables max . Oo aheads up they close on sunday."}
