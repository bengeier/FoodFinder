{"text":"Great food but oh my god it's spelled LETTUCE! LETTUCE! Not \"lettus\"! Every single day - EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. the specials sign is so badly written it nearly gives me heart failure. I know that's not the most important thing here, but it really gives me pause. If you know for a fact that spelling and/or grammar is not your strong suit, just google. For the love of god, just GOOGLE."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is homey, everyone's kind, even the other customers. Coffee flows faster than you can finish your cup and comes in three flavors, all delicious. The breakfast menu is a plethora of tempting dishes. The semi open kitchen is sparkling clean. And the food. The breakfast tacos & the absurdly big crepe omelet. These amazing people have placed bacon and spinach over an egg and wrapped it a with a taco. I wish I could have more than four."}
{"text":"I was in Mesa on business and a friend suggested we grab lunch; I really don't know much about Mesa restaurants so I did what we all do . . .\"hey Google\".  Anyway, we stopped in on a whim.  Boy am I glad we discovered this place.  It's in the Mesa City Plaza building so it's a bit challenging to find if you've never been there.  Google maps says \"you're there\" when you're on Main Street, but it's actually just a bit north, on the other side of the building.  Anyway, this place is decorated very eclectically.  Like Walt Disney on LSD was their decorator - I actually liked it because it wasn't stuffy.  It's CLEARLY not a chain restaurant.  I sat down outside on the little patio.  Lana was our server and she was the perfect balance of attentiveness but not overbearing.  I ordered the Hashknife burger.  Full disclosure - I'm a burger snob to the 10th power.  This hamburger was one of the best I've had in a long time.  Big, juicy and cooked just like I asked.  It was seasoned well too.  They're only open Monday through Thursday for breakfast and lunch, but I HIGHLY suggest making the trek (in my case; maybe you're closer)."}
{"text":"This is a great place with Friendly service. They are open early and usually have some budget friendly specials. It's a gem hidden in downtown Mesa. I just love this place."}
{"text":"If you're looking for family friendly kitsch, this is the place for you. The food was competent, but the vibe was a little creepy. Waitress had her daughter there who spoke incessantly to her Mother in the kitchen. That combined with Dora the explorer on the TV was pretty hard to take. I might possibly return, but only for take out."}
{"text":"This place is stellar! At the bottom floor of the Mesa City Plaza building,they serve up great breakfast burritos, killer sandwiches and more, and always with a smile. The employees & owners are extremely friendly, and they clearly care about their customers.  I have been here nearly a dozen times and have yet to have something I didn't love! Their daily specials are always tasty, and all of their grilled cheese combinations are delicious.  This is a great breakfast & lunch spot that will remind you of food \"the way mom always made it.\""}
{"text":"This was a cute, family place. The food was pretty good, didn't blow my mind away but it satisfied my hanger. The service was excellent, very friendly."}
{"text":"I called ahead of time to ask about gluten free options.  The chef, who answered surprisingly, told me that she is very happy to accommodate and explained that she uses different pans and utensils.  I arrived with a friend, we sat inside.  It is cute, quiet, and casual.  She ordered the turkey, cranberry sandwich.  I had the Reuben special as a salad rather than sandwich, at the waitresses suggestion.  It sounded weird but it was delicious!  Prices were fair.  I love finding local spots to support and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Egg salad sandwich and potato salad were great. Grilled cheese sandwich was delicious. We liked that they are willing to add or take away from the sandwiches (ie you add turkey or ham, etcetera to the grilled cheese). Also Love the decor."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough great things about this place. The staff is incredibly friendly and beyond helpful. They will literally make you *anything*, even if it's not on the menu.    The special of the day was green chile pork.  I wanted to avoid the carbs of a burrito or nachos, so they made me a custom taco salad with green chile pork on top. *Amazing*.    My husband had the Overdone Grilled Cheese - best grilled cheese I think I've ever had.   And while we were eating, we overheard one of the waitresses suggest to a customer to get the Overdone Grilled Cheese WITH THE GREEN CHILE PORK ON TOP. I almost fell out of my chair. If I hadn't been 2/3 of the way through my salad, I would have ditched my diet and slipped into a carb coma.   And did I mention that they have Date Shakes?  Who needs to drive to Blythe?!    That's it. We're sold. This is our new \"place\"."}
{"text":"I've never been to a restaurant that was so consistently fantastic as this place is. The food is always great, the ranch is the best I've ever had, and the service is so friendly you feel like Norm from Cheers."}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend, and I looked on yelp to find a good breakfast place. It turns out the downtown rendezvous is a wonderful surprise. It's a cozy little place, that has amazingly delicious food at an inexpensive price. I ordered the ham steak and eggs, and the ham was cooked perfectly, the eggs beautifully sunny side up, and the toast wasn't burnt!:-). I would gladly come back again, to try some of their other foods, because their prices are very inexpensive, the staff was very helpful, and all the food around me you looked great."}
{"text":"Delightful hidden gem! Sister and I found on yelp when looking for a good breakfast in downtown Mesa, and we sure got it here!   She had the scramble and I had the huevos rancheros - why not? We both devoured our meals!   Also enjoyed great coffee and a freshly baked cookie - who can resist cookies baking?!  All the staff were delightful and seemed to really enjoy their customers! We'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place is not fancy- but it is clean, the people working here are so friendly, and the food is excellent! We stopped by for breakfast and were blown away by the great food at such cheap prices."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast with my Aunt while I was visiting Arizona last Monday & we were pleasantly surprised with our experience! Our server was very sweet, knowledgeable & attentive! (I wish I remembered her name ) our drinks were never empty, she accommodated smoothly with my vegan needs, AND our food was very yummie! I ordered a hummus everything bagel with avocado & tomato- soooo delicious. I recommended this place to my friends who live in the area"}
{"text":"A very warm, friendly and welcoming place. It made me feel good to have come here and support this family owned and operated business. I believe that you'll feel the same way if you haven't had an opportunity to eat here. Good food and good people -  a winning combination!"}
{"text":"Great small family own joint that provides awesome food services! Burgers and sandwich are filling and delicious and their sweet turnovers are must! Highly recommend if you like the home style family authentic comfort breakfast / lunch food!"}
{"text":"Not your typical chain restaurant, but that's the beauty of it. Breakfast and lunch with home-made deliciousness! The entrance is on the NORTH side of the large City of Mesa building (off of Pepper Street). Everything on the menu hits the spot and even if you are craving something else - just ask and they will make it for you."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. I had the bacon jalape√±o hamburger with a mustard macaroni side. It was delicious. The establishment is small and its best to be there around 1 after the lunch crowd unless you want breakfast. I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because I ate outside on the patio and personally thought it could've been made to look nicer."}
{"text":"Had a great French toast breakfast here. The staff is super friendly and helpful. Seems like the get a lot of regulars here. Even though I was visiting from out of town, I felt like I was one of the regulars. Great place."}
{"text":"Love my Downtown Rendezvous!  Great mom and pop feel with exceptional quality.  I am more demanding than most restaurant goers however Brittney always accommodates and makes us off the menu items just like I like them.  I have tried a wide variety of items from the menu and I love all of them.  Highly recommend going you wont be disappointed.  Heads up not open on Fridays :(  Not your fault i blame the city of Mesa, they do a lot of disappointing things"}
{"text":"Nice little breakfast / lunch spot in downtown mesa.  It was a little weird to find because it has an address with the city building.  If you get there before 7, the city doors are locked.  It is just east of those doors.    My BELT sandwich was just as advertised.   Perfect meal before playing golf."}
{"text":"Updated to note that the business is now open pretty reliably on Fridays. Craving a coffee and breakfast burrito now...."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this when looking for a place to grab a quick bite with a coworker. Was pleasantly surprised by this place. Their chicken salad was delicious and it was more than enough- same with their Mac salad. My coworker got the BLT on sourdough and was amazed at how much bacon was actually in it. Definitely a great find."}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch.  It is a great place to get in and out of within an hour.  The food is fantastic.  They have a big variety of sandwiches and sides.  The staff is friendly, and seem to always remember their regulars.  They have both a great indoor and outdoor space.  I will definitely be going here regularly."}
{"text":"This is a great little spot for Breakfast, I just happen to find this place by being disappointed by one that was highly recommended, one of the first times that I welcomed disappointment.  I am so glad that this was my consolation prize....This establishment is a true home like winner."}
{"text":"I ate breakfast here this morning and was delighted with the whole experience!  I had a BLT on whole wheat bread with avocado and it was delicious.  My friend had an omelet and remarked at how especially tasty the cottage fries and bacon were.  The waitress was friendly and very thorough with our orders.  We even got to talk briefly with the cook!  I am definitely going to go there again soon.  (Note:  they are currently open Monday thru Thursday)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Service was great. I had coffee and bacon burrito. Delicious! Prices were affordable too. Will come back soon"}
{"text":"Met a buddy hear for lunch and loved the place.  It's only open for breakfast and lunch and the food is OUTSTANDING. I liked the butternut squash soup so much I had a 2nd bowl along with my Burger.  mmmmmmmm goooooood!!!!!"}
{"text":"To be fair I will return to try the breakfast based on the way this situation was handled. We went today for lunch, I ordered the Bacon Burger and my gal ordered the chicken and cranberry sandwich. The burger was a total disaster, the meat was bad and left a bad staying taste in my mouth. My friends sandwich wasn't bad, but it was pretty bland lacking flavor. They raved about their potato salad only to tell us they had none. Out of it at 11 am? Somebody dropped the ball the day or night before.  The side dish of Black Eyed Peas were quite tasty. Very tasty.  The reason I will return and give them another chance is the way the young lady handled my complaint. She didn't argue with me and I wasn't rude at all but she handled it like a total pro. Sometimes stuff happens that surprises you. But the reaction to the customer makes the difference between a total boycott or a return for a chance for a better experience.   It has a nice outdoor dining area and some cool antiques for sale inside.  Because of her I will try it again."}
{"text":"I went here when my dad came to town from out of state it was a place I never been. Location a bit of a thought process to find sense it's in a business. But I still give it five stars service was great atmosphere was homey and food was delicious. Def coming back"}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the best restaurant in downtown Mesa.  They are located just north of Main st on Center in a City of Mesa office building.  The ladies that run it are the best!! The food is unbeatable.  Their menu is to die for.  I just had the Jalape√±o Popper Burger - one of the best burgers I have ever had.  I highly recommend the macaroni salad as a side.  If you have not been to Rendezvous you need to try it. This is by far the best place for lunch in Mesa."}
{"text":"This place was hard to find but its really close to main street located downtown. Staff is super friendly and family oriented. Location is old school and not too hectic. Prices were good food was decent. I will come again with hubby for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"The food definitely lived to the hype of feeling and tasting fresh. I had the turkey pesto on naan bread. I expected there to be pesto sauce (oil and basil) in it but it turned out to be a bit of pesto mixed with some kind of mayo/ranch sauce. It was only a drizzle which left me trying to find the flavor in the sandwich. The sandwich was a good size, plenty of deli cut turkey. The side salad was just lettuce with a few spinach leaves thrown in, a couple of grape tomatoes, and a few slices of cucumber. I wasn't blown away, but I would go back if I'm ever in search of a simple meal with freshness in mind."}
{"text":"No one there, 2 of us went for breakfast.  We waited for water and coffee.  Took close to 45' to get our food, because City employees had an order. Food was very good, but the wait was uncalled for."}
{"text":"Has the best burgers, best breakfast, and best soup in the downtown Mesa area, if not the entire Mesa area.  Somebody knows how to cook!  :)  Don't see much point in going anywhere else for such things.  Only downside is that it's closed Friday, Saturday, and Sunday."}
{"text":"Between the out door and rear seating there are 15 tables, that I counted. It felt much smaller. We were the only ones in the place, and it took a while for the food to come out. I enjoyed my surroundings. I would come back if I was in the area.   My wife got a French toast and I got a bacon egg and cheese on a bagel. Serving sizes were kind of small. It was still tasty."}
{"text":"Nothing but good things to say. I would definitely come back. I work for Wells Fargo nearby and they deliver and have great customer service. Very accommodating for business professionals."}
{"text":"I found this amazing breakfast restaurant through Yelp, and it did not disappoint. Not only is the waitress incredibly friendly but the food is fresh and delicious. This has become our weekly indulgence and the waitress now remembers what we order. The vegetable egg scramble with a side of cottage cheese has a variety of fresh vegetables like corn, onion, broccoli!, you name it, it's there! And best of all, each week they have different fresh vegetables so it's always some new and amazing scramble egg concoction. I've never eaten here for lunch but assume it's just as tasty! Give this restaurant a try, you won't be disappointed.   FYI: they are not open Friday through Sunday :("}
