{"text":"Decent for $1 pizza night. Greek salad is really good. My son enjoys going here also."}
{"text":"Girl looked at me weird when I asked for Sicilian slice and I had to say square. They no have which is disappointing.  Plain cheese slice is good."}
{"text":"I visited Carmella's after a recommendation from some friends. Apparently Tuesday nights is $1 Pizza and $1 Beer night. For $1 I figured why not try it out. We walked in and found a seat. Our server came and took our order. About 10 minutes later our slices came out. They were hot, delicious large slices of \"NY\" Pizza. It had a great flavor and delicious crust. Our server was very nice. The restaurant has several large screen TVs to keep you entertained while you wait. For $1 pizza I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Ok so carmellas is a love hate type of restaurant. The quality of food isn't the best but not bad for the price. I used to hate this place but I go for dollar slice night almost every Tuesday and the staff is awesome! They take great care of my group of friends. They know our drinks and type of pizza we like before we even sit down. Love that quality of service, unfortunately not everyone will be going once a week to this location so it's a biased review but I must say I enjoy being taken care of."}
{"text":"Pizza was in a bar style pizza heater. Strike 1. Strike 2 the pizza sauce tasted like a can of paste. Strike 3 was the meatball parm hero I ordered which had what look liked plastic for parmigiana cheese which means it's cheap cheese and the meat balls were over cooked and probably microwaved in the back. Only good thing was the bread which they toasted. Not sure I'll go back again but everyone has bad days right."}
{"text":"Good food in a laid back atmosphere. If you're feeling lucky play some Keno. Also great pizza and beer specials on Tuesday's."}
{"text":"Ive been here 3 times within the past two weeks the pizza is awesome, I usually have a slice or two. And ive put my boyfriend on to them too. They are conveniently located not far from my home, or job."}
{"text":"Been years since I have been here and thank goodness.  The staff was aloof and could care less to take an order or answer a question.  The pizza slice was dry and tasted like it was from last week, $2.50 down the drain.  Got a salad it wasn't bad, wasn't good either but I was hungry so I ate.  Also ordered wings to go when I placed my order and after waiting for 15 minutes after eating my lunch I went up front and my wings were just sitting there with no intention of them bringing them to me.  So there some more time I won't get back.  Wings were bland and I asked for hot and the blue cheese was the consistency of milk, not good to say the least.

I hate giving bad reviews but hopefully they can learn and improve. Best of luck and I won't be going back"}
{"text":"Advertised \"New York Style\" pizza, and had us wondering if they had ever been to New York. Pizza was medium crust, cheese was low quality with grease puddling on top, and the sauce wasn't even noticeable. Waitress wasn't nasty, but definitely had a very strange attitude and came off as fake nice. I was scared of her."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and I recommend it to anyone omg their wings are delicious and that lasagna is heavenly I work close by so I rend to eat her a couple of times a week and I've turned all my coworkers on to those place its fast and they are always friendly ."}
{"text":"Great pizza!! And I'm from NYC I should know! Very nice employees! Smells so good! I really loved the pizza slices I ordered and the employees were very nice as well. I can't wait to eat here again soon. I only wished they delivered further than 2 miles away!"}
{"text":"I was Craving pizza and this place definitely satisfied that.  1st pizza place I've had since I moved from up North. So far so good."}
{"text":"We ordered a large pizza and cannoli. The pizza was really big and way more than enough for the two of us and I thought it tasted really good. The cannoli was really good as well. The customer service that we received was excellent and delivery was pretty quick. I would definitely order again."}
{"text":"Had 2 pasta dinners that were not only delicious but huge portion. Will be ordering delivery many more times in the future."}
{"text":"I should preface this by saying I did not have pizza,  so my bad. 
However,  I thought the canzone looked pretty good.   Unfortunately, the best part of it was the bread.   Perhaps the worst canzone I've ever had.    
Also,  they were understaffed the night I was there so the service was not good."}
{"text":"After looking at the reviews I will be ordering... But my only question..... How The wings ?? I haven't had anything from here but when I called the customer service was great! 5STARS"}
{"text":"That SPO (sausage, peppers, and onions) pizza is bomb! (And I mean that in a good way) The sausage is so flavorful. 

I've also had the Philly cheesesteak and the super Italian combo which I wasn't impressed with. They both lacked flavor. 

They have good lunch specials that run from 10:30-4pm and a full bar."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the pizza here. I really dislike when places claim their pizza is of a certain style and it doesn't live up to my expectations."}
{"text":"I'm not super crazy about their pizza it's ok but it's soggy. Basically they should try to bake a lot ll longer to keep the slice in tac. Wings are super awesome and I like to go there on night n it's chill bar Inside. But it is my local"}
{"text":"I was curious about the Philly since there is a sign that said best in town. Mayo on a Philly sounds weird, so I asked them not to any on. My Philly was made to order, the food was hot and came out pretty fast. The cheese tasted weird, there was hardly any neat and there was an awful lot of grease. I am not sure I am willing to try it again, bit I would definitely not call this one the best."}
{"text":"Tried it for the 1st time tonight. Definitely going back. Our server's name was Jenna and she was awesome and knowledgeable re: the menu. Ordered a 14\" pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms, and italian sausage. It was fantastic! Thin crust, not too salty and heavy on the toppings. Also ordered 10 wings (only $7.25!) naked, fried crispy and dredged in Sweet Thai Chili. Great crispy wings. Had to try the cherry peppers stuffed with cheese and prosciutto. Spicy, chewy, slightly salty and delicious.Finger lickin' good. Well drinks, 5 bucks, bottled domestics, $2.50. This is going to be one of my new Friday or Saturday night go-tos!"}
{"text":"This spot used to be my go-to for lunch since the food WAS always delicious and priced well. The last three times I've gone, I've had to wait over an hour for a sandwich or received cold food when I pick up my to-go order. I really hope that they can hire more folks and get their kitchen in line since I know most of us can't take an hour lunch for a small sub and fries. I'm taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"They have good food, I love their pizza and wings. The only reason I give 4 stars is because they only deliver after 5pm which is not specified anywhere, all it says is \"we deliver\""}
{"text":"I live near by, and use to do take out from here all the time, until they started being rude to me on the phone, and sometimes not answering the phone at all, and when I saw the review with the band cooked into the pizza, that was enough for me to never eat here again."}
{"text":"So I had to share my experience about this place. The place is called Carmella's Pizza Grill in Charlotte, NC located on South Tryon Street. I Came here for lunch today like I normally do as a frequent customer and ordered a Philly cheesesteak... I noticed one of the Hispanic females in the back making other people's food with her bare hands and not stopping to wash them not one time. She then proceeded to grab the raw steak meat for my sandwich with no gloves on her hands and place it on the grill then grabbed my bread with her hands and sliced it... I was absolutely disgusted as she put my pickle in the box... Loaded my sandwich with cheese and all and not once washing her hands or putting on gloves! Very unsanitary!!! I told them I didn't want the sandwich and another person decided made me a new sandwich with gloves!!! I will not be going back to this place... I cannot believe they touch people's food with no gloves and when the cashier told the lady to put on gloves she argued with her and got an attitude and still didn't put on gloves and proceeded to touch other people's food!!! As well I never got an apology!!! Very rude and disgusting experience!!!"}
{"text":"Had to run to the Publix to get a birthday cupcake for my coworker and needed to grab lunch quick. There was a pretty big line but the staff was working very hard so I decided to stay to order. I got the meatball sub with waffle fries. I had to wait to eat most of it after work since it took too long to get it during lunch but it was absolutely delicous after nuking it. I saw the wings coming out of the kitchen and I can't wait to be able to go back to try them maybe after work to eat it hot and fresh from the kitchen with a beer. Pizza looked great too!!!"}
{"text":"No sanitation score is posted, food is DISGUSTING, service is sketchy at best and bathroom was appalling. The tip jar at the register goes to the house, not the servers! Different servers every few weeks, I wouldn't want to work there either for pennies on the dollar, I'm sure there's something illegal going on!"}
{"text":"It's like Cheers where everyone knows your name!! Karaoke on Fridays!!! Nice dive bar, full bar with daily drink specials, lunch specials, good pizza, wings and other bar food! That have a juke box, and outdoor seating over looking the parking area. 

I've visited here for speciality pizza that I can't find at other local pizza spots."}
{"text":"Prefacing the fact there is snowy weather and we are from out of town, we went here because it was close to walmart. We go in with very very few tables occupied and we sit down at two dirty tables for our group of six. The bar tender comes over and takes our drink and appetizers order and it comes out fairly quickly and was good at which time they took the dirty pizza pan from one of our tables but never wiped either of them.  We place our entree order and after 45 minutes and watching numerous to go orders and other customers receiving their food I went to the bar tender who looked into our order and said it was never printed and given to the cook staff. We never got any beverage refills even though the bar tender walked by us several times. But on a good note the table behind us who were regulars evidently by the way the bar tender and them talked to one another, their pizza smelled great."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, we'll be back. Atmosphere is... Interesting. But they put their efforts into the food. Yum. Recommend the cheese garlic bread"}
{"text":"I personally thought the pizza & cheese sticks were great. (This is the only reason I am giving 4 stars).  This was our 1st time visiting this restaurant. My only complaint is service is a little slow.  Our waitress was friendly and all.....but then to have another customer at the restaurant come up to us and tell us that she was at the bar saying we were probably going to \"stiff\" her pissed me off!  Why she thought that is beyond me, but we left her a tip over 20% and I left her a little note on the receipt that we knew what she said.  Needless to say we probably will not return because she turned a nice evening of pizza with our 2 year old daughter into a not nice ending!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on the way to the vet hospital.  We ordered a couple pepperoni slices and wings.  The pizza was ok, a little greasy.  Wings were dry.  You can definitely tell this is a hang out for neighborhood folks, which was kinda cute."}
{"text":"Dined in once before..service was slow, but it was a Suday and the food was good.
Tonight I called in a stromboli to go.. Got there 5 min. later to have a beer and wait. 40 minutes later I get my food (their POS system is ancient so they had to count the drawer to close it out, then the next server had to come right back and RE count the drawer).. me and 2 other customers were waiting...just to pay...30 minutes. WHAT THE FUCK???
The shittiest part was I called in a pepperoni and ground beef stromboli..got home and it was some bullshit onions and fucking Ham. This place sucks. Not going back...will help my friends make the decision to not go there either. Oh well. Maybe a efficient pizza joint will open when they close soon."}
{"text":"Hello friends,

Stopped by here for a quick drink (cousins birthday) before shopping at BiLo. 

It's the old Bellacino's Grinders. They changed the inside a bit. Kinda weird tho. About 10-15 (4 seat) tables to the right. 1 long booth that has 2 tables to them. The bar.... Well that's kinda cray. It's one 5 seat bar in front. You get to the second bar by going into what one may consider the kitchen. We saw a few ppl sitting there. At 1st we thought they were employees because of the location of the bar. 

Very nice servers. I think they were the owners. (Maybe sisters. Idk) we didn't order any food but noticed a guy in the Val Hand Tossing pizza dough. And a family dressed in church clothes eating. And a few young ppl in there munching it up. 

Pretty good lunch specials and drink specials. 

They deliver & open til 2."}
{"text":"Fries undercooked. Hair in fries. Gyro ok meat, toppings. Nothing great. Luckily I got it to go - or they would take it back."}
{"text":"Just tried this place with a close friend of mine.  It was a great experience and not expensive at all. The beers and pizza are A great combination.  It is my new favorite place to hang out at for late night fun times. Come check them out and bring a friend."}
{"text":"I've eaten here on several occasions and the food is just ok. It's never consistently good and very greasy. The wings are good but sometimes too wet and not crispy enough, the pizza is meh and the spaghetti and Strombolli were NOT good. If you are looking for a cheap and quick bite this should be your last resort in terms of tasty and fulfilling."}
{"text":"We were heading to trivia when the boyfriend remembered Carmella's has a wing special on Wednesdays... Well, it's basically .50 a wing, so it's not that special, but it's decent... 

When you go to Carmella's, you walk in and the cash register is directly in front of you... You order and pay for your food and then you can seat yourself where you like... I went in, ordered 10 wings and 2 beers, paid and went to grab a seat... After about 10 minutes, I went back to the register because our beers still hadn't come out yet... Apparently, the bartender opened them and just left them sitting on the counter instead of bringing them out to us... Okay... After another 30 minutes with no wings, we ended up having to leave because we were on our way to another place... I went back up to the register to get a refund for the wings because we clearly were not going to have time to eat them... None of the employees knew how to do a refund to a credit card... They finally find the guy that knows how to do the refunds, so it gets started... After a couple minutes, I offered to just take cash back because it was my debit card, but they just acted like they didn't hear me... Maybe they didn't... Not only that, when I asked for the refund, no one asked why or even apologized for their shoddy service... They basically acted like I wasn't really standing there until she had me sign the receipt for the refund...  They refunded the money for the beers, too, but I don't think that was an attempt to be courteous, I think they probably couldn't figure it out and didn't care enough to try... That's it... I'm over Carmella's... At least this location..."}
{"text":"Stopped here after a volleyball tournament with three hungry girls and we weren't disappointed. We had wings- really liked the Thai chili was so tasty- the Caesar and house salad both were good and a large pizza which was excellent. Service was reasonable and the staff was very friendly. The only real problem was that all the food came out at the same time even though I ordered the wings as an appetizer. By the time we ate the wings and salads and tackled the pizza part of it was a little soggy. I would also strongly recommend they invest in some spatulas to serve the 18\" pizzas. It would just be much easier to serve than using the small plastic knife. We'd go back again. I'd just make sure to order the pizza after the wings came out."}
{"text":"If you're looking for decent food for a decent price, this is your place. Their menu is huge. They have everything from pizza and pasta to heros and pitas. I've had several dishes on the menu and I haven't been overly impressed with any of them. This time I got a chicken pita and it wasn't bad. I've tried their Mediterranean pasta before which is ok but very greasy. My favorite thing that the serve is the seasoned waffle fries. 

Last time I was there we had particularly bad service as well. We ended up refilling our drinks ourselves because the waiter never came back."}
{"text":"Man this pizza taste just like the pizza at SAMS Club been sitting awhile and chewy. Glad I only got one slice."}
{"text":"For pizza, I'm going to be at Luigi's but today I tried someplace different. Carmella's for a meatball parmesan sub with waffle fries.

The fries were limp. The bread had a texture that suggested a microwave rather than a toaster. The cheese was nicely melted, the sauce was bland and the meatballs were tasty but a little rubbery. Sorry, guys.

A couple of big screen TV's tuned into sports channels plus a couple of video game machines to keep the kids entertained."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a long day at work.  Was happy to see that they were still serving food until 2.  Enjoyed a few miller lite bottles for $1.50!  Ordered 2 kinds of wings bbq and honey mustard, 10 each for 5 bucks an order.  What a great deal and the sauces were out of this world.  Everything was house made.  Also ordered an antipasto salad that was the bomb.  Prices were all very reasonable.  Love the vibe of the place, loved the food, loved the prices, and they are open till 2!!  What more do you need.  Excited to try their pizza next time!"}
{"text":"Mondays $0.50 wings
Tuesdays $1.00 cheese or pepperoni pizza slices

Cheap drinks

If this place was closer to where I lived, I would definitely go there more often. The pizza and wings are very tasty and priced excellent. Will def be going back soon!"}
{"text":"When my colleagues said this place has good cheese steaks, my ears perked and decided to check them out.  

I haven't been in this space since it was Bellacino's which closed a while ago.  Carmella's certainly makes use of the space.  They kept some of Bellacino's tables but also added bar tables, booth seating and also a small bar where half of the kitchen used to be.

The menu is quite broad with sandwiches, pizza and Italian items.  But I was here for one reason, the Philly.  Theirs comes with specific items so if you don't want some items on it, you have to tell them so.  Who puts mayo on a cheesesteak?  yuck.  Anyway, opted for marinara sauce instead of mayo.  That's how I grew up with Phillys.   It also comes with your choice of fries, chips or slaw.  I went with fries.

The best thing about this sandwich is the bread.  I haven't tasted such good bread on a Philly since I moved south.  The meat was good but there seemed to be a shortage of it and it was smothered in so much cheese that it was hard to find the meat, sauce, onions and peppers. I didn't really care for the sauce.  It was too sweet but all the flavors together were decent and it created a soggy mess of the bread which is actually something I love in a Philly and something that is very hard to find.

Despite the flaws and because finding a decent cheese steak is so hard to find in the south, I'd still rank this one in my Top 5 in Charlotte.  The fries were decent too and the people were really friendly in here.  It might be worth another visit to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"So unhappy with how our order was handled.  We ordered takeout and did not receive what we ordered. I called to make them aware, the girl answering the phone was very defensive.  In the midst of her answering the call, she said 3 different places and was laughing finally stated Carmella's. I kindly let her know our order was incorrect, she started yelling over me and wouldn't let me finish. I did my want a refund nor them bring other food out, just wanted to make them aware that order was incorrect in case someone else's order was the same. I finally decided to end conversation as she was so rude. Very disappointed in our food as well as how this was handled. She refused for me to speak with manager. We used to order something every week, we stopped about 3 months ago due to quality of good, decided to give another chance. This was the LAST chance. I hope they can get it together, it's a shame how it's being run into the ground and no one cares."}
