{"text":"Don't order shrimp tempura  in all you can eat . Under staff during lunch time other wise  the rest is average"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat sushi !!! This place has the most options out of any other place I know. Plus you can get more than one mochi ice cream! Crazy I know. And the service is amazing ! All the servers are so nice and smiley ! Love it and would recommend it to everyone ! And they have a happy hour BOGO after 9pm !!! Just perfect for an alcoholic for me ;) !!! Just kidding.. Kinda."}
{"text":"The service was great. The servers were quick, knowledgeable and friendly. The food was amazing, the best sushi I have had. We got the all you can eat and it was definitely worth the money. Plus it is close to our house. We will be coming back and recommended in this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"First time here will sure come back soon for their deep fried sushi , we had years looking for places with deep fried sushi and finally found the perfect one"}
{"text":"This AYCE really worth trying.  The fatty tuna belly is just like butter.  Very friendly staff as always"}
{"text":"I've been desperately looking for a good \"go-to\" sushi restaurant when I'm in the mood for a piece of fish and a roll.  So far I've felt like Vegas has let me down in that department. I'm pleased to announce I have found that \"go-to\" sushi restaurant.

I would have to say that the yellowtail jalapeno platter rivals that of Nobu for $10 less and way more fish.  Their nigiri is amazing, and their rolls have hit spot on.  Not too many sauces (like those restaurants up and down Eastern...not naming names), and they don't have rolls that are called \"tastes like my ex-wife (or maybe girlfriend)\" which always leave me with a bad taste in my mouth (haha...puns are funny).  The Kiss of Fire roll is my fav.

Staff is attentive, chef's are friendly, and the atmosphere is modern and clean."}
{"text":"I have been going here for sushi for a couple years now. The services used to be amazing, and it is slowly and steadily declining. However, their food is still fantastic! This is some of the best fish I've been able to taste without going to a casino or China Town. For all you can eat sushi, the price isn't really that bad either. The restaurant is in a really good part of town and is kept clean and nice. It's one of my favorite places to go for sushi in Las Vegas, so if you're in the northwestern part of town, I would definitely say go! I recommend the Monkey Brains!"}
{"text":"I am not sure what happened to this place, but the music is blasting, the service is terrible and what a shame, because this was a nice place ."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Had a good time with my friends. The staff members are all friendly and helpful. thank you Kaizen"}
{"text":"We did the all you can eat lunch menu and enjoyed it very much! Baked Salmon Roll is now one of my favorites. We sat at the bar, right in front of the chefs and were able to place an immediate order, with very little wait time. They give you 1 1/2 hours for the AYCE. Certain items were on the dinner menu only; that's understandable. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I won't take away the fact that the food here is good. However, the service is terrible. Myself and 2 friends came to celebrate a birthday and were seated right away but waited more than 40 minutes for 2 waters and a coke. The waitress took our order and brought out our sushi and we ate with no drinks. When we reminded her of our drinks, she told us they had no cups at the moment while there were 5 dirty tables with several cups each. We then waited another 20 minutes with no sushi, no drinks, and no waitress to take our order. Needless to say, we walked out and won't be back."}
{"text":"Food is good and a server name Ann is very friendly and make you feel welcome.    Be aware there are two other servers that are not friendly and make you feel unwelcome as if they preferred you were not in the restaurant.  I've had the same experience with them two every single time.    I approached one of the managers ID as \"Amber\" and explained this to her and instead of taking this comment as valuable she was offended saying those employees have been working there for a long time and was like family.  She asked me to consider other restaurants.   That's was unfair and wrong - DISAPPOINTED!!!!"}
{"text":"I ate here one time and our group ordered about 19 rolls under the All You Can Eat.  Everything was real good and the food had a lot of flavor.  It's a nice place and I will return again."}
{"text":"I'm normally a regular there but recently the last 2 times I have gone their rice has been a bit under cooked not enough water. The rice has hard texture in it. I Was disappointed. I had told the waitress that and all they did was apologized and if I couldn't finish the rolls I don't have to eat it and that they won't charge me for it? I'm surprised no one has been complaining about the rice. Its not like how it used to be waste of $30...I don't think I'll be going back anymore."}
{"text":"This place is awesome..!!!! Great service, great food!!! I had salmon-skin salad n yaki Udon..!!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Service was excellent! I recommend the all you can eat. Ask for Amber!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. One of the best AYCE sushi places I've been to. 

I came here with my family (group of 8) and the service was on point. The food came out fast and the selection was really good. 

They allow an order for higher quality sashimi orders like toro when a lot of other places won't even allow it for AYCE. They also offered yellowtail belly which is amazing. Their rolls are a little smaller, which benefits the customer (in my opinion) bc it allows you to order other items without getting too full too fast. 

Thy also have a ton of dessert items. The \"Banana\" roll was a little weird but \"Ice Cream In Your Mouth\" roll was awesome. We also tried pretty much all the other dessert items. The tempura cheesecake was creamy goodness. The mini honey toast was simple but I loved it since it used a Hawaiian roll. 

This place is great. I think I even like it better than Sushimon, but it's hard to say that after only one visit. I will say this, if the service continues to be as it was for our party today, this will easily be the my favorite AYCE sushi joint."}
{"text":"I went back to Kaizen last weekend on 9/5/15 expecting the same quality and service that I got the first time around. It was not the same. There were fewer wait staff and I had to wait quite a while between orders and drink refills. I ordered one of their weekend specials again, the Sex Bomb roll, and it tasted nothing like it did the first time. Here I thought I'd found my new go to AYCE sushi joint but now I'm not so sure. Maybe I'll give Kaizen another chance if I don't feel like making a longer drive elsewhere."}
{"text":"Kaizen sushi may have been having an off day, but the sushi was mediocre and the service was abysmal. I came on the recommendation of a friend and It took 30 minutes to get our drinks and first round of sushi in. I'm pretty sure by all you can eat sushi, they meant to say all you can stand to wait for sushi. It was 20 minutes every time we placed an order. The sushi itself was alright and the only roll I really thought was unique and tasty was the mango salmon roll. If you are going to try it, make sure you have ample time and patience."}
{"text":"The sushi is good (7-10) but service is horrible. It took the waiter at least 5 to ask us for drinks and then it took over 20 min to take our order (they had forgotten whether we had ordered or not). If you do the all you can eat they take longer to ask if you want more, since you get an hour and a half to eat. Service is decent only if you sit at the sushi bar."}
{"text":"if you want sushi in the north/northwest - GO TO KAIZEN. my girlfriend and I are sushi fanatics and have tried everywhere on our side of town, but this place is the best. everyone I recommend it to falls in love! 
okay, it has the best food, but the service in the beginning was \"meh\". but now since they recognize us they seem to have stepped their game up! 
LALALOVE this place and love the atmosphere. the music videos playing on the wall is super fun."}
{"text":"I really want to like this plAce because of its location. but its just not consistent they have failed me 2 out of 4 visits. on my last visit I ordered to go and ended up with a fish bone lodged in the back of my mouth..."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!  We come here with friends!  Luis roll is the best! Sapppro is buy one get one free."}
{"text":"I've lived in this area of town for over 5 years, have driven by this place probably hundreds of times, and finally tried it.  Man, I've been missing out!  One of the best AYCE sushi places I've ever been to!  Sushi was fresh, the selection of appetizers was some of the best, and the atmosphere is great.  Not too loud, great music, super fast service, and varied selection of food.  Try a bunch of stuff, go for half rolls so you can stuff more in your face!  I'll for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Great all you can eat sushi restaurant right here on the north side of town!  Definitely try the Sexy Roll, the Sunrise Roll and the Monster Roll. However, everything was fresh and delicious. If you like to get your Sushi on, you're gonna love Kaizen!!"}
{"text":"best sushi in north Las Vegas very friendly clean environment. Adam was a great server very polite and helpful."}
{"text":"Service is top notch! Ann has been our server twice and she's great! The service is fast...the food is good...lots to choose from! Happy that there's a decent sushi place in this area instead of having to drive across town. 

Order: salmon killer roll, Hawaiian roll, monkey brains, tako yaki, beef fried rice!

What's cool is you can order not just sushi but fried rice, curry, ramen, and steak as part of the all you can eat. If you eat fried shrimp heads...its not in th menu but you can ask for it! They even have salmon and hamachi kama. 

Don't forget your fried cheesecake for dessert or tempura ice cream...or honey toast. They have mochi and ice cream as well. Ask for their stamp card, cause you will be back!"}
{"text":"Consistently this place has the best service, the most outstanding food, attractive atmosphere, and I have never left here unsatisfied... Best sushi place in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"We used to frequent another local sushi bar, but Kaizen won us over with their amazing selection of appetizers and incredibly fresh fish!

A must try is the Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent and prices run average for AYCE. even the appetizers and iced tea are simply delicious. The service was better than other places but nothing above average. The food is good enough to keep me coming back but don't expect the most attentive of servers."}
{"text":"Food was ok here for this time. 3 stars for the list of reasons:
1. Service: well, just so-so, AYCE style service way.
Always miss something that we ordered for many times. I have been here last year, (the servers weren't all professional) obviously they still improve their service in the future.
2.Food: ;) Just alright,thanks that sushi chef who made sushi for us alone.
3.Establishment: Okay, if I have to say what I liked so much that would be the bamboo. 

Ps:I used to come here for dinning with my friends, and I really highly recommend this spot to them before we came. Now I got so many negative feedback from my friends, for you all guys, I saw you just got a return order N turned back to serve the order to another table. That's why I said that words, you can't fool your customers like that way even at night, cuz we always know what you do for us, how much you cared about customers. 
DON'T DO THE SAME THING TO ANOTHER CUSTOMER, IT'S SO RUDE N INSANITARY!"}
{"text":"I am a little bit of a sushi snob, so if you are okay with mediocre sushi this place is great. All You Can Eat sushi restaurants are normally this way, and I would have never eaten here if friends hadn't dragged me for group events a handful of times. If you do find yourself eating here their cooked rolls are decent, but I would not recommend the baked or fresh fish rolls. My husband got sick from a baked roll and the fresh fish is very hit and miss. Good luck!"}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed in this place. This is the first time I come before 9pm. Arrived at 6.30pm on Monday,  the place looked super busy. My server name is Pear, always come by to check on us. We have 3 adult and 2 years old boy with us. For how busy they are, the food is awesome."}
{"text":"Japanese Style Chopped Steak 1 $11.95

I thought it was chopped steak....instead it was a full grilled hamburger patty with a side of sauce, rice and vegetables."}
{"text":"I ve been this place few times.
Today I want to write something for this restaurant.
The staffs and Food,,,,Amazing!!! Quality of foodis Great!!!
Im kinda picky but Im happy with this restaurant.
By far,,the best sushi place in Las Vegas.
It is All You Can Eat,,,,only$25
Wow,Wow,Wow,,,,I want everyone knows this Restaurant!!!

Must Go place!!!
I love this Place,,Really Good!!!"}
{"text":"This is our place for AYCE sushi. Staff is friendly, chefs are fast, and the food is great. They have a big menu for AYCE and we are always trying new rolls here. The store has a cool vibe and is a chill place to enjoy lunch or dinner. We've been all over town trying out different places, but Kaizen is just the best for AYCE."}
{"text":"Great quality sushi, fast service and best of all, A.Y.C.E.  and Happy Hour Sake specials."}
{"text":"1/30/16
Well, I had another wonderful dinner at Kaizen. The place was very busy but the wait wasn't bad at all. All the sushi was fresh and delicious. Service was outstanding as always. I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars. 

I will continue to update this post every time I eat at Kaizen. Hope you all enjoy.

12/29/15
This is my fifth trip to Kaizen and every time is fantastic. The sushi is fresh, the different types of rolls are wonderful. The service is outstanding. I never had to wait to have my drink refilled or to wait to get the sushi rolls. Even when the place is really busy, the service is outstanding. If you have a chance to go, I would recommend the AYCE to try the many different rolls they have to offer. If your not in the mood for AYCE, then I recommend there Bento Box."}
{"text":"AYCE is definitely the only reason my boyfriend and I keep coming back.  The fish is always fresh and the rolls are well made with a lot of variety unlike many places I've been to.  The fish to rice ratio is sometimes inconsistent, though, and the service here is pretty hit or miss-- more on the miss side. The last time we were here our original waitress didn't bother to let us know someone was taking over her tables since (I'm assuming) her shift was over, so we were waiting for a while for someone to take our order.  3 stars for the food, 1 star for the service."}
{"text":"One of the worst ideas for a web page. The Deer Springs restaurant is not listed as a location. The menu often doesn't have a description of what the dish is or have a picture. No mention of AYCE availability or hours or a list of available items for AYCE. I've been here once, but whenever I contemplate coming again, I look at their webpage and decide to go elsewhere, even though this restaurant is walking distance from my house. In today's world, a good web page can make or break a dining decision. It should help you anticipate what a great meal you will have, not leaving you wondering what is going on."}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi place in town. They have the best ayce menu. The deserts alone are worth the trip. My family and I come here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Interior decorum is nice. Service was prompt. Sushi quality was however lacking and even though their advertisement flyer stated 2 for 1 drink specials for their Wasabi Saturdays night, the waitress informed us they did not offer 2 for 1 drink specials on Saturdays. I am not a fan of restaurants that use misleading drink specials to lure customers in."}
{"text":"If you like fresh and good-tasting fish, stay away.  Years ago, before it was AYCE, it was much better.  Now, the fish is just bottom of the barrel quality. With so many sushi places around, there is really no reason to come here."}
{"text":"Finally in the northern part of Vegas there is a sushi restaurant that I would highly recommend the commute if you live or are visiting the Las Vegas area. I personally love sashimi and all you can eat sushi menu is typically skimpy of sashimi items or sushi rolls without rice.  However, Kaizen is not your typical all you can eat sushi place - there are plenty of sashimi varieties as well as rolls without the rice if you are watching your carb or just love the fresh fish. Further, their sushi and rolls are not just highlighting rice, but a great assorted sushi, rolls, and other tasty Japanese/Asian dishes.  The sushi chefs are friendly and welcoming as well as the staff. Finally and importantly, the restaurant is noticeably clean, which is to my liking.  Kaizen is currently my \"go to\" sushi place. I will post again if anything changes.  

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times in the last 2 months and every time I go back it gets better.  The Spider roll was the best I have ever had.  Oh and the tuna had perfect color and taste.  The servers are so helpful and friendly.  Did I mention the happy hour from 6-12am.  Discounts on the sushi, rolls and even the drinks.  Can't go wrong with that.  I think this is going to be my spot for sushi from now on."}
{"text":"They have the BEST chicken katzu and miso soup.  Their sushi is always on point, and the seaweed salad is great"}
{"text":"I had a Groupon for this location, so my husband and I tried it out. I wasn't too impressed. The service was great, but I wasn't really into the loud pop music vibe. The sushi itself was good, but nothing special. And I felt like it was overpriced. I did like the Korean BBQ sushi roll with the extra BBQ meat on the side, but if I'm craving Korean BBQ I'd just go to a Korean restaurant. I also got the \"I like my a**\" roll as I'd read about it here on Yelp, but again I just wasn't impressed. It was good, but not as good as other specialty rolls I've had. And I couldn't find a smoked salmon-cream cheese roll (one of my favorites) on the menu. Overall, I guess it just didn't compare to my favorite sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"we were very excited when kaizen first opened, sushi in walking distance is heaven to us. the decor is nice, the prices are decent, the service is good. but the quality of product (sushi) has been on a rather fast decline lately. we were just going for convenience, but have recently given up..we'll drive the xtra mile to sushi tachi from now on."}
{"text":"Very bad customer service!!! It's $23 for AYCE lunch. We ordered from the hot appetizer menu: Soft shell crab with sweet potato and ponzu sauce. The chef came back with a fucken spider roll!! He said its the same! I asked where the ponzu sauce and sweet potato was on the plate and he just walked away! So we ordered a Screaming O salad and it came with ONLY two slices of thin tuna and shit load of greens and slapped on mayonnaise on top!! We also found an old leaf on their too! Horrible place to go too!! I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THE PLACE TO ANYONE! If you are looking for good customer service, food and decent price.. stick to any sushi restaurant close to China town. Stay away from the suburbs that have a sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Clean and bright flavors with Friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food was great. The place was clean. It was small but cute and I would definitely come back often."}
{"text":"Went with friends on a friday night for a belated birthday celebration. Great night out. Food was good. Wait staff were attentive especially for a busy friday night. Parking can be a hassle so go early on a weekend. Overall loved it."}
{"text":"Great rolls with a fusion or raw and tempura. Good ambience and open late which is great for night shift workers like myself."}
{"text":"Had chef is very nice .....very good!  
restaurant wasn't  bed... ...but serving dish was chipped up and broken..
when  u served customer !! u can not use broken plate or cup!!
because.... safety-wise !!u can't use for customer chipping dish..."}
{"text":"I give this one star for the service. Prior to sitting down I specifically asked our waitress if they still honored the food stamp I had. (Buy 10 get 11th free) she said yes. We ordered 3 AYCE and 2 a LA carte. My husband ordered 3 rolls as the rest of us placed ours as well. He waited another 15 minutes after everyone received our rolls to get his first 2 and that's after reminding them he didn't receive his order yet. The place wasn't busy we were there early for dinner and only one other family in the place. They had 3 sushi chefs behind the bar? So i didn't understand why the service was so slow. The waitress and what I later learned was the manager kept watching us like hawks ( I told my husband it was like they wanted to make sure we weren't sharing with the 2 people who ordered a LA carte but it was becoming uncomfortable and didn't seem attentive). The server who was responsible for filling drinks was attentive and absolutely did a good job and with taking our plates away in a timely manner. When I asked for our bill I provided our waitress (the same one who told me she honored my card) my stamp card. She returned with the bill and charged me for 3 AYCE, stamped a new card and said I can get the free one next time. I explained to her that isn't how this works and she specifically said she would honor it before we ordered. She left saying she would ask her manager. She came back several minutes later and said he ok'd it but no more this was the last time. What???? She acted as if this was something I consistently did?? Mind you I use to frequent this restaurant a lot since its near my home (hence how I built up my stamp card) but never had I received a free AYCE before this night) BAD customer service and will not be returning. I would rather drive a distance somewhere else than to give them any more of my service. Lost a family of 5. I hope they take the time and read their reviews as its clear this (bad customer service) is a common occurrence with them."}
{"text":"outstanding service,  great great food must try the oysters and white gold. And tempera cheesecake.  Two"}
{"text":"I come here as often as possible.  Best AYCE I have had in Henderson.  The fish is fresh, the selection is large and the service is friendly and fast, even when it is busy.  I would recommend that everyone give this place a try.  It is addicting, and very reasonably priced considering the fact that I can devour sushi with the gusto of a trencherman."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we absolutely loved it! The service was excellent and the AYCE option was amazing. There was so much to choose from so definitely come hungry!"}
{"text":"Why have a patio, if you are never going to use it?!?!?!?!?!?!? Food is great but I come often and they never have the outside patio open."}
{"text":"Food was lackluster. Ordered takeout for lunch last week, probably the laziest looking cucumber salad I've ever seen, a peeled cucumber in slices krab stick and a small container of dressing. The food didn't seem very fresh, I asked for a spicy roll recommendation, and basically got a California roll with some spicy tuna. I guess I'll take the fault for not reading that deep into the menu. I'm new to the area so I guess I'll keep looking around for a decent sushi spot."}
{"text":"The rolls here are delicious! And the dessert choices are more than most sushi restaurants. The environment is very beautifully set up, and the server are one very friendly and taken care of their customers very well."}
{"text":"Me and my friend wanted to eat sushi and I remembered that this spot was next to Five Guys so we figured well give it a try, wish I went to any other AYCE sushi spot, this place sucked so bad, we order 3 different rolls that said they will have soft shell crab in it and all they had was imitation crab meet in it, actually come to think of it all the rolls were pretty much California or Philadelphia rolls with a different sauce on top, don't waste your time or money here, the only reason I give this place 2 stars and really it would be 1.5 stars if I can, is they had good ice tea and ice cream.
P.S
While we were eating I decided to yelp the place ( wish I did That before we went) and found out it was on ch13 dirty dinning. Hope I don't get the explosive runs"}
{"text":"The sushi here is excellent, everything is very fresh and has great flavor combinations. I tried their \"Spicy Something\" roll and it was delicious! Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"We wanted to try somewhere beside I Love Sushi since we always go there, and we might have found another place to add to the rotation.  They have 2 for 1 sake specials, which is right up our alley!  Not as much of a selection as I Love Sushi, and a little pricey, but the place was empty and we have good service.  They did accidentally charge our credit card twice, but we can't fault them for a mistake."}
{"text":"I gotta say One of the BEST AYCE place in henderson. 90% regular menu is included in AYCE menu plus late night AYCE special after 9 pm. 

First of all, i really like how there are so many appetizer to choose from. my favorite appetizer is baked mussel, tuna poke, seaweed salad, and some calamari tempura. and then when i look at sushi it's like wow.. fishes are so fresh that it is unbelievable you are in all you can eat place. 

I know there is a lot of 'cheaper' sushi restaurants especially in henderson because there are so many but i rather spend couple bucks more to get good quality of food than eating cheap foods."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but the portion sizes was tiny. I had there bento box with Chicken Teriyaki but there was more vegetables then chicken. It should have been called  Vegetables Teriyaki. Too much money for too little food. After dinner I went out to get another meal to satisfy my less than full stomach!"}
{"text":"I enjoy eating. I passionately eat out at many restaurants when I have the time and here at Kaizen, holds the spot as my favorite sushi joint. 

I would definitely recommend to come on the weekends; there's always a special, be it new fish, drinks, or even appetizers. It is always changing. 

I come to eat here for nigiri and a lot of the times I also order \"Fresh Wasabi\" it's a great add-on to nigiri so if you love nigiri I highly recommend you get that instead of the stock wasabi that comes with the meal. 

The menu is very large and you really do not need to only eat sushi here I honestly would come here just for the appetizers, the mussels and creamy shrimp are very good, actually a majority of the appetizers are good LOL, trust me I know. 

Ok my favorite roll here would have to be the Sex Bomb Roll

And my favorite appetizer would be the Baked mussel 

And my favorite dessert would be the creme brûlée"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town I've been coming here for years and I've never been disappointed! They have a wide selection of deliciousness in the entire menu!!!!"}
{"text":"I come to this establishment quite often and never experienced what I experienced tonight. Our server messed up on majority of our orders so things were coming out late. I complained to a manager and he said it took a long time because of a large party.... the large party he was talking about was a party of 8! I told him we asked for water refills a long time ago and never got it. All of a sudden our orders appear I think they honestly forgot our order and rushed it when we complained. Sucks I don't be returning"}
{"text":"Very clean, professional, and good selection of sushi. The quality is superb, the basic sushi they sell here is definitely the best bank for your buck. If your looking for a sushi place to fill up without breaking bank this is your place. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Amazing food and best service, I eat twice a week sushi and I just discovered this place and it's the best! People who know and appreciate good so she would love this place. I will definitely be back for many more  times"}
{"text":"This place use to be the best. Great, quik staff and they served brown rice, what a treat, but now that they've changes ownership you can tell they are cheap now. 
Only one waiter last time I went. Took foreever to get our food. The food was still great, but I can go somewhere else for the service"}
{"text":"The location on Paradise road is finesse! Do not come to this location. Horrible experience I'm typing now from the queens throne. I'm sick the miso soup I ordered was too watered down. My yellow tail shashimi was freaking RED and came out room temperature! And my rainbow tail was weak. How do you mess that up was probably due to overall experience. I'm telling all my friends avoid this location unless your looking for bubble guts and fish $hits aka food poisoning!"}
{"text":"The worse service ever!!!!!!!! 40-45 mins for sushi ridiculous!! Tables around were turning over and we still haven't gotten our order - took 4 follow-ups."}
{"text":"Pros: location- in the neighborhood, sushi is really good / different variety, clean open seating area, and quick service.

Cons: full staff but no one really talks- bare minimum, not too friendly... Bad customer service. 

Overall, I'll only return for take out since its in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"As usual, the food was great. The disappointing part of our experiance yesterday was the service, and some cleanliness issues. We did go early on a holiday, 4:00 pm, and almost seemed as though they might be in between shifts??? The staff was more concerned with eating their food, then serving us our sushi. The other concerning issue was the place was not clean. Our table was a hot mess, advertisement covered in old food/ sauces. The most disgusting sight was the room devider located near the front door. We had the unfortunate experiance of sitting next to the partition. Because of the slow service, we had ample time to glance at our surroundings. This partition was a foul mess. Covered in soy sauce splatter, food remnants, and a grayish colored film in the bottom. I am attacing some pictures due to the fact i am having such a difficult time describing the grossness that we endured."}
{"text":"Best restaurant ever. Food is incredible and atmosphere is even better. 

Absolutely would recommend!!!"}
{"text":"After several weeks of trying various sushi spots, my boo and I decided to revisit this location for 2 reasons. Reason #1: it was five minutes from the house! Reason #2: We noticed the banner for them winning the Review Journal's Best Of 2013 award.(the Paradise location). 
 The last time we were here was in January. Nothing negative to say, just not overly impressed. To our understanding, there had been a turnover, so we were excited to see what changes had been made. 
 Wow!! This place is fantastic!! Staff was friendly and very accommodating! I'm not sure why there were other people complaining of \"bad service\", because we got none of that! 
 The fish.....DELICIOUS!! Very fresh! This place is easily the best place that I have eaten at in the last couple of weeks! We will be coming back! And being five minutes away is a bonus! Super Bonus: As we were paying the bill, the nice girl that took our money asked if we had one of their stamp cards. I said......\"Whaaaaaaaaaaat?!?!\"
So your eleventh meal is free!! 2 down and 8 to go!"}
{"text":"This is our family's favorite AYCE sushi in town!
The quality of sushi & sashimi is outstanding. Also, wide variety of tapas and rolls makes Kaizen the best AYCE!"}
{"text":"This is is my Go-To Sushi place since it is around where I live and I am so glad that it is nearby! Such an awesome place, delicious food, and great service!"}
{"text":"The sushi was good but the dessert was not that great. I should have listened to the other reviews, the service was very slow which is why it's only 3 stars. They took very long to get our orders and they never even brought me my dang creme brûlée."}
{"text":"My husband and I moved to Henderson from NJ just right outside of NY city few months ago.  Needless to say, there was abundance of high quality sushi restaurants where we are from.  When we moved, we were not fond of all you can eat concept nor five million different types of rolls to chose from.  We simply wanted good quality sushi and we are so glad that we found Kaizen.  At first, we started by ordering individual sushi pieces, but soon realized that they use the same quality sushi for all you can eat.  Also, you can get various appetizers, rolls, awesome miso soup, etc from four page filled menu.  Everyone is very friendly and their service is very quick.  We've tried five other places and this is the only place we go now.  Also, each time you get all you can eat sushi, you get a stamp and 10 will get you free all you can eat.  If you are looking for good sushi, not rolls with Mayo and cream cheese, we highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"After a long day of work, the girl and I needed some good eats. There's not a lot of places open at 2am in the morning.

However, you best believe that Kaizen will satisfy your late night munchies with some flare. 

The crowd was most definitely people coming out from either the bars or looking to have some drinks/sushi. 

We were seated at the bar and began with some salmon and yellowtail sashimi.
     - hell yeah. Exactly what i needed. Fresh, marbly, and delicious. Squeeze some lemons and oh, ask for fresh wasabi if you're like me and like that shot to the nose. 

Then got some unagi sushi. Cause I love eel. Get that libido up gents.
       - Love it cause it's all warm on top of the rice and the perfect amount of eel sauce. Some places really drown it with the sauce but not Kaizen.

Proceeded next with some Spider hand rolls. 
       - What makes a good spider hand roll? The crab is fresh and crispy when bitten into. That crunch. Yass. 

Ended off our minimal courses with a roll which I forgot the name of D; but there was shrimp tempura, soft shell crab tempura, crab meat, & rainbow colored roe?? Anyways bomb :)

Definitely will be returning soon"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  Location is convenient for Northsiders.  The decor is beautiful.  Whenever I try a new sushi place, I usually get my favorite basics: maguro, hamachi, sake, amaebi, and uni.  I asked the waitress if the maguro was bluefin.  She asked the sushi chef, and returned with a \"no\".  Then I saw that amaebi was $9.50!  For $9.50, I thought maybe they had a tank full of live spotted prawns in the back or something, so I asked the waitress if the amaebi was fresh, and she said, \"yes\".  I clarified, and asked if the amaebi was live, and she said, \"no\". Disappointed and not wanting to spend a lot just to try this place out, I decided not to order a la carte.  I ordered the Sushi Plate, which consisted of 6 pieces of nigiri.  I am SO glad I did, because the sumeshi was hard (I guess they didn't put enough water in the rice cooker today), and all the fish and ebi was WARM (one of my pet peeves).  I inquired about Chicken Katsu on the Lunch menu, and the waitress insisted that it was the Kid's Menu, not the Lunch Menu. Whatever.  DH had the teriyaki chicken bowl, which was too sweet, with no flavor, and had the same hard rice.  We had to drown it with shoyu to make it edible.  The best part of the meal was the can of Coke!  When the bill arrived, there was a 10% off advertisement (I'm usually a sucker for discounts, but there is no way I'm coming back to Kaizen) for this and 2 other locations: one in Henderson and one across the street from Yokohama Kaigenro (obviously I would prefer to go to Yokohama Kaigenro instead LOL!)"}
{"text":"One of my husband and i's favorite sushi places. TONS of diverse types of sushi, sashimi, ramen, and other cooked plates. There is something there for everyone. Also has an all you can eat option for lunch and dinner and both are very reasonable in pricing. Fun upbeat environment as well. Smaller place, kinda feels like a hole in the wall so that's nice too. I would recommend not to sit at the sushi bar because the chefs get a little confused when it's busy, but overall very good service."}
{"text":"So so, it's trying so hard to find itself but as you walk in there you see 3 different tvs with 3 different things on at the same time and it isn't a quiet place to enjoy sushi. They aren't efficient with the all you can eat system here, the steaks are super small and the wait takes forever! Try at your own risk!"}
{"text":"When it comes to sushi I cant complain! I used to have to drive across town to get decent sushi. So when I found this place close to my home...Jackpot!! I prefer to sit at the bar. Thr chefs are hilarious and are a lot of fun. The sushi is soooo good.. I Especially enjoy the banana roll and ICE CREAM IN YOUR MOUTH..love the name...definately a nice environment to just come and hangout..and after 5 pm they have buy one get one free in drinks"}
{"text":"Very good service, amazing food and it's all you can eat. And the when you think you had enough go for the deep fried cheesecake, it's amazing dessert. I've been coming here a long time and will continue to come here."}
{"text":"Happened to find this restaurant while in Vegas. Very comfortable, like the decor, and the bathrooms are clean (big plus!) The sushi was melt in your mouth good! The prices are reasonable, but you get what you pay for. Luckily they had a 50% off for lunch. they also gave us free green tea ice cream! It was fresh! I'd definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"What can i say about KaizenSushi. It never disappoints. We come here at least twice a month, whenever i have craving for sushi. Plus it all you can eat. Their garlic tuna sashimi is absolutely divine. Their servers are always friendly and accommodating. Their chef know their stuff. All in all Kaizen Sushi is definitely 5s."}
{"text":"My go-to sushi / Japanese food restaurant. It help that I live just a few minutes away. But when I'm not in the mood to cook but still want something tasty, Kaizen is where I go. The wait staff is always friendly and quick. Often times, the sushi arrives before anything else.

For my money, the best roll on the menu is the Japanese Lasagna. I'm also a big fan of the Tempura Udon soup. Occasionally I'll go basic and just get some friend rice. Sometimes, though, it is a little too peppery. Don't go there thinking you'll be too social, though! The endless looping of music videos is sure to distract you. Did MTV use to be like that?"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Such a bummer the customer service and seating is such an issue. The last few time I come in I wait way to long even though there are empty tables then people come in after me and get seated right away. I've tried making reservations and there's always some excuse why I can't make them. I believe that an all you can eat sushi shouldn't be able to make reservations but the times I have waited it seems they only seat people who supposedly had made them. Which makes me think reservations are only for certain people. There is a lot of favoritism here and they don't treat every customer the same. Im so sad that I will not be coming back again after seeing empty tables and after waiting over an hour while other people get seats right away."}
{"text":"Hair in my teacup. Had to ask my table neighbors for silverware because the waiter couldn't remember after asking 4 times. Poor poor Customer Service. Although I was asked if my drink order could be taken 4 times by different people. No FOH communication? Smh will be taking my business to Sushi Loca!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was horrible. Not coming back. The place was empty so no excuses"}
{"text":"Food is yummy and service is bomb.com. seating isn't very cozy. Other than that it's pretty good!"}
{"text":"I just visited Kaizen's for the first time today and I bought my food to go. I selected the three item bento box and got it to go. I opened it up at home and was pleasantly surprised at the quantity of food. It was all for the most part, delicious!!! I selected the Korean BBQ short ribs, the chicken teriyaki and the shrimp & veggie tempura. My two complaints are that the chicken teriyaki was a on the sweet side and that the broccoli floret for the veggie tempura should definitely be cut smaller. That will allow for the tempura to cook all the way thru. Overall the experience was good and I will return for an in-house experience."}
{"text":"For several years while on business trips I was a regular at this place for lunch specials, a bento box with 2 items for $7+. I would put in a phone order frequently for dinner, quick and easy pick up for me, I'd be in and out knowing when I'd get to my destination  and open up the to-go meal it was a given that food was fresh, well prepared with good size portions. Good deals, fresh sushi for years. Service was good but it wasn't consistently great. It has slowly declined in recent years, and when the restaurant was sold just over a year ago the new owners cut back on the proportions, the long time servers and hostesses were replaced by new folks with heavy accents and mediocre service. After the first disappointment I gave it another go one more time in case it was a product of one bad day, same terrible service though, new menu with increased prices for 1/3 less quantity. They've lost my business along with a slew of other folks. I haven't been back in several months. Too bad cuz it used to be a favorite. I've lost confidence in this restaurant. 2 thumbs down!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's great if your doing AYCE and prefer rice with no fish...  otherwise this place sucks!  So many other decent sushi places in the area; don't waste money on this place.  I Heart Sushi is a thousand times better quality or just head to your local grocery store...."}
{"text":"love love love. go eat here now. the salmon collar will blow your mind. we are eating this delicious all-you-can-eat sushi explosion as typing."}
{"text":"Came in on Friday, February 5 for my birthday at around 10:45pm. Restaurant wasn't as busy so seating took less than 5 minutes. Our server was Saehui (as seen on our receipt). As excited as I was for sushi, let me just tell you that the service ruined it for me. I did the AYCE cause I love sushi and can eat a lot of it! Ordered a few appetizers, got 2 out of 3 that I ordered. She had a pen and a note pad and I thought she had written my order. My sushi came in one order at a time and with a 10 minute interval, but really felt like 15-20 minutes. Before you order, server tells you they charge extra for sushi you haven't ate. I ordered one baked roll that I liked but that roll sat in a platter on the sushi bar for more than 5 minutes. I was almost tempted to get it myself! I'm sorry but they deserved 1 star. Sushi could have been made faster with 3 sushi chefs and not much customers. Service needs work. Not to mention, my green tea ice cream took at least 10 minutes to come out. It takes less than 5 minutes: grab a bowl, scoop ice cream choice of customer, add a spoon and deliver to the customers table. Please Kaizen, let's work on food punctuality!!!!!"}
{"text":"We come here at least once a week. The all you can eat is no joke here. It's not just all you can eat sushi, it's more all you can eat menu! Hands down the best ayce sushi in the area."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place for all you can eat! It's about $25-30, and the service is fast! Food is amazing, of course, and when I want to get my sushi fix but am short on time, I order takeout. They are always quick to welcome me at the door, and my order is done super quick as well! My fave roll to order is Crazy Girl heheh

I also have to add that Wei is my favorite server. He is so happy, kind, and attentive!!! 5 stars"}
{"text":"We've lived here in Henderson for 2 1/2 years.  I don't know how we haven't eaten at #Kaizen-Henderson Sushi until  tonight!?  The service was great for the most part (considering how busy the restaurant was), and the sushi was some of the freshest we've had in a long while!   Everything we tried was delicious, but I think the best was the pepper seared tuna sashimi and the soft shelled crab with sweet potato!  I might even have to go as far as to say we've found our new FAVORITE sushi restaurant!"}
{"text":"Kaizen use to be a really awesome place, recently however the quality of service and food has declined. 
I came here on a dinner date and the place was packed but, we were seated rather quickly. A server came around a few minutes after and took our drink order and food order.
It took 25 minutes to receive our appetizers. We weren't fully annoyed because we knew the place was busy- however it became annoying when the person next to us who was seated way later received their rolls way before we received ours which ended up being a 45 minutes wait for THREE rolls.
We still had to wait 15 minutes for a hand roll. WHICH had one small piece of fish, some green onion and was entirely filled with rice. If I wanted rice I would of just asked for a bowl of rice. It was a terrible experience which sadden us because we were huge fans of this place. 

I recently came went back with my father for lunch and the rolls were falling apart the minute you picked them up and were over stuffed with crab mix with barely any cucumber and avocado. 

Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place. The ambience is nice, the bar is big the decor is cool. Their rolls are delicious and the price is great. They have this yummy lychee sake which we always get! My favorite rolls are the Sunrise and Monster, sooo good and baked mussels are a must have! The only thing that I didn't really like was the green tea ice cream, kinda had a weird taste. But the service has always extremely quick the few times I've been here and all the servers are very polite and kind. Will continue to come back :)"}
{"text":"So I love Kaizen I usually go to the one on paradise all the time and I was exited to see they had one on my side of town since I'm kinda of new to the north. Yelp said it closed at 11 we got there like 1015 and they told us they were closed I'm so pissed I understand y'all wanna go home but a business is a business if you're suppose to be open till 11 you don't turn away a quality customer.."}
{"text":"SUSHI: Fresh, clean, tasty. Overall excellent.

APETIZERS: eh... so so.  Not impressed. But its obvious the cooks in the back making them are basic denny's type cooks. 

SERVICE: At the sushi bar its great for sushi orders. Apps, drinks, and desserts can definitely have a long wait time. Depends on the day or time.

ATMOSPHERE: Pleasant, contemporary, and casul. Clean dining. 

Average all you can eat dinner price. 
Still one of the better AYCE sushi places in N. Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is a sad story. Its been past from owner to owner only getting worse in the process. It used to be great tasting sushi. Now if you can even get your order right its mediocre at best. the service is sooooooo awful and slow. i dont know if they dont understand you or if they just dont care. When you tell them you got something wrong they look at you so confused or not caring. I have been here many times but the lat several have now ruined this place for me forever"}
{"text":"This is my husband and my favorite sushi joint besides Nobu! The price is amazingly reasonable and the variety is extensive. Overall the dishes come fresh, well prepared, and worth the cost. We usually eat about $150+ worth of sushi so the \"All You Can Eat\" is remarkably priced for what we consume. I think it's the best reasonably priced sushi joint here in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Hello dear sushi eaters!

I've been here about 5 times now. I've ordered AYCE and from a la carte. All of my eating experiences have been great! Good quality sushi. Usually service is quite fast and the workers are efficent. 
I would suggest going AYCE if you are hungry because sometimes the difference from going a la carte, go AYCE are about $5 or $10. So minus well go for the AYCE so you could also enjoy appetizers (I'm looking at you, Dynamite and Clam Miso soup)  and desserts.

The reason I give 4 instead of 5, is because we have been treated slightly weird by the waitresses.  This last time, however, at least one of them recognized me, so I got a better treatment. 

Also... music is quite loud. I usually ask if they can lower it down. I really don't think having it as loud as they usually have it benefits the restaurant's environment. 

However, if you will like to enjoy some good sushi in North Las Vegas,  come here!"}
{"text":"A few friends and I tried out kaizen yesterday 11/20/13 for dinner.we've passed it a few times and always wondered how it was. So we have it a try. We walked in and the decor is very nice! They also have a projector playing music videos which is pretty cool. After a few minutes the waitress came to take orders. We got AYCE... Since we're new to the restaurant we were asking questions about the sauces,rolls etc because every sushi ayce does it different. We could see that the waitress was getting irritated so I told her I'm sorry but this is our first time eating here. We normally go elsewhere but decided to give this place a try. So if its good we'll recommend it to our friends. Her attitude kinda changed. I think she was trying to hurry up because shortly after she got relieved by another waitress who arrived.what I didn't find professional was that the initial waitress that took our order, had her son(looked 5yrs old) just sitting around on his iPad near a table by us..he would roam around and she would give him the go sit down look. Until she finally finished her shift and left. The waitress who took over was nicer. So we got a few appetizers like the ribeye,fried rice,yellow tail sashimi etc.. The were pretty small portions and some of the items you can only order once... My friend got the fried rice and as soon as she was going to take a bite.she noticed a piece of plastic in her food. The waitress wasn't around to tell but the busier was. He was apologetic and brang out  a new one. My friend wasn't pleased with the taste and didn't eat it. When the waitress came around we told her about the plastic and she did NOTHING about it. Not even a sorry. Nor a discount. Which was really displeasing because it seemed like no one cared. Anyway. Overall the taste of the food was bland.the fish didn't really have a taste.not fresh.. Service was descent. Environment of the restaurant was nice to look at but that's about it. I wouldn't recommend kaizen too anyone!"}
{"text":"If you like mushy rice, drenched sushi, and heavy rice in your sushi, then this is the place for you. Also, I don't recommend the miso soup. It tastes very diluted!

First and last time coming to this place. If you want good sushi I would recommend making a trip to Sakana! It is right near UNLV and they give u huge strips of fish with little rice."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants - perfect place to take friends when they're in town, but also great to just go b/c you don't feel like cooking dinner.  If you like sushi, make sure you try the seared ono.  No one does it better!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Mine and my hubby's favorite sushi place by far... great tasting, super-fresh food always... super service always- love the big smiles we always get when we dine here... and really reasonably priced- lots of specials! My favorite is the pepper-seared tuna and the \"special\" sauce they always get for us on the side that we love so much :) Great place to go, if you haven't tried it... you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"Horrible Food 
Horrible Rice
Horrible Service 

5 separate times delivered wrong food"}
{"text":"i love the food here...and i'm not saying that because i work here. i've bought food every day for the past week that i worked here. all of the salads are great (the dressing is really addicting)...the spicy tuna salad is probably the most popular. all of our tempura rolls are delicious. the most popular chef's special roll is the first kiss. and a lot of people seem to order our yellowtail sashimi with jalapenos. my favorite cold appetizer is the lemon tako (octopus sashimi w/ thin slices of lemon & sesame oil). and i love to snack on our sweet potato tempura w/ a drizzle of unagi sauce. we have some other off-menu items that you'll have to come in and ask about :)  i almost forgot...2 for 1 on all alcohol from 10pm to 2am every nite!!!

btw, my bosses didn't tell me to write a review here...i genuinely like it here. the sushi chef alex & everyone else is cool & laid-back."}
{"text":"I've been craving some sushi and had a groupon for Kaizen, so we headed on over. The menu is huge. We tried the Orange Blossom roll and even my sushi-disliking husband was won over. They also had a bento box deal that was great. We tried the Short-ribs, gyoza, and tempura shrimp. It was all very good. We'll be heading back, Groupon or not and recommending it to all of our friends. 

The prices for sushi might seem to be high, but for the LV area are pretty low. Their food prices are great."}
{"text":"Great service. 
Love the Lemon Roll.
The all you can eat makes it a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years.. The health department came in during my experience today and forced them to throw out all the sushi I was enjoying minutes before.  The owner showed up while I was finishing up (last roll ordered wasn't made) and I was not offered a refund even though I clearly saw what was going on.  As a restaurant employee I expect more care to be given to the customer's experience. I shouldn't have gone home without the owner coming by to apologize for watching the health department throw everything I had just been eating in the trash. 

Now I'm just not sure if I'm gonna cr*p my pants later."}
{"text":"The Place: Clean, Casual, Nice Decor
The Service: Friendly 
The Food: Ok

A friend and I went here randomly one night (as it's 2 minutes from my house) to check it out.  We edamame and a variety of rolls.  I feel the biggest selling point is the atmosphere. The sushi was so-so. My friend and I felt that for the money there are better places for Sushi in South Vegas / Henderson."}
{"text":"Kaizen has it all! The customer service is great and the food is even better! Our server Adam made the best recommendations, the atmosphere is lively and inviting. Awesome sauce!"}
{"text":"Just not fresh tuna or scallops. &Burnt salmon skin. Wilted lettuce. Even rice wasn't Japanese.. I did like the seaweed salad though. I just got take out but the service was very nice so I'm giving it a 2 stars for the ambience and how close it is. Even though I did pay $7 for an uber."}
{"text":"Tempura Udon is better than anything I had in Japan for the month I was there. Chicken curry bowl was bland and flavorless. SAshimi plate was fine, but probably better to do all you can eat."}
{"text":"El sushi no está tan bueno pero esta bien para el ambiente. Necesitan tener más postres y también poner el all you can eat sin el a la carte."}
{"text":"Their AYCE is amazing. So so good!! Also the green tea ice cream is crazy good. And the young bus boy is so sweet."}
{"text":"Great food. Favorite is Orange Blossom special. AYCE is great. They have a frequent ACYE punch card. We have come so much we used it. Comfortable. Been there many times in the past year. Love it."}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times and the service is great. We always get served by the same nice lady that remembers us. It was our first time for AYCE at Kaizen and the menu is great. For dinner, it's a little pricey ($27). But lunch is a better deal, only $22. You can choose from the whole menu except for a few items. I would definitely come here again for AYCE."}
{"text":"My daughter wanted sushi for her birthday. Decided to try this place for the first time. No one explained the \"rules.\" My daughter got the kids meal and we got the all you can eat. When my daughter finished her meal, she reached to grab one piece of her dad's rolls and the server, Kate, jumped to scold her. Telling her \"you can't eat that.\" Instead of speaking to us, her parents and explaining. My daughter hadn't been to a place like this and didn't know. Kate made my daughter feel super bad and she didn't want to eat the rest of the time. It ruined the mood. The place was nice, the food was good but the service is terrible!"}
{"text":"I have become a regular at Kaizen.  I have yet to have anything on their menu that isn't better than any other sushi place on Eastern, and I've been to them all.  My favorite rolls are the Snow White, Orange Blossom, Silver State, and Rock and Roll, and their sushi is as fresh as I've found off the strip.  I send my friends there all the time and have never been told it was bad advice."}
{"text":"Came here last week and i was disappointed. First of all nearly every sushi roll i ordered completely fell apart when i tried to pick it up. I don't know if there was a new guy working but it sure seemed liked it, they were definitely poorly done. Second of all i got extremely sick less than 30 minutes after leaving :/ The reason i gave 2 stars is because the service was great and fast even though it was swamped in there. There are too many other sushi places too try this one again."}
{"text":"Only reason this place gets two stars is because of the food quality. Service is probably the SLOWEST I have ever experienced at an AYCE spot. Food came out 20 min apart for things such as half rolls, calamari, nigiri..pretty much everything we ordered. Oh and to top it off, the one time my friend ordered a cocktail, the server forgot about it so we had to ask about it 15 min after the order was put in. 

In the very beginning servers were ensuring we were serviced, but as the meal went on, we were left with NO service. I had to flag down servers, which left me feeling like I was an annoying customer, but literally it would had been no different to dining in at mc Donald's. 

To really set the night, (3 hours later) I asked one of the servers, kindly, for our check; another 10 min pass by with no check and I'm over it. So to save them a trip, my friend and I ended up walking to the podium in the front to pay. I'm so upset bc the sushi was really good but this place left me with a horrible first experience. I will definitely not be suggesting it to anyone who asks about AYCE sushi recommendations, unfortunately."}
{"text":"great sushi. The spicy octopus is the best. The prices are reasonable. Geo is the best waiter there. The rest are okay but he is really good, quik and very friendly."}
{"text":"First time here with my hubby.
Some good some so so..
I order couple rolls. It's too much rice...but it's okay.
I'm not highly recommend."}
{"text":"A while back this place needed some help with the sushi. The fish and rolls has improved since the last time I came. The portions are small that way you don't get full too fast. The only drawback is they only have one waiter to wait on tables (lunchtime). Overall, I give it 2 thumbs up and wil make this my new sushi go to place!"}
{"text":"lets be honest here, its AYCE sushi, so quality is not expected, but when EVERY sushi order is filled with CRAB filling it is quite dissapointing and disgusting!. 

From teriyaki chicken to eel to salmon, every roll was filled with crab meat. 

Simple way to cut on costs and lose customers.. F**k this place."}
{"text":"It's a shame I have to give this such a crappy rating because the food is delicious but the SERVICE IS TERRIBLE! I cannot believe how horrible of an experience I had with the service. When it comes to sushi bars, I also like the chefs to come off friendly and approachable. These chefs seemed like they could care less about what we would like to order next.

So, first thing, me and my friends walk in and sit at the bar. I noticed my spot didn't have a small dish for soy sauce so I requested one from the waitress. I must have requested it 5 times before she actually gave it to me. Then, since they don't serve sake bombs, you have to buy sake and beer separate. They have a \"buy one get one free\" drink special. So my friends bought 1 sake and 1 beer and got maybe a few sake bombs out of it. Completely uninformed about the rules of the \"buy one get one free\" special my friends got charged full price for both sake and beer. The waitress was well aware that we were under the impression it was going to be \"buy one get one free\" but failed to tell us, probably didn't care to. To put the icing on the cake, as I was checking my bank account and the waitress charged me an extra $5 for tip. What an inconvenience! That server was terrible and if she keeps that up they will go out of business."}
{"text":"Soooooo good! Food was amazing!!, menu had Soooo many choices;we wanted to try everything!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"4 years ago this place was AMAZING! I dont know if they changed owners or what. The last 4 times i have ordered from here the food has been either dried up or burned. They are not consistent with their recipes either. Sad that they changed their recipes they used to be sooo good!"}
{"text":"I am a self proclaimed sushi snob (ok salmon nigiri mostly) and my son only frequents all you can eat sushi restaurants of a highly rated caliber...we were both over joyed to find Kaizen on Eastern.  I was a little reluctant because of the star rating...not being t least a 4.5, but decided to try it and was very pleasantly surprised at the high quality of fish."}
{"text":"Thus is one of my favorite sushi spots in town.  I literally come here every week. The food is great and the staff is amazing. They are always on point here and service is very fast.  The mini honey toast is a must try with All You Can Eat. It's delicious!!"}
{"text":"Love the AYCE menu items and amazing fresh oysters too! The service is always great and the food is always delicious. Favorite sushi spot in town! Also love the stamp card program to receive a free comped all you can eat meal"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch when your craving sushi. They have lunch special that runs 12-15 dollars a meal. Pretty good size for the price. One of my go to place in northside for Japanese meal fix."}
{"text":"Super delicious, great service, superb specials!!  Try it, you'll like it!!"}
{"text":"This place definitely deserves 5 stars! I would strongly recommend this place if you want great quality of sushi/rolls, also, appetizers are so delicious. The service was even greater . The waitresses are all very friendly, nice, and they take really good care of the customers. Very romantic place at night time. I really liked the atmosphere with the new interior lighting. It really sets a warm welcoming moon."}
{"text":"2nd time here. We were able to walk right into be seated at 7 pm on Mother's Day. AYCE has a wide selection, and we enjoyed our food very much! Our son doesn't like sushi much so he ordered from the al a carte menu and got ramen and one fruit sushi roll (1/2 roll). They served him a full roll, and we brought it to their attention, so they took the roll back. The server then brought back the full roll and said it was their error and would charge us for only 1/2 roll. My son ate his 1st piece and then they came back explaining they were sorry but the manager said they had to take the other 1/2 of the roll back. Really????? He already ate off the plate!!!! Seems to me that it wouldn't be worth irritating your customer and losing 1/2 of your tip to take back 4 pieces of sushi. We reminded the server not to re-serve that sushi to anyone else, as it would be a health code violation. They assured us they just threw it away, then why did you take it away in the 1st place?"}
{"text":"Great service and very friendly staff. Even though it was a busy Friday night. All servers remained calm and cool. The manager even walked Buy to ensure every single customer was enjoying themselves. The food was absolutely amazing and features a wide variety of traditional and fusion sushi. My wife is gluten intolerant and they accommodated her very well. You also get a card to receive your 11th all you can eat for free. I'd eat there every day if I could afford it."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and its just right around my neighborhood, Good for north Las Vegas resident like I am & don't have to drive far to get good sushi restaurant which is a plus for me. This place is steady during weekday. They have a good lunch menu with affordable prices. Although they only have one server, but for sure I was taken care off. Clean nice atmosphere. Good food, good price and Kudos for a place like this."}
{"text":"This place has some good food at a really good price. If you would like to go to a sushi place with stereotypical appearance and j-pop as well as other music playing with decent food at a good price then go here. If the appearance is not a concern because you value good service over aesthetics and a non restricting all you can eat menu then head south on Alienate and go to Sushi Tachi better food, better service, cheaper booze. Not really sure about the booze thing since they're basically the same price. Just remember appearances aren't everything."}
{"text":"Miso soup was delicious. Quick and kind service. Basic sushi rolls have generous amount of fish for the price. Will come again to try more!"}
{"text":"This place is the best all-you-can-eat sushi spot I've been able to find so far. All the rolls we ordered were devoured, and we tried a lot from the menu. Definitely a solid Vegas ritual restaurant for me."}
{"text":"The food was  good. Typical sushi place. I only have one issue; our server was clueless. I asked if they had any combination specials and he said only for lunch. So I ordered a lot of ala carte items. They have AYCE but was not in the mood for it. Then I noticed a big sign on my table listing the bento box specials for both lunch and dinner. Stupid me for not noticing but he should have informed me. I have no problem paying for food that I like and  want but our bill would have been reduced by 30% if I did not order separate items. Next time I shall pay attention.

I think AYCE is worth it because some of the rolls were $15. You order two of those and it's already cheaper per person. Then order nigiri sushi and continue with the gluttony."}
{"text":"The decor and atmosphere of the restaurant is great, but that's about it.
I ordered the AYCE and the salmon roll was the fishiest I've ever tasted- not fresh. And the chicken kustsu barely had any chicken on it. 

The  waitress did not smile once and acted like the customers were a burden on her. It took well over a minute for them to seat another couple and nobody acknowledged the customers when we first walked in. It wasn't worth the price at all and I won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi bar!!!! Must try the Orange Blossom roll. Great service and staff. Gets crowded sometimes."}
{"text":"Bomb place , definitely coming back , food was awesome very fresh and tasty , place open until 1am which is the best part you can come after movies and eat bomb sushi..... Two thumbs up for sure"}
{"text":"AYCE- Service was horrible. Food came out SO SLOW. Our waiter came to our table 10 min after we got there, and said \"do you want to order anything else before I go on break\" we did not see him again after that. We basically had no server taking our orders anymore. Water needed to be refilled, green tea we ordered never came out. They tried to give us a roll we didn't order and tell us we did. Food quality SUCKED. Next time go to I LOVE SUSHI down the street where they are on point and we always have a good time and great food.

Manager wouldn't even come out to speak with us after we asked to speak to one !"}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite sushi place but last times it got worst and worst... Last time for example we were here and stayed 20 mints at the table and nobody cared to come ask us anything. Like we were invisible)we were hungry but mad about that and left. After 1 month of eating sushi in other places we came back today . We stayed like 10 mints at the entry( nobody came ask us if we want a table or so) it was pretty full and just one server. He finally came ask us if we need a table and then we told him what happened last time and why we didn't come here since. We also asked him if today he can take care of us not like last time. And he said smiling\" today maybe is going to be the same\" my husband couldn't believe what he just said. So he asked him \" how so?\" The waiter answered\" well is going to be like 30-40 mints untill i can take your order\" so we said \"ok we're leAving\"... he let us leave. Very rude! Since i moved in US It never happened this to me . People usualy apologize and then make it up ... i will never come back here anymore."}
{"text":"I came here last night and I am definitely a fan! I eat sushi all the time so I can tell when its quality stuff.

Right when we arrived, the waiter let us know that it was happy hour, so we ordered two small bottles of nigori sake at buy 1, get 1 free! He even let us know that if we ordered a larger bottle and didn't finish it, they would label it and keep it in the back for us so we would have it for our next visit. What restaurant do you know that does that? Awesome!

The company I was with knew the sushi chef and the chef let us know right away what the freshest fish of the day was. So that's exactly what we ordered.

We had 2 orders of each:

Yellow Tail Belly
Albacore
Mackerel
Freshwater Eel
Tuna
Salmon
(I'm forgetting a few)

All were melt-in-your-mouth DELICIOUS! I have to point out the Eel, because normally, I don't like Eel because some restaurants drench the eel is over-the-top sweet teriyaki sauce, but not at Kaizen. Wow, the way they prepare the eel is perfection and only brings out the natural beautiful flavors of the fish. Also another plus is they didn't use too much rice in any of the sushi where its overbearing.

Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! The food is amazing and the decor is pretty cool. My wife and I make it a point to go there every time we're in henderson. My fav is the corn-roll and the crispy tuna dish.  Some white-fish thing with citrus app is great. AND, you have to order the fresh wasabi. only place i know that serves it. 

The great thing about their menu is that even our friends who don't like sushi have so many choices. Their curry is pretty good and the portions are huge.

great place!"}
{"text":"Have been coming to kaizen for 3 years and love it. Favorite sushi restaurant in las vegas"}
{"text":"Slow slow slow service. Better to go north on eastern a bit more to a diff sushi place."}
{"text":"Great place awesome food and service huge menu for all you can eat!! Very reasonably priced as well"}
{"text":"Came in on a Tuesday night at 6pm. Awful service: food took forever, came out in the wrong order, and items were missing. Took about 2 hours for what should've been a relatively quick dinner. For 2 people it was almost $80. There are so many good sushi places around. I will not be back to this one."}
{"text":"Soooo yummy! All you can eat lunch for $21.95 from 11:30am-4:00pm and dinner $26.95 from 4:00pm-12:00am. Service is ok.... But the food makes up for it. The crazy girl roll is the BEST!! Don't forget to ask for the stamp card.. buy 10 get the 11th free. Definitely not hard to buy 10."}
{"text":"Overpriced and Unoriginal.....


The space in Kaizen is very nice, with bamboo, nicely stained wood communal tables, and just the right amount of light to create a very chilled out ambience.  Even though the space is quite nice, there are a few major issues with the experience as a whole.  

We sat at the bar around 11:00 on a Saturday night, along with 5 or 6 other people in the restaurant.  It was not very busy, and the other diners were enjoying their food when we ordered.  Like other reviews have stated, the chefs take a long time to prepare your sushi here.  When it did arrive, I was fairly disappointed.   

The prices I list are ballpark, as I can't recall exactly what they were.  We decided on the following:

A trio salad plate (I can't recall the name) - This appetizer included a seaweed salad, octopus salad, and tuna poke.  The octopus was quite good, being flavorful and tender but the poke and the seaweed left much to be desired, both in texture and flavor.  ($8.95)

Tuna Sashimi w/ garlic ponzu - Awkward cuts of tuna drowning in a sauce that just didn't taste quite right.  The presentation was nothing special, and the flavors were forgettable.  ($13.95)  

Tuna, whitefish wrapped in Cucumber, no rice  (again the name eludes me) -  Six pieces a little too big to eat in one bite arrived on the plate.  This wasn't too bad, but for $13.95 you must have something exceptional in that roll, and exceptional was no where close.  


I don't understand the prices for this place, they are way too high for the product.  You can pay these prices at a few other sushi restaurants in town and get a much better meal."}
{"text":"Really good quality for AYCE. Service is fast and sushi is quick. They don't try to serve you slowly like others I have gone to. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place rocks.  My wife and I have been to many sushi places all over the world and when it comes to quality with value, Kaizen ranks pretty high up.  All u can eat is made to order from their sushi menu with about 90% of their menu available.  

The people their are very friendly.  We go with our neighboors all the time.  Pretty much our go to sushi place when we go out or have visitors in town.  Highly reccomend them."}
{"text":"I was dinning here with my wife.. I order the BBQ sushi roll, after my wife received her food, I waited patiently for mine.. after 27mins since I made the order my food finally came.. but before that I got up and spoke with the waiter and said , \"how come my food is still not here? Three separate customers came well after us and received there sushi and food. My food still has not arrived.. instead of making the situation better, some stupid women got up and said a few things to the employees and she said I was mental. Why? Because I told my wife that I will not dine here? Why was the women even listening to my conversation? Horrible experience and I will not done here and please beware of this restaurant and the mental customer!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Everything gets 5 stars.
Sushi Quality
Service
Cleanliness

All of the Sushi Chefs are so kind. Also, my favorite waitress is Pure. She is the absolute best!!! 

My favorite items on the menu:
Garden Salad with Ginger Dressing
Plum Wine
Lemon and Dragon Roll
Teriyaki Bowl
Green Tea Ice Cream
Creme Brulée 
Strawberry Mochi 

I cannot say enough great things about this place."}
{"text":"The first time I ate here, I thought the sushi was very mediocre and that it didn't taste very fresh. Though, my friend wanted to eat here a few days ago so I decided to give it another try.. I'm happy I did! I ordered two rolls, the Japanese lasagna and Mexican. Both were absolutely delicious and fresh tasting. Don't skip dessert either; their honey toast was some of the best I've had. Service was a tad slow, but nothing I couldn't deal with. After my second visit, I would definitely recommend this place to suffice your sushi cravings!"}
{"text":"Really nice sushi joint with cozy atmosphere good sushi and service , this was my first visit here and I am really happy with it. Outside patio was also nice but we sat inside, simply good sushi place , will come back for more"}
{"text":"Chef Han is amazing.
Da best chef so far!!!
I ve been this place before Han took over this place.
It wasnt worth to try but now it is totaly diffrent ,,,servers,staffs,chefs,,,
Very friendly, helpful and Sushi quality is Amazing!!! Fresh fish ever!!!
Everytime I visit las vegas,I go this place for meals with my friends.

You should try this!!  The Best sushi restaurant in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Was there last week with my wife and daughter, 
My wife's coke was flat, mine was okay, i drank mine right away. I let one of the servers know about my wife's drink, she said okay, (assuming she seen my empty drink and that she would bring a new coke for my wife, she would return with two drinks)
20 minutes goes by And NOTHING happens! There are only 4 other tables in the whole place! So I tell another server that comes by about what happened and guess what, she comes back with ONE drink to replace my wife's flat coke and no refill for me! I had the chicken katsu which should be called paper katsu cuz that's how thin it was, served with broccoli and mushrooms that were salty but okay, my wife had a sushi roll which was good, chicken katsu however epic fail, don't get it ! Servers are inexperienced either that or they just don't care! will not be going back to this place!"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service.
A bit pricey.
It wasn't spectacular, but it wasn't bad. 
Overall, average."}
{"text":"Good place for ayce In the southeast. Lots of different rolls to choose from. O roll, Snow White, and double yellowtail are tops. Baked mussel and oyster shooters are very good."}
{"text":"We went in for a quick lunch. We ordered the lunch combo roll special. Great price for the amount of food you receive! The soup was tasty. Salad has fruit flies .
Rolls were packed full and tasted fresh. They were made a bit sloppy. When picked up the fell apart. They were cut in all random sizes. There was no way I could fit a few in my mouth .
Service...Top notch! Attentive and fast!"}
{"text":"We have been here more times than I can count and 5/13/16 was by far the worst experience ever.  

We normally sit at the bar or close to it, so we have never had the server that we had on Friday. Not sure if it was so busy or just cause she was in a bad mood but more than once she advised us of being charged extra if we did not finish our orders.  

When we first ordered the AYCE for my husband and I, she looked at our kids (who are 13 and 16) and told us \"you cannot share the all you can eat\". We told her, we knew, and they would be ordering something else! That right there was the first incident.  When we ordered the 2nd round of rolls, she asked if we were getting full or half rolls because we would be charged extra.  That was the second time she told us.  When she was bringing us the check, she looked down at the 5 remaining pieces and said \"I can charge you the extra for what you did not fin..\" And I cut her off by telling her that we were not done yet! 

I told my husband when we left that we would only come again at lunch and sit at the bar.  But for now... We will continue going to Sushi Tachi across the street where the severs are much more friendly, even on a busy night!"}
{"text":"Last night was my first and last experience at Kaizen sushi. We came to the restaurant at 530 with a party of 9. They informed us that it would be a 15-20 minuet wait. The waiting area for this restaurant is very small, but yet so is the restaurant. After about thirty minutes, I asked how much longer and they told me 15-20 minuets again. By this point I was a little irritated. We could have gone to another establishment by this point. After another 15 minuets all we saw open were random tables of 4 and everyone after us kept on being seated. Half of our party left and went to Buffalo Wild Wings because they were starving. So me and my friend stayed with our daughters. When they seated us at a 4 top table someone came and took our drink order. I immediately asked for edamame because we were so hungry and she told us \"I'll go get your server\" when our server arrived he wasn't even looking at us while we ordered, he was so distracted by how busy it was. I place an order for two rolls, a chicken bowl, and a side of whole rice. When the food came out 20 minuets later, he forgot the side of rice for our little one. I didn't see him again for about another 15 minuets. We had a spicy tuna roll and both of us didn't get refills on our water until I finally flagged someone down.
We then wanted a specialty roll and ordered it. About about ten minuets we were so over it we asked for the check. The server couldn't have gotten us out of there fast enough. When the check arrived our special roll wasn't on there. I asked \"did you take it off or forget to put it on?\" He told is he forgot to ring it up. We were literally sitting there waiting for a roll that would have never came! To apologize he handed us two GIANT bags of fruit snacks right in front our our kids without asking us! This experience was a joke. The sushi rolls weren't that great. The restaurant is tiny! I wouldn't go there with more than 4 people ever. The service was terrible. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I have nothing good to say about this place at all."}
{"text":"After all that mediocre fish I decided to try their steak. Bad idea. Just cause we're doing ayce they short stroked me with this sad piece of meat. Pass this place and stick with Sakana and hikari."}
{"text":"Nice decor, attentive waitstaff, excellent value for AYCE.

I went with all nigiri this time:  salmon, tuna, seared albacore, yellowtail belly, toro, mackerel, smelt roe, and sea urchin. Near perfect balance of size, temperature, and flavor.

I will definitely return."}
{"text":"My family and I have eaten at this restaurant on many occasion, but this will be the last. The service was atrocious. They were more worried about a to go order than the people sitting in there restaurant. My daughter and I were already done with our meal before my wife even got her order. Their excuse, we had a big to go order. Seriously? It may not seem like much, bit we will take our 300 dollar a month sushi habit somewhere else."}
{"text":"Good sushi, not great. There was a HUGE variety, which I really liked, & a nice mix of many different flavors, as well as baked, or fried rolls. Most of the tempura rolls were actually regular rolls made w/ tempura something or other rather than an entire rolss fried, which I really liked bc what is the point of sushi if it's totally unhealthy anyway right? My personal fav was the green chili roll but my gf lked the holy cow the best. I felt everything could have been just a little more well executed, many of the rolls were starting to fall apart when they arrived at our table, & I was also disappointed at how many of the rolls were smaller than 8 pieces. Even during happy hour it was nearly $50 for 5 rolls which isnt BAD but, w/ ayce sushi on every few blocks around here I think they should really step it up. Next time I will definitely be looking more into their extensive app selection."}
{"text":"This place would be a great if it wasn't for the HORRIBLE service.  I coke here on occasion bc they have really good sushi, but every time the service just keeps pushing me further away from wanting to come back.  The sushi takes awhile to be served and you're lucky if the waiter comes by to refill your water to to check up on you.  If you're going to get All You Can Eat, make sure u order a lot at once...cause you're going to be waiting awhile between rolls.  This isn't just a one time bad experience review, it's been the same thing every time.  Step your service up, hire more people...whatever it is you gotta do.  And please open up the outdoor area, idk why they don't let you sit out there."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best AYCE sushi places I've been too. All the nigiri was pretty fresh and they have a good selection. They even offer toro(fatty tuna) but that's only one order per AYCE customer.

Their rolls are also pretty good. They have a wide selection and they are all very well made. They also have specialty rolls such as the OMG and I love my ass roll. (Both pretty good)

They also have a lot of appetizers to choose from. Definitely more than any other AYCE sushi place I've ever been to. If you go you absolutely HAVE TO TRY THE PORK BELLY. Absolutely delicious. (Also only 1 per AYCE customer)

Only negative I have for this place is that they are a little slow but good food takes time and love :)"}
{"text":"It's been two years since my previous review, and following the advice I gave -- it was a very pleasant dining experience, upgrading from 4 to 5 stars! I have to reiterate the same points: 

- SIT AT THE SUSHI BAR. The chefs are on point with their service and are very kind! Make sure you tip them too!
- ORDER AYCE. It's $26.95 for all-you-can-eat dinner, which is easy to accumulate with the sushi rolls ranging from lowest $8.95 to as high as $16.95. Plus, it lets you also order from the appetizers, entrees & desserts! Easily worth it!
- ASK FOR HALF ROLLS. If you're not sure you'll like something, start with a half roll. Instead of getting stuck with something you don't like, getting 4 pieces versus 8 helps! Then, if you love it, you can always order it again. ;)
- GET A STAMP CARD. You get a stamp for every all-you-can-eat you purchase... and after ten of them, you get one AYCE meal for free! They should give you one with your check, but if you already have a card, make sure you let them know because you can't combine cards!

In terms of what we ordered: 
- CRAZY GIRL ROLL
- CRAZY BOY ROLL
- SILVER STATE ROLL (my #1 fave!)
- OMG ROLL
- VEGAS ROLL
- LASAGNA ROLL
- ROCK N' ROLL ROLL (no rice!) 
- ENERGY ROLL
- BAKED GREEN MUSCLES (we got 6 orders!)
- TUNA POKE (comes with seaweed salad)
- YUMMY YUMMY CRISPY TUNA
- YUMMY YUMMY CRISPY SALMON
- CREAMY SHRIMP (wonton)
- CRAB SALAD 
- DYNAMITE 
- CRISPY SOFT SHELL CRAB
- CAJUN ALBACORE SASHIMI
- SMELT EGG NIGIRI
- SALMON NIGIRI (drizzle with lemon!)
- UNAGI NIGIRI 
- FRESH HALF SHELL OYSTERS (limit 2 pieces per person)
- HONEY TOAST
- GREEN TEA ICE CREAM

Everything was so fresh and delicious. The service was excellent as well! The menu is very extensive and we will definitely be back soon to try out more. :)"}
{"text":"@Ohana4Mama Poor customer service.  Seating procedures were quite unfair.  Lady with larger party checked in after us and pleaded to be seated before us, which the hostess accommodated much to our horror!"}
{"text":"I honestly used to love this place when I ordered online.... but when I got off from a long shift at the mall I got treated like shit. Basically my friends and I had a waiter disappear on us. 30 minute waits to just order on our \"all-you-can-eat\" and on top our food was cold when it was supposed to be a baked or fried rolls as we watched it sit at the counter... again I used to love this place... I guess if you're 20-30 avoid them because they generally treat young people like shit."}
{"text":"It's ok..the salmon sashimi with sauce and the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeños was really good the nigiris were mediocre...the sea urchin and oysters I do not recommend it was not fresh...but the rolls are pretty good I do think it was great that they do half rolls..but overall it was just okay...the service at first was a little slow but once people left it got better...I'm not sure if I would be back for the AYCE but maybe for a la Carte..."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight with four other friends and everyone loved it. We have been to numerous sushi places around tow. And defiantly would rate this in the top 3. All of us did the all you can eat, which includes access to a sushi salad bar they have which is very good. We had numerous roles and I recommend trying the ice cream in your mouth and the banana role. Both is something you must try, I did t think I was going to like it but we all decided to try it and all of us liked both of them so much we had to order more. The selection of roles was quite large and all of them were very tasty. I strongly recommend this place to anyone who is a sushi lover, I'd give it a 6 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Pros: Huge menu, friendly staff, easy to get to, open late

Cons: A bit slow when it gets busy

Details: My favorite AYCE sushi location. I have several \"favorite\" rolls here including Kiss of Fire and Japanese Lasagna, but there are a ton of great ones. I have only had one alcoholic drink but it was good. The service is typically great, unless they get slammed then it is good. Also the food is consistent, which I find important because I have been to other sushi places and gotten a completely different dish when ordering the same item on two different visits. The Kaizen seems to be really on top of what they provide and I recommend going, though suggest checking it out during non-peak hours."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite sushi places. Come here all the time. AYCE for most items. Their prices are great and variety of flavors. I am pescatarian so I haven't try their spicy seafood ramen yet ( pork broth) but the miso ramen is pretty good."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time to satisfy spontaneous sushi craving. I wasn't sure what I was really in the mood for so the all u can eat menu seemed a wise choice. It was. The food was pretty good and I like that most of the sushi was available in half orders so it allowed for a variety of options to try. They were pretty lenient about the sharing policy which was appreciated. 
With all that said, the servers were a little scattered. One server took our order, few mins later another came to take our order, another would give us wrong order. It was little chaotic. 
Some of the food took way too long. The menu does state some items take longer to cook such as the ribeye and pork belly but we waited almost 30 mins. When we told them to cancel it, it came out within 5mins after telling the server(?). 
Would I try again? Yes. I would give a second try."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this sushi place! Their sushi is phenomenal and on top of that their customer service is amazing. For their AYCE they have so many options for you to choose from. 5/5 highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"First time here, this place is amazing. I went with the AYCE, what a great selection. The combo varieties, quality and you can do half roll too, that being said is excellent and service is non rushed wow, how great. Although it took sometime and as simple as it is the bacon wrapped scallops were awesome.
You won't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Strange mixed bag here. 
The food that we got was good - although it was not necessarily what we ordered.

We sat at the sushi bar, and were immediately greeted by several very pleasant servers in quick succession. The first took our drink orders. The second took our first sushi order.  The third, fourth, and fifth, we just thanked politely.

Even though it was not crowded (many open tables, and an almost empty sushi bar) it took about a half hour to get our first few pieces of nigiri sushi. We never did get the rolls that we ordered.

The rest of the evening was a drawn-out comedy of lost orders, wrong orders, random rolls, and some pretty good food. In general, the rolls were overly sauced for my taste. I actually like to taste the fish.

So: Clean place, friendly waitstaff, totally confused ordering process, heavily drowned rolls.

All of this I can forgive - but here's why I probably won't return: 

I don't like restaurants with TVs. I mean, in a sports bar, sure - but not in a place where I want to enjoy a meal with a friend. They are conversation killers. People (especially guys) are constantly getting distracted. Kaizen has many big-screen TVs - with at least one in any direction that you look. 

I want to enjoy my meal and conversation uninterrupted by an ADHD nightmare of football, music videos, and flashy ads for the restaurant in which you are currently dining (?!?) all playing concurrently. Too much for me.

...and a note about the oysters: I love oysters, and was excited that they were part of the AYCE menu here. Sadly, I did not like the sauce that was served on the oysters at all. Again - I want to taste the oysters. These were presented primarily as a conveyance for the sauce.

2.5 stars, rounded up for the friendly staff."}
{"text":"If you love Sushi. This place i highly recommend.  Service are awsome. Food are sooo good i would come again and again.."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I have had in Las Vegas, always great staff and amazing dessert! If you are looking for fresh fish and friendly staff this is the place."}
{"text":"I have high expectation for this place due to the good reviews I have read but I am really disappointed when we got to dine here today. Their rice on sushi was dry and the rolls are small. Furthermore,we tried this fried spicy albacore roll that but it was awful. They even have the garlic albacore that I always order on any sushi place we went to but it was also a disappointment. The taste of the food is just off and I was not satisfied. 

They have poor service too because they take atleast 20-39mins to make your orders and give you the food. 

I will never consider this place again."}
{"text":"We come here at least once a week. We do AYCE  and it's an amazing deal! We have brought all our friends and family who swear that they don't like sushi and they all LOVE IT!! We get a lot of the appetizers the whole meal! We are sushi people and hunt out good sushi and since moving to Vegas this is out go-to spot!!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Walked in on a Saturday night and the place was quite busy which is understandable. There was no one working the register and no apparent hostess. There were plenty of seats at the sushi bar and my wife walked in to ask if we could sit there. Everyone looked confused and said to wait. We waited some more. No parties were seated as tables opened up. We would have been fine to wait if someone would have even acknowledged our presence. I refuse to pay someone for service that is so poor and I will not return."}
{"text":"Food excellent,  waitress very attentive and friendly,  great portions, prices reasonable - we were first-time patrons.   Definitely will be back.  Must try the Yuzu Sake Aladdin bottle, very refreshing!"}
{"text":"Food is outstanding. The staff is amazing and there is a busser named Wei that has the best customer service!"}
{"text":"I was looking for an AYCE sushi in Henderson. So glad I found this place. The sushi was fresh, the decor was very pleasant but the best thing about Kaizen was the service. Our waitress was very attentive, helpful and super pleasant. She went above and beyond. I was there with my friend and when we asked for the check we didn't even have to ask for separate checks. She already knew... And brought two separate checks. Now that's impressive!  I will definitely be back here. With so many sushi restaurants in the valley, Kaizen definitely stands out from the crowd!"}
{"text":"I usually yelp only when I like a place but ii realized that's not why they created this thing lol my friend and I wanted to try a new sushi place, somewhere we've never been and we've been to a lot...and I'm glad we tried kaizen but I don't plan on going back :( 
#1 fish was not fresh #2 I felt so rushed one of the guys kept coming to our table to see if we were done so he could clear the table.  #3 felt like our waitress was inconvenienced Everytime we wanted to order or ask for a refill etc.. The one thing I will commend is one of the rolls the waitress recommended was the silver state roll. Now that would be the only reason I would go back...but if you're looking for fresh fish nigiri style Go to Sushi Koma!"}
{"text":"Recently visited this restaurant after a year and I'm highly disappointed after my visit. The floors were absolutely filthy at the table i was seated at it was like the busser just cleaned the top and forgot to sweep the floor. It was all types of food under my table which was gross. Then it was like the staff was rushing us to make an order. And once we did order it took over 25 minuets for them to bring the food out. No one really checked on us during our time there. I could see if the restaurant was very busy but they were not. I'm not sure if I'll go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Overall a very tasty meal!  The Beef Udon soup was wonderful. The Pork Belly was amazing. The sushi roll was way to big. Could not eat it in one bite which makes you loose all the flavors... and it falls apart... this took it down from a five for us..."}
{"text":"This is the Henderson location I always go to the location off of Harmon but they're both equally as good. The all you can eat I guess is a good deal if you can eat a lot but I can't so it wasn't worth it for me. But I will definitely be back everything tasted so good!!

Update. 10-22 
Yes all you can eat dinner $28- and this time I went starving!! So all u can eat was worth it!!"}
{"text":"This place is great over all, the music that they play on mondays is great and I always go on a monday because its not as busy so u get extra attention from the chefs jason,ryan and geo the server. The whole restaurant including the staff is great, nice cool spot to go relax and have a few drinks with their 2 for 1 speacial with a little sushi of course. Jason has been doing a great job everytime I go specially when it comes to specials, they will make you anything you like since they said their policy is just to make everybody happy. I love this place and I highly recomended."}
{"text":"The service here is kind of ehhhh.  Almost everytime we come here they forget to bring at least one item, or bring food before our appetizers.  The food though is really good.  They have a great selection of rolls, and happy hour specials.  We will keep going back, but we will keep our guard up"}
{"text":"The family n I went out to Kaizen  this evening. The folks were super nice n the sushi was good, except the bacon wrapped undercooked, but nothing outstanding. We'll. Come back sometime for the all U can eat is worth it if ur hungry."}
{"text":"All you can eat for $20 bucks so you can't go wrong. The food is delious and you can also have some other food that's included with the all you can eat. The staff is very nice and I always enjoy eating here."}
{"text":"The sushi here is just so good! I love the Salmon Killer Roll! A great mix of spicy and fresh. Love the kpop playing in the background! Makes it a light atmosphere. Also, try their Creamy Shrimp! There's a lot of variety in their rolls. However, if I had to complain about one thing, it would be that the service is a bit too slow at times. Other than this, I believe this is a great spot in town to get sushi."}
{"text":"We were adamant in trying Kaizen just because my boyfriend said that the last time he was there, there was no AYCE & it wasn't even good. But that was in 2011. We discovered that they DO have AYCE now & they won Best of Las Vegas 2013? Well, based on the big poster outside.

So we decided to try it out for lunch on a Monday. We walked in to silence; we were the only ones! Not a good sign. Then once we sat, people started coming in. There was only one server. He wasn't the friendliest or anything but was accommodating, nonetheless.

Now the food.. DELICIOUS! Wth, why did we stray away from this place? Kinda kicked ourselves for trying it out so late but better late than ever. Idk about the mediocre reviews here but I loved the food. The AYCE selection is soooo extensive, compared to other places I've been too. I have a little attraction to restaurants with organized menus and this place does so that's a plus!

They have everything from Garlic Edemame to Takoyaki to Deep Fried Banana Sushi to Pork Belly to Tempura Cheesecake. Everything we ate were SO DELICIOUS. Sushi was cold when it was supposed to be cold & hot entrees were hot. 

YOU need to try it! For sure!"}
{"text":"My sister and I decided to try something new instead of our favorite sushi spot in town. We were very pleased with the food and menu at Kaizen! Their menu is much more diverse than what you can find online and the AYCE is such a good deal there. I want to give it 5 stars, but the service was no very attentive and slow. Very polite and professional! Just not at the level of our favorite place."}
{"text":"Very good...especially for north Las Vegas...Been there many times...Help seems professional!"}
{"text":"The quality of sushi at Kaizen is superior to others in town. This restaraunt has a fun and friendly atmosphere. TVs are located on all sides of sushi bar with large projection screen on the end. The projector screen shuffles music videos that features a wide range of popular hit music while the televisions play any relevant entertainment or sporting event.

The staff is another reason to choose Kaizen. Jay Kim and his staff have always worked hard while remaining polite, courteous, friendly and fun. It's apparent that others have chosen Kaizen as there designated sushi stop. Guests who walk in always appear excited upon their greeting."}
{"text":"I came here a couple times and I was not that impressed with their food. However, the service was pretty good. The restaurant is located in the far left corner of the Smith's shopping center and might be hard to find. The inside is nicely decorated, quite spacious and clean. They do both a la carte and all you can eat here. I have never tried their AYCE menu but I've had several items on their a la carte menu. The ramen and sushi here are quite underwhelming but their salads and bento boxes are on point. All in all, I would come back for their lunch menu but I wouldn't go here for AYCE Sushi."}
{"text":"This is me and my wife's favorite sushi place in Vegas!  The baked mussels are delicious!  My favorite roll is the Aliante Roll.  I eat two of those and I'm good!"}
{"text":"Friends took me here for New Years Lunch.....When are we coming back?
Sampled various Sushi plates ordered half orders so i can sample more.
The seaweed Salad is Bomb I had to order twice......good menu to choose from from all kinds of different sushi......they even have a kids menu to choose from."}
{"text":"This place is vedy vedy good. Like..  the kanye of sushi. Well maybe not kanye.. but this place is good. The poke is my favorite out of all the other sushi spots. The Silverstate roll is really good too. And you know what? They refill waters good!!!! Basically kaizen to the other sushi places is like goku vs vegeta.. or gohan vs cell..."}
{"text":"Always love coming to this place! Best in North Las Vegas! Always the best service, and quick!"}
{"text":"First time coming here and I must say, I'm very impressed. Even though they were busy, we had pretty good service. But the real magic comes from the kitchen. Every one knows there is nothing worse than bad sushi. This was phenomenal. Fresh and every roll was very well put together and tasted amazing. Very fairly priced! Plus with all you can eat (including soup and dessert) I think I've found my new favorite restaurant in Henderson!"}
{"text":"Sushi is okay, I've had better. What upsets me is the way the server treated me and my family. I'm here with my husband and son and she kept repeating to us that we need to make sure we don't share with our son because he is ordering from the regular menu. She said it 3 times before we even ordered and again after she took our order! Are you serious!! Treating us like criminals before we even ordered our meal. Will never come back or recommend this place! You can't treat customers that way! Shame on you. Damn Asian people! I can say that, I'm Asian!!"}
{"text":"This is MUST GO PLACE!!!! 
This is probably my favorite sushi house in Vegas.Nigiri sushi and rolls were delicious. If you  are going to splurge, this is the place to do it. You won't regret it!!! Their services were fabulous. kaizen manager guided us to a new sushi world. We've tried many great sushi that you could easily miss it in AYCE.

If you are looking for a great AYCE sushi place, I recommend this place. GREAT FOOD and SERVICE.

Go get'em fellow yelpers!"}
{"text":"While I was living in Vegas, I went to Kaizen regularly.

Very neat & clean. Waitering service is good.

I've always had their steak since I'm not much a sushi eater. Their steak is sooo delicious. Very tender and tons of flavor. My husband loves all of their rolls. I highly recommend kaizen whether you like sushi or not. There's something on their menu for everyone!"}
{"text":"Only giving this place 2 stars because they offered everything my husband likes...super white tuna on like every freaking roll! Ha.

It was our first and would be the last time there. We sat in the dark corner with our hungry kids. They waited a long time just to bring out their kids meals. We all started eating and saw there was HAIRS in the shrimp tempuras. Like you could see them clearly sticking out. All they could do is say SORRY? Not even a \"I'll replace your food for you\"...definitely not worth the $100 we spent, slow service and the rolls weren't even good."}
{"text":"worst place worst service thumbs down b rated crap sushi do not recommend!!! stay away!! horrible!!! if i could give negative stars i would!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Henderson sushi place so far. We just loved to town and have tried several sushi places. Lots of good choices, but will rate Kaisen the best to date. The Missus and I bellied up to the sushi bar and after some soul searching, we elected the AYCE offering She usually doesn't do AYCE because she is a light eater, but this time I think she got her money's worth. Dishes that were a hit were the hamachi, the pork belly(!), and every roll we ordered was great.  Monkey Brain was a fun taste. AYCE price was reasonable and the service was prompt and friendly. Struck up a good conversation with a couple that were regulars. Kaiser seems to have a loyal following. We may be joining the fan club"}
{"text":"All around horrible experience. They have a 90 minute all you can eat time limit and I saw my waitress once in the first 75 minutes and all she said was, \"You guys good?\" She was nowhere to be found after that until she came to collect her auto gratuity which pissed me off to pay. Thankfully one of the bussers with tattoos came to take my order after he saw my whole table of 7 looking for someone. He earned these 2 stars and if I could give a 5 out of 5 for his service only I would. Also, I finished my soda in the first 20 minutes of being there and not once did someone ask if I wanted a refill, or even came up to see if I needed anything, or more to drink. LAST BUT NOT LEAST, I pulled a 9 inch piece of hair out of my mouth, it tickled my throat and I pulled it through my two middle teeth as if I was flossing. I will never be returning to this horrible place. And I urge you, if you want All you can eat, go somewhere where you can talk to your waitress and actually order your food so you can do what you planned on doing in the first place, EAT!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time about a week ago with my friends. I had the crab rolls and miso soup. The food was delicious! My only issue was that none of the staff came over to check on us at all. Once we sat down, they got our orders, then they brought out orders, and that was it. We kept trying to get someone's attention so we could get the check, but everyone walked right past us. Other than that, the staff was sweet when we did talk. The place is very comfortable and modern."}
{"text":"If you love all you can eat sushi, this is the place for you! Their sushi is fresh and delicious. Their Kiss of Fire roll is my favorite. It has great flavor and a little bit of spiciness. Also, if you're not a fan of sushi, they have some great entrees as well. I enjoy their chicken curry udon. They also have amazing desserts--fried cheesecake, mochi ice cream, and tempura green tea ice cream (my favorite). Definitely come to this restaurant on an empty stomach! You'll want all the room you can possibly have! Also, make reservations, especially if coming with a group. There is often a long line. 

This is a great place for getting a group of people together. Every time I go, it's with a group of about 7-10 people. We make reservations beforehand and most of us order the all you can eat sushi. The service is good and is able to handle the large group."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, relax, and have fun. Our waiter who's name is pronounced ''WAY\" and as he'll remind you: ''It's his way or the highway\" - I swear 

Go there, it's worth it - and take it from me, prices are most reasonable 

Caite & Danny


P.S. Next visit I'm going to ask him if you heat eel in an electric oven does that make it an electric eel?"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and have been through the multiple management/owner changes. I love their all you can eat menu. Not a fan of the fact that you get charged for what you don't finish. The music doesn't match the vibe, but it's accessible for a quick dinner before the movies, it's near Nellis and Aliante is down the street, literally."}
{"text":"Best A.Y.C.E sushi in Las Vegas. It is $22 for lunch 11:30am-4pm and $27 for dinner 4-close. The employees are efficient and very helpful. It can get busy at night but they make sure to get you in as soon as possible. Highly suggest trying the  \"Hungry Roll\" and \" Sex bomb\" roll."}
{"text":"Kinda slipping away from the other AYCE places I liked for several reasons (ex. distance from home), which allowed the fiance to take me out of my comfort zone. He had assured me that this place was good from his past experiences, and he was right. I enjoyed the food. Our hostess was extremely nice and also acted as a waitress, helping the other wait staff check on us during our meal. I do have to agree with others that once it got busier around dinner rush, staff visits were less frequent. 
Going back to the food, it was good quality for the most part. I think my least favorite item was a roll with scallops and mushrooms - sorry, but it was kinda soupy with sauce. My absolute favorite though was the Crazy Boy! Hahaha... I like deep fried rolls! Drinks were also decent."}
{"text":"The service and staff aren't exactly the best. Slow service, rude staff. But the food and AYCE setup keep me coming back."}
{"text":"The best AYCE sushi in town, hands down. I've tried many places but nothing compares to Kaizen. We've been coming to this place for several years and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"This is my Favorite place to come for all you can eat sushi. Nice atmosphere and always busy. Crazy girl roll, crispy soft shell crap and green tea Tempura ice cream are my favorite things to get, soooo good."}
{"text":"Love this place. The sushi is always on point. I only gave 4 stars because even though I eat here frequently, you never know how the service will be."}
{"text":"Really liked the sushi. Fresh, nice variety and you can do half rolls. Only downside to the place is that it's a little small so on busy nights you will have to wait a little just like any other place."}
{"text":"Been to several AYCE sushi restaurant locations across the Valley and this place has repeatedly gotten better and better.  Very good, very fresh and a comfortable atmosphere.  Staff is friendly and always happy you came (compared to some other establishments,  unfortunately). The menu is fairly diverse and gives you just enough choices. Try the Rockn'Roll, fresh and delicious!  Convenient location just minutes off the 215 and Eastern, worth the time and depending how busy, the wait."}
{"text":"If you're up in the Northwest of Las Vegas and craving all you can eat sushi, I recommend Kaizen. If you're hungry, don't even bother looking for individual rolls, just get the all you can eat.. and order everything! I always leave there satisfied, and still wanting more!"}
{"text":"Great service and quality of food every time we come in. We come here on a regular basis and continually receive the same great service. Lots of variety on the menu as well as half roll options. All you can eat also includes some sashimi."}
{"text":"Nothing like stopping by for an 80 dollar lunch and getting ignored in a 3/4 empty restaurant. Horrific operations"}
{"text":"This is for sure one of my favorite sushi places I have tried in Henderson. Being a big salmon eater cleanliness and freshness is always very key for me, and I have never had a problem with either one of those things in my many of times that I have been to this establishment. I believe the prices are fair not crazy expensive but not cheap. ( you pay for what you get) Staff has always been friendly and food is prepared quickly. I would recommend this place to any sushi lovers."}
{"text":"Visited here with a group from work as it's close to the Palms where we were staying. Very cool interior with a massive projection tv screen showing some crazy music videos.

First thing I noticed was the huge variety on the menu. Great selection of sake plus just about every different type of roll you could possibly want. We ordered a bunch of different rolls for the group and stuffed ourselves silly.

Favorite dish - the ahi tuna appetizer on wonton crackers. Had a baked salmon roll which was also delicious. Will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. The food wasn't that great. The fried foods came out cold somehow. Ended up waiting 20 minutes without anyone checking on us so I had to flag someone down just to get the check even though we were still waiting for some food we ordered when we first came in. Apparently they don't even have a manager on duty you can speak to."}
{"text":"Good food, good service on a night where a lot of local businesses lost power due to a thunderstorm. Only disappointment in all the items we ordered off the AYCE menu was the soft shell crab appetizer as it had no meat in the crab - was all just fried shell. And uni didn't look fresh (dark brown) but tasted ok. Raw shrimp also looked old in color & tasted funky. Loved the Rock N Roll Roll as well as the Sex Bomb roll."}
{"text":"Ate here with a group of friends and food was pretty good. After more people arrived at the restaurant, the service started to slow, but the staff was still really nice. I definitely recommend this place as a sushi joint."}
{"text":"Was heading home after a function during the late night hours and was craving sushi.  A review of the yelp app brought me to KFR&S because they were open until 2:00AM.  Friendly service with delicious food.  When in need of a late night sushi fix or pe hang over cure give Kaizen a shot."}
{"text":"I tried this place a few weeks ago and the service and food was excellent! Will be returning back there A.S.A.P :D"}
{"text":"They added a sushi/salad bar along with their all you can eat.  My family comes all the time.  The service is not bad and the food is great.  Get the oysters...

Got food poisoning, lasted almost a week..."}
{"text":"Let me tell you what, thought I was going to enjoy a quite dinner with my friend. We get there and it takes them 45 minutes to seat us. Then an additional 45 minutes to eat. All I'm saying, is that customer service is lacking severely."}
{"text":"Did not care for the sushi nor the salmon entree.. my husband said the sushi tasted old and bland and my salmon dinner was fatty and tasteless as well."}
{"text":"Had the bacon wrapped scallops and the poke bowl ordered through uber eats and it was delicious thanks will definitely order again also I'm a truck driver at knight transportation if you guys could send us some menus a lot of guys would like to order.  Thanks again"}
{"text":"My second home is Kaizen. Great food, and entertainment with their music video's playing on the large flat screen tv!"}
{"text":"I am all for ayce sushi and although I have eaten here a couple of times with my friends, I always just got entrees. Today I tried their all you can eat sushi with my man and learned that I will just stick to entrees.

Service was amazing. People always checked on us constantly. Really friendly people and apologized for the wait. 

Food was also amazing. Try the oysters! Their sushi tasted as good as any ayce sushi spot and they even offer 2 for 1 drinks late night with it (9pm-12am I think). 

Wait time was what made the experience yucky and truly unpleasant. Not the seating wait time but for your actual food to come out, IF it comes out. It is understandable for us that it is busy and maybe a 30 minute wait for the minimal amount of sushi that we ordered is still ok. We were there for 2 HOURS and barely got most of the sushi we ordered as the restaurant started getting less busy. We've even asked our servers if our food was coming or not and still the things we ordered again did not come the entire time we were there.

For $27, I could easily recommend another local sushi spot for a better experience for the same service and food quality."}
{"text":"It was my first time there last night with a party of 12. The sushi was alright. It was lacking in taste. Most of the rolls didn't have too much rice. They're probably skimping on rice to save it. The service was lacking. We ordered the 1st round and it took around 25 minutes to get our food. We decided to order the 2nd round while still waiting for the 1st round of food because we didn't want to keep waiting so long and the waiter asks \"You want to order dessert now?\" Umm...hello! We haven't even gotten our 1st round of orders and you want to take our dessert order? They even forgot two of my orders. I don't think I'll be back. Next!"}
{"text":"It would've got 5 stars except for the fact it took 20-30 minutes to get anything we ordered and lucky if we got what we ordered at that. When you only have 1 1/2 hour limit you're not getting too much. I love the food but the one on the north side was much much faster with food and service!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with friendly staff.  Sushi was fresh and tasted great! Salsa Dancing Roll was awesome! Overall will be coming back"}
{"text":"The sushi here is tasty. There is a large selection of baked rolls for those who insist on sushi, but dislike raw fish. Their nigiri is fresh and cuts of fish generous. Their AYCE is around $27, the menu is pretty extensive and it is higher quality of sushi. My favorite rolls were Kiss of Fire and Silver State.

Why only 2 stars? 

There were several rolls we ordered, as well as an order of uni that never made it out. In fact, in the middle of our service, they stopped coming to take our order altogether. There were four of us, all indulging in AYCE. When the server came by, he mentioned that the chefs were backed up. The restaurant wasn't even half full. This is where the greedy part comes in. They purposefully spaced it so that we would eventually just get tired or decide we are full and leave. To be fair, they did comp our drinks ($7.50) due to the wait without us asking. But that hardly makes up for not getting several rolls we ordered, yet signed for a $120 bill. Also, the ladies' bathroom toilet didn't flush. Big yuck!

On the next visit, boyfriend's brother's fiance asked me to go back with her. I did, and the greedy part was reaffirmed and I am most definitely not coming back. I initially didn't think I'd have much food so I didn't opt for AYCE... I ordered a cucumber salad and two rolls (not realizing that I was close to $35 already). Now, I had done something similar at another sushi joint, where I just ordered what I remembered I enjoyed as AYCE as a la carte, and then had the waitress suggest that I should just go AYCE because what I ordered was well over the AYCE price. I appreciated that type of service and looking out for the customer instead of pocketing extra $20 and losing 5+ repeat customers. 
Oh, yeah, they also forgot one of my rolls and we just sat around while they brought it out. Apparently the chefs thought they had already filled that order. The sheer greediness this place exhibited left  a horrible impression. I am not asking for freebies, but I also will not be taken advantage of. Their lack of customer focus cost them 5 certain repeat customers, and probably many more people I would have brought there, because the sushi is actually pretty good.

It is located in the Buffalo Wild Wings parking lot on Eastern. The parking on weekends is a nightmare."}
{"text":"Good was great! All you can eat sushi was worth it. Why 4 stars? the item that we had to wait for was mochi ice cream...  everything else was coming out rather quickly."}
{"text":"In an effort to try all sushi places around our house we only 2 left to go. Last night it was Kaizen time, and now we have one left (Sushi Wa). So....I gotta say, we really liked this place. The menu is a little out of the ordinary in that all of the specials not only describe the item, but also have a picture of it right there. Slick. The place itself is nice, not real big but a decent size. The decor is not overdone and is clean. Very nice.  Prices, like all sushi places (to me) are high, but no higher than anywhere else I suppose. The variety of rolls is good---does not go on and on as some do, but plenty of choices. We got mostly special type rolls and a couple of non-specials. The rolls themselves were great, really well presented and tasty. Some of the best I have had anywhere. I would go back in a heartbeat, and will. A definate new favorite."}
{"text":"I eat here several times but I can not recommend ordering for delivery or pick up. Sauces are never marked and they never pick up their phone if you need to contact them.   I called another location to see if this is consistent and it seems to be just this location. Answer your phone and if You offer delivery, provide excellent service as well on all facets."}
{"text":"NEVER COME HERE ! I always have a problem here. They aren't clean and my waiter was a bitch. I was here for 2 hours and was only served 3 times , mind you I had all you can eat . I was still hungry when I left. How the hell does that work ? Tried to explain my issue, the waiter walked off and started serving another table. When I asked for a manager they told their wasn't one there. Don't be surprise if you get sick. Stay away ! Food and customer service here fucking sucks !! I will be reporting them to B.B."}
{"text":"I have visited this location a handful of times and normally the service is good, but upon my last visit I was left thoroughly disappointed. It was the first time I went on a Saturday while it was busy (around 8pm). The presentation of the two baked salmon orders I placed were sloppy and the rice was burned on the bottom of  both as well. I ordered baked mussels and what I received was cold. I also ordered the fatty tuna and it was served to me with an eyelash on it. The waitresses were nice but not very attentive. Unfortunately, this place is only good if they are not busy. If you do decide to eat here then just be aware of the time you go in to dine."}
{"text":"I really hate giving this place two stars.  Let me start by saying that the food is really good.  The problem with this place is service.  Our first experience was on a busy Friday night.  We chose to sit at the sushi bar, and only because the sushi chef would personally hand our items to us and then ask if we wanted anything else, was the service acceptable.  The young lady who was serving us was very friendly, but by the looks of things, the restaurant was understaffed.  We did the all you can eat (AYCE) program at dinner and the value is worth it as it basically includes almost everything on their menu.   

Then we decided to visit yesterday (Memorial Day) at 12:45.  The restaurant was moderately busy with several open tables and over the half the sushi bar seats open.  We were quickly seated at a table- and then it began. Or I should say it didn't.  My husband and son got the AYCE and I ordered a lunch special.  They delivered drinks right a way, and soups for me and my son.  The rest of the experience was a DISASTER.  One appetizer took 45 minutes - for THREE TEMPURA SHRIMP???  My lunch special came out on its own - and so I sat there WAITING for the rolls my husband and son ordered.  Literally 10 minutes later they brought one roll each.  Then over the course of the next 35 minutes they brought my sons other rolls (2) - but never my husbands.  So, in over one hour - my husband had one roll and three tempura shrimp.  We complained to the waitress - who kept switching out with another girl - and she said \"I know -we hate it too - but you ordered cooked food'.  REALLY - my husband had a salmon roll that was tempura on the inside.  It takes 1 hr 20 minutes to cook tempura????  The table next to us was on the same slow train -but interestingly enough other tables were being served on a faster pace. We even had put in two rolls at a time (based on a previous experience) and it didn't matter.  The girl delivering the food was not our waitress so she would just say what it was - with no clue who it was for (which is a little confusing for us at the table trying to remember all the names of the rolls and who ordered what).  Then some guy not even dressed in uniform dropped a roll - and we asked what it was- and his reply was \"I DONT KNOW- THEY JUST TOLD ME IT GOES HERE\".  It was  NIGHTMARE.  My husband and son eventually ordered dessert, and after they ate it - the waitress came by our table and asked if the roll order she had in her hand was for us - REALLY?  Come on - get it together.

We couldn't even get the waitress to come back to bring us the check!  My husband had to go up to the front to get it. 

I wish I could blame it on being busy. The woman at the register said this was the busiest Memorial Day they had in three years.  They definitely needed more wait staff and probably at least one more sushi chef.  We noticed by the time we left it seemed like they had called people in to work.  But it was the same bad service on a busy Friday night as it was on a medium busy Monday afternoon.

Again, the food is very good - but there is NO management on the floor (or apparent) and they seemingly are running understaffed which doesnt lead to a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Best ayce I've had in awhile! It was really good! So much to choose from. Definitely coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town, we just wanted something quick to take back to the in-laws. Sushi sounded the best, so I ordered six rolls for pick up through the yelp app. Everything went smooth with the transaction. The sushi was packaged well and included all the sauces and condiments along with chopsticks. All the rolls were very good. My favorite was the Rattlesnake with shrimp tempura and eel."}
{"text":"This place is my go to when I come back to visit vegas. When I lived here I can maybe 1-2 times a month. 

The food is always hands down amazing! 
I love the sauce on the orange blossom and swear by the ice cream in your mouth roll for dessert. 

Service is always prompt and prices are fair. I wish there was a location here in Texas!"}
{"text":"After a few more visits, I think Kaizen deserves a bump up to 5 stars!

Consistently good service, helpful and friendly sushi chefs, and most importantly, they served me amazingly delicious live Uni AND they have fresh wasabi. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kaizen-fusion-roll-and-sushi-henderson-3?select=5wwkK5J3s0zJwPL_OAIOLg#TuJ6XKrUJZWgLcCvfayp1Q

Plus, they always bring out my son's cute kid's meal out ASAP, which is awesome. All these things makes me want to come eat here even more!"}
{"text":"Absolutely THE best AYCE sushi place I have ever been too, I have tried countless places all around vegas and this place is the best. The AYCE menu is three pages long, back and front and there service is very fast. It gets very busy and they get large groups that come in that do the AYCE sushi and they do a pretty good job keeping up with everyones orders, occasionally they will forget a roll or two but my group never really cares much. They are very nice and friendly and the food is very fresh and delicious. I recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"My 2nd favorite sushi restaurant in Henderson... Great quality, great pricing, great staff, great atmosphere.  Yes, please :)"}
{"text":"This place is fresh and friendly and always delivers bomb food and we never leave disappointed. They cater to my boyfriends dietary restrictions and the service is great."}
{"text":"Love love love Kaisen!  Sushi and service is always spot on!  Yummy!!!! 
You can't beat The all you can eat sushi anywhere.....the girls and guys are awesome and always help with smiles and great service!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I love that you can order half rolls! I usually just have one or two rolls but with the option of halfs, I can have a taste of a little bit of everything!"}
{"text":"I think that this might be the best AYCE sushi restaurant in Las Vegas/Henderson. The food is very good, specially the variety of nigiri that offer. It is also one of the rare restaurant that offers Toro nigiri. Serivce needs a bit improvement, but its the food that counts at any restaurant. 

Sushi rolls are also amazing, I would recommend Avocado Train for starters. I can't wait to go here again."}
{"text":"This is an awesome all you can eat sushi place in North Vegas. Coming from Pennsylvania you don't get stuff like this out there. a must try for tourists and locals alike i support this place. Kaizen also has a great music choice with their songs. All the sushi is top notch as well and i wasn't disappointed when i tried others sushi."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars - actually one of the better AYCE places here in Vegas especially in Silverado Ranch/Seven Hills area. This place satisfied my sushi cravings. 

Waitress recommended to try their \"orange blossom\" and \"sex bomb\" rolls - they were actually very good ! They do half rolls here too which is always a plus. Salmon & salmon belly nigiri were delicious. Toro & uni nigiri were actually decent for being an AYCE place. Only thing I wish that was better  is their fish-to-rice ratio but at least the sushi tasted fresh.

Sashimi is limited to 3 orders per person I believe but it's more than enough so you have room for other things. I highly recommend their salmon sashimi as well as their yellowtail sashimi.

Other menu items I've enjoyed were their beef tataki (1 order per person) and soft shell crab. Unlimited dessert (honey toast , tiramisu , tempura cheesecake and your standard mochi & tempura ice cream are all available here). Only dessert that is not unlimited is the creme brulee which comes in green tea or vanilla.

Appreciated good customer service from all the waitresses here. Prices are 23$ lunch (til 4 pm) & 28$ dinner. Make sure to get their stamp card (11th one is free)."}
{"text":"My mom raves about Kaizen so I came to try it out today. The service is wonderful and fast. Sae was our server and answered all my questions about the rolls since I had no clue what to order!! I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"You can't beat the price and the wide choices from the menu for the AYCE!!! I love all the appetizers and salad options. The poke salad is amazing, and my favorite roll hands down is the Monster. It's nice that they give you the option to order half rolls, so you don't get too full from few orders. The service can be a little all over the place, but the staff are always super friendly. We keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Went there for ladies night. Beautiful atmosphere. Serving time was longer than I expected. I tried my first AYCE in las vegas at this location, so I don't know it's common to feel this way or not.

We all enjoyed our time chatting with food and drinks. But serving/checking on us time was bit long than I expected. When we need their attentions, I could see only the usher who cleans other tables and not having proper knowledge on their menus.

We went to maguro sushis for 2-3 rounds. We were 3 but served only 2 pieces. So when only 2 eels, 2 salmons, 2 of other matures then 1 person couldn't taste that. Wish they could know it's better to be served as the count of the people on the table when it comes to AYCE.

Clean, Nice atmosphere, good selections even we tried mostly only maguro ones."}
{"text":"This is my first time at an All You Can Eat joint...

.and it will be my last.

We sat, and at first, the wait staff was all around us. We were asked by 3 different  people for drinks....and then they all disappeared. We hunted down one gal, and ordered. Because alot of the items are 1 order per person... like oysters,  we both ordered the items.

The rolls were just okay. The best one we had was.... i like my ass, or something  to that effect.  It was fresh, and had a decent  amount of flavor. 

Other than that the bacon wrapped shrimp, and the SINGLE order of oysters we received ...everything  just tasted like mush. 

Even with fish just over the rice, the rice was so soft, you can't  even pick it up with your chopsticks without the rice breaking in half, and then falling all over the yable, and plate.

Whenever  we would ask for our second order of things... like our oysters  (which were fucking raw, btw, they didnt have to cook). We were told to just wait and that they were coming....they never did.

So, we just waited, like we were told, and 20 or so minutes  would go by...so we would ask  again...

\"Just wait.\"

Ohhkaaay.

Asked for the check  twice. 
Paid, signed and left the slip on the table.

My family  and i are then chased  out to our SUV like we're criminals, by a guy telling us that he needed my signature copy. That i took all the papers.

Well, yes, theres your copy, and then theres MY copy for my records.  Look on the table before  you come running  out to us.


Lack luster  food, rude service,  and forgotten  items. 

Thanks but no thanks"}
{"text":"GARBAGE!

Don't try to place a phone order, they don't speak English-no seriously they don't speak English!!!!!  Their customer service was horrible, rushed, and rude. The food was basically thrown onto our table and then the server ran away.  It's also overpriced and quality is very low and poorly made.

Avoid it....."}
{"text":"***LIVE-YELPING***

Just for the fun of it, and because this is my first time attempting an All-You-Can-Eat sushi experience, I'm going to \"live-tweet\" this meal. I'll preface my opinions by declaring loud and proud that I am a total sushi novice. So, if you dream of sushi like Jiro, and you're not a total newbie like me, please take my words with a grain of salt. 

That being said, if you think that California rolls are a brave choice (like I do), I hope my opinions help you branch out and try something new!

Here goes nothin...

** Egg rolls - so yummy! They came to the table super hot, and cut into halves. Crunchy and tender. Love the tangy sauce. 
** Pork belly - nice, super flavorful and tender. We ordered this three times! 
** Potstickers - deep fried and yummy! The sauce was a bit plain... try dunking in the egg roll sauce instead. ;)
** Monkey roll - spicy! The avocado is lovely, and being deep fried is awesome. The spicy mayo that they give you to dip is so tasty! I asked for an extra side of it!
** California roll - classic (aka vanilla) sushi fare, and it made me so very happy. I thought the roll was thicker than I've had in the past. 
** Hungry roll - also deep fried, also with spicy tuna... So really, how can you go wrong?
** BBQ roll - not my favorite. Hard to chew! Plus, the amount of meat was small. 
** Crunch roll - how fun! Love those little chrunchies. And the tempura shrimp! 
** Monster roll - fried onions!? What! It looks like a monster! Unanimously the favorite at our table. 
** Crazy girl roll - second favorite. Looks crazy, tastes fabulous. We ordered it twice! I love how the look of this roll totally matches the name. The cream cheese is a nice treat. And being deep fried certainly doesn't hurt things. With the crab on top, it tastes almost like a crab rangoon.
** Chicken skewer with scallion - the perfect anecdote to all the cold food that came before. Crispy and hot and yum!
** Tempura ice cream - thick tempura, my favorite. Vanilla ice cream was simple and sweet, and exactly what I needed to finish up such an indulgent meal.  

Well, that's a wrap. I'm stuffed!

All in all, I really enjoyed the meal. I was proud of myself for branching out beyond my usual California roll, and so happy that my bravery was rewarded with such a great experience. The food was tasty, and the service was attentive. I'll definitely be back... and next time, I hope to be even braver. ;)"}
{"text":"Waited at the entrance for more than 10 minutes without any acknowledgement. Every employee avoided eye contact. Very unwelcoming.First and last visit"}
{"text":"I had always loved Kaizen for the quality of the sushi they serve. So fresh and authentic, you feel like you're swimming in the oceans with them. But my only issue was that they were never AYCE, until they finally did the unthinkable.

Kaizen has very a very moden type of decor and appearance with multiple TVs and even a projector screen that plays random music videos. It's hardly packed when I go so the environment is acceptable and comfortable.

Kaizen has always served the best rolls and sushi in town. You can say all you want about Goyemon and what not but I personally don't think  you can compare the two. My BELOVED roll is the sexy roll. The food itself defines its title in every way whether it be from taste to looks. The spicy tuna was thicker than the rice and the sauce that it was pressed on had my tongue slobbering. And as you order more and more, the chefs put less rice and sushi on your rolls so that they can be easy on us too! There's also a salad bar for all the AYCE customers! It consists of seaweed salad, other typical salads, cucumbers, and etc. 

AYCE is about $27.95. It's a fraction more than the average but you are paying more for better quality. Otherwise, all the rolls are practically the same in terms of pricing.

Service is great! Although there was only one server, he was on top of everything all the time. 

I'm sorry Mon, Goyemon, and Yama, but there's a new sheriff in town. Everyone should give this place a try."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place ! The atmosphere is wonderful, great place for a girls night to grab dinner and catch up ! The best sushi in Henderson !! The garlic ahi tuna is my absolute favorite ! If you haven't tried this place you have to now !!"}
{"text":"Kaizen is one of those sushi places that you only go to when you're too lazy to drive to the other side of town. Or in my case, when my husband and all his friends choose where to eat. 

Sushi is good but their service is terrible. The employees lack customer service. Our server took so long to refill our drinks that I ended up drinking the water bottle that was in my purse. 

Also, they charge half price for little kids to eat if you're eating AYCE. I can understand paying half price for a 6 year old who is going to eat a substantial amount of food but my 3 year old isn't going to eat 3 sushi rolls... This is the only AYCE place that I've been to that charged for sharing with your little one. DUMB!"}
{"text":"Came to this all you can eat sushi from friend's recommendation. Sushi rolls are Ok and they're in a small portion which is good. Side dishes and grilled courses are not good at all, don't like their salads either...They don't have many options for sashimi's and we came for uni(sea urchin) but we have been told that they don't have uni for today :( We ordered iced green tea and hot tea but there were no flavor of \"green tea\"; we also ordered green tea ice cream and tempura cheese cake, but the green tea ice cream didn't taste \"green\" We got bad service too. There is a server almost throwing the plates to our table( we don't know if he is in a rush or the restaurant is too busy or whatever....), and the food were almost out of the plate and he didn't even say anything and treat that as normal!!! What a speechless experience First time, and the Last time too!"}
{"text":"Cool little place that's close to my house. I am a regular visitor and enjoy going there with my family. The service is usually fast and the wait staff is friendly for the most part although they sometimes seems irritated and annoyed. The all you can eat sushi for its price is pretty fair however would like to see a couple items brought back like the Korean short rib."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi joint in town. There are several sushi places to choose from in the area and some of them are even good; but my personal opinion this one is the best one and I always return."}
{"text":"The fish to rice ratio at kaizen is perfect. It's not overloaded with rice which most sushi restaurants do. Everything my boyfriend and I ordered was very delicious and fresh. Don't really have a complaint about the food at all but the customer service can be way better. 

This was our first time eating A.Y.C.E. At kaizen.. and well we just didn't feel welcomed at all. At first we thought they were short staffed so we didn't really think of it. We even felt bad for the girl who was our server because it looked like she had a lot of people sitting in her station. After awhile though the guy who sat us was taking orders in the same station. So seeing this we were hoping our server would have time to acknowledge us after dropping off our orders. But there was no how is everything going, or EVEN are you guys ready to order more clearly seeing our plates that were delivered has been cleared. WE ALWAYS HAD TO FLAG HER DOWN. And no we weren't even sitting in a back corner of the restaurant we were sitting right in the middle in front of the bar... There was one person on the other hand that actually made us feel welcomed, and it was the busser. He actually asked us how we were doing and how was everything tasting,every time he refilled our glasses or clearing our plates. Even when we were sitting there waiting for the check asked us if there wasn't anything else we would like. 

I would go back just for the sushi and this time just sit at the bar instead of the table if the service stays the same. Can't really knock off stars just because two people who actually had to deal with the customers had bad customer service towards us. So for the food itself I give this place 5 stars for the two servers who didn't bother to acknowledge us I give you guys a 3 just because when the girl did acknowledge us she was polite."}
{"text":"very slow service even when the whole restaurant was empty! What they said would take 10 minutes took 50. I got a free fortune kitty out of this yelp review so thanks for that!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Kaizen as a result of leaving another sushi place because it was overcrowded. Kaizen is definitely one of my new sushi spots as the rolls are good, the nigiri is fresh and they offer more dessert options. I do recommend the Orange Blossom Roll and the Snow White Roll. The mussels are good too. 

I found the service to be excellent and attentive. Since it was out first time there, our server was so kind he gave my friend (who didn't do the AYCE option) a complimentary Creme Brûlée! 

I will definitely be coming back. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The sushi is excellent here, however the service is poor. I was here for 90+ mins and spent at least 70 mins simply waiting for food. Not only that but I had to ask the waiter to take my order. Plus, when we were trying to get the bill we waiting next to the hosts podium for another 10 mins and it was very clear that I waiting for assistance and no one showed any kind of urgency to help me."}
{"text":"Always busy..which is a good sign of great food!! Friendly and patient staff. My only suggestion--stop for call in orders -- please expedite or have someone solely work this area of business. The wait time is horrible!!! Atmosphere is great and very upbeat."}
{"text":"Hands down best all you can eat sushi in the area. The fish quality is way above competitors around for basically the same price. check it out"}
{"text":"Love this place my go to sushi spot on the Southside of town. My husband loves the appetizers, the sushi is good. Staff is friendly and grabs empty plates right away."}
{"text":"Delicious AF! Best sushi place in Vegas! My favorite roll is the Japanese lasagna yum  Go here if you like sushi"}
{"text":"Brought my daughter for an after school dinner and we loved it. Sat at the sushi bar and had the AYCE, the guys were super fast! We went in right before a big dinner rush. Try the Ice Cream in Your Mouth roll!! Bomb!"}
{"text":"I don't really love sushi. But it was my friends birthday so I decided to try. Loved it. Great service-my friend was a pro at ordering ayce sushi. I followed her lead. Everything came so fast and fresh! I did try muscles for the first time-pretty good. I loved the tempura (not sushi ) sushi roll wise let's see the banana roll was really different- it was my favorite. But I also liked the baked salmon roll and chicken katsu roll. I can't do the raw stuff  I look forward to coming back- babies enjoyed their sushi too!"}
{"text":"Love the location, it's in a local area with lots to do. Restaurant is energetic. Service staff is fast paced. AYCE is a great deal. Most importantly, the food is good. Seafood is fresh. Would prefer this spot over the AYCE places closer to the Strip."}
{"text":"YAY SUSHI! I've been to the location on Paradise a number of times, but I had yet to visit this one (even though it's closer to home.) I placed an order for pick-up, which was waiting on a nearby table when I arrived. 

The inside of the restaurant looks exactly like the Paradise location, but about two or three times bigger. All of the food is excellent. I've brought people who have eaten sushi in Japan and people who have never tried sushi and so far, everyone has enjoyed the food at Kaizen. My BFF's fiance swore he hated sushi until he agreed to try a chicken teriyaki roll. Now he's hooked. That's what Kaizen does to people.

Although there aren't a ton of vegetarian rolls, the few they have are excellent. They offer a vegetable tempura roll and a shiitake mushroom tempura roll that are just to die for. 

The best part is definitely the dessert menu. They have green tea and red bean ice cream and FIVE types of mochi ice cream! 

Overall, great restaurant. I really like the variety on the menu, and the service is always good. Plus, it's open super late (like, 3 a.m.)"}
{"text":"We went to Kaizen last night and we were really disappointed. They changed their AYCE so that after a certain time they no longer offer AYCE and they only serve sushi a la carte. Also, I feel that they are severely short handed. The host was running around like a chicken with his head cut off, but the restaurant wasn't even that full. There was a waiting list, but there were several tables empty. He was very rude and once he said that they no longer served AYCE several people left. 

My husband and I ended up leaving as well and drove down the street to Sushi Tachi and when we got there, several customers that we saw at Kaizen were also there. We were all laughing when we recognized each other and all of us told the servers at Sushi Tachi about our experience at Kaizen and how we all ended up here. There were 4 groups waiting when we got to kaizen and 3 of the 4 groups plus us went to Tachi. That was a lot of missed business for Kaizen. What a shame. 

I gave two stars just because I remember past experience and the food was pretty good. However, if they keep the a la carte thing going I don't foresee us ever coming back to Kaizen. There really is no point, with all the great AYCE places in Vegas, they really don't have a leg to stand on. It's a shame that they will be losing so much business, it was great having a good sushi spot in NLV."}
{"text":"Kaizen sushi henderson is my must go sushi restaurant in town. It doesn't matter how far from my house. anytime I'm craving for sushi or I have guests, this place is the 1st place I take my people to. They have so many delicious appetizers, rolls, fresh sushi and sashimi. ummmm soooo yummmmmm~ . Oyster??? Oh my Gosh~don't even ask!!!
hey, yelpers!!!! check this place!! no regrets!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food as always. Issue has become it is just way too busy in here. Stopped by for a quick AYCE and ended up here nearly an hour. The guys behind the bar are non stop. Props to them for the speed and quality coming out, it just takes forever. Normally sitting at the bar you don't have to order in bulk but lately it's become the method. Great job chefs!"}
{"text":"THE WORST SUSHI EXPERIENCE EVER. I've been to alot of sushi places in Vegas but this is by far the worst. Took us almost 3 hrs for 2 rounds of sushi and food was not worth it. Don't waste your time or money here. I rarely ever leave yelp reviews but I couldn't let this go.."}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE sushi places in town. Wide selection of rolls and nigiri options. The selections were fresh and it's a great place if you have a large appetite."}
{"text":"Super! Great selection, they are very accommodating to modify rolls to be vegetarian.  Super huge salad is awesome and I appreciate that they let me choose my veggies I want in my tempura orders.  Once they mixed up my order but not only did tgey correct it, they let me keep and try the mix up! Great service."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night with a buddy after work. 
We were staying at a friend's house and he said this place is close but it's 'meh' and we were too tired to drive down to the place he rated 'oooh'

For a Friday night we found the best parking spot, right smack in front of the door, not a good sign i think to myself. The interior is nicely decorated, simple but nothing distracting you from the 'eat and get out' attitude of restaurants.

Service was very friendly, or i was a bit drunk i forgot...

The food was nice and fast, flagging down a server could be a little slow but when you put your order in it came with priority. A few points of interest:

1) VERY fresh - I usually avoid sashimi because i dont like the texture but something about the sashimi here made it VERY enjoyable to eat

2) Kaizen Scallop Dynamite - located in the hot appetizer section. includes little scallops in a sauce that i want poured over my breakfast cereal with a crust of cheese on top. If you're going to get this order a bowl of rice and a spoon on the side

3) Broiled Yellowtail Collar - Didnt taste very fresh to begin with, was dry from over broiling. 

A bit on the pricey side but i wouldn't mind coming back again next time i'm in this part of town."}
{"text":"First I have to say in the capitol of AYCE sushi this place has some of the best appetizers, and small plates anywhere. If any place has my beloved shishito peppers I am a happy girl.
Ambiance is bright, fun and immaculate. they have music videos as well as sports on multiple tv's, but the room never gets loud or annoying. 
Service is great. Even when they are swamped they make sure every single guest is happy and attended to. One of the GM's even hopped behind the sushi bar to assist me on his night off! I ale saw the owner running food for the kitchen, talk about a passionate team!
Their nigiri was exceptional! My favorite was the hamachi toro, saba (the best I've had), and the uni was incredible. 
I would love to go back on a slow night so I can truly be blown away."}
{"text":"Im a diehard sushi addict,
Alot of places are very skeptical of AYCE, but this one tops the cake:

Tuna Poke is my judgement plate, if the poke isnt good the fish isnt good, its hard to maintain tuna and albacore at a good temperature and keep it at a firm and fresh consistency. 

The Sake, everyone loves sake, and almost 99 percent of the time there is a BOGOF sale for a good amount of it.

Environment: Very modern, very clean and very welcoming, the cool colors and open atmosphere really makes you feel relaxed and laid back, the music adds a nice touch to it, mood appeals more to an early 20s to the hip baby boomers kind of crowd.

Staff: Being a waiter myself I really dig out key attributes of the employees, and I have to say, the staff got an A+ from me, we arrived 30 minutes prior to closing ( leaving our own resturaunt to grub here ) not once did any server show a sign of irritation through their actions nor their attitude, they dont pry into the table to make you feel rushed or to give you a \"hint\". Their overall attitude is great.

The food overall is excellent, quite a few exotic dishes that require a favored taste such as Urchin, Eel and Roe were top knotch, and definitely going to be on the list next time I go.

Recommended dishes:
Takoyaki ( Careful, really hot inside the balls )
Unagi 
Chicken Katsu Tempura rolls
Better than Charlie Roll 
Fatty Tuna ( Hands down, my favorite )
Tuna Poke ( Yes )

If the workers read this part: Ive got to say I am really impressed by the resturaunt and do wish to eat here more often, keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. I've been at my table over 45 minutes and have ordered multiple items from the AYCE menu. Everyone else at my table is done with their meals, which they didn't eat because the baked rolls were cold and the cold rolls were warm, and I haven't received anything. I asked my server and she said that she didn't know, because all of my food came out. When I asked the person in charge, he just threw my check in front of me and moved on. Wow...."}
{"text":"I was vistiting lv and my friends brought me to this place.  

One star for the great food but minus four stars for the horrible service from Michelle.  

If your place closes at 1030p on saturday, please change your sign from 11p to the correct time!   Maybe you wouldnt have felt the need to rush our orders, payment and time out.  Really? Did you have to turn off ALL the lights on us while we were eating? And the immature attitude afterwards while speeding away from the place?  Unprofessional and definitely not acceptable."}
{"text":"We have a favorite sushi place up the road but thought we would try this out. My nose told me very quickly to turn back but we stayed anyway. It's average price. Rolls are not big or small. There is no fancy roll here. It's just another sushi place. It didn't turn out to be as bad as my nose told me, but I will be going back to my regular place next time."}
{"text":"I used to be a loyal customer for a few years before the new owner took over. And the main reason I did not go back was that they got a C grade by the health district back then. Me and my boyfriend was looking to dinein at the sushi place near our place so I thought I'd give them another shot. We ordered few nigiris. I am not kidding- the quality of all of fish was below average. I was very disappointed. We also ordered uni nigiri and when servers brought them to us I noticed they were all not in good condition. I mean you literally can tell if you eat them you will get sick. That's how bad they were. We were upset and talked to our server how bad they are and she was like \"Yes, I know they are not that great.\" We were like wtf????? I mean like would you eat them? You basically serving low quality fish knowing that they are in bad condition. I lost for words. So we returned them back, of course. And also, we ordered few other items but she did not even bring them to us and did not check up on us either. We wanted to complain about it but thought we'd better not cause we won't be returning. Appetizers were okay so there goes 2 stars. Bad service, low quality food and expensive. Sorry Kaizen sushi"}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorite nearby sushi places, however the service we received today from the waitress, Jina, was very slow. She seemed overwhelmed, which is understandable as the place was full when we first arrived, however I noticed that she did not return to our table after much time had passed, and even after having made eye contact with us, knowing we were still here waiting to order more food. My friend said this isn't the first time she has come to this restaurant and had a negative experience with Jina. The food and everything else is exceptional -- great place and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I've ordered out here many times and it's been great... until today. We went to eat their all you can eat dinner meal. The service was sooo slow. We ended up leaving having eaten only two rolls each. Super disappointed"}
{"text":"It has a long list of offerings for it AYCE selections. The reported \"crab\" was invariable imitation through menu items. Service was fast tonight. Look at my check in for the rolls that worked for us. 

* half roll option is awesome'"}
{"text":"Very good food. I have had trouble finding a sushi restaurant with quality of fish similar to that in LA. This is the closest. They give large portions. The prices are pretty much the same as other places in Las Vegas, but portions are larger and fish is more fresh. Very friendly staff. Good happy hour. Have gone back three or four times and each experience was consistent with this review."}
{"text":"This is a great sushi restaurant! Great happy hour and sushi specials, extremely friendly and helpful staff, and a great atmosphere. The food is great, the sushi is fresh, and the dessert menu is rich with options as well.

The only drawback I could think of is the restaurant is in a busy strip mall with a Buffalo Wild Wings and a 5 Guys Burger place, making parking difficult during dinner times. But for great sushi, it's worth the pain of parking."}
{"text":"This is my first bad yelp review. I never write bad yelp reviews but there's nothing I hate more than being lied to as a customer. 

We walked in at midnight ... I've been here many many times before at all different hours and the place closes at 2. No where on the website or on the menu do they advertise that after midnight there is no all you can eat pricing. The waiter tells us that there is no all you can eat after midnight. 

I said I didn't know and is there any way he could honor the pricing since it was midnight exactly and that wasn't something that was known. Rather than saying no sorry that's our policy he says the system is down and we can't do that. I asked of the system is down how were they going to ring us up and he laughed and said the all you can eat system is down. 

Just be honest. Say you can't. Don't make up stories that even make you chuckle at how terrible it sounds. 

We ended up leaving disappointed not because we had to pay but because the staff was disingenuous. And they have you write yelp reviews for free menu items which are against yelp policy. Won't be making the drive back from the southwest"}
{"text":"I will put up against and sushi place in Los Angeles. Very fresh, great service. It's to bad it's a hike for me because I live in North West Las Vegas"}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi place! I love the crazy boy roll and the orange blossom roll. The service is good and the sushi is great. My family and I are constantly going back to kaizen when we crave sushi."}
{"text":"I've eatten here many many times and I've never had a bad experience! The all you can eat is the way to go! And if you have friends that are new to sushi and a bit nervous about the \"raw fish\" thing bring them here so they get a taste of the fresh goodness!"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot and would definitely go back but I'm rating it 4 stars because I ordered 3 orders of eel and they had a loooooot of bones. I couldn't stop coughing coz it got stuck in an awkward part of my throat. Other than that I recommend the avocado train for avocado lovers! Don't miss out on that!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, rolls are tiny, took an hour to order and receive 3 rolls. There are a million other sushi spots on s. Eastern that definitely beat this place in all categories."}
{"text":"Okay this place has good food, good service and a nice environment to enjoy your good food and service. The only thing I did not enjoy was the rice that was piled up on every roll we order. Me and my husband got the AYCE. So maybe that's why. But I'm pretty sure I had a rice roll in my sushi roll that already had rice on it."}
{"text":"If the review were only for price and taste, they'd get 5 stars. But the service has been really bad both times we've been here. The place is full and there are 2 servers. They keep giving our food to other tables. Didn't get drinks until the meal was over. $22 for lunch AYCE would be a great deal if you could actually get your money's worth."}
{"text":"great food ....great service....recommend to anyone. The honey toast is a great way to finish the meal"}
{"text":"Been here a few times food is always great and so us the service...Orange Blossom Silver state King of the Sea rolls are THE BEST....only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the way they stress the WE CHARGE FOR LEFT OVERS part is very rude..If you find a way to make that a lil less rude this place would be perfect....."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place in Las Vegas IMHO. Jay and Jacob are the best chef. They talked to you, they remember what you like on your food, and they attentive enough to offer more food when you're done with your plate. The raw stuff here are super fresh. They do offer AYCE now and it's the best deal. This is not paid advertisement btw ;) I'm just a regular who really love the sushi here.
Btw my husband loves the fact that they are playing cool music videos in here. :))"}
{"text":"Food was excellent, service efficient and prices reasonable!  I was at a much pricier sushi restaurant the night before and this place was actually better!  Great sushi."}
{"text":"The sushi here is always amazing and the service is quick! We like to bring the whole family, friends or just a date for the two of us! They are consistent and the all you can eat is a must!!!"}
{"text":"The worst sushi I have ever had. EVER. We got four different rolls (kiss of fire, hawaiian, better than charlie, sexy) and they were all a very mushy, unappetizing texture. $50 in the garbage--literally."}
{"text":"This is literally the worst service I have ever had at a sushi restaurant. I will give them the benefit of the doubt on maybe it being an off night. But I will never be back. 

Instead of indulging you in the details, I'll list the complaints. 

Waitresses switch midservice and confuse orders, orders are split and do not come out at the same time, waited approximately 30 min between each order of sushi came out, received the wrong sushi order, uni was brown and old and the list goes on. 

Get more chefs, get competent staff and promote the bus boy because we enjoyed more refills of water than sushi orders."}
{"text":"I dont know why I've never tried this place considering I've been living in henderson for almost a decade. I wanna say best place for sushi hands down! I've tried many different places around vegas and found a few hidden gems but not quite like kaizen. the rolls are super fresh and their ayce lunch is not very expensive. we ordered many half rolls and the ones that stood out the most were the orange blossom, monster, unicorn, sex bomb and so on. they also have great appetizers that was perfect for my child and myself included. if you are hesitant to try this place, give it a shot during lunch and if you dont enjoy it then maybe sushi is not for you"}
{"text":"Was in the area, so we tried it. Nothing special. Rainbow Roll was lacking avocado and more California than anything; skimpy on fish. The yellow tail sashimi was very good, as was miso soup. Everything else was average."}
{"text":"The prices were good for all you can eat. Too bad only 1 out of 6 of the rolls I had were good.  Service was a fail. It took us 10 mins to be spoken to once seated. Will never go back"}
{"text":"I have tried multiple sushi places in vegas and this is the worst one so far.
The sushi is bad- rolls fell apart, some pieces didn't even contain all the ingredients, we got the appetizer as the last item way after all the rolls, it didn't taste good nor fresh. One of the rolls wasn't as ordered. Service took super long and server couldn't even tell us how many pieces the rolls have.
Bad experience, my stomache is not happy."}
{"text":"Stay away from this spot! Not fresh fish at all. Horrible service. After waiting 15-20mins at my table, I had 5 different servers that didn't communicate with each other. When I got the food it was so disgusting I had to leave. 
The manager doesn't really know how to run a restaurant. 
I'm not sure how they got good reviews."}
{"text":"Sushi fell apart, their salmon sushi tasted kind of funny, their Hawaiian roll fish tasted old, finally not recommended."}
{"text":"I'm sorry I just can't go beyond a one star; Aliante and Centennial Hills have some pretty decent sushi bars (sushi loca and sushi tachi come to mind) but this is not one of them in my opinion; I found both the rice and the fish tasted old and the service was very lackluster; will not be going back."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick bite and think we found our new favorite place. Everything was delicious and great two for one alcohol specials after nine. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Best sushi place in Las Vegas!!!
Love the large menu to go with the all you can eat option. And they have a punch card rewards. Nothing like a free all you can eat."}
{"text":"Vegas is ridiculously far from the ocean and this place reflects that.  The rolls taste like Safeway rolls and the sashimi was mostly bad. Only one out of our 3 nigiri sushi tasted fresh"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars because:

1) The quality of raw fish was great, better than most AYCE restaurants in Vegas
2) I love the interior decor, very hip, perfect for a date
3) Very large variety of nigiri, sushi rolls, and non-sushi items (be sure to look at the back of the AYCE menu, there are some hidden gems there, ie: rib-eye steak, pork katsu)


My favorites were: Japanese Lasagna roll, salmon nigiri, and seared albacore sashimi special.... And their tempura cheesecake of course!  I'll definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Maybe I was unfortunate considering all these positive reviews, but this place was definitely a huge let down on many different levels.

Coming into the place it's small and the walls are painted pea soup green.  For those of you unaware of what that color is, it's what guacamole looks like after it's been exposed to air for 15-20 minutes.  Not pretty.

Whatever, maybe it was part of their theme.  We were meeting some friends there and easily found them.  The sushi bar is in the middle of the restaurant, but looks more like a DJ booth - off standish and nothing really to look at.  It was overly large, as if their tiny establishment could serve far more than they could fit.

We sat down and started with a couple of sake bombs.  The waitress kept saying \"300 dollars\" instead of \"300 milliliters\" when our friends asked about the house sake size in comparison to the named sake size.  Since it was -just- sake bombs we didn't feel a need to spend a lot on the sake.  She kept diverting the question and trying to use her cutesy accent to avoid giving a direct answer - a wonderful theme that continued for the rest of the night.

The sake and beer arrive and we are presented with plastic beer mugs that looks like they should have been retired quite some servings ago.  OK, maybe they keep them for the bombs since they have the potential of being, ehrm, \"destructive.\"  One nice point - the sushi chef came out to count down for our first round and that was fun.  After that, the waitress said we couldn't just \"sit there and drink\" and that there was a \"law\" that we had to order food while we were there.  All of us had planned on eating and had told her that BEFORE we ordered the sake bombs, but OK.  Sure.

We had to tell her on four separate occasions we were ready to order.  Yet she kept finding things to do, like assisting the two small parties outside of our group of 5 - mind you, the three tables were the ONLY ones in the restaurant at 6pm on a Friday night.  So after she had JUST made it a point to tell us to basically order food or pay your bill and leave because it was a LAW, she REFUSED to come over until one of the people at our table said, \"We'd like to order NOW.\"

Ordered our food and when she came to me I ordered the Las Vegas Roll.  She said if I order more I would get a discount, but if I only ordered one I would get no discount.  I asked, \"Oh, is the second roll 50% off, then?\" because there is a sign outside the establishment that says, \"Sushi 50% All The Time.\"  She paused for a moment, then said, \"You get a discount.\"  Thank you for letting me know AGAIN I get a discount, but that doesn't tell me WHAT I get.  I rephrased my question, \"How much of a discount?\"  She replied, \"Oh, you know, discount off second roll.\"

This was obviously going somewhere.  I said, \"I'll think about it after the first roll, thank you,\" and she gave me a wan smile.  She also asked how we'd like to split the sake and the beer since we mentioned 3 of us were on one tab and 2 of us on another.  She kept making it sound like we could not split it because there was a monetary difference between the sake and beer, saying we had to \"order more to even it out.\"  None of us really understood at first because she was really thickening up her accent, and were really confused.  We asked if we could decide later and she said, \"Yes but it's better if you let me know now for splitting the check, ne?\"  She wasn't making a ton of sense until we pointed out that we did realize there was a difference in price and that was fine.  Once one of the members of our group said they would take the sake on theirs and the beer would go on the other, she finally bowed down from that argument.

The sushi came out fairly fast but considering it was mostly empty, what do you expect?  My Las Vegas Roll was more of a deep-fried Philadelphia roll with no smooth meaty taste of fish to really account for.  Had I ordered a deep-fried Philadelphia roll, I would have been alright with that.  It was supposed to have crab (which I did not see ANY of) and eel (which was barely there).  The edamame, at least, was OK.  Satisfied with our experience up to that point, we asked for the check, paid, and left.  The check was a fair price, at least.  When I walked out the door the waitress completely ignored me and made it a  point to walk elsewhere; I was also not acknowledged by another wait or chef staff.  Cool.

To summarize, I do NOT plan on returning to this place at all.  Service was rude, slow, and felt like you were trying to be hussled; food was mediocre at best; and the décor is average.  Take you sushi craving elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went here with a couple of friends.  Very good service and sushi.  AYCE is the way to go.  Everything tasted good and fresh.  Loved the pork belly app!"}
{"text":"I love their all you can eat. The fish is fresh and the rolls are really yummy. A favorite spot that is very consistent!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Favorite AYCE sushi place! Also great customer service! Recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Okay so I've been here a few times before. It's always good. I would have given it maybe three and a half stars.
That was then. This is now.
I got all you can eat with my dad today. 
We'll start with the pros:
Yellowtail negiri SO THICK! It was so fresh and delicious. Apps were amazing especially the seafood pancake. We also got pork belly, a screaming o, beef, fresh fresh oysters, yummy crispy tuna, crab salad. Everything was outstanding.

We got a roll with mango, an oh roll, a calamari roll, a sunset, and a couple others. They do half rolls so you can try more stuff. Everything was super fresh and not drenched in sauces. Also, unlimited mochi. And dinner has Toro and yellowtail belly, Hamachi kama, full ribeye steaks, and whole mackerel. 

The only cons is they forgot some of the stuff we ordered so we had to order multiple times even though the waitress wrote it all down. Once, a new waitress came, asked if we wanted more water and to place another order, and we said yes to both. She got us our water and then walked away and forgot about our food order. There was only one waitress that seemed to have it together. But they were all very nice and we just assumed they might be new.

Either way. So good I can overlook it.

My new favorite for sure."}
{"text":"If you're okay with the slightly above average price, you'll likely have a pleasant dining experience with acceptable quality food and good/friendly service.

We dropped by on a Saturday evening to try them out. I was expecting to wait since it was Saturday night,. They were bustling, but we were seated quickly, so that was a plus.

The service is prompt, friendly and competent. The ambiance is a little rough, but okay. Ultimately, it's clean ... enough.

The real plus to dining here is the variety of food included in the AYCE. It is wide and varied from sushi, to grilled, to skewers and plenty of rolls to choose from.

One negative aspect we experienced was receiving a piece of tuna that was clearly not \"Toro\". Unfortunately, plenty of AYCE sushi places do this expecting most of their customers not to be familiar with what certain fishes look like. But since we aren't paying for each piece individually, it's hard to feel like it's something worth complaining about.

Ultimately, if we have a hankering for something they specifically have on their menu, we would probably go back. But if we only want AYCE sushi, there are better and slightly cheaper places to go to."}
{"text":"I decided to go with Kaizen Fusion Roll and Sushi because I was looking for something healthy to order on UberEATS. 

Though the menu on UberEATS was not very descriptive, the menu on GrubHub's browser menu was super detailed, which made me know exactly what was in my roll. 

The food was delivered on time and tasted amazing! Just look at my picture of the Spicy Rainbow Roll!! It legitimately looks like art.... and it was delivered!! (I put the spicy mayo and siracha they gave me on the side on it before taking a photo)

I highly recommend Kaizen!"}
{"text":"For one I love sushi and I love 50% off sushi. My husband and I enjoy our date night here. Friendly staff and good food make for a great night."}
{"text":"I have had fish not so fresh here before.  Overly fishy tasting and slimy. I was weary about eating here again.   Of course I was outnumbered. It is close by and open later. 

I went for all you can eat so I could have variety.   My favorite is the super white tuna.  They redeemed themselves!  It tasted clean and fresh.  The delicious lemony acidic sauce they serve on the regular menu.  All the raw fish I ordered was great!  My boyfriend said he didn't recognize the chef and he must be new, perhaps this change is the improvement in the quality they are serving. 

Our server seemed to be in a bad mood.  Must have been an off day for him.  Also we were the last guests for the evening.   He did make a great suggestion for the ribeye.  It was tasty and the veggies were cooked just right.  I wasn't able to fill my stomach.  We arrived before closing time.   

Hope this quality remains consistent.  I'd like to arrive earlier next time to try everything else."}
{"text":"Sushi spot that closes late, I wish there were some like this in my area! I ordered the sake maki even though it wasn't on the menu, they made it for me! Sushi was good, portions and prices are decent. Service is a bit slow on that particular late night but food was good so I can't complain."}
{"text":"You know that feeling when you wanna cry not because your feel sad that the food was little or bad? On the contrary I was gonna cry because food was yummy and plentiful. I was full all the way above my stomach!  Well it's all you can eat. It's AYCE. 

So far, this tops
my list of ayce here in Vegas. The uni sushi was bountiful and delicious. The salmon sushi and sashimi just Kept on coming (well because we kept on ordering and ordering :). 
Will come
Back here to bring my 4 voracious boys!  
Oh and Wei, our server is gracious and entertaining. Thank you, Wei!"}
{"text":"I hope this help. This was just our experience there today. But here goes. 

So we get there right , and we get seated and it's fine and she takes our drink orders (2 waters and a coke) and then like 5 mins later she takes the sushi order, my friends and I got all you can eat. We ordered 6 rolls, So they're halfway to eating them , it must have been like half an hour and still no drinks. So My friend was like \"can we get our drinks?\" And she said \"oh we have no cups right now\" ...and I'm looking at like 5 empty dirty tables with cups sitting there. So I'm like \"ok\" and then the guys finish their sushi and we wait. And at this point it's been like 45 min we already finished our first round and still no drinks. So we wait another 5-10 min so they can order more and still no drinks, no service , nothing. So my friend walked up to another waitress asked for help. So please tell what we're supposed to do at this point when an hr into our dining and we got 6 rolls with no drinks.
Unfortunately the service were not the best.  and no one was owning up to what happened. I've never been so disappointed in my life at a restaurant. Normally I'd understand because they're busy and what not but this was just ridiculous. I am a former waiter so I know what it's like to give a service. This was not it. 
I had a horrible experience."}
{"text":"My son 1st introduced me to kaizen & it has rapidly become my go to place for sushi! With the fun personalities of the chefs and their creative flare this is a place that never disappoints whether it is a business dinner or a casual night out with the hubby! Another bonus is it is close to home and the price is right if you love to eat!"}
{"text":"Yummy food and great service! Wade and Adam were awesome! Best service we've had in a long time!!"}
{"text":"Some co-workers decided to order from this place. Well when the order was delivered to our office, the order  was missing 3 entrees. 
So I politely phoned the Resturant back to notify them and the 2 orders of a fried salmon roll was in the same container and I was told  that 1- order consist of only 5 pieces. Why would that be proper? Sanitary? The price for that was an over priced $9.95. The third order was corrected and no apologies or explanation for the  screw up.. I had a horrible experience and won't ever opt to order from them again. So congrats you've managed to lose a potential 85 customers. (The number of employees I've told thus far about the rip off we received )"}
{"text":"I came here for the all you can eat lunch for $22, and I was not disappointed.  There are three whole menu pages of all you can eat menu items, including steaks that are usually $20 or more.  My wife and I both did the all you can eat option, and we shared six rolls and three appetizers between us.  All of the rolls were great, but sometimes a little heavy on the sauce they were plated with.  The only disappointment was the \"yummy yummy crispy tuna\" appetizer, which consists of large chunks of ahi tuna served on fried wonton wrappers.  The tuna was tough to chew, and had lots of connective tissue/fat that I could not eat.  Other than that, the rest of the fish was very good.  The service was also great, and our waitress was very professional, but there were only two couples in the whole restaurant at the time.  The sushi roll prep could have been a little faster, especially considering that there were only two groups ordering food in the whole restaurant, but they might bring on additional chefs for busy times.

Overall, a great restaurant, and I will be back the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Everyone in this area says Sushi Loca is the best but I didn't have a good experience there so I wanted to check out other places and this was the only decent one I saw.  Not a fan. Sat at the bar, hard to understand the sushi chef.  Appetizers and drinks took a while to come out. The search continues...."}
{"text":"So far.....

In the middle of the meal (to get free sake)...

It's awesome!!! Japanese beer, sake and nigiri is a must."}
{"text":"I'm typically weary of AYCE sushi places only because they don't seem fresh. And I'm not willing to have tummy problems while visiting friends.  However, Kaizen couldn't be further from that. I was pleasantly surprised to find that their AYCE option was not only affordable, but included a lot of their menu which allowed us to try a bunch of different items. 

Our friends ordered the fried rice and a few rolls where my husband and I ate the nigiri style sushi - also loved the Poké bowl too! I really loved ordering a few pieces at a time and I was impressed with how delicious and fresh each piece was!

Aside from dinner being amazing I rated it four, not five stars, because of the long wait to receive our check. We had amazing service up until we finished and it seemed like the wait staff and servers disappeared. At one point there was only one person waiting every table! Eventually, about 10-15 minutes later, we managed to grab the attention of our waitress and were able to check out. 

I really loved this place and am always on the lookout for new sushi spots to try. The AYCE is an amazing offer and their sushi is of the highest quality and served fresh. I really look forward to making our way back again and again for dinner!"}
{"text":"This place has stepped it up so much. It's,
like, not even the restaurant I used to think it was.

The first time I came here, the service was so poor that I never wanted to come back. Well, I ended up coming back anyway like a year or two later ONLY because I remembered that even though their service was poor, at least the fish was fresh. I got food to go this time so I wouldn't have to deal with their crappy service for very long. To my surprise, the hostess was extremely friendly, as was the owner/manager (male) and I only waited about 15 minutes. The food was delicious and they took extra care in packaging it so that everything traveled well. You don't get that a lot when you order food to-go! I noticed during this visit that they started doing AYCE (they didn't the first time I'd been here) and since the service was nothing like it was that first time, I decided I'd try dining in again sometime.

And so I did a few weeks later. I came through with my sister, husband and two kids. We got the AYCE (I think it was like $26 per person for dinner). The menu was HUGE, the variety was excellent. In addition to the large assortment of sushi rolls we Yelpers have come to expect at AYCE joints in Las Vegas, the menu also has a ton of appetizers and even smaller portions of some of the entrees. The service was quick, friendly, and the food was fresh and delicious. We brought my 2-year-old son with us and they said we'd have to pay full price if we wanted to share our food with him. Understandable, but he would never eat close to $26 of sushi so we ordered him a children's entree. Ummm... Did I say children's entree? That's what they call it, but this was a huge bento box with golden chicken katsu, crispy gyoza, spring mix salad, steamed rice, and hot miso soup. I could've eaten it for dinner and been satisfied! It was a super good value. I can't believe they give so much food for the price of a children's entree! Anyway, none of the servers ever rushed us or acted inconvenienced when we ordered more food (I'm looking at you, Sushi Tachi). Everyone at Kaizen was just genuinely nice and accommodating from beginning to end.

Just to make sure this wasn't all a fluke (I was still skeptical because my first experience was that bad), I came back with my husband for lunch on a random weekday. We didn't get the AYCE this time, but they had a lunch special that was something like 2 sushi rolls and a salad for $10 or $11 (don't quote me on that). Yadda-yadda, the food and service were a hit again.

So I'm sold. Kaizen is wonderful and I'm SO HAPPY that it exists because there aren't many choices on the north side of town. 

TL;DR: Kaizen used to suck but now everything about it is so awesome that it doesn't even matter that it used to suck."}
{"text":"Our new favorite sushi spot and it's close to home. For the longest we used to go all the way to Yama Sushi on Maryland and flamingo. But a friend told us of kaizen and we love it. The oysters, white tuna, BBQ shirt ribs and hamachi Kama are just a few of our favorites. The thing that really makes this place awesome is the service. We've been there too many times than I can remember and we always have Wei and Pear serving us. They are awesome and always taking care of us. It sad to hear that Wei is no longer there, but are so thankful we still get to see Pear!!! The icing on the cake is that they have a punch card so you get a stamp for every all you can eat person in your party. Once you get 10 stamps, the 11th one is free!!! Who doesn't love a free all you can eat sushi meal!!!"}
{"text":"My Bf and I wanted to try a new sushi place in our area. Stumbled across Kaizen and decided to try it. Walked in greeted by the hostess/waitress and immediately sat us down. Not busy at all with only two other couples inside. 

It was our first time and we knew we wanted AYCE ($23 for lunch) sushi but weren't sure if there was a separate menu for AYCE or if we were able to order from the menu that was handed to us. Our waitress brought our drinks and asked if we were ready? Not really explaining the AYCE menu bc depending where you go certain places has their own AYCE rules.

Surprisingly there were very few things that we COULD NOT order and there were lots to choose from. Salads, bowls, soups and sides come in smaller portions which is normal and why would you wanted huge portions anyways? 

I always order my Phili Roll, shrimp tempura and what caught my eye was the Crispy rice w/Tuna to start. My boyfriend also ordered his usual hamachi and maguro to start. Everything came out and actually didn't taste too bad. The only thing that I didn't like was that they put asparagus in my roll which they normally don't. I like asparagus just not in that roll

We then ordered the half a rainbow roll, yum yum roll and a dragon roll. My boyfriend loved the yum yum roll which was simple and packed with crab. The dragon and rainbow roll were meh, I felt the like the combination of sauces were not good. You had the creamy sauce and then a dark liquidy runny sauce that made what was suppose to be a creamy sauce not so creamy. Idk just not good plus what was inside didn't match well with sauces. 

We also ordered shrimp fried rice, KFC (Korean Fried Chicken), screaming O salad, miso and shoyu ramen. Shrimp fried rice and KFC, so bomb! That, I'd have any time. My boyfriend said the shoyu ramen was not bad, just a bit on the watery side. My miso soup was watery and didn't have any taste. Screaming O was okay, the sauce was not your typical white creamy sauce they usually use. More on the ginger, soy kinda sauce. A little disappointed bc that's my fav!

Lastly, Desert my favorite part but also the most disappointing part. We ordered the \"mini honey toast\" when it came out it was on what looked like a Hawaiian sweet roll with vanilla ice cream and honey drizzled all over. Hmmm.. at least toast the bread? Come on that's why it's called Honey TOAST, lol. None the less it was okay I guess.

Overall the food was decent. Certain things I won't order again if I make my way back here. Just be aware to not over do it bc on the front of the menu it states that they will charge for food not eaten including rice! You also only have an hour and a half to eat. 

As for service, it was lacking. There was only 3 couples including us. It took her a while to come to us to refill our drinks or place another order, so we had to flag her down every time she skipped us and went to the table right behind us. Maybe had she paid more attention to us instead of her phone I'd rate this place a bit higher bc as we were finishing up our server had changed and he was on it but by that time we were done."}
{"text":"Well, I got the Japanese Lasagna and it was great.  I hadn't had sushi in a while so it brought my love back to life!  I wasn't impressed with the rest of the menu choices, nor the prices.  My boyfriend had teriyaki chicken and for that price , he got a ton of rice.  I'm not sure about the chicken to vegetable ratio though.  The lady was always refilling our drinks.  Service was quick.  Overall, not a bad experience.  Another thing, I couldn't \"check in\" to this place.  I see that other people have, so maybe google maps was just acting up that day."}
{"text":"surprisingly really good. friendly servers, and adorable presentation. I really enjoyed everything I tried"}
{"text":"I really used to enjoy coming to this place but lately since they so-called say that they have changed management everything has changed the service has changed it's absolutely horrible and the food is not as fresh as it used to be. I wish things would go back to the way that it was."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and came out very quickly! The staff was super nice and multiple people would check on us to make sure everything was good with the food and the service. We will definitely come back for another visit soon. You won't be disappointed if you come to dinner here."}
{"text":"No \"to go menu\", had to stand around or sit at a dining table while I waited for my take out order. $30 for 2 rolls and 2 pieces of salmon sushi, which is bad enough but every bite tasted like warm glue. Never in my life have I thrown out sushi before. This place and its food is the WORST sushi experience in my 20 years here!"}
{"text":"If you have allergies and/or food restrictions be cautious. I follow a vegetarian/vegan diet and was fed pork in a gyoza that is listed as vegetable dish.  

Physically sitting in the restaurant as I write this. This is my 3rd or 4th visit and typically come with family. It's one of my preferred food spots because I do not consume meat and it has many options including a vegetable gyoza. On my first visit I double checked with the server that there is no meat in the gyoza as in my experience at other restaurants there typically is. It was confirmed that it is a vegetable dish. Today I came for all you can eat and ordered one order of vegetable gyoza. When I later asked for my second order the server corrected me when I said \"vegetable\" and advised that there is actually pork in the gyoza. I double checked the menu it says vegetable. Another server went to verify with the cooking staff and returned to explain that \"typically\" it is vegetable but their shipment was off so they had to include pork in the gyoza. 

I was offered an \"apology\" and was told \"I can take 20% off of your meal but that's all I can do.\" I ordered edamame and a veggie roll and did all you can eat with intention of ordering additional gyoza rolls. 20% seems like a \"kind\" gesture but without the gyoza my ticket would have been $12-$15 a la carte. Their response and lack of regard for the seriousness of this was disappointing. Will not return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that my hubby and I are forever grateful to our friends for introducing us to this Sushi restaurant as we are always reluctant to try new Sushi restaurants as there are so many along Eastern that have been a disappointment.  Our friends are Korean and they took us here because it is a Korean/Japanese fusion restaurant.

On our first visit with our friends, we let them take control and just order for our table.  At that time there was no All You Can Eat menu yet so everything we had was A La Carte.  We ordered the party tray which is a variety of Sushi, Sashimi, Rolls, and Tempura on a Large wooden Boat.  Our children had the 2 item Bento special with Chicken Katsu and Tempura Vegetable.  We were pleasantly surprised to have been served \"FRESH\" Wasabi rather then your typical wasabi paste. Our friends ordered a side of gochujang sauce (Korean hot pepper paste sauce) and my hubby always gets a side of ponzu for his sushi and rolls (instead of using soy sauce).  Ok are you ready for this...if you mix the (1) fresh wasabi, (2)gochujang and (3)ponzu all together you have will have an amazing dip for your sushi, rolls, and pretty much everything else you're eating at your table!  YES it is THAT good!  We even shared this bit of information with the Sushi Chef.  By the way the Chefs/Waiters, and waitresses are extremely friendly.  The atmosphere of the entire restaurant is just inviting.  There is a large screen that plays random music videos and of course they have \"Gangnam Style\" on rotation and if your nice the Sushi Chef will even do the dance for you  if you ask.  

Since our first visit to this restaurant, they have added an All You Can Eat option for lunch and dinner.  We were at first worried because usually when an All You Can Eat is added on a Sushi menu all that means is All You Can Eat (poorer) quality fish...BUT NOT at Kaizen!  They use the same fresh ingredients in their A la Carte menu that they do on the All You Can Eat menu.  The Sushi Chef's will also be more then happy to do customized rolls if you don't see what you want on the menu or if you dare to try something new.  I will also add that with All You Can Eat there is a salad bar available that is A-mazing!  If you order A la Carte, the salad bar is on $5 and they give you a decent size bowl.  The salad bar has Mixed Greens, Tuna Sashimi, Cucumber/mango salad, Crab Salad with Jalapeno, Seaweed salad, sweet octopus, and a variety of fish salad.  

I will end this with, we have not eaten Sushi anywhere else since we started coming here...their service is consistent and their food is superb! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I came because we got a Groupon. There was zero wait at 5:30 on Friday night (a bit weird). The decor is very modern and does not feel at all crowded. There's the obligatory Japanese pop music playing loudly. The sushi chefs appeared to be Japanese, which bodes well. 

The food (pictures have been posted!): Boyfriend had the shrimp tempura roll and the beef teriyaki bowl. I sampled the roll; it was delicious. Anything covered in that much eel sauce is bound to make me happy! He said the bowl was good, but the beef was cut too thinly. I had the salmon teriyaki roll and the hungry roll. They were good, not great. The portions were big, which is something I always worry about when it comes to sushi. 

All in all, I doubt we'll be back. I'm very sure that there are better places to try, so I don't see the point in going back for food that wasn't as good as it can be!"}
{"text":"Worst AYCE sushi I have experienced. Came in on a Friday night with 3 other people and all got AYCE. The service was incredibly slow and when they finally took our order they kept forgetting things! I only ended up with about half of what I actually ordered and we kept having to ask over an over again just to get enough food for everyone to eat. As far as taste and quality of sushi, it was just OK. I'm sure if you are the kind of person who just wants a California roll for your \"sushi experience\" this place will do but  if you are thinking about getting AYCE DO NOT GO HERE. You will have to keep ordering the same things every time you will not get your complete order. You will leave here frustrated and still hungry like myself and the rest of my group did. If you are looking for a good AYCE place try out Sushi Tachi or Sasa Sushi as they both have really good AYCE and great service."}
{"text":"Great dinner for mother's day in town!!! Nice staff and great sushi chef in the house. Recomanded!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place for all you can eat sushi in all of Las Vegas. Please come here and will not be desappointed if you love good quality sushi, great service and reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Hip. Nice 25% off happy hour 3-6pm. Even family friendly, they gave us some tofu cubes for our one-year-old. We were the only ones there on a Weds afternoon, but the rolls took a little too long to make for just the two of us."}
{"text":"If I could I would give this a no Stars! We came in and was seated right away. 15 minutes after being seated finally someone came to take our order. Husband finished his food and wanted more sushi. 20 minutes he asked a staff member for it. The man responded \"let me go let some one know!\" Would of left by now if the kids were not still eating. 15 minutes late I have to go find the manager to get my husbands sushi rolls made, and asked if this is how his busy usually runs. He said it wouldn't happen again. 10 minutes later our waitress came from no where, how are you going? I responded very unhappy can you tell me if my husbands sushi was ordered. 5 minutes later she brings his sushi to him. (It was stilling at the sushi bar  about 5 minutes) not happy with the lack of service they provide and lack of communication they have with their staff."}
{"text":"My daughter and I came in for and early mothers day lunch. I'm sad to say the only positive thing I can say about the service here was the gentlemen who brought us our drinks was pleasant and our food was okay. Let me start with our server. Unfortunately she never introduced herself. She was rude during our entire lunch. She seemed annoyed when I asked her to explain certain items on the menu. I brushed it off and just enjoyed being out with my daughter. We left planning on going shopping and continuing our mother daughter day.  I checked my bank account. I noticed I had 2 charges, neither were pending. So I went back inside. No one came to greet me. My waitress saw me standing there and did not come over to see if I needed anything. Finally I waved her down and she came over. I explained to her that I showed 2 charges for my lunch. She told me my card had declined and so she ran it again. So I told her that it did not decline but rather charge me 2 times. I pulled up my bank app and showed her the dbl charge.She told me she had wells Fargo as well and that since the first charge didnt go through it would fall off. I was irritated but decided to call my bank and confirm instead of arguing this point. My bank informed me that this was not correct. And that I was in fact double charges. As I spoke to the teller at the bank in front of the waitress I relayed what he said. The waitress rolled her eyes and asked me to come behind her counter and view her computer to see she had only charged me 1 time. At this point I was very upset. I obviously do not work there and understand their computer system. I told her I'd like to speak to her manager which she informed me there was no manager on site.  I told her this whole ordeal was completely unacceptable and I was completely disappointed. She said \" I dont know what to tell you theres nothing I can do\" . At that point I was done. I told her she was rude and asked for her name and the managers card. She wrote down his number for me and I left. I was upset so I dont remember her name but I believe it may have been Christy.  I called the manager who was apologetic for the card mishap and said he'd get back to me. He did in fact get back to me by text at 12am and explained they had an issue with their merchant services and apologized stating he would reverse the charges. That's it. No apology for his rude staff or he fact I had such a bad experience. I appreciate him following up but find it completely inappropriate that I received a text in the middle of the night. Overall the sushi was just average. Def not worth coming back for such poor service."}
{"text":"The sushi is the best. Try the tuna poki, spicy rainbow and yum yum crispy tuna"}
{"text":"AYCE sushi place with many items to choose from.  You don't have to choose AYCE but I think it's the most bang for your buck.  Lunch prices is about $23 and Dinner I believe was about $5 more.  They have different items to choose from for Dinner.   I do enjoy that for the AYCE you can indulge yourself in 2 desserts .  They do have plenty of seating inside, outside and at the bar.  Went on a Sunday afternoon and was too packed.  If you do enjoy AYCE spots try this one out ."}
{"text":"I really liked it here,  the food is fresh,  tasty, and atmosphere is wonderful.   I sat there for almost 3 hrs all by self, just trying out all different sushi.  Everybody's nice and great service."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi. Fresh and healthy portion. Get the AYCE if you're a big sushi eater."}
{"text":"Yay! They finally opened one easier for me to get to.  I've always liked this restaurant, but never wanted to cross Las Vegas Blvd.  to get to it.  When you walk in you almost feel like you walked into the one on Paradise, but feels slightly larger.  Food was fantastic, service was great as well.  Definitely no complaints.  We ordered the Rose Roll, Hamachi Kama, and a whole bunch of other stuff that I can't remember, but all the food was delicious.  My friend doesn't really go beyond California rolls unless someone else orders it, he loved the jalapeno popper things I order.  Those were my favorite along with the Rose Roll.  Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Ordered a bento box and a curry katsu plate. Big mistake...sushi is their business. Our order took episode mins to be delivered to our table. Bento box ok except for their saba....it was stinky fish and wasn't mackerel...it was a member of the mackerel family...long, thin and bony....The curry katsu lunch was the worst...six tiny burned on the bottom breaded pork slices....the menu should order the katsu curry plate a d then go to Costco for a hot dog..."}
{"text":"We come here all the time. Rivals any all you can eat sushi in town. Everything is fresh and have never had anything that wasn't excellent. Only wish they had quail egg but the food is so good that is easily overlooked!"}
{"text":"It's alright.. Not bad but not awesome!
AYCE could be a little better. Kalbi ribs looked like some mini leftovers and I barely got any meat to get a true itdea what I'm eating. You can only order that item once, the came some Japanese Steak and It was some ground beef with teriyaki.. Wth is that? The sushi is decent but not like damn yo!! I travel for a living and try out a lot of sushi and this place is Aightt. I may visit again but not anytime soon.. I'll try the bento and give them a second chance."}
{"text":"This review is NOT about the sushi. They have GREAT sushi. This review is about the service. I've been to this place about 8 times and the same thing happens every time. If you sit at the sushi bar, the chefs will take great care of you! However, of you sit at a table, you will be ignored. In fact, even if you do sit at the bar, the servers that handle drinks and other necessities will ignore you. The sushi chef will frequently yell at the servers from behind the bar to tell them \"get them drinks\" or \"bring them chopsticks\" or even \"bring them the check\".  It's always the same servers that are horrible EVERY TIME! I don't know why they still work there. Service like this will cause a restaurant to close."}
{"text":"I really love this place for their AYCE! It's almost the entire menu for your choosing and a really great price. I love how close it is to my house and how friendly the staff is. Super fresh foods and an awesome environment, definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My kids and I did the AYCE sushi and I really loved all the sushi rolls we got, and the sides. The service was super slow though, we never got drink refills, and took about 10+ minutes to get our desserts."}
{"text":"Love the all you can eat menu!!
Great prices and the desserts omg !
Definitely a must if you love sushi!"}
{"text":"This shush bar is great for the price. My favorites are the Orange blossom,  Dragon,  Vegas, I LOVE MY BUTT,  and my favorite to finish the night is super white tuna.
The sushi chef's are focused and attentive. Sake is great here."}
{"text":"So just a couple of fools making so trouble in the neighborhood. Just kidding, a friend and I were just craving sushi right? First place we went to had wonky hours so we pop into the closest one. kaizen! We were seated right away! We had 4 half rolls and all of the were amazing! My favorite was the crazy albacore roll! AMAZING! Will dine again! :D"}
{"text":"First time in North Las Vegas for a wedding. We all decided to give this sushi place a shot since it was so close to our hotel. WOW was I amazed. The sushi was amazing. We even ventured into the \"Something spicy\" roll where you choose the spicyness of the roll. We went with the Skydiving level which was the hottest one. Man, it was delicious but boy did we under estimate the spicyness. Well worth the temporary pain. Definitely will make my way back to that place every-time I visit Vegas. About 20 minutes from the strip where we usually stay but well worth the drive in my opinion. In the top 3 AYCE sushi places I have ever been too."}
{"text":"First time I went everyone in my family ate so much we could barely walk, same for the second, third, fourth and every time after.  Top quality sushi, its the only sushi place that my daughters will eat at, bargain sushi places make them sick.  Nice ambiance, great servers, always great suggestions.  The pork belly is a must."}
{"text":"I lived in Henderson for about a year and Kaizen was far and away the best thing about living there. AWESOME Sushi, my favourite was Spicy Taitaki Roll as well as the Crispy Rice w/Spicy Tuna app. Cool atmosphere, great Green Tea - I can't say enough about this place. Came in with my wife all the time, twice even the two days before I left! I think the other reviewer (CheriM) was our waitress actually ;)"}
{"text":"I came here for a bento box and did take out. While I waited for my food I noticed that the restaurant was really nice and the waitress that was helping me with my take out order was also very pleasant. My bento box came with beef teriyaki, rice, a few pieces of california roll, miso soup, salad w/ ginger dressing, pork gyoza, and shrimp and vegetable tempura. I also ordered a roll that was made with bbq spare ribs instead of fish. I did not like the beef teriyaki because it had a ton of vegetables in it. The california roll was disgusting because the crap was just a lump of fake crab meat and it wasn't even mixed with mayo or anything to make it soft. The tempura was pretty good. I don't like ginger dressing so I didn't like the salad and I didn't try the miso because I was really stuffed after eating everything else. I also did not care for the bbq spare rib roll. It just wasn't my thing."}
{"text":"Terrible service at this restaurant. It's obvious that none of the employees like their jobs. Takes forever to order, the waiter/waitress won't even look at you, and not friendly at all. Definitely not kid friendly. Been there twice and will never go back. Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"We moved here a few months ago from CA and my mom was visiting for my birthday. We were going to go downtown for Sushi but decided to come here when we passed by and saw the sign out front stating it was voted one of the best in Las Vegas. 
We had a great experience and the food was really good and fresh. We both got the Customer's Choice lunch special which comes with one more regular roll and a more expensive special roll along with miso soup and house salad. The dressing is light and has fantastic flavor. 
Our server Daniel recommended sake when we mentioned ordering some and we really liked the Yuzu flavor and kept the frosted glass bottle even!
Service was great and we did not have to ask for anything because we were always checked on by our server and others in the restaurant also. They didn't bug us but were attentive. It was moderately busy in the late afternoon when we went. 
Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"I have been going to Kaizen at least twice a month sometimes three times for about 3 years give or take a few months. I'm like their food and usually  I like their service, that is the reason for the two stars.  My family has grown by two in three years.  I have never needed a reservation before but I walked in on a Thursday and I was greeted by a person I have never seen before.  She asked me if I had a reservation I said no so she asked how many in my party, I said 5 then my wife and kids walked in and all of a sudden she was very sorry but without a reservation they couldn't accommodate us even though the big table by the door on the other side of the partition was empty along with the six top table in the far corner.  I specifically asked about them and she said they were reserved.  I guess I am mad because they didn't want our business because we had kids who more than likely wouldn't be eating sushi.  So to me in my opinion this is not a family friendly place.  We left went to another sushi down the street who wanted and appreciated our business."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It is worth ordering all you can eat because if you do Al la carte the potions are small. On a positive note the food is fresh, delicious, and great service! This spot gets busy so I'm glad we arrived slightly before the dinner rush (615-630).

This has some of the best sushi I've had since living in Japan! Try it!"}
{"text":"The AYCE here is bomb! They don't overdue it with the rice so you can try more things, and the sushi is great quality. Well worth the price and tons of options."}
{"text":"The woman named Cindi does not care about customers or delays and especially not being pleasant. I ordered my food via Eat24 and at least Aaron was awesome to help resolve the issue.  I get people being overwhelmed, and I'm not asking for royal treatment. I just wanted to know how long my order would take after a time was given and not met. Trust me I am not even hangry I ordered well in advance. Cindi should not be fired, but I strongly recommend her taking some customer experience courses and strong coaching from her manager. Oh nevermind, she said her manager was not around that I should call back tonight at 4pm probably when she leaves for her shift. I will still keep ordering from Eat24, because of Aaron R. He is a real example of someone caring about their job and customers. I will never eat at Kaizen and I'll make 100% sure the 20 people I know in our subdivision never go there again."}
{"text":"Sushi and service were both great. Went with my boyfriend on Valentine's Day and it was very busy. We were taken care of and everything was delicious. All of the workers were very polite and attentive even with how busy it was. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I always come here. It's our ultimate favorite sushi spot. The hours are great. Love their new menu !! The owner is always so kind and all the staff are always complimenting us. They're always catering to our orders and make sure everything is delicious, we've never had problems here and have been coming for over a year and a half on a monthly bases. I definitely recommend to friends and family and they never leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Service here is okay. Its typical asian service... meaning you have to ask for more water or tea. Food here is good. I had some roll that they used squid instead of rice which was very good and their udon is also amazing."}
{"text":"I have been to this place/location 2 times now and I have to say, it is a pretty awesome place!

AYCE from 11-430 is only $23 per person! Which is totally worth it because one of the specialty rolls sits at around $14 each. 

I really enjoyed the rock and roll roll since I am trying to do low carb. It is wrapped in a thin roll of cucumber and no rice! Such a nice alternative to all the rice. 

They did offer so cool desserts as well. Tempura cheesecake, tempura ice cream, mini honey toast, Mochi ice cream and tiramisu!

This place is good and has a lot more variety than the other sushi places I've been to!"}
{"text":"Try Snow White, orange blossom and kiss of fire- different taste, yummy, I like to sip plum wine with spicy jalapeño on the top of the kiss of the fire."}
{"text":"amazing this place is really good I commute all the time with my Pham good to come out with the group always fresh!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time eating here yesterday and loved the food. I do the all you can eat sushi and I thought that it was a typical buffet style but to my surprise it is not. The servers come to the table to get in a new order of whatever you'd like from the appetizer menu all the way to desert menu. I like it this way so that the portions are controlled and food is not wasted. If I was to change anything, it would be the parking lot/space. Other than that, I love everything about this place. Definitely would recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time here and while I have enjoyed it before as a speedier alternative to sushi mon, today has not been the same. Should have known something was off with the smell of fish upon entry....Yes it's sushi, but it should not smell like a fish market when you walk in. It's not busy right now and we have been here since around 1240pm for lunch......we are finally just getting our 4 appetizers 15 minutes after we have eaten our sushi..And then for the waitresses to come over and say do u want to order anything esle, I was like I'd just like the rest of the food we ordered to come out before ordering anything else..........The appetizers were too well done.....and then she just came over and was like sorry for the wait I'm the only one here.....that would be fine and understandable....if it were no dead in here.....service is just a little too slow for a place that is not busy......"}
{"text":"I saw the good reviews on yelp and decided to try it out! Sadly I was disappointed with the quality. The rolls were sloppy and falling apart. It took a while to get them. So I'm not totally sure why it looked like a rush job. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was lovely. I may be better in the weekend. We did dine in a week night so it wasn't super busy. I may go back another time to see if there is a difference"}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve one star!  I guess people are clueless when it comes to what \"good sushi\" really is!  Ordered the spicey tuna rolls and they were absolutely disgusting!  So bitter, mushy and nastey tasting!  Definitely was not fresh at all!!!!!  We couldn't even eat them and sent them back.  Waitress was the worst server I've ever encountered!  She threatened to charge us EXTRA for the tuna rolls we sent back!  We all paid for the AYCE and it wasn't worth it!  So then we ordered a couple more different rolls hoping they would be better.  Chose not to get anything with tuna because the tuna was disgusting.  So we had some different rolls with crab.  Turns out...THEIR CRAB IS IMMITATION CRAB!!!!!  It was just as disgusting as the tuna!  Then we had to wait almost 30 minutes for our server to come back to our table to bring us our order after we sent back the tuna!  I'm telling you....do not waste your money going here!  They treat you like s**t and the food is horrific!  I seriously don't know what they were trying to serve people here.  The table directly behind us sent their food back as well and complained to the waitress for pathetic service and fake crab.  They also said they'd never be back again.  We ended up leaving and going elsewhere.  I sure would like to see what the health dept. finds when they come into this place!  It's absolutely the worst sushi and service I've ever had in my life!"}
{"text":"Last time that the wife and I will be coming here for a while. Don't get me wrong, the food is great and has been good for the three plus years we have been coming here but the service is just so awful now. We constantly had to remind them about our orders, the orders came out wrong, and orders came out as half roll for full rolls randomly. I don't know what is going on here but the wait staff is just bad. The past two months there have been different staff each time. It's sad but the service needs to get better because the food is good."}
{"text":"The sushi itself could honestly be better, but I couldn't not give this place 5 stars because of the amazing service! 
They do have quite a selection for fish or non-fish items. The interior is extremely cozy and inviting as well.
But the real 5 star review is for my absolute favorite waiter Daniel! We came in around closing time (rude I know,) but Daniel still gave us amazing service! Extremely polite and could remember all of my specific requests on my rolls without having to ask again.
Definitely give this place a try, and if you get Daniel as your waiter then you are definitely in luck!!!"}
{"text":"This was such a happy and fulfilling experience! Thoroughly enjoyed the food I ordered and the service was beyond great. Super awesome!!! Second time here, definitely a place to check out, gotta go for the ayce!! Recommend the banana roll!! YUM"}
{"text":"First time here and won't be the last!! Ontida was our AWESOME server, she was friendly, fast and made great recommendations such as the wasabi sauce which is amazing and a must try. Everyone was very friendly, the service was fast and efficient and we even had the owner help clear our table and make sure our drinks were full which is always a sign of great service in my eyes. The dessert menu has a lot of options, i enjoyed the tiramisu and the vanilla creme brulee. We will be back very soon!!"}
{"text":"Food was good. I would give it 4 stars if Sushi chef was more hospitable. His personality killed our date night positive vibe."}
{"text":"Love you Kaizen! (Or Umaya ? or whatever you're called now).

This place has changed their name so many time I don't know what they're called anymore so I just call them Kaizen still. Whatever. They could rename their restaurant to Crap Sushi and I'd still come here.

I don't do sea food, which is hard when your friends all want sushi. Kaizen makes it easy for me. Katsu chicken? Sure thing, and it's delicious. And if you're in the mood for a bit of sushi that is fishless, the BBQ ribs roll is AWESOME. 

Sushi loving friends put this at the top of their lists - AYCE is fairly reasonable, especially for being so close to the Strip, and the service is quick and super nice. As someone who goes through a couple diet cokes per meal, they even refill quickly (thanks for that!)."}
{"text":"Living in North Las Vegas, we don't really have many good food options. That's especially true for sushi. After trying all the places on this side of town. (Aliante area)
I usually always order it and carry out. Always done within 15 minutes. They have gotten more attentive when packing it up as well. They write the names of the rolls on top of the sauces so you know what goes to what.
I love Sean's Hand Roll, Palm Springs roll, etc. The poke is always good as well.
I know the whole \"we'll charge you for uneaten rolls\" concept when you go to AYCE but the additional $10 charge for the uneaten (and taken home) roll was pretty outrageous in my opinion. The service that day wasn't the best either. I had to order an additional roll from another waitress because ours had stopped paying attention to us."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times. And the sushi is always great! AYCE price went up but still not too bad. The only down fall is the service. Sometimes you go and the servers never check on you. Other times you go and you get bombarded by servers. Which can be so overwhelming. I don't need to be asked 4 times in 5 minutes if I want to order more. I wish the servers would work on their communication on who's on what table. Overall though I will continue to come here because this is a great sushi place!"}
{"text":"We came here last Saturday and it was the worst service ever. First let's start by pricing on the AYCE. It was 26 dollar and it wasn't even the whole menu like other sushi restaurants. It was a specific menu that doesn't even have half the specials rolls the restaurant menu has so its very limited to the rolls that probably didn't have that many ingredient. Next, there was only one server that is taking plates out to the all tables other than the bar. The next thing that I ran into was this place didn't offer half rolls. He mentioned that most rolls were going to be 6-8 pieces but half were rolls we're not allowed. I ordered ribeye and it came out cold. What also can't out cold was the baked mussel. Not only was it cold my fresh oyster only came two per plate when it was really suppose to be 3 per plate. The food took forever to come out and hen it finally did come to our table all the other plates were empty. That's how long it took. I would never come back here especially for what I paid."}
{"text":"Service was awful. I had previously given this place a 5 so I could get a little cat."}
{"text":"I came here for the AYCE and man it was delicious. I tried the shrimp tempura roll, the shrimp killer, crazy girl, and this king of ocean? roll and they did not disappoint. When I first bit into each of them, it was a piece of heaven I was biting into. It was amazing. The food was fresh, hot, and fast service. The bus boy was always making sure we had our drinks right and if we needed anything else so that was nice. The actual waiter messed up on about 3 orders but no harm done. I would def recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"New favorite AYCE sushi fusion. Great portion so you can try different rolls. Ambiance and  Staff were all great especially our server, Way. He recommended good and popular in menu. Will definitely come back. Thanks to our friend that recommended this place"}
{"text":"Great sushi, fairly priced and the new menu has some really great options. I love coming here for all you can eat sushi with my friends. The staff and chefs are very friendly and happy to answer any questions you have."}
{"text":"Idk what the hype on this place is all about. It isn't over the top like I expected. The service here is okay and so is the food. They have all you can eat options here which was pricy for what they have to offer. Personally, I think you can get your money's worth at other places in Vegas for better prices and better food too. It's located near the smiths in Aliante and by the library. However it was the closest option I had when I wanted sushi. I wasn't satisfied leaving and felt what they offered was just average. But they have stamp cards here which is a bonus. I think the salad was the best thing I ate when I came here which eh isn't something I went to a sushi place for."}
{"text":"We come here all the time! The sushi is always amazing! We always get the all you can eat and they typically have weekly specials which is always nice. There are plenty of items and rolls to choose from as well."}
{"text":"This place has extraordinary food and service; however, the atmosphere is what settled the deal for our amazing dining experience. It's a great place if you are in the mood for sushi and want to have a good time.  Jonathan was the best waiter I've ever had! Thanks again for the awesome service!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent, got me into sushi. The servers are really great and attentive! Definitely one of my favorite restaurants, love all the obscure music videos and performances playing in the background lol"}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this place is the ability to order half rolls! Able to try out more of the rolls that way and not have to force yourself to eat 8 pieces of something you're not sure you'll like or not. Staff is very friendly and gave several recommendations after we told them it was our first time there. My favorite roll was the orange blossom! I also like that you're able to order hot foods as part of the AYCE too--gyoza, kalbi, ramen, fried rice, etc. Lastly a punch card so that your 11th AYCE is free--hooray!"}
{"text":"To all my fellow yelps check in here and get a complimentary small hot saki or a pint of draft beer. This is one of the best all you can eat sushi places I've been too. The entire menu (minus the sashimi section) is free game for all you can eat. 

The sushi is pretty good quality. They have an amazing selection of various sushi rolls, appetizers and other Asian cuisines. 

The menu is the most helpful menu I've ever laid eyes on. Each sushi roll is listed with what is inside, on top and the sauces over them. This makes it easier to order food that you like confidentiality. 

The service was impeccable. Our waitress was extremely helpful and nice. If it was based on service alone they would get 5 stars! 

The layout and atmosphere of this establishment is very modern. They have music videos playing so it tends to get a little noisy at times. I wouldn't suggest going here on a first date or if you're planning anything intimate. 

Usually this smaller restaurant fills up quick so expect to wait for a table. However this isn't the case all the time.

They also deliver with bite squad and gave every customer a $5 off coupon. 

Tip: If you're getting the all you can eat get the half orders (4 pieces) so you can try a wider variety of items. Also, the green stuff they give you isn't guacamole! Haha."}
{"text":"Love to come here with my two boys and friends. Always a great atmosphere and the food is amazballz!!!"}
{"text":"Go here everything I go out for all you can eat. Great prices! Customer service kind of lacks, they always seem to be short staffed and always bring the wrong rolls to my table. But food is overall good."}
{"text":"I was excited to come here because I love the Kaizen near Hard Rock. I was hugely disappointed. The rolls weren't as good even though they were technically the same roll, but the biggest issue I had was the filth of the place. The table was sticky when we sat down and we asked if they could wipe it down, they used the same nasty towel and it did no good. We were also seated up on the little platform and there is a space between the tables and the window was DISGUSTING, it was caked in dust, old food, and grease. The table next to us when we sat had someone eating at it, once they left not only did they not clear the table but all the other servers started piling dirty dishes from other tables on it. We were staring at a table full of gross plates from everyone else while trying to enjoy our meal. When the busser finally came to clear it he took the plates off, never wiped it down, and just reset it. WE WILL NOT BE GOING BACK."}
{"text":"The fish seemed fresh but the rice was undercooked or at the very least overly toothy. That's got to be a cardinal sin of some sort. Service was friendly, however and the atmosphere cozy."}
{"text":"Great food very fast service! Friendly and patient staff! Food was very fresh and the menu is amazing! You must try the green mussels!"}
{"text":"I was driving up Eastern looking for a sushi joint that I have never eaten at. We ended up going to Kaizen expecting a sushi joint with all you can eat (they recently do have it now).

We got in just in time for Happy Hour. Many of their rolls are half price and they also have the option to include brown rice! 

We still order to go periodically and have yet to eat their AYCE. I highly suggest coming here to try their spicy tuna roll with brown rice."}
{"text":"I would normally give this place a 5 star rating.... how ever yesterday the service and quality caught me off guard.  My friends and I love sushi and we are always arguing which one to go to. I 100% of the time say let's go to Kaizen and normally get my way.  So when we arrived it wasn't busy at all.  It was picking up cause we got there right around 4:45pm for the AYCE dinner special.  I placed my order and then did my friend.  Surprisingly my friends rolls kept coming out and none of mine had.  Finally 1 of the 4 I ordered came out at this time my friend was being served his last roll that he ordered.  I inquired about mine and they said they are coming.. keep in mind at least (30 min) has passed since ordering.  Finally 2 of my other rolls came out and still missing 1 more roll.  I enjoyed what was made how ever it was the most sloppiest made roll and you could tell they were thrown together cause they forgot to make them.  As I am finishing what was brought to me our waitress cute white girl with tattoos who was friendly asked if we wanted dessert. I explained I'm still missing 1 more roll.  She peeked over the sushi bar and looked at me and I just said never mind. My friend ordered dessert and we asked for our checks.  Knowing my frustration and lack of service nothing was done to rectify below par service we received yesterday.  I've always loved this place but if yesterday's service / food was any indication of the future this place is a sinking ship :("}
{"text":"Good little sushi spot! I'd recommend it to anyone looking to chow down on some sushi"}
{"text":"Upon walking into this sleek establishment, the first thing one notices is the placement of the sushi bar at the center of the restaurant, where all can observe the chef at work.  Perhaps it was the understated but self-assured way I was acknowledged from the head sushi chef upon walking in, but I just had an immediate strong impression that I would be well taken care of, and my instincts were not off.  

Call me a traditionalist, but I haven't fully embraced the trend for sushi that is overdressed with multiple types of fish and lathered with bold sauces (am I the only person who finds the term \"orgasm sauce\" to sound completely unappetizing?!) since sushi is a celebration of the intrinsic flavor of the fish, and the former style can often mask or compensate for mediocre sushi.   Therefore, I went with some traditional sushi rather than go for the combination rolls (although ones which stood out upon perusing the menu was a tuna roll with mango topped with salmon and a king crab/lobster roll wrapped in halibut).  They have a special menu near the back pages that offer \"half-priced\" sushi all the time (makes me wonder when it is full price) but semantics aside, I received a reasonable deal with 2 pieces each of red snapper, yellow-tail, halibut, yellow tail belly, and sweet shrimp for less than 20 bucks.  

All the fish were extremely fresh and the chef does a good job with proportioning the fish/rice ratio.  The stars for me were the sweet shrimp and the yellowtail belly.  The sweet shrimp has a velvety sweet texture and it slips right off the slightest bit of tail left on probably for aesthetics.  The two pieces are also served alongside two perfectly deep-fried shrimp heads which makes it seem like a 4 piece order.  This additional bonus piece was an unexpected bite of heaven since it was like combining the most perfect shrimp chip, soft shell crab, and the innards of regular crab all into one glorious fusion of texture and flavor.  There was also something primal about being able to devour the whole thing since it appears as though it would not be digestable based on appearance alone.

The tell-tale sign that I would return was upon being served the yellow-tail belly.  The server presented me with some yellow-tail belly that had been diced into 8-9 pieces and apologized that the chef was down to a portion that was not able to be fashioned into a nigiri, but just received a fresh shipment that he would serve on the house if I was willing to wait an extra 15 minutes (I should mention both portions were excellent).   The fact that I received a double portion and the chef's insistence that I get the freshest cut of his fish at no additional charge  speaks highly on his craft and loyalty towards his patrons.  The meal concluded with an artistic palate cleanser of an orange served with the skin off and sectioned inside it's rind which probably took an additional 5-10 minutes to prepare versus cutting them into simple wedges, but sometimes little touches go a long way."}
{"text":"tldr

Repeat customers and never have a bad time here. The sushi chef's at the bar are awesome and are always asking if you want any rolls made. Bottom line - it's fairly priced, fresh, and right down the street.

Got:
-energy roll; eel and yellowtail paired with smelt egg, my new favorite
-crispy soft shell crab; great tasting and paired with mashed sweet potato"}
{"text":"Sushi is always spot on and I really appreciate that they don't charge for my toddlers when I share my all you can eat sushi with them. It's rare to find a place that is so family friendly. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the service is usually pretty slow, sometimes without reason."}
{"text":"My first time here and it was beyond delicious. The service is pretty good for an AYCE sushi place, and the atmosphere is quite nice. Decent amount of tables and places to sit at the bar and the music is lively as well.

One thing I love is that the menu is pretty extensive. Many different types of rolls! There's even sweet rolls that have strawberries and bananas to fill your sweet craving while eating nigiri and sushi rolls. :)

Here's the best part for people who enjoy dessert: AYCE lets you have as much dessert at the end as you want. (At least it seemed that way we each ordered 4 different types ). Try the mini honey toast and the green tea creme brûlée (along with the green tea deep fried ice cream and Mochi ice creams) ! So delicious and some are different from other desserts that you can get at other sushi restaurants!"}
{"text":"Mixed emotions about this place.  The rolls are delicious.  The sushi chefs are super quick!  I like that they offer half rolls, so you can sample more rolls and not get full.  They have a nice variety of appetizers to choose from. 

My biggest downfall is service.  Service is terrrrrible unless you sit at the bar and get straight service from the chefs."}

{"text":"We ordered the all you can eat. I was expecting to fill my stomach with a nice variety of tasty fish. Instead what I got was a large fistful of rice per roll with some fish in it about the size of a nickel. They say that rice is part of sushi and you have to eat or they'll charge. What they don't tell you is that each roll is 99% rice!  I understand they don't want to waste food but I find it unfair that they try to fill you up with rice!!! I know most ayce sushi places do this to some degree,  but this was just ridiculous. Will not be coming back.  Would not recommend. The only reason this gets two stars and not one is that sashimi platter of which you can only order one."}
{"text":"Never been here before... Wanted sushi at 11 that was not on the strip. so I was giving this place a try with my best friend since it had 4 stars. I should of checked the reviews before coming. 

My experience - there were 3 tables with more than 2 people when we walked in. It's also a Tuesday and late. Not expecting it to be busy. The service was good that's why I'm giving it 2 stars not 1. The quality of the fish was sort of chunky, previously frozen for a decade, and not fresh at all. I would not return here because the sushi was gross.  It's not the chefs fault, it's where they are buying their fish."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places in town that still does all you can eat decently. They have a stamp card too. I love their shiitake mushroom roll and it is one of the reasons we eat there a lot. They are really great with Kids and bigger parties. My family enjoys their Bento boxes as well as sushi. Sometimes their delivery sushi doesn't seem as fresh so I only get cooked rolls if we order take out."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  You get hot saki or draft beer when you write a yelp review. More places should embrace the power of yelp!  I'm a foodie and love finding new restaurants.  If I like A place I try to share it with my family and friends.  I want them to experience what I did and want the establishment to be successful so that I can eat there again.  Yelp gives me away to reach more than just family and friends. I get to let them know if a place rocks or if it's not good.  I'm happy to say that Kaizen ROCKS!  Greatness in ever corner!  We were a groups of there and ordered a plathora of things to share.  Our friend was on a low carb diet so we ordered sashimi, the Hawaiian roll, salmon collar and some hot saki.  Everything was delicious, fresh and prepared to perfection.  The crispy parts around the edges of the salmon collar were mouth watering.  I would eat here again. Thank you for a good time and great meal."}
{"text":"Great Food and great atmosphere , service is spot on ! Value is super as my hubby and our 2 kids can eat just about anything and we all love the fresh options !!"}
{"text":"Umm Yeah! Kaizen on Paradise Road is by far my favorite sushi restaurant of all time, so I knew this wouldn't let us down. SUPER big points for the AYCE Menu! Paradise doesn't offer that, and this location is in Henderson! YAY!

I posted a picture with my check in, we ordered Baked green mussels, oysters on the half shell, fatty tuna, yellow tail, yum yum scallop nigiri, & my favorite, ikura.. to start. Everything was perfect. I love when a good AYCE offers oysters on the half. They limit it to one order per person-- that's understandable... because I would order 50 =-) 

We like spicy food, so if you do I HIGHLY recommend the Salmon Killer, and the kiss of fire rolls. For those that aren't a fan of fire, Try the O roll, snow white, their Hawaiian roll. They will add or remove any ingredients you request. Personally, I'm not a fan of asparagus in sushi, so they substituted it in of the rolls for Japanese pickled veggies. 

The perks of this restaurant is that there's no rules to their AYCE. They let you swap sauces, customize rolls and order half rolls. I think my sushi dream has come true. 

The service was nice, our waitress was friendly and told us we can order however we want as long as we don't waste food (No worries there!) 

The fish, just like their other location, is uberly fresh. The AYCE price is $24 after 9PM, on Fridays & Saturdays you get either a FREE sake or beer per AYCE order. 

Happy Sushi-ing =-)"}
{"text":"Can you say incompetence? I came here with a group of friends one Friday night and it was a terrible way to start the weekend! The service was fishy at best. I don't know if it was a language barrier or what but they messed up on every single one of our orders.  When our food finally arrived they said it was time for our group to leave because we had \"exceeded\" our time limit. Are you kidding me exceeded our time limit?! We wouldn't have exceeded our time limit if you had gotten one of our orders right! with so many better options for sushi in this area, its a wonder this place is still in business."}
{"text":"Great place to have lunch with a friend and have a conversation =).
The place is nice inside, although this is not the first time I have been or ever eaten at this place, this is the FIRST time for me to eat here rather than taking my food to go. 

The place has a nice ambiance and very contemporary style, simple, yet elegant feel. I bet this place is nice at night. (ooh an idea for the next time i come here with a friend).

I had the spicy crab maki roll, the breaded scallop maki roll, seared ahi tuna sushi, and yellowtail sushi. We both had the salmon teriyaki bento boxes with came with miso soup, salad with ginger sesame dressing, veggie tempura with gyoza, white rice, and 2 pieces of 3 oz teriyaki salmon.

Overall, this place was great and did not disappoint!

They're sushi and maki rolls are 50% off if you order 2. Their minimum is 2 to get the promo."}
{"text":"Some of the freshest fish money can buy, and reasonable prices too.  I was in Vegas on vacation from Seattle home of some of the freshest sushi around.  Kaizen is excellent."}
{"text":"Food was great but I gave a two star because the service could've been better. Waited for a long time. Our one hour dinner turned into three hours because that's how slow the server was."}
{"text":"Went there for 1st time last week by driving by. Venue is cute & liked the sushi I ordered. I'm on a low to no Carb diet so that fact that they had so much \"NO Rice\" specialty sushi roll selections was great for me. My favorite was their Rose roll. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I love their all you can eat sushi. Always our date night!  We love it there!

Get the tuna apps, you get one for every all you can eat order. They are the best part!   They have wine specials that are always good!"}
{"text":"This is the third time my wife and I have been here in the past few months, each time for AYCE.  The hot and cold \"tapas\" or appetizers are bland - the pork belly was overcooked and tough, the tuna poke salad was a small serving and bland, and the salad my wife ordered had no dressing.  I do like the sushi rolls and the variety - we have tried various different rolls and they taste fresh.

However, the service is awful.  They are understaffed and when you try and catch a waiter/waitress as they run by your table to the kitchen or to another table, they stop and look at you as if they are doing you a service.  One thing I asked for (a fork, not that difficult) last night never arrived.  The other thing is be prepared to be there a long time.  Last night it took 40 minutes before one of our rolls arrived.  Each of the other two times we were there over an hour and our sushi took forever to arrive.  

There are too many other good AYCE sushi restaurants in Las Vegas to go here and be frustrated with the service."}
{"text":"My third time here. First bad experience with the beef and broccoli. It was very tough. I'm not sure what cut of meat they use but it was terrible. The sashimi was fair but cut super thin. My expectations weren't very high considering it was $13 for lunch. I'll come back again but will pass on the beef and broccoli."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for many years and I assure you, Kaizen is the BEST PLACE IN VEGAS FOR AYCE SUSHI. 

The quality of food here is actually too good to be true, and too good to be AYCE. The thick cuts and perfect fish-to-rice ratio are on point. Their menus, from appetizers to desserts, are many, fun, and well-made.

*TIP 1: GET THE STAMP CARD! 11th visit is free.

**TIP 2: Check out the Catch of the Day menu for daily specials! (Included with AYCE)

Would highly recommend the skewers, oysters, and clam miso soup for appetizers. Super white tuna, salmon, and sweet shrimp are always safe bets. ALL, every single one, of the desserts are worth a try. They will have GREEN TEA CHEESECAKE at times and you will have to get it (please).

Bottom line: Their quality of food has been consistently great for years and across the week, the ambience of the place is amazing for any occasion, and the servers and the owner are very friendly. Kaizen deserves all the attention it gets."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my all time favorite sushi places! I have yet to try a roll/appetizer I did not like! Love that you have the option to do half and full rolls. Service is always great. Dakota is the best!! 10/10 will for sure continue to dine here."}
{"text":"Hands down the best AYCE sushi restaurant in Vegas! Service is fast and great, and the sushi rolls are very tasty. The quality of the fish is also fresh and honestly, the sushi chefs puts decent amount of rice compared to other sushi restaurants where they would put massive amounts of rice so customers can get full fast. They also have a salad bar where you can self serve yourself. The rolls are very neatly and well presented and worth taking pictures for and sharing online and ultimately delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious and pretty fees for being in the desert! 

Thanks guys for doing it right. Cold sake to wash it down is just perfect."}
{"text":"I just found Kaizen recently and am pretty impressed!  The food here is great and all you can eat menu costs about 25 dollars a person.  All of the rolls are high quality and taste very fresh.  I can't remember my favorites off the top of my head but will update when I return again (which I definitely will)"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. We went with a group - definitely recommend making a reservation because it gets crowded quick. We did the 'all you can eat' menu - it is reasonable ($23 for lunch / $28 for dinner) considering everything you can order. Our waitress was very friendly and happy to take our orders each time for 'more'. The sushi was fresh, everything tasted great. The all you can eat made it easy to try new items I wouldn't have necessarily ordered. The jalapeno poppers are a must try! Bring your friends and a big appetite."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Vegas and great service,  always a great experience. We always come here for special occasions like birthdays or anniversaries. The place is always warm and welcoming. The staff is always friendly.  The food does take some time to prepare but it's just more time to enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Whether for lunch or dinner, all you can eat is the best option.

All the rolls were delicious and authentic. Atmosphere is great - quiet and a little dark. Service is surprisingly fast. And they don't judge you when you order four desserts :)"}
{"text":"Got bad diarrhea after eating here. Ordered some ngiri Super white. TASTED AWFUL. EXPIRED FISH. Ordered fresh Salmon roll. Was not fresh at all. The chefs either can't tell if the food is no good or they're trying to save a buck. Even their ice cream tempura was bland. The vanilla was watered down, it didn't even taste like vanilla. More like a taste-less cream paste. Don't eat here.. No Bueno!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The cast from our show comes here at least once a week. Their AYCE menu is awesome. Get a punch card! So much to choose from. I always get the Peach Sake... Buy one get one during happy hour - this includes bottles! Hallelujah!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I heard that the sushi was amazing so went the other day to try it out ourselves. We both got ayce and was definitely was great. We tried a little bit of everything. It was our first time so we were a little bit confused with the menu but one of the younger ladies gladly explained it when we ask. My only complaint is that most of the other ladies seemed annoyed whenever we would ask to order another roll. The servers seemed upset at each other when talking by the door where we were seated and made it a little uncomfortable. So overall the sushi was great but the customer service was okay."}
{"text":"I am standing outside as we speak, waiting for my husband to pay. No desert, there was no way I was waiting, and our waitress seemed like she was done for the night anyway.

The service was horrible!!  Our waitress started out fine, then half way through our meal abandoned us, would not even make eye contact. I guess we were too much trouble for her. The table of six, that just got seated got all her attention. Had to get a different waitress to bring the check. 

Had to flag down a busboy to order another beer. I usually way over tip, but I told my husband I would disown him if he left a tip. Ruined our date night. SO disappointed!  15 minutes into the dinner I thought we'd found out new favorite place. :(

The restaurant is smaller than I thought, and all the hard surfaces echo all the noise. It became too much to handle, thus, I wait outside. 

I tend to avoid crab mix, Because I. do not like mayo. Actually, I loathe it. So when we ordered two rolls that did not list crab mix, I was disappointed that they were both loaded with crab mix and mayonnaise. The only thing I tasted was mayonnaise. More mayo than a tuna sandwich. Wtf?

Will NEVER go back. There are too many good restaurants in the area. 

I'm so disappointed because I was lovin it! The salmon collar and the soft shell crab sweet potato appetizer were delicious."}
{"text":"Sushi was fresh and yummy! Service started off fast but did end a little slow. Environment  was clean and cool. I will def return!"}
{"text":"This review is about operations, not food. 

I've made not one, but TWO attempts to eat at this restaurant and have been turned away both times. Even though their posted hours say they are open and I showed up before the alleged \"last call\". 

Obviously I won't try a third time. Change your hours if you're going to close early every night or refuse business because you don't feel like staying open. 

Last night we walked from our house, we live close by. It was cold and started to rain. We walked in about 11:24pm and the employees working said they were closed and looked like they were on their way out the door. I told them that their hours on Yelp said they were open until midnight to which they responded that the kitchen did last call at 11:30pm, to which I responded it wasn't 11:30pm yet. 

Is there a \"last call\" for the last call that I don't know about? Doesn't last call mean you need to order by 11:30pm? Not 5 minutes before? 

I'm annoyed. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, and I won't be visiting your establishment again."}
{"text":"Definitely our new sushi AYCE spot! We were in love with this place before they were AYCE and only went here for special occasions...but now that it's AYCE we're in heaven! We'd go to sushi everyday if we could. Fish is fresh, service is good too, desserts are so much better than most standard AYCE places. 

All nigiri sushi is a must.
Snow White roll is probably the only roll we get (half roll) since we only eat nigiri and apps.
Oysters are fresh and yummy too
Dynamite is actually really good too
Love love the baked mussels 
And a must have is their tempura or deep fried cheesecake (hubby ordered 2, he wished it was bigger) 

Mmmm!"}
{"text":"there are many good AYCE sushi places.

this one is one of them.

also they have really good side menus on top of it.

actually this is my favorite AYCE sushi place since last month."}
{"text":"Sushi was alright, the place is small and the waiting area is even smaller. My friend and I waited about 45 minutes to be seated. The hostess was running around bussing tables trying to seat everybody while the bussers were nowhere to be seen."}
{"text":"Probably the only decent sushi joint on the northwest side of town.

We came here for dinner at 745 pm. We ordered right away (we were hangry!) We didn't have to wait long before our kitchen dishes and appetizers came out. However, it took about 40-45 minutes before our first Sushi order came out! It took about 6-7 minutes before the next Sushi order came in....pretty disappointing as we came here for SUSHI.

You can see all the other tables get upset as well as some tables that were seated before us weren't even served. 

It was a full house restaurant but I feel the service could have improved."}
{"text":"I used to come to this spot all of the time until I moved to Santa Barbara. You'd think being closer to the ocean means better sushi, think again. The price at Kaizen is unmatched for the quality and taste of food you are getting. And to top it all off its AYCE for only $22 (lunch). 98% of the menu is apart of the AYCE deal so you can order anything from sushi to tapas. The service is great and the restaurant is clean. The sushi chefs are always in a positive up-beat mood which makes for a better dining experience. 

Definitely have not found a sushi establishment comparable to Kaizen anywhere in CA! Keeps me looking forward to visiting Vegas again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Not usually a sushi eater, but my hubby brought me here to give me a great experience. The staff is wonderful and explained everything to me. The food was delicious and I became a convert immediately! Sushi was fresh and the miso soup was the best I've had!"}
{"text":"This place had extremely fast service all the food taste so fresh so happy we came here tonight instead of the Strip !!!"}
{"text":"(Review from 6 months ago, this is the correct location that I'm reviewing for. Not the paradise location)

This place.. I mean what do I say really? Sushi was OK nothing really stand out to me. Typical AYCE, but I feel like there wasn't a lot of selections as other places. I probably only enjoyed the super white tuna. The fusion rolls were so-so. 

Service was a definitely a 2 out of 5! Kinda rude, felt like server was getting irritated with us since we were ordering so much at a time? Assuming we weren't going to finish it all, I mean c'mon it's All You Can Eat.
She forgot a couple of things that we ordered and it wasn't even that busy. 
 
I will not return."}
{"text":"Great reverse happy hour service is great and the sushi chef's are very talented.  Love there rolls."}
{"text":"All u can eat  tends to makes me leary...BUT this spot was too darn good! They make the rolls to order so that made me feel all happy inside! I ate myself sushi-silly!! I enjoyed two appetizers and about 7 rolls (don't judge me). My recommendation is the Hawaiian Roll.  It is one of the best sushi rolls I have ever tried."}
{"text":"My sister spoke so highly of the other location so I was excited to try. The food was great but terrible customer service. Waited 30 minutes for them to tell me they didn't hear part of my order. Asked for extra eel sauce and the waitress walked off and started taking other orders."}
{"text":"So I was staying at the palms place for work again. I have eaten at almost all the places in the palms and so I thought I would venture out. So I walked across the street and made my way into Kaizen. 

The place was pretty empty but it was a Wednesday at about 6PM so I understand why. The place is pretty nice inside with a neat urban but Japanese feel. Sat at the sushi bar and the sushi chef was sooo nice. So there are so many things on the menu that it is hard to choose. All the rolls kind of scared me because I was wondering what the quality of their fish really was due to so many rolls and not so much sushi. 

Ordered sushi of Spanish mackerel and it was very tasty so I thought lets try the sushi. I ordered the Chirashi which is a traditional bowl of sashimi. It was AWESOME!!! I had three pieces of tuna, salmon, octopus, squid. Two pieces of Delicious halibut, Spanish mackerel, shrimp, crab and the kicker yellow tail belly. Topped off with a Japanese mushroom, rice, seaweed and salmon eggs. It was soo good. If you order the Cherish you have to be willing to eat what you get. This bowl is for a true sushi lover. Also it is an awesome deal at only $19.95. Tip: let the sushi chefs make it their way. Don't ask for any substitute. 

Overall a great dining experience. I was by myself and never felt rushed or uncomfortable. 

I hope to be able to come here again. 

YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"My brother takes me here all the time for the all you can eat sushi. I always feel full leaving this place.  I think I've almost tried everything."}
{"text":"Was debating tatchi or here. Choose based off both restaurants past 2 reviews. Boy am i glad we came. Only minus 1 star due to server seating us at a table that had some type of sauce spilled on it and it was super close to a family. Almost would have looked as if we were joining them. Akwaaaaaarrrrrrd. Any being. We moved. We drank. We ate. We bounced. Delish, try it sometime!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for some AYCE tonight.  Had a less than stellar experience.  Fish was drenched in too much sauce, server forgot one of the apps...even after being reminded 2x it finally showed up just before the mochi.

Overall, quality, portions, and service was fine, but nothing great this time.  Don't need to head back there any time soon."}
{"text":"Great service cute clean place but not good food all the sushi was not good at all . The fish was old tasting I just did t like the texture .. Our server was amazing I gave her 30% tip they where great !"}
{"text":"Visited this joint on a Friday night two weeks ago with my companion.  The food was decent and so was the service.  The one thing I am griping about is the owner/manager allowed a customer to bring in a good size pit bull like puppy. If this establishment is willing to violate one health code, what other health code violations take place on the premises.  I can understand if the puppy is a legitimate service dog or seeing eye dog.  This puppy was neither.  I am not going back to this place knowing their disregard for the public health code.  I know most restaurants are not that clean but somethings are best left unknown."}
{"text":"I love that there is finally a great all you can eat sushi restaurant in the Northwest part of the valley! Plus their sushi is amazing."}
{"text":"Adam and Josh made the experience awesome. My wife and I were truly impressed. We came at lunch and the service was fast. Refills on drinks came as needed. A hidden gem for sure. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Since this was a new place I didn't know was to expect. The place is super cute with bench style seating. There's 25% off your entire bill for happy hour! i went with 4 friends and we ordered 6 rolls, two miso soup, two teas, and a garden salad and the bill came out to $63. i think thats a pretty good deal. our server renae was really sweet.

Their very generous with the food portion. We ordered the tiger eye roll Which was my favorite roll out of the 6 rolls we ordered it was deep fried calamari rolled with crab, avocado & cucumber. Also try the Energy Roll!!!! in it there were fresh water eel, yellowtail, yama gobo, green onion & smelt egg. all the rolls were really good and we were stuff after leaving. i wanted to try their fried green tea ice cream but i was way tooo full to order it."}
{"text":"When we're looking for consistently good sushi and friendly, quick service, Kaizen is the best! I've never been disappointed while eating here. It's almost always busy and the servers always have a smile."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time, and thought it wasn't too bad as far as the sushi goes. The lemon salmon sashimi was really good, you are limited to three orders per person, so definitely order the max. With AYCE it's hard to taste the difference between rolls at other sushi places, they all end up tasting similar with some combination of shrimp tempura, avocado, crab, salmon, tuna, etc. overall they were good rolls and half orders are available. They do have a lot to choose from their menu for dinner. I love mushrooms and they have a shiitake mushroom tempura roll, but I did not like it at all, tasted pretty bland and couldn't really taste the mushroom. I really liked their beef tanaki, if you like rare meat you'll like this one.

For the appetizers/hot tapas I tried the calamari tempura, muscles, beef fried rice, edamame, and the miso ramen. The calamari was ok, goyemon/sushi mon have my favorite calamari tempura at a sushi place. Muscles were a bit too fishy for my taste. Beef fried rice was good and the miso ramen tasted like cheap ramen. 

They have unlimited desserts including Creme brûlée And tempura cheesecake. I had the green tea Creme brûlée since they were out of the vanilla, I'm usually not a fan of green tea but this one was very light on the green tea and I really enjoyed it. The tempura cheesecake was pretty good as well, very dense dessert so I recommend sharing this one. 

Service was pretty bad, I would probably rate service a 1 Star. They are very slow, with a group of 5 of us it took us almost 3 hours to get all the orders we wanted. Our server was also rude and didn't appreciate him at all. Also it was very warm inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"The menu prices are a bit expensive individually, but as part of the AYCE deal they're absolutely fantastic. The quality of the food served was above par for the area and the range on the menu was phenomenal. There was a wide selection of rolls free of mayo and cream cheese, which I always count as a plus. There were also reasonable limitations set on certain items. I ate here for lunch and would have loved to have tried some otoro or amaebi nigiri but they were both restricted to dinner, which is fully understandable given the price difference.

The highlights of the meal were the Screaming O salad, surf clam nigiri, and Crazy Girl roll (again, personally would have preferred it without cream cheese, but it was melted and soft and didn't significantly affect the taste).

For dessert, the creme brulee (vanilla) and mochi ice cream (green tea) tasted a bit off, but the scoop of red bean ice cream was some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my AYCE sushi lunch. The fish was tasty and the service was wonderful!!! Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. I had ordered house salad but that salad comes with bento box, but that's not listed in description of box. Had I known I would have ordered something else. Then both shrimp and veggie tempora came without sauce.  Had ordered brown rice instead of white with box but I got white rice instead. Never again, very disappointed."}
{"text":"Came in late light to have dinner and had a pleasant experience. They had this scallop dynamite dish that was mind blowing!! Also try the Kiss of Fire roll. That was my favorite."}
{"text":"I always eat at the Kaizen on Paradise but today I tried this location for the first time and I'm very delighted. I love that that they have all you can eat option and still have all of my favorites available. I definitely will be coming back with my sweetheart."}
{"text":"I love this place!! an awesome lil hang out place with friends, the staff is cool and laidback (not constantly in your face) and it's quiet, not so packed that you get lost in the shuffle."}
{"text":"I can't remember how many times I have come to this restaurant. every time I come here , I get to enjoy delicious food and great customer service with a reasonable price $26.95/ person for all you can eat sushi &sashimi dinner . There is not much rice in the rolls , so you can eat more food. Their sushi and sashimi are very fresh and high quality.
Keep it up !!!"}
{"text":"Read some of the past reviews on here, and it's all about \"waiting.\"
Came here with my mom, and we didn't wait that long to be seated.
We waited probably 15 mins to order... but in their defense it was pretty busy.

I ordered ~
Baked mussels - watery. The sauce dropped off.
Dragon roll (half) -my mom loved.
Miso soup - as an appetizer it would've been our first... but the soup came out probably 30 mins later.

Sashimi- rice = fish 
So the rice portion is big, and the fish is decent size.
I ordered 
Masagox2,sweet eggx2, salmonx2 ,tunax2 , yellowtailx2, eelx2...
They only ended up serving me masago x2, salmonx2 , tunax1, eelx2....
I asked the server about the tamago.... but she told me that it takes awhile... I don't think it should take 40 mins for some sweet egg over rice...?! Or at least let a customer know which rolls/sashimi would take some time to prep...  because I personally did not want to stay 2 hours at a ayce and grab the server 3 times.
Ordered a second dragon roll , because my mom like it.
Asked about the yellow tail , and so the server talked to the chefs.
Waited.
Waited..
I'm already annoyed...
So I flagged down the server , and I told him to canceled the orders... so he tells the chefs , and they shook their head like they didn't have any orders.
Great. Amazing. Spectacular 

On top of that we ordered a chicken katsu togo.
I understand that you guys have different chicken katsu rolls,plates, bowls, and etc ....since the server came off rude ...??
\"Chicken katsu!? Which one?! Bowl?plate?roll?\"
Let me correct the polite way to respond to a customer, because I've been in the restaurant industry for awhile.

\"Chicken katsu? Well we have a choice over rice, as a roll, or as a plate . Which one were you interested in?\" 
*polite voice *

I only saw the \"chicken katsu\" . I know I had a lot of time to read the menu, but I didn't read word by word ...

Anyways....
I think knowing your timing with each table, and following up with a customer on their order is the key to great service.
As packed as it is~~Don't let your mood get in the way on you treat your customer.
As a server you have to get over on what your feeling , and put in your \"kiss your a**\" personality , because some people actually tip based on how you're serving... not how terrible the food is. (Food is okay, so try the place!! Barely any AYCE sushi in  north lv)"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place . Service is good even if they busy . The food good . All u can eat"}
{"text":"This place has an AYCE menu now. I only started coming here after seeing the big sign outside the window. This menu must be fairly new because I've never heard about it before and it was the reason why I decided to finally check out this place.

The AYCE menu is great with lots of quality appetizers, rolls, sashimi, to name a few. I noticed they had a lot of non-seafood items on there in case someone in your party is not really the sushi type. Here are a few items worth trying:

Poke salad- deliciously served on some seaweed salad and a lil on the spicy side. Not too spicy but had a nice kick.
Beef ribs- if you like Korean spareribs, you'll love these. One order per person, understandably so cuz they'd probably lose out if they served unlimited amounts of these.
Snow white roll-shrimp tempura inside topped with yummy whitefish sitting on top of a tart and tangy sauce. Might have been ponzu, now that I think of it.
Dynamite-the usual baked scallops in mayo but their version had big chucks of mushrooms and was covered in cheddar cheese. Very tasty!

I can't remember not liking anything I ordered. Kaizen is def taking place over Sushi Tachi as my AYCE sushi spot in North Town. My only gripe is they don't offer half-rolls like Sushi Tachi. This sucks for me because I dine alone very frequently and this place makes it hard for me to try a lot of different things. If they offered half rolls i can try several different ones without risk of being scolded for not finishing or have to pay for the leftovers. Which I came close to doing the very first time."}
{"text":"The baked salmon roll and Las Vegas roll are the best IMO. 
Tonight we have the place to ourselves so excellent service. Lol
We have come here many times when we have visited Las Vegas  and will come again."}
{"text":"I ordered 5 things.
1) Cucumber octopus salad- it was amazing
2) Miso Ramen- it was alright, until I found a hair on it :(
3) Seafood ramen w/no spice- waiter messed up my order. It came ridiculous spicy, but it was amazing.
4) Vanilla Creme Brûlée-  it was extremely small, they serve is on a ounce cup used to serve sauces.
5) Toramisu- they served it straight out of the freezer.
Overall... I think I caught them on a off day. I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"Not bad. I ordered pickup so I can't exactly speak to the service, and I kept it simple with a Philly roll and California roll, so I can't speak to the other sushi selections. My order was ready to go when I got there and packed with everything I needed. I did like that they used a nice sturdy plastic container as opposed to styrofoam. My one gripe was the asparagus in the Philly, and really that's my fault for not actually reading the description because I could have asked them to leave it out. If I'm craving sushi for lunch again, I'll probably order from Kaizen."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here-what a waste of money. I got the bento box with chicken teriyaki. It seems like a great value but the service was slowwwww. We were literally the only people in the restaurant and yet it took forever. The chicken teriyaki was disgusting. I took maybe three bites just to have something in my stomach before I went back to work. I left the rest and didn't bother taking it to go. I got half a philly roll which was mediocre but at least filled me up a little bit. I pretty much left feeling like I just lost $18 and didn't get anything in return."}
{"text":"Huge selection of different sushi rolls and I loved the ones I tried. I had the sunrise roll and the crazy albacore roll and they were both delicious! Service was very courteous and prompt. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fun fresh and a happening place

Fresh sushi 

The shrimp pancake I a must try and the sweet potato and soft shell crab I could make a meal out of the two"}
{"text":"The food was good, the ambiance was very trendy, the place looked nice, but the service was awkwardly slow.  Overall it is a nice sushi restaurant. When myself friend and I arrived we were the only guests.  We were seated right away, our orders were taken in appropriate time and our food came out fast.  The rest of the time our server was pacing the floor yet not getting that we were ready for the check.  I don't know if he was trying to not rush us out or what but it took way too long to cash out.  We had to stand up to give him the hint that we were ready to leave.  I did like the sushi although I think other restaurants serve more at that price.  The place looked nice, had flashy neon specials signs, funny names for the dishes, and today's hit songs playing in a big screen t.v.  I am not usually in the Henderson area so I probably won't be back but it is a decent restaurant if you are near by."}
{"text":"Uhhhh if I go missing you'll know where to find me! This was seriously like a dream come true to find this place! All you can eat sushi, huge menu to choose from. I swear between the 4 of us we tried everything on the menu and there was only like 2 rolls I didn't like. We had 14 orders of mochi ice cream! Because of us they may have had to place another order of fish and ice cream for the dinner crowd. As if you didn't already know being that it is a sushi place do not order the steak meal! Anyway back to the sushi holy moly I'll be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"We have been loyal customers for years. The quality at this restaurant has been declining for a while but now on top of the quality being complete crap, the bathroom smells like sewer sludge and they're still having guests use it. I couldn't even bare to wash my hands. How is this place operational? It needs to be shut down. There are way better AYCE places. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh sushi, awesome presentation, good environment and great attentive staff. Definitely will be back again. Thanks to Yelp reviews for this restaurant, we have a great new place for sushi without traveling 20 minutes away!"}
{"text":"I just came out of a food coma after dining at Kaizen Fusion.  This is a great option for AYCE sushi if you're HUNGRY!  The variety is great, the service is wonderful and the is very restaurant clean.  I am a mother of three, one teen and two tweens and boy can they EAT!  Things you should know before you go...Dinner pricing begins at 4pm, kids over 10 are charged as an adult, drinks are not part of the AYCE menu however dessert is and they give you a 90 minute timeline to eat!!  My favorite items were the Orange Blossom, the Rock and Roll, the Caterpillar Roll, the Monkey Brains and the Avocado Train.  Although I'm not a big AYCE fan, my kids ARE so I will keep Kaizen in our AYCE sushi rotation."}
{"text":"First time I ever came here it was pretty good. Last two times I've been here DISGUSTING.. the fish is not even real, all their food is artificial meat and everything. Took them 20 minutes just to take our order wasn't even busy at all had a few tables and that's it. I will never come here again. I'm feeling sick just from thinking about it."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi places, I love their rolls here. I usually do the all you can eat, and they offer a punch card. The service is a little, meh, but the sushi is only reason I come here."}
{"text":"Goodness! Sushi melts in your mouth. Servers were courteous. Very busy but they kept it together!"}
{"text":"Food at Kaizen is exceptional. The tempura roll selection in particular was outstanding. The staff was very pleasant and overall we were very impressed with the atmosphere. They also feature an amazing AYCE menu. However, when the two of us arrived we were seated 40 minutes later which isn't much of an inconvenience being a restaurant and all. That being said we were seated and were asked to place our orders only to wait 1 hour until we received our FIRST order. After someone finally gave us the light of day they asked us if we wanted to order more and of course being AYCE a couple orders of Sushi Nigiri and 3 Tempura rolls isn't justified to be charged $28 per person. I don't have any idea why but our second order took just as long if not longer. Guys this is not complicated. It's fish on rice. I've worked in food for a while. I want to give the benefit of the doubt but honestly there were hardly any customers in the restaurant towards the second half while we were there. I've never really had a bad experience with most of the sushi spots here in Las Vegas but this one was a bit over the top. All I really have to say to the newest customer is to not come hungry and expect to spend at the very least 3 hours while you're here."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!! The service here was so awful and the workers besides like two were extremely rude! One girl named Ann and I think Ingrid were so rude and Ann flipped her hair and gave us attitude when we asked for a refill 45 minutes after being there. When we asked to see a manager she replied with attitude \"she's not here call back at 4 tomorrow\" oh trust me all three of us are calling. The food was good and my girls and I had a good time because of our own selves. Everyone at sushi bar was nice and so was our server who's name I forgot. 

Update: Came here with my boyfriend and once again the service was absolutely terrible. To think I would come back here and give it another chance I still left disappointed. All I have to say is if you don't mind waiting 30 minutes for every roll you order than this is your place!"}
{"text":"Was carving for a late night sushi. I called Kaizen at 11:20 they confirmed that they closed at 1:00am, got there at 11:40 to my surprise the server said they stop serving at 12:00. They is no way to eat a all you can eat in less then 20 min. Very frustrated and irritated with such a disrespect!"}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had at an AYCE place. They literally had one waiter running around to all the tables as the manager \"helped\" out every once in a while; simply removing a plate or two from the tables. The buss girl came by 3 different times to every 1 time our server made it around. We were so tired of waiting to order, we started asking the buss girl to take our order- she was not allowed to. The food was mediocre at least. Not worth the headache..."}
{"text":"In my opinion the best sushi spot in town! Fresh fish, great service. The quality is great for the price and the atmosphere is away from the strip"}
{"text":"Location is a bit strange, had an excellent spicy tuna salad.  Fried crab was terrible.  Music is waaaaaay too loud and doesn't go with an Asian theme.  Had to eat and run because the  volume on music was just too loud and annoying.  Went to the one in Henderson and it blows this location away."}
{"text":"Service was pretty solid and the fish was generally of decent quality... but my heavens do I hate the new 'trend' of drowning sushi in sauces and juices etc.  If you're proud of your fish you don't need to cover it in a spicy mango Japanese salsa mixed with eel sauce and mustard or etc etc etc..."}
{"text":"It's an all you can eat buffet the servers are super nice great food, not expensive at all recommended to anyone we love sushi and very picky so this place is really good"}
{"text":"The best example of an AYCE sushi spot. This place has it all worked out. Servers do not try to slow your experience down..its eat till you tap out. Quality of product is very high for what it is. 

Menu is not choked out by restrictions, matter of fact it has one of the most open AYCE menus in town. Not alot of restrictions. Hats of to Daniel and the crew for preparing a leveled range of delectable options at a more than fair price. I've eaten everywhere in town and this place is top notch! All hail KAIZEN SUSHI!"}
{"text":"Ate here last night. .. ordered 2 full size sushi rolls. It was very appetizing...taste very fresh. The decor is very modern & although we didn't sit at the bar, I noticed the sushi chefs were totally engaging in conversation with their guests. I love that.  Can't wait to go back. ....today. ...lol"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with food and service. I don't have high hope and food is average. Ramen was lukewarm. Rice of California roll was cold. Octopus was already chipped on the side - sign of not fresh. 
But more than food I disappointed on the waiters really. Also I lost appetite at the beginning when I saw this cracks on my bowl of ramen. Even staffs who were eating next to our table had better bowls."}
{"text":"This is our favorite AYCE sushi restaurant!! Good service and amazing food. I love the toro, yellowtail belly and uni nigiri. The salmon sashimi is awesome! My husband loves their spicy rainbow roll. You can order custom rolls and get unlimited desserts (most places only allow one dessert per person.) We love the stamp card too! Buy 10, get one lunch or dinner for FREE!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite AYCE sushi places! The rolls are always fresh and delicious. My favorites are the Orange Blossom Roll & the Rock and Roll and of course Mochi for dessert. There is so much included with the AYCE option - appetizers, soups, salads, tons of rolls, sashimi and dessert. The restaurant itself has a great atmosphere and they play music videos on a projector screen. The service has always been fast for me. Will definitely recommend and visit again."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite all you can eat sushi restaurant currently. They even have oysters, which were amazing. With places like sushi kaya getting a C grade, I started to branch out for sushi places and I'm glad I did. I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I love this outpost of Kaizen Sushi.  I haven't tried the others yet.  We've been here before and each time the experience gets better.  The food is always good.  Recently we started sitting at the bar and once you get those chefs a Sapporo, it's on!  Alex and Han are making some good rolls!  Also, my favorite is the Seared Albacore with Crispy Onions.  Sooo yummy."}
{"text":"The food is great but the sushi pieces are extremely small...I wouldn't come back here only because I know I would leave hungry still. But I mean it's pretty good try it out. Prices are the same as other sushi places just smaller portion of food, yeah no thanks lol."}
{"text":"This PLACE GUYS!!! The best AYCE sushi spot in the Silverado Ranch/Seven Hills area! I feel like before this place, I had a hard time finding a sushi place in the area that had good service and good sushi and I FOUND IT! 
The atmosphere is definitely relaxed, calm but still fun. The staff here was incredible, friendly and good at their job. We got our food in a timely manner, refills every time we needed one, and nothing was messed up. The sushi menu has the basics and their house rolls that are great and creative. 
Give this place a try if you're still looking for a place around here that never disappoints."}
{"text":"Nice place ,the server wade was a polite and informative cool guy ,great place,cool atmosphere"}
{"text":"I'm beginning to think service is just not something sushi bars excel at..it's hard to explain they checked on me plenty of times she just seemed put out that I was there. The sushi was good. I love eel sauce and theirs is one of the better ones I've had. Mochi was yummy. I wish I could find a sushi place that understood kids dont want all the extras..keep it simple."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and this place is amazing!! Great selection and service. Cindy was our server and she rocked it!!"}
{"text":"Straying away from AYCE and onto their ramen section on their regular menu was a regrettable move.

There are certain ramen bowls that can be ordered from the AYCE menu, except for the seafood ramen that you'll have to shell out $13 for. My boyfriend and I were both wavering on whether or not to order two bowls, considering AYCE is a better deal. However, our waiter *really* sold us, claiming it was one of the \"best in town.\" He even went so far as to put down other ramen restaurants in the Valley, referring to one that my boyfriend and I occasionally go to as serving \"nasty broth\" -- way to go on insulting the customers! 

With such bold statements, we just had to find out if it really was worth the time, calories, and cash. 

Seafood Ramen ($13) - All broth and hardly any noodles and seafood. The broth was essentially red, mildly-spicy water with random chunks and bits of seafood floating in it. The choice of seafood is questionable -- Salmon and ramen together is a terrible, disgusting combination.

Verdict: For a ramen fix, I'll just make the trek to my favorite ramen restaurants in Chinatown, especially the one that serves the \"nasty broth.\""}
{"text":"Been going here for three years and I have to say , I will no longer be going here. I do not know if their is new management or what? Same sushi chefs but I do not recognize the servers. There is also a new menu. So they got my order wrong when I took the time to explain and it still came out wrong. I ordered an appetizer on the menu Agedashitofu. The picture shows fried rogue with broccoli and mushrooms. When I got my food there was inky large fried pieces of tofu. I asked the server , this is what I ordered and I showed him the picture . He said and I quote \" that's the picture but it doesn't really come like that \". I said are kidding me , and I d
Said I didn't want it . He looked at me like I was  crazeeee. Im done with that place. It just not the same and that was the icing on the cake for me ."}
{"text":"I had 3 rolls, 2 were good but 1 was too sweet to us. I told them the roll was too sweet and they were upset that I did not like it. My husband had the spicy seafood ramen and that was OK. I unfortunately would not come back. The food and service was not worth the drive!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service was absolutely dreadful. We sat for over two hours and they screwed up our orders. Probably won't be coming back :/"}
{"text":"So this was my first time trying this restaurant and it will certainly be my last. I went in with positive expectations for this place after reading reviews here on yelp. First off my fiancé and I came an hour and a half before closing and were told that we couldn't do the AYCE. We sat down looked at the menu, ordered some drinks and if you're like me and hate tea and sodas you are screwed and will have to suffer with disgusting tasting water. Seriously, no juices or anything... For starters we ordered some gyoza which was nice until we tried what we thought was soy sauce and turned out tasting like pure vinegar. For our main we both had ramen with sushi on the side. I had tonkotsu with California rolls and I have never eaten ramen and sushi so bad. The broth was REALLY salty, the noodles and the pork were super chewy and the Cali rolls tasted so plain. Same with his meal might I add. Also, total mood killer! The music. It might just be me but I don't want to hear \"what does the fox say\" on full blast while I'm eating my dinner... Last thing (I promise) when we left it was about half an hour till closing and I had noticed some of the chefs go out front. To get some fresh air maybe? NOPE! We were greeted with the smell and sight of cigarettes and beer as soon as we stepped outside the front of the restaurant. Disgusting. Great way to show off your restaurant... How this place got best in Vegas I do not know! Don't go here, you will be disappointed like we were."}
{"text":"I've heard A LOT of hype surrounding Kaizen as of late, so I wanted to see if making the long drive out to the Southeast part of town was worth it. 

Supposedly the Southeast location is the only one with AYCE, but I can't confirm this 100%, so I'd call ahead of time if you're planing on dining at their other location. 

Kaizen's space is about average for a sushi place, so if you're visiting during peak hours, be prepared to wait. I went right before dinner time, and got seated immediately. 

Oyshi or Goyemon have been my go-tos for some time, but Kaizen is different. There's something about the quality of the food Kaizen serves that's a cut above the competition, although I can't put my finger on it; everything just tastes better. I typically order the same rolls, and expand into a few new ones, and this is probably some of the best sushi I've ever had! 

The AYCE menu is also quite vast! Kaizen isn't too limiting on what you can or can't have, which added to a more positive experience! Speaking of which, the staff was incredible! Very attentive, picked up plates before they formed a mountain, and not once did I have to ask for a refill! 

It may be an excursion, but if you're willing to make the drive, Kaizen is definitely worth it! I don't get sushi often, but from now on, Kaizen is my #1!"}
{"text":"Very extensive menu for the all you can eat sushi deal. Soups, salads, appetizers, sashimi, sushi, specials rolls, fried rolls, ice cream, etc. The trick is to avoid getting large rolls where you're going to be having a lot of rice. You'll be done after only a few - to get your $26 bucks you've got to be strategic: Sashimi and sushi, and save the beer for later. The chefs are very friendly and the service is quick - they seem to have a lot of regulars which is a good sign - who knows, maybe i'm becoming one. Recommend trying out the lunch all you can eat (5 or so bucks cheaper) first to check the place out and go from there.

I left happy both times. All in all not the best sushi i've had, but it does the trick and is well worth the money."}
{"text":"Best all you can eat sushi in Vegas. Come here whenever we come to Vegas. Excellent service, fresh ingredients and made right in front of you."}
{"text":"First time trying this place with the fam, good service, Daniel was our waiter . Shrimp lover & avocado train was my favorite .."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time. Food is amazing and staff are friendly. Quality of food is great and price is decent. Must go place if you live in Henderson. Much recommended!!"}
{"text":"I tried the Tiger Eye Roll at Kaizen, and it's something I've never seen or eaten before. Pieces of tuna, yellowtail, salmon, a stick of cucumber all wrapped in seaweed and squid(!) with an outer breading. The roll didn't have rice, so you'll be good if avoiding carbs...

Also had the chicken katsu bowl, which was nice and crispy.

Vegas has really good sushi, and the sushi chefs at this restaurant were masters at the craft."}
{"text":"I had sushi from another location I believe pretty close to Hard Rock Cafe and loved it there so I decided to try this location since it is much closer to where I live. It was lesser quality than the other location but mostly still good. Some of the salmon wasn't even pink still (brown). I just took it off cause I didn't want to risk it. But everything else was good. I waited awhile to get it but they were really busy."}
{"text":"First of all the stamp cards are so useful if you eat sushi lots! 10 stamps and you get free all you can eat sushi! Place is nice and clean. The service is super fast and they're all so friendly and nice! ( Makes me feel at home :) food comes fast and everything is so fresh and yummy! I love their creme brûlée for dessert..

Don't get their ice cream though because it tastes... Fake? I don't know how to explain it but it doesn't taste like ice cream even. 

One of my favorite things is that you can order half the rolls or full so four pieces of you just want to taste it and 8 if you want the actual full on ! This is good for trying things the first time so it won't be such a waste :)

Also it's convenient that they close at 1am!"}
{"text":"3/10 would not recommend :(

Quick synopsis:
Service was okay, not the best
& I was not living at all for the sushi

The menu was a million pages long (not really, but there were lots of options). Although this may seem good, I think it really put this restaurant on edge as it made it harder for them to focus on making good quality dishes rather than a multitude of below subpar foods.

First off, the service was quite standard despite the fact that we had about four different servers that night. The first server my table had came off very kindhearted and respectful until we placed our orders. We had AYCE; therefore, we decided to purchase a lot of food in order to get our money's worth. While ordering, it seemed that she made a face full of disgust and disrespect at the fact that we had ordered so much. 
For whatever reason, our first server decided to stop serving us. We were treated with another server who was evidently our savior. She was the nicest, most complimenting waitress anyone could ever ask for. She always came around to ask if we needed anything and never forgot to come back if we had any issues. Honestly, she is one of the reasons that I'm giving this restaurant a chance.
In contrast to this saving light that guided us through the darkness of this restaurant, the clean up crew was not up to my standards. These individuals would always come up out of nowhere to grab our plates--the worst part is that they would surprisingly grab them from in between our party rather than from the open end of the table. Moreover, it was clear that they were rushing us as they constantly came over and watched for the moment we would take the last piece of sushi off the plates. Like a scavenging group of vultures, they had only made our eating experience very intimidating and unprofessional.

Now onto the more important issue, the actual sushi.
Yes, yes, yes, the appetizers and what not were fine and were comparable to other sushi restaurants we've been to around town. But then again, I could be wrong, since we had only ordered two different starter items--this being the short ribs and the cucumber salads. 
The maki rolls were not that tasty and the nigiri was off the charts trash, and I'm not (I repeat not) over exaggerating. 
I'll start off with the nigiri because that's what I'm always looking forward too whenever I go to a sushi bar. The fish was not fresh. I had only gotten the toro, cajun albacore, and uní. I was hoping to order more, by my stomach told me otherwise. Whatever I was served was NOT TORO. That fatty, melty component that toro is known for was not there. To my assessment, it was just a chewy piece of old, fishy tuna. To make the eating experience even worst, both the questionable \"toro\" and the Cajun albacore were seemingly frozen and recently thawed to an extent that made it very noticeable. The uni looked fresh, but you know what they say--looks can be deceiving. That sea urchin was absolutely foul. The nigiri was overall not up to my expectations and im actually shook while im still writing this. Although it was quite nasty, I had to finish it knowing that I would be charged if I didn't consume all of it. 
Now the maki sushi rolls were better. The cooked/baked rolls were tasty, but that may have been because the rolls had all consisted of shrimp tempura, imitation crab, soft shell crab, and other veggies. On the contrary, the rolls with raw fish was below subpar and not fresh. I think it was only edible because of the magnitude of sauces that were doused on each of these rolls. To that extent, they were able to mask the fish's uncanny flavor with the mass amounts of eel sauce, spicy mayo, etc.

The last round of what seemed to be a dreadful dinner was the impending dessert. Oh how excited I was to get something sweet. We had ordered the green tea ice cream, the mini honey toast, and the vanilla creme brûlée. The green tea ice cream was delicious and comparable to many of the ones found at other sushi bars. The honey toast was just a little toasted dinner roll topped with some honey and vanilla ice cream. To say the least, that honey toast didn't reach my expectations, but it was still good. Now, I had ordered the vanilla creme brûlée. Looking at it, it had a nice encrusted sugar topping. As I raised my spoon towards my mouth, I noticed that my dessert was not warm like regular creme brûlée. It was cold, almost like how my heart feels as I'm writing this disheartening review. Overall, the dessert was still delicious and palatable.

Although it could have just been a bad day, I don't think I could risk going back to sushi restaurant that sells bad fish. But if you still disagree with me, I hope you can try this restaurant yourself and tell me otherwise. I was very optimistic about this place seeing these great reviews, but on the other end I finished unsatisfied. 
PS I added some metaphors and small jokes to add levity, but besides that, please take everything I'm writing into consideration"}
{"text":"I love this place i've been coming here for about 2 years now. The food is great the desserts are very creative. I love eating here. Even though there is another sushi place closer i rather go the extra few blocks"}
{"text":"I love this sushi restaurant.  Their AYCE menu is very large and has something for everyone.  The staff is always very friendly and the service is good.  The atmosphere is perfect for my young kids (who love sushi) and we never have to wait very long for a table.  I highly recommend this for sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday with the girlfriend.  It was not very busy right around 4 but picked up shortly thereafter.  We both got the all you can eat (AYCE).  I'm not a sushi fan but she is.  She was pretty impressed with it.  

I got several of the cooked items.  The rib-eye steak and chicken katsu were quite good.  The spare ribs were fine but nothing amazing, the chicken fried rice was merely OK -- every Chinese or Thai restaurant does this a lot better, and the Japanese chopped steak was not very good at all.  I tried to order the tonkatsu (simply called 'don' on the menu) but they were out.  For dessert I tasted a bit of the green tea mochi and it was good, but the tempura cheesecake was really awesome.  

I'm not sure how fast all you can eat sushi places are supposed to be, but the service was slow at times.  Midway through service our waitress disappeared only to be replaced by another one, but we were never told, so when we kept looking for our old waitress to order more things we couldn't find her and only figured it out when the new waitress stopped by to refill water. 

The decor is fine, though I could do without the constant flashing lights on the back wall behind menu boards.  They do give you a punch card so after you purchase 10x AYCE you get a free one.  The price for lunch is around $22 and for dinner is $27, though you can just order a la carte as well.

I'll definitely go back, but maybe only once or twice a month probably."}
{"text":"Over the last 8 years, I have three places that are at least, 4 star or better. I could say taste is everything, but I'd be lying, customer service is #1, followed by taste, price, etc., etc., so on and so on. When deciding between my three top spots, on the real, it usually depends on how many more days till my next pay day. I'm happy to say this place exceeded all of my expectations. The customer service was above par. We were greeted and seated by a hostess, with a smile, our busboy was attentive, and friendly, also with a smile that just put him over the top. The sushi chef was all of those things and more, he paired a couple of bottles of Sake with our meal and returned several times to pour us another, as needed. You might say this is typical or average service, and while I agree, it isn't unheard of, it has been my experience that, \"typical\" is average to mediocre and worse. For a, strip mall sushi joint, at 5:30 on a Tuesday, I felt like a VIP, thank God the food was exceptional. This is #1 on my list of favorites."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. Very fresh and flavorful. The service is excellent as well. We've been there with a large group twice now and both times everyone was very pleased. 
I definitely tried some new things - most of which I liked a lot. That's the benefit of going with a large group. You get to sample some things that you may not order normally. Again, I highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Showed up on Saturday at 2:30pm. The place was fairly busy but we got a table right away. Our drink orders were taken quickly and when the waitress asked of we were ready we asked for just a minute. She came back a few minutes later and took our orders. My wife ordered lunch special and I ordered AYCE (started with 2 half rolls) and we NEVER talked to our waitress again. She NEVER came back to our table. Servers brought out my wife's food. 20+ minutes later my half rolls came. 15 minutes later I gave up. I asked the girl pouring water for the manager, complained, paid and left. 
Sorry, but if I'm eating AYCE I'm not waiting 35 minutes between ordering rolls."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here. I love the all-you-can-eat sushi, the variety, and the freshness of the seafood. I think the prices are fair and the ambience is awesome!"}
{"text":"AYCE. Great selection and good price! Service was great and sushi was great! Love that you can do half rolls or full. The green tea ice cream was a bit to sweet! But other than that was a great experience."}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday night with a close friend. I was skeptical to try this place but it definitely proved me wrong! Pricing was reasonable. I ordered tuna sashimi, miso soup, and half of an Alaskan roll. After browsing the menu, I would definitely come back for AYCE. The fish was fresh and tasted great!"}
{"text":"Giving you guys 3 only bc I drove some way to grab lunch and work online before the gym. A little annoyed that o one cared to fix the problem.  Wifi do not work. Fix it or edit yelp. Spicy tuna crispy rice was a 5
 Scallops and bacona bit burnt so 3. Service was friendly"}
{"text":"outstanding, as always. did the all u can eat, not disappointed. sushi, service and miso all wonderful. thanks gang."}
{"text":"Excellent food, my go to place for sushi and friendly staff.  Always clean and decent prices."}
{"text":"Visited Kaizen today with my daughter and we were very impressed. Dining room is clean, spacious, and modern.  Seaweed salad was very good though it couldve used some sesame oil on it. A \"side\" portion was large enough for us to split as an appetizer.  My daughter ordered the standard California roll - nothing special but the ingredients were fresh. I had the \"twilight\" roll which consisted of fresh water eel, avocado, fried eel, spicy tuna, and a spicy and sweet sauce. Absolutely to die for and very filling since my daughter wouldn't try it. Finished off our lunch with green tea tempura ice cream. Server was attentive but not overbearing. We'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place is a solid three stars. Price was OK and most of the rolls were good. The spicy tuna roll was  not good. The service was about average but the ambience/decor was nice. We went for a Valentine's Day lunch and did not have a bad experience however we have been to much better sushi places and this one did not stand out as anything special. We really liked the speedy service. My spouse loves sushi but I am not a big fan and got the chicken Katsu. That was pretty average as well. Overall, we wouldn't go out of our way to eat here again but on the flipside wouldn't tell someone to absolutely not go here."}
{"text":"I didn't really want to write a review but the chef asked me if I yelped and now here I am writing my first one.  Kaizen has quickly become my favorite all you can eat sushi place in town.  It's got great modern decor and every seat has an angle to a tv.  There is usually hip hop/top 40 music playing and on the main tv, they'll play the videos. Off topic but Flo Rida's Let it Roll video is hilarious.  I probably wouldn't have seen it if it weren't for Kaizen.  Thank you Kaizen video person.

Great decor and funny videos aside, the reason Kaizen get 5 stars from me is the food is de-lish!  It's re-dic good! Yeah, I just said \"re-dic\"! I recently took my cousin there and after eating some yellowtail belly nigiri, he just smiled and said \"this is f'n' delicious\".  They have some items that you are limited to 2 pieces but you gotta order them.  Definitely get the toro, yellowtail belly, hamachi sashimi with jalepeno, albacore with fried onions, most places won't even offer these on their ayce menus. The saba, cajun albacore, super white are wonderful, too.  I haven't even gotten to how good the rolls are.  The avocado train and snow white are standouts for me.  There's also an extensive appetizer list.  Grilled shishinto peppers are bomb!  Who even does shishinto peppers at ayce? Kaizen does, that's who!  I'm usually stuffed by dessert but I force down some strawberry mochi and creme brulee which I end up regretting but I can always do some cardio the next day.

I thank my friend for having his birthday at Kaizen. I love it here.  Oh, another plus is they do a stamp card.  Buy 10 get 1 free, now if I could only remember to bring my stamp card.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I have."}
{"text":"I'd give 0 if I could. The service is awful and sushi is average. If you decide to go to this place make sure you order double what you would want because only half will come. Also, if you like eating on a clean table seek a different restaurant"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Fast service and half prices select sushi but the food isn't anything special ."}
{"text":"I've visited for AYCE several times, but most of the time I order a roll or two for lunch and pick it up. It's always fresh and delicious! It's definitely a better bargain for your buck to eat AYCE than to order two rolls, though."}
{"text":"The men's bathroom is absolutely disgusting and has been for a long time. There's a nasty air purifier in there that doesn't do anything other than circulate bad air, the paint on the door never really dried so it feels tacky and gross, and the toilet is usually dirty. 

Great food but I'm not coming back until something is done about this. I hope the staff that touches the food uses a different place to wash their hands. Not a bathroom you want your children going in alone, for sure."}
{"text":"I have been going to this sushi place since 2009 the quality has only gotten better and the service is always top notch. When I come back from a long trip the first thing I want Kaizen on eastern"}
{"text":"I love Kaizen sushi. Their fish is always fresh and delicious. They have great rolls I can't find anywhere else like the Orange Blossom and Avocado Train. For dinner they include two different sashimi orders on their All You Can Eat menu. SASHIMI INCLUDED IN AYCE.  Awesome. 

My husband and I eat here about twice a month and we are always treated like good friends by the adorable servers and talented sushi chefs. We have never had anything less than stellar service. 

We love that they have a punch card for AYCE and your 11th is free. We have been frequenting this place not even a year yet and have already received two free AYCE meals.

If you are looking for great sushi in an enjoyable atmosphere with personable service, go to Kaizen."}
{"text":"First time coming here and absolutely love it. The setting is peaceful and soothing. Good was great and very satisfying. Will recommend to family and friends. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"It is good place to eat sushi at north las vegas. 
Love it !

Try their silver state and orange blossom !
They have toro in all you can eat !
Soft shell crab with sweet potato is must get item !
Avocado train is soooooo good !!!!"}
{"text":"This was my 1st time here.  So i was excited because of the good reviews.  I understand that when i arrived there were 2 parties ahead of us, but there was no reason to wait 30 minutes to be seated when there were open tables.  

Ambiance : I finally got seated, and I immediately notice at how much trash was left under our table from the previous  party.  That should've been swept up before seating us.  Besides the visible trash on the floor, the ambiance was nice.  Very modern looking with low lights.  Moderate amount of noise, but nothing unusual for a busy place.

Customer service: I understand I came later in the evening and the staff must be tired from a long day, but I still expect decent customer service.  
The other staff members were more eager to assist us than my own waiter.  We ordered the ayce, but he didn't seem to want to take our orders.  Almost like he knew his shift was almost done, and he didn't want to be there already.

Quality of food:  I ordered almost all the nigiri that was raw plus the raw fish in the cold dish section.  I wanted to order the sweet shrimp and uni, but i was informed by my waitor they were all out.  I also ordered oysters.  The oysters were chilled well and fantastic.  The quality of the fish though was average, but what I really wanted to point out was many of the raw fish that was served to me appeared to be room temperature.  I got VERY ILL the night after I ate there ,and I know for a fact that my last meal before I ate there was at 10 in the morning.  So I know it was from the food they served me.

Conclusion:  I payed for the ayce dinner price although they had no sweet shrimp or uni.  Ambiance would have been stellar if they cleaned the trash on the floor before they seated us.  I will never eat there again because their food made me sick."}
{"text":"The Super White is amazing! Great atmosphere and service. The restaurant is clean and nice.We will be back."}
{"text":"TL;DR - A quality AYCE sushi bar right outside Vegas. Beats out most of the sushi places in the Bay Area. Delicious food for a great value, but service is sometimes spotty. Would definitely come back here while in Vegas!

I've been here once before, but never thought to write a review because I thought I wouldn't be back.

Well, I did. And here are my impressions.

$27 for an AYCE sushi dinner is a great value, considering it's Vegas, of course. I was here with a large group. There was little wait, but we already had a reservation here, so no worries there.

As with any AYCE restaurant that is NOT a buffet, there is a sort of time limit. This restaurant has set a 90-minute limit for eating, but we were here for over 2 hours!

Onto the food. I ordered quite a bit of food, so I'll have to break it down dish by dish.

I started off with the Tuna Poke salad. Very small for an appetizer, but damn, it packs a punch of spicy! Fish was very fresh and cleanly cut. Seaweed was fresh and cold.

I then ordered a spicy tuna hand roll. Lots of spicy tuna, which was a HUGE plus for me! Spiciness was subtle, but there were no vegetables, not even a slice of cucumber, to add a fresh crunch.

My sister and I then ordered the Rainbow and Dragon rolls. The Dragon had flavor, but it's just your standard California roll with unagi on the top. Nothing too special there. The Rainbow is exactly the same, but with different fish to top. 

I looked at the menu and saw this Pork Belly appetizer. I knew I had to order it.

Perfectly executed, with lots of flavor to compliment! Green onions on the top add a freshness that compliments the pork even further.

Fresh oysters...an appetizer most sushi places in the Bay serve. Flavor was there for sure, and presentation was on point! A bit small, but I think that's because it isn't oyster season.

More appetizers. I ordered a bacon and shrimp skewer and some sashimi (I forgot what fish).

This bacon and shrimp skewer was some of the worst I've seen. It looks charred, maybe burnt a little. Messy presentation. Flavor was subpar. This is an appetizer I WOULD NOT recommend.

The sashimi, however, was a completely different story. The one I actually ate had a smoky flavor to it, which was interesting, but something I actually really enjoyed. A crunchy topping sealed the deal with presentation. Excellent. Wish I could tell what it was, but I completely forgot.

Baked mussels and jalapeño poppers sealed off the main meal. The mussels had a deep flavor to them, but its freshness was completely covered over by the cheese, sauce, and fish egg topping. The jalapeño poppers packed a HUGE punch of flavor AND spice, but I'll leave to you guys to try it. Or maybe it's just me. I don't really know.

For dessert, I ordered the vanilla crème brulee. But...they ran out of vanilla. And the servers running around the restaurant didn't notify me until AFTER I asked to check with the kitchen AFTER waiting 20+ minutes for it to come out. I settled for the green tea instead. Flavor was there, but inconsistent. Some parts of the brulee were sweet, whereas others were...bitter, but that was in part due to HOW crème brulee is made.

Service was spotty, for lack of a better word. Some servers were quick to take my orders, while others took a while to come to me, and some servers told me that I wasn't their server. I'm like, \"OK, but you're still a server. You should be taking my order, no matter which table you're 'assigned' to.\" And then that snafu I mentioned above.

TL;DR at the top of this review."}
{"text":"They have great food but there service was slow. Been here for over an hour and still haven't gotten everything we ordered. Maybe today they didn't expect the business. The sushi is good though. I may give it another chance."}
{"text":"I don't care what anybody thinks. This place is the best place in vegas to get some sushi.
I've been to a lot of places around town and even had a favorite sushi spot I would hit up often, but this one took the cake.
It is a bit of a drive, but to me it's worth it to feed the hungry, picky beast that lives in the depths of my belly.

The baked muscles are probably my favorite thing on the menu, along with the silver state roll.
Once I start, I can't stop, and that's ok because it's all you can eat, and I have a beast to satisfy. 

The food is not the only thing I love about this place; the enviroment and service is top notch. 

If you are a sushi lover like I am, give this place a try.
You'll be glad you did. 
I hear they have other locations too, I haven't been to them yet but maybe I'll go check them out and review them later."}
{"text":"The people are extremely rude, you would probably think this place is hurting for money by the prices and the ridiculous all you can eat rules. You can't share even appetizers, and can only pick from less than half the menu, if you want something that is in red writing on the menu you have to pay full price. Will NEVER come back here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I visit Kaizen about 3 times a month. Being that we live minutes down the road, Kaizen has become our default place for sushi. There are not very many sushi places on the north side of town, but Kaizen is the best by far. We often take guests there, and they are mostly impressed. 
The service is sort of hit or miss. The waitresses speak very little English, so if you are not familiar with roll types that could be a problem. However, they are very nice and are quick to refill drinks. The service behind the sushi bar is good, and the rolls are served with a sense of urgency. 
I have always gotten fresh fish, and the vibe is nice, so I guess this means we will be returning :) 
The only reason I didnt give them another star is because of the loud music videos playing that do not match the scene what so ever."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places!  We love the Red Rock Roll, jalapeño poppers and Spicy Albacore.  It has become our favorite sushi place!  Yum!"}
{"text":"My family and I were wanting to try out a new AYCE sushi place, and this one was not too far away so we decided to try it out. The place was full of customers, so I already knew it would be quite busy. 

Our waitress took our first order but seemed quite overwhelmed. We made a big order at first because we felt like the service could be slow, so it was our best bet. Service ended up being slow. I noticed our waitress would ignore us because she would intentionally always be on the other side, and never give us eye contact. This was frustrating because we just wanted to order more. Finally, she came back and we made a few orders of nigiri, to my surprise, they added way too much rice. At this point, it seemed like they just wanted us to leave, or maybe the chef just decided to put more. Either way, I was disappointed in this place because of the rude waitress. 
We weren't the only party that received bad service from her, because another customer had to walk towards the kitchen just to ask for the check. It took awhile for us to receive our check, but I was beyond annoyed by everything. Sadly, I didn't get her name. Otherwise, the food itself was good, except the 2nd round of nigiri.

TLDR; Received bad service, the waitress was being rude, the food was good except towards the end because it seemed like they just wanted to get rid of us."}
{"text":"Great service and the all you can eat is worth it! I would gladly recommend it to anyone who loves sushi and wants a large variety with a korean fusion"}
{"text":"I went for the AYCE dinner on a Friday night.  Sat at the bar.  Service was prompt, yet a bit confusing as I had a total of 3 different waitresses.  When I asked for a refill of my Coke, they actually took away my cup to refill it in the back instead of just bringing me a fresh one with a fresh straw..leaving me drinkless for about 2 minutes.

As for the food, it was uninspiring.  I found the AYCE to be quite stingy for $27 and restricted from most of the best items.  The tuna poke salad had exactly five small cubes of tuna in it.  The gyoza tasted slightly freezer burned.  The shrimp tempura was not actually tempura but some kind of battered shrimp.  Real tempura is light, flakey, golden and hand battered just before going into the fryer.  I suspect these shrimp came pre-battered and frozen.

The seemingly wide selection of rolls on AYCE is actually very heavy on filler and very light on premium cuts of fish.  Lots of spicy tuna filler and rice.  After receiving my first roll from the sushi chef, I waited a few moments to see if any wasabi or ginger would be forthcoming.  No, I had to ask.  

Be very careful to order a half roll or you will be forced to eat a rather large roll of mostly filler.  Just know, if you get the AYCE, you're gonna be eating a lot of white rice.   

All in all, not horrible, but definitely not worth the price.  I got the feeling that there is too much of a focus on profit."}
{"text":"Always a great experience, my wife and I enjoy coming here at least once a month, the food is great and the staff is polite and attentive. I will always come back."}
{"text":"I have never been to a sushi place I love more. My friends got me going here on our trips to vegas, its a good spot for a 2am food stop!  They will alternate any rolls for you to fit your diet needs.  They are pretty pricey for, about $10 a roll.  I think the best rolls are the tempura rolls, but you cant go wrong with fried stuff.  Anything baked, yummy too!  The baked salmon roll was to die for!  Eel sauce, glazed over, with baked salmon on top, so tasty!  The service is great, always on top of things, food comes out at a decent time.  I have only been to two of their locations, one on Paradise, which is my usual spot and I recently discovered the Flamingo location, which is close to my work, so stoked!  For good sushi at a decent price, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This was my very first all you can eat sushi in after moving in to town and I was not disappointed! Came for an early dinner and got seated right away. We had two servers, both that were very attentive and helpful our entire time there.

Prices are average for it being all you can eat. Not to mention... their menu is HUGE! From appetizers to fried food to long rolls and even dessert. I'll have to come back at least two more times to try everything that I want to without getting so full! 

But so far, everything I ordered was great and there was no leftovers. One thing that I liked most was that you could order half of their long rolls so you are able to try more rolls in one sitting.

I deduct one star because I was disappointed with their dessert. We ordered the mini honey toast with chocolate ice cream and took about 15 minutes to get to us. Even more disappointed when the toast was not toasted, the edges were just a little burnt. Bleh. Next time I'll stick to the mochi ice cream. But other than that I was completely satisfied with everything and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have gone to another places, but this place is delicious. It's fresh and the service is great. We usually sit at the bar and the waitresses and chefs know exactly what we like and have it ready quickly."}
{"text":"As always, great food and even better service.  All you can eat. Had halibut tempura special that was excellent"}
{"text":"Usually I can deal with their bad service but our server was especially rude and the food was awful too. 

Wait time was what made the experience yucky and truly unpleasant. Not the seating wait time but for your actual food to come out, IF it comes out. It is understandable for us that it is busy and maybe a 30 minute wait for the minimal amount of sushi that we ordered is still ok. We were there for 2 HOURS and barely got most of the sushi we ordered as the restaurant started getting less busy. We've even asked our servers if our food was coming or not and still the things we ordered again did not come the entire time we were there.

One dish after another came out cold or poorly prepared. One of the first plates dropped at our table was the Snow White. As hungry as I was, I dove in without hesitation & was met with a nice large bone. I brushed it off, set the bone aside & moved on to the next dish, the Silver State, a baked roll with cream cheese, yamagobo, crab & some other yummy ingredients. Did I mention it was a baked roll? Yeah well, that came out cold.. Do you know how long a baked roll has to sit around outside the oven before it gets cold? About 7-10 minutes. How do I know this? I, too, work at a sushi place. 

After that came the pork belly... 2 pieces in an order. One piece came out warm & the other came out stone cold. The steamed gyoza came out slimy because it had been sitting in a plate of excess water. My miso was lukewarm. I DIDNT EVEN EAT MY TEMPURA ICE CREAM BECAUSE IT WASNT FRESH. Anything fried in oil needs to be served immediately to avoid becoming like a stale french fry! I could also saw and heard a bald man with glasses yelling at another coworker which made me feel uncomfortable.

For those brave enough to head out to Kaizen to try their luck please contact me because I have 10 stamps on my stamp card & I WILL NOT be back to claim my free meal."}
{"text":"The all you can eat is an awesome deal for 27.95.  You will get your money's worth.  All the menu items listed in black print,  you can choose from.   Sit at the bar if you want faster service.  The fish is fresh,  so don't worry bout getting sick."}
{"text":"Had a chance to go to lunch with my wife and we decided to try Kaizen. I had read good reviews and when we arrived, found that it was AYCE. PLUS! The place is in a nice location, but always seems to be on the wrong side of the road, but now that I know exactly where it is, I will have no problems changing my route. The food was lovely, the staff was nice, even turning down the music a little bit, since we were seated underneath a speaker, by the monitor, The fish was nice, fresh and rather large for a AYCE. The service was a bit slower than we were used to, but part of that was how busy the place was and how indecisive we were. Many different rolls to try and I promise that we will be quicker the next time we visit. So glad we stpped in. It will not be our last."}
{"text":"Great service and the food was amazing as always. I had all you can eat and enjoyed a variety or rolls, appetizers, and desserts. My favorite roll here is the soft shell crab roll. I look forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite AYCE sushi restaurant in Las Vegas. I have eaten at a number of both medium and high end sushi restaurants in Vegas and this is the only one I continue coming back to. 

The menu is extremely extensive with everything you could want from nigiri, rolls, beef tataki, and even yellowtail and salmon collar. I even have a friend who doesn't eat raw fish and he loves this place and is able to easily fill up. While there are certainly some plates I like much better than others, even the dishes I don't care for were worth trying (especially since it's all you can eat).

The service can be hit or miss. They are never rude, but can take a little longer than you'd like especially if they are busy. But when I eat sushi I am rarely in a hurry so this doesn't bother me. 

As this is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas, I have tried a large number of their dishes. I would highly recommend the SALMON COLLAR! I avoided it for the longest time because I didn't really know what it was. Finally a friend said I had to try it and from that point on my AYCE dinner will never be complete without it. Aside from the traditional rolls and nigiri, I would also suggest the tuna poke salad, seafood salad, spicy tuna salad, beef tataki, pork belly, rock and roll, orange blossom roll, and the honey toast for dessert. 

Always a great experience."}
{"text":"Usually have great reviews for the place, however, with the exception of the guy server with glasses and tattoos who is always pleasant and attentive, the other servers have no customer service skills and look as if they don't want to be working. 

It takes a long time to get our food ordered and delivered to. We were not the only ones who had this experience we witnessed about 2 other couples with such disappointment. 

We used to love coming to this restaurant but it is now time for a change.  

Date of this post is July 1 2016 approx 1000pm leaving the restaurant."}
{"text":"I loved the food and the humble atmosphere, and it was located directly across from my room at the Hard Rock Hotel"}
{"text":"I have to say by far the worse costumer service possible the food is decent but who wants to deal with the server... Hopefully they can get another one or just forget about keeping the doors open. No worth my hard earned money. Yucky!"}
{"text":"Horrible service.  There were 2 available tables, but were told me and my children had to sit at the bar.  Never going back there again."}
{"text":"This is our favorite sushi spot, which is why it even gets 3 Stars. HOWEVER, we don't go for the service...doesn't matter how busy or slow the restaurant is...the service is always slow and wonky... (there used to be a hostess who was absolutely horrible and seemed to hate the world, but we haven't seen her in a while ) Recently we were in, and watched the servers hang back and chit-chat....while no one came around like other restaurants, relaying breaks, the kitchen is working on it, water refills (except at the end) etc. 

The Avocado train, Japanese lasagna, OMG, monster and crazy boy are some of our favorites. The KFC and monkey brain appetizers are also great! We come and stay for the food, but lots to be desired on service each time."}
{"text":"The best sushi in town. Excellent food & service. I kill for their tuna poke, fresh oysters, crispy rice with spicy tuna, sashimi & salmon skin hand roll."}
{"text":"I love sushi and I can eat a lot of it. So being able to do all you you can eat sushi for $30 is awesome! I recommend coming in around the time they open (4pm) they get busy fast and the service isn't to great during that time.."}
{"text":"I would have given this place a 4 star review except for the service. We sat at he bar and the sushi chefs never even acknowledged we were there. The ambiance is very sterile. I only do ala carte and my BF orders AYCE, no problems until my BF ordered dessert...apparently you can only get 1 flavor mochi...didn't realize mochi was such a commodity!!!  Will probably come back but only to sit at the tables. Good sushi/not so good service."}
{"text":"My favorite AYCE sushi place! One of the reasons I love this place is the massive selection they have. They have beef short ribs, pork belly, ramen, curry, and of course sushi. It's basically a one stop shop. Especially if you can't decide what you want to eat. I would say you really get your money's worth at this place. Because once you're done with your meal, you still have dessert. Their dessert menu also has a lot of choices. From mochi ice cream to creme brûlée to cheesecake. All of them are really good. Atmosphere is nice and the service is great. Don't know what to try? Ask the waiters and they will definitely give you a great suggestion. If you want the best bang for your buck and you want a lot of variety of food for your money, please go and try this place."}
{"text":"First time eating here as All You Can Eat.... We ordered several items and they came out quick. Service is speedy. Food was very good as well. We will definitely be back. Hands down best Sushi spot in North Town"}
{"text":"Today was my third time here, and while my last two trips were subpar in the freshness quality of the nigiri, I was beyond pleasantly surprised when the Super White Tuna and Salmon nigiri practically melted in my mouth. They were also much more generously portioned than before. Whatever has changed since last Fall with the fish, keep it up Kaizen!

(One star removed simply because I had to flag down a different person at first because our server was pretty occupied with a bigger table, and slightly longer wait times than we were used to. Wasn't THAT busy but all is well when our meal ended with me a Tempura Cheesecake and her a Chocolate I've Cream Cone.)"}
{"text":"This is our go to ayce glutton fest on the north side of town. Even though it's close to us (so a little biasism is to be expected) one of the best sushi places in vegas."}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever experienced. Came in for AYCE lunch with my girlfriend. At the time there was only one other person eating at the sushi bar. Every time we asked to order food, the waiter, Daniel, said \"One second\" and kept walking away. The first time he did it, he walked to the front entrance where no one was and just stood there. The second time we tried to order sushi, he again put his finger up and said \"one second\", walked to the table behind us and checked on them. Ended up taking a massive food order from their table, then proceeded to check up on another table after that. About 20 minutes later, still no return to our table, because he instead was just standing watching tv. I tried again to order, by waving him over to our table. He put his finger up again and singled \"one second\" and went to another table. Let me remind you, I interrupted him from watching TV. I finally got him to our table and Once again he said \"one second\" walked away from us and took orders from tables else where. We are small girls. We don't eat a lot. We weren't abusing the AYCE system, not even close. In fact, every order he took other than ours out weighed us by x3. It was clearly discrimination. My girlfriend and I have never experienced such rude, clearly discriminatory service before. I Would not only never come back here, I'm going to be extremely vocal in my highly publicly involved job in Vegas about how bad the service is at this place. Save your self a bad experience and go to I Love Sushi!"}
{"text":"This place has been shut down several times for imminent health hazzard.  Dirty place, not going here to eat."}
{"text":"Every time my better most amazing other half that she says she isn't a half but my whole other person... and I come here we always leave feeling full and satisfied. The fish is fresh and the service is outstanding. Other sushi places make our stomachs feel like there's a tape worm but this is the best sushi place in town!"}
{"text":"No AYCE but the food is so fresh it doesn't matter!!. This is not just a sushi joint it's one of the few places I've had the pleasure to relax and just chill, drink, and have a great time. Great place to do sake bombs with your table and the chef lol!!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, the sushi here is absolutely delicious. Their baked salmon roll is spectacular. Their service, however, like at the other Kaizen on Paradise, is a little awkward. Don't sit at the bar and expect to have a great time chatting up the bartenders, this is more of a go with a group of friends and eat their amazing food type of place."}
{"text":"***1 star isn't for the food it's for the experience. The food was on point and I'd go far as to give it 5 stars....*** 

Some friends and I were looking for some late night sushi and this place was closer and had amazing reviews. They advertised that they are open until 12 on Saturdays with ayce. Cool. Sounds great. We arrived at 11, got seated, and was immediately told that last call was \"now\" by our waitress. I asked her if we'd still be able to order sushi via alacarte and she said yes as long as it wasn't ayce. With that knowledge we ordered a few rolls and an entree to share with an intent to order more rolls in the next few minutes. My friend orders a dragon roll and the waitress comes back to tell us they're closing down the sushi bar.... 

I'm sorry but this sounds like false advertising. Ayce until 12 was what we expected and when we didn't even get that we still weren't able to order more alacarte sushi, which she said we would be able to do, just 5 min later! If she was more up front about us having to order all the sushi in the beginning then that's what we would've done! I'm familiar with last call in sushi restaurants but doing it an hour before closing on a Saturday is ridiculous. Other restaurants I've been to do last calls about 15-20 min before they actually close. 

Again, your food is delicious but it's not worth the kind of service we received this night."}
{"text":"This is our favorite local sushi restaurant. It is so affordable and you can't go wrong with their all-you-can-eat option. I love that the sides, apps, and desserts are included! My kids love going here. They get the all you can eat and try new things and leave very stuffed!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best ayce sushi in Vegas... hands down... there are so many quality choices with great attention to detail. You'll seriously have to go there 4-5 times before you try everything!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite AYCE restaurant, but definitely a decent one to check out. Walking in, you're always greeted. The layout of the restaurant isn't what you would expect from the outside. Every time we have gone, we have yet to see them busy. I do feel like the servers watch you to make sure you're eating everything. Last visit, I made a trip to their restroom (which needed a cleaning) and walked back to my table like I stole something. No specific roll stuck out to me,  it was all tasty, try their green tea creme brulee,  BUT  say no to their tempura cheesecake. Overall, their food, service and location is good enough to come back."}
{"text":"A great assortment, even non-sushi items. My partner loves sushi, so found a roll that he loved. I had an assortment of items in the bento box. I didn't care for the Korean BBQ short ribs; too much fat and bone.  But everything else was wonderful and there really is something for everyone. East to recommend!"}
{"text":"You get sashimi here (limited per person) and it's delicious . The staff is really chill and always checking to make sure you are good. It's also nice that you can do half rolls!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years but tonight the experience was perfect. 


EXCELLENT on all points.


Service - Servers are friendly and attentive, no wait ever
Quality - Delicious, fresh, and all other synonyms. . . 
Location - Aliante/Centennial Area
Atmosphere - Beautiful interior, clean, quiet
Value - 26.50 AYCE & the menu is extensive!!! 



MUST TRY."}
{"text":"Listen, I've given this joint so many opportunities to get a better rating because the all-you-can-eat menu is fairly priced and the food is decent. The customer service is bad everytime. I feel like when they know you're gonna order the all you can eat, there's an automatic switch in their minds that's turned on and they decide to not give your table as much attention. The service slowly gets worst the longer you sit and eat. They will take your first round of orders pretty quickly and the the 2nd round, they will return in 20 minutes and the 3rd round they'll take your order but never return. I wanted an order of miso soup and after waiting 25 minutes we got up, paid and left. I will not return. There are other Sushi joints nearby with better service and an all you can eat menu."}
{"text":"First time reviewing Kaizen after coming here for over 2 years, and it's not for a good reason. We love the food and the staff, but we just left there disappointed because they were closed early, and unfortunately this is the second time it's happened. They're supposed to be open until 11:00, and I could understand if we got there 10 minutes till, but it was only 10:13! We had friends drive down from Summerlin to join us. If you're going to shut down the kitchen 53 minutes early, then PLEASE, either change your closing time to 10:30 or keep your kitchen open until closing time."}
{"text":"Wow- better than expected!!! Good food, fast service!! I got the seaweed salad, kids had chicken Katsu, and the dragon roll!!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly waitress and sushi Chef. The Palm Springs roll is to die for. I love the deco at this place, very clean and more modern looking than other sushi places. They have a 50% off menu, and a happy hour 7pm until ? with discounted drinks and a happy hour sushi menu."}
{"text":"Overpriced.  Pretty good selection of rolls, but if you prefer nigiri sushi you can do much better.  Very nice modern decoration and ambiance.  The service is good.  The place is very clean."}
{"text":"My 2nd Kaizen Sushi restaurant I visited in the last 3 months.  I actually like the location across from the Hard Rock, but gave this place a try since there really isn't too many sushi options in North Las Vegas.  

Mary P. starts her review with AYCE and that's what got me here.  The Paradise location doesn't offer AYCE.  Since I'm having all I can eat, I'm going to be all I can be.

My Meal:

-Sushi:  Tried their Yellow-tail, Halibut, and Salmon.  Because it's AYCE, the portions are bit smaller.  But it's all you can eat, so order more if you can stomach it.  All were fresh, but in my opinion thought the Yellow-tail was the best of the three.  

-Sushi Roll:  Had to get a western style sushi as well.  Tried the Red Rock, which consist of Shrimp Tempura, Spicy Tuna, and Seared Tuna.  It wasn't the tightest roll, actually got a little messy.  Good thing I had my chopstick skills in check.  Roll was good, but after awhile all spicy tuna and tempura shrimp rolls taste the same.  

-Chicken Fried Rice:  Probably the best item that I got from here.  I love me some friend rice, especially chicken fried rice.  Wish some adobo was mixed in, but beggars can't be choosers.  Healthy portions for AYCE as well. 

-Katsu:  Pretty good and one of my bigger order regrets.  Not because it wasn't good, but because it was just a lot of food.  I felt that the katsu was a too greasy, but it's fried food so what am I suppose to expect.  My other issue is that I didn't think they would serve it with another cup of rice since I already ordered the Chicken Fried Rice.  Carb overload for sure!!

My dining experience was just okay.  I had great service from the sushi bar, but just okay if I ordered something outside of sushi. Restaurant is average sized with TV's at the bar and a projector on the wall.  

My only issues...no brown rice and their Japanese Steak was out.  

Overall, I give them 4 stars because it's probably one of the better sushi spots in North Las Vegas.  My next visit may just be for their Chicken Fried Rice."}
{"text":"A perfect and nice place. Food is fresh and the staff is super cool. The atmosphere is wonderful with beautiful decoration. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite AYCE sushi place. I come here almost every weak. Servers are very friendly and the food is amazing. They have a huge menu for AYCE from sashimi to honey toast. Must try!"}
{"text":"Service was decent. Sushi was, well, it didn't taste rotten or anything, but I feel like they had no idea how to make rolls. Even the simple ones were sloppy and fell apart. Fish wasn't high quality, it was just kind of mushy and everything lacked flavor.

Even the mochi was gross. How do you screw up mochi?!

Overall, I give this place a solid \"meh\". There are much better AYCE sushi places in the valley."}
{"text":"I  am very picky with sushi, as I'm not a fan of many different types of raw fish (salmon/tuna/eel/etc) however, my husband and I came here last week to try their all you can eat and I was thoroughly impressed! Nigiri that I ordered was fresh, and came quickly, and my husband loved what he ordered as well. Personal favorite roll was the crazy girl. Their shrimp tempura was also DELISH! :-) then before leaving, they gave us a coupon for $12 off our next AYCE visit. Great staff!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place out. It's fairly small and we waited 40 minutes before we were sat down. The menu is extensive for AYCE which was real nice. 

We got our food fast ONLY when it seemed to be super busy. Once people started leaving and it wasn't getting as busy, it took forever to get our food. We would have to ask 5x where our order was and sometimes we didn't even get it. 

We were there for a total of 3hrs w 4 people. I've never been at an AYCE sushi place that long. That's how slow they were. 

The food itself is good. The pork belly was amazing. The 2 things I didn't like out of all the food we ordered was the udon noodles and the nigiri sushi. The soup for the udon noodle was very very sweet which was nasty. The nigiri has WAY to much rice. If you are a nigiri eater only, I'd suggest going to sushi neko on spring mountain and Decatur. They have really good food and service but menu is not as extensive as here."}
{"text":"Best sushi restaurant ever in Henderson! Sevice is very very excellent!! and food is so delicious!! I love this place. If you plan to trip to Las Vegas you must visit this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I come to this restaurant quite often as I love their sushi and think the quality of theI food is above par. However, their service is ridiculously slow. Tonight I had to wait 15 minutes to be helped, another 20 minutes to get my food, another 20 minutes for my waiter to return, and then after all of that I never received the other half of my order. It was very frustrating as I was not only very hungry but exhausted after a long workday. No one offered to speak with about my concerns, they just simply dropped my check off and said \"sorry\". I noticed that other customers were as equally frustrated with the service as I was. I'm disappointed as I really love their food, but over the last several months, it seems as though the service has gotten a lot slower."}
{"text":"Decent pricing, clean facility and food is good. The young lady at the front seated me right away. I turned in my order within 2 minutes as I was attended to right away. Great place"}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place when taking my mom out for a bite. There was something for everyone in my group, to include a kid's meal! Prices are good for what you get, I managed to eat my money's worth for the $27 all you can eat sushi. I love that I could order half rolls so I could sample more! They actually forgot my son's meal, but quickly corrected & even brought him a California roll to make up for the oversight, then took his meal from the check without us asking! Great food, excellent service, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic.

I only noticed recently that these guys have entered the league of AYCE sushi restaurants, and what an entrance it is. Toro (1 piece) and yellowtail belly (2) one-per-person on the _regular_ dinner menu. Yellowtail and salmon belly too. Yellowtail and albacore sashimi options. Extensive appetizer and small entree menu that reminds me of Umiya.

Heck, unlike some desserts weren't even limited, other than tempura ice cream and creme brulee being one for person. Man, I wish they hadn't been out of green tea creme brulee so that I might be able to compare it favorably to Goyemon's... But you know what, I still can do it because of excellent overall sushi quality. And because of the Ice Cream In Your Mouth dessert roll that kinda blew my mind. Save room for it when you go!

The service could have been a little better, but it was on par with my last Goyemon visit. After one visit, this joint is now easily in my top 4. You need to try this if you are a regular of Sushi Mon or another nearby sushi place. Or a non-nearby sushi place. Just go."}
{"text":"This place never seems to be busy, now I understand why. My friend and I have been here a few times when our preferred sushi bars had a long wait. The sushi is nothing spectacular. My friend took advantage of one of their specials; I believe they were half off sushi rolls, and the pieces were tiny. Their gyoza was mediocre, nothing special. The one thing I did enjoy was their green tea tempura ice cream. It is probably the second best tempura ice cream dish I have had, and that speaks volumes because I LOVE tempura ice cream. The vibe in here is awesome, and we have always had great service. If you're looking for great sushi, this really isn't the place to go, but I'm still giving it three stars because the vibe, service, and tempura ice cream are excellent."}
{"text":"This place has really good food but the people who wait the tables are terrible. Every time we go here we end up waiting around for our waitress who seems to disappear. We usually don't get our drinks refilled until we have been waiting on our check for about 15 minutes. This has happened the last 3 or 4 times we have been here.....its really disappointing...."}
{"text":"This spot has the best rolls in town. The all you can eat is fantastic! They can get busy but they are always timely. This isn't Wendy's people! I always get treated like a king when I come here. I would recommend Kaizen to anyone any day. They blow everyone else away."}
{"text":"This was such a fun experience! All you can eat, great variety of rolls, excellent service!"}
{"text":"Worst AYCE sushi restaurant. I have ever experienced. Went in on a Friday at 5. Not even busy, got our first order in, ate it, and ordered again. We waited for over 20 minutes while I saw our food brought out by the bar just sitting there. Our waiter was on the other side of the restaurant the entire time. We had to ask someone else to get him. He asked if we wanted to order something else. I told him we were still waiting for our first order. He said sorry. Then proceeded to grab the food that had been sitting there for 20 min and said oh here you go. I told him it was unacceptable and he complained that his staff called out and just kept giving excuses. I told him that I was extremely unhappy with the service and would never pay for this. He then said okay then get up and leave. Ridiculous. Would never go here again. Sushi didn't even taste that fresh."}
{"text":"This business has terrible customer service. We went for dinner waited over 30 minutes for a table to only see and be told by the host that she has to seat big parties before she's seats a couple. She sat 3 parties before us that came in after us. Customer service is not a priority at this establishment. I will not patronage this business again. I feel as if they think bigger parties make them more money then to service customers as they come in."}
{"text":"I prefer sashimi to sushi, and I am definitely no sushi or raw fish connoisseur, and having had a one hellish bout of food poisoning resulting from a night of sushi, I always feel slightly trepidatious when joining others for sushi. 
For $25 pp there is an all you can eat menu, so if you can consume a lot, this might be the best bet for you. 
We ordered so many different variations, both sushi, sashimi and nigiri, fried rice, dumplings. Their raw horseradish/ wasabi is to die for. I'd almost return to eat that alone. 
Service was friendly and the waitress listened to the ingredients I like and more importantly, the ones I do not want. 
My husband loves sushi, so I would return here again with him."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for almost two years now. Always love the AYCE! I've been to the other location in Henderson and I have to say this one is much better hands down."}
{"text":"They have a great selection of delicious rolls! I like that you can get half rolls on some of their AYCE sushi selections. Overall I enjoyed my experience there."}
{"text":"Great Sushi, Great atmosphere.  I love to take out of town friends to this place for some top notch Vegas sushi."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. I'm never disappointed,  best all u can eat sushi in town. Plus u get a stamp card!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great ?
The atmosphere is gorgeous comfortable and clean..
The service is 5 stars , Brad did an amazing job serving us 
All the rolls were yummy and not mothered and sauce..
We just bought a home on this side of town and we're happy to say this is our new sushi home .."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi. I came on my anniversary with my wife and took advantage of the happy hour drink specials. Love the environment, didn't spend too much, great staff."}
{"text":"Sushis adequate, customer service is absolutely horrendous, wait time is so long. Nice environment, but music choice is random. Only thing that was decent for me was the desert, which they had more of a menu for than most sushi places I've been too."}
{"text":"I was hoping the food would make up for the  bad service but...it didn't...

Maybe since I'm from California, my sushi expectations are high but bad service is bad service anywhere. 

Server: \"hi, how many?\"
Me: \"4, please.\"
Server then walks away, assists another table and doesn't say a word. She puts 4 menus on a table and walks away. Nice way to seat us....NOT! 

Since I've never been here, I would have liked for them to explain that there is an AYCE menu and a regular menu. I had to ask them a few questions for them to tell me that there was a whole separate menu for a la carte pricing. She seemed really annoyed at the fact that I just didn't know. My bad! Geez!

My tempura shiitake mushroom roll was the first thing to hit the table and it was made WRONG. When I asked another server what was in it, they didn't know so I had to show them the description in the menu. They agree to make another one correctly for me. 

The agedashi tofu was pretty good but it would have been even better if I had all of my food at the same time. My mushroom roll finally came about 10 minutes after everyone was done eating, which was about 40 minutes later. NOT GOOD. It wasn't rolled well and fell apart as soon as I tried picking it up with my chopsticks. 

When we finally got the check, we were charged incorrectly for our beers and I couldn't believe that they didn't comp me for my mushroom roll. Isn't that just good service and common practice? Plus this place is more expensive than most.

Sooooo...food was mediocre and the service was worse. Needless to say, I'll be looking for another sushi place when I visit my family. 

On to the next one.."}
{"text":"We go here often as it's close and always good. Very friendly staff and they put together very good rolls. Never doubt when we're in the mood for sushi, this place is good, and worthwhile."}
{"text":"It's an alright sushi restaurant. Our server seemed like he was constantly in a rush to take our order although it wasn't busy & when we needed him, it seemed like he was finding other things to do. & based off all the other sushi restaurants I've been to, they don't have much of a selection :/ 
?I wouldn't recommend getting anything where the tuna is grounded. It's not a pleasant texture & I didn't end up finishing the roll, that may just be me."}
{"text":"Beat prices California rolls and spicy tuna rolls!! Fresh and great to go. The customer service is nice and the staff always pleasant. The seating is limited, but adequate. Great music and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"The BEST All You Can Eat and the price is great if you come after 9pm $23, otherwise it's $29. They have a salad bar with delicious salmon Poki and Seawead salad. Try these rolls:
Monkey Brains (Yummy!!!)
Salmon Killer (Spicy like nothing else but it's GOOOOODDDD)
Snow White (it's unique and sweet and very pretty :-)
Energy ( it's shrimp tempura with salmon skin wrapping and a sweet sauce... Unique and delicious)
Rattle Snake ( if you like sweet eel this one is the bomb)
...
I never knew they had desert sushi other than Sweet Egg, but try their Ice Cream in My Mouth, lol... It's banana tempura wrapped in rice and topped with cooked strawberries in a sweet sauce... It's unique and ask for a rose on it for your special someone if you're on a date... Lol it was a surprise :-)

Also be prepared for some crazy trendy music video experience."}
{"text":"I love this place. This is where I tried sushi for the first time. My first roll ever was a hungry roll. IT WAS AMAZING!! The staff is great, and everytime I've gone it hasn't been busy so the wait time was moderate. Prices are rediculously low. I've tried 20+ sushi places in vegas and henderson and this is still hands down my favorite spot. The Hot Night Roll, the sashimi and sushi are great."}
{"text":"I had lunch yesterday (6/20/15) ...ordered the \"All you can eat\" because it was a great deal for 21.95. It was just my son and myself and we ordered 4 rolls. When the Server came to clear our plates she informed us of a $10.00 per person charge if we didn't finish the sushi left on our plates. ????? I could understand if we had ordered 10 different rolls and not finished them. But we ordered 4 rolls for 2 people, that's not excessive. (had 1 piece of each left on 2, one plate was gone and the last plate had 6 pieces because we didn't like it). The Server stated that if we ate 2 more pieces she would not charge us, so of course we did. I wont be returning to Kaizen and wanted to let others know about this so they aren't embarrassed like I was by an insane charge."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a Tuesday. Good sushi, large menu selection. The server was friendly and service was quick. Have gone several times since for dinner and had the all you can eat sushi. This is my favorite local sushi spot"}
{"text":"Very tasty, fast and fresh. Service was great as well. Crushed a bunch of sushi and left satisfied."}
{"text":"So glad there's a good sushi place up in North Las Vegas! Plus you can have 2 choices of dessert!"}
{"text":"I recently came here to celebrate a friend's birthday. Normally I don't travel over 45 minutes to eat unless I've heard SPECTACULAR things about a place, but it was the birthday boy's wish so I acquiesced. 

We arrived around 4 which is a slow time for most restaurants. Luckily we were still able to order from the lunch menu. We all order bento boxes, I went with the sashimi and chicken teriyaki. I don't know why I ordered chicken teriyaki, it's not something I would usually choose. It was ok. The fish were good, pretty fresh I would say. Nothing mind-blowing. The waiter knew my friends so he kept on checking in on us, he was very attentive and friendly. 

All in all, there are far better options near where I live and work without having to use up all my gas."}
{"text":"Not a bad sushi spot, but not over the top great either. I liked that the place had half rolls. Service was good and there were a lot of options. They even had gluten free soy sauce. I wish they had sushi rolls with real crab. This place filled our sushi craving as it was convenient, and in the area. Prices were reasonable. Added plus that it's next to a CREAM ice cream place. To be honest, I don't know if I'd go back because there wasn't anything that \"wow-ed\" me."}
{"text":"Very very good!! Always fast service,  lots of selections.....Here with great friends.............."}
{"text":"This was seriously one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. When we first came in, a very sassy girl told us \"hold on\" while she disappeared for 10 minutes. Then sat us. Took them 5 minutes to get our drinks. My fiancé asked for sugar in his tea 5 times, which they ignored every time. It took them 15 minutes to take our order. My food came out after 10 minutes or so but my fiancées never came. He asked to speak to a supervisor and the man he asked said he was. We told him our situation and all he could say was \"its busy\". Nothing else but that. Not an apology, a stupid excuse. We didn't finish our meals, just left. Our first time and definitely our last time."}
{"text":"From a person that loves to eat and sushi being amongst the top 5 favorite foods of mine, this place was not all that great. Well depending on what your looking for. Don't get me wrong the restaurant is very clean and it's a nice atmosphere for dinner or to have a relaxed lunch . Heck every roll I had, was very well presented. They looked very well prepared, however when it came down to business , to me it was a disappointment. All that color, all that elegance and presentation of the roll , lacked in the taste of the roll. It was like Trey Gowdy trying to find Clinton's \"Deleted emails\" the taste was just not there."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town!! All you can eat is a great deal! Very few menu items aren't included. The orders came out quickly, we tried as many as we could. The lasagna was the absolute best, melted in your mouth. Pepper seared tuna was awesome. The only thing I would like to see is a better wine selection. Don't change a thing with the food!"}
{"text":"Went in for AYCE with a friend. I go to the one on paradise frequently and it never disappoints so I didn't think this one would either. I was so wrong. 

Yellowtail, salmon, and toro nigiri was fishy and did not taste good at all. Small Seaweed salads were mediocre and miso soup was tasteless. When a server came through the curtain behind the bar, I'm pretty sure I saw a machine that had a picture of soup on it used to vend the miso. I then ordered the I love my ass roll. Weird name, didn't like that very much either. Gross roll. Everything tasted off. My friend had a tuna poki salad and it tasted rotten. Really old and fishy, we avoided all tuna the rest of the time we were there. Hard selection really because everything is tempura shrimp, tuna, or artificial crab mix. Only good thing was the vanilla creme brûlée. It was ice cold coming out to us. 

Super slow service. No refills on water, had to ask for the check several times as well as where our food was. In addition, I do not like being interrupted when speaking to someone. This happened more than once and I got annoyed after awhile. Yes if the plate is empty and has a napkin on it with rice everywhere that means take it. Don't interrupt my conversation to ask while reaching in between my friend and I. Didn't help that the chairs are too low and very uncomfortable. 

I did not enjoy my time and I will not be recommending this kaizen nor returning. Shame."}
{"text":"Love it!  I like that they do half sushi rolls!  The best rolls are the ocean roll, sexy roll and first kiss!  And their ice cream in your mouth is a very neat dessert roll!  Their AYCE price cannot be beat it includes Everything on their menu!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best spots in town! Forget going to all the hot spots, or \"poppin\" restaurants your friends referred you to. 

Stop into Kaizen for the best service from all around staff, some of today's favorites as well as your all time favorite traditional dishes, rolls, and Sushi! 

Their AYCE menu is HUGE, and tons to choose from for a great price! 

I will continue to come back here over and over!

Thanks KAIZEN!"}
{"text":"Seriously love this place, it's not crazy expensive, the people who work there are always nice and their rolls are always delicious! I am so glad I live close enough to go here when I am in the mood for sushi!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi spots. I come here all the time with my fiancé and some friends. Their yellowtail collar is the BEST, whenever they have it haha. 

I also love their garlic edamame. 

The all you can eat is worth it here if you come at a certain time when drinks are buy one get one free. 

The employees and managers are amazing and always give us a warm welcome when we get there. Since we are regulars."}
{"text":"This place wasnt bad, when i am beginning to go back eating sushi again...well the Veggie ones. But i reallly want to try that avacado train nxt time... :)"}
{"text":"Gave this place another try and what a mistake. I was standing at the entrance past 20 minutes to get noticed...not even a hello or smile or acknowledgment or anything in that matter. The owner of this establishment should really think about how important customer service is not matter how busy you may be. I will make sure to let everyone know to not waist their time or money. Gave them several of try's but left really upset every time."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years and have got to say - this restaurant has been very consistent in the quality of food and quick service.  They have plenty of appetizers to choose from, a good selection of rolls as well as a fair selection of nigiri/sushi. If I had to complain about something, it would probably be their sashimi which is very limited quantity for AYCE - but this is understandable because you have to do what makes sense for the business. Personally, I would just take it off the menu. Anyway, the quality of fish has never disappointed, the amount of rice on the nigiri is reasonable.  I'm not a huge fan of dessert, but their desserts could use some work. The cheesecake is not really cheesecake, nor is the tiramisu legit tiramisu but you can never go wrong with ice cream. The servers are always very nice and the chefs churn out the sushi at a good pace even on a busy night. Enjoy the service and make sure you get a punch card!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends who were craving sushi and wanted to try somewhere new. The food was alright, but the service could've been a lot better. Being in a bigger group, we ordered a bunch of different rolls. After waiting quite a while the rolls started to appear at the table, but more than 1/2 of the rolls we ordered never came. We had two different servers and mentioned the situation to both and servers and they did not seem too concerned about what happened to the rolls we ordered.  It was a little ridiculous because the table next to us kept getting roll after roll even when we ordered before them. Not cool. 

This was my first and last time coming to this place."}
{"text":"The best place to have dinner with the family. This is my wife favorite place to eat, the food is the best and they have the best service."}
{"text":"Let me just get straight to the point...the food is mediocre. There wasn't anything that really stood out.  I'm from Hawaii where the fish is as fresh as it can be.  The one thing I notice about Vegas sushi bars is not everyone serves good quality fish.  (Yes I know...we're in the middle of the desert.). There are a handful that do and I'd rather point you to that direction than come here.  I'm just disappointed that I've come across yet another Japanese sushi restaurant that was a total fail.  

The \"All you can eat\" option is $27 for dinner.  And there were some limitations on how much you can order for certain types of fish.  Understandable, due to it's market pricing but still defeats the purpose of an \"all you can eat\" menu.  

Overall, not a great experience for sushi/Japanese food.  It was ok for me and I most likely would not return.  Sorry Kaizen better luck next time!"}
{"text":"Came here because I read reviews that this place Bento box for lunch is good. It is indeed good! $12.95 for pick two items which I picked the fish and the teriyaki beef. It was delicious. The fish was nice and big, not some small skimpy fish. They also have pick two rolls of sushi for $11.95 for lunch which I think is a great deal but I decided to try that next time. You have to ask for the lunch menu because they just give you the normal menu when you sit down. Most of the servers was friendly there but one of the girl seem like she was in a bad mood.  Anyway I would recommend coming here for their lunch bentos special."}
{"text":"Their AYCE is awesome! Everything was fresh and delicious. I liked how they put little rice with the sushi. Place was clean and warming. Customer service was excellent. I definitely will come back here."}
{"text":"Let me say that this used to be one of my favorite sushi places in the valley.  I could care less that it wasn't all you could eat in the past because it was good quality and a pretty cool atmosphere.  Whenever I would go they would remember me and even my favorite rolls, the sushi chefs were super fun to talk to, and when eric was still there he would make up the most awesome presentations.  Gradually the quality of the sushi went down, and then eric disappeared, and the rolls coming out didn't even look or taste like their description or what I knew they were supposed to be.  They switched to all you can eat and several months ago (yes I took a while to write this) when we went it just was the last straw, the fish in those rolls was such bad quality I was a bit worried to eat it, almost every roll I ordered was made wrong, and the wait staff that used to be a really well oiled and cohesive unit was very disjointed.  It sucks they have gone so downhill when they used to be so awesome.  I wont be going back again."}
{"text":"We love our AYCE sushi dates and Kaizen did not disappoint.  Everything was fresh, flavorful and delicious!"}
{"text":"Almost a 5-star. Inconsistent service is their biggest problem.  Sometimes you wait quite a while and then get a whole lot at once other times in is one right after another.  

The food is always excellent.  The sushi is fresh and flavorful. The wasabi has a nice bite. The tempura is light. All the food on the menu is worth trying.  The even have dessert sushi - unusual and delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm a first timer here.  I enjoyed the bake scallop sushi and the chicken teriyaki.  Customer service was great"}
{"text":"Great Sushi. Love the half rolls. Very creative menu. Allows me to be able to try all kinds of new stuff. Fried rice in delicious too."}
{"text":"Really like the feel of the atmosphere of this place, they have a lot of bamboo and wood going on making it feel more Japanese just my opinion though, since I haven't been to Japan, food taste good to me, and very expansive menu including sushi burritos for those on a budget. My questions are always answered and it's great."}
{"text":"Food  is great service is poor ... sitting at bar, had to ask repeatedly to order than was told it would be a minute ... then proceeded to show us how happy hour list"}
{"text":"Great service and really creative rolls! Try the something spicy for a ridiculously spicy experience."}
{"text":"Great selection, fair price for all-you-can-eat sushi, and good quality."}
{"text":"We are heading out of Vegas and stopped here at Kaizen for the all you can eat lunch. The service and food was excellent! The restaurant was also really clean thanks for a great lunch will definitely stop by next time."}
{"text":"After a few visits, I finally decided on giving this place a solid 3.5

There's a lot of potential at this AYCE sushi restaurant. Good customer service and chefs are quick if you sit at the bar. Plus they keep their environment looking spotless at all times.

Even though their lunch menu had a wide variety, most of it seemed very repetitive with an ingredient change here and there. For an additional $6, you can opt in for dinner and get a few extra selections to devour from such as sashimi and special rolls that have 'lobster' in it.

Honestly, during all my visits I got to try a little bit of everything and realized that other than their Mango Salmon Roll and Baked Muscles, nothing really stood out to the point where I craved for seconds. 

P.S. Pictures of some rolls wouldn't hurt to be added to the menu."}
{"text":"It's official. I am giving up searching for sushi places.  Kaizen has been promoted to my #1 sushi spot because what makes a sushi spot golden for me is their selection of rolls (check!) and their appetizers (check!) and their service (check!)

I hope they don't ever get rid of the salad bar.  It makes me feel like I'm being healthy eating there. I love that the server kept giving us jugs and jugs and endless bottomless glasses of Iced Green Tea - a service many other places fail to do. I am so thankful for a Kaizen on my side of town so we don't have to go very far when we go home so full, so we can just plop on the couch with a smile on our faces and talk about when we can visit next, not too soon, but not too far, but maybe like once a month would be perfect.  And also, I am especially grateful that their rolls are bite sized, not like monster size, so that we can fit it in our mouths without having it be puffy full and we don't have to cover it with a napkin because other places make their rolls HUGE.  and its even an added bonus that we can order any rolls half order so we can try more yummy rolls that  they make.  

My only complaint - the music, well one song really.   please stop playing what it is that's playing Gangnam Style (both guy and girl version) because I lose my appetite for a moment because i absolutely for the life of me I cannot stand that song."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been here on multiple occasions and think it's definitely worth going. The menu has a lot of variety and there's lots of different sake and beer available as well. The atmosphere is pretty relaxing and it's never too loud or busy. The baked rolls are our favorites."}
{"text":"Great sushi, just did the a la carte, OMG Roll and Rock and Roll Role. AYCA is $26.50. 

Service was slow even though there were only a handful of customers, and it was disconnected (one order came out completely different and the reorder took 15 min...this was for dessert)."}
{"text":"I remember this place being a lot better than it was when I went recently for AYCE sushi. 

Pros: 
- Check in yelp offer = 1 free small hot sake! Who doesn't love free sake?!
- Salmon nigiri was delicious. Salmon portion was large and melted in your mouth

Cons:
- Every other nigiri we ordered besides Salmon was dry and did not seem the least bit fresh. There were some nigiri pieces that literally looked so dry I was hesitant to taste
- Once the restaurant got busy, our server barely came by our table to take our order/check up on us 
- We ordered 2 dishes of cooked fish (I think a mackerel and yellowtail collar) which didn't come out 40+ min after we asked for it. We cancelled our order and both still came out

If I can give one piece of advice, it's to go elsewhere for AYCE, especially if you're big on nigiri. Fish is not fresh here."}
{"text":"The food here has been excellent, tucked away near aliante casino this home to sushi fusion delivers from the heaping plate of edamame to drink specials to the interesting and unique rolls that all stand out on their own. The pricing is also awesome for the amount of food you get!"}
{"text":"They get 1 star because the fish tasted better than average. But they get -4 stars because their rules and service sucks compared to the other AYCE spots that are much better than this....they have lunch and dinner prices which is standard and then they have things that are lunch only or dinner only and if you want something from dinner during lunch you must upgrade to the dinner price, that's fine. But here is what's not....

I like to get a side of Masago...they wanted to charge extra for it! So I got Masago nigiri and just dumped it on my plate....my wife gets one roll only wherever she goes; fried shrimp, cream cheese, avocado, cucumber wrapped in soy paper...they had a roll with shrimp/cucumber/avocado and I asked to add cream cheese and soy paper to it....they said it will cost $1 extra each thing so $4 since she got 2 rolls....not ok. Oyshi and goyemon/sushi mon no charge. Ever.  

We ordered a side of calamari which on the menu says 3 pieces they brought it out it was 2 pieces. I said shouldn't it be 3? She gave attitude and was like no its always 2 it says it on the menu....I SAID UMMMM NO IT SAYS 3 right here...she apologized at least. But I can read I don't need your f'n attitude especially when we r putting up with your nazi rules and there are a million other places in town that do the same thing you do but BETTER. 

These are all dinner only. So I had to pay extra $5 to get ONE ORDER only of the following....

Only one ribeye portion 

Only one yellow tail belly (we get 8+ orders at other places on average)

Only one toro (ok but the order is only one piece???? Not ok. And when I asked the server why it's only one piece she said oh that one is only one piece...I said it should say it on the menu then n she was like \"well it does\" and I said obviously it doesn't....it didn't.)

Only one order of yellowtail and jalapeño....really????? Lame. 

Only one order of albacore with onions and sauce on it....lol really?!

Overall the food was above average like I said but the service and most of all the rules will make sure me and my regular AYCE friends don't come back. We will stick to Oyshi as our go to spot and goyemon. How this place won \"best sushi place 2013\" makes literally NO SENSE. I am 99% sure they paid the most to be #1. I have a friend who owns a restaurant and he said the \"Best of\" is a big money marketing scheme. Have to pay to play......

Stay away."}
{"text":"The food is really good though pricey! The service is horrible!!!!!!! The person at the register answering phone calls barely speaks English and is very very very rude!! That is why I eat here once every few months! The service and price doesn't make up for the good food! I'd rather go just 1/4 mile down the street to SUSHI TACHI! Their food is just as good, only the service is way better there!!!!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi place in Henderson! Always great service and the food is always top notch!"}
{"text":"The sushi was good. Started with daikon salad and garlic edamame was loved every bit. Until desert that is. I ordered Tiramisu. What I got was frozen. When I complained I was told Tiramisu is an ice cream based desert. Wut? Thevsad fact is that this abomination was still better that 90% of the Tiramisu I've had in Vegas."}
{"text":"I thought this was the same as the Kaizen on Paradise (maybe I'm confused) but the menu was different. Was quite as good. 

They did have some interesting 'fruit rolls.' I had the banana roll which was decent. The volcano rolls weren't really cutting it compared to the norm."}
{"text":"All I can say is damn ! Quality of food at this place has gone down hill. Rolls were made with excess rice , I guess to fill you up faster. No consistency in the making of the rolls. My son order a dragon roll , it tasted good, so I ordered it mine tasted horrible. We use to come here often when it first opened but stopped because the service sucked. We decided to give it one more try and definitely came to a decision to never come back. Service is better now but food awful."}
{"text":"Because this place is so close to my house, I used to go it all the time, but began trying some other AYCE sushi restaurants recently. This place is decent and the variety of rolls are pretty good. Place is nice and relaxed to sit and eat it. They do offer a lot of rolls with crab, which are my favorite, but I feel some of the rolls are a bit cold that give off a different taste, nothing bad, just different. The staff has good and bad days, but what place doesn't? The price for AYCE lunch is good and rolls are given a good taste, but like I stated, some of the rolls are a bit colder than they should."}
{"text":"I've been to 3 kaizen sushi places and this is the best one. Food was great, staffs were friendly and were always present to help. Too bad it's 30 miles away from my house."}
{"text":"I would give this place 6 stars because I love the food but I just tried to order and the prices have gone up a lot!  I'm so disappointed and I love this place too! We wanted to order the Philadelphia Roll and Japanese Lasagna. The Philadelphia Roll went from $9.95 to $13+!!! The Japanese Lasagna went from $8.95 to $10+!! When you order your food, keep in mind the prices are different from their website. Prices have gone up!! So disappointed. We cancelled our order."}
{"text":"Finally a hip and trendy sushi restaurant in Henderson/Anthem. I'm not a huge sushi lover, but this place is delicious. So good that my friend who hates sushi came here and now absolutely loves it! Ps: Their non-sushi items on the lunch menu are amazing. Oh! And I love the music video projection screen along with the music!"}
{"text":"About the best thing about my meal was the price. $12 at a sushi restaurant is cheap (for sushi), but considering the quality, I would have been better off spending $6 at in n out burger. Once again, I regret eating at a sushi place that has an AYCE option. The nigiri was eatable, but about as low quality as you will find. The fish was sliced so thin that you could see the rice through the tuna. Some of the cuts were also pretty mangled. Probably won't be back, but I'm glad I tried it out so I can mark it off my list."}
{"text":"What can I say??? This place is amazing! AYCE ..  Fresh, beautiful presentation, so many choices, sweetest server, attentive staff, drinks never empty, delicious, delicious! 10 stars if an option!"}
{"text":"Do not go here! First, I ordered takoyaki. It came out really fast, but 4 pc for $5. Are you kidding me? It's 2 cut half, and u call this 4 pc? 5 bucks???? Well..... straight flour in there..recommend Kona Grill, it's same price, but way better quality and environment and people speak English and cheaper there. I waited 30 min for my BBQ roll, but the chef didn't even started making my food, other customer ordered a lot but they got their food. And when the owner tell the chef to make my food, he said something like Fk, S***. U didn't make my food, and u say something like this?? Do not come here."}
{"text":"Kaizen has decent food but it's plagued by apathetic and snotty service. My party and I did the AYCE special because duh, obviously it's the best deal. But they impose a bunch of fascist rules which takes away the fun. Look, if you're gonna set some rules, then the food should be come out quick and don't roll your eyes or scoff if we give you a laundry list of orders

We ordered a bunch of rolls, nigiri, salads, and some bizarre \"Japanese steak\". Most of the food was decent and after a while it was hard to distinguish which was which because things started to taste the same. Avoid the Japanese steak. I was expecting a nice sliced steak but instead got a dry meatloaf turd in a sizzling skillet with diced asparagus. If you order the Screaming Orgasm salad, tell them to put the dressing on the side because they drown the field greens to death. But at least they don't stuff their rolls with rice and the fish was fresh. 

There are far better sushi places within blocks of this place with friendlier service."}
{"text":"I'm new to the sushi world, so some might take this rating with a grain of salt. But I think this place totally earned a 4.5/5!

You must understand, that only am I not much for sushi, I'm not much for fish. Let alone raw fish. But what we had here was fantastic and has me totally convinced that I can delve further into the world of sushi! So here's a list of what we tried and how we liked it. 

Gyoza - crispy on the outside and nice flavor on the inside. 

Egg Rolls - Even better and more flavorful than the gyoza! Simply, exactly what you want when you bite into an egg roll. Very solid. 

Pork Belly - I feel like pork Belly can be so hit or miss, usually because it's under seasoned or way to fatty and chewy. But this had the most delicious sauce on it and the fatty bits simply melted in my mouth. I couldn't help but order a couple plates!

Chicken Skewers - Again, so much flavor! Very simple, but so perfectly enjoyable. 

Monkey Brain - Tempura avocado stuffed with spicy tuna. While the tuna was a little too spicy for this girl, I totally loved the couple bites I had!

Tempura Veggie Roll - This Roll was stuffed with tempura veggies and was perfect for someone who's nervous about raw fish. 

BBQ Short Rib Roll - Again, pretty self explanatory. A Roll stuffed with Short Rib. It was nice, but easily overshadowed. 

California Roll - I actually didn't try this one. But my friend Ms. G who is also new to sushi ordered it and loved it!

Monster Roll - I can't tell you what was in it, but it was crazy awesome and a huge hit at our table. 

Crazy Girl - This was THE favorite according to me and hubby. Again, I couldn't tell you all the stuff inside. But I can tell you that the whole Roll was tempura Fried and then topped with crab. My husband is the real sushi lover in the house. He hits up some all you can eat places of a regular basis. And he swears that this Roll is the most awesome Roll he's ever had! 

The only mediocre part of the evening were the desserts. They tasted fine, but the presentation compared to the rest of what we'd experienced was extremely lacking. The tempura Cheesecake and ice cream were on ugly little plates that were only decorated with the most pathetic whipped cream I'd ever seen. The creme Brûlée was in an ugly Custard cup and was one of the smallest servings I'd ever seen. While they really tasted alright, the presentation really made us feel like we were getting really low quality ingredients. 

But because everything else was fantastic, we will totally be coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"Great place for AYCE.   Large menu with a unique selection.   Food always tastes fresh and service is always great !!!!   Don't forget to order the green tea creme brûlée !! Omg to die for !"}
{"text":"Best AYCE eat Sushi in Henderson area which was sorely needed. Great quality and selection. Fantastic service and really chill yet cool vibe.  Don't miss the Garlic Edamame, Clam Miso Soup, Pork Belly or Snow White Roll."}
{"text":"I have been here before but my experience wasn't memorable. I remember that I didn't hate it and that is what brought me here. 

Upon walking in the door I got a huge whiff of what most would say smells like unkept fish. I mentioned it to my friend and she agreed. We still decided to sit and have lunch. 

We were seated and the service seemed fast and friendly. We placed our order for food and drinks with no issues. We ordered 3 half rolls, 1 whole roll, & 5 appetizers. 

Our rolls arrived to the table before the appetizers. This is not unusual in a sushi restaurant but when we finished our rolls and our appetizers did not come we got worried.

We were asked if we wanted to order more food. We said no, just the appetizers. We waited about 20 minutes before the appetizers had arrived. I repeat. I was finished with my food 20 minutes before the appetizers even came. A little upsetting. Pork belly was delicious.  Other appetizers were burnt. 

This was a very disappointing experience. I may come back. But not during work lunch with other appointments to make."}
{"text":"Wonderful place with excellent quality and service! Almost as good as it gets (top 2/3) for AYCE in the Vegas area!"}
{"text":"No doubt the best in Vegas. Top notch quality in terms of food, taste, presentation, service, environment, EVERYTHING! As a recent transplant to Vegas, this is absolutely my go-to place for sushi, a la carte or AYCE! I'm sure that I'll get to know the chefs add they get to know me...and my bottomless pit of a stomach!"}
{"text":"Fresh sushi late at night and a cozy atmosphere. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"The quality of the sushi is very low. Inside the restaurant they promote if you write a positive review on yelp they will give you free alcohol, which I think is very unfair. We tried this place based of reviews and feel ripped off. If you like sushi do not go here."}
{"text":"Delicious AYCE!! I love coming here on Saturdays after my workout. Service is very fast. The sushi is sooo good. I'm happy I found a place that isn't on Spring Mountain!!"}
{"text":"I feel terrible to have to write this bad review because this has been one of my favorite restaurants for years but today was an absolute epic fail for them.  The wait staff has always been superb and still was. We walked in today being greeted with the same smiles as usual and got our favorite table. We ordered our usual ayce menu items.  We noticed first hand the sushi fish was a little warmer temperature than it is suposed to be so we decided to go with more of the cooked items that we like to get, not wanting to get sick from bacteria that grows in raw food at the wrong temperature. As our order of pan fried mackerel came out it was head in tact and only the top half of the fish.  as my significant other took one bite he spit out something long and red that didn't look normal.  I honestly thought it was a garnish until he opened up the fish to reveal several red worms. When he confronted the waitress oneeta she was very nice but I don't think agreed they were worms until she took the fish to the back to show the chef or cook named Juan. It was obvious this was a big deal because she came and profusely apologized telling us thank u for bringing it to thier attention as they must send the entire shipment back because it could be infected with the worms as well.  She then proceeded to tell us the meal was comped and asked if we wanted anything else.  We ordered an item or two but just felt grossed out after and couldn't do it. I drank some sake tipped the sweet waitress and left.  I love all the people that work the front as servers and sushi chefs but realize this really needs a note to warn people to be careful if u are eating there! check inside all the fish u order and also demand they get thier refrigerators working properly or that they make sure they're food is being stored at the proper temperature for this could cause a lot of sick people.  I've heard that people have died from worms in thier bodies and terrible food poisoning. I got nauseas after I left just thinking about it again in my head and pulled over to vomit a bit unfortunately.  We shall see if my significant other gets sick. Here's hoping he doesn't but just please be aware.  My apologies to the dear staff there I love u all but this had to be said.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Amazing Rolls. Fresh Sushi. Great service. This place is probably is my new favorite sushi joint in the area."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food, service, and atmosphere!

Will definitely come again in the future. Very happy I brought my family."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is only subpar. 

Been here once during lunch time and service was slow and non attentive. It wasn't busy at all and there were only two other tables there. 

Came here with my daughter and all her food came before mine. When I mentioned that I haven't received one thing that I ordered yet the server stated that they would go check on my order. Few minutes later I see the server walking around and didn't come back to update me so I asked again. Server said once more let me check up on it. 

By the time I received one thing I ordered, edamame, my daughter was all done with her meal. I asked the server to cancel the rest since she was done and I was over waiting but as soon as I was telling him that my two small rolls came out. 

Only thing I enjoyed about this place was that you can do half orders on tons of rolls for AYCE which is great if you want to try new rolls, other than that I would not come here to eat. There are so many AYCE sushi places with better service."}

{"text":"Was really excited to try a AYCE sushi place near to my house. Based on the 4 stars, I figured it'd be a great experience. WRONG! Sushi was very bland.  And I mean all the sushi. The nigiri,  the rolls, the hand rolls.  It had no fresh flavor and all the rolls tasted the same and were very mushy.  The servers were very friendly and pleasant,  however getting the food we ordered was a challenge and took too long. In fact there was one item we never got even though we asked several times.  Dessert choices were good and tasted good,  but I will definitely not be going back. I'm so spoiled by my regular AYCE place that this place failed miserably."}
{"text":"The food was good except service was horrible!! They completely ignored us for about 20 minutes after we placed our second order. Then we placed an order and waited and waited for it so asked about it. Turned out, they lost our order. So we were going to place an order and they had the nerve to tell us our time was up. Good luck ordering dessert. I don't think I'll come back again since there are other sushi places with much better service. I only came here because it was close to the house."}
{"text":"Ayce sushi  oh my!! We sat at the bar and watch them make our sushi nice and fresh.  The restaurant was very clean and well kept.  I don't have any complaints, just a list of the sushi I ate and what I'm coming back to eat.  
The restroom was clean.  

The waiters and waitresses were all responsible for clean up so they always made sure area was clean."}
{"text":"Our go to restaurant in our area. We're usually seated fast, and most of the waiters already know us. We always start off getting AYCE, the yum yum appetizer, rock and roll, tempura udon, super white are definitely staples. The service is awesome and that's why we keep coming back."}
{"text":"My sushi was not fresh and the owner, Rio was very rude. I told his waitress that the tuna was turning brown and was hard and she told me the owner wouldn't give me a refund and nothing was wrong. Absolutely insane - I've been going to this restaurant for 3 years and I'll never go again - I'm not an idiot, I love tuna and I know when it's been sitting around for a week. This place has really gone down hill. Too bad - but it's Tampa - lots of great sushi places to hit up like Sushi Blue."}
{"text":"It is so discouraging to see where the service industry has gone these days. First of all, there's hardly any parking in front of Kaizen. The reason why, we figured out, is because the employees take the only front spots available. That seems like just bad management to me. When we sat down, the beverage server was quick and helpful, but the food server was atrocious. She came to our table without us having to flag her down, only 1 time. The entire 90 minutes we were there, 1 time she came over. We asked for a side of ponzu sauce and she brought us soy sauce. We had to ask for refills of our drinks and she said yes, but didn't take our cups and just walked over to the beverage server and told her to help us. We liked the sushi, but it was hard to remember much more than the terrible service."}
{"text":"This is our favorite sushi place in town. Service is friendly, establishment is clean and inviting, and the food is delicious!  They are also open late!  This is a must try!"}
{"text":"This place is soooo delicious and affordable! The owner Jay is so personable and always makes us feel at home. The sushi chefs have great personalities and the wait staff are always on point. You can order half rolls here too which is great for someone who can only eat a couple pieces before getting full! We visit this place weekly!!"}
{"text":"The sake and beer were the highlight! Rice was overcooked. Fish tasted fishy, not fresh. Headed out to eat somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Not impressed! Took forever to get our food. Food didn't have much flavor. Rolls look great, but it's as if the sauces are either watered down or needs some flavor. Ehh perhaps some folks will enjoy this place if your pallet is ok with less spices and flavors etc. Good luck and enjoy."}
{"text":"Love coming here for the all you can eat.  They fill up my stamp cards for me; and, I get a free one every 10!! so I like to bring different friends and show it off! I'm a sushi snob; and, this place is quality!!!"}

{"text":"Food was good , nice presentation. Good atmosphere fun decor with the bamboo and paper lanterns. Service was average"}
{"text":"Kaizen has been my go to sushi place for quite a while now, but after my experience last night I'm hesitant to return. 

Usually I can deal with their somewhat bad service because I'm so wrapped up in how good the food is, but last night was a lose-lose & I left hungry & annoyed that I paid $27 plus automatic gratuity for my meal. 

One dish after another came out cold or poorly prepared. One of the first plates dropped at our table was the Snow White. As hungry as I was, I dove in without hesitation & was met with a nice large bone. I brushed it off, set the bone aside & moved on to the next dish, the Silver State, a baked roll with cream cheese, yamagobo, crab & some other yummy ingredients. Did I mention it was a baked roll? Yeah well, that came out cold.. Do you know how long a baked roll has to sit around outside the oven before it gets cold? About 7-10 minutes. How do I know this? I, too, work at a sushi place. 

After that came the pork belly... 2 pieces in an order. One piece came out warm & the other came out stone cold. The steamed gyoza came out slimy because it had been sitting in a plate of excess water. My miso was lukewarm. I DIDNT EVEN EAT MY TEMPURA ICE CREAM BECAUSE IT WASNT FRESH. Anything fried in oil needs to be served immediately to avoid becoming like a stale french fry! & my poor tempura ice cream was definitely a sad, stale, french fry.... :( 

For those brave enough to head out to Kaizen to try their luck please contact me because I have 10 stamps on my stamp card & I WILL NOT be back to claim my free meal."}
{"text":"FINALLY! We've found \"our\" go-to sushi spot in Henderson! I left my favorite sushi spot, Sushi Studio, in Long Beach, CA and nothing has been nearly as good (other than Nobu which we can only afford once a year and knocks EVERY other sushi restaurant out of the water). Checked out Kaizen last night with my husband and we were happily impressed. The fish was so fresh and the cuts were nice and thin, the flavors were great, loved the half roll options, and the price is right. I'm glad we took a chance, without a recommendation, and tried Kaizen. I don't easily give 5 stars, but when we go back to Kaizen, and it's equally as good as last night (showing consistency), my 4.5 stars WILL be 5."}
{"text":"Holy Great Sushi Batman!!! My new favorite spot of EVER. Not only do they have my favorite Japanese beers on draft (Asahi and Kirin), their nigiri is a small ball of rice and a fat cut of the softest, freshest fish I've ever had at a sushi place.
Flavors are bomb. 


Oysters,muscles, bacon wrapped skewers, sushimi and they have this Super White Tuna nigiri that's as soft as a pillow. Absolutely awesome.

A great assortment of desert items.
This is all on the All You Can Eat menu.

Many places are limited with AYCE vs their menu but this place offers almost 90% of the regular menu.

If you love sushi, this is the best spot in town by far."}
{"text":"Did the All You Can Eat (AYCE) on a Wednesday night and it was really good. Large selection of items and everything came out in a reasonable about of time."}
{"text":"Can someone please tell me why it's always deserted when my boyfriend and I come here? This place is great. Kaizen is one of the best sushi places in this area, without having to wait forever to be seated. 

Food: 
Nigiri: Let me just tell you, my boyfriend and I are huge on nigiri. 85% of what we order is nigiri. The fish here seems fresh. No weird fishy tastes going on here. It's all good, clean fish. I love ordering salmon nigiri, it's my favorite. Another thing that I enjoy from here is their super white tuna. I'll be honest with you, every other place that I've has super white tuna, I was not impressed. That all changed when I had it at Kaizen. Seriously, try it. It's the best super white that I've had so far. Oh and their Amaebi (Sweet Shrimp) is great. Good size, great taste. Did I mention they serve the fried heads with it? :D yum. 

Rolls: There are a wide variety of rolls to choose from. I make it a point to order at least one when I get AYCE. Though I haven't had a lot of the menu, I can tell you they have something for everyone. My boyfriend always orders half of the Monster Roll, which is huge by the way. 
There is a roll that I didn't particularly like, and it was the Something Spicy Roll. It was basically a rice heavy spicy salmon roll, covered in Siracha. Not very good.

Dessert: Great place to go if you have a sweet tooth. Along with the normal stuff, like mochi and tempura ice cream, they also have things like tepura cheesecake, green tea creme brûlée, and other yummy sweets. Don't forget to save some room for dessert!

Service:

The service is quite nice. The waiters and waitresses aren't the typical talkative, bubbly type, but they are very polite and attentive, which is fine by me. Based on the one experience I've had here with a large party, I don't think they are used to serving large parties. The server was still polite, but they seemed a bit overwhelmed by the amount of orders coming in at one time.

Overall, please try this place out! It's hardly ever busy when I come, and I'd love to see this place get more business."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for all you can eat lunch.  The rolls were great and I loved all my half rolls.  The restrictions on the menu are a little much, and confusing.  I got the monkey roll appetizer bc of reviews I read but mine tasted like a dried up salmon patty??? I was confused especially because it was almost $14 and 2 pieces.  Then, even though the place was NOT busy at all, our server kept disappearing! She got our drinks and appetizers and then NEVER came back! I'd see her walk across the restaurant and go into the back. So another server would pop by and refill our drinks and take our order.  Then at the end, she magically appeared again and brought our bill, then DISAPPEARED AGAIN!!! The other server came by 10-15 minutes later to run our cards.  To top off our experience,  I find out later that they (he or she) not sure which server, ran my card twice!!! We have the same bank card so they look the same.  She brought us both a receipt to sign so we didn't notice the mistake until my husband checked our acct online.  So, despite the service and error, the food was great and I would consider giving the place another shot.  Unfortunately, bored doesn't mean better when it comes to service."}
{"text":"We came here KAIZEN  for lunch AYCE.  Servers were friendly and fast.  Nice interior and atmosphere.  I would definitely come back here again.  Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Came here with the bf on a late Friday night-- was reluctant they opened til 1 am and has all you could get for $27 with buy one get one free drinks. The service was okay, if I came back I'd sit at the bar to get quicker service. Giving 3 stars for the quality of the food. They have a great selection but sushi and appetizers had a strange after taste to it. The only reason I'd be back is for the drink specials."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I chanced upon this place one night, during their sushi happy hour. The food was really good and the sushi chef was a really amazing korean gentleman who we had a really nice conversation with.

The hostess was very friendly as well, and the prices are definitely not that bad if you go during their special times."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite AYCE sushi restaurant! My boyfriend and I have tried many other sushi places but instantly regret not just coming to Kaizen. Their service is outstanding when they aren't too busy and they are always friendly. They are not stingy at all with their cuts for nigiri, and their fusion rolls are so delicious. The food is just always so delicious!! Many other restaurants limit you to one dessert option on the AYCE menu but Kaizen does not. If you want to be able to eat like you have two stomachs and still be treated kindly by the staff Kaizen is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like Kaizen because it was certainly lovely inside. But frankly, it just didn't do it for me. I've been there twice now, and while I certainly didn't have any BAD experiences, it just didn't wow me enough to justify the extra price. The rolls didn't really appeal to me as much. The service was fine, but it felt a little cold, which I found odd since it was pretty empty both times I was there. It's not like they were swamped. 

I might still give it one more chance, though."}
{"text":"Really good food! I always leave with a very full stomach. The prices are really good! I love the atmosphere here, but the service is always slow unless you're sitting at the bar. If you have to opportunity to sit at the bar, do so!"}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place thus far right now I'm back again an ready to tear it up with my peoples , love the rolls taste amazing very fresh an I'm ecstatic to be here once more"}
{"text":"Nice selection of rolls and a variety of Japanese food! Better to go during the day for lunch when the \"all you can eat\" is only $21 and and there's not too many people. I enjoyed my meal, but sometimes when I ordered something other than sushi, they wouldn't serve the full order? I get it's all you can eat and people over order, but if your menu says you serve it, then you serve it right? Unless you ask for half portions....which I didn't. They also charge you extra for what your don't finish, so make sure you don't over order!"}
{"text":"My son and I went in to try the lunchtime sushi having never been there before. We sat at the Sushi Bar and decided on the ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT and we did. The service was friendly and attentive. The chef was on it every time we reordered and he gave excellent suggestions.

By the time we had finished, we were so full it almost took a forklift to get us out of there. The food was excellent and we tried to finish it off with Green Tea Ice Cream. It was superb but we could not finish all of it.

I really do recommend Kaizen Fusion as a great place in the North end to get great sushi!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have dates here often. Their menu is amazing and $25 for all you can eat. It's always clean and the sushi is delicious. They always have good music on and sports on the TVs."}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to try a new a new sushi place.  Kaizen Sushi came through for us.  The rolls were very good, the decor set the mood for a great night out for the both of us.  The wait staff was on point tonight also.  They also have TEMPURA CHEESECAKE!!!  Great place to eat and will definitely come back for some more All You Can Eat."}
{"text":"I stopped in here after disappointment next door and had a good experience. I sat at the sushi bar and tried out there all you can eat which includes almost the entire menu.  It was a fun way to sample many different parts of the menu that I found interesting. Food and Sushi were good.  I would definitely go to one of my other spots if I wanted strictly sushi but this was very good for someone who's wanting to try several items on the menu or is hungry to eat a lot on a budget. I was seated right away the dinner rush was on and it was very noisy but that is to be expected in such an environment.  Nice experience I believe it would be a fun location to go with a group and like all-you-can-eat establishments they will charge you for uneaten food. I would definitely come again in a group setting, although probably not as a single or couple.  Very good place to visit if you're on a budget."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi at a surprising pace! First time there and I was not disappointed service from the waitress was awesome too, she would notice I'm about done with my last roll and swoop in for the next round by the time I was done with that roll she'd be walking up with the next one, clear the table and ask how everything is. When it got busier we didn't have to wait on her as the other waiter would take out over for her. Awesome team and management. 

They also have the \"benso box\" for all you non sushi eaters, there's a list for several entres you pick 2 , 4 California rolls, salad, soup and rice for just $14. 

We will definitely be back but watch out for the sexy roll it's hot af. Literally"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and the service (same server we had but had way better demeanor and more attentive this time) the last time we were there (about 2 months ago - late review). Hopefully it'll continue that way since we really enjoy this location. Planning to take my mom for her birthday this evening so we will see..."}
{"text":"My husband and I really loved this place, great cheap sushi, 2 for 1 drinks for happy hour... But then, the last time we were there, we were seated at a table next to the wall and a cockroach ran past my head. Needless to say, we haven't been back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here tonight to grab some sushi, right when we came in I noticed the place looked brand new and was well decorated. It got a bit busy and it seemed like there were servers running around everywhere and freaking out. We had to wait so long to get our check that we just walked up to the front since we didn't get it. The food was amazing but I just wish the servers were more personable and the restaurant wasn't so understaffed."}
{"text":"Kaizen never disappoints.  Never had a bad meal here. This has one of our favorite neighborhood sushi spots.  The fish is always fresh the staff is always polite and ready to help.  Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Salmon skin salad is crunchy and delicious! Place is clean and staff are so friendly. The tempura cheesecake and creme brulee wqs sooo good too!"}
{"text":"Their AYCE dinner is a little pricier than most. But the good and quality has been the same as any other spots I've been to. Pretty much your basic sushi spot. Nothing really stood out. The garlic tuna and super white sushi are good. They do have a lot of specialty roll options the nice thing is you have the option to get half rolls. Service was great tho!"}
{"text":"Just your everyday sushi place, but in a nice locale in North Las Vegas, near the soon to be built Aliante Station casino.  The lunch specials are decently priced for the amount of food you get (I ordered the Chicken Katsu/Tempura combination) - it was only like $7.99!

The interior is really nice, though.  High ceilings, interesting lighting fixtures over the sushi bar... being an architect, I appreciated it.  But it was a good spot for a nice, easy lunch."}
{"text":"This place is slow but I think it slow because they have to drive out to California fish for tuna and other fishes drive back and then prepare the food at least that's what it felt like they were doing.   Quality was OK for the price it was not worth it. They charge a lot more than most places so you would think they would be a lot better but they are average at best"}
{"text":"1st off... Bathroom... terrible. Service rude. All of the sushi looks as if it's falling apart when it reaches your table. The only good thing about it is the price of the food. Want sushi? Go find some near the strip. It's almost as if people come here just because of the fact that it's a sushi place"}
{"text":"I think the quality of food has declined recently and even got a little sick after eating there last time.  It's too bad because it used to be a great place!"}
{"text":"Went here this evening for dinner with a friend. Restaurant was full for a Friday night as expected. Had to wait 20 min or so for a table because I did not want to sit at the bar. Waitress offered us drinks while we were waiting which was nice. Once we were seated, drunk order was taken and brought quickly. We ordered appetizers, shishito peppers, seaweed salad, edamame, and shrimp tempura. They all tastes perfectly good. Except the shrimp tempura we had to ask for 3 times because it never showed up to our table. Also servers were kind of scattered, we had 3 different ones checking on us. Sushi was average quality for an ayce sushi place and didn't really stand out to me. Orange blossom roll was tasty and my favorite of the night. We then ordered banana tempura ice cream dessert that they had. Another issue was here because the bananas tasted like the shrimp that had been fried in the same oil as the bananas. That was a turn off. I personally have had better ayce sushi in Las Vegas and this place was at best low to mid range on my personal list."}
{"text":"I know this is a popular place but maybe because I went at the wrong time but my family & I were waiting at our table for almost 10 mins and no server came to greet us or take our order. I've seen a lot of servers walking back and forth not really doing anything. Only the guy that took our drink orders was very friendly but other than that I don't think I would ever come back here. It wasn't even busy so I wasn't sure why there was such a long wait on our table. Talking from a servers point of view because I am one, you should always greet your table & tell them you will be right with them but I've never had this bad of experience in my life."}
{"text":"Walking in I wasn't expecting much. 50% off lunchtime? Hmmm how good can this be? The menu had so many things on it, took me 20 minutes just to read thru! I chose a couple of specialty rolls & a spicy tuna salad. The salad was sooooo good I licked the plate clean! The rolls were creative, fresh & delicious! Wow what a pleasant surprise. Why isn't there a line outside to get in?
My mouth is watering right now as I think about the great meal I had at this restaurant.
Thumbs up from me."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!! I usually enjoy kaizen's food although their establishment located on eastern lacks good service, professionalism, quality, and cleanliness.  When getting my order wrong I had politely brought it to their attention. They then ignored me as I watched my newly made order sit for 10 min. When I had inquired about my meal they then decided it was time to bring it to me. I had a cockroach interfere with my dinning endeavor and they didn't do anything to compensate for it. On a seperate occasion my friend had a dead bug fall out of his napkin while I was with him during this disaster.  Lastly, their quality in fish is terrible and gave me food poisoning.

I have given this place many chances... but this city should know.. that if you are flying overseas as I will be doing so tomorrow.. you do not want poorly done fish and unhealthily prepared food that makes upchucking the boogie a possibility on the plane.. If that was the case I could've licked the bottom of my gym shoes and still felt better than I do now after consuming that toxicity.."}
{"text":"Delish. Always ready to take your order for AYCE. Fresh fish and even a sashimi option."}
{"text":"This is a fairly solid sushi bar. The fish is fresh, but the rolls are oversize. Service was polite and fairly quick.

Food 3.5/5
Service 4/5
Decor 2.5/5"}
{"text":"Been coming for years when I lived here. Now that we don't live here and haven't been back for 7 months all the staff still know me and take GREAT care of me and my friends. They gave the whole table (party of 12) sake on the house as well. Absolutely amazing sushi and great environment. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One of my fave ayce places :)

Sushi is very tasty, fresh tasting, high quality especially for an ayce 

Service is a bit spotty sometimes (they are very friendly, but sometimes slow, and sometimes they forget things or bring the wrong order)

Avoid the \"honey toast\"!!! It is just a roll cut open (NOT TOASTED!!), with ice cream and whipped cream on the side and caramel drizzled on top.  Not very tasty at all.  I feel Bad for anyone who orders this à la cart because it is sure not worth five dollars.  Honey toast can be sooo goood!!!! Theirs is not.

Order half rolls so u can try more items :)

Cant wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch specials and all you can eat. Come for the combo specials, they are a great way to get a taste of delicious hand crafted sushi at a small price. 
The all you can eat sushi is fun for a night out. There are plenty of nigiri and rolls to chose from. The appetizers and sashimi make it worth your while. 

They also have good drink specials for Sapporo, house sake, and wine. A great place for a date night or a fun night with friends. The more people the better because you can order more and try more variety. 

Favorite is the lunch special. Soup, salad and 2 specialty rolls for $15. It is always having us come back for more.

Don't take my word for it. Do yourself a favor and get some sushi here for a change."}
{"text":"Very good sushi and great japanese  cuisine for those who do not like raw fish. 

A bit pricey but worth it. Would certainly recommend Kaizen over any other sushi establishments in the NLV area."}
{"text":"This review is only about the service...

We had a group of 7 all getting AYCE. Our first order took about 25 minutes to come out. We figured that it took long cuz we ordered a lot. Then we made our second round of orders...They came it little by little over about 40 minutes. After an hour we still were missing half of our order. We had to talk to 3 (THREE!) separate waitresses asking what happened to our order. Still we didn't get our order. What the heck were they doing Everytime we spoke to them?! We're they not at least putting the order in again? Finally, after speaking to the manager did we get our food after a few minutes. This is how we definitely knew it was a problem with the service and not the chefs (they are great). Terrible service overall. No apologies for any of it."}
{"text":"Once again, this is a pretty good place for the roll style of sushi.

Ambiance - 5 Star - Very nice. trendy, clean, black motif, big TV playing cool stuff, neon signs with all the specials.  Right smack in middle is the sushi chefs all there of you to watch.

Food - 4 star - Had the kiss of fire ( jalepeno topped) roll, and Rainbow Roll.  I liked the fact that the jalepeno was cut so thin that it added a nice flavor to the roll instead of overwhelming the taste.  Rainbow roll was fine, nothing special. Was with the wife and had sushi earlier in the week, so I did not get my favorites to really compare this restaurant to the others,  However, it was good average sushi so I give it 4 star.

Chef - 4 star - We sat at the table at this one and Jay Kim was very nice and friendly.  Trained in Japan, I wonder how many others are trained in Japan.

Price - 4 star - For two rolls, two drinks, came up to like 35.00 with tip so it was okay, if a tad expensive. 

Nice place, nice team there, good bento boxes and other things to eat. Nice noodle choices as well.  Overall very nice and would come back."}
{"text":"This is a great all you can eat sushi spot. They have great variety of appetizers, rolls and desserts. I ordered the cucumber crab salad and the garlic edamame as an appetizer. I also ordered a variety of rolls. The appetizers were ok and the rolls were ok too. The best I have ever had? No. But pretty good quality for all you can eat. I really appreciated the option to order half a roll of sushi. That way I could get more variety without getting full on just 2 rolls. I ordered their house wine for $5 and it was ok. I was sitting close to the kitchen and I could see boxes of Franzia boxed wine...which makes me believe that is their house wine. 

For dessert I had their fried ice cream and cheesecake. The cheesecake was still kind of frozen...which makes me think they do not make it there. The ice cream as pretty good. 

Overall, I think it's pretty good. I would go back again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I eat here for lunch all the time, they have great lunch specials.  Their bento boxes are the best deal - they come with soup, salad, rice, sometimes tempura vegetables, sushi, and teriyaki chicken, beef or salmon.  They've changed their menu and have new stuff on their lunch menu as well.  I wouldn't say their sushi is GREAT, but it is good.  

It's a classy looking restaurant, the decor is pretty, nice place for an evening date.  It's fun to come and sit at the sushi bar with a friend.  Easy to have a conversation, it's a quiet place.   At least during the daytime, the service is mediocre."}
{"text":"I didn't realize that I reviewed this place already but who cares I love this place so here we go...

I have been to Kaizen multiple times since living in Las Vegas and every visit gets better and better. 
I order the shiitake mushroom rolls, veggie tempura and make it an all you can eat (call me greedy but I like it) sometimes I'll order other vegan options but I know what I want and every time it is served it makes me want it more and more. 
Unfortunately the goodness of their food is not the sole reason for awesomeness of this restaurant. 
Every time we have visited Kaizen we've been waited on by a woman who we call Pear. She is the ABSOLUTE best waitress I have ever encountered in my life time. I have never been waited on by a waitress who remembers not only our names but what we ate, what we liked, what we didn't like, our preferences, my vegan lifestyle, where we like to sit and she greets us as if we're all friends. She makes this place a treat to be at. 
Unfortunately the other waitresses at Kaizen do not appear share this enthusiasm but they could always improve and they aren't horrible but they also aren't great either. 
Pear appears to take her job very seriously, she seems to understand the value of customer service and she utilizes it to perfection. 
We have been to Kaizen on two other occasions and we had a different waiter the last time we went. I don't remember her name but it's probably because I literally couldn't hear her voice, her table attendance was unsatisfactory but miraculously PEAR showed up midway through our visit and she assisted us tremendously. Hopefully the other waitress took notes on how Pear did her job. 
Also, last but DEFINITELY not least. The cooks at Kaizen are simply AMAZING, I am probably the King of returning my food due to mishaps and miscommunications on my orders but I have NEVER returned a plate at Kaizen (i don't want to jinx myself) it's highly unlikely though as these cooks have absolutely perfected this cuisine. I love this place and I strongly recommend you go and try it especially if you're vegan. This is one of the rare moments where I can fully enjoy sushi that I actually REALLY like. 
Thank you Pear for your outstanding service and efforts and thank you Kaizen for your existence and location (really close to my home )
I will definitely be returning for my shiitake mushroom rolls and vegetable tempura."}
{"text":"After a few years I decided to give this place another shot ...I was super craving sushi after church and didn't want to drive that far...

I ended up living on the edge and not only returning to a place that I had never planned to give my $ and second I ate at the sushi bar which is rare for me ..

I'm glad I did I ended up getting a really good bang for my buck and my rolls came out fast and my sushi chef was super nice .. He has a difficult name to pronounce but he said his nick name is achoy (forgive my spelling) anyhow for the price I really enjoy my rolls I got 
Rock & Roll* really enjoyed this one a lot no rice only available as full roll
Half salmon killer * tasty 
Half lemon roll* my fav roll anywhere I go (yes I'm
Basic )
half mango salmon - this one was unique 
Half sunrise - enjoyed this one 
Half orange blossom - tasty 

I think I maybe am missing some of the rolls but either way great variety and you get a decent amount of time to dine, the servers and bus people are much friendlier than the time I first tried this place ..

I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"Best All You Can Eat Sushi in town. Friendly staff and great food. Also, they just updated their desert menu."}
{"text":"Came in several yrs back and they took our pic. . It's still there which is awesome.  I enjoy coming here.  Love the desert and the orange blossom sushi. I highly suggest going there to hang out or with group of friends.  If you don't to watch the game you could watch the music videos which is entertaining."}
{"text":"Came here around 10:00 on a Saturday night. I ordered a vegetable tempura roll and a mushroom roll. Both were bomb!! I also ordered a lychee saketini since they had a BOGO drink deal. It was amazing!!! The 2nd drink I got was a pineapple saketini which was also great! Good food, great service, amazing drinks. I plan to come back for their $10 lunch specials!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I love everything that we tried. We had sushi as well as the baked mussels, whole mackerel and the creamy shrimp with Wasabi sauce. Everything was so good. My boyfriend is a very picky eater, his family also owns some thai as well as susi reataurants so he is hard to please. He loved the food at Kaizen though. The service was also excellent. I am from Maryland but I would definitely return to Kaizen on my next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"When our usual spot was too busy, we called over here and we're seated immediately (party of 5). All you can eat was a great deal and everything was yummy!!! Decent sized rolls too! Only thing is I wish there had been another option to Free Sake/beer w facebook check in...since I don't drink either of those and we had 3 non drinkers."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing. Service is horrible. Took 3 mins to get a drink but 15 minutes to order and wasn't even from our server. Almost 20 mins already just sitting here at the table with everyone walking by. This happens all the time when I come here to eat.

Also just noticed we were served without utensils.

Food was great. Servers started touching tables more.
Still bad service.

Waiting for the past 6 mins for a check."}
{"text":"This place is so bomb!!!!!im literally taking a break from eating right now just to leave this review...service is good and food is phenomenal"}
{"text":"The environment is nice. The staff is nice and on top of their game. I love to see the staff ready to order your next round on all you can eat when I'm ready - other places I have to flag them down. Huge menu selection for all you can eat. On the downfall, the sushi didn't taste fresh, my stomach regretted it later. And, when we checked out, I handed her the card so she didn't have to get the itemized receipt, and when I went to sign my name, I realized it was higher than normal. After looking at the itemized receipt, I was charged twice for all you can eat. She fixed it on the spot and apologized plenty."}
{"text":"I decided to take my family here for my brothers birthday celebration . Their service was horrible & they kept forgetting our order and we got our orders 10 minutes later . I almost forgot I placed my order and by the time i got my order i was already full. I would not suggest this place if you have any bigger parties more than 5 they will not be attentive to your party ."}
{"text":"Definitely do the all you can eat sushi however they do take a long time to get it out. But they're screaming orgasm salad is amazing! It could be considered a little hole in the wall but it is romantic and casual at the same time & prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Drinks are the reason to come to this sushi bar. Wide variety of martinis, the lychee martini is to die for! AYCE is a great addition and keeps me coming back. I now alternate between here and Sushi Tachi."}
{"text":"So, I walk in at 9:00 p.m. order a large Kirin chicken katsu a la carte and 2 ayce. Make my all you can eat order consisting of 2 half rolls and 4 nigiri rolls....then this bitch says at 9:15 what else would you like it's last call. I said damn you should've fucking told us that so we didn't  pay for all-you-can-eat for $28. She was rude about the situation and then reluctantly gave us our chopsticks and wasabi AFTER our rolls were on the table. I hope the owners review their cameras and see how FUCKED up we were treated. And she walks out at 9:35 without a care in the world. NO WONDER THIS LOCATION HAS BAD RATINGS."}
{"text":"Awesome all you can eat yummy & sake. Good fresh and my fav sushi place."}
{"text":"I only have one experience with this restaurant and unfortunately I never even received my food, so this one-star rating is solely based on customer service (or complete lack thereof). I recently had surgery that has left me homebound, so delivery food is my only current option. I stumbled upon Kaizen on Postmates, and was very excited to satiate my sushi craving- the prices were reasonable and the delivery fee was reasonable. I placed a large order and settled into excited anticipation for my delivery. 10 minutes before it was to be delivered, I received an email from Postmates that my order had been cancelled, with no further explanation. I immediately called the restaurant to inquire whether they knew the cause of the cancellation- they were unsure, although they had called the Postmates driver to ask about a specific item preparation and suggested the driver call me to verify. I assume (because I never received a call) that the driver just cancelled my order instead. Unfortunately, 90% of the order had already been made, and Wade (who answered the phone at Kaizen) became accusatory, suggesting that the cancellation was my fault, insisting I replace the order immediately for future delivery- I was trying to explain that I didn't think placing a new order and waiting for another driver would fit into my timeline for the day- but was unable to fully communicate this, as Wade was impatiently interrupting me at every thought. I am extremely disappointed to have been treated that way as a customer, and know for certain they will never again receive my business. Shame on you, Kaizen."}
{"text":"This place has the freshest tuna and fish. Their all you can eat buffet is well worth they money and they don't fill you up with sushi buried in rice. Tuna melts in your mouth. I love their crab and cucumber salad. The crab salad is flavorful and the cucumber make it a refreshing start before your sushi starts coming out. My favor server is Krystin. She is so friendly and attentive and always has a smile on her. For 26 bucks you can't beat that value, ambience and service. It's a place where all the working class locals go and there is never and riffraff in this place. be sure to check their daily catch of the day and specials. Garlic tuna is superb."}
{"text":"pro's and con's list...

PROS:
-quick and friendly service
-fresh quality fish
-AYCE menu
-buy one drink, the other 1/2 off (not sure if everyday but it was offered when we dined)
-nice clean atmosphere, not too crowded, dim romantic feeling lighting
-large selection of rolls, nigiri, side orders, drinks etc.

CONS:
-upon arriving at the restaurant,.. sorry to say.. it just plain smelt like farts, which lasted the whole dining experience. had I not eaten here before knowing it has good fresh food, I probably would have left. Doesn't help if trying for a first time impression .
not sure where the smell came from, so wasn't the most exciting thing to have lingering while trying to eat.

if the smell had not been there, this place deserves a 5"}
{"text":"This was once my go to for neighborhood sushi. The place has gone downhill. It's in desperate need of a good cleaning! I grossed out with the torn and dirty seats. Not to mention the trash between the seats and the wall. Never again."}
{"text":"Since moving here we have been searching for a favorite sushi spot that does not require driving to the strip from NLV.  I have seen Kaizen before, its in our shopping center. We did a quick check on Yelp and saw a wide variety of mix reviews so we continued to look elsewhere. 
 Sunday night we decided to give them a shot, its close to home and we wanted to try something new. We walked in and were pleased with the decor, very nice, clean and simple. Much better than expected. We were greeted immediately and seated at the table of our choice. The table was clean, we were quickly handed menu's, water, and plates. Our server took our drink order without making us wait. (very nice BTW)
  The menu was clean, easy to follow and read with some good quality pictures of selected items. We saw a appetizer that sounded great (Crispy Rice with spicy tuna), we placed that order while we figured the rolls we wanted. We ordered three rolls as our appetizer arrived. The portion was bigger than expected, the tuna was fresh and very luscious. As we finished our app. the busser was on point and cleared our plate. Our rolls began to arrive, I am sorry we can not remember the names but each was very tasty, fresh and well flavored. 
 We had a good time, enjoyed our food and took time to sit and enjoy the second Asahi and sake we were provided because it was happy hour. When it was all said and done, we ordered an appetizer, three rolls, two large Asahi beer's, and two large Sake for $70.00.
  We will return, there were many other rolls we wanted to try. I have learned to not allow a few negative review's to steer us away, we loved it. We gave four of five stars for one reason and one reason only...We have a hometown favorite Sushi restaurant back in Windso,r California named  \"Ume Sushi\" They are THE BEST!!! and missed friends."}
{"text":"My gf and I come here on the regular. It's very close to our home and it's a great for us to great our Japanese fix on. Always a great time there."}
{"text":"Honestly, I have enjoyed this place many times in the past...but tonight had a horrible experience. The place was busy but shouldn't be an excuse for bad customer service. Also my first order was lost amd finally came the salmon was terrible...I actually spit it out on my plate. I hope this is not the new standard."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi, and so many interesting specialty rolls! We left stuffed and for a great price for what you get. Highly recommend the BBQ and the \"Ice Cream\" rolls!"}
{"text":"A few friends recommended this place so my husband and I decided to try it. The service felt rushed. If they would slow down and make you feel welcome I'd give it five stars because the sushi is awesome. We had edamame to start. I always get a cali roll but The Palm Springs roll is hands down my favorite! I will come back just for that roll! The fried cheesecake and $5 sake bombs are awesome too!"}
{"text":"Good late night sushi joint with tons of rolls to choose from. I'm kind of a minority meaning I'm not a huge fan of sushi so this is one of the few places I enjoy. The service is good and the staff is friendly. They now have all you can eat! My favorites are: Japanese Lasagne, avocado train and the fried rice (white boy). Come check it out!"}
{"text":"Where's the option for six stars. Word to the wise, sit at the bar!!! Honestly never eaten that much at an all you can eat venue. Recommendation after recommendation from both sushi chefs were blowing us away. Sitting outside after paying and not driving away until we finish writing this review because -from the hospitality service to the many blends of flavors they were stuffing down our throats- this is a new kind of fulfillment. Genuinely food happy at the moment. Aside from wanting to cancel our plans for the rest of the night and give way to the inevitable food coma, I feel great. Can't wait to come back ASAP. Who needs rent money."}
{"text":"Took me a few times to see what the Henderson hype was about kaizen!!! A little disorganized but there's one particular server who nails it everytime! HUAN, you da realist! He's very attentive and pays attention to detail. He's the only one that we've experienced that checks to make sure all orders are accurate and comes out in a timely fashion! And we come here at least once a week! Very much earned out title of being regulars! 

Enough about the service. Let's talk about the foooooodd:

Must get items: 
Yellowtail/salmon sashimi 
Garlic tuna nigiri
Toro nigiri
Super white Nigiri
ORANGE BLOSSOM ROLL (phenomenal)
Unicorn roll (yuuummm) 

We would live and die happy with the orange blossom roll. That tangy sauce, whatever you may be, just completes me!"}
{"text":"I finally found a good place on this side of town!!! Service was very good & the rolls were excellent. I liked that most of the rolls can be ordered in 1/2 size so you can try different ones. I had 4 different ones & they were all delish!!! The plum wine was served in a very cold wine glass which was a huge plus. The restrooms were very clean & the restaurant was nicely decorated. I will definitely return, this is my new go to dpi on the North end of town..."}
{"text":"Went yesterday for the first time for a birthday. The sushi selection was great and the food was great but the service could use some improvement. Literally every time we asked the waiter a question, his answer didn't have anything to do with the question. Or he would repeat his answer from a previous question like he was a record stuck on repeat. Obviously there is a language barrier with him or he just doesn't bother listening to the customers. In which case, either way, he needs to get a different job. 
Also we were charged gratuity for 6 people (5 adults/1child) on our 3 person ticket so he got way more of a tip then he deserved."}
{"text":"We have been here before about a year ago and have been unhappy with the service.  The service was much improved and the rolls were very good.  They might have the best spicy tuna roll for the money.  Food came promptly even though they were fairly busy, table was kept clean, and waitresses were attentive.  Would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Nothing will compare to the original Jjanga on Decatur (original owners) but this place is so much closer and comparable to the new Jjanga imo. The restaurant is small and, as the best ayce sushi nearby, is often crowded. Service can be incredibly slow but is friendly. Quite a bit of the menu is not available for ayce or is only 1 per person which is super annoying. However the quality of the food is good and I really enjoy the different rolls they have created (except for the fruit ones- they're nasty). And I will also give them props for a much more extensive dessert menu then any other sushi place I've been to."}
{"text":"Call me a sushi snob, but I am very particular about my AYE sushi places. A girlfriend of mine recommended we eat at this place, since its just around the corner from my house. This is located on Coronado center and Eastern, Easy to find , and plenty of parking.

Ambiance of the place is great, the staff is friendly and the place is clean! 3 things I look for when I walk into a restaurant.

Their all you can eat menu you selection was bizarre ! I love how there was so much sushi selections and non sushi entrees you can choose from.

I pretty much devoured the Nigiri  , since i was on a so called diet and Nigiri only has two pieces rather than an entire roll. I must say the Nigiri was to die for. Temperature was great and the texture was perfect. The Nigiri had no veins, it was all fish. :)

As for their non sushi items , they had of course the common Gyoza, Skewers, MIso Soup and I love their Ahi Poke salad ( I highly recommend you order this). And if you love mussels their mussels are fresh has they can be.

We ended our dinner by ordering a red bean ice cream and of course a strawberry mocha.

I love this place , this is my new AYE top places to eat for sushi."}
{"text":"Service a little slow at times but worth the wait.  Food is amazing.  Sit at the bar for a great experience."}
{"text":"One stupid evening I cater to my friends whim of sushi night out. Lets all hang out and do all you can eat sushi they say. I say ok since they mention sushimon and I never went there before. But I heard good things about it. Half way coming down from the freeway they call me up and says, hey change of plan, we going to kaizen instead. Sushimon is packed to the bone, 50 minutes wait, I aint gonna wait 50 minutes for sushi.

So we roll into kaizen and its absolutely spot on. Granted I was skeptical at first cos I never heard about this place before, but I guess my friends made a great choice. We were there for good 2 hours just eating and conversing, sake and beers later, the waitress still very nice to my stupid friend who keep asking her out. Good experience. Great sushi, and absolutely must try."}
{"text":"i tried the lunch AYCE. Boy was i stuffed. I completely forgot sushi normally comes with 2 pieces so I ordered double....and yes I ate ALL OF IT.
FOOD:
beef tataki - not the greatest, more cooked than i would like. 
shrimp tempura - 2 dinky piece ---i could do without. no flavor really. it was crunchy. the dipping sauce was bland.
seafood pancake - I had a small bit of this. it tasted burnt to me. Idk
miso soup - lots of flavor. I really liked this. plenty of seaweed in it also
Soft Shell Crab appetizer - it has mustard on it. i did not like. but my friend really enjoyed it. i was supposed to have sweet potato in it. I didn't taste it though. maybe it was just the bite i got.

sushi: it was decent. fish wasn't the frsh
Salmon  - 3 orders --- i love salmon so it hit the spot
Halibut - 3 orders  ---super fishy. i was not impressed
Ono - 2 orders --- def love a place that has this fish. nice and buttery.
Salmon Skin Hand Roll --- there was skin all the way to the bottom. A-OK! would have scarfed down more of this if i ordered less of the sushi
Albacore Sashimi - 2 piece --- the onion crisp on it was a nice touch. it was perfectly seared. yummy. i say order it!

Tempura Ice Cream -- cannot go wrong with this. it hit the spot. but the tempura batter. i really dont know what it is but it was not as good as it could be. probably just used a plain tempura batter. other places i know add some sweetness to the batter. 

Will i come back? probably. would i suggest to go here. not really. It wasn't amazing. I definitely have had better AYCE sushi places. My friend i was with really likes this spot. I'm sure she will drag me back here."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5
Service 1/5
Cleanliness 4/5

 We went to the bar hoping we get fast service but it was the total opposite of what we intended to have. Waited for our food for a looooong time. Even when we ordered dessert, we have to asked them twice to get it.. then when we got our check, they charged us for something else we didn't order. She said she can't void it anymore so she'll just give us free soda on our next visit.."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the all you can eat menu has options for everyone. The staff was nice but the service was a little slow and therefore I only gave a 3 star."}
{"text":"Love the service and dig the food. Everything I've ever had was delicious I love the Orange Blossom Roll and can't get enough of the bacon wrapped asparagus. Oishi!!"}
{"text":"Kaizen Fusion can satisfy any AYCE sushi lover!!
They offer the most diversity of sushi types ranging from small plates, sashimi, and special & fried rolls. For the AYCE options these guys provide a lots to choose from, unlike other places where they only give you certain part of the menu.

I came in a few times for dinner and this place gets packed, luckily for two people waiting time isn't long. I can just tell you from the stuff I've ordered was pretty darn delicious!!
Most notable: Philadelphia Roll, Mexican Fiesta Roll, Japanese Lasagna, and the Avocado Train. 

So I what did I only give 3 stars, specifically 3.5, it's the service.  
On occasion in between meals, it didn't matter how simple or complex, some items came quick others came slow. I wish there was a set of reasonable expectation so at the end of night, I wouldn't feel confused whether I got the most of what I paid for. 

I would still recommend Kaizen just for the sushi, if you an avoid this pitfall."}
{"text":"As a AYCE fanatic of sushi this place is definitely my favorite. I love the rock an roll roll and they fatty belly tuna. I have sat here with friends and devoured 26 rolls. (Don't judge). The only reason why I give it 4 stars out of 5 is because every time I try the mochi it taste like freezer burn. But I'll cut out desert and keep coming back for the sushi which tastes fresh each time I've came!"}
{"text":"I took lunch here, I choose AYCE, many varieties, food was very tasty and the service was just amazing. the staff was very friendly and professional. We only sat for few minutes before the first order was already on the table. 
thank you for being nice and professional!"}
{"text":"The food was good and service was very friendly. The bus boys were on top of everything. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Kaizen was my first AYCE sushi visit in town.  I will say on the one hand, if I totaled up all my items as if I ordered ala carte, then I definitely saved money.  Just beware that when they say $26.95, it's really more like $37 after tax and auto added tip.

I liked the spice on a few of my rolls but others came off as just average.  The tuna poke was solid but it was the first time I've had that so I can't say if it was better or worse than other tuna poke.  A friend I was with  said this place had nothing on places in her hometown, which happened to be a fish mecca (Seattle), so it's a tough comparison.

The true grade of Kaizen is TBD as I continue to expand my footprint in LV cuisine."}
{"text":"What a lousy experience! Low quality Sushi, Premium price, Slow service, and food ordered never brought after asking twice. Friendly servers. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I love you guys!! You tha best sushi in town! See ya again very soon. Count like Monday afternoon"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi in North Las Vegas that's decent?!!! It's getting four stars!"}
{"text":"Kaizen Fusion Roll and Sushi is a good neighborhood sushi restaurant where you have the option to order Ala Carte or All You Can Eat.  They have a good variety of hot and cold appetizers like soft-shell crab, tako yaki, and raw oysters.  They have all the basic nigiri like salmon, ikura, hamachi, and ahi; and also creative rolls with various fillers, like California or shrimp tempura inside and different toppings like spicy ahi, unagi, and sauces on top the rolls.

The All You Can Eat is a good value as the Ala Carte plates can add up quickly.  The interior is modern and pretty, and for better or worse has TVs throughout the dinning room showing sports and playing music videos.

Take your time (you get 1.5 hours for the All You Can Eat), enjoy the company, and eat a lot of pretty decent sushi for an affordable price."}
{"text":"Fresh sushi, smaller than other places.
Good for AYCE to give you more room to try other items.  Not so good for A la carte, each order approx $5-$6."}
{"text":"Great selection of sushi on the all you can eat menu. delicious udon soup as well. Very friendly efficient service"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi, friendly chefs, huge selection of rolls, sushi, and sashimi.  Super fresh fish. My favorites are Super White Tuna sushi and Pastel Roll.  The super white Tuna melts in your mouth, for real.  I pounded 3 Pastel rolls today for lunch.  my. god.  I just earned my first free meal with their rewards program.  I'll be back soon!  Highly recommend this place.  AYCE FTW."}
{"text":"This is the biggest ripoff when it comes to \"all you can eat sushi\". They might as well call it \"All you can eat rice\". I'm baffled that this has 4 stars. Obviously most of you do not venture outside N. Vegas for good sushi. Try driving 20 minutes south, well worth it. I've had better sushi at Albertsons! You've been warned."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AWSOME!!! yesterday I went to kaizen for the first time. I went around 7pm it was busy but the waiter Jay was on task with other waitress and the sushi chef were very friendly. Five star to this restaurant!! Also they have a happy hour which is 6pm to close everyday buy one get one free!!! sushi and sashimi prices is reasonable and eric's special rolls were great! He asked me what I liked and he made me a roll with a great presentation!!!  I recommend to everyone!! i'll see you guys soon!!!"}
{"text":"Chilean Seabass on point. Miso Glaze: perfect. Fish: amazing. 

No complaints"}
{"text":"Very good. And not that crazy crowded. We all like this place. 
Be sure to check in this place so that you can get free drinks.
We get in here at 7pm, Saturday, and it is not crowded. After 10 minutes, a lot of people came in...so, I guess the best time to get in is before 7pm. 
The boss is very nice. 
The strawberry drink is very good."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas. The all you can eat dinner is all I've ever hay and it costs about 28$. Well worth it for the variety and freshness of the seafood. My favorite is the energy roll. I like this place because it's open late, and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"Being a frequent customer, I would have to say I really enjoy being around the corner from my house after an AYCE coma !

10/2016 Updated review. Super upset that they charged us for left overs when we forced ourselves to eat everything. She said they found it in the middle of the plates when i can swear to you we ate EVERYTHING to not have to pay."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews on Yelp, so I decided to try it.  They have a 50% off menu, which has a California roll, and some other tempura rolls.  They also have just nigiri sushi - 2 pieces on that menu.  Avg. price per roll $3.50 - $4.00 so not too bad.  The yellowtail sushi was great.  The California roll was not.  It's pretty hard to mess up a California roll, but this one just didn't taste right.  It was basically a big chunk of crab, and not the usual shredded crab and avacado.  Also, they had no Philly roll on the 50% off menu, and not too many other interesting rolls.  They had some on the full price menu, but I'd rather go to an AYCE place for that, and Kaizen doesn't offer any AYCE menus."}
{"text":"I've been a lover of Kaizen for some years now. I started at the one by the hard rock after working late on weekends. When i found out there was one close to home i was all over it! The happy hour is killer for dinner and drinks. The service has always been great. Ontida is the best!"}
{"text":"Food was nice however they are as usual out of hamachi and salmon kama.  Otherwise ok."}
{"text":"We love this place.  Great service and quality AYCE Sushi.  Come here more than a few times a year.  Thanks Kaizen!"}
{"text":"With the owners of En Sushi out of town, we were looking for a place to pop in to get some rolls and sashimi in our area. We sat at the sushi bar and found the sushi chefs to be polite and fun. Beef tataki was on special, but it was just *eh*. I found it odd that they sold yellowtail belly specifically as a markup, but I can say it was delicious! Fresh and tasty. We tried a few rolls of the menu and found them all to be big, sloppy, and saucy. I do prefer my rolls tight and neat and I do like tasting fish. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing but I feel like every roll was just a mess on my plate covered in way too much sauce. 

They are open late and they have fresh yellowtail - I will be back, but only when I can't get to En and I'll avoid the sloppy rolls next time."}
{"text":"Definitely our go to sushi spot in town! So glad we were able to find an AYCE sushi place since Reno only offers AYCE and we just moved! Tried a few other places here in Las Vegas since our move, but this is definitely the best, by far! On top of the amazing rolls, our service has always been superb. If you eat here, try the Screaming O Salad! That sauce is everything. I save it to dip my sushi in afterwards."}
{"text":"Initially I was going with one star to correlate with the three 1D (which I believe means one direction though I'm not going to do any followup on my theory) videos that were played in succession after we sat down- but luckily the vibe changed and the music selection normalized.  But they seem to do triple plays for each band.

The food is consistent with other 4 star all you can eat sushi spots.  

Oh Christ they are playing Happy, I can't continue this review.

Food is good.
Big screen music needs work."}
{"text":"We are loyal Kaizen regulars but tonight was specifically bad from the beginning.  I don't know if they no longer offer training to young servers but this was bad.  We waked in and as the gal is looking around for a table for us a delivery guy comes in behind us and she proceeds to tell us to move.  1st I'm pretty it's universal not to take your deliveries in the front door.  Then she sat us in one table only to move us to another.  We saw a different waitress for our order then, once for delivery, no check of how it was and then we had to flag her down for the check.
Food is always great but they need a manager!"}
{"text":"This has become Bubs and my go to sushi place. The idea of \"desert fish\" used to make me nervous, but I have never gotten sick eating here. We like to sit at the bar; direct attention and it's cool to watch the rolls get made. Never had a problem with service. 

We like to throw down when it comes to sushi, so it's rare to find us somewhere that doesn't have AYCE. This one is $28 a person at dinner time. I love that you can order half portions of most of the rolls. Allows for more diversity before you get too full. Not all of the rolls are 5 star amazing, but they do have some really good ones. We we're partial to the Vampire roll, Crazy Girl, and Snow Corn. Be warned, the spicy tuna with Sriracha is pretty damn hot!"}
{"text":"It was around 3pm, 2 parties in the house. The waiter was unresposive, did not say hello and did not want to deal with questions"}
{"text":"Had to drop my review to 3 stars because:

- AYCE price increased
- Presentation of rolls are lacking and are messy, falls apart when you grab them
- Waiter stopped serving my family towards last half of service... Uh, we still wanted to order more rolls!
- Found our waiter eating...?
- Dessert menu is now limited to only 2 per person (that's not considered AYCE)
- Water wasn't refilled

*Gordon Ramsay voice* What a damn sham."}
{"text":"Came in yesterday to continue my sis' birthday festivities and seriously, what a disappointment! The Nigiris were nowhere near fresh, the uni looked old, the service was not as attentive, and just everything was not how it used to be! I used to love this place and talk highly about it, now? I have nothing to say but maybe stick to everything cooked, if that's what you like to order at Japanese establishments. I refuse to come back unless my sister tells me otherwise. And that's if she decides to give it another try."}
{"text":"Sushi is good. Average price in Las Vegas for it. But my god the staff is horrible. They will forget something every single time and are not very friendly. They have an everyone help every costumer approach when it comes to serving which I imagine is most of the confusion."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I am very picky when it comes to Japanese food because my family owned a Japanese restaurant for 20 years.  I know what good sushi tastes like and this place comes as close to it.  I have never been to the other Kaizens around the city but this place is really good.  My favorite is the bentos that they have for lunch, super cheap for a good amount of food.   They also had a special last time I went of yellowtail collar with rice.  It was so good.  The yellowtail meat was so soft and tender.  And for $7.50, I had enough to bring home.  I just order their mixed salad and the yellowtail and that was a great complete meal.  One of the best things I love about this place is that they have korean bbq ribs.  I know this is a sushi place but the korean bbq ribs are so good.  I have had a lot korean bbq and again this place delivers.  You can get it in the lunch bento for $7.50.  I would really recommend this place for lunch.  The regular price stuff is a little more pricey than what I am used to. (Though I am used to free sushi from my family's restaurant, so I may not be the best judge.)"}
{"text":"It's hard to find an AYCE sushi place that will do things the way you like. Loved everything we tried and the service was good! Definitely returning."}
{"text":"Update to the review below: Received some wonderful and unusual extras in the sashimi plate I ordered. Some of the 'safe' regular fish, but also some nice extras added like super white tuna and uni. I had uni once before and didn't like it at all, but now I realize it is because the first time I had it, it musn't have been fresh. At Kaizen, the uni was really tasty! I'm glad I now know the difference! Thanks, guys!

Great service, great food. Was also given a free taste of leechee-flavored sake which was wonderful, and may just replace my staple glass of plum wine! My sashimi plate was fresh and very artfully arranged. Atmosphere was light and airy, popular music videos play on a big-screen TV and it isn't obnoxiously loud. One qualifier: I did go during lunchtime and it was not busy at all, I'll have to see how it is during a busy night and at that time I'll update this review. Suffice to say, it is nice to find some great sushi in nlv!"}
{"text":"My family and I come here twice a month because it is the best sushi place! Not only are they close to home, but they serve the tastiest sushi. Johnathon is always our waiter and knows what we want before we sit down! I recommend the Jackpot roll with a side of eel and soy sauce to dip in."}
{"text":"I love going to this sushi restaurant! Great specials! Good food!"}
{"text":"I've been on the hunt for a new sushi place nearby since Sin City Sushi closed down. We decided to give Kaizen a try. My expectations coming in were low and the reality was no better.

$26 for AYCE dinner. We got two rolls, which were incredibly bland. Rather than fill up on more blah rolls, we ordered quite a few appetizers and nigiri to make up for it. Some of their selections on AYCE are one order per person, which is pretty normal, but in the case of the nigiri (which is usually at least two pieces), they will just give you a single sliver of whatever it is, like with the fatty tuna. So not much of a chance to experience it. Most of the nigiri was pretty decent, but the squid was tough and almost slimy! It took a serious effort of will to get it down and I usually like squid. The texture has been haunting me all day the following day.

The service was a little impersonal, but quick and polite enough. There are a dozen sushi places up and down the few miles of Eastern stretching from the 215 to Anthem. Most of them are mediocre at best and I include Kaizen in that. I don't know how they all stay open. With 2 AYCE dinners, plus one large beer, and a $12 tip, our tab was just under $80. $80 for a blah meal just isn't going to cut it, so the search for a good sushi joint continues."}
{"text":"I prefer the paradise location over this one. For some reason every time I order from this location it doesn't taste good but when I order at the paradise location it tastes just fine. This is my 3rd time giving this place a try and I regret it each and every time."}
{"text":"Out of all the crappy AYCE sushi restaurants we have on the North side, I'll have to say that Kaizen is one of the least crappiest. Still pretty crappy though. I'd rather drive down to Chinatown or something for quality sushi, than preserve my gas and settle for Kaizen. 
What's even worse than the sushi is their service. They were like chickens with their heads cut off. It took forever to actually get a server to take our orders, but once we did, they'd forget about them! The only waitress there that seemed like she knew what she was doing was Katherine. She was attentive, she apologized for the long waits, and for the orders that they forgot to give us. AND she was the only one who was friendly. All the other girls had such sour expressions on their faces. 
2 out of 5 because they're not completely horrible. Definitely not expecting myself to ever go back though."}
{"text":"I think I ate a dead dog mixed with mayonnaise.

If you miss mystery food from Public School days, then this is your place."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi! I had been trying to find a place in Vegas that would make comparable Donald ducks nigiri (which is apparently a Reno only thing). At first they looked at me like I'm crazy but after I showed them a picture they got it and replicated it to perfection. The atmosphere was great and the sushi was great as well! The staff was friendly and attentive.

I've definitely found my sushi spot in Vegas now!"}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time way back when they first opened and did not offer AYCE. I've never seen this place get busy so, there's usually just 1 or 2 servers working. On my last visit, the server didn't even bother introducing herself - ok, fine. But what aggravated me was that she tried ignoring me every time I want to order more food. She was quick grabbing my empty plates and before I could even open my mouth to place another order, she's already gone - seriously?

The food here is pretty good. I tried some of their rolls, skewers and some nigiri from their AYCE menu. But with the poor and slow service, I was falling asleep while I was eating.

1 skewer per order. The scallop is so little and the asparagus has seen better days but it's AYCE so, not a shocker. 4/5

Chicken Katsu Roll:
I was craving for some chicken katsu but they didn't have it on the menu - ordering this roll was my only hope of eating chicken katsu. It has imitation crab, chicken katsu, cucumber and avocado with eel sauce. 3/5

Salmon Killer:
Spicy salmon and cucumber inside, and salmon and jalapeno on top with ponzu, spicy mayo and hot sauce. It's not as spicy as it sounds. 4/5

Drum Roll:
Chopped deep-fried salmon crab mix and cucumber inside, and salmon on top with garlic ponzu sauce. 3.5/5

Sunrise Roll:
Spicy tuna inside, and salmon and green onion on top with ponzu sauce. 4/5

Salmon Nigiri:
The fish was pretty fresh and served at the right temperature. The cuts were decent. 3.5/5

This is definitely not one of Vegas' best sushi restaurants but if you're in the area and you're desperate then. this place will do. AYCE is $22 at lunch time (11:30am-4pm) and $27 at dinner time (4pm-10:30pm), half rolls available, items in red are not part of AYCE, and they charge for leftovers."}
{"text":"They advertise closed at 1 .. show up at 12:20 and they tell you they're closed. 40 minutes left to make some money and serve some food."}
{"text":"Have been eating here for awhile but felt compelled to leave a review based purely on the manager's handling of our last experience and his overall attitude. We ordered the all you can eat for two of us. As usual, we ordered the uni which I almost gagged because it smelled and tasted like shit. I told the server and didn't get a response. We ordered it again thinking it would be better. This time my wife gagged and spit it out. The aftertaste left in our mouths made this experience very unpleasant.I advised the manager and he responded that we were the only ones to complain and that nobody else complained and walked off. Total disregard for our unpleasant experience. No apology. Bad management."}
{"text":"Hands down our top AYCE sushi spot. Servers are very polite and helpful and provide great suggestions. This time we had Ontida as our server and she was the best! I asked her for her recommendations and she suggested a few of her favorites and one that was no longer on the menu, but went out of her way to ask the sushi chefs if they can still make it! Sushi is delicious and they even have ramen and Korean BBQ included in their AYCE menu."}
{"text":"I don't usually review a place after the first visit but it's difficult to imagine this isn't the norm for these folks. The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because the food is actually very good but not good enough to endure the lack luster service that you get for a price that doesn't match.

I would talk about what we ordered and how good it was but unfortunately for me the service made it very forgettable and in all honestly it's nothing you can't get anywhere else.

We were seated right away but ignored for about 15 min. That always seems to be the case when you're hungry. They were pretty busy but not too busy to at least past by the table and acknowledge us. Specially sense you took the next table's order who by the way were seated after we were. We're pretty understandable of situations when you're short staffed but you are in the food service and hospitality business. When we finally did get served we didn't get our water for about 8 min and they were never refilled for the duration of our visit. Though they were very quick to bring the check when we asked for it.

We are the type of people who tip regardless because you just never know the reason for the service, but our tip is commensurate with the service and needless to say it was not a very good tip."}
{"text":"Food was great. We did the all you can eat
Lunches and it gave us many ideas for next trip out there. So happy we tried it. Fresh fish very tasty and hope to make it back soon. 
It was great that we could order half rolls and share between us. Loved all the
Spicy type ones. Only one I didn't care
For was the tempura one with
Scallops. Needed a fork was too much on top! 
But still fresh and tasty"}
{"text":"The food was ok. The AYCE wasn't the best they have some rolls that sound really good by they are off the AYCE menu.  Additionally the rolls are over packed with rice and they not rolled properly they fall apart as soon as you pick them up.  My husband ordered a beer and it was warm, we had to wait like 30 minutes to get a table even though there was no one ahead of us."}
{"text":"I like the ayce you can have half rolls so you can try more things. The selection is very good. We came here because they have a kids menu which worked at well. We will be back"}
{"text":"I love Kaizen for their quality of the food. This is my go to AYCE sushi place in the entire valley!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite AYCE sushi restaurant. The manager and staff treat my family well every time we come here. Usually when we come, we're always in a table of 10+. The wait for the sushi and food is sometimes long but it's worth the wait. 

We start with the nigiri sashimi first, oysters, uni, toro, negotoro, and rolls last (only because that's the most filling) This is the only restaurant where I would eat oysters. No where else. Hamachi Kama is a must with a side of rice and garlic ahi tuna nigiri is my favorite. It has a nice ponzu taste.

I recommend getting a stamp card when visiting and it's always good to call for reservations."}
{"text":"I was recommended to this place by a friend. After the long wait, I was excited to try it until we realized it took 1 hour to receive our order. We only ordered 2 rolls and 6 piece sashimi. Seriously? The sushi chef forgot our order. We didn't get our rolls until he was reminded 40 min later. What kind of business model is this. It's not really all you can eat when you order a few items and they take that long to get it to you. I would avoid this place like the plague. So disappointed on how they handle service and food was ok. It seems like they do it on purpose so you can't order. The menu clearly states you only have an hour and half to order food. Hmmmm that just doesn't seem right. Does it?"}
{"text":"Excellent service from our server Adam. The food is always great and fast service. We always come here after a long day at work and it's always a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I saw that kaizen sushi had  good selection of rolls and appetizers. Some of the stuff was unlimited too. They also have a lit up board with some daily fish specials that's included in the all you can eat. The sushi chef was friendly and service from sushi counter was good. The service from waitress slash hostess was a bit slow in the beginning since she was doing dual roles. As the meal progressed so did the service to the good side.

Kaizen sushi is one of the smallest sushi bars in the local area I've been too but the sushi was on par or better than most. Some of the appetizers from the kitchen was a bit slow and took awhile even tho it was not that busy when I went there Sunday when they opened at 4pm.

Id definitely go back again when I'm in the green valley area. 

1. They so so half rolls

2. Fish to rice ration was not bad.

3. Tons of appetizer options, you can over do it and get full just on the different appetizers."}
{"text":"Love their AYCE 
Delicious Sushi at a reasonable price. A bit expensive if you order of the menu so definitely go for AYCE."}
{"text":"If any of you guys head over to kaizen the roll you must get is the ROCK N ROLL I have never tasted anything more fresh. Their staff is great always friendly, providing the best customer service."}
{"text":"Kaizen is my go to place for sushi!! I love sushi and I can eat it everyday, but this place takes 1st place in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"I love finding good sushi spots in Las Vegas. Especially up where I live. The sushi here is very good quality. My boyfriend goes for simple rolls like the garlic salmon & tuna rolls. He claims the freshness of the fish here is hard to beat. Since I'm not into raw fish, I go for tempura rolls. My favorite roll here is the Crazy Girl roll. I seriously crave for it all the time. Very fast & good customer service. We'll be back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Overall this place is OK. Not the best sushi but not the worst. I personally feel that the prices are average where lunch is 22.99 and dinner is 27 or 28 a person. They have many exclusions on the sushi list. Some of those exclusions are because of lunch price. But both lunch and dinner have many roll exclusions. The quality of the rolls are nice and the freshness of fish and veg are good. The waitresses that take orders don't exude personality and seem socially awkward. The menu is large and somewhat confusing to look through where other equal Sushi shops streamline the rolls in a more friendly front and back sheet."}
{"text":"I so badly want to give this place 4 or 5 stars...... but I just can't..... 

The price for AYCE is about average for this town so nothing really to report on that. The food choices are pretty decent!!! I have loved most everything I have eaten there. The things I didn't like, wasn't bc of the quality, it is just I don't like eel or lobster and it had one of them in it.... or maybe I ordered something a little too spicy for my taste buds..... so none of that is their fault! I am obsessed with these crispy things.... yummy yummy crispy spicy tuna things.... I don't remember what they are called exactly... but try them!!! 

The sushi chefs are amazing!! They are friendly, fast, funny!!!! Every time I go, I sit at the bar and they usually suggest a new roll for me to try and it's always fun!!! 

The reason I cannot give them a higher than 3 is because of the waiter that is always there and we seem to always get him. I cannot judge the other support staff... they seem amazing... mostly bc they pick up his slack. We come to this establishment probably once a month, sometimes more and this young Asian guy with glasses is always there (avoid his section). The tall one with glasses is good, the shorter one not so much. Had a Dairy Queen shirt on tonight. He is so slow.... takes forever to get your drink order and bc you order your sushi through him... you might as well order it all at the beginning and make sure he writes it down correctly.... he has messed our order up every time we have gone.... and that's if we even get all of our order. God forbid there is a big game on, no matter what the sport is..... well don't depend on him and get someone else bc he will ignore you when you talk and be watching TV or stand in the corner staring at the game and only work during commercial break or half time. 

This being sad I DO recommend this place bc it is really good AYCE sushi..... just try to avoid that homie!!"}
{"text":"Great service and outstanding tempura scallop roll paired with some Miso soup and a large, fresh salad.  All for under $20. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here to fulfill my sushi craving but when I went recently I noticed that it went slightly downhill.
The service was still excellent but the food was a bit disappointing. A lot of the appetizers I ordered were not even available. We went to eat an early dinner around 4:30pm, so how could they run out of so many things already? I wasn't really that bothered since I go for the sushi anyways, but then I hit another wall. I usually go for their delish screaming O salad but it didn't even seem like screaming O salad at all. Also, not all, but some of the nigiri did not look or taste very fresh.
I'm still skeptical about going again but I might give it one more chance considering how much I loved it before."}
{"text":"Horrible!!! 
Went there during the day and ordered 2 rolls. 
Halfway through eating I noticed the chef who prepared my food was sweating and wiping his forehead with his hand then without washing them he continued to make the food. Didn't think twice about it until later that night I ended up with the WORST food poisoning I've ever had. 
Sick for 2 days. 
Never again. 
Stay away."}
{"text":"Zero star's.  My family and I went in today for lunch,  it was my husband and 3 daughters, and I.  My oldest is 5 and my twins are 3. My husband and I were debating if we were going to do the AYCE,  in the meantime we tried to order 2 orders of Edamame,  but our waitress,  the manager (Jessica) said that we she needed to know if were doing the AYCE or not, because if she put the order in now they would charge us for the Edamame, and not cover it in the AYCE. We decided to do the AYCE,  we ordered our girls a kid meal each with fruit punch.  Our sushi came out before our daughters food, and my 5 year old told me that she was so hungry,  so as I mother of course I gave her a piece of my Alaska roll (which was dry) and made with just a chunk of fake crab meat. When the waitress noticed that I gave my daughter one piece of sushi she freaked out on us, making us feel like criminals.  It's not like we didn't order our daughters their own meals. Okay so when the Edamame finally came out, after I asked twice,  and after we finished our sushi btw. My 3 daughters were eating one of the orders since we ordered 2. Again we got yelled out, it was so embarrassing,  we told the manager that we wanted it for our daughters if the garlic one was spicy before we even placed the order,  Why didn't she mentioned that we would need to order an ala cart one, it was only $5.00 so come on, really? The whole meal they kept starting at us to make sure we weren't Sharing with our kids, again the girls had their own meals. The staring became very uncomfortable. Never going back. The sushi was dry and way too much sauce.  Not fresh at all, and the service was horrible.  At least the restroom was clean, after I finished my second roll, I got sick and couldn't hold it down."}
{"text":"Great place with a variety of rolls but horrible service at times. I feel like it's a hit and miss."}
{"text":"We used to like coming here but recently we've had to start tipping the bussers instead of the waiter who seems to be there every time we go. He's nice enough but not good at checking on his tables, and gets table orders mixed up. Today, he took our order when we sat, and then never stoped at our table again. The bussers took our plates and filled our waters while we waiting to place our next order. Eventually we got up and left, still hungry and disappointed. We now go to Sushi Wa. Better food and better service!"}
{"text":"Meh , I had better sushi. Try to avoid going there during rush hour. We were doing fine until people started to show up. Literally waiting for like 10 mins to place the order for our sushi. Seems like the waiters just too busy or completely ignored us."}
{"text":"No stars, they were rude. I had guests from out of town come in I'm home why and the only place to eat where I've eaten before many ,many , many times was here and we got there 30 minutes before they were supposed to close and then actually let us dine in and long story short to put it in a nutshell, it was 5 of us including 1 child and they still turn the lights off while were eating 10 minutes into getting our food which was only 5 minutes from the moment they said is down in the rush this to get out and until they turned off the lights on us very rude I can't believe this ever happened that she's they know me there and I've been there many times with my lady, but hey, I guess that's how goes when you want to get out of work early and go party, nevermind money and your regular patrons right. !?! Not cool."}
{"text":"Still my favorite AYCE after I reviewed them the first time a year and a half ago. I've managed to cash in one stamp card during this time and have one more stamp to go before I cash in another. Convenience and VIP service keep us coming back.

Probably 90% of the trips we've made to Kaizen have been on Monday nights after we've watched the football game over at B Dubs. Making the hundred foot walk to stuff ourselves and have BOGO sakes for $27 is an easy one. I can imagine what the sushi chefs are thinking when they see four of us come strolling over around 9 PM.

Wei has been our server and he knows pretty much what we want every time. There's no wait to place our next order because he knows to take it as soon as the food is dropped off. We've had no problems with the sushi and the selection of hot and cold tapas is pretty ridiculous. You're limited to one order of pork belly, but it's completely understandable because we'd have 5 orders a piece of the best item if we could.

When I bring the non sushi eating family, the boxes and rice bowls are plenty sufficient for them. It does get busy and on a wait during dinner, but we've yet to experience one when we go around 9. This has been my top pick for a while and I really don't see it changing any time soon."}
{"text":"Sushi was ok. But customer service was awesome. Went for lunch about an hour and  half before an appointment. We placed orders for our food early on but everything was slow to come to the table due to just one chef on staff that day. Our appointment time was coming closer so had to cancel the orders. The staff was understanding and gave us 1/2 off our ayce. Will come back again to give the rest of the menu a try."}
{"text":"So since moving to the area, I have been wanting to try this place out. Today, I decided I needed to get my sushi fix. High level, I was very impressed with my experience, here is my take on my first trip to Kaizen.

Since it was my first time, I tired the all you can eat option which allowed me to have a lot of choices. I tried a baked roll and a shrimp tempura roll and also got a chicken rice bowl with veggies since my wife was able to join me

Food - I give them an A, the rolls were awesome and tasted great. The shrimp tempura roll was the thickest I've ever seen!!! The ingredients tasted fresh and combined with the sauces were reallly good.

Service - we were greeted upon entering the restaurant and were given the option of eating at the sushi bar or at the table, decided to eat at the bar. Everyone was really nice and attentive and checked on me to ensure I was happy with the food. 

The restaurant itself was really nice and has a outdoor eating area with lighting at night time. I felt the restaurant had a pretty modern design, the staff appear to do a good job keeping the dining area clean. 

All in all,I enjoyed my experience and the food here and will return. Next time need to go at dinner time since there is a price difference, wondering if there are different items available."}
{"text":"We went to eat there last night. We called ahead of time to ask to reserve a table (we had a party of 9). They said that they had a table for us. Not even a 5 minute ride we get there and they told us the wait was 30 minutes and that they didn't save the table. We finally get our table and the service was soooooo slow. We had to flag down a waiter just to get our drink orders after sitting there for 20 minutes. We did all you can eat, which the food was so delicious. We had to flag a waiter every time we need something then remind them 20 minutes later.  The whole dinner process was about two hours just because the service was slow. The food though, was delicious and I will probably just order take out next time instead of waiting, what seemed like forever, for our next plate to come out."}
{"text":"We had the AYCE Sushi here the other night and I truly enjoyed it!
Typically I hate AYCE sushi as it usually results in a belly ache.

The previous AYCE sushi places I have dined at have used mediocre fish quality and gigantic rice balls.  What I like about Kaizen was the fish was fresh, nice quality and that the rice was a great size for sushi.  Keep in mind that high end fish such as oh-toro you are only allowed one order and that the one order is consistent of only 1 piece.  It would be nice if that was noted on the menu.  However, that is really the worst I can say.

We ordered a ton...  garlic edamame (spice but very tasty), Hamachi Sashimi with the Jalapeno's was delicious, various nigiri sushi was great, Hawaiian roll and the baked Scallop Volcano role were both very good!

I currently live on the other side of town but I would totally make the drive to come back and have AYCE sushi at Kaizen!  

The food here is amazing the only reason I didn't give the 5th star was due to the wait staff.  A few were nice and a few could stand to be a bit more friendly."}
{"text":"This place is as good as is gets in North Las Vegas.  I wanted something that was light and fresh, and nothing that the typical bar food places had to offer.

Kaizen delivered.  Delicious, affordable, awesome atmosphere and friendly service.  Talk to Paul (he is awesome) or Michele (super friendly).

Bottom line: go there!"}
{"text":"There's a huge variety of rolls, appetizers and dessert but I usually order nigiri when I get Ayce and Kaizen's nigiri didn't impress me. The rice to fish ratio is off, there's way more rice than fish. It's nice that they offer yellowtail belly and toro but I don't see myself coming back here."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and ordered the bento box with salmon teriyaki. The salmon was really dry and I didn't like the dressing that was on the salad. It came with white rice and that was dry too. Was expecting this place to be better, oh well..."}
{"text":"I've been going to Kaizen for a couple of years now on and off, and the food is amazing, but during a recent experience the service was not great. 

I went in for my birthday just the other day with my mom, being her first time experiencing the restaurant, and my two year old daughter. 
It took a while to be sat and while the hostess was seating us, she didn't bother to ask if we needed a high chair or booster seat, so I had asked for a highchair. Usually if it's busy I dismiss it and find a highchair myself, but it was not. The hostess walked away and I assumed she would get one as I was standing, holding my daughter in the meantime. I walked towards the stack of high chairs after a couple of minutes waiting to receive one and I sensed an attitude while she raced me there. 

That didn't bother me at the time so we sat down and read the menu as we waited to be greeted. About 10 minutes go by and my daughter started getting restless, my mom and I decide to wait a little more since we were set and ready to order. After 20 minutes of being at the table without a server or being greeted we decided to leave and it left me a little disappointed being that I consider myself a loyal customer and I only wanted to have a nice birthday dinner with my family. 

That being said, my mom was not impressed her first time at Kaizen and probably our last time visiting."}
{"text":"So this is an updated review. My husband, kids, and I went yesterday at around 3-4p and there was literally 3 other tables there. The food was painstakingly slow... we got baked rolls before we got sashimi. The sashimi didn't taste fresh either. My husband and I used to love this place, but that was seriously the last time. One of our kids ordered chicken teriyaki, he said it wasn't as good as usual. And we looked at it, they must be using popcorn chicken now instead of breasts. It took about 30 min to come out and we ordered it as soon as we sat down. Sorry, kaizen, we used to come every week...we're looking for a new AYCE spot."}
{"text":"I will not lie...my yelp love can be bought! This place is probably a 3.5 star restaurant, but I'll round up given the fact that the sushi chef gave us a complimentary poke salad =) Gotta love the freebies!  

There are disclaimers to this review...North Las Vegas is not foodie heaven...in fact restaurants close early and there are limited options.  With that said, this place is pretty legit for rolls and the fish is decent.  They have a big sign outside that says 50% off sushi...which is slightly misleading since their happy hour rolls are 15% off....

The rolls are typical of pretty much every average sushi restaurant, but the service was attentive and free food always wins me over.  The tempura cheesecake seemed like a creative dessert, but slightly lack luster.... I'll probably be back given the close location to my home and they are open later than many of the other sushi places in North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My favorite place for sushi. Their prices are great for what you get and the ambiance is dark and modern. I recommend the caterpillar and dragon roll. They never disappoint!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place 3.5 stars since it's pretty expensive and I was only impressed by 1 dish of many that we ordered. If you like avocado, order the Avocado Train Roll...it's pretty awesome and has a ton of avocado and a side of crab/avocado that's pretty tasty."}
{"text":"It took me awhile to finally type up a review. 6 visits later, I finally decided I will give Kaizen just 3 stars.

Why? They don't seem to be consistent. The first time we came, we AYCE'D it. But...not opting for the all you can eat would be retarded, so whenever we come...we always opt for it. The price for an AYCE is about the same wherever you go. About 22 bucks for lunch, and 24-25 for dinner? I forgot-writer's block. 

Anyway, I was an addict for their yummy yummy tuna. Basically, it's pieces of tuna mixed in some mayo sweet sauce concoction, sitting atop a crispy and sweet tasting wonton wrapper. I order this like a nutball. However, the last couple times we have gone it tasted like a complete disappointment. Must I explain what a complete disappointment taste like? Because I'm sure we have all had it. The tuna mix seemed a bit watery and a pretty scampy in serving in comparison to the other times. 

On some visits my spicy tuna roll looked like a complete mess. As in, someone's knife needed to be sharpened and/or.someone is in training mode as far as putting a roll together. Their honey toast dessert...the toast was burnt. And honestly, if it weren't a part of the ayce, I would no way in hell spend the 4-5 bucks on it. It's literally like 1 hawaiian sweet roll, toasted...or burnt depending who is doing the toasting...or burning and a small scoop of ice cream atop. 

The waitresses, I can't say they're lousy, but I also can't say they're awesome! They're there to do a job, and they did it. Sometimes they're in the mood and sometimes they arent. People, when you work...your attitude always shows regardless. But...I am one of those customers who doesn't care about a waiter/waitress mood. As long as they take our order, give our order, not catch a case with me because of their personal issues, do their job timely and efficiebtly, I'm good. 

The quality of their fish doesn't always taste its best. Husband usually orders uni, if they even have uni, and a few of the times the uni did not look fresh. Kind of like it had been sitting out without a cover. 

Overall, to have an all you can eat in the vicinity, it isn't a bad option. The only reason why we come here is simply because of its location, and that it is a good size restaurant that can perfectly accomodate my gang of 6. I can bring my stroller in with no inconvenience to myself or the other patrons. I do love its ambiance/decor as well. 

Won't say I HIGHLY recommend them, but if you have a large party with you, looking for something nearby, go for it. A sushi spot that wont wow the hell out of you with the freshest of freshest, but hoping you have a good experience, it will definitely fulfill the sushi spot for the gut. P.S. The ayce does not come with any beer or sake. 

Definitely kid and stroller friendly!"}
{"text":"I'm giving them two stars. The sushi was great, big and flavorful. 
I'm giving them two stars because the service was absolutely horrendous! It took 45 minutes to get seated, which. Okay. It was super busy at first and a Friday night. That's understandable. We got sat down at the bar and checked out the menu, we ordered 2 sakes and each told the chef a roll. The sushi only took a few minutes, but they didn't give us any water or any utensils to use. Not a single person checked on is, It took 20 minutes to get our drinks and utensils and that was after a second person was stopped to ask about it. 
Then. After almost finishing my second roll, ready to order another, the chef just leaves. Just. .. bye. For 15 minutes. Are you kidding me? I was beyond annoyed. THEN. when they brought the check, the server had the audacity to tell us that after a $100 check, that since it was our first time here, they won't charge for the \"leftovers\" which was 3 pieces. Which, I'm from Reno where all you can eat sushi is everywhere and I have never once been threatened with a charge for a few bites left over. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Rolls are so good!! Best location yet. Fresh and tasted great. Ordered garlic edamame, not a fan. Dry with not much to it. 
Other than that, will come back. Really happening place at 10:30pm on a Friday!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I have been coming here for years. The sushi is always fresh and yummy. Kaizen is hands down the best sushi I have had in las vegas and california."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Great value!  You will enjoy the service and atmosphere!    Make sure you try the Sean Roll or the Mountain Roll both are absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now. Food is always great, service has been good every time. Price isn't bad at all for all you can eat and they've got punchcards that get you a free all you can eat every once in a while. Tons of fried rolls which are awesome. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Just stopped in after a late class. Second time here. Great service to start and a clean casual environment.  Server said if ordering more than 2 rolls that All-you-can eat is the best deal. Probably gonna go A.Y.C.E every time for the value. Also, I'm pretty sure they give you a free drink for writing a Yelp review"}
{"text":"If you are amongst the vegan crew, chef Alex will create something savvy and new for you!!  His ideas extend far beyond the simplicity of avocado and cucumber (although still a personal favorite!)  Using rice paper, seaweeds, fresh veggies, tempura, and more he will certainly go above and beyond for  your vegan palate!  (Not to worry, Kaizen has plenty to offer to you fishitarians as well!)"}
{"text":"The service was really good, we went with a party of 10 people and they did a great job at keeping the AYCE sushi coming. There is a large variety of sushi and the tempura ice cream is also yummy!"}
{"text":"First of all the buffet is so worth it! I get a whole lot for the price of the buffet! Fatty tuna, got it! Pork belly, got it! Salmon nigiri, got it! Rib eye, got it! Monkey brains, got it!

I probably ate $100 worth of premium cut, delicious fish! I was glad this was recommended! It was so delicious and nutritious!


Buffet was on point! Servers were on point! The fish was definitely on point!"}
{"text":"Kaizen is sometimes good and sometimes bad.  It hasn't been bad enough for us to stop going (we probably go at least once every few months or when we want to do do all you can eat) but they are very inconsistent.

The staff sometimes is very attentive and prompt, other times they forget about you and leave you waiting for long periods of time.  The sushi chefs are always different and depending on who makes your roll, you will get a different result.  For example, my husband always orders nigiri - sometimes it'll come out drizzled with soy sauce and have wasabi in between the rice and fish, other times it's just the fish (which is what he is used to).  Sometimes I get Japanese lasagna and it's delicious other times it comes out soggy and missing the crips on top.  The other notable item I enjoy is the monkey brains - sometimes it's a giant avocado half with tuna stuffed in it other times it's a bite sized fried ball of minced tuna no avocado.  The poke, sometimes it's a bowl full of fish with a little seaweed other times it's seaweed with three pieces of poke in the bowl.

With that said we do enjoy coming here but it's because there aren't a lot of AYCE sushi options on our side of town.  Overall I would recommend this place if you live in the area and are craving sushi but I wouldn't say it's worth passing up any other AYCE spot to get to. 

Our favorite sushi place is \"Sushi Twister\" on Boulder highway and tropicana.  That restaurant is one that if we have the time we will drive 45 minutes or so for it and endure the long waits.

For Kaizen it's a place we go when we are hungry now for sushi and don't want to have to wait in line, they aren't ever too busy to seat you and for me it is located less than 5 minutes away."}
{"text":"The best ayce in the valley. Fresh fish with many options for the non sushi fans. And honey toast for desert ends the night perfectly. Excellent!"}
{"text":"This is 3 stars as in it was just OK.

I stopped by on a Friday night at 5:30 and it was empty??? one other table and that was it.

I sat at the sushi bar and decided to go for the AYCE.  I did enjoy a chef's special handroll.  I din't really care for the selection of rolls and the sushi on the AYCE menu.    They had a small choice of mostly cooked shrimp, crab rolls or it had salmon on it.  Other than the hand roll - I really didn't like anything else on the menu.  As far as sushi goes this sushi is basically intended for easy to please round eyes.

This place is amiss when it comes to the \"experience\" of a sushi restaurant.  I almost felt unwelcome there.  Restaurateurs need to realize that dining is more than food to eat it is an experience.  

It wasn't bad food or even bad service - everything was just ok.  I got the feeling that my business there was not appreciated.  

Overall, a banal experience but it wasn't that they did anything bad it was just..."}
{"text":"Third and last time coming to this place. I keep giving these guys the benefit of the doubt, maybe they're short staffed or what not. However three separate occasions at different hours of the day they have managed to come short of expectations. At this point I had to walk out of the place. I walk into what seemed like a busy waiting area, which is no problem. So I ended up going to the bar, where it took at least 20 mins just to get a glass of water or even acknowledged that I was even there. The sushi chef at the bar asked the other two patron to the side of they needed anything after he managed to work on someone's order the entire time I was sitting there, and when he finally looked up to ask the others he remained to ignore that I was sitting in front of him and kept going about his business. Terrible service. If it wasn't for their subpar sushi and their distance from my community, I would have never come back after the first time."}
{"text":"First timer here at Kaizen, the area is in a quiet residential area. I'm from L.A. And so change in atmosphere is sometimes necessary for me to enjoy places I eat. My friend recommended me to this place instead of going to the strip and have to wait in line for a seat. Overall the service is good, my friend spilled liquids twice and staff here had no problems cleaning up his mess. Very friendly and the food quality is not bad at all. I'm not picky eater, but I do expect the basic necessities when eating out.  Service \"check\", food \"check\" cleanliness \"check\" . Will come back again."}
{"text":"We went to dinner tonight, we are trying to find a closer sushi spot near our side of town. Unfortunately we were let down. Tonight is Thursday, Kaizen was pretty steady and all tables were full plus a few waiting throughout the night. Well with all that said.... there was only one server taking orders! Yes, one. Poor boy, I felt bad he was alone. There was another girl walking around setting up tables I guess but that's all she was doing. Su chefs were standing around, not sure how that's possible with a restaurant full of people. There was no hustle to get things taken care of. The rolls were interesting, I wouldn't say any in particular that I remember to say, yea try that one! I'll say that we won't be going back and we failed again to find a sushi spot near our side of town. Back to china town we go!"}
{"text":"THIS IS MY FAVORITE LOCATION. Everything about the sushi here is so fresh and delicious , all the the way down to the rice!! Tonight we got ayce and we got all half rolls of ; 

Nevada 
Sex bomb 
Kai
Monster 
Snow White 
!!!!
Every single roll was absolutely phenomenal . Will definitely be coming back to this location again! 

Also got several orders of the Super white tuna Nigiri , so delicious! 

5/5 stars all around !"}
{"text":"Yeah really, really, really terrible. Nigiri was so bad. Fish not fresh, so much rice you can't even taste the old fish. The sad part is the rice is also really bad. Do not come here."}
{"text":"Kaizen rocks!!!!!
Overall THE BEST All you can eat in Henderson / Las Vegas !!!!
Truly good variety and fresh salmon, oysters , and Uni"}
{"text":"The sushi is great but the service sucks. Seriously sat down, almost 10 min later a server comes to greet us, then about 10 min after that another server came to greet us as if we just sat down bc it was his section and he had been MIA. And our sushi took about 20 min to get to our table after ordering and the restaurant wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"Service here is absolutely terrible. Forget to put in two of my orders. Rarely came to check on us for refills. They sat in the back and disappeared. One girl couldn't stay off of her phone in the back instead of helping customers. Best part, it was dead with two other people inside...."}
{"text":"This was a very nice restaurant with a great ambiance. The food delicious, the fried rice was the best fried rice I've ever had. The service was relatively quick and the staff was friendly. I will definitely be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"What happened to this place? I used to live by this place and it was always a great sushi and bento spot. That has really changed over the years. 

I think with all of the AYCE spot in LV, Kaizen must have felt left out. Now they have AYCE and it seems the menu items have suffered because of it. The sushi is still decent, but taking non-sushi eaters like our nieces and nephews is not an option. The Chicken Katsu was sooooo sad. It was like a super flat, dry piece of chicken that was hardly breaded and were cut into 1/4\" strips. It was worse than chicken straws at Burger King. 

The chicken teriyaki was more like a sweet stir fry. The rice was hard and the salad was completely soaked with dressing. My wife likes her dressing, but this was overkill. 

The service was pretty sporty as well. Our waitress took our order, but she didn't seem to know the menu. She insisted they didn't have chicken udon, but we showed her the menu and she said she was mistaken. Ummmm... Ya..... Our food came out at all different times and it just didn't seem as organized. 

I think overall it was a pretty bad experience. I think they are so focused on making AYCE work, that everything else is suffering. I hope they rethink that business practice. Not everyone goes AYCE."}
{"text":"Authenticity: not authentic. Korean run. I normally would not come to an AYCE place, but my hubby insisted we try something new and this was close by and we were pressed for time. 

Food: AYCE. We tried a variety of nigiri (tuna, unagi, salmon, seated albacore, garlic tuna) and a shrimp tempura roll. The rice was all wrong. Too much vinegar and compressed so tightly. Visually the fish quality was low. The shrimp tempura was cold in the roll so not sure when they fried it (yesterday?)

Service: slow. Not one waiter is dedicated to a particular table so it's hap-hazard. We ordered strawberry mochi for dessert and it took them 15 minutes and two times asking to finally tell us that they were too frozen to serve. 

Won't be back obviously!!"}
{"text":"Super nice, great service. My go to sushi spot on the north side. They always make sure I have all the sauces I want."}
{"text":"The all you can eat menu has changed and has plenty of more options. They also have added sashimi to their menu and other special rolls such as York and yellowtail belly. The price is normal for AYCE but I love this menu more than most other AYCE menu"}
{"text":"Kaizen rocks.

The decor is cool and the place is intimate.  They play a little acid jazz along with house and garage.  The ambiance is cool.  The staff is really good.

While the Kaizen appears to have few customers, it could be my new go-to place.

The sushi was awesome.  Toro and tako were fantastic.  The fish was as fresh and tender as any I've had in Vegas.  The rolls were imaginitive and tasty.

We landed on a great night, as it was two for one drinks night.

I highly recommend Kaizen."}
{"text":"Just decent AYCE place.not too good,not too bad.Service wasn't bad,wasn't too good.But AC was too much when I was here.felt like I need to leave asap or need jacket!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and always had a good experience but last night was not very good. We didn't get greeted at our table and had to call someone over to take our order. 

The sushi was lacking freshness. The uni was just awful, it had a stench taste and I was really looking forward to trying some good uni and that just completely ruined it for me. The fish to rice ratio on the nigiri was not portioned evenly. There was just way too much rice.

The sashimi selection included in the AYCE was delicious and the appetizers were pretty good too. Dessert was yummy as usual."}
{"text":"Sports Bar meets Sushi with pop music videos on large projection screen creates a unexpected atmosphere. If you are looking for a place to drink Budweiser with your 'all you can eat' sushi...this is the spot for you. I was not impressed. I found the service slow and uninviting. We sat at the bar, none of the chefs interacted with us, which I found particular strange being one of three couples in the entire restaurant. When I asked to order one of their specialty rolls, the chef turned to the hostess and said 'they want to order'. Apparently there is a chain of command in the order placement system at 'KAIZEN FUSION ROLL & SUSHI'. I would suggest a sign or explanation for future guests to prevent these or other etiquette blunders. Food was compellingly average."}
{"text":"Delicious rolls, very friendly service!!! We had all you can eat lunch rolls, and it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"All you can eat for sure.  It was nice to order the half rolls and have such a variety.  I did not like the tastes like ice cream with fruit/rice combo."}
{"text":"Great selection for all you can eat. Asahi on draft is always a plus in my book. Nice and comfortable ambiance. The service was great and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Kaizen Sushi is the first decent sushi restaurant that I have been too since moving to Las Vegas in 2015. The All You Can Eat is a little pricey, I recommend going during dinner hours because they have more menu options. The service is hit or miss depending on how busy the restaurant is. The location is real easy to get to as well. I will definitely be going back to Kaizen."}
{"text":"The AYCE menu is fantastic! Huge variety of sushi, hot dishes, cold dishes, appetizers, & desert! Every roll we ordered was delicious and each had a very good flavor combo! 

Tip: Be prepared to wait for a table on the weekends! It's worth it!"}
{"text":"On a mission to find another all you can eat sushi spot besides our usual place Oyshi, we found this delightful place in Henderson (from Yelp of course). Firstly, the service was really good! Everyone was so welcoming from beginning to end. The kind asian guy with glasses and tattoos and the sweet gal with rockin' red hair. The ambiance is pleasant not overwhelming and just overall a nice place to enjoy good sushi and other delectable appetizers. Don't forget the beverages either! They have wine and a nice little bar. We like their selection alot, I got Japanese Lasagna rolls and this amazing Sex Bomb one. Also Ribeye steak and delicious cheesecake and ice cream. If you like spicy they have this yummy sauce called Ass Sauce and Yum Yum rolls too! My husband and I look forward to our next sushi experience here next time we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Kaizen always has prompt and friendly service and amazing food! There are at least 10 rolls on their menu that I love, and I'm pretty picky with which fish I will and won't eat. Their All-You-Can-Eat is a really good deal considering that it includes appetizers, specialty rolls, sashimi, dessert, and anything else that would ever be on a Japanese menu. Lunch prices for AYCE go until 4, and they also do it on weekends. Kaizen is my absolute favorite place to eat in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Thus one of my favorite sushi place North of Las Vegas. They a variety to things to pick from. Good service. Ive been twice and definitely be back."}
{"text":"Although there food is amazing, the service is not good. They are kinds and helpful WHEN they get to you. It isn't that they ignore you but more that they are under-staffed.  I've been here more than 10 times and lately it seems like they can't handle the amount of business that comes in. I really hope that they hire more help soon."}
{"text":"I have lived nearby for 3 months.  I walk by on my way to the park several times a week and drive past here twice a day on my way to work.  The back door fronts a main street through Aliante,  Deer Springs Road.  The view from the street is filthy, broken chairs propped on buckets and the ground is covered in cigarettes and trash.  I wish this place would have more respect for the neighborhood and clean up the area facing the street."}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed the Bento Box I ordered. The Korean Shortribs Shrimp and Vegetable tempura was delicious ! The Vanilla Ice was amazing ! This is my  second visit to this establishment."}
{"text":"Yum!   This might be my new favorite ayce sushi spot.   

I've actually heard about it before but never went because I tend to be quite loyal to my favorite spot.   Well, I should have been coming here way earlier. 

The selection is vast and there are a lot of different cold and hot appetizers. 

The sushi menu is broken up by that type of roll (tempura, fried, etc.) and I like this because it helps me skip ones I know I wouldn't want (like fried rolls.)

There's a limit on the amount for a lot of the items so this kind of sucks but hey its great for when the people you are with don't like items you do (yellowtail belly!)

The service we received was pretty good.   The food came out fast.  Everything tasted really good even though it was fast and I really appreciate that."}
{"text":"Love the service. And fresh sushi, the environment is very hip.  Hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"I had the garden salad with gi get dressing and it was wonderful. The mixed greens were super fresh and I wanted to lick the dressing out of the bottom of the empty bowl! I also had the unagi which was fresh with a yummy buttery texture. The last thing I ate was the Lemon Roll and it was very fresh too. We ran in at 10:15 at night,  our waitress was great even though we were there right at closing."}
{"text":"Went their with the wife and some friends.  My friend and I had the ayce and noticed that their price went up to almost $28!  The fish is pretty thinly cut with quite a bit of rice which was a bit disappointing. The fish is fresh and tasty, staff were friendly, and very attentive.  Just can't get over the paper thin cut fish..."}
{"text":"Stopped for a very fast lunch and they were very helpful In accomplishing that goal.   Huge menu.  Just had to jump to decide.  The O roll was very good.  Would like to try others."}
{"text":"This is my favorite AYCE sushi place. It's close, and my favorite are the salmon and unagi nigiri with a lot of appetizers. All though the wait was longer than usual, to me worth the wait. Especially our server Gee. A lot of enthusiasm even with the busy period."}
{"text":"Wow is the serving staff on it here! So extremely attentive its amazing. So first and foremost the all you can eat (AYCE if you're cool) is the best value by far. Just do it. A huge variety of rolls to choose from and everything tastes great. The Asian tapas menu keeps things lively too."}
{"text":"I live not too far from them so I like to call and order my food ahead of time for pick up. They never seem to answer their phone. Last week I went and ordered food to go and the hostess just let the phone ring as they were standing right next to it. A bit frustrating."}
{"text":"Went here for date night... Was seated right away on a Friday night, and was asked for our order before even sat... Felt a little rushed by the server... Ordered the house wine because it was buy one get one free... So thought why not. Was a little disappointed with how the sushi menu looked because normally it would have pictures of what the sushi would look like this menu didn't. Ordered the shrimp tempura the Las Vegas roll and the what the Mexican fiesta roll.. Everything was just ok the waiter didn't seem to have much knowledge about the menu. Will probably not come back."}
{"text":"The sushi I had here was really good and huge as heck wowwww it was so crunchy and guuuuddd I suggested trying the ramen here also it's but chopsticks are something I'm still getting used to haha."}
{"text":"I Love this place dinner time sushi all you can eat is the BEST my husband and I just love it here for a few reasons one is they always bring you drinks when they see you run out not to mention the sushi is to die for !! Sexy girl was good   !! Been to alot of Sushi places like Sushi bay ext and trust this sushi place is by far the best lots of options, great customer service, great atmosphere not a small place which is really nice good music and all around great place to eat sushi they also have none sushi items on the all you can eat sushi menu."}
{"text":"Walked in around 30 minutes to closing, & we felt like we were the first customers greeted when Kaizen first opens in the day. I enjoyed the service & how upbeat they were even before the time they were closing. Hipster atmosphere, with televisions playing popular mainstream music videos. I'm always a fan of a restaurant having a theme to the environment, & Kaizen was very tastefully decorated. 

I stuck with the simple spicy tuna roll & my girlfriends ordered some creative, unique rolls (all to which I unfortunately forgot their names, but not the taste!) Most of their dishes are garnished with bold flavors, sauces, & seasonings to give it a kick, so if you're a fan of adding a little taste to your sushi, Kaizen will probably work out for you wonderfully! 

Prices are at what a decent sushi restaurant should be at, & would definitely recommend this location to anyone taking the spouse on a date or looking to go on a classy sushi lunch/dinner with their friends!"}
{"text":"I usually frequent this place once maybe twice a month.. The foods always good (keep in mind I go for the sushi) but service can be a hit or a miss and lately it's been a miss the waitresses have seemed rude rushing us and inattentive... I usually go when it's pretty slow and depending on my waitress it can be a fight to get them to do a half roll on one of my rolls and if it's busy I don't ask but when there is only one other small group in the restaurant I mean come on. They have a great lunch special !

As for me I keep going hoping the service improves..."}
{"text":"Dined in this time and it was great. They have lots of drink specials (by-one-get-one) on various things. I got a hot sake for $5 and got a free second. There were an ample number of servers so the service was good. There were 2-3 sushi chefs behind the bar at any given time so the sushi came out fast. But it wasn't too busy on a Saturday night at 7 PM...about 4 groups total. 

We dined on a Hurricane Roll (spicy tuna and fried salmon on top) and a Avocado Train roll. The Avocado Train roll is awesome but I think it can get monotonous if you order one just for yourself...probably best to share in a group. The rolls are a little on the pricey side so if you're personally going to order more than one roll you  may want to go for the all-you-can-eat option at $26.95."}
{"text":"This I my main sushi spot!! Just don't go on Friday or Saturday evening, it gets way too crowed and you kinda miss out on the great service. During the week it's spot on! Anything you order is da bomb!"}
{"text":"Not our favorite. Have come here a total of 2 times out of convenience. The rolls are nothing special. The fish is okay. Not good not bad. The sushi chefs do their job. Not the fun hangout type of place where you chat with your sushi chef though.
I doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"We are regulars- we love it! They make great sushi and the staff is awesome. The game is always on the tv - as is some weird Asian music videos (highly entertaining). Take a look at the special board- that's where it's at!"}
{"text":"I had the best sushi I've had in a long time. I must add I opted for the AYCE and the server gave me excellent service. GO GET SOME!"}
{"text":"Took forever to take my order!! Great food but need better customer service HORRIBLE!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great selection, amazing food and the best customer service in Henderson! SAE always takes care of us. Shout out to her."}
{"text":"We came in on a Wednesday and did the AYCE option everything was really good that we had. They also had a large range of items that were included in the AYCE menu. I would definitely recommend this place to others that haven't tried it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place! I love how they have half roll options so I can try multiple rolls without getting too stuffed. All the food is so good! The people who work here are super friendly and recognize me and my boyfriend when we walk in. They are my go to sushi place!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to review this restaurant for a while but haven't been able to. The year before last I would frequent this restaurant on a weekly basis but, since my work place moved locations I stopped visiting. I always received great service especially by the chefs who were very accommodating in the very ingredient specific orders I would make. The food was always good but, more recently when I came in I noticed the roll I ordered lacked the flavor from previous visits. There were not as many customers as I saw in previous visits (only two couples) but, maybe it was a slow night. I often evaluate a restaurants appeal by the number of customers in there and I was a little worried about this one. Also, the music seemed to be very loud and I couldn't relay my order to the waitress during the first attempt. I will return soon and hopefully it'll be more lively in visits to come. I really like the staff and certain menu items. Overall it was and (fingers crossed) still is a good restaurant."}
{"text":"Very very disappointed about the customer service. Thursday night with full house they only hAve one server and he told us just the waiting is like 30-40 mints until the first order, turned his back and left like he didn't even care. They don't have any manners and they don't even care about customers. Very bad management. If you want to go there and be treated like shit just try it."}
{"text":"This isn't too far from my office, so I come here often for the AYCE lunch. They have an excellent selection of sushi, and the food always tastes great. I've never had a problem with the fish not being fresh before. Are there better places? Sure, but not many that are AYCE."}
{"text":"??????????2????????5???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????(^ ^)???????????27?????"}
{"text":"Always excellent customer service, very friendly atmosphere! The food is amazing, our go to when we crave sushi! The all you can eat is a must if you are hungry and want to save a little money. Definitely a place I recommend to all our friends and family!"}
{"text":"The place is a good AYCE sushi spot. Clean. Decent noise level. The kitchen service for appetizers was a little slower than I'm used too. The chefs made the rolls quick and delicious. It's my second time here and I'd come back for sure. The place had an A, I didn't know what the guy saw when he wrote his review just 21 hours ago. He's blind."}
{"text":"Basic sushi. Ive tasted better from the grocery store."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time, that's what this place is. We have been here three times and it's always the same. Very poor service, we figured it was because they were busy but came back on a slow day, still the same, the lack of customer service is a joke. We will never return, if you want a great sushi place this is not it, we have been going to kazuki lately and it is a much better atmosphere and much better service. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! It's a decent size, has pretty good service (we went one time and the guy ignored us the whole time)  but every other time was on point. Sushi is fresh and delicious with a good variety to choose from. We usually go to Sushi Mon but have made this our go to place. It's gets pretty pack and can take a while to be seated but is worth the wait to us. Hope you enjoy! I know we do."}
{"text":"Fast service and great food! Servers were very nice. Delicious rolls and appetizers. Wait was bit longer than expected but it was well worth the wait. Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Sushi was ok but the service was on the slow side! The waitress was not on top of her game. I don't think we will return...."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here and loved the sushi. They had some rolls that were different from everyone else and tasted awesome. The salads were also very well done. It is a smaller place but we liked the feel of it."}
{"text":"Very good sushi, really enjoyed everything. Takes a little longer than I'm used to,  but they were pretty busy. Very nice service. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Once of the best all you can eats that I have been to... and the first one that I have been to that has the rock and roll (fish in cucumber, no rice) on the ayce menu. They also have some sashimi type plates on it too! 

The reasons I did not give them a fifth star is because they were slow making some of the rolls (there were four sushi chefs and not too many customers) and hostess kept trying to take the one menus from my boyfriend that he still wanted to look at."}
{"text":"This was a nice surprise! The atmosphere was nice, we got great friendly service; the sushi was delicious and was delivered to our table quickly. There were vegan options too! We only had a short time to eat, but look forward to going back for their all you can eat sushi!"}
{"text":"Cool place hidden away near Aliante. Went there on a guys night out based on a recommendation by friend. We consider ourselves sushi experts, but maybe amateur is more accurate.
2 chefs at bar with 3 preps. Wait staff very friendly, knowledgable and fast. we ordered all you can eat, reasonably priced at $26. Chef was on orders fast, fish portions larger than rice, rolls the same. Hot dishes were excellent. And a first for us, cold sparkling sake..wonderful!
Of course they have sashimi plates and appear to be good value. The fish was very delicious! Our new place to go for all you can eat. Must try roll - Sexy Roll."}
{"text":"I'm not even picky with my sushi but this place does not satisfy at all. 

There's other places that have tastier rolls and even presented better. 

My sister asked the waitress what the sangria special was that was written on the board. She said it's \"like wine but like with fruits\". It's literally a small bottled wine with one piece of orange... For $9. Ridiculous. 

I had ordered a chicken Katsu and let me warn you since they don't that it'll take 15 minutes and it wasn't even busy at all! I has to ask multiple people about it and no definite answer.

All in all, not coming back."}
{"text":"This place charged my credit card three times, then came back and lied to me saying they're system was down so I paid cash only to find out they charged me and didn't tell me later. Then the general manager David says he would give me $50 credit the next day. The next day he changes his mind and acts like a complete a$$hole to me. 0/5 stars."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in Vegas! Every time I come to town I always stop in!!!! It's the best!!!!!"}
{"text":"No thanks.  I ate it without any biological consequences but I think that was just luck, because the tuna was gross.  I eat sushi all the time and prefer anything with tuna in it, so I am very particular about the freshness and this place just doesn't cut it.  Reminded me of picking up a California roll from a convenience store cooler...edible but far better choices are available, all nearby."}
