{"text":"We arrived here by accident. We took the Wards Island Ferry because it was the first one to arrive, and we wanted to get out of the city. On the island, the sign at the ferry dock announced that there was a music festival at the cafe.  The food is real. Full of flavour and fresh things, beautifully laid out. They were totally welcoming of a tired grown person and an overly energetic small person, and the wait staff were charmed by his ordering. Warning, the chipotle humus is hot - I loved it, but it was too hot for the two year old. Every thing else was excellent.  If they have the white chocolate coconut cake, get it. We watched two other tables order pieces, and based on their facial expressions we ordered one. It really was fabulous, and I don't like white chocolate. Two tables later they ran out. Don't be the one who does not get cake.  Also, the red sangria. If you drink alcohol, drink the red sangria. The white is fine, but the red is what you want.  I'm plotting a return, which is saying something considering the ferry and all."}
{"text":"The prices are outrageous ($2.00 plus tax for a 500 mL bottle of water??).  The staff are slow and not very customer-oriented (staff more concerned with restocking items than with waiting on customers).  I won't go there again.  I'll leave that to people who think high prices and crappy customer service are signs of sophistication. (Why do unfavourable reviews get \"filtered\"?  Is this supposed to be a glee club or a genuine rating service?)"}
{"text":"This joint is the saving grace of Station Square. It is dirt cheap and doesn't hide behind a fake wall of pretension. The guys behind the counter are really great and pleasant to talk to. The food is cafeteria style decent and priced really well. I was staying at the Sheraton and there is no way in hell I would purchase any of their overpriced food nor was I going to gouge myself in the surrounding crap-hole chains surrounding it. I don't even care what they're called Steeler's cafe or Island Cafe whatever as long as they make a straight no frills breakfast with two eggs, toast and bacon for a couple of bucks whatever!"}
{"text":"The cafe is in one of the most beautiful spots in Toronto. They are growing most all the greens they use right in their garden, any other produce from Ontario Food Terminal and meats from Sanigans. Great sangria and the Jimador is refreshing.   Daily specials are the best - fried chicken, chicken dinners, pizzas, fish. Every thing is done in beauty and they make every effort for a light footprint and to improve the community and place that supports and sustains them.   Free kale on Tuesday harvests from a pilot project with the city to see how many pounds of kale can be grown in a city park on 1/100th of an acre. 5-7pm I think.   Just beautiful. I love having a morning coffee there early before it's too crowded on one of the many benches trellised with sweet peas and other gorgeous blooms."}
{"text":"Popular small venue means very busy and crowded unfortunately. Service was a little slow on a Sunday evening, but the place was very busy. Staff seemed reasonably friendly.  The beer was cold and tasty. The Jerk Winner Winner Chicken Dinner? The chicken was very tasty, but the rice and peas with bland and cold. The deep fried plantains were way overcooked and burnt. The collared greens were meh - I don't eat them often so I don't know if they were any good.  Would I visit again? Ya, probably."}
{"text":"I think the staff have a serious case of grumpy.   I came in and asked a few people if they were in line. Turns out they were employees, and instead of answering \"no\" they just huffed at me and walked behind the counter. Sorry...  Then I asked the lady at the takeout counter if they did takeout. She rolled her eyes and said \"yeah\". When I asked for the menu, she motioned behind her to a messy chalkboard sign and said \"um, it's right here...\" Rude.   I wasn't super into any of the takeout meals, so I asked to see a dine in menu. They told me they don't make anything on the menu for takeout, so I could only see it if I waited for a table. And then she walked away, shaking her head obnoxiously.   I totally would have dined in had I been treated with respect. Instead, I waited for the next grumpy staff member come to the counter and I ordered a hot dog that took 20 minutes to cook. Had I not been starving, I would have left. It cost way too much.   Learn to smile, Island Cafe! You're in one the most beautiful parts of the city!"}
{"text":"The food and the setting are wonderful.  Everything else, which is basically the staff, is not.  Sure it's busy in the summer and things can go slowly.  But in the fall, on a quiet morning there should be no excuse for such rude and slow service.  We were informed - with a huff and a rude \"we don't open until 11:30.  You have to wait\" - that seating wasn't open until 11:30 so we opted for the take-out bar.  This was at 11:21.  There were 2 parties of 2 ahead of me and the counter-service girl was so insanely slow that these 2 coffees, 2 juices and a nectarine took her 13 minutes to serve. I know this because by the time she was taking my order, I was informed breakfast wasn't served after 11:30. I looked at my clock:  11:34.  I told her I had been waiting in line for nearly 15 minutes.  She rolled her eyes and asked someone if we could have one more breakfast.  Now it was his turn to grumble and grudgingly say \"I guess so\" and then turn to the kitchen and loudly say \"Sorry guys, but we have to do one more breakfast even though it's after 11:30\"  ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?  If your service was at a normal pace - I would have ordered before 11:30.   The second part of my order was a hot dog.  I was told they might not be ready.  Sooooooo, you don't serve breakfast at 11:30 but you don't have your hot dogs ready for your lunch? That makes sense.  Finally, we got our food.  But the hot dog was raw and my husband had to take it back.  No apology and then they asked if he wanted his money back or another hot dog.  Then he was told that the hot dogs weren't ready so he can have his money back or nothing.  Fine.  They gave him stale tortilla chips that took forever to put into a paper bag.    The food and coffee, when you get it, is delicious.  And to the other reviewer who says you should relax and enjoy the island vibe - well that's all fine and dandy if the island vibe is rude and dismissive.  I would be okay with the slow service if it was at least service with a smile.    It's a family run business and probably doesn't have to rely on service for business as there are only two places to eat on Ward Island.  But will be bringing a picnic next time and skip trying to deal with the incompetent staff"}
{"text":"Went there last Sunday (June 9, 2013) when the weather was beautiful. Island Cafe is a picturesque place with a gorgeous patio, located close to the ferry dock, on the edge of a park on Ward Island.  There is so much potential. Our server was quite friendly and accommodating and the setting made it earn 2 stars; but otherwise, it would have been one.  The menu was limited, fries only available on \"Frydays\", chicken wing special only available after 5:30pm. No big deal as there were other things to choose from. The intention of a smaller menu is usually to simplify work in the kitchen so that speed and quality can be emphasized.  We ordered a pitcher of beer, two orders of shrimp, and two orders of nachos. The beer took 15 minutes and our appetizers took 45 minutes to arrive. Each order of shrimp was six or seven shrimp with a side of watery tamarind dipping sauce. The nachos were basically toasted chips with hardly any cheese or toppings. We did opt for two add on guacamole orders at $2.50 each, for about two tablespoons of guac.   The whole thing  along with one glass of wine (just some sub-par appetizers and essentially 4 drinks) came to just over $80 after taxes and gratuity. This would have been reasonable for good quality food; but from what I observed, the food gets better attention at a fast food chain.  I sincerely hope that Island Cafe can improve their quality and speed rather than just rely on their location monopoly. Otherwise Torontonians will catch on and save their appetites for the mainland."}
{"text":"Lovely location but oh so pricey, and the portions were oh so small.  The waiter was a nice guy, but did I mention that we got 12 chips for $10.  And the dessert was the size of a toonie for $10.  If you are going to Ward Island, pack a lunch."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Great atmosphere,  great food, friendly staff  They grow their own greens!!   Highly recommend a stop here!"}
{"text":"My experience here was terrible from start to finish. First, the host (who also ended up being our server) needs a major attitude check. She acted exasperated when we asked simple things like where the bathroom was located, etc.  They were out of literally all alcohol listed on their menu except what they were calling a \"margarita.\" Every surface I touched seemed to be sticky. The nachos my mom ordered looked like Tostitos scoop chips with sprinkle cheese that was nuked in the microwave...for $15. Such a bummer for our last meal while visiting Toronto. I am not usually one to write reviews, but I don't want other people to waste their money here!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Grumpy wait staff. Argued with us when we did not receive what was listed on the menu, and didn't waive the charges. Totally ruined our experience but the food was mediocre anyways.  The only redeeming quality is the patio. Hit the rectory instead."}
{"text":"Went here with my cousin during my trip to Toronto. We came here around lunch time on a weekday, so we were seated immediately and had the option to choose our seats as well. Service was amazing--our waitress was extremely patient and helpful with the menu. The place overall has a really nice aesthetic as well--located on Toronto Island, with beautiful seats and a very homey vibe.   Now, what makes me give it 3 stars is the food. Yes the service and environment is important, but the food is what MAKES the restaurant. We both ordered fish and chips just to keep things light and were greatly disappointed. The. fish. was. so. dry. OMG. I have never had anything so dry it was as if I had consumed the Sahara or something. The chips were also just basic fries--nothing special there. For the price, I was definitely expecting more. We skipped on dessert just because we didn't want to risk it. However, we did get a sangria which was quite nice.   Overall, nice vibe, cute place, terrible food. I really hope they work on the food because this place as a lot of potential."}
{"text":"I bought a Reuben and fries to go around 8 pm on a Sunday night; both were super greasy, even for Pittsburgh. (I lived here for 6 years and know Pittsburgh greasy). Yeah, I know, I ordered a Ruben, but sandwiches shouldn't make spongey noises when you pick it up!"}
{"text":"Wow I wouldn't have guessed there would be so many horrible reviews based on my experience there. Visited in the middle of the afternoon so it wasn't too busy and we were seated right away. The hostess was nice enough, but our server seemed a little out of it.. not too friendly, took forever to get back to our table... a little hazy if you know what I mean.. The food was good, fish and chips was not overcooked. Really good tartar sauce. The patio is ADORABLE. Like if you're the person to just go somewhere for the aesthetics- go here. Sunflower print tablecloths, umbrellas, sting lights, fresh flowers on the table, a garden behind the dining area. The ambiance and the views plus the good food made me not care about the subpar service. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"The place is an absolute disaster. There are no signs indicating the different areas. Staff is grumpy and huffs at the guests especially the lady at the cash today.   The place is not organized   People in their bikini are allowed to enter  into the eating area which is not very hygienic"}
{"text":"This place is conveniently located on one side of the island and has the cutest garden surrounding the restaurant. The patio was especially cute and has great views of the garden. It was late evening and luckily there wasn't a wait to get seated but service was a tad slow. In all fairness, it was slow because there was a wedding on the other side of the restaurant which is catered by them. Anyway, back to the food... We ordered the patatas brava, garden basil fritters and fish tacos. All were tasty and washed down with the homemade kombucha."}
{"text":"Ran over here for a quick lunch. I had the gyro which another worker said he picked up as well. I have had quite a few gyro's (pronounce  gy-ro here for some reason; east coast thing?) so I do have some experience eating these things.  It wasnt exactly what I expected. I agree with the previous review that the meat did taste a little funny. But the white sauce... I hope you sure like garlic, because it was a heavy garlic sour cream thing that was pretty runny. It was very large (more than I could handle) so I ate about half. The pita was pretty tasty though..."}
{"text":"I expected the prices to be much higher since there are not that many other places to go to once you're at the islands. but the prices are great!  couches on a veranda is a win! also chess tables, yard tables with a cute front yard garden, bicycle parking and lounge chairs!  and a good ice cream and lots of different types of coffee and tea.   the staff wasn't super excitingly friendly but not rude either.  Nice spot."}
{"text":"Half the tables were empty and they still couldn't be bothered to bring me a menu (I got my own) or even come over to take my order after 15 minutes. Ridiculously bad service."}
{"text":"The Island Cafe is a cute little place right off the path from the Ward's Island ferry dock. It was recently featured on CBC radio but I came across it on a bike tour around the islands. It's only been open for a couple months and is under new ownership by a local Ward's Island family.  The cafe is situated on a porch facing the north shore of Ward's Island. There is covered seating and couches on the porch, plus picnic tables and chairs out on the lawn. The place has a very campy feel to it.  Ward's Island is the main neighbourhood island of the Toronto Islands so this cafe attracts a mix of locals, city folk and tourists but definitely nothing compared to the hot mess of tourists on Centre Island.   I opted for a veggie dog which turned out to be one of the sausage-sized variety that looking very much like a real wiener. It came in a massive bun and was accompanied by your basic toppings of relish, mustard, and ketchup. At $4.20(taxes included), it was great value for the money and decently filling.  The next person to order one at my recommendation was really taken a-back when she saw it, asking if it was really a veggie dog.  The Island Cafe also has a good selection caffeinated drinks but it was way too hot for me to even consider an iced coffee so I went for the natural selection of the white jumbo freeze pop and was off on my bike adventure again.   I would come back here to try the veggie burger or the burrito and some of their drinks."}
{"text":"visited on a Saturday, loved it so much came back on the Sunday and loved it again  Tried various items over the two visits, but what really made a difference especially when compared to the nearby Rectory Cafe, 5 minutes away was the staff, it is a family owned and run restaurant, it shows    Home Smoked Fish board WOW $11, and great starter the Kale Salad, Fish Tacos, Chicken Mole, all great,   Deserts really brought it home. Tarts layer cakes $6. and great  fine selection of wine and biers, light and dark  The Island Cafe is a folksy  place right off the Ward's Island ferry dock"}
{"text":"Woahhh...there's so much anger in the other reviews. Close your eyes and listen to the lake waves and chirping birds on this scenic island landscape. Look in front of you. It's a homegrown garden in a little bathtub against a backdrop of floating boats. How can you get angry?   So there seems to be a trend here that says the service is horrible. I don't know if the weekend staff is different from the weekday staff (went on a Thursday afternoon), but whaaaat? These guys were some of the nicest, most mellow people that I've ever come across in a restaurant. And this place was bustling (there was an event on the island). They forgot our items a couple times and we had to remind them, but each time, they had a great attitude about it. Everyone was very polite about any questions we had. The ice cream guy asked twice if there was anything he can get for me.  Can't complain about the food either! Ordered a smoked fish board expecting the regular slices of grocery store smoked salmon. It came out as a beautiful filet on a bed of homegrown kale and pickled onions. The only thing that made it better was my iced latte, which was deliciously creamy. They even have a finishing station with all types of sugar (simple syrup and honey included) and milk, perfect for any drink.   Honestly, this was a perfect island escape across from a city that is riddled with transit troubles and housing headaches. My advice? Take your date here. Too bad this place is so far from me, but I'm willing to keep up this long-distance relationship. Wait for me, Island Cafe, I'll be back to to sip coffee by the lake and eat your freshly grown veggies soon.  (60/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"First things first... You're on the island. Your day should be a leisurely exploration of outdoor space and not rushing around with timelines. So with that being said, yes, the service can be a bit slow here. But given there is literally only this or the Rectory Cafe to choose from on this stretch of the island, it should be no surprise the place gets busy and servers may be more tied up that one would hope... So my advice is to chill out and take this in stride rather than being impatient.  Once you get past any initial wait for a table and then subsequent wait for the waitress to actually tend to your table, things will turn around. The food is good (burger and fries for $15 was a very satisfying lunch, and nothing on the menu is over $18), the beer is reasonably priced ($6.50 + tax for a craft pint of Mill Street or Sidelaunch beers), and the atmosphere is lovely.  Also, to correct the review below - there are washrooms, they are around the back of the place near the lawn bowling.  If you're really impatient, just go to the takeout section. While the menu is different and it can also get busy, they do seem to work through the line pretty efficiently. Otherwise, take your time, chill out and enjoy your day with a stop into the Island Cafe."}
{"text":"I like the Island Cafe because for one, the food is fresh. They have a smoker so they smoke their own meats and salmon. This is the best spot to eat in the entire island. It's cute, cozy and the food is good BUT, the staff needs to look a little bit more presentable and clean. We've been there several times and it's always the same. The other day there was a waitress that looked a little too dirty for my liking. She had bug bits all over that were bloody (SO gross),and her clothes looked dirty. If it wasn't for the staff looking a little too raggedy, I'd give this place 4 stars! Please please have the staff clean up a little bit. It's a big turn off for such a nice place."}
{"text":"Adorable little place, but slow service at the counter. We waited 20 minutes for two veggie dogs. They forgot part of our order. We wanted to order ice cream, too, but it just took forever!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on a Friday afternoon while visiting Toronto islands. The place wasn't very busy, with only a few tables occupied. Our food came out fairly quickly, we tried the quesadilla and the beef burger, both were pretty decent.   What I actually enjoyed about this place was the amazing outdoor atmosphere and the friendly staff. Each table had fresh flowers on it and they had a really cool outdoor garden. You also get a great view of the water and the city skyline."}
{"text":"I had a gyro combo ($8.30 w/ tax) which came with the sandwich, fries and a drink. The lady behind the counter understated the cost of adding the combo option when she told me verbally and I didn't pick up on it until I had already paid and was looking at the menu while waiting for my food. The gyro tasted pretty bad. The meat tasted a little funny, it was completely greasy, and the sauce was super thin, runny and did not taste entirely like cucumber sauce. The fries were good though as the batch was freshly made for my order.  I will most likely not eat here again since first impressions mean a lot. And seriously, if you cannot put together a gyro properly, the rest of the items must not be that good either.  Food Quality/Taste = 2 Stars Portion Size Given Price = 2 Stars Price = 2 Stars Service = N/A Experience with Staff = 3 Stars (she was nice, except for the price fib) Decor = 2 Stars"}
{"text":"We had about 40 minutes until the ferry back to the city.  Saw the sandwich board on the dock and decided to stop in for a drink.  The sign said wait to be seated.  We waited and for awhile and no one acknowledged us so we went and sat at the bar.   Staff weirdly avoided eye contact and one was dancing to 90s rap.  We smiled and waited patiently and were totally ignored.  They were not busy and certainly saw us but 6 staff members ignored us.  No \"we will be with you in a sec\" they just stood around talking to each other and ignored us.  After about 10 minutes of this we left.  Seems like a nice place, too bad the service sucks.  We were talking about going there for dinner sometime.  The food looked good.  No way I'd set foot in there again."}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of this place last year, but things seem to have gone down hill for their opening weekend (perhaps an aberration?).  Came here with family for brunch. We ordered a variety of things from the menu including eggs benedict, tofu scramble and a sandwich.   I had the benny and it was as bland as can be. A barely toasted english muffin with some avocado and tasteless hollandaise served with about 10 cubes of potatoes that were insufficiently cooked. My partner had the tofu scramble and it was also bland - no flavour whatsoever.   The server was pretty good - he was friendly but clearly had too many tables since he was being flagged down by everyone for things like ketchup and drinks. The food came decently quickly. It's just a shame that it sucked. We chose this place over the Rectory which is more expensive but I'd be happy to pay extra for palatable food.   I'll be giving this place another shot later in the season, but if it's similar to this experience I'll be relying on the Rectory from then on."}
{"text":"Since my first review there has been a significant improvement to this seasonal restaurant. The food is still very much cafe fare but the fish and chips is a favourite. Reasonable selection of wine by the glass. It can get very busy during sunny evenings. Their early closing and limited opening days in Spring and Fall can make it a challenge. The kitchen closes early except in high summer. There is no indoor seating so it's weather dependant. It's a fun place to while away a warm evening."}
{"text":"This cafe is fantastic! It has a comfortable cottage aura with a sprawling garden patio. The vibe perfectly reflects the island, and the menu is outstanding. You must try the smoked fish board."}
{"text":"Very nice place and decent food. Menu choices are limited and the place is packed and busy (especially on a clear day) give yourself enough time.  When you get here, there are two options take away or sit down service, since the take away line is first most people invariably stand in that while waiting for a table. Make sure you check and ask."}
{"text":"Why all the haters? The island cafe is not fine dining and you're not in a big city resto. Relax enjoy the slower pace (that's why you came to the island today isn't it?) and be thankful you don't need to rush to get back to work after you gobble down your quick lunch at your desk, like you did for the last five days.   We stopped in after a day of biking on the island and had lunch. Reasonable food (club house and kids grilled cheese sandwiches with salad and fries) at reasonable prices. Given that there is virtually no competition the fact that you can sit on their patio and sip a cold lemonade for $2.25 was completely unexpected.   Sure it was a bit slow getting the bill. The place was super busy and the waitstaff have to navigate some pretty narrow walkways between tables. Those 10 extra minutes waiting for the bill was just another 10 extra minutes enjoying the beautiful weather.   I go there every time we go to the islands if not for a meal then for some of their awesome ice cream."}
{"text":"Definitely a cute cute cute atmosphere. Nice big veranda with couches tables and chairs. Have not even seen the inside yet.   But I ask you Island Cafe, why are the grilled cheese sandwiches ONLY for children?? But if you add a tomato slice onto the sandwich and a dollar onto the price (you seemed to just make this weird rule up on the spot) then it is suddenly fit for adult consumption? This is wacky and makes no sense. I hate things that don't make any sense!"}
{"text":"This is my fav place to get a bite on the island. I'm not vegetarian but the vege burger is amazing! Its bright pink so I guess it's made with beetroot, very moist and delicious. It's often busy and can be a hot mess at times so get your food to go, sit on the grass and enjoy."}
{"text":"the spot is no doubt picturesque and it's a lovely place to relax.   the food, drinks, service and value aren't great though.   even all this is forgivable given the island location, but i've concerns about food safety. there are flies swarming about the fruit, blenders and garbage. seems like a disaster waiting to happen."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot, for all the reasons others have mentioned--above all, the beautiful location--but recently I've noticed a couple of issues: 1) food is somewhat overpriced for portions that small. Yes I get that it's all local organic ingredients etc, and that the meat is from Sanagans, and that there's an overhead for having to get the ingredients over from the city. But when \"small plates\" start at $10... and those plates are REALLY small ($11 for a few pieces of smoked fish and some crackers, $2 extra for cream cheese???) - that's a bit of an issue. It can also be hit and miss--the staff really like to claim that the burgers are amazing, but the one I had recently was extremely overcooked and definitely not worth the $16 I paid.  2) Service can be really iffy. I paid $8 for a watermelon slushy with a shot of rum, but when it came there was no rum in it. Literally, not a whiff. I took it back to the bar and said \"I don't think there's any rum in this\" and the bartender just said \"Well I put rum in it.\" Maybe he spritzed some rum scent on it and called that a shot? I don't know, but there was zero taste or smell of alcohol, after drinking it I was still stone cold sober. I don't mind at all if people make mistakes, but please don't pretend you didn't and then charge me $4 for a nonexistent shot of alcohol."}
{"text":"Brilliant buzzing busy!!! Just on approaching the cafe...it is buzzing with people either waiting to get served for take-out or waiting to be seated for table service. I opted to take-out because it was very busy & the sun was pounding down on me. Expected high prices but good quick service nonetheless - would visit again!!!"}
{"text":"Eeew. Bad gyros ya say? I did see two gyro spits. I guess it was a good thing that it was about 9AM when we came down here, as we were in need of a bite before boarding the magic bus to Ozzfest with our new friend Randy from Kansas.   No, not the band, the state. Yeah, he came all that way. Nice dude. Anyway, we had breakfast with him.   It's also a good thing that we opted for the somewhat cafeteria-like Island Cafe instead of Station Square's Subway.   I got an orange pop and a breakfast sandwich on white bread with bacon and cheese and was pretty pleased. They made it right in front of me with real eggs. The sandwich filling was thick, the bread toasted, the bacon fried by someone who obviously knows the short order cook business. For under 5 bucks, I got so full, all I needed to buy foodwise at the First Niagara Pavilion was a pretzel, thereby avoiding a gouging.   I dunno, I liked this place and appreciated the friendly service. Considering their trailer-wide menu (they have a lot of stuff!), dirt-cheap prices (yeah, at Station Square no less) , and extended hours (they're open early, even on weekends and close at 6PM at the earliest), I'll probably come by again.  Pssst. If a really strong gyro is what you crave, go to It's Greek To Me in Brookline."}
