{"text":"Slow serving, dirty place, windows are damaged, food is over cooked. I can't give more than one star!!"}
{"text":"I been wanting to stop at this joint for a couple years and see how the food was. I finally tried it today and I am really pleased.  The mixed grill platter is very good. The meat is well seasoned and juicy. Salad is delicious!  I called the order in and it was ready right on time. This might be my new go to place for a quick dinner!"}
{"text":"I noticed that there has been a change in the chef and management. Previously, it was worthy to drive all way long from east cleveland but now, with the change i really don't think its worthy.  Falafel would be a good option..
I am not sure whether it was a temporary change. Hope it is.."}
{"text":"I am so sad Kabab-G closed. While visiting Cleveland this was one of my favorite memories. The food was incredible and the atmosphere was \"unique\"."}
{"text":"Great Kababs !!!! Both ground beef shish kabab and the chicken kabab. Best thing is everything is under $10. This was the best fattoush that I have had in Cleveland. Everything is made fresh - you can tell !!! I found this place by word of mouth and visited couple of times. Very small place with 3 - 4 tables. Good for take-out. They have privet lot for parking too. This is one of the best lebanese food I had in Cleveland and also its damn cheap !!!! Few suggestions:  the place is cash only (probably a $20 bill will be good for a dinner for two !!), Opens @ 11 AM and closes @ 9:00 PM, closed Monday and Tuesday. One more advantage is the ease to find the place. Its just off the West 117th street exit from I-90."}
{"text":"We came here over the weekend to try some Iraqi food. I love kabobs, so I was excited to have it for lunch. The place is not exactly spectacular, but all I really care about is how good the food is. There was some nice tea, hot and ready for customers to drink while waiting for their orders. I love little touches like this when I come to restaurants. We ordered a mixture of appetizers so we could try everything; the plate included hummus, baba ghanoush, and kibbeh. The pita was served cold, which disappointed me. I like warm bread when dipping into the appetizers. It almost felt like they just took it out of the bag and served it to us. For the main meal we got a mixed kabob grill platter, since they were out of their special. This included Iraqi kabob, chicken kabob and beef kabob. The cubes of beef were way too hard, and I refused to eat more than the first piece I tried. The chicken was not bad and my favorite of the three was the softer beef kabob. The rice was not bad with the meat platter, but in the end I was underwhelmed. Seems like fellow yelpers mentioned a change in chefs over the years, so perhaps before the food used to actually be good? And I was puzzled because I couldn't really make a distinction as to which part of my meal was really Iraqi cuisine? All the food that I ate I could find in most middle eastern restaurants. It would be nice to have at least a couple distinct dishes if you are going to specifically say you are serving food from a certain region."}
{"text":"Kabab-G has great food! The falafel is light and fluffy. The kabobs are a tasty treat and a single kabob can be ordered. I ordered the falafel with pickled vegetables and got pickled cucumber and turnips! They were delicious and I was also served fresh tomatoes and lettuce. I highly recommend the food. There are only a few tables and it takes a while to get the food, but it is more than worth the wait."}
{"text":"Ghazi is no longer the chef there. Kumar S is right indeed. It is not as good unfortunately."}
