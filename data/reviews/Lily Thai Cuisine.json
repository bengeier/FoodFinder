{"text":"Had lunch there. Nice atmosphere. Food well prepared and good quality. Well presented. Prices as expected. Free parking in back appreciated."}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed Lily Thai on Ashby field rd in Brampton and we decided to stay local this time and try the G'town location...Did not have the best experience to say the least on Fri night. The acoustics are terrible in the converted century home that the restaurant is in. Could not have a conversation without straining or repeating. While it was busy, we were seated quite quickly. However, I've always been of the opinion that the table should be fully set before leading your patrons to sit. This was not the case and our dinnerware, cutlery, water etc were added after we sat. The server also reached across the table to place items on the opposite side when should have walked around. No condiments, no centre piece. Waiter was not unpleasant but seemed lacking in some very basic serving and cust svc skills. No greetings, no intro, no energy. Very robotic.
Table next to us were eating apps when we sat then didn't get mains for over 30 mins after that. And when they did it had a twist tie in the noodles. On the other side of us was an older couple who had the same waiter and just as many issues. I swear this was the waiter first shift ever doing anything in a restaurant setting!
So onto to our dinner...dumplings, pad thai, drunken noodles and what was supposed to be chinese style fried rice that ended up being the wrong dish...all came out at different times, one serving spoon amongst 3 dishes and portions no where near size of Brampton location. Our bill was wrong and had to be fixed then on my way out, I was accused of taking the merchant copy of the bill. So many things could have been better imo. Use the Brampton store as a model to make this place better! I may just have to stay with the Brampton one."}
{"text":"One of our \"go to\" places for a last minute meal - have done take out and dine in.  Never disappointed.  Love the pumpkin soup and the Thai coconut soup.  Have had the pho and the Bangkok style pad Thai, spring rolls etc, all had been very good!  Lunch specials during the week are good value.  Service has always been timely and friendly."}
{"text":"Our family loves Lily Thai! My favourite dish is the Green Curry w/ Shrimp + Coconut Rice. 

We mainly order in. Because the restaurant is small and cozy Lily Thai is great place for more intimate get togethers. 

The staff are very friendly and attentive. If we are picking up an order to go - we are never disappointed - it's always a quick turnaround. 

Family favourites: Pad Thai - Bangkok Street Style w/ Beef, Calamari, Mango Salad, Spring Rolls. I'm making myself hungry!"}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food! Fresh and all made in house. The owners are friendly and the place is spotless! Cannot say enough good thing about this place. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I have to give this place a 2 stars review not for their food quality but the owners customer service manners. 
They don't know anything hung about customer service. They're busy because of their good food and they've let that get to their head. 
They do not appreciate your business. 
The long haired oriental cook has no manners or people skills. 
Last time I ever went to that place was when I bought $115 of take out and I simply asked the girl to give me an extra sauce that can not cost more than $.05 and he yelled at the girl saying she better charge me for it. I believe it was $.75. Not that the money would make a difference but it's the principle. It was enough to stop me from going in there at least once a week."}
{"text":"Actually thought this place was really tasty.  I've only order takeout but the portions were very generous and the owner is very kind."}
{"text":"Great food in small nicely done place in Downtown Georgetown!!! Loved Cold mango rolls... Must come again!!!"}
