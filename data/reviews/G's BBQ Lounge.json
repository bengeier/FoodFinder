{"text":"I was disappointed for take out. I ordered to pick up,  hoping good BBQ would make up for the price.  

The atmosphere may add value with entertainment,  but for takeout the food must stand on its own.  It did  not. The pulled pork sandwich was swimming in liquid and the bottom bun was too soggy to eat.  There was a huge chunk of fat that made me wonder what kind of pulling they really did. 

It's so close to me - I'm disappointed I can't go back."}
{"text":"Disappointed that the place closed. It was nice to have a bar in our area that catered to a wide range of people."}
{"text":"Dont waste your time, this place is a joke. Service is horrible, probably because a bunch of kids are running it.I will not be back"}
{"text":"The BBQ and atmosphere is great the side foods on the other hand are mediocre at best. Have been disappointed with every side I have ordered."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a Saturday for a date night,  which doesn't happen often with us because we have a toddler.   

We both decided to order the ribeye steak.  The menu said the steak was 16 ounces but when we got our order it was clear our steaks were a lot smaller. We were very dissapointed with how pitiful our meal looked.   

We told a waitress (who we later found out was the owner's wife) that the steaks did not look like 16 ounces. She looked at our plates and said she would find out. She returned and said that they ran out of 16 ounce steaks.  She informed us our bill would be lowered. 

Our regular waitress came out and said she thought the steaks were really small and laughed. She also informed us our bill would be lowered. When our bill arrived only 20% was taken off.  We ordered a $22, 16 oz steak and got a 5 oz steak instead. I don't think that 20% was enough.   

It was very poor service to give us a smaller steak without asking and then trying to pass it off as the regular item.   They should have told us right away that they ran out of the steaks.  

I can say that the restaurant looks nice and the band they had playing that night was really good.   They played old school R&B. However I don't see myself eating there again."}
{"text":"This was my first time, and it won't be my last! Great food, excellent & friendly service, and you get what you pay for. The BBQ is WAAAAAAY better than Rudy's. Those place is a 5-Star for sure!"}
{"text":"Ok called first about the open mike it hadn't started waitress said she didn't know when it would start.....ok so I drove there and while waiting I ordered food collard greens one of the sides....when the food came out cold and there was a fork full of greens in a cup filled with juice....FOOD AND SERVICE JUST AWFUL"}
{"text":"First timers!!  Walked in and was greeted right away by a bartender/server.  It was not busy, so we choose where we wanted to sit.  The server was very nice and attentive!!  We started with the lodes tater tots.  They were good, but cold.  For only having 2 tables in the whole restaurant, I expected hot food.  They were still good, just disappointing.  My husband ordered the 1/2 rack rib combo with brisket with beans and Mac and cheese.  I got the pulled pork chimis. Serve came back...no chimis.  Ok, so I got the house made chips with onion dip.  Nope out of those too.  So I just decided to share with my husband.  My food review...
Ribs were tender and good.  Brisket was tough but flavorful.  Mac and cheese was delicious!!! Corn was out of a can and microwaved, not impressive at all.  Beans tasted like bushes baked beans and were cold.  Then come the \"corn bread.\"  I swear this was a vanilla cupcake with no frosting.  Not one ounce of corn flavor.  But was a spongy cupcake, super weird.  

Overall, we won't be back.  Service was good,food not so much."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! Ordered a medium well burger and got it an hour later burnt!!! Waited on a drink for 40min...yes we had a big party, but we called months in advance to ensure they could handle it...service is horrible!"}
{"text":"I was hoping for so much more from a local restaurant
   We walked in to sit at the bar.  WOW...who designed this huge disaster.  Waaayyy to tall and no room to slide your bar stool under a counter edge. Looks like they are residential countertops from Home Depot.  
   As I walked up to the restaurant I could not smell any \"smoke\" in the air.  Once entering I could not smell any smoke in the building either.  My question to my wife was \"where are they doing this Bar-b-que??\"  It almost seems as they are using liquid smoke in an oven, then smothering it with their own Bar b que sauce.  That is just an assumption, and I can be wrong, but no smell of smoke in a bar b que place???
   The mac and chesse we thought was very good and their beans were good as well.  We will give it one more shot as it is a local place, but they have some work to do..."}
{"text":"the brisket was very good, asparagus had tons of water and looked old ,mac and cheese was a macaroni salad i couldn't describe if it was club nor  restaurant ,"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to G's BBQ Lounge in Litchfield Park.  The ambiance was unique and booths were comfortable.  The service was average +.  The food, on the other hand, was quite a disappointment.  The prices exceptionally high--especially for the amount of food on the plate-- the portions were very small.  I had the BBQ pork sandwich with BBQ Beans.  The sandwich was acceptable, but the beans tasted like they came directly out of a can of Campbell's Pork 'n Beans.  Very disappointing.  Our companions both ordered hamburgers with fries ($11.99, I think).  A generous portion of fries accompanied the burgers.  There were two patties (VERY small) on the bun--almost like the steakburgers at Freddy's, very thin. Unimpressive on the whole, and we probably won't be back.  Oops, forgot to say that the piped-in music was very nice."}
{"text":"Excellent barbecue and great service from Jessica tonight!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was not great, overheard them discussing our meals in the back. And food was not presented accurately in comparison to the menu. Cola was flat and tasted weird. But our server was very nice."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to G's BBQ Lounge this past Saturday night and we really enjoyed it. The atmosphere was nice and there was a nice crowd there as well. The band Level 9 was top notch, I enjoyed a hamburger, which was a nice size and very tasty. We plan on going back very soon. I hope G's BBQ Lounge stays around for a long time to come. It is nice to have this type venue in the west valley."}
{"text":"Went out with my neighbors last night as this place is nearby. Wanted to support local business. Ambiance is nice, band is great. Unfortunately, Food is not good. None of us enjoyed our meals and we each had BBQ, salmon, fried chicken, and burgers. I had salmon and it was undercooked. BBQ was dry meat with lots of sauce, no flavor. Service was also slow.

Would love to return only if menu/food improves. Maybe this should be bar food only... no fancy dishes."}
{"text":"This will be a one and done.  Service very slow for a dining room with only a few parties although the staff seemed nice.  Went looking to find BBQ ribs and they said they had none?!  A party come in after us and low and behold they were served a table full of ribs....   Guess it's good to be a super-friend.  

Our food was fair but not special and when delivered our plates were basically thrown down in front of us.  Definitely an execution issue."}
{"text":"Reading some of the reviews, and the lounge appearance from the outside can be a bit intimidating. Give this place a chance. The food was good, and service staff was highly attentive. They have different activities nearly every night. Swing dance lessons on Wednesday, comedy on Friday and live jazz on Saturday. They want your business, place was nearly empty on Tuesday. I hope business picks up, this place deserves to survive."}
{"text":"Great service on my to go order. I had a drink at the bar Top Shelf Long Island Iced Tea made great, while I waited for my order. I ordered the 16oz ribeye steak with sides of Mac n cheese (ok) and potatoe salad (not my favorite ). But the ladies waitress was wonderful great attitudes. I will be back to again."}
{"text":"The ribs were so tough that I needed a steak knife to come close to cutting through. The brisket was 50% fat. Half of our party never received their food. One of our party received his entree BEFORE his appetizer. The service was just not good (the server was very nice, just didn't do a good job) and drink orders took forever to get brought out.

There was an open mic comedy/music night going on. The sound system were so terrible you couldn't hear anything.

Very highly disappointed. For the prices charged, I expected WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY more.

Just an awful experience."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and regrettably the negative reviews are accurate. This place has the potential to be great but the service is awful! Every request took 30 minutes i.e. Beer, water and our check."}
{"text":"First off this place advertises as a BBQ restaurant- but we smelled no BBQ smoke or grilling of any sort inside or outside when we arrived. The place was empty on a weeknight at 6:30pm, which is unusual for the dinner hour. We were the ONLY table. Waitress was nice but very condescending and critical to us. I think she was trying to be funny & witty but her comments were rude. Big mistake to criticize & make BAD jokes to the only paying customers you have. We were a table of 4, our meals were served at different times, some being warm some being cold. One person in our party didn't get his food (the special of the day) until the rest of us were almost done eating. The ribs were tough, the brisket was ok, a little over cooked, collard greens were mushy, beans tasted like Bushes out the can, but hey the French fries were hot and good! I found it to be a little pricy $18-$25 per meal. I was REALLY rooting for this place to be a success, because we need more spots like this on the west side. The customer service aspect of a business is what will bring RETURN customers, which is when you make money, otherwise people will be one and done, and that's why businesses fail."}
{"text":"Don't even bother.  Service sucked period. Comedy night was exactly that.  Our friends held a table for 15 minutes before we showed.  20 minutes later no one had a drink yet.  Thats 35 minutes for the original couple.  Unacceptable.  Calamity Jane couldn't have pulled it off any better.  All six of us walked out.  Fortunately we did get our $10 cover charge back.  Bad for the entertainment people trying to make some money.  The restaurant caused that.  Appeared  to be a serious lack of management."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant/lounge for lunch as I like to try new restraunts at the lunch hour to see if I like the place or not. I can tell you that I will not be returning nor recommending this place to anyone for dining (can't speak to the lounge piece of this).  My wife and I were seated quickly and drink orders requested right away.  The problems began once the initial order was placed. Like others have said, the menu is literally hit or miss. I ordered the BBQ brisket sandwich with a side of baked beans and my wife ordered the BBQ plate with chicken and a side of mac and cheese. The server returned to our table apologetically stating that the restraunt is out of mac and cheese and continued that they do have beans, asparagus, and potato salad.  My wife continues to order the potato salad. A few seconds later, the server returns to our table to relay that they are out of beans as well... leaving my choices to asparagus and potato salad.  I ordered the asparagus and the food came out. Again, like others commented on here, there is no smell of anything BBQ either inside or outside and question whether or not the kitchen even has a grill. The BBQ plate looked like a shredded rotisserie chicken from the store with BBQ sauce plastered on it (no bread served with the BBQ plate just meat) and the brisket sandwich was a shredded pot roast with BBQ sauce. As for the sides, neither the potato salad or the asparagus had any distinguishable flavor. Save your money if BBQ is what you seek as this is most likely a lounge before its a restaurant."}
{"text":"The loaded tator tots are amazing! Totally the way to go. You can see the chef cooking from your table and he is having just as much fun as you are eating it. The only reason why I didnt give 5 stars is because the wait staff was not the best. I would have ordered more drinks and food but they hardly checked on us. Hopefully I can try it again and have someone else that is more helpful. But please go for the tots!"}
{"text":"The food , entertainment  and the drinks are bomb. So glad to have a nice 30 and up atmosphere in the West Valley.  Great location and the owner and staff are awesome."}
{"text":"I've tried some BBQ in several places across the nation. I must say this place is among the best! The sauce is absolutely savory. We tried the brisket and it was tender with crispy edges. I didn't want to stop eating. The staff was friendly and the talent was amazing. We are definitely coming back! Thank you for opening up on the west side!"}
{"text":"After reading the comments I was hesitant on going to this restaurant. But, I was pleasantly surprised as I soon entered G's lounge with the immaculate quality appearance and a friendly host. The customers were happy and smiling as conversations around the business were going on.  The waiter greeted me quickly as soon as I was seated. The professionalism was nothing short of outstanding.  As I ordered my meal I had the pleasure of listening to the house band which was top notched. My meal was delivered well within a reasonable time. It was not to hot and I felt the amount of food for the price was fair, asked my wife and she agreed. The taste was savory, tasteful, full of flavor and wanting me to come back in the future for more. 

 The feel for the restaurant/ lounge was smooth as the majority of the crowd from what we (my wife) noticed was a mature crowd (aka Grownfolk, born before 1980)
Methodical and extremely conscientious G's lounge layout and set up are well planned out. As I talk to one of the owners he displayed a keen interest on my comments and this lead me to believe that he wants to continue setting a high standard for him and his staff to maintain.

A few concerns on yelp I would like to comment on. 
It's a new restaurant; I believe there are going to be kinks and snares just like anything when it is new, bbut they have been fixed.

If you fill the price is to low or to high, let them know I am sure when they have meetings the owners will get together they will to a reevaluation..

 If you have a comment or concern I would recommend to voice it to the owner, they are very approachable; I believe they will try to make it right.

The owner Andre is a true professional in every since of the word. The courage of conviction and strong character he exhibits leads me to believe that he only wants the best for his costumers and staff.  If you want to stepout for a meal and relax, this is the place. I highly recommend G's Lounge without hesitation nor reservation."}
{"text":"We were so disappointed with this restaurant. The menu was limited because it was a Friday night which made no sense. The server said they would be changing the menu in the future. Not sure why they called a barbecue place as the number of barbecue items on the menu was very limited. The service was very slow and the server didn't know the difference between a draft and bottled beer. Prices were pretty steep. So sad since we love supporting new restaurants but we won't return."}
{"text":"Avoid this place like your life depended on it.  Worst customer service. People were up and leaving. I ordered a beer, asked for a menu. Beer came, bartender/waitress was then hustling food out to the tables, and 30 minutes later. I had enough waiting, took 5 minutes to get my change. I gave my money to the cook, and told him to give me change. Clueless, the entire staff (2). Place will be belly up this time next year. No one can get served around here.

Still hungry while I type this in their parking lot."}
{"text":"Came to check this out was recommended the brisket.   Ordered a brisket sandwich was amazing.  Will deff be back.  Staff was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Went yesterday, and it was empty. My friend and I were literally the only ones there. We both ordered the AZ cheesesteak, and the mac n cheese for our sides and it took FOREVER to come out, which is ridiculous when you're the only ones in the whole restaurant. The cheesesteak was alright overall, the meat was pretty good, could have used some more meat though, but the bread sucked. Very plain, and very thick. They could have at least been toasted and buttered or something. the mac n cheese was good, but it's hard to go wrong with mac n cheese. Staff was nice though. I love to support local small businesses, so I was hoping for it to be good, but I left very disappointed, hopefully after reading this review they will step it up a little."}
{"text":"Should have looked here at the reviews before trying this place. Walked in and the place is a weird hodge podge of nightclub booths, a huge u-shaped ugly bar, some tables pushed up against the walls, and a dance floor. They have a piece of a leather sectional sitting by the front door for seating. It looks like they just collected used furniture to open a restaurant and then decided to make it a bar too. The bar staff was friendly and helpful. 
I ordered my food take out to just give the BBQ a try. I know I am pretty picky about BBQ. We have traveled to US eating at BBQ joints. I was excited to hopefully just get some decent BBQ on the Westside. Not happening here. 
Ordered the brisket, pulled pork, and 1/2 chicken. Brisket is just OK but I really liked their sauce, the pulled pork was lost in all of the gristle, but the worst of the bunch was the chicken. It was so burnt, blackened, and dried out, it was inedible.  I tried a leg and then a piece from the breast and could not even swallow it without a drink. I threw it away and ate the sides. At least I could eat the Kraft Mac and Cheese they serve and the Bushes Baked Beans. Those I can stomach."}
{"text":"This was my third time. Once on a Saturday, 2nd time dropped in for a happy hour drink, and the 3th was on Friday for the comedy show.  With a party 10 to 13  people we all ate and enjoy the food. The staff very friendly and accommodating. The music on Saturday was very good everyone up and dancing. I will be back to dance again with my friends. Nice age group of people.  Everyone should give it a try you wont be sorry."}
{"text":"Don't go to this place if you have kids! Went in tonight and was informed that right side is a $10 cover for the comedians later or left side was to just eat. Sat down on the left side and waited for my friend and her son to arrive. The tea tasted like it started to go bad so they brewed fresh tea for us. Friend and her son arrives, we order then talked while we waited. Our food took so long, I finally asked when was it going to arrive. Finally everyone's food arrived but my friends son had already ate so he ordered cake. We were a quarter way through with our meal and no cake. Had to go up front because I think only one waitress was working to ask where is the cake. My friend ordered a sandwich with no onions and she had to pick onions out. The pulled pork was burnt and dry so again back up to the front to ask to see the Manager.  The Owner came to the table saying how a cook didn't come in so he was cooking and sorry for the wait/food. Then the comedian started and a little cussing but nothing that my friends son hasn't heard before. Then another comedian starts his act and he was not appropriate for a kid. I went back up to the front and asked why was I not informed by anyone that the comedians might not bevappropriate for kids. All the gentleman asked was Who sat you? The Owner, Manager and Waitress saw him and never said a word. We hadn't finished our food, but had to leave. Thank goodness the waitress brought our bill to us and with all the problems we received a 20% discount on our bill. Only the Waitress apologize for the comedian and stated next time they will inform people with kids about the comedian. Will never go back or recommend this place!"}
{"text":"A friend and I went for the Friday night comedy show.
We thought we might have some BBQ ribs, since it is a BBQ restaurant. Big mistake! We wanted to share a full rack, so we asked if they could cut the ribs into pieces, not hack them all up...I have never seen ribs hacked up that bad. I could have dealt with that, but all the taste was boiled out them and there wasn't even enough sauce on the ribs. There wasn't even a smell of BBQ inside or outside of the place.  The mac & cheese was a macaroni salad, didn't taste bad, but wasn't macaroni and cheese. The baked beans tasted like can beans and the corn bread was tasteless and tiny. The worst thing about the night was the owner screaming at his employees loud enough for us to hear him over the show. The comedians even commented that we could hear him out there and he just ignored them.  Continuing to yell at the employees, he was unprofessional.  I would not want to go back to eat at that restaurant I must say, the comedians, were ok some were very good. However the owner made it a horrible experience. You are a businessman please be professional and respect your customers and respect your employees if you want people to continue to come to your restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't give out 5 stars a lot, and if you were in here right now, you'd wonder why I did, as it's not busy whatsoever. It's because this place had everything I needed. Good service, awesome food, wifi, and atmosphere. I just needed a place to have lunch and take care of a little work.

I wasn't expecting to find a gem like this. One look and taste of the mac n cheese is all it takes to see why this place's food sets itself apart from others who try this American classic."}
