{"text":"Amazingly good. Great pad Thai and green curry though the red curry was my favorite. Great service and love the fruit infused water and the spectacular menus."}
{"text":"Awesome Pad See Eww with fried chicken at this place!! Loving it!! Great Atmosphere and service like always!"}
{"text":"When to eat lunch at this place today.  The place looks nice. We ordered beef salad, chicken satay, pad see ew, pineapple curry, papaya salad, and Tom yum Kai. We waited a long time for our food, since they only have one server and she was working very hard.  They need to improve their service by hiring more servers.  We heard the table next to us mentioned the same comment about the service even though they like the food.  

When our food arrived we gobbled up fast since all of us were very hungry by then.  The papaya salad was too spicy. It burn our tongue but we manage to finish it anyway. The pad see ew was excellent. It was our favorite dish. The bee salad was okay. I had to eat it all by myself since the others didn't want to eat it because of the rare beef. Our chicken satay did not come and instead they gave us chicken salad and it was just ok.  The Tom yum Kai soup was good.  The pineapple curry didn't come. They forgot it. So we instead we ordered another pad see ew. Overall the food was good but the service was slow and inconsistent because there wer only one service and she seem overwhelm.  I hope the service improve because the food is good. I like them to stay in business along time, but if they don't improve their service by having adequate staff.  They will not last."}
{"text":"Tried it out for the first time the other day. Got pad thai and the spicy noodles for take out. Taste and portions were great. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"There are three ways a restaurant can be successful:
1. Good Food
2. Good Service
3. Location, Location, Location

Hollywood Thai strikes out on all three. Let's take them one at a time.

1. Food.....I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai. It was 5:15 on a Saturday night we came in and NOBODY was there except us. The noodles in the Pad Thai were rubbery and stuck together as if they were prepared some time in the afternoon and pre-heated for dinner. Furthermore, the Pad Thai was served luke warm.
My girlfriend ordered the curried pork ribs (called the \"chefs specialty\" on the menu). The taste to be honest was pretty good. But you get three ribs and a little bok choy for $14.95......how do you say ripped-off in Thai? Most anywhere else in Vegas I can get at least a half slab of ribs for that price.

2. Service......Simply put, there wasn't any. Again, when we arrived there was nobody else in the place. But the waitress took our order, then when the order was ready brought us our food and we never saw her again until about 3/4 of the way through our meal when she re-filled our water glass. She NEVER stopped by our table to ask, \"how is everything\" or \"can I get you anything else\". No, the whole time we were eating she was either behind the cash register or in the kitchen.

3. Location.....The only reason we went to H-Thai was it was close to where we stayed (Tahiti Village) and we had a groupon (thank God we didn't pay full price for what we got). The place looks nice from the inside but it's in a dumpy location nowhere near anything else.

You want great Thai food? We've been going to Vegas for over 20 years now and have found the best thai restaurant is Krung Siam located in China Town.
As for Hollywood Thai.......I'd give even odds that this place will even be in business a year from now."}
{"text":"My spouse is Thai and also happens to be an incredible cook.  We also spend considerable time in Thailand so for a foreigner, my knowledge and experience with Thai food is extensive.

My wife, her son and myself went here for lunch recently.  I and my wife ordered Thom Yum noodle soup with ground pork.  I ordered spice level 8 (range of 1 - 10) and my wife ordered level 7.  We also ordered Pud See Ewe with pork.

My noodle soup was NOT spicy and was NOT sour.  Both flavor's are essential for a dish to be considered Yum.  I would say the spice level was about 4, certainly not approaching an 8.  My wife's noodles were also remarkably mild.  The broth instead of being slightly sour was in fact somewhat sweet.  I had to request fresh limes to adjust the flavor to the sour side.  The waiter also did not bring the condiments (dry chilies, vinegar, fish sauce, pickled peppers, etc.) which allow the customer to tailor the flavor to their own taste.

The Pud See Ewe was stir fried with too much sauce and as a consequence was more moist than it should have been.  This dish should be fairly dry when prepared correctly.

I found the prices on the high side, especially given the quality of the items ordered.

If you're seeking authentically prepared noodles, you will be more satisfied elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ordered the BBQ chicken & Seafood Fried Rice. I LOVE spicy & find it difficult to find an Asian restaurant that delivers truly SPICY. (I order a spice level 15 @,Archie's). Not only did they deliver but it was delicious! Definitely coming back! Much closer to the office than Lotus & the service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Ordered  a noodle soup from here with squid and shrimp. The seafood tasted rotten. The server did not understand me, and did not try. Talked to one speaks English and he did not even apologize for the bad food. I can make better soup than that. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Most AMAZING THAI FOOD EVER! Couldn't decide between the chicken or crab fried rice so we got BOTH n split them. We have been all over from Washington, Oregon, California n Vegas,
TRULY THE BEST BY FAR! Sweet young lady tended to us graciously. Wish we didn't have to go home. 
Will DEFINITELY COME AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Had the pad Thai lunch special. Pad Thai was ok at best. Server forgot to ask my spicy level, was missing some key ingredients inc peanuts, lime. Service was a bit slow but expected for a new establishment."}
{"text":"Food was ok, the saute was a bit different from what im use to. Had a different flavor from other thai places ive had. It was ok but its hard to compare to thai bbq my favorite."}
{"text":"Great thai place extremely authentic. Decor was pleasant not overbearing. Simple music and a TV just in case you're missing the game. Our server was awesome and was careful to tell us about the spice level. Check this place out and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best food !! Good price !! Awesome service !! Amazing place.
I like Pad thai and Tom Yum Noodle Soup .Everything fresh !!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, terrible service. Not dinging them on how baron the place is or the 30+ minute wait for just one dish but rather the lack of class or appreciation for the inconvenience. Next time try Sukan Thai a few miles east..."}
{"text":"Now that Sakun Thai is under new ownership and has been sucking royally, I am thrilled to find a new Thai place near my office. I came here with a co worker who is actually a very picky girl, and we both left satisfied. 

When we arrived the place was half full for lunch. The decor was actually very charming and Thai inspired. You can tell they are newly opened because they are still working out some kinks (certain beverages and food items on the menu, but not available or in stock).

They do offer several lunch options at very reasonable prices. I expected smaller lunch portion but was quite surprised at the generous portion that was served. The lunch includes a soup, egg roll and a main dish. My co worker opted for curry and I went off the menu slightly and ordered their pad kee mao. We shared our food and both thoroughly enjoyed everything that we tried. The pad kee mao did skimp on the shrimp slightly.. I think I counted 3, but it was delicious nevertheless. 

I am excited to return here for lunch and sample more of their menu. They are in the same lot on Warm Springs where A Thyme For All Seasons once was."}
{"text":"This place is no longer in business as of 8/8/15. And yet it still selling voucher in GROUPON. We bought a groupon voucher and hoping to enjoy a Thai meal today and when we finally got there, there is a sign showing the restaurant is NO LONGER IN BUSINESS. When we call the phone number listed on Groupon voucher and yellow page, we also got \"the number is not in service\". So we had to call Groupon to get our money back. We also asked Groupon to remove them so others won't have to deal with the refund and waste their gas getting there. But as of now, this restaurant still shows up in Groupon. What a joke!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.

Would not come to this location again.

The food is bad quality ... Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The best catfish I ever had. It was just so awesome... Find out about this place via groupon. The food and presentation were just truly fantastic"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Hands down great authentic thai food! My friend had a Groupon definitely will be coming back"}
{"text":"So it seems like this is a new business that needs to work out some kinks. So far they seem to recognize where they lack. The food made up for it and I already want more pad Thai! Online ordering is super convenient and they deliver!"}
{"text":"I purchased Groupon for this new restaurant near my house. From the outside the place looks small and plain but the inside is nice, clean. I ordered pad see ew, the server asked the spicy level I like, she said level 5 is the highest. I told her I like it really really spicy, make it more than level  5. When I tasted the food, I really like it. The chef made it the way I like it. She said its level 7. I don't even need to add additional chilies like I always do every time I go to Thai restaurant. Nice friendly server, good food and really close to my house, perfect!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Real crab in the crab fried rice. The coconut soup was decent and service was ok. The Groupon was well wotlrth it and the reason I added 1 star to make this a 4 star review. 

Location is weird and a bit sketch."}
{"text":"Great food.   Great service.   Incredibly nice people..

Green curry,  spicy rice and Thai jellie? 


Haven't gotten the jellie yet,  should be interesting."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was excellent! I recommended the green curry and the combo plate appetizer.   This place has only been open for 3 wks  and I think they are doing great.  Give them a try.   I only gave them 4 stars because they didn't have a full bar menu and they were working on it.  Will be back again."}
{"text":"I just drove up and you guys were closed! For now you get 1 star until you're actually open and i try your food. So mad i drove here for nothing!!! I will update when you're open and I try the food."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is so good! I'm a huge Thai fan and this is my favorite Thai restaurant in the Vegas area. I just had the Tilapia and its was amazing!"}
{"text":"So far the service was excellent and the prices were decent. I came in during my lunch break and the food was excellent and cheap. I've been coming here since before the official opening and the owners are wonderful. Only problem is that when coming with a larger group the orders do take longer than usual and mix up happens. Besides that this place is a good destination for Thai.

The food - I ordered a Spicy Seafood fried rice which was presented in a very appetizing way. Big shrimp,Big crab legs, and big muscles. The taste was really good and enjoyable. 

I will be returning."}
{"text":"Don't let the closed in exterior fool you!  I stopped in straight from the rental car terminal to pickup dinner on my way to the hotel.  Inviting interior, relaxing atmosphere and pleasant staff.  The food was fresh and flavorful.  It was even packaged to stay hot and mess free 30 minutes later.
Try Hollywood Noodle Thai Cuisine!"}
{"text":"Great food. Had the spicy noodle and the nam kow tod which was as good as what I've had at lotus of siam but zero wait."}
{"text":"I have no shame when it comes to FTR. So after only a single visit, here goes.

This spot certainly has a history of failure. It was Italian, then Greek, then Sushi. Then A Thyme For All Seasons made a decent run before they went back to just catering. I enjoyed my lunch today enough that I hope Hollywood Noodle sticks around for a little while.

I ordered the Seafood Noodle Soup. I think Thai Style Noodle House has spoiled me because I was disappointed at the size when it came out, but it turned out to be the perfect size. The menu says squid, fish balls, crabstick and white mushroom. Instead what I got was squid, fish, mussels, and shrimp. Not a complaint. Just something I realized as I write this. I thought the broth was tasty, with a subtle heat that built up, especially as I reached the bottom of the bowl.

Note: If you're no longer offering your 50% off grand opening price, take the damn sign down. They gave us a courtesy 10% off for the confusion.

More than anything, it's nice to have another lunch option in the area. Plus, they have online ordering through Eat24 (Yelp ties into it). I'll be back."}
{"text":"Best Thai place in las Vegas. Crab fried rice was made with real crayb. Thai iced tea was made with honey not sugar. Service was amazing. Nice people. Also met the cook. Yummmmmmmm"}
{"text":"I just ordered the pad Thai.  It had a fish taste to it.  I took one bite and almost threw up.  Paid full price and didn't even eat my food. Worst Thai food I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"We started off with shrimp rolls - egg rolls imbedded with an entire shrimp that were light and tasty. For entrees my wife chose Thai BBQ chicken and I the grilled sea bass in banana leaves. We also mistakenly ended up with 2 servings of rice - one being jasmine and the other a combination of jasmine, brown and red.  The BBQ chicken was juicy, but the taste fell a little flat in comparison to the sea bass.  I used a Groupon."}
{"text":"Great Thai food, I'll be back!  Don't let the exterior deter you from a very delicious meal.

Chicken satay and Thai green papaya salad were first up. The chicken satay was grilled well, but lacking in flavor without the sauce. However it was complimented with an amazing peanut sauce and cucumber side.  The papaya salad was ordered medium spicy but served hot, so just be careful. 

The jade curry was very sweet and flavorful. Rice was cooked to perfection.  Can't wait to try their other curry dishes."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a few coworkers. We left feeling impressed with both the food and the vibe the restaurant has. We ordered Pad Thai, Pineapple Curry, and Crispy Pork. All were delicious. The food took a little longer to come out and we had to rush through our hour long lunch break, however it seems like they cook your food fresh to order which could explain the time it took us to get our food. Overall we really enjoyed our experience and plan to go back."}
{"text":"Went for my first time a few days ago. Tried a curry dish and an eggplant dish, both were delicious. Waitress was very friendly also. I plan on going back."}
{"text":"Wish they didn't have a twenty five dollar minimum on delivery I tried some Tia soup on delivery I want to go into the restaurant to dine in with one of there dishes and get a better impression then update my review"}
{"text":"This was my first visit.  As I walked in, the atmosphere was very inviting with modern décor, more on the upscale side than not.  The staff was very friendly and helpful. However, they were understaffed.  There was only 2 people working the whole restaurant when I visited and there were over 40 people during that lunch hour. My dish was tasty but the other people in my party were not as impressed because they were served the wrong dish.  The waitress did discount our bill because of it though so they do try to make things right."}
