{"text":"Why can't a simple order for eggs over easy result in eggs over easy : semi-hard yokes are not that.  Once a year I re-try this place and once a year it's a fail.   Otherwise this place is fine."}
{"text":"Had the Benedict on corn bread and it was amazing ! Sucks that the place is so small it's definitely not baby or stroller friendly ! My husband had the French toast and that was unreal as well ! I would go back !"}
{"text":"Accidentally had brunch here on Sunday morning and it was great.  I was going to a near by shop which wasn't open yet and decided to have an espresso which turned into brunch and an americano.  My seat was near the front window which was fab since I was alone and it gave me lots to look at.  I had the omelet special which was sundried tomatos with goat cheese, it came with potatos and greens.  I am one of those people who loves salad with brunch, I can't help it, it just makes me feel good.  All in all the dish was delicious: light fluffy omelet, potatos with herbs and salad with a balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  The dish wasn't anything you couldn't get at a number of places but it was tastey and the location, decor and the coffee mean I would definitely go back.  Speaking of coffee, this place specializes in coffee so I should state that the coffee was spectacular!!"}
{"text":"A bit slowness but the food's quality is guaranteed. Price is also fair. The poached eggs look like clouds!!"}
{"text":"I went here last Sunday for brunch and my meal was excellent!  I had the omelette with  spinach, mushrooms & warm, gooey goat cheese - Delish! As someone who makes a point of getting her full 8 glasses in every day, I was thrilled to see that there was a lovely glass carafe full of water on every table in the restaurant.  Service was great too!  Highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"You should go there for your Sunday brunch !  Good food and good prices !  I love going there !"}
{"text":"I've passed this place so many times, and I finally made it in for brunch today. Luckily, after a gloomy morning, weather was on my side and we was able to sit in the back. It's an adorable little backyard with maybe 10 tables, if that, and umbrellas. It's quiet back there and makes you feel as though you aren't even in the city anymore. Service was quick and friendly, and we weren't left feeling rushed to leave when we finished eating. I ordered the french toast and quite enjoyed it; thick pieces of toast with a creamy (?) maple syrup.   I would definitely like to get to that patio before the weather turns too cool."}
{"text":"Didn't have food so no comment on that, but sweet holy mother of cinnamon sugar latte. Possibly the best latte I've ever had, and I've had a LOT of lattes. Definitely going back for another."}
{"text":"This place was ok - they seemed to have problems getting my order right. Also there was too much bread on my plate and the French Toast was mediocre - this restaurant is acceptable but not my favourite."}
{"text":"Best Latte in the city.    Very friendly staff and service and a gem of a little patio out back"}
{"text":"Love this little cafe. More of a coffee shop but does brunch. Space is small but cozy for groups of 4 max. Their omelets are delicious as well as the eggs benedict which they serve on corn bread. A little disappointed about the \"pancakes\", which are literally pieces of thick cake. Great service, long wait for food, fresh ingredients, small space, healthy options, bland potatoes. One brunch meal that leaves you satisfied but not holding you tummy because you're about to explode."}
{"text":"Love this place! I enjoy especially the pastries they have. You can tell by their look and their taste that they are freshly made in their kitchen :-) I had the scones with green tea and white chocolate! It was such a bless!lol The staff (1 guy!lol) is very friendly. The only thing that I regret is the space: too small, too tight! If you wanna stay make sure to get a spot nearby the window otherwise, bring your food/drink for a walk :-)"}
{"text":"We ate brunch at Niche on Sunday, March 2nd before attending a Raptors game.  I ordered the eggs benedict, my partner had the AB breakfast.  I had a cafe mocha, she had a regular coffee.  We both thought our dishes rather nice, and worthy of 4 stars.  My only comment on the eggs benedict was that it collapsed into the cornmeal bread it sat upon, and any illusion of something other than a mushy dish disappeared.  it was still good.  Her bacon was a tad underdone, she thought, but the rest of well prepared.  We both agreed this establishment fell short of 5 stars.  Still, we would go again, and recommend this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch with a buddy. The waiter was very friendly and helpful.   I had their Eggs Benedict and it was quite tasty. Instead using muffins, they served it with corn bread which I personally find to be better! One downside with the corn bread is that it falls apart very easily when you cut through it, as a result, you might end up with a messy plate full of crumbs.  Overall the experience was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Some of the best coffee in the city, if you like it strong. I buy the Little Italy for my at-home lattes. So good.  The food is simple, but everything is awesome. If you thought a tuna sandwich couldn't be exciting, try it here. Even the salad dressing is great. The eggs Benedict (over cornbread) is my absolute favorite breakfast."}
{"text":"My feelings are mixed. Historically, I've really liked it. Usually awesome coffee, good food, all reasonably priced, and a nice back patio.  Recently, however, I haven't been so convinced. I think I've just hit them on two off days lately, but once, the barista said she'd bring a drink out to the patio, then promptly forgot, having to start it once I went in about 20 minutes later to see what was up. Last time, the iced latte had this weird gray colour to it. I definitely intend to give it a try the next time I'm in the area though...hopefully it'll be back up to where it used to be."}
{"text":"Three words: Poached Eggs BLT  Absolutely amazing, the slightly spicy mayo just adds a perfect kick and the bread is unreal. I hear everything on the breakfast menu is just as delicious and the new owner also runs a catering company that delivers healthy meals.   I like the back patio, it was great to enjoy the first really warm day of the year there."}
{"text":"We were excited to visit on Labour Day Monday for a Freak Shake, but left very disappointed by everything about the cafe. We waited almost an hour for our shakes, everyone who ordered after us was served their shakes first, we had to ask for ours again and wait again.   My shake was brought as triple chocolate but it tasted like the coffee shake, didn't have the listed toppings, and I have pictures that show it was nothing like what others or this cafe posts on social media. My friend was given a different shake and the server \"apologized\" since the other table that came after us was given our order and they've run out of toppings. They modified it a bit,  but again it wasn't anything like what we see online. The \"chocolate\" shake was also very liquid and not creamy at all.   After all of that and coming extra early to avoid closing time, we were given shakes very close to closing time. Shortly after that, we were told we need to leave since the place closes soon.   From service, to product, to organization and coordination, we were disappointed on all fronts. Just wanted to let others know to avoid going all the way out there for Freak Shakes or regular visits, since it's a very poor, rude, subpar experience. I'm not sure if any owner was there that day, but hopefully they're made aware of this since it's a new business starting up and so far the opposite of impressive."}
{"text":"As long as they're not too busy (they're still figuring out how to scale up on busy days), this is one of the best kept brunch secrets in Toronto. The staff are extremely nice and accommodating--no problem with small changes or substitutions. I had the poached eggs on Rye, though I substituted eggs over easy. The bread was fresh, fluffy and flavourful, the eggs perfect, tomatoes roasted. My latte was excellent. Really, I'd say they suffer from being too humble--they are not marketing their fabulous brunch enough, so most people are coming via word of mouth (or social marketing, like this). That said, I can see from previous posts that they are still figuring out how to ramp up when they're busy. Try them out though. The back patio is fantastic."}
{"text":"The reviews stand up!  Thanks, Yelp for pulling through once again.  Niche's brunch is comforting and delicious.  I had the eggs benedict which was served on their homemade cornbread.  I would have been satisfied with just the cornbread.  It was so soft and tasty.  My boyfriend got the french toast, and dare he say, it was \"the best french toast he ever had!\".  It was so thick and moist, I couldn't help but steal a few bites.   It's a small place, so it gets a bit cramped, especially if you're sitting next to the counter which we were.  Nonetheless, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"My first ever review! I've had several places prompt me to join, but just decided to (finally) after eating here.   Called in on a Friday at 1pm to see if they serve brunch, \"Yes\", great! And plenty of seating available. Wife and I each ordered the \"ab fab\" = 2 eggs your way, bread, taters, choice of bacon or peameal, and 1/2 french toast slice with fruit and caramel sauce.   Service = Awesome, super friendly Food = Excellent, huge portions, deelish FT, great fruit Coffee = Great dbl cafe americano Fresh squeeze OJ as well  Only con: Potatoes could have been a little more cooked. Sorry guys, but had to say it. But that is it.  Reserving 5 stars for out of this world experiences, but this places was awesome. I would recommend and return happily."}
{"text":"So I dragged my boyfriend here because I kept seeing awesome pictures of the shakes they serve, and the reviews are also pretty good. I was so excited, but in the end we left severely disappointed.  When we first got there, I thought the patio area was lovely. However, our waitress did not know English. I don't mind if a staff member isn't 100% fluent, but this lady barely knew any basic English. She had no idea what fries were, and we couldn't even order a drink because she kept saying she didn't understand English.   Our food came pretty fast, but it was only so-so, and the portion size wasn't very big for the price. We also got attacked by wasps outside, and had to go back indoors where flies kept attacking our food instead. They didn't even have the shake I was looking for, and I didn't end up trying any because all of them were so overpriced.  We asked for ketchup for our potatoes but all we got was one small squirt in a big cup. We ordered steak but only got a butter knife, so it was impossible to cut. We asked the waitress, but she had no other knives, even though they're the ones who sell steak! A lot of the steak was just fat too, so we left pretty hungry.  In the end, we felt like all of this was a joke. We weren't happy at all, and even though we still tipped the waitress, she didn't even say thanks or bye. Yep, never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Finally, a good latte/coffee in Toronto!!! I'm on a quest to find a good coffee/latte and see if they exist in Toronto.  I discovered Niche one day as I walked along Queen St. West. Their expresso machine caught my eye and I couldn't resist the urge of going in and tasting their latte. It was spectactular!! Great beans, roasted perfectly giving a wonderful flavour.  The latte was perfect - perfectly poured, nice microfoam and fantastic to drink. As an added bonus, they serve fair trade coffee.  I've had 3 different baristas so obviously they are well trained because the lattes and expressos are all consistently good!! I haven't tried their breakfast, brunch, lunch but love their scones - very nice home made scones with interesting flavours. I am in love with their coffee and recommend you go!"}
{"text":"Today was my first foray into Niche. It was late in the afternoon (almost 5), I was a touch hungry and wanted to find a place to lounge with the Sunday paper.   I wandered in and saw that they had sandwiches and some desserts ready to serve as well as a pretty wide selection of drinks that offer even non-coffee and tea drinkers plenty of choice. I had a salami sandwich, an Italian soda and a sea salt brownie.   After placing my order, I gathered a few discarded and already read sections of various newspapers and made my way to the quiet back patio. The atmosphere was perfect for spending time solo as well as for enjoying company, as I was joined later on by my boyfriend.   I'll definitely be recommending this as a meet up spot next time I schedule some catch-up time with friends."}
{"text":"Average brunch spot. Decor is nice inside with a French hipster feel, but the sit down area in the back is very cramped and I literally felt like i was a part of the conversation with the customers next to us as I could hear every word in detail.   Would probably not return as the price is slightly premium for the quality of Denny's."}
{"text":"A great brunch spot! Had wonderful pancakes here with a cup of fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. Really hit the spot! Niche also has excellent French toast as my girlfriend declares it the best she's had in the city, and we've tried most!  Cute back patio at the queen west location  though it doesn't have any cover from the elements.   Overall a very nice spot with a good variety of brunch options. I'm going to give the paninis a chance next time I'm wandering through the area."}
{"text":"Very solid brunch at a reasonable price point. Service was just okay (one guy was manning the entire restaurant). They have great outdoor seating in the back...it feels nice and quaint. The French toast was amazing, and the breakfast potatoes were some of the best I've had outside of my own kitchen (super crispy on the outside and seasoned to perfection)!  I kinda want to rate this 5 stars but I guess I wasn't absolutely blown away. I try to save 5 star ratings for transcendent food experiences, but this place is better than 4 stars; it's 4.5."}
{"text":"I've been to this place 3 or 4 times now for breakfast on a Sunday. They always have a table to sit at and I've never been left waiting. It's been the same staff every time I've gone and they're both wonderful, quick and responsive and friendly.  The food is good. I've had the french toast, which I personally was not a fan of but that's my personal preference. It was too thick for me and felt too filling/heavy on the stomach. The eggs are really good, the omelette is amazing, and the regular bacon is good. Price is reasonable and average compared to any other breakfast/brunch place.  Their coffee is pretty good (definitely better than Starbucks, Second Cup, Tim Hortons and McDonalds). Their espresso is also good. A little pricey but for a one time kind of thing it's worth it.  I definitely plan to go here often."}
{"text":"Get there French toast. My boyfriend got it and I was jealous. Seriously, it was so delicious. When I come back I won't make the same mistake. (Not that my meal was bad in any way at all but the french toast just really stood out.) It's also really nice that everything comes with fresh fruits."}
{"text":"I met up with a friend for brunch this past weekend and we decided to check out Niche.  We found a seat in their back patio, which was very cute!  My friend and I ended up sharing a picnic bench with another group.  I love the communal feel of this place.  On to the food - we started off with an americano and cappuccino, our caffeinated drinks were great!  Their all day brunch menu was next, we both ordered the 3 egg omelettes and shared a side of peameal bacon.  Our omelettes were very good, and were complemented well with the side of greens and roasted potatoes.  The bacon was delish!  I would highly recommend this place for a brunch spot in the Queen and Bathurst area.  Their coffee is not bad either!"}
{"text":"Went here for Brunch on a Sunday with a girlfriend. Cute atmosphere. Had the Niche Benedict with Smoked Salmon. Loved that it was served on corn bread, made it different and stand out. Everything was fresh and delicious. Also ordered the white chocolate mocha! Fantastic. Not too sweet and sugary like you'd get at one of those chain coffee shops. I'll definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Love the look and feel of the place.  Only stopped in for a coffee so my overall experience was brief.  Ordered a soy, vanilla latte which I enjoyed very much.  Hot, not too much foam and not too sweet.  Service was prompt and friendly.  Several groups were here for brunch.  Would love to come back and lounge on their back patio with a good book and coffee.  The only disappointment was that I was looking forward to grabbing a croissant on the go but they only had cookies.  It's possible though that it was due to the time of day as it was almost 12pm."}
{"text":"This is a great little all day brunch cafe place.  I had the Eggs Benedict, which wasn't that good.  The pouched egg was a tad overdone, the corn bread was dry and the hollandaise sauce was plain.  Perhaps it was just a bad batch, but I would not order it again.  My date had the deep pan french toast which was OUTSTANDING.   It had the thickest bread I've ever seen used to make french toast before, the sides of fruits and help balance the dish well along with the semi sweet syrup they used.  Get the french toast, you can't go wrong with it!   The patio out back is nice to hang out at and the umbrella shade is welcome on hot days."}
{"text":"My wife and I were their first customers on a Sunday morning. Service was great, staff was very friendly and the food was pretty good. Usually when I walk in a restaurant Im not familiar with  tell the waiter/waitress whats their best selling dish. My wife and I ordered the French Toast, the three eggs and eggs Benedict. All three were great. The French toast might actually be the best Ive ever had.  Cant wait to go there again.  They also have amazing homemade ketchup. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the Benedict eggs through foodora and the eggs were not even poached! What kind of brunch place doesn't know how to poach eggs?"}
{"text":"Apparently this place change management twice since I last came. No longer is the amazing french toast on the menu.  *sadface*  The changes are huge as the service is terrible. The girl behind the counter doesn't care no more and keep texting on her phone.  Never did they bring us water to our table.  The menu is totally new but have like 1/4 of their items already stratched off.  Niche is going downhill and doesn't look like they will be able to revover from this.  Their Niche breakfast was bland and on the smaller end.  I did like the waffle BLT which was very good value and tasted pretty good. That is the only thing I saw was positive here. Don't think I will come back anymore.  RIP Amazing French Toast......"}
{"text":"A wonderful coffee spot, narrow and cozy, yet bright and modern at the same time, just thinking about Niche Coffee makes me want to go back for more of their great tasting java in gorgeous large cups. The breakfast was perfect too. I had the super popular eggs benny with the sweet corn bread and topped with that perfect spring green colour that can only be reflected by arugula, and guaranteed to put a smile on your face. I commented to the server that I couldn't remember having eggs benny with peameal bacon that could be cut with a fork, tender and getting along nicely with the eggs and crumbly corn bread. Can't wait to come back for their French toast!"}
{"text":"Totally underwhelming breakfast. I ordered a BLT and side of fries. BLT with cheese had few ingredients on it - two small pieces of bacon and barely any cheese really disappointing for 7$. Home fries on the side were totally undercooked and inedible. How can you mess up home fries?!!  Cmon people!  Fresh OJ was good."}
{"text":"A big 'meh' from me and my brunch companion would be even less complimentary. They must save the A crew for the weekend because Thursday morning opens late, makes you wait 30 minutes for the kitchen to open, another 30 minutes for runny eggs with an incomplete order. They only have a few weekday breakfast items; how can the cook be forgetful about what goes on the plate? And the famous challah French toast was completely unmemorable, save for the sort of interesting syrup.  My breakfast was ok but I have to acknowledge the shudder-inducing bathroom. Despite the yelp checkin bonus that entitles me to a $3 double americano, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Tried to go here once for a quick solo breakfast. After announcing to the entire place that I was dining alone (never mortifying, right?) the server proceeded to seat me and leave me to rot. Someone eventually brought water but after fifteen minutes I had to find another place to eat before I starved to death. She didn't even apologize as she stood behind the bar doing nothing but watch me leaving. Since I didn't eat here I feel weird giving out stars. One for decor, I guess? And one more for the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"This is the perfect little spot for a weekend breakfast outing. We trickled in early Friday morning (before the rush of the late-wakers) and took advantage of their calm and cool atmosphere.  I would re-visit for the service alone as she was very kind, personable and attentive. Regarding the food, I always get excited when I see menus printed on regular paper. It confirms that there are creative and innovative thinkers behind that open counter and they're looking to share their culinary passion with us.  Their menu is small, but well thought out; something for everyone. My friend and I both ordered an egg dish, but the French toast was clearly the hot item (three orders delivered while we were there).  If I were to make one criticism, it would be that the food took quite a while to arrive. We were one of the only tables in there (table of 4 before us) and it took a substantial amount of time to receive our dishes. Granted, I was starving, so perhaps each minute felt like 5. Also, when our dishes were presented to us, we were both blown away by the presentation. They clearly put a lot of time into presenting both an appetizing and a visually appealing dish, and that we appreciate.  Overall I recommend this hot spot and would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"This place caught my eye while walking down Queen St.  It's hard to ignore a sign outside advertising eggs benny and bacon and eggs mid afternoon.  Decided to circle back to give it a shot for a very late Sunday brunch.  The restaurant is set up like a coffee shop with a large counter/bar in the middle.  You get a bit confused when you walk in and I wasn't sure whether I'd be seated or to order from the bar (you seat yourself).  We elected on the seat by the open window in the dining area, which was a nice spot to relax and people watch.  There were two people working aside from the cook and although very friendly, they appeared a bit flustered even though there were only a handful of people eating.  I had the ab-fab and my friend ordered the eggs benedict.  They had run out of cornbread so she substituted it with rye.  The bread and french toast on my ab-fab was delicious.  I'd return for the french toast alone.  The bread was thick and lightly toasted - Coffee was good too.  I found the eggs, bacon and home fries to be very average.  The potatoes were undercooked and although I got one extra piece of peameal bacon, it tasted a bit bland for some reason.  My friend said her eggs benny lacked enough hollandaise sauce but was otherwise OK.  For the price, it's still pretty worthwhile (Ab-fab is $16 and comes with a 12oz drink of your choice).  I'd come back with a friend or two for a reliable decent brunch spot on the patio."}
{"text":"Really nice place. We came in around 3:45 or so and ordered a La Bomba shake. It took a while to come out, but it tasted great. It seemed like the restaurant was in the process of closing up, so I didn't feel very looked after as opposed to someone who would have come in during prime time. One person walked in while the worker behind the counter swept up broken glass and never acknowledged his presence. He walked out. So I suggest coming in during prime time hours!"}
{"text":"So sad to report that I found Niche rather disappointing!   To sum up: - poor service - good french toast - mediocre eggs benedict that lacked hollandaise sauce - a peculiar idea of \"sweet potato fries\"  I went for Sunday brunch and found the space to be pleasant and quaint. After ordering (french toast, Niche benedict, sweet potato fries), I was unprepared for the rather long wait... but I can accept long waits for exceptional food!   My dining partner ordered the deep dish french toast and declared it to be very delicious. I tried some and liked it as well - it has a different texture from the usual french toast and (as the name would imply) is very thick-cut. It is moist, fluffy and all-around pretty good french toast. It also reminded me slightly of bread pudding.   The Niche benedict had the potential to be so good. It certainly looked good. A poached egg with bacon, on top of cornbread instead of the traditional English muffin, with Hollandaise sauce and arugula on top. The cornbread was tasty but a bit too crumbly - I ended up just stirring it into the egg yolk to make it easier to eat. I couldn't tell you how the Hollandaise sauce tasted as there was barely any of it. There's nothing wrong with having egg and cornbread... except that I ordered eggs benedict with Hollandaise.   The sweet potato \"fries\" were a complete joke. I'm not sure how the waiter was able to keep a straight face as he handed me the plate and repeated they were \"sweet potato fries.\" They were more like boiled sweet potatoes, cut into chunks and slathered with oil. I searched and searched for a crispy edge or something dry - anything!   I found the most annoying part to be when we mentioned the unusual fries to the waitress and how we didn't like them, she responded by laughing it off and bringing us the bill. Awesome. Thanks for your service!"}
{"text":"Breakfast here was one of the highlights of an already awesome couple of days in Toronto. I can imagine it would get really crowded on weekends, but at 10 am on a Wednesday morning, my friend an I were just about the only people in the place. We sat on the glorious back patio. My friend enjoyed a hot tea with milk & a Niche Omelet, and I had a double latte & Poached BLT. The espresso was delightful--toasty and smooth, not bitter at all. The eggs were perfect, and the spring greens on top and the fruit garnish added a really nice freshness to breakfast.  The service was not what I would call slow, but perhaps a little...relaxed. But we were relaxed, and in no hurry. I don't know whether the service would have been more hurried if we had indicated that is what we wanted, but it wasn't. So there you go.  I feel like I shouldn't give this place five stars because I can imagine it would get so chaotic in busy times. But when I was there it wasn't, and it was one of the best parts of my trip. And the food and coffee was so freaking good. So five stars it is.  I wasn't in Toronto with a Celiac, but my usual travel partner eats gluten free and I took note that they had some gluten free pastries for sale."}
{"text":"I love the brunch here! If you want a quick bite on the weekend that's not hugely portioned but great tasting, Niche is the place. The Peameal Bagel and Egg Sandwich is great and the Banana Bread w/Nutella is to die for! the coffee is good and the service is nice as well. :)"}
{"text":"From beginning to end, I had a great experience.   What I ordered:  1 Regular Latte - AMAZING! So delicious and frothy. Obvs. complete with latte art! French Toast - DELISH! Very filling, so make sure you are hungry before ordering this (I wasn't and it was a bit of a struggle to finish).   Service was friendly, funny and fast(ish). A perfect little place in Queen West for a brunch date with yourself :)   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Bad food and poor service. Ate here for brunch. Ordered a milkshake and two benedicts. The milkshake never came and waitress never showed any indications that she was going to try and get it made after we asked about where it was. How long does it take to make a milkshake?? We were there for over an hour.. The benedict came out with cold hollandaise sauce on it and the avocado that I added to it was still rock hard. I requested my eggs scrambled, and they appeared to be yolkless egg whites that probably came from a carton? The cornbread was good atleast. The waitress never refilled our waters or checked to ask how the food was so I couldn't send back my meal. When we complained and asked where the milkshake was after we finished eating the waitress said she would get a manager, but she never did. Finally we went to the counter to pay and the manager voided the avocado (which they were going to try and charge $2.50 for despite it saying $1.50 on the menu) and the milkshake and gave us a 10% discount. I have eaten out at many restaurants and was very surprised that they didn't just give us the benedict for free.. she ended up giving us a bit of a deeper discount but still not typical of any nice restaurant I've been to. We saw another table have issues with their food beside us and another table walk out before their food since it took so long."}
{"text":"Vegan Arepa was tasty but a bit pricey for size with no side for brunch. Coffee was good.  Service was lackluster and inattentive considering number of patrons.  Perhaps better as a \" to go\" joint as earning tips doesn't seem a priority."}
{"text":"We ordered dark roast coffee, hot chocolate and cookies.  The coffee was sub par, the hot chocolate was just steamed milk with miniscule cocoa powder.  The cookie was good.   This is a hipster joint and it wasnt worth any of it.   However, i saw a kitchen in the back and it seemed they may be whipping up something good but as for the cafe portion, not a fan."}
{"text":"The menu looks great but the very slow service and lack of staff made the food less than desirable. Waited nearly an hour for our food. The Niché Benedict I ordered was not good. The corn bread that replaced the english muffin on a regular benedict was tasteless and dry - it also didn't compliment the poached eggs. The poached egg were cooked perfectly but they really messed up the hollandaise sauce. The lemonade I ordered was the only thing that was good. Overall experience is bad but would come back to see why everyone else is raving about this place. Maybe weekday dinner will be better."}
{"text":"The service here is incredible, this is a very welcoming coffee shop.   I highly recommend the exotica tea!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I ordered \"La Bomba\" (one of their freakshakes) and it was GREAT. I would definitely come back again to try a different shake."}
{"text":"the best part about this place is the back patio. Absolutely gorgeous and relaxing--you forget you're just steps away from Queen West. Very good brunch, and pretty reasonably priced. Beautiful presentation and a very generously large coffee cup, which made my morning. The service is a bit on the slow side, but on a Sunday morning, I'd rather have to wait a bit for my food than feel like they're rushing me in order to seat the next person. My friend and I had a lovely, lazy, relaxed morning at Niche."}
{"text":"Some folks are sweet brunch people. Others are savoury brunch people. I am, without a doubt, a member of the latter camp.  I've got nothing at all against pancakes, french toast or muffins but it's just really hard for me to turn down options like burgers, goat cheese grits, chilaquiles, or leftover pizza when I've got the option. One glance at Niche's menu and I knew I was getting the sunny eggs with chili (con carne).  This dish was well thought-out: crispy tortilla, nicely dressed greens, fresh eggs. But the chili was a tad too sweet for my liking. Remember, I'm a savoury brunch person! A few dabs of hot sauce made it better but I really wanted more depth of flavor.  Niche has a lot going for it but above anything else, there was no wait on a Saturday morning. Wish I could say they same for you, Le Petit Dejeuner!"}
{"text":"First visit to Niche today.  Good food, fantastic coffee and good service.  The french toast was fantastic.  Worth a vist for sure"}
{"text":"THE BEST WHITE CHOCOLATE LATTE EVER.. oh and the french toast was absolutely perfect.. made with challah, soft and moist.. syrup wasn't too sweet, perfectly caramelized..  def will go back..:) NOTE, they close monday..."}
{"text":"A modern looking cafe with a lovely back patio. Coffee prices are regular and the coffee is OK but the outdoor space on its own is worth visiting. They have table service and a menu of delicious sounding brunch and lunch, although somewhat pricier that I would like ($16 for 2 eggs, bacon & french toast). That said the food does look scrumptious. A note on the bathrooms: they are not the cleanest/best-looking but they do the trick. The key is the PATIO! Great summer hang-out spot."}
{"text":"Niche Coffee & Tea Shop is squeezed amongst many other shops and restaurants in the heart of the Queen West district.  What most people do not realize is that they have a sit down breakfast, Brunch and Dinner service.  Myself & my guest were happy to arrive during the Brunch hour. Surprisingly it was not that busy upon our arrival, but by the end there was definitely a full house. The special was fresh blueberry pancakes, but I opted for the Sunny Eggs over Chili Con Carne. What a great choice it was! The chili not too hot (but a side of hot sauce for my guest did the trick) and a small side of salad with house vinaigrette.  Add a americano and a water, and the warmth of my meal made me feel more than satisfied on the \"chilly\" yet beautiful sunny day.  Our service was good, and the food was delivered quickly.  They might want to reload their tea selection, as they did not have in stock my guests first two choices.  I look forward to another quaint , food for the soul Brunch at Niche!"}
{"text":"I went back a couple of times at Niche, the food is still as good as I remember and their coffee selection as well. Although their service had been disappointing for me. I usually like ordering their soup of the day but they also bring my soup at the very last end when I'm usually done with my breakfast and coffee drink. This had happened to me a couple of times."}
{"text":"This is my all time favourite brunch place in the city.   The food is absolutely scrumptious. The eggs benedict are wonderful, as is the chilli and egg dish and the blueberry pancakes are a sweet plate of heaven.  They also serve breakfast and all day fare but brunch is the meal to have here. The patio out back is a beautiful oasis and a great place to sit around on a lazy Sunday.    Niche is first and foremost a coffee and tea house and their coffee is by far the best coffee I've ever tasted. The food is moderately priced and the service is always fast and friendly.   If you're looking for a hidden brunch gem in the city, this is it!  Also, see if you can get past the cash without salivating over their delicious home baked desserts."}
{"text":"Pretty solidly a 4.5. I'm easily impressed when a place can satisfy my desire for the lazy Sunday brunch. Only a few elements are required - a no hassle tranquil seating arrangement, excellent well constructed brunch plates and service with a comforting smile but efficient.  Niche does it exceptionally well on all aspects. Strolled in around 1PM, no packed crowds, just a few regulars and walk-ins. Luckily grabbed the table dead center in the serene back patio on a gorgeous sunny afternoon.  Our server approaches with a smile and highlights a few menu items and gets the drink order. Great start. Why can't places do this right?  The food is great, the perfect BLT, open-faced with two poached eggs...perfectly runny in the center, crisp bacon - not soggy not burnt, fresh greens. Even Gordon Ramsay wouldn't curse this kinda of quality.  A couple flavourful lattes and a tasty grilled banana bread with chocolate spread and I'm ready to call it a Sunday afternoon done right.  Maybe I'm shooting myself in the foot because the scene is kinda ruined once the crowds start to flock here, but this place deserves recognition."}
{"text":"If I can give a 0, this place would definitely deserve it. Went in there for brunch on Saturday morning and it took them so long to get us just coffee. With that, the waiter didn't ask if we wanted cream, milk, or sugar so I had to reach behind the bar myself to go get it (he was just talking casually at the bar!). While I was doing this, 3 people left because they got fed up with the service.. yup... and to top this all off.. the cream CURDLED. We could not take it anymore and left like the others. Absolutely absurd. I now have a lot of discontent/anxiety from trying any insta-hyped restaurants."}
{"text":"We came across this little place one Saturday morning trying to find some place to eat.  If it wasn't for the fact that it was one of the only non-franchised spots open, we would have missed this gem.  Food is great.  Staff is great.  The poached BLT is awesome.  And their tables are made from reclaimed bowling alley floors.  Come early.  Heard that the locals are very fond of the place and they get slammed with tons of people often."}
{"text":"I'm rating my experience at niche based in the LATTE I had... Not the food. The space is a little packed and you are quite intimate with the table next to you but my friend and I managed to get one of the last rules before a mad rush came in. I really wanted to try the cafe con leche but they were apparently out of the cinnamon syrup so I settled for a caramel latte instead. Asking for 1percent milk...because I felt like upgrading for skim, the waitress just suggested she mix non fat and two percent together. Not many people would even suggest that so I appreciated it.  The caramel latte came in a glass, but with a paper hugger that also applied as a coupon for a local theatre...back to the drink. The caramel was decorated like a flower-like web and looked very creamy with the foam nicely topped up. Since it was in a glass and not a mug, I was afraid that the drink was not going to be hot enough and I'm definitely a heat snob. To my surprise the temperature was just the right amount of hotness top drink.  The drink was sweet, I might say that a tad too sweet but on this day it was soooo delicious. The drink was dreamy, really, and for a 12 ounce cup, it never seemed to end (thank goodness or I might have had to get another one).  Definitely made my morning as I got to catch up with one of my bestests.. it was great.  Although I can't speak for the food, but looking over at the other tables.. it looked... OK. the baked goods in the front looked tasty though, and the people working there were super friendly so that's a bonus. Maybe I'll come back and get a coffee or pastry to go. Seems like they have some sort of a Tuesday deal :)"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with a friend on a late August morning.  The food here is really good (4 stars). I got the Benedict which was great (although a little surprised it didn't come with a side of anything) and the Arepa my friend for was good too (although the arepa was burnt on one side!)   Ambiance: 3.5, they have a lovely patio in the back.  Service: 1 star... Pretty ridiculous. We had to flag someone to take our orders which they did reluctantly. Our food took forever to come and paying was painful. We went up to pay because we got tired of waiting and even that took 5 minutes.  Price point: given the portion size and that the food didn't even have some greens as a side it was a little much for what you got but the food is good so it was okay."}
{"text":"The coffee here is amazing.  It's one of those cups of coffee you can taste before you've had your first sip. mmmm ... coffee.   It's also independently owned & operated, which makes me feel good about every cup of coffee I purchase.  The owner, Amanda, can be found here almost every single day, working her bum off, ensuring a smoothly run cafe.  The front window is my favourite place, and during the nicer weather, they open up the front windows, which give you a sense of outdoors, even when you're not.   They also have a back patio, which is just starting to become popular, now that the weather is getting warmer - so if you're a smoker, head on back, and enjoy the quiet space set up so you can enjoy your cig & coffee.   It's definitely of those cute little (quiet) cafe's you can spend hours at, just watching the traffic go by on Queen St. and enjoying a lovely cup of java."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been back here- maybe a year? But Niche still tops my list of breakfast/brunch places in downtown Toronto.  It's small, it's quaint. There isn't a whole lot of seating. Most pple probably don't know about it, since it's not a big brand label (i.e eggspectations, Cora's). But it's small boutique feel is part of its appeal. And despite the lack of seating, I somehow always snatch the last table.  Moreover, Niche's home-made style breakfasts are consistently AMAZING.   I ordered French toast & my friend ordered a three-egg omelette with salad and potatoes on the side.    Niche's French toast is a house specialty - a recipe that calls for banana toast with burnt sugar & syrup. Tasty, but not sickening sweet & goes perfect with coffee.  I tasted my friend's omelette, which he chose to stuff with goat cheese & red pepper.  The goat cheese melted in my mouth.  The omelette was perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of ingredients.  I walked away full, but not stuffed, which is  generally a good feeling to start the day off right."}
{"text":"Niche is one of those places that are stuck halfway to being a truly hipster brunch place. The sign looks dated and the inside is nothing to write home about. It's squished during lunch, especially if you're at the back. Nonetheless, you come for the food.  I tried the regular breakfast and the BLT benny. Both were not bad. The best part was the potatoes which had a hint of lemon and herbs. The greens are average and drenched in the vinaigrette. Unfortunately, the eggs benny were definitely overcooked as it was completely solid when cut through. Thinking this was just mine, the person who was beside us got the same dish and it looked the same way. Not sure if that's how they regularly do it, but if it is, they should call it something else.  Overall, this place is not amazing, but due to the lower prices ($9-11) compared to the typical brunch restos, it's somewhere to go only if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Yelp steered me right yet again!  Needed some brunch goodness and found out Niche filled the niche.  Came here and my buddy and I both got the french toast.  I'd say it was some of the best french toast I've ever had, with a huge amount of fruit on top to boot.  My friend liked it but held back from raving about it for some reason.  Had a cinnamon latte as well as really enjoyed the unique flavor.  Service left a little bit to be desired, but it was a cute little joint so I won't hold it again them.  The food came out quick, at least."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered two of their 'freakshakes' about an hour before closing time. We ended up waiting over half an hour (they said the kitchen was backed up though it was just us and one group of people at the time), and then we both got the wrong orders. (I think two other people who came in after us got our shakes by accident, but can't confirm that.) We told them the shakes were wrong and they fixed it, and even offered a free slice of cake for the trouble. But by the time we got the right shakes, we had about five minutes to drink them quickly because they were closing up. Also, the shake I ended up getting was more milk than ice cream and seemed to be missing some of the ingredients listed on the menu--definitely not worth the trouble."}
{"text":"The name has changed to Nuna.  New management and new brief menu.  Perhaps because new and adjusting? I may check again in a month or so to see if there are further changes."}
{"text":"Great spot for a nice brunch and coffee. We had:  Eggs Benedict Poached BLT Cappuccino  Sweet potato wedges  Everything was delicious and there was nothing left on either of our plates. Not a crowded place so it was nice for a relaxing Sunday brunch"}
{"text":"I'm a brunch person.  I just moved to the city and I wanted somewhere where my friends and I could meet every Sunday and have a good cup of coffee and relax.  My bf and I finally got to try this place on the weekend...found thanks to yelp.  He hates coffee but loves Tea and I was excited when I found out they had so many varieties to choose from.  In addition to that factor...my bf is a chef so it is nearly impossible to really please him.  He had salmon eggs benedict and when I questioned \"How is it?\" I simply received a \"hmraweowf\"  which was \"Its good\" with a happy mouth full of food.  I couldn't decide what to have and had the Ab Fab...basically a bit of everything.  All of it was delicious!  The place was very busy and we did have to wait.  The two staff in there also did seem quite overrun, we often had to wait for missing milk or something, but to be honest, I wanted to relax and enjoy breakfast and I wouldve hated to have been rushed out of there.  The food was totally worth it!  We will be regulars for sure."}
{"text":"i hesitated writing this review because i don't want this gem of a spot to get overrun during Sunday Brunch. however, it is just so great i can't help but rave. i visited Niche after a friend demanded french toast for brunch and we stumbled upon Niche. right from the beginning i fell in love with this place. from the french-victorian decor to the super warm welcome and banter when i entered i knew Niche had the right vibe. despite the small number of seats my friend and i didn't have to wait. before our food we both got Americano's and, unlike most brunch/breakfast joints, were actually able to ENJOY the coffee. immediately i knew that if the food was even as good as the coffee i had found my place. she ordered the deep-dish brunch and i, for the first time, was able to order sweet potato wedges with my 3-egg omelette ( perfect if you are a vegetarian and paleo enthusiast like me). the dishes were delicious. my omelette was flavourful, fluffy, and huge. i got to try some of the french toast and was in heaven. it was soaked with batter throughout, nicely grilled on the outside, and covered in a delicious syrup. i will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is siiiick!! Ill keep this as simple as a dimple!!   Went in on a sunday moorning!!! 1.coffee GREAT( obvi, cuz i loves coffee)  2.service is cool cuz its small and the dudes keep it real 3. Food awesome ( i asked for 2egg omelet instead of 3 cuz its too much egg for me so the guy hooked me up with a mountain of greens wish made my morning)   So Go just go and you will love   OH and the french toast MMMMMMM....."}
{"text":"I called ahead (around 8:30 am) to ask if they had any vegan breakfast items. The woman on the phone was very polite and said they had a vegan sandwich with roasted veggies. I reconfirmed that there were no animal products on the sandwich and she said no.    At around 9:15, on my way to work, I stopped by and ordered a tea and the sandwich. Again I asked if it was vegan and the man said it was. The service was very slow, it seemed understaffed.   About 15 minutes later I recieved my sandwich and it had white stuff on it. I asked the cashier what it was and he said it had mayo on it. I asked if I could have another one because I had specified I wanted it vegan. The cook then came out and yelled at me: \"there is no white stuff, there is no mayo, it's goat cheese and it says it on the menu!\" and when the cashier asked if he could make another one he continued to yell \"it'll be another 25 minutes!\"   A very unpleasant experience. I wish that the communication was more polite. I know that vegan ism isn't always easy to accommodate but I expected more since I had called ahead and tried to communicate as clearly as possible."}
{"text":"Went there for the French toast everyone's been raving about...what we got tasted 2 days old & definitely was not fresh. Staff were nice, but nothing was too special about this place."}
{"text":"It was only a short 4 days since I'd moved south to Queen West and I was faced with an ever-daunting dilemma: where to have brunch when a friend visits??  I had my Annex haunts down pat, but had no clue what was good, what was bad, and what was ugly in my new 'hood.  Armed to find something delicious, my friend and I set out westward on Queen, checking out the menus and came across Niche.  Being a little hung-over and crazy hungry, it fulfilled the requirements we were looking for: coffee (yes), food (yes), egg-free options (I don't like eggs, which can make breakfast out a challenge sometimes).  Sounds good!    THE GOOD - The food.  I am now addicted to their bagel with cream cheese and lox!!  It's delicious, and I feel fresh and slightly healthy after I finish it :)   - The coffee and espresso bevs.  Their macchiato made my week.  I've gone back a number of times and may risk heat stroke with this weather and a hot drink.   - The atmosphere.  Very relaxed, lovely decor.  Last time I was there, I ate on the patio; lovely.   - The prices.  Reasonable!!!!  And so worth what you get.   THE BAD  - The service can be interesting.  There is more than just one person anytime I've been in, who's extremely nice, but I've on more than one occasion wondered if he's smoked up a little bit before making my drink.  Also, the first time I ate here, we were served initially by a woman who seemed surprised we wanted to order.  No, we're just going to loiter.  Also, they're always sparse with the water.  I like to be hydrated, especially in this heat.   Overall, this is now my new favourite brunch spot in the 'hood.  Yes, I'm on a mission to find more, but this one will akin to my old love for Insomnia."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible food if your order it out! They shoved my entire meal into a small take out container that could hold no more then a muffin... This place is a sad place if they think they can serve food like this... Awful and ontop of it you cannot get the restaurant on the phone..."}
{"text":"As several other reviewers recommended it, I tried the Niche Eggs Benedict, and it did not disappoint!  The cornbread is a great addition to this dish and served as an excellent tool to sop up all the eggy goodness.    I coupled it with a fresh squeezed orange juice and it ran me about $16.  I had no trouble getting seated right away, and the servers were polite and gave me some pointers for places to shop nearby."}
{"text":"love the french toast! highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place was so adorable!! You wouldn't think much of it when you walk in through the front but once you're in the back patio it's adorable!! The service was super friendly, maybe could've been a little quicker but the politeness and friendliness of the staff makes up for it. And the food is DE-LI-CIOUS!!! Had the benny with sweet potatoes...so good!!"}
{"text":"Came here during the summer after seeing all the hype about the milkshakes. We ordered a total of three milkshakes. It took a while to make but it wasn't too long. The flavour of the milkshakes were pretty good but half of the cup was pretty much foam. There was not enough milkshake.   Price wise not that worth it for half a cup of milkshake."}
{"text":"Good \"Poached BLT\".   Really, really nice servers.   Nice back patio.  Good latte."}
{"text":"I'm surprised anyone eats here. It may be a good place for coffee and snacks. We came here for brunch because Lisa Marie had a lineup. The service was slow and spotty. My eggs were poached rock hard and arrived cold even though I asked for medium. They did not yet have the cornbread ready at 11:30 on a holiday weekend. I would stay away."}
{"text":"Latte Tuesday to my surprise = cookie and a vanilla latte for under $5.   The milk is way too hot but the latte was better than Starbucks. They do sea salt chocolate chip cookies here, which appears to be the trend nowadays. Good thing.  No wifi. All day breakfast and lunch (sandwiches) menu. Loose leaf tea.  Pretty good spot to check out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"The man candy behind the counter was what brought me inside on such a wonderful and sunny day! The staff is very lovely to talk to and to look at. I ordered the masala chai tea, which was quite subtle and not as strong as I thought it would be.  The place itself did need a bit of dusting and cleaning. I sat near the window and the table beside me had a dirty plate. This remained there throughout my entire time, although the coffee guy came by several times to serve the other table near the window!  I am certain the food is delicious and the different coffees are well made, but they need to keep their tables clean. They are very handsome clean men, they can shift that cleanliness habit to their tables."}
{"text":"Big dip in quality of service and food.   We weren't greeted, sat ourselves and were about to put on our coats to leave when we got a menu. I can understand they were busy but they can seriously look at us with their eyes and say with their mouths \"Hey, have a seat. I'll be with you as quick as possible\" while their hands and legs are busy.  Ordered an Ab-Fab again and the plate was missing our french toast. It was sent out separately, which would've been fine if the tables were big enough to accommodate it all. The potato serving was like 1/4 cup and not crispy, mostly mushy.  I don't even get why service was so slow and disorganized. Didn't feel the love this time :("}
{"text":"this place has a huge selection of teas and coffees, friendly & quick service. I ordered the eggs benny with smoke salmon. the dish was pretty good but the hollandaise sauce was just meh. could have used a bit more and it was kinda thick and dry. i really enjoyed my espresso though . place is small and intimate and not recommended for big groups."}
{"text":"I tried one of their pastries and at $6, I didn't feel the quality warrant that pricepoint. It's a nice little cafe to hang out and people watch. My friend ordered a chai latte and the barista had to ask her what to put in it. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Haven't had a single bad experience at Niche! Lovely staff and service, and amazing food! Highly recomend the french toast, its the best I have ever had in my life."}
{"text":"Was in urgent need of a coffee and Niche came through. Their cappuccino is very good! Skip Sbux and head here for your fix. Seating is limited, the window nook is the best seat in the house to people watch. :)"}
{"text":"Great location for brunch. The food is fantastic, especially the corn bread. The service staff could be a bit friendlier and the men's bathroom door doesn't lock properly. But other than that, it's definitely worth checking out. :)"}
{"text":"Did you know about Niche's incredible back patio? It almost (almost) gets me to unhate wicker furniture, which is saying a lot. The terrace is interlocked brick and the furniture is a healthy mix of metal and weaved seating. There are lots of different kinds of seating too: bistro sets, tables for four, a few benches around an iron coffee table and a monstrous glass-topped picnic table underneath a sprawling umbrella.   Did I also mention the huge slabs of limestone in the fence? Or the perfectly pyramidical topiary beside a FOUNTAIN? I shouldn't have to. It's an amazing spot.  Oh, so they do a solid all day breakfast here. I'd recommend the eggs benedict, and their coffee is quite excellent. The interior of the cafe is nothing special, so I would \"make hay while the sun shines\" and check out their patio post-haste.  Obligatory Title Pun: A respectable RECESS.  Menu Readability: They use a really nice old-timey typeface.  Need to mention: No Wi-Fi!  What this place teaches me about myself: Isn't it weird when people put idioms in quotes? It's \"ever so strange.\""}
{"text":"Came here for the crazy milkshakes. They have a outdoor balcony in the back.   The order took a while but the milkshakes were pretty good, average. Nothing too special. Problem was there was too much foam in them."}
{"text":"Not as good as I was hoping for.   The set up of this coffee shop feels more like a small restaurant rather than a coffee shop. It is rather narrow with small tables along the side with a few tables in the front and back. Didn't see the back patio because it was raining when I came. The atmosphere also feels kind of mainstream, so if you are looking for any kind of counter culture vibe, you won't be getting it here.   I ended up ordering one of their holiday drinks called The Peppy which is a peppermint mocha topped with whipped cream. While it was drinkable, I definitely was not impressed. I can't comment on their brunch menu because I didn't come for brunch.  They do have free wi-fi here though, which is nice, but make sure you ask for the password at the counter when you place your order.  I can't see any reason to seek this place out, and think of it as a rather average option if you are already in the area."}
{"text":"Good food. Did not open on time specified on the website though."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Niche for brunch when another nearby resto was clogged up with long lines that weren't worth the wait, and I'm glad that I did, because my meal was amazing!!  I had a delicious eggs benedict (I'm going to have to start documenting my experiences with eggs benny at every brunch establishment I visit just to keep track!) and wonderful cup of tea. The decor is lovely and simple and I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Picked this as our brunch spot yesterday after walking by it many times. The staff is very welcoming, friendly and helpful. I asked for a tea recommendation and was told to try the exotic green tea which is my new favourite (green tea, coconut and pineapple).   For my meal I ordered the Niche Breakfast: 2 eggs, 3 slices of bacon, roasted potatoes, salad, toast and fruit. We will definitely be returning and recommend you try it if you are in the area. They also have a neat patio in the back."}
{"text":"Most importantly - the food was great.  They have a special version of Eggs Benedict called Niche Benedict which was truly outrageous.  Poached eggs on bacon on corn bread, topped with arugula.  Really great.  And brunch all day!  Why don't more places offer this?!  The staff is also very friendly, and the place has a cool DIY vibe.    Would have rated a solid four stars were it not for some shoddy service, though I think that was a particular problem of the table where I was sitting - sort of out of the line of sight of the service station.  I have a feeling it would not be a problem elsewhere."}
