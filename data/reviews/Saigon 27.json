{"text":"I visited the restaurant with a Groupon deal they had and I had a pleasant meal.  The meal was prix fixe - appetizer, main, dessert, and there were no price restrictions on which ones we could choose.  I generally liked all the foods that we ordered because they were quite tasty and well cooked. The visual presentation was also neat and appetizing as well as the aromas.  Though the food was great, the service and the atmosphere wasn't as on par. Service was rather slow - the waitress/server only came by pretty much to serve us our food but not to check up on us, and since we were on the balcony, it was hard to flag down a server.  The restaurant itself seemed a little outdated, and the tables and chairs seemed a little sticky in spots from not being cleaned properly.  I'd go back for the food but the other aspects of the restaurant keeps me from going!"}
{"text":"Service wasn't good. I got the prix fixe. The soup was good, the tai roll wasn't bad, but was borderline over cooked. The crispy chicken was over cooked (burnt). The creme brûlée was perhaps the worse thing I ever ate. The place was filthy. My water glass had lipstick on it. Overall pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Can only give this place 2-3 stars - maybe because i've lived in Vancouver, BC and San Jose CA, both of which have 5* thai/vietnamese for very little money. This place felt like it had the Fisherman's wharf (SFO) phenomenon -- why bother since most people will be tourists who don't do return business.  Food was ok, kinda skimpy portions for the price. Service was very slow as others mentioned, and the place was looking quite run down -- which I don't mind -- I love hole in the wall places, if the food is amazing. But since it was on the pricey side, one expects nicer."}
{"text":"Chicken satay and the spring rolls were good. Tom Yum Gum soup was watery and lacked the authentic taste. Mom felt sick after consuming that. Pad thai lacked taste and was also stingy with the chicken. Thai red curry was ok.  The service was absolutely terrible. Went on a saturday night where the restaurant was full (~50 people) and they had 2 servers. Never came to check on us and the one lady looked annoyed with the world. When I asked for the bill she never showed up, ultimately had to go to the counter and pay so we can get the hell out. Unless you are famished and are about to pass out don't try this one. There are better thai restaurants out there, so save your money and pass on this one."}
{"text":"Awesome food but not so great service. We went in a group of 4 and ordered 2 veg and 2 non-veg dishes. All the food was really good, but we waited for quite a while before we got it, and even after that it didn't arrive together. Overall, might be back for the food!"}
{"text":"Spent a week in the Vieux-Port district of Montreal, and passed this place several times.  Finally had a chance to dine here towards the end of our trip - and budget.  After a week of pricey meals in this very trendy part of town, Saigon 27 offered a very reasonably priced and delicious dinner for us.  We enjoyed the Pad Thai, which we eat everywhere and was among one of the better we have had this year, as well as the house special Pho which was very tasty and full of meat.  Both dishes were generously portioned.  This place was a real gem and should not be missed.  Service was friendly and accommodating, and location cannot be beat."}
{"text":"Positive was the location. FYI it is brown bag which we didn't realize. Food was decent but not enough flavor for me. I had the Singapore noodles and my daughter had pad Thai. Service was extremely slow and restaurant was only 1/4 full. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"After spending the day at Mount Tremblant my friends and I, thought it would be 'boujee' of us to have dinner in the Old Port of Montreal (lol).  If you're tourists like us, we didn't know a lot of the restaurants in the area were closed early. Like 7pm early on a Saturday night!  Since Saigon 27 was the only thing open, we had no choice but to eat here. My first impression of the place was that everything was outdated and kind of reminded me of my grandparents house. Fake plastic flowers hung by the windows, odd knick knacks here and there and Christmas ornaments were still displayed.   The food was not good or authentic at all. And it was quite pricey IMO. I think the worst part was the dessert.  I'm normally not a picky person and will eat just about anything, but the crème brûlée was gag worthy! The custard wasn't even \"brulée-d\".. There were still little grains of sugar at the top and it tasted like laundry/dish detergent. Not that I've ever eaten detergent before...but I would imagine that's what it would taste like.   Although our server was lovely, the service was lacking. The food came in incredibly slow and there were no check ups.   *sigh* so much for being boujee..."}
{"text":"We went there today and they were closed, only a sign saying \"closed temporary\".  We tried calling before going but it was always a voicemail. We just bought a coupon from mtlarabais and wanted to try this place. Something is fishy about the deal."}
{"text":"Very good.   Good value.  If you eat a lot of Viet-Thai, this was like Viet-Thai comfort food.  It was exactly what my wife and I were looking for and a nice atmosphere.  We had green papaya salad and grilled pork which they kindly placed onto rice instead of vermicelli.   The fried bananas were a great way to finish."}
{"text":"This is a small Viet/Thai place tucked right next to the Montreal Notre Dame Cathedral.  We stopped in for dinner and all in all, a decent meal.  The kids made the mistake of getting the Thai food (it wasn't authentic and didn't taste quite right).    The Viet food however, was another story.  The summer rolls were excellent and the grilled pork chop flavorful.  The wife and I shared the Saigon 27 special grilled plate (beef wrapped in Hawaii leaves, grilled pork chop, grilled pork meat balls, grilled shrimp, grilled pork loin, vermicelli, veggies and fresh rice roll wrappers) and it was great, enough for both of us and at a reasonable 27 bucks Canadian.    I'm sure the plethora of Viet restaurants in neighboring Chinatown are good or better but this place was pretty decent in a touristy trap kind of area."}
{"text":"We were in a pinch and needed a place to eat and this had vegetarian options- the pad Thai and red curry were good and the pho was just a little bland for our taste. Not the best food in the world but it did the trick!"}
{"text":"I would rate this place a 1.5/5 stars.   My friends and I took a road trip to Montreal for the weekend and we ended up trying this place out since a lot of restaurants in the area were closed.   To start off, the restaurant was cute and small, but the decor was quite old styled. The server was really nice and recommended a few places to check out in Montreal which was nice of her.   When it came to food, we ordered imperial spring rolls (deep fried spring rolls), spring roll (the ones wrapped in the clear rice paper), general Tao chicken, teriyaki chicken, the special pho, creme brulee, and the deep fried banana with green tea ice cream. I will say that the general Tao chicken and the special pho were probably the best thing that we ordered. The imperial spring rolls were decent, but nothing special and they were expensive for the amount you got (2 spring rolls for $6). The \"spring roll\" was average, but you got charged $5 for ONE spring roll. Quite insane that we paid $3/imperial roll and $5 for 1 spring roll...   Normally you think dessert is the best part! Well you're wrong! I'll start with the deep fried banana with green tea ice cream. It was quite odd that the menu had nothing about ice cream, but when we asked, they had green tea ice cream available apparently (not sure if it was the owner's own ice cream that she bought from a superstore or not). Anyways, the deep fried banana tasted very \"pancakey\", but the green tea ice cream was fine. But then again, how can you mess up ice cream right?   Now for the best part, the creme brulee! I totally wished I took a picture of the creme brulee as words don't do justice. To start off, the sugar at the top wasn't even torched. There were bits of sugar just sprinkled on... When you struck the creme brulee with your spoon, it didn't crack, it just went straight in. And lastly, the taste!! It tasted like the lemon dish detergent! I couldn't even eat it because it was that bad.   I don't mean to bash the restaurant at all, but I was quite disappointed with the food, especially for the amount that we paid. If we ever do visit Montreal, we will not be returning here. Sorry."}
