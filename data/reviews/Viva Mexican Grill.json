{"text":"I cannot understand how this place is still in business. The food is bad... no taste, greasy, and the carne asada is tough. Nothing to come back for. I live across the street from it but I'd rather drive somewhere else. I like supporting small business but this place makes it tough."}
{"text":"Service sucks...! No really it sucks. Im all about supporting local businesses but i will no longer give these folks any of my money. The cashier girl at night is very un professional,(never smiled once the whole time i was there), lazy and a little rude, I've lived in the area ten years
And have eaten here three times, two times within the last two weeks now i see why i never eat here. The food was \"ok\" at best i told the girl i liked the green chili chimichanga she said..Oh no i don't like the chimichangas here! I asked why she said i just don't..! Then she walked to the back and talked to to cook the whole time,it felt kind of weird because I'm a a people person and i just tried to engage in a lil conversation about the food while i was waiting but all she wanted to do was bother the cook, which caused him to take a really long time to prep my order.so i finally got her attention to tell to make my order to go..the place was empty and the tables where filthy..! (Same service same girl twice)..To the owners You need better customer service being your food is not all that great. I noticed the \"cashier wanted\" sign on the door so maybe hire someone who is friendly and cares about your restaurant...! GOOD LUCK  9/6/13"}
{"text":"Ive been eating at this little restaurant for a couple of years, food was decent, until today in my rice and beans i found short. Black hairs! The cook had a beard, and no mask over beard... I showed the cashier , he said ill tell the mnager, so sorry. I won't be going back... Black Hairs!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. I just had a carne asada torta and it was the shiznit!! I love their horchata too!  =]"}
{"text":"Waited over 10 minutes for 3 tacos that were over cooked and tasted horrible. Their salsa was pure water. Filibertos is better, if that means anything to you. I have eaten here a few times and it has constantly gone downhill. Never again."}
{"text":"My favorite place for roll tacos !! Been coming here for 2 years every time I stop in town. Love it"}
{"text":"Worst place ever!! Rude rude rude!!! Food sucks! STAY AWAY if you have any dignity for yourself..dirty place.. Old food.. Rude cashiers.. Management does not train \"servers\" on customer service. Called to speak to manager and cashier had major attitude & said she didn't know managers name.. I heard the other girl in the background saying our managers name is VERONICA. Yet, she insisted that she will not give out the managers name so I could make a complaint. People of Avondale support other local restaurants that care about service.. There are better places that will respect its customers and be happy to serve you.. Sassy attitudes will be its own downfall.  Support hard workers wanting to succeed by choosing a better restaurant..This place is a major joke to small restaurant establishments trying to make it. Simple rule for cashier servers.. If you don't like your job or customer service isn't your thing.. Find a job that fits you,  stay out of the service industry or have a fake it till you make it attitude."}
{"text":"I love the food here. The tacos are my absolute favorite.. The shells are crispy and thin with all the fixings including tomatoes . I love Taco Tuesdays I am always there.. They are fast and accommodating. I have been going to this establishment since it was El Gran Taquito very pleased."}
{"text":"When I first started going here the food was delicious but I noticed they got new people and the food hasn't been that great. The food is a little pricey and the wait time can be a little long."}
{"text":"Not a bad little joint, and quite comparable to Filiberto's. I mainly get chorizo or carne asada burritos and both have been pretty good. On the weekends, I'll get their red menudo, which tastes fine, but is a bit heavy on the tripe and light on the hominy. The employees are pretty friendly, as well. A place worth returning to for a quick, cheap bite."}
{"text":"i paid $10.85 for a bowl of cosido de res and only received 3 small pieces of beef and corn was still hard. no flavor. this is last time ordering from there."}
{"text":"Horrible , way to over priced for what you get. I can make better Mexican food at home than this place. Your better off going to Taco Bell that's how bad the food tastes they do not take pride in what they do. Food was cold to top it off.. I'm Mexican and this food was awful."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst Mexican food place in not only Avondale, but all of West phoenix. Have tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt, but this was the last straw. Don't believe this picture is real? Take a look at the tile and the white board frame. It's absolutely a heartless excuse for a Mexican restaurant. With all the choices nearby try something different."}
{"text":"Actually pretty good. If you can see past the atmosphere then you can see that the food taste good. I tried a carne esada plate and it was good. Keep in mind this is relative to other restaurants in the same class, it is above the other cheaper Mexican restaurants in the 7-10 dollar range."}
{"text":"Went in because I wanted a couple tortillas to go with dinner, figured a Mexican hole in the wall restaurant would be a good place for tasty tortillas..... WRONG!  Took 5 min before anyone acknowledged I was there, I should of just left.  The staff looked totally disorganized. I asked for two tortillas to-go. She looked at me like I asked for her to knit me a sweater with dental floss, she had to ask 3 people if she could sell tortillas. 10 minutes and  $3 poorer, I was the not so proud owner of two of the nastiest tortillas I have ever had! They were gummy & hard at the same time, how is that even possible?!? They had a disgusting aftertaste, didn't even want to throw them out to the birds. Gross!"}
{"text":"Today I placed a phone order at 6:33 pm...it's 7:26 pm and I haven't received my food.  They never put the ticket in line, therefore the food order never was started.  In addition, they continue to ignore the incoming phone calls.  This place is very unorganized tonight, needs some management oversight.  Very frustrating..."}
{"text":"Service was slow. Considered bar backing myself, no bar keep. Food was sub-par. Stay away."}
{"text":"I come here for taco Tuesday and you can't beat the tacos for $1.  The rice and beans are great tasting.  The place is always packed and the staff is friendly.  I will continue to come back.  Only bad thing is they close at 9pm wish they were open later. Thx for good food and service"}
{"text":"This was my favorite spot for taco Tuesday but after continued messed up orders and orders taking half hour plus after I called it in...I just don't have the patience anymore.  Every week, it's excuses and telling me sorry yet every week they repeat their mistakes.  There are other options for tacos in laveen and I'll be going to those from now on."}
{"text":"Just tried there food for the first time and the green burito I had was really good and had me wanting more."}
{"text":"Preordered food from there 2 chorizo, egg, cheese and potato burritos and a rice, bean and cheese burrito... one chorizo burrito had no cheese, both burritos had uncooked potatos in them and the rice and bean burrito was more then the 2 chorizo one which I dont understand if it's just rice and beans and cheese. Oh well wont eat there anymore. This is my first time posting a review so yes it was terrible good service but bad cooking."}
{"text":"So, I returned and tried a lengua(beef tongue) mini taco. Once again, delicious, with melt-in-your-mouth tender cubes of meat, and the lovely contrast of raw onions and cabbage.

their tortilla chips? not that great...they were too hard, too greasy, although they did have a good amount of salt. I had them with their salsa...very spicy and smoky, but it was more of a bean salsa(not chunky, but a powerful flavor of beans...not my thing)."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken chimichanga.  The chicken was dry and had a fairly strong unpleasant poultry odor.  The chimichanga had been cooked too long and had no flavor. 2 stars because the rice and beans were OK but those are pretty difficult to get wrong. I also did not like the \"no signature required\" receipt that they gave me to get me to fill in the tip portion. They should first concentrate on earning a regular customer and not on shamelessly deceitful ways to get an extra dollar out of me."}
{"text":"This place is right in my neighborhood, and I usually go for takeout. The food is good and cheap - think a slighly more upscale Filiberto's without the resulting stomach ache. Very casual, order at the counter and seat yourself. Try the lengua and the albondigas. My one complaint is the hours - 7:30am to 9pm. A place like this needs to have early morning hours for the breakfast burrito crowd and late night hours for the fourthmeal crowd. Not that there's ever been a crowd in the place - but maybe there would be if they were open later!"}
{"text":"Albondiga soup is great. This place beats Filiberto's.  Everything I have tried is good."}
{"text":"I love grabbing the enchilada and taco lunch special to go. BUT the customer service I have received so far is terrible! Right away the woman gave me a dirty look, hardly said anything, I think she noticed I didn't tip and her face showed it. I didn't see she had handed me a cup, so I asked for one and she rudely said \"yeah I put it over there..\" sad because the food is good!"}
{"text":"I thought is was mediocre. I had the menudo which had toooo much tripe, but very tasty! I will order again. my husband had a red chili burro, which was horrible. I also had a bean and cheese burro that was very good! I wouldn't recommend this place to friends, but I will return to try new items on their menu."}
{"text":"Used to get good food. Go there like twice a week. One day I went in ordered some tacos to go. When I got home the tortillas were cold. They did not make the attempt to warm them up not even microwave. And they took their time making the food. If you forget to make an order throw in an extra taco and tell the cashier to apologize and that you hooked me up to make up for the delay."}
{"text":"So sad this little gem is serving food so hot it makes it unpalatable, and not spicy hot just too hot to eat. 2nd time I have ordered Green Chile burrito and can't even get a bite because of its heat. I decided to take it home 1.5 miles away and checked it's temperature still 165 degrees."}
{"text":"I come here a couple of times a month and was really upset today when they told me I couldn't add beans to my torta and no jalapeños. Mind you I paid $1.30 extra for this. The reasoning for the jalapeños bc they don't want to cut them up and no explanation for the beans. I add beans EVERY time. It is unfortunate as a torta really should have these things anyway. I also got told another time that on Tuesdays I could not order breakfast burritos because it takes too much time."}
{"text":"Waited for my order to be taken while two of the workers sat at the bar in their phones. One of the girls came out from the back while the lady on her phone told her to see what I wanted. Cool. Girl taking order was very nice and friendly. Took orders. Proceeded to wait half an hour for 8 tacos with only one couple and another customer in the restaurant. Obviously regulars or friends all staff continued to stay at the couples table talking, on their phones etc.  never once came to tell me how long my order would be or would even acknowledge me staring at them. Finally half an hour later bland tacos and no tasting salsa come out. Not worth the wait whatsoever. Rude staff. Apparently if you're not a friend you get crap service."}
{"text":"When I ordered my food at the counter the cashier verbally asked for a tip. What?! I just lost my appetite. I haven't even had a bite of food and will never be back......Looking for Mexican food? Try Villas which is nearby and always great."}
{"text":"Bland, greasy and uneventful. Had the flautas, got 3 greasy rolled tacos with a sprinkle of cheese, I had to pay extra for the guacamole and sour cream. Absolutely tasteless. Boyfriend ordered the tamale plate.. Tamales were dry and over microwaved. Will not be coming here again that's for sure. Next time I'll have Taco Bell for \"authentic\" Mexican."}
{"text":"I have been a customer here since they opened. The customer service has always been the same, not interested but never rude. The part I'm concerned with is the food. Seems that when the remodel was completed the food took a hit. The only thing that kept me coming back was the food. Too many other choices of food that is more consistent in the area to settle."}
{"text":"Food is ok, service is neutral, no small talk. The place is de entry clean and their service is relatively fast. I would recommend it to others. I would say it falls under the authentic umbrella, considering regional variations."}
{"text":"I have found my new fix when I need a burrito and a horchata. This place is top notch! Like a diamond in the rough! Try the lengua! It was the first time I ever had it and it was delicious! Everything is good. I almost want to give the menudo a try....don't even question it. If you need some good Mexican food in your body just come here. They are super friendly, the food is amazing and it's fast service. I love the atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Been here less than a handful of times. Carne Asada, chicken and pastor are ok, but the fish tacos are very good! Salsas are ok. Service was eh.. asked for horchata for my son a couple times before he got it, my husband asked for more limes and didn't get it. Never refilled our water. Not a place I would go to on a regular. I'd probably go again just for the fish tacos, but order it Togo."}
{"text":"The best service and the best Pozole!!! I'm so glad that FINALLY a great restaurant with GREAT food...and open EARLY!
AND IT IS CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN!!!!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed. However, the burritos are huge. Theres not much to be said. Just another mexican place. A bit over priced."}
{"text":"Dont come here! Save your time and money! Terrible service!  Cold to no personality!  No warmth or a friendly hello. It took 20 mins to get two hard .99 cent tacos. The food was Taco Bell grade."}
{"text":"This place had really bad customer service! To start off with I had to wait a while in order for the cashier to take my order, I specifically ordered 3 chicken tacos and got beef instead, I ordered 2 bean and cheese burritos and got two carne asada burritos, and very expensive for what you're getting. Did not like it at all."}
{"text":"I really do adore this place. I go there at least 3 times every time I visit Arizona. The food is inexpensive and very authentic. I believe all the chefs are women and they're cooking is delicate and precise. The decor isn't great and it's a little dark but it's still my go to place for breakfast burritos and taco Tuesday's - Highly recommend."}
{"text":"First time here and tried the number 10. The three chicken tacos were good but didn't like waiting 15 min for them."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and don't go here. Horrible slow service. I mean the girls were not rude, just seemed like it was first day on the job. (Which I know it wasn't). Paid attention to take out orders instead of diners. Waited 40 mins for 6 cold plain tacos. Plus they pretty much showed up with whatever \"they wanted to bring me\" after I clarified exactly  what I wanted, cuz I dont eat onions. My wife was very upset. Her order was cold and did not seem fresh cooked. I will not return."}
{"text":"Caimos por accidente en este local y gracias a la ayuda de Yelps aunque teníamos dudas por las malas reseñas hacia el restaurante pero como es costumbre me gusta dar el beneficio de la duda ya que las reseñas son de 2014 y 2016 y no se si exista nueva administración o que paso pero el trato fue excelente y la comida a la temperatura y sabor exacto. Limpieza y un ambiente muy ahradable"}
{"text":"Best Mexican spot in Laveen! I love Taco Tuesday! Martha is awesome & always accommodating. Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food!  I've been visiting this place for a out 10 years and you Can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  This is a family-run business, and they really care about food quality. I would really recommend this place for a good Mexican food meal."}
{"text":"Awesome salsa, delicious machaca beef fries and tacos. Delicious mango margaritas and really nice waitresses with good service. Decent sized place , not at all a hole in the wall but pretty nice casual dining. I enjoy this spot a lot :)"}
{"text":"Never again!!! Save your money and go elsewhere. The enchiladas have absolutely NO flavor. There was less then a spoonful of beef in my taco. The rice was very bland as well. Not to mention service is extremely slow. There was about 4 other tables there as well so it wasn't busy at all. They servers look like they hate their jobs and didn't seem friendly. I also ordered a michelada and it was watered down! I don't recommend this place at all!!!"}
{"text":"Great food!!!  my favor place to eat real Mexican Food is Viva Mexican Grill , also employees are very friendly , very clean reastaurant."}
{"text":"I had tried Viva multiple times several years ago and gave up on them due to repeatedly getting take out orders wrong.  I decided to give Viva a try again this week and while my order was correct, everything else about my visit was blah.

The cashier was rude and clearly did not care about any aspect of their job.  They responded to my greeting with a blank stare.  My drink was served covered in soda all over the outside of the cup.  My food was put on a tray and was placed on a counter no more than 10 feet away from where I sat.  I was told to come get my food, rather than have it brought to me.

I ordered the 3 chicken enchilada lunch special.  The food was bland and tasted like no effort was put in to the production.  The chicken was dry and unseasoned and the enchilada sauce was tasteless.  I get more flavor down the street at Taco Bell.

When I was finished, I took my tray and plate to the waste area.  On top of the waste area was a restaurant kitchen tote that was full of dirty plates.  It was absolutely disgusting and looked like it had been there building up all day.  

Overall, save yourself the agony and go elsewhere.  The people running this business clearly don't care about their food, the dirty facilities, or to make their customers feel welcome."}
{"text":"I ordered caldo de rez. The vegetables where undercooked and the meat tasted horrible. I could not eat more than three bites it was so horrible."}
