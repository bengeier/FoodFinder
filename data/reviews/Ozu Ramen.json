{"text":"I think the Raman itself is not bad, but it is a little bit pricy according to its quality. The waiters are very friendly, but they somehow charged my bill more than its actual value, and it's not easy to communicate with them during their rush hours.  Personally I think the soup is a bit watery, but it really depends on the personal taste. I would not go there often or for casual gatherings."}
{"text":"Wings are great but ramen is totally shit. If you ever tried the real Japanese ramen, you would have the same feeling as I had."}
{"text":"Their ramen tastes OK, but is definitely not worth the price ($10+). I'm Japanese, trust me."}
{"text":"We were surprised that this restaurant is underrated. Ramen that we've ordered is excellent just like the ramen in Japan. We enjoyed very much. The waitress is very attentive and service is good"}
{"text":"My friends and I went here on their opening day. Like other reviewers have mentioned, this place is pricey - especially for a college town. I had the Tonkatsu Black, which they advertise as a chef special w/ limited quantities per day, and their chicken karaage and I was thoroughly underwhelmed. We were all served our ramen at different time, and a friend of mine cancelled his order because his ramen came after the rest of us had finished our ramen.   Their Tonkatsu Black was very salty and the garlic flavor was very strong. The initial taste was decent, but then the garlic hits and overpowers everything else in the ramen. I'm a fan of garlic, but there was way too much in the broth. The chashu that was included was very fatty, and it made me feel kind of gross by the time I finished it. I noticed that the broth was very grainy, and I ended up leaving most of the broth because I just could not take the garlic and texture.   The chicken karaage that we ordered didn't come until after my friend and I had both finished our ramens. This includes the time we waited for the kitchen to get ready and even start preparing the ramen. One of the waitresses came over and asked us what we were waiting for, and when we said we had ordered the chicken karaage, she immediately apologized and asked us if we'd like to eat here or take it to go. We replied that we'd like to eat it there, but when the chicken came out, my friend and I were very surprised to receive it in a to go box. The sauce wasn't even separated from the chicken - it was poured to the side, and there were only 6 or 7 pieces of chicken in the to go box, which was very small compared to the portions we saw other tables getting. Because the sauce was poured on the side, some of the chicken pieces were drenched in the sauce - my friend and I could hardly finish the chicken.   Their service needs a lot of work. While I was eating my Tonkatsu Black, one of the waiters came by and asked how it was. I replied saying that the garlic flavor was a bit too strong for me, and he quipped back that that was how the Tonkatsu Black is. Another waiter passed by later and asked me how it was, and I didn't want to be reprimanded again for my opinion, so I just said it tasted fine. I felt this was ridiculous, and not the way a customer should be treated, especially during a soft opening of a restaurant.   As we were almost done with our ramen, our original waiter came by and said that as an apology for the long wait, they were bringing out complementary lemonade for us shortly. We waited an additional 30 min ( we were also waiting for our chicken to come out ), and it never came. We could also tell that the staff wanted us to leave as soon as possible.   Overall - the food was below par, the chicken was barely edible, and the service and the wait was terrible. The only thing fast about this place is how fast they get your check to you."}
{"text":"The service is horrible, was placed near the kitchen and got showered whenever someone washes something; keep splitting water on me and my food even after I politely remind them."}
{"text":"This is solid ramen, in my opinion. I've been to a few of the better places in the Bay Area back in CA (Orenchi etc.) and I feel that this place is close to them. I feel that at least some of the negative reviews are from people from Asian-heavy areas who view Asian food in Chambana through a rose-colored lens, which to me is corny af.  Way better than Koto Ramen, which got pretty bad fast.  I generally get Tonkatsu Black here.  Positives: -Great meat, and tonkatsu broth has good flavor. I liked the miso the one time I had it too. -Noodles are solid -Egg is solid  Negatives: -You're pretty much out of luck here if you're vegetarian or don't eat pork due to their broth -Prices are a little on the high end, especially $4 (?!) for extra ramen where it's half of that elsewhere -Personal thing, but their tonkatsu black needs to have more black sesame oil  Still fairly solid."}
{"text":"Ozu is mad dank, bruh. Shouts out to Tianrun for running this shiiiii. Love me some raw men. Ramen*"}
{"text":"The taste is okay, i would give it 3 stars, which is the best ramen you can find in champaign. However the service is too damn slow. I waited 1 hour to get my ramen."}
{"text":"Ramen is not something that Champaign-Urbana has done well in the past, and Ozu Ramen isn't gonna change that.  What Ozu Ramen does right are the ramen toppings. The chashu/pork is more burnt than I wanted, but I couldn't tell in the taste. The perfectly soft-boiled eggs are oozing with golden gelled yolk. The woodear is an interesting addition, but it works. The bamboo shoots and naruto are fine, okay. You can't screw those up.  But what you can screw up, and what Ozu Ramen does screw up, is the broth. Good God, do they make terribly bland ramen broth. No matter how incredibly tasty they make the toppings and noodles, everything is just soaking and stewing in this flavorless puddle. At least eventually my ramen got salty enough from all the tears of disappointment that dripped down my face.  Thoroughly mediocre, but has room for improvement."}
{"text":"We had been really looking forward to going to this place since there weren't any good ramen place in town before. When we get there, there were only about two people waiting. We got seated fairly fast and we got our order down fairly fast. Then we proceed to waited a full one hour until we asked where is our food, then we were told that they don't have our order down and if we decide to stay, we had to wait an addition of 50 minute for our food.  So we just left. This is absolutely unacceptable and I am not planning to go there again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Ordered the Shoyu, which was pretty good. Wish I had orderd the Tonkotsu/Tonkotsu Black though because the flavoring of Shoyu was a very strong soysauce/sesame flavor while the Tonkotsu was lighter and watery. Definitely will come back though because the ramen was good and loved our waiter who was super helpful in picking a ramen."}
{"text":"Food is fine but service is suck. They didn't make good seat arrangement. They just let people who came after us seat first. Even we told them they still do nothing. The spoons are greasy. Not sure they make throughly cleaning. I ordered tonkotsu black and it said it will come with two pc of chashu; however, we only got one for each ramen."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to Ozu opening because I was hoping for some really good ramen in Chambana! Unfortunately, the experience was mehhh. Food was alright, but the kitchen and waiting staff definitely need to be trained better. My guests and I were the first ones in the door and, if the staff at Ozu are looking, you guys really have to address the following:  1. The hostess was extremely nice, but even if there are a ton of people at the door, you should still seat each party instead of letting them find their own seats. We were the first ones in the door and the last ones to get cups of water (which took approximately 20 minutes).  2. Food took forever to come out and there was issues with their computer systems, but entrees should ALWAYS come out together. As for us, two ramen came out first and the third came out almost 20 minutes after. That's totally unacceptable because most guests won't eat until everyone can (which is a shame because our food was getting cold by the time everyone could eat).   Otherwise, the staff was extremely apologetic and did comp us some food/drinks for the wait. But the problem was that I was there for almost 3 hours! Food tasted alright, but most food isn't worth a 2 1/2 hour wait.   TLDR: Nice (but inexperienced) staff, okay food, ridiculous wait (2.5 hours for entrees). I'll definitely be back eventually, but I'll be waiting for Ozu to figure out all their issues.  EDIT: I just found out that we went during a \"soft open.\" So I bumped them up a star! I hope Ozu Ramen all the best!"}
{"text":"I came before when they just opened and the ramen was very meh. But I came back recently and it's seriously improved! Awesome noodles and the tonkatsu Black is going to be more salty and savory, but the soup was thick and to my liking."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend with a group of friends for dinner since we were in the area and we were seated right away. I got the tonkotsu ramen, which came with chashu pork, corn, soft boiled egg, wood ear, and bamboo. The broth was okay and the egg was good (I just wish there was a whole egg instead of a half). The wood ear was  undercooked and was really chewy. The flavor of the pork wasn't bad but the quality of the pork was meh...the meat was tough. Overall, the ramen is edible and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"This review isn't about the food. Because the only thing I had in my 75mins stay there was water.   The service is so bad. We waited for our ramen for 60 mins and then waiters told us the order was not down due to system reason and they would like to help us order again and we would need to wait for another 50 mins. They wouldn't admit their fault and try to blame on the system. :/  The food might be good but I decide that the potential risk of wasting one hour for nothing is too much for me.   To people who want to try the food here: if you don't mind such risks and you definitely like ramen, give it a try; else, just don't bother."}
{"text":"I went alone just ordered a ramen. But I waited forever for that ramen. Food is ok though a little bit too \"garlicy\" and salty but I still like it. I had the black tonkutsu ramen."}
{"text":"I know this place has gotten a lot of hate for being a long wait but also, it's a new restaurant and there's a lot of hype about it and I think they're doing really well!  Food wise:  Shoyu and tonkatsu ramen had a lot of flavor and was definitely some of the best ramen in the area. Personally I like my ramen noodles to be a little firmer but that's my personal preference. The soup was very pleasant and flavorful, but did seem a little grainy for some reason but it wasn't anything that ruined the meal. Sadly we did not get to try to tonkatsu black ramen, but we will be back to try it again.   Service wise: We went during dinner rush so around 6:00 and we were told there was going to be 45-50 minute wait but then we got seated in 20 minutes. The kitchen/system did forget our orders, but when our server found out we didn't have our food he made sure it came out really quickly afterwards. What I assume was the manager also apologized to us for making us wait. Overall the servers were very busy but very nice and sure to address any issues/questions we had quickly."}
{"text":"Service was rushed when the establishment wasn't busy at all and the food lacked any flavor."}
{"text":"TL;DR (out of 5): Another ramen shop has popped up in town to try to rival Sakanaya... And failed. I had high hopes for Ozu Ramen, but was quickly disappointed by their lack of quality, organization, and ingenuity. Compared to Sakanaya, Ozu Ramen has lower standards, smaller portions, the same prices, and an overall worse experience.   Food: 3 Atmosphere:5 Price: 3 Service: 1 Decor: 3  Signs for Ozu Ramen started appearing Fall of 2016, looking quite promising, with a Facebook page and regular updates on their progress. But upon opening, they've been unable to cope with large crowds and have yet to implement an effective service/reservation system. They had a soft opening on Monday and Tuesday this past week and then closed, stating that they would have their grand opening on Thursday. However, when I went for lunch this past Saturday, they were closed with signs stating that they were in the process of making changes based on feedback and would re-open on Monday. As my friend stated, \"My feedback would be to stay open after your grand opening.\"  I finally got to Ozu for dinner and was overwhelmingly disappointed. Walking in, I was asked if I had a reservation, to which I replied no, and was told the wait would be 30 minutes. I asked if I could place a reservation for later and was then informed that they \"don't do reservations.\" So I put my name on the list and sat around for a bit.  They really need a POS in the front - both to unclog the single POS next to the kitchen and to serve as a reservation/seating system (one that keeps track of how long people have been seated, if they've ordered, been served, or been given their check, and to create some systematization in terms of waiting time - not just a clipboard with names and numbers and a host who calls people on his cell when its their turn).  Ordering the Tonkotsu Black, I received a precautionary \"Some customers have complained that it's too savory, so do you still want to order it?\". My friend ordered the regular tonkotsu. I also asked the waitress if there was any MSG in the ramen since my friend was sensitive to it, to which she replied that \"everything is prepared from scratch in the morning.\" 5 minutes later, she came back, informing us that \"the vendor packaging says that there's a little bit of MSG.\" We said it was fine. My question should've been: \"What are you using in your broth where you would have a vendor product? I thought everything was made from scratch.\" But nonetheless, we also ordered takoyaki and chicken karaage buns.  Our ramen came out within 20 minutes, followed by takoyaki 10 minutes later and the buns 15 minutes after that - all served by different people (who were not our server). Everything just seemed to function as a system of chaos - grab whatever you can, whenever you can.  Anyways, we ate our food, which came out hot and fresh.  The takoyaki and chicken karaage buns were well made and flavorful.  However, when it came to our ramen, we were hit with a bomb of garlic and salt in both of our broths, not just the \"extra savory\" Tonkotsu Black.  My bowl came with a moderate portion of ramen, a square of dried seaweed, half of a soft-boiled egg, one slice of fish cake, some green onions and bamboo shots, and two pieces of chashu.  (A little nitpicky, but I was confused why there weren't two egg halves and two slices of fish cake.  That's traditionally how ramen is served.)  To be honest, I would've rather eaten a whole bowl full of soft-boiled eggs.  They were perfectly made with a slight sweetness and that signature Japanese \"umami.\"  My chashu was relatively plain, but tasted like quality, fatty pork belly.  However, my friend's chashu was chewy, almost sinewy and had a very unpleasant mouth-feel, even though they both came out at the same time.  But now onto the main event and what everyone has mentioned: the broth.  My Tonkotsu Black only had a slightly stronger, \"more savory\" pork flavor, in part due to a lot of fat in the broth, compared to the regular Tonkotsu.  But the biggest issue I had with it is that it's just ridiculously salty.  I'm not sure if it just sits from when they make it \"fresh\" in the morning (friends have told me they don't have issues with saltiness at lunchtime), but for the first time in my life, I started having a migraine towards the end of my meal (one that lasted through the entire night, mind you) and I have never had issues with MSG, saltiness, weird foods, etc. before - definitely an interesting experience.  Ozu Ramen has A LOT to work on.  I'm still perplexed by how their menu or restaurant system has changed after \"respondin to feedback.\"  I wouldn't think twice about trying this place again until I feel like some big changes are made, especially with Sakanaya only a couple blocks away.  Maybe they should switch locations since this one has more seating.   Tonkotsu Black: $13 Tonkotsu: $12 Takoyaki: $6 Chicken Karaage Buns (2): $6"}
{"text":"The food isn't worth the price tag, but again, there aren't many options for ramen in town. The wait for food is quite long and our order wasn't put through correctly."}
{"text":"Not close to the ramen I had in Los Angeles, Tokyo or Shanghai. If you want something closer to the authentic Japanese Ramen, I'll suggest you to go to an Asian grocery and get a pack of Nissin??????of black garlic oil flavor?????????.  Chicken Karaage is OK."}
{"text":"I visited Ozu for their soft opening today for dinner. Me and two friends got there around 5:15PM and had to wait until 6:30PM for a table. We ordered a Karaage to share and then each got the Tonkotsu Black Ramen (a naming scheme taken from Shin Ramyun-- Black, maybe?) At some point, the woman in charge gave us free edamame to apologize for the wait, which was really nice of her. Also, she regularly checked in to make sure we were well served.  From there, we then waited another TWO HOURS for our ramen. The food was really tasty and worth the price but the wait was too long.  I know that a friend of mine who waited a similar amount of time got some sort of percentage off of his meal but this option wasn't available for me and my friends, which was disappointing. If I have a good experience at this place next time in terms of wait or if they offered us the same discount to accommodate our super long wait time, I'll probably update my review to be 5 stars.  Pros: -Great food, the broth is authentic and tasty -Good sized portions -Great noodles (not authentic but they're still tasty) -Really good Karaage (it's served with Kewpie spicy mayo but could really use a lemon. Also, there were a lot of fried dough pieces that didn't have any meat. I'd recommend getting rid of these because they're just kinda oily and detract from an otherwise really good appetizer.) -Good variety inside the ramen -Reasonable prices -Beautiful decor inside, I really liked the exposed kitchen area (super authentic looking!) -Really nice service (the lady helping us felt bad for the wait and gave us free edamame) -The staff were really attentive and refilled our water regularly -The menu selection seems really nice -Really good for a soft opening -Their take-out boxes are super sturdy and given the number of times I've had those soup containers melt/break on me, I can really appreciate that. -High quality meat  Cons: -Extremely long wait (we kept being told that our order was coming but we consistently saw tables seated after us get served first, this is why I took away one star for this place.) -The seating area where you wait to be called up is kind of small and you basically had to wait outside or next door at Latea. -The soft boiled egg was a little overcooked -The spoon given with the ramen was a little dirty, kinda wish I said something about it but I didn't want to bother the waitress. I would recommend getting a new one if this happens to you. It's probably just a dishwashing mishap. -The tables were a bit too close together in my opinion but this really wasn't a big deal.  All in all, I'm really happy with the food here even though there was a long wait. I can't wait for them to get into the swing of things because this place has a lot of potential and I'm happy to see a good ramen place other than Sakanaya on Green!"}
{"text":"I don't see why everyone is soo upset. The service and the food is as good as it gets.   They attend to our ridiculous needs even during busy hour.  Water refilled, napkins replaced, and always asking about our food & how we're doing.  Skip was our main server, but all other servers worked together to give the best experience to everyone -- including us.   Tonkotsu Black and Spicy Miso dense in flavor, egg done right, pork belly no where else on campus.  Hirata Bun & Chicken Wings - must trys!"}
{"text":"I was visiting UIUC and found this place on Yelp. I love ramen! It's conveniently close to campus. The interior is elegant and modern, which I wasn't expecting for a place likely frequented by students.   I had the spicy miso ramen and loved it. The service was great - quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Updated, see below for original post for my original ratings/issues:  The service has improved significantly, and the waiters/waitresses show more care for the customers. The broth is significantly less salty and the pork is more tender. I had the tonkatsu black and tonkatsu since I went there the first time. The tonkatsu black was fantastic, unfortunately when I went back for the tonkatsu the noodles were extremely soggy, but I'll assume it was an accident/one off since the firmness of the noodles fine the other 2 times I went. Overally major improvements have been made. Really impressed with the major turnaround and improvements and how much you guys listen to your customers.Unfortunately, although less salty, the broth is still far from \"savory\" or \"rich\" in both cases. The soggy noodles and the mediocre broth still leaves much to be desired."}
{"text":"Three stars for the staff, who were friendly, eager, and helpful, but the ramen itself wasn't all that great. The slice of pork belly that came with my shoyu looked (and tasted) as if it had been precooked elsewhere. My husband ordered tonkatsu ramen, but instead got two slices of the same cardboard pork belly...uh, that's not tonkatsu, sorry. The shoyu broth had a gritty, powdery texture and contained a couple slices of bamboo, half a chicken egg, and a single tiny slice of fish cake...that was all. For $12, I expected better. The decor was pretty slick, though it would have been better suited to an izakaya (and God knows we could use one around here)."}
{"text":"Ozu Ramen is a good place for ramen in the Chambana area. Of course with Asian food around here, it gets quite pricy. $12 average for a bowl of ramen.  I came here yesterday for their grand opening and we were seated within a couple of minutes. They opened at 11 and we were seated within 5 minutes. However, it took us 30 minutes to get our waters and roughly an hour to get our food.   I ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen and basically they took so long that I had to take it togo. All the ingredients were up to par and the soup base was decent. The only that that might concern some is how fatty the pork is.   The reason why I took off 2 stars for their slow service was because when we sat down, the server said that the kitchen needed 20 minutes to prep. They should have prepped before opening.   The waitresses were definitely very friendly and kept apologizing for the delays.   I'd come back when they have more staff and/or figure out what they're doing."}
{"text":"After spending years fantasizing about opening my own ramen place here in Champaign, I was excited (and a little saddened) to see that someone took the idea seriously and opened up Ozu Ramen.  We'll just forget the other ramen shop on Green street that came and went with little fanfare.    Most restaurants struggle a bit to work out the kinks in the first weeks of service, but our experience was smooth and pleasant.  Our server, Skip, was very attentive and efficient.  I saw that our neighboring eaters at the dining counter had a mix-up with their order, for which they received complimentary takoyaki.  I thought that seemed fair.  The restaurant itself is clean and attractive, with part of the kitchen open to diners and lending to an atmosphere of activity and culinary pride.  The tables of the main dining area are lit too dimly for my taste, but the counters up next to the prep station are brightly illuminated and comfy.  We ordered the chicken karaage to start.  It was lightly breaded, crispy without being too crunchy, and seasoned well.  Between the two of us, it was just the right amount.    I had the spicy miso ramen, which was rich and not unlike a tantanmen.  My broth was very good, up there with bowls that you might find in Chicago or New York.  My wife ordered the tonkotsu black, which on first taste was slightly bland, but had a flavor that built up as she ate, with a developing umami.  Unlike other reviewers, she wished for more garlic flavor.  In both our ramens, the egg was cooked perfectly, with the yolk just barely set.  The chashu was slow-cooked and then finished on the grill, which gave it a very good smokey flavor, although it might have benefited from a stronger marinade.  The noodles were lacking in bite for our tastes--a bit soft.    On the balance, this was good food with a few missteps, well worth the $12 if you want a good bowl of ramen."}
{"text":"It's good but it needs to be better.  You can tell that they do a lot of prep work and just pull things together as the order comes in.   If you order gyoza, it's fine, because it's made to order.  But their bread and butter is ramen, and they need to step up their game.   The broth and noodles are hot, but the rest are cold.  The soft boiled egg is cold.  The bamboo shoots are cold.  Even when the bowlis served to you, their is a wide contrast of temperature....kind of disappointing.  It needs to be all hot at the same time! This isn't a McDLT!!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time to visit.   Quality: 4 stars. Not too much, but not average. There might be pro and con, but I like. I ordered Syoyu ramen. Not good for health, but taste good. Average taste in ramen restaurants in Japan.  Price: 4 stars. Ramen might be reasonable comparing to urban area such as NYC and DC. Fried dumplings are not reasonable taking portion into consideration.  Staff: 4 stars. Friendly.  Atmosphere: 3 stars. Average.  Overall, I rate this restaurant as 4 stars."}
{"text":"Went in around 1 pm so we were seated immediately and received prompt and friendly service. I ordered the Tonkotsu Black and it was incredibly flavorful and tasty. Definitely best ramen on campus."}
{"text":"Went to Ozu Ramen for both their soft openings and grand opening.   Appetizers were great! Takoyaki, karaage, and the gyoza are probably my favorite. The edamame was a bit bland but easily fixed with salt!   Thus far, I've had the Tonkotsu and Tonkotsu Black. The Black is a creamier, garlicky version of the regular Tonkotsu. Definitely more premium and hearty, but the regular Tonkotsu was extremely filling also. Chashu was perfectly fatty, egg noodles had a great bounce (not over or under cooked).   As far as food goes, this place is phenomenal. Looking forward to trying out more and more ramen brothers.   Interior decor is interesting. Definitely an industrial feel. I love being able to see the cooks in action.   My only knock on this place is the inexperienced waitstaff. I can understand when wait times for food and seating is slow, but lazy and inexperienced waitstaff can fully be controlled. Luckily for Ozu, wait time will go down as the insane hype does down, and waitstaff can always receive more training.   Would absolutely treat Ozu as a regular restaurant!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see so many low reviews on Yelp. My friends and I went to dinner here last night and all of the food was amazing - we were all talking about how this is one of our new favorite places in Champaign Urbana! The service was great and the food was delicious and really nicely presented. It is much more authentic than anything else you would find around here, short of going to Chicago or another big city!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times in five days since it's opened. I came here opening day, and even though the first day the service was a bit slow (very understandable), the taste and texture of their ramen was delicious and authentic! I had my doubts since most ramen places on campus (or were on campus) do not typically make their ramen well, but Ozu is definitely worth a visit.  Since my first visit, I have noticed that Ozu has improved their customer service and the wait time to serve their food has significantly decreased. Good decoration and great food. I highly recommend the chicken kaarage and spicy miso. They're my favorite!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place and give it a chance after what they've done to improve and what my friends said about this place. After all, sometimes I want something more than my 25 cent ramen lunches.  The restaurant has nice decor and is relatively clean. Music playlist is alright and not too loud. The host and servers were very friendly and prompt to take your orders, get your waters, and get your bill ready for you.   But if college students cook the food, you're going to get college student quality food. BF had the spicy miso and I got the tonkatsu black. I was drawn in by the whole \"chef special\" and \"limited quantity per day\" in its description, and let me tell you: good thing it's limited quantity because it is absolutely trash. Unbelievably salty and overwhelmingly garlicky. Everything was so strong that it gave me a headache and lucky me still has the headache hours later. Everyone has already complained about the ONE piece of chashu and the half of an egg, so I won't go on about that. What did catch my eye was how my egg's yolk looked. I get that I shouldn't be expecting a freshly soft boiled every time, but it was obvious that my egg had been sitting around in the air for awhile, because the \"soft\" part congealed and became gelatinous and it just looked gross (the feel when an extra half of a soft boiled egg is $1 but a case of 18 eggs at Walmart was 99 cents). There was also just too much scallions as a topping. I usually try very hard to not waste the broth because broth is usually the most intricate and delicious part of a meal -- but my tongue just couldn't handle the abuse anymore.   Bonus: they have free cotton candy after your meal.   It was my first time at Ozu and I don't see myself coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"Interesting stop for lunch.  I had gyoza and barbeque bao bun, both were tasty. Only negative would be that it's not a lot of food for $13, even at lunch.  I would like to try some of the ramen bowls - they looked delicious."}
{"text":"I had higher hope for the place, but I was disappointed. I've been there 3 times since it opened. I feel like the quality of the food is just ok. The Tonkotsu is good. Broth has a strong garlic aftertaste. The miso ramen is for some reason $1 more than tonkotsu, but it tastes bad. The noodles aren't anything special. It's certainly too expensive for the quality plus the tip that you need to pay at this place. If you never tasted ramen, you should try, but don't hope for something authentic."}
{"text":"Tried the black tonkatsu ramen and very worth :) food came out in a timely manner. The staff was very polite and checked up on my table a few times."}
{"text":"Service was okay and the venue is new and clean, but that's about as good as it gets.  The soup tastes like garlic and salt and not much else. You can definitely get a better ramen for a similar price in another restaurant on Green St.  Also, the lack of vegetarian option makes this restaurant less accessible to people with dietary restrictions (religious and otherwise)."}
{"text":"I..didn't really like it. Got tonkotsu and it was unpleasantly sweet- sweet corn, sweet chasu and even noodles: broth was average. 12 bucks for a decent bowl."}
{"text":"Today was my first time eating at Ozu Ramen. It was closed until dinner which was going to be in about 15 minutes. A worker saw us standing outside and let us in, guided us to a bench we could sit at, and gave us glasses of water while the restaurant was still preparing to set up. This place really cares about it's customers and was very welcoming even when technically not open! The waitress helped us navigate the menu and was very friendly. Our food came in about 5 minutes after we ordered it and I was not disappointed. I got the spicy miso w/out mushroom or beef. The broth itself is delicious and they really hit it right in terms of spicing. They are very generous with the ramen and the soft boiled egg, corn, and bamboo were delicious bonuses! I will definitely be coming here again and bringing along friends! Amazing staff amazing food! My only complaint would be the price but in my view it's worth it for the quantity and quality of the food you're getting."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Not bland like others said from my experience. The appetizer (chicken karaage) did in fact sit for a little while before coming to the table, however, it was still hot and tasted very good. The ramen (tonkotsu) tasted great and was definitely some of the best ramen in the area. It took 30 minutes from ordering to come to the table (appetizer took 10) which really wasn't bad. The service needs work though. The service was not professional and do not communicate with each other so we had multiple people try to take our orders after we had ordered and multiple people trying to confirm we got the right food.   The food was good. The service not great. The price a bit expensive for the area. However, as it is the best ramen I have tried in the area and it was worth the $12 for the ramen and $6 for the karaage, 4/5."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I would call what I ate ramen. The service was pretty good and we were seated within 15 mins but the food was terrible. Maybe it's because I'm from the Bay Area but the ramen broth was lukewarm and the toppings were limited. The soup was also pretty watered down and the noodles had a strange taste to it. Overall, wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Meh. If you want confused waiters and overpriced ramen, this might suit you. Our waiter ditched us randomly in the middle of the meal, and another waiter asked us who our waiter was and for us to describe what he or she looked like... I get it, it's a college campus, and y'all are all friends with each other which is cute, but you really need to organize your staff, improve customer service, and be more professional. Also, I've had better ramen taste-wise and for cheaper pricing. Friendly people though~"}
{"text":"Being the only dedicated ramen shop in the area (as far as I'm aware), I had high hopes for Ozu in the case that I stay at UIUC for several years. Sadly I was let down by my first visit.  I tried the tonkotsu black. Broth was overly salty and had clumps of fat. Definitely could have used some straining/skimming. Pork was quite a small portion with only two thin, very fatty slices. Noodles were nothing to write home about. At least the egg was properly cooked.  Overall it's not that bad but it's not good either. I'll probably be back simply because there's nowhere else to really go."}
{"text":"I visited Ozu for their soft opening and grand opening. Both times, the food was flavorful and well made. I tried the Karaage and the Tonkotsu Black Ramen during the soft opening. And I had the Tonkotsu Ramen during the grand opening. I also tried some of my friend's Spicy Miso Ramen.The portion sizes for the ramen was above average, and I was pretty full after both trips. I definitely recommend the Tonkotsu Ramen if anyone isn't sure what to get. If someone really likes spicy food, the Spicy Miso Ramen was definitely spicy (not just your average sriracha sauce).   Food aside, the service definitely needs a lot of work. I was told by a worker that the current average wait time was 45 minutes which is far too long for a restaurant like this. Also, both times I went, the kitchen wasn't ready on time and we had to wait. Today for the grand opening, the opening for dinner was pushed back 30 minutes without warning so many people were waiting outside, and even after the 30 minutes delay, ingredients were still not done being prepped for another 15 minutes or so. I hope that many of these issues are due to lack of experience and testing for what works, but one easy fix I would recommend is removing some of the tables as they were first off too close to each other, but also it seems like there are just too many orders at a time.   That being said, the food was delicious and I saw a lot of improvement in procedures/service just from a few days. I definitely look forward to eating there again, especially when the kinks are figured out!"}
{"text":"Came here during lunch on a rainy day and was seated right away. It was kinda busy mid lunch service with mostly tables with parties of 6 or more.   Service was good. The waiters gave water right away and was accommodating. We got the gyoza to start. It was crispy to perfection but oily. Stuffed with cabbage and veggies and maybe pork as expected. I like the sauce because it has a hint of sriracha.   I ordered the shoyu and boyfriend got the spicy miso. The shoyu came out and had a good aroma.  The presentation was nice. Balanced with green onions, sesame, Chasiu, a soft boiled egg, bamboo shoots, and nice yellow ramen noodles. Everything was just ok. Wish it came with more chasiu.. so we ordered a side order. The chasiu is grilled and IG worthy...  cooked but not super soft. It's just ok. Get the spicy miso if you want to do the spicy ramen challenge 2.0.    The food, I will say, was oily.... it's overall just ok. Wasn't as salty as I expected but still got me reaching for my water. For offering good, authentic non-Maruchan ramen noodles in the middle of corn fields is already pretty exciting. I do agree with another yelper.. it does seem like a college spot served by college students and definitely has room for improvement.  Overall, this place is really cute and the food is just ok. Go during lunch cuz it's more worth the try. Decor and interior is pretty and I'm not mad about the water served in hipster mason jars. I would hope to see this place improve so we have variety on campus."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good quality Ramen, then Sakanaya it is.  When we went there for the grand opening, of course, there were a lot of people, but our ramen looked very oily and it wasn't very hot.  The food was relatively warm rather than hot and the meat was very thick and had a difficult time chewing.  At least, at Sakanaya they slice the meat into a small portion for the customers to eat but Ozu Ramen, I guess they do not care...  The broth had no flavor and the color of the broth was not what we expected.  We went back again hoping that they'll change the system and the food a little bit, but it was still the same.  If Sakanaya is filled with customers, then Ozu Ramen is your next choice but would not recommend if you're looking for a quality ramen.  At least try it once and decide if it's worth the time and money."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in town for ramen. I always get the spicy ramen. Oh so yummy."}
{"text":"Best ramen this campus has ever had. The Spicy Miso Ramen is so good! Just wish the noodles were a little thicker. The hours are awkward because they close for two hours midday. All in all, it had great flavor and very satisfying. Definitely going back. One of my favorite places in the C-U area."}
{"text":"This place is complete disaster. I think it's because it just opened, but still all of the servers and host have to get trained again. Food itself is good but the service has to be improved a lottt. 1. If the open time is 11AM, u shouldn't say the kitchen is still being ready at 11:15AM.  2. Customers should get their menus as soon they get seated. I got mine after like 20min I got seated(and I had to ask for it). If you guys don't have enough menus, print out more. 3. We got our water after 20min we got seated(chopsticks and spoons even later than that). Unacceptable. 4. Food for everyone in the same party should come out together. Mine came out 15min before my friend's. 5. I had to tell 3 different servers at least 5 times to get the check. I understand it's so busy but servers should do their job. If 3 servers are not enough hire more.  These r all rlly basic stuff so I hope the manager or whoever reads this and can make a lot of changes."}
{"text":"Definitely a top restaurant in the Champaign-Urbana area. Great place for UIUC students and residents of Champaign and Urbana to enjoy a lovely meal during lunch or dinner.   The service is usually on top of the world. Very friendly staff that makes your experience very delightful. Does the usual that you expect at every restaurant; brings you the menu and water along with a smile! You would be surprised at how many restaurants don't immediately bring you water. The smile is just a bonus!   I ordered a Tonkatsu ramen and the Chicken Karaage. Both very delicious and flavorful. The sauce for the chicken is unique and tasty. Would highly recommend getting an appetizer along with your ramen. Personally, a bowl of ramen is satisfying, but with an appetizer I feel perfectly full and content."}
{"text":"Ozu's Spicy Miso Ramen is testament to their mastery of a sultry umami dish with just enough heat to keep you craving more with every bite.  The host and servers could not have been more friendly or attentive in the middle of a lunch rush. Will certainly be back again soon."}
{"text":"Spicy Miso Ramen was a much better choice than Tonkatsu Ramen for first timers.  Shoyu is ok.  The management here is great and service is on-point.  I would imagine the Tonkatsu and Shoyu Ramen could do with more oil and garnishing (green onion and bean sprouts, perhaps), as some Japanese styles cater.  Mitsuwa in Arlington Heights uses this method for their ramen (sesame included and more oil use).  They are probably one of the most established ramen places in the Chicago suburbs, perhaps even the Chicagoland area.    Daikokuya, the most reviewed on Yelp! and one of the most popular ramen destinations in LA, uses a light taste similar to what Ozu offers here.  Their noodles have a firmer texture than what Ozu uses, but again, taste is subjective and even my taste will not necessarily be what others or the majority wants.  In all the ramen places I've been to, taste is subjective, but I will say again that the Spicy Miso here is better if you like a heavier kick to the taste.  Shoyu is light, if not a bit underwhelming, and I found the Tonkatsu to be rather bland and too salty."}
{"text":"Never order U-Dong! It's gonna take you more than half an hour before you could start."}
{"text":"I had the Tonkotsu Black and it was excellent. The ingredients used are very unique and very high quality.  I was a particular fan of the pork belly, trumpet mushrooms, wood ear mushrooms, and broth.  It was a good amount food but a little expensive.  Overall, I really like this place."}
{"text":"Ozu has definitely improved since its opening over a year ago. The broth tastes much less salty, which improved the overall taste of everything in the bowl. I particularly like the tonkotsu black and spicy miso ramens, and I recommend starting with an edamame appetizer, too."}
{"text":"No menu diversity. Everything on the menu is made with pork meaning that many people cannot eat here because there is nothing for them. Even all the side dishes had pork- had to physically leave the restaurant because I couldn't eat anything on the menu"}
{"text":"After missing out on their soft opening and walking over to the restaurant just to find out that their wait time was over 30-40 minutes, I finally got to try their ramen last week and was not disappointed. My friend and I went at around 7:30pm and surprisingly our wait time was only 10-15 minutes. We did get seated at the bar area, but didn't mind since we didn't really expect a fancy booth or a big table when eating Japanese ramen.  We were warmly greeted by one of the servers, and he was very friendly in offering us water and some help with the menu.  We ordered the Tonkatsu ramen, spicy miso ramen, and the chicken karaage as our appetizer. As many of the reviews already mentioned, the wait time on the food was pretty long, but I wasn't too surprised because of how packed the place was. The chicken karaage came out first, and I wasn't too pleased about the quality. It was hard and way too cripsy. The sauce was really good though. I don't think I'll be ordering that appetizer again.  Then came our ramen and we were both pleasantly surprised! The broth was savory and rich, and the noodles were tangly and not soggy. We did find some clumps of ramen noodles, but just pulled them apart with our chopsticks. I personally enjoyed the spicy miso more than the Tonkatsu ramen. Savory-ness did get a little too much towards to end for the Tonkatsu ramen and I needed some spice in their to finish the bowl.  It could be that we didn't expect much from the start, but I think this place is a lot better than the Kyoto ramen that recently closed further down on Green street. I think it's pretty comparable to Sakanaya's ramen, if not better. In terms of service, we did see the servers making mistakes here and there, but honestly, they opened 2 weeks ago. I think we can give them a break about that. They will need time to settle down and adjust to the large crowd they get. We personally did not deal with poor service, or menu mistakes. Our server was very good about filling up our waters (I drink a lot of water but never had an empty cup due to him filling it up instantly) even though we were in a corner bar area where it could easily have been neglected.  All in all, I think we just have to give them some time to adjust and they will fix their service issues. I don't really have any complaints about the ramen itself! Will be trying them out again later in the semester and try out their different ramen :)"}
{"text":"The Spicy Miso ramen is the chef's recommendation for a good reason - it's super flavorful and has the perfect amount of spice!"}
{"text":"I miss Champaign so much and it's only because of Ozu Ramen. My favorite is Miso Ramen. The pork belly is so good and tender. Also, Ozu's waiters are so cute !"}
{"text":"They made ramen inconsistently. The taste varied literally every different time I visited. The service is okay, but the price is definitely too high."}
{"text":"A cute ramen restaurant that I would definitely recommend trying at least once. After reading some other reviews, I tried the Tonkotsu (not a fan of garlic, so I didn't spring for the Black), however was not too blown away. The pork belly was waaaay too fatty, only about 20% of the serving was actual meat. The noodles were a little skimpy, or maybe it was moreso the lack of meat in the serving that made me feel like it wasn't really enough, especially for the price. Also got the gyoza as an appetizer, nothing to really write home about. The service was nice and the environment was nice for a sit down restaurant, would probably be a cute date place!   Overall, I don't think I will be having a craving for this place anytime soon, but wouldn't mind if my friends chose it as a meetup spot for dinner."}
{"text":"I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and I was pretty disappointed. Noodles are inconsistent and aren't very good. The broth tastes overseasoned and lacks pork flavor. They barely give any nori as well. Pork was a little stringy but other than that it was actually pretty decent. It was definitely the best part about the ramen. They don't have tsukemen either.   Overall there isn't much to say, it's just lacking in all respects."}
{"text":"Came back yet again, service food EVERYTHING top notch. Finally found out the name of my favorite server, Christina. Attentive, friendly, and great with suggestions. Great spot for ramen, and the tofu appetizer was very flavorful!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for 40 minuts, yet nothing happen. I had to double check with the them and find out that they forgot our order."}
{"text":"I would say this place has a pretty good ambience to start off with. The broth was seasoned pretty well and was not too salty. The meat was prime and tasted super fresh and tender. The noodles itself tasted pretty good and had the chewy texture that it was cooked right. Overall for a good bowl of ramen the place did the job. I got the tonkatsu black (yes the extra $1 is worth). But overall would try again"}
{"text":"I'd give it 3.5 stars. We ordered the tonkatsu and  tonkatsu black and the black was not as good.  I might go back to try the spicy miso, as that has gotten better reviews.  The real problem was service. We had to wait like 45 minutes to get our food.  When it came, it was alright but would have been better with two egg halves and more garnishes.  The pork was cooked very well.  Still, not sure it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"So far my favorite restaurant in champaign the decorations are nice and the staff there is pretty attentive. The wait might be longer than you think but it's worth it. As a result, I think we should all just give them more time to adjust considering the fact that most waitresses and waiters are students and they just opened 2-3 weeks ago. Ozu Ramen has a a bright future and I'm looking forward to see their improvement."}
{"text":"Best ramen in Champaign. Visit here occasionally when I miss Japanese foods. A bit pricey, but employees are super nice."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my second visit to this place. Their ramen in broth is filled with meat and plenty of flavor."}
{"text":"The \"Tonkotsu Black\" special ramen is very tasty, but the bowl I was served was merely warm, not piping hot as it should be. The pork cutlet in the ramen was excellent, but the marinated bamboo was soft and soggy. The place is incredibly understaffed: service was very slow at lunchtime, with only two harried servers rushing about serving at least 50 or 60 people. This place is close to being quite good, but the management really needs to put in more effort."}
{"text":"I would eat here all the time if I could but I can't eat pork or red meat and that's their only option. Pork is in all of their broths. Not very friendly to vegans and pollotarians, but great place if that doesn't matter to you."}
{"text":"Ozu is the best place for ramen in Chambana.  It's a casual sit down restaurant that's pretty trendy and has a decent spread for those looking to try Japanese food.  I've had the chicken karaage, buns, takoyaki, and ramen (tonkotus black, shoyu, shio, and tonkotsu).  Honestly, the tonkotsu black is pretty garlicky and doesn't have a super developed flavor, but it's pretty good for the given selection on campus (looking at you, Sakanaya).  The shoyu and shio are good for lighter flavors that isn't too heavy as well.  In terms of the appetizers, all are pretty good.  I highly recommend the takoyaki and karaage since Ozu is one of the only places to get them.  The takoyaki are always warm and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside while the karaage is usually fried with a tender inside and crunchy outside.  The wait staff are friendly, but they definitely seem not well trained.  Also the water can get warm since they pre-pour a few glasses during rush hours."}
{"text":"Popped over to try this place on my lunch break. Came during the noon hour. Short wait and quick service. The staff was very friendly despite being busy and the ramen was delicious. Generous portions of both noodles and broth. I got the Tonkotsu Black which was amazing with pork belly, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, seaweed and soft boiled egg. The prices are more than fair given serving size and ingredients.  The kitchen is open and the restaurant light-filled and welcoming.  A good mix of both students and non student types - such as myself. Adequate parking all around.  Will definitely be back to try more menu options."}
{"text":"We walked in and were greeted by the friendly hostess. Ordered the Spicy Miso and Shio. I'm a huge fan of ramen in general but unfortunately I was not too fond of this restaurant's version. I had the Shio and ordered a soft boiled egg and seaweed. The broth was tasty and the pork belly was extremely tender with lots of flavor but probably 70% of it was fat which I do not enjoy. If you prefer chewy noodles then you might like their ramen but me on the other hand I would have enjoyed it more if they were cooked a little longer."}
{"text":"Really disappointing. Took a friend here for his first \"real\" ramen (not the 99cent stuff), and both of us were not happy with how it turned out.   Got the pork broth based ramen, had absolutely no flavor. Literally tasted like noodles in saltwater.   All the ingredients were obviously low quality. Their pork, their corn, etc... was not as good as what you get at other places. I would not recommend this, even by chambana ramen standards."}
{"text":"It seems like Ozu's kitchen is having problems with producing the same flavors, at least from reading the other reviews. As far as my experience went, the inside of the restaurant was a clash of industrial inspired decor and house music; I wasn't sure whether I was in a modern makeover of a factory or a brightly lit night club. Wait staff were very friendly and welcoming. They seemed like students working part-times.  I was advised by the waitress that the Tonkotsu Black is \"too salty for some customers\". Red flag! So I ordered the regular Tonkotsu ramen. The egg was perfectly cooked, soft boiled and paired well with the salty (!) broth. Noodles taste a little cheap, and the unexpected toughness and chewiness of grilled meat threw me off. Still, I'd have to say Ozu is the best place for ramen in the CU... for now."}
