{"text":"I checked the menu online prior to going and thought it seemed pricey for run of the mill food, but the website claimed that they use fresh. local ingredients and I like to support businesses in my neighbourhood so decided to give it a try anyway.  I ordered the burger which, at $18, thought would be a delicious, fresh pattie. It was clearly frozen and I think they add a ton of garnishes to try to hide that fact. And it took 40 minutes to arrive. I ordered some grapefruit drink which was fine, but a giant rip off at $12. So after tax and tip, I spent $40 for a frozen burger and one 2oz drink which were both below average quality.  The staff seem like restaurant industry amateurs (disingenuous, apathetic to the length of time everything was taking) but who think they are providing top notch service at a high end establishment. There is nothing upscale or professional about House-Maison, it's like an H&M with Holt Renfrew prices.   I am also unsure why other reviewers are gushing about the decor and ambiance, there is nothing special (wow wooden tables and metal chairs!) about either and, in fact, when I was there the music was so loud I could barely hear my dinner companion.   Needless to say, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the music but the staff was extremely rude and the bouncers treated  me and a few others really bad because we wanted to go outside for a smoke and come back in but for some reason we were not aloud and pretty much yelled at. I might give this place another go but we will see."}
{"text":"House-Maison is not well known outside of it's neighborhood boundaries. I hope the word get's out about this amazing spot as it has it all, a beautiful historic building, outstanding large patio, tasteful rustic decor, great & expedient friendly service and an extremely talented new chef, Matt Cowan.   It's clear that the owners support Matt and his decisions to bring in high quality, local, fresh food from Ontario producers. I enjoyed asparagus soup during House-Maison's first lunch serving yesterday. Asparagus is ready to go in Ontario and Matt & team did an amazing job with this lunch special. The mussels in a saffron cream sauce are a must try and I'm just focusing on what I could ingest during lunch. It was difficult to choose. The bread is made in house! What more can you ask for??? Show up Toronto and enjoy! Bring a group, the patio has large tables to accommodate.   Can't wait to try brunch...I heard the cinnamon buns melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"Enjoyed delicious cocktails and dips on the patio in the late afternoon. Loved the patio. Great service, friendly staff, cool ambiance. Would definitely go back for lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"My favourite brunch spot in the Village. Great summer patio. Not sure why others complain about menu -- 3 variations of Benny on it!"}
{"text":"This is a generous 3 stars ONLY because I hope they get their stuff together.  Space is great...patio and decor great. Whoever created this menu should be fired. All staff should be fired. I was in shocked that the staff knew ABSOLUTELY NOTHING and did not offer to find out. I had to direct them to find out when all I got was \"I don't know\"!!!  So it wasn't a surprise that our table of 10 received all apps and entrées at the same time...how the kitchen didn't catch this is beyond me!  I was in shock when I received my $14 baked potato \"entrée\" which was a joke. Menu described it as braised short ribs, double baked potato,  stilton etc which sounded divine. I knew at $14 it would be a small portion so I also ordered the grilled calamari (which was decent but served in a ridiculous mixing bowl) as well. What I wasn't expecting was a maybe 4oz potato cut in half, inside a mixture of mashed potato,  maybe and ounce of tasteless meat and zero stilton to taste. When I was a server I would have been embarrassed to serve this. It was a side at best...certainty does not belong under main courses! It was basically a not very good $14 baked potato. The rest of the table was pretty mixed about their food...flank was apparently good, mussels fine. People witg burgers expected better for the price...I believe $17 but described as slightly better than Harveys.  Anyways many of us were disappointed and felt a little ripped off. We all expected more.  And that menu! I hope they can come up with something better because there is great potential. ...a little surprising from seasoned operator's in the industry."}
{"text":"Great mixed drinks and a really nice patio. I got their Sweet Pea salad that was really not exciting at all. Would recommend trying something/anything else."}
{"text":"This establishment, from first impression, carries a strong overall concept and brand image with straightforward and high quality offerings using locally-sourced ingredients. It functions as a hybrid of restaurant, café, and bar with a underlying club feel. Featured is a generous--and certainly the largest of the Church-Wellesley area--patio space that is relaxing and inviting with a wonderful view of the street and old Victorian house.   The menu is kept simple and is not complicated by a span of several pages. We ordered the beer battered fish and chips and braised Ontario lamb shoulder along with a side of the eggs benedict; all of which were very delicious and cooked well. Our server was super friendly and attentive. I will definitely return and recommend House-Maison!"}
{"text":"I totally forgot to check into this place of awesomeness when I was in Canada last month! This was a place of accident but a place i will accidently go into again! It is a restaurant in a converted brownstone or mansion either way it was truly cool!  The wait staff was knowledgeable about their food and was really accommodating to let us explain what we liked and what we would like on the menu. I'm a huge fan of deviled eggs and bacon and guess what...they had a combo OF BOTH....and it is how it sounds....amazing. It was a duck egg (which I never had) with crisp cuts of Applewood bacon.   Overall the food was great and when I'm back in the 6 I'll be at the HOUSE!"}
{"text":"House/Maison is a charming venue with a great patio right on Church Street. Unfortunately, this is where the good news ends. I have been here three times since it opened just over a month ago and was disappointed every time.  It may be just teething problems but the staff seem very disorganized, the bartenders unenthusiastic and the food overpriced. Inside, the decor reminds me of a hospital - everything is painted in boring white with not a lot of thought put into it. I also found the place very pretentious and that's just not what I'm looking for when I want a bite to eat and a cold beer on a patio.  The WORST thing about House/Maison are the menus. I see where they were going with the English/French part, but the print layout is AWFUL and impossible to read and the upside-down text really doesn't help. It's a nice thought but very poorly executed.  I'm going to give this place another try in a few months to see if it improves, but will be steering clear for now."}
{"text":"Best food I've ever had in Toronto.  I'm in love. I could eat here every day. I had the mussels the brussel sprouts and smashed potatoes."}
{"text":"This place rules.  So nice outside, chill atmosphere and great good.  Really just the nicest place in the village.  And the DJ setup is great!  Definitely go - it's plain old cool.  Waiter Kyle is awesome, too!! :-)"}
{"text":"Great new spot...   I went with a party of three on a Tuesday night... The patio is awesome and very chic, star points for the atmosphere which is great.  We had a few drinks on the patio and ordered a few things.  It got chilly so we moved inside and were just as impressed with the decor.    The drinks were delish - a little over priced but that's the move these days in Toronto I guess... 12 $ cocktails? hmmm - the beer was more reasonable though the selection is not great.   The food - we ordered the burger, the grilled cheese, and the lobster rolls as well as some onion rings...  The rings were awesome the perfect mix between crunchie and greasy.   The grilled cheese or Press as they call it certainly is a grilled cheese press (though it needed to be pressED) great bread but if it was hit with the spatuala and grilled a little longer it'd be perfect.   The lobster rolls were great - but the bread on this needs to be toasted or something... gets soggy real fast  The burger was amazing - just a goey mess of awesomenesss -   The server could have told us that two of our meals came with french fries and thus eliminated the need for us to get onion rings / we could have swapped.  other than that this place will survive and prosper... great new addition and will just get better with time."}
{"text":"Have been here twice now - first when it just opened and again recently for drinks with old colleagues. Definitely a very cool spot with beauuuutiful and interesting decor. A few things worth mentioning:  1) Both times I came it was really quiet, which is nice if you are going on a date with a longtime friend or bf but could be awkward on a first date. Given I came both times around 6/6:30 so maybe it gets busy later  2) Food is pretty pricy for what you get and the drinks add up too - not a cheap date.  3) Menu had changed since I first went and very few vegetarian options although the staff/chefs seemed nice so I am sure they could prepare something upon request. In fact, they had taken a favourite drink off the menu the second time around so I asked if they could make it and they obliged.  Overall, worth checking out, but not a 'go-to' spot."}
{"text":"We we decided to try their BRUNCH - disappointed in the selections for breakfast options as their was no Eggs Benny or even eggs and bacon. There was French Toast, Frittata with grilled vegetables, Steak & Eggs (which had Hollandaise on it, so why not offer a Benny ?), and granola with fruit.    We ordered French Toast (nothing to write home about as I can make it better), Steak & Eggs (which apparently was very nice), fish & chips (which looked and tasted very nice even though we had no idea what the fish was)  The service was so-so, typo's on the menu and truthfully we waited over 40 minutes for our order. So------not sure if I want to try another dinner at House Masion....I don't think I could take the disappointment.   Owners if your reading this, I was so stoked when you opened another beautiful place on the street to enjoy however there was five of us and the fifth didn't order anything since you had no basics for brunch such as eggs Benny or even bacon and eggs. A little disappointing !"}
{"text":"Great experience. Friendly staff, nice vibes & great steak!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and interior decor. The waiters are very friendly and helpful. For brunch, I tasted their Pain Perdu which is their take of French  toast. The portion is large and the food is delicious. Highly recommend it for outing. They also have a great patio."}
{"text":"House/Maison is a welcome new entrant to the Church Street dining scene.  It's a huge step up from the awful Vic that occupied this location previously.  The food is decent, the patio is excellent, and they're still finding their legs a bit.  The FOOD:  I got the grilled calamari ($16) which had generally quite a nice flavor and was well-cooked, however, the portion was disappointingly tiny.  My friends all had the burgers or club sandwiches, which were quite the opposite in portion size...huge sandwiches with tons of homemade fries.  Someone had clearly forgotten to season the fries that night, as I watched all my friends and all the other tables vigorously pump their salt shakers.  Alas, my dish was already too salty...harder to fix.  Mixed bag on the food....I think they're working some kinks out.  The SERVICE:  Our waitress was very nice and checked on us often at the start.  As it got busier, service tapered off a bit, but it wasn't bad.  Definitely some confusion amongst other servers and food runners.  The waitstaff is totally incongruous due to their gimicky theme.  Half of the restaurant is \"Maison\", meant to be more formal, and the staff dress like proper staff all in black.  The other half, where we were seated is \"House\", which is meant to be informal, and the staff dress inappropriately in flannel and cut-off shorts.  The food and beverage menus are exactly the same, so this ends up being a bit of visual dissonance, and frankly the informal is too informal for the pricepoint here.  The ATMOSPHERE:  Killer giant patio.  Inside is nicely renovated, replete with modern spare unfinished walls and floors and the typical sculptural Edison bulb light fixtures.  Music was moderately loud on arrival, conversation was reasonably possible; however, it got bumped up way too loud for a dinner joint before we left and hastened our departure.  The DRINKS:  Looks like a good cocktail menu, but we didn't try any this time.  Decent wine list by the glass & the bottle.  Beer menu is a bit too standard...they could step that up a bit to match the more adventurous food.     OVERALL, I enjoyed eating here.  It's definitely the best food one can find on a patio in the Village...even with the mistakes it blows Hair of the Dog, O'Grady's, and the Churchmouse out of the water.  I look forward to seeing their food and service improve.  Let's hope they solicit feedback and incorporate it."}
{"text":"A perfect date spot.  We were impressed right from the beginning. The host (Stephen) found a seat for us on the cool patio where we could tie our dog up beside us and even gave our dog a bowl of water.  The aesthetic was chic and sexy. I ordered a bourbon house cocktail that was delicious and very pretty.  My wife and I were ready to give this place five stars as long as they didn't mess up the mains, and they didn't. I had the burger and my wife had the fish and chips and we were both delighted with our meal.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Not a place to book an event - I have emailed twice and called three times to no avail. I am simply trying to get a quote to book an event for 50 people and you would think someone would have the decency to call me back. Instead, I spoke to someone who said they could not do anything for me. Wow. Moving on."}
{"text":"Big flop on Church. Four stars for venue, 1 for service. The venue is very hip, up-scale, almost Ritz-Carlton like. Service, however, is a complete disaster. You usually see 4-5 people serving the same person; every one wears different hats. Just a mess. Haven't tried the food, but looking at the prices on the menu will make you want to puke. The prices are ridiculously high for drinks and for food. The same owners here also own Smith's across the street. Management, please get your act together. And thanks for finally fixing your menus. Nobody, I mean nobody, could read those upside down French words and English words at the same time. Overall a 2 star experience: too pricy for venue eye candy. Servers and bartender were not attentive at all. Ignore all those 5 star reviews from people who've written 1 review, clearly from employees."}
{"text":"Bad drinks and bad service.  Tried to charge us for a drink that was sent back because it was not made right and we had to argue with management about removing it from the bill.  Really surprised by the horrible management of a place that gets good reviews."}
