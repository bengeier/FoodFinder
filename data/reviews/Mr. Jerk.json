{"text":"had the lunch special chicken, rice and slaw. In my opinion, quite a tasty option for those who like jerk flavour. Price is good also. Lunch special and a pop and it came to around 8 buck. Decent price for the portion that you get. Would go back."}
{"text":"I wasnt impressed by the service or the food,i reccomend that they get a new chef"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. I am not going to lie. It looked very sketchy from the outside. Piles of 'stuff' piled in one of the windows. I thought perhaps they had closed?? But tried the door and it was open.
The gentleman was super friendly and immediately gave me a piece of the jerk pork to try. It was amazing! So I bought a pound of pork and a half chicken to go. 
Fed three of us well, it was very tasty. I would give the food and service 5 Stars, but just can't get past the cleanliness of the place. 
I will return though, it was that good."}
{"text":"Food is overcooked! Owner has no manners and treat customers with attitude and no respect. I wonder how this place and still be open and looks dirty inside! Bugs flying... Beware! Had also stomach ache today!."}
{"text":"The people there are friendly. The food is really good! One of the best Jerk Chicken I ever ate. I don't usually eat spicy food because I can't handle it. The only spicy foods I eat are good food!

Yay, the chicken is a bit dry but overall everything was really good. Reason why I say one of the best chicken I ever ate? Well, usually when you eat something spicy it hit you in a second however I ate a couple of bite and nothing.... BAM my mouth was going crazy! 
 It's good to really taste the flavor of the meat before you feel nothing in your mouth."}
{"text":"Wish I could provide a full rating based on food taste and quality but it was not meant to be.....saturday night online shows that they open until 7pm, called ahead at 6pm to make sure they still had some oxtail....someone picks up the phone and said that they were not opened today......why have a business when you don't want to open to serve and make money?

Explain to me why 95% of any caribbean resturants in Ontario is closed early or don't want to open at all?   The quality and taste can't make up for the lack of will with regards to work ethic from the owners and employees at caribbean restaurants.

Seems like you don't have to lose my business since you are not opened for business.

P.S. no caribbean resturants in Ontario want to be opened for business on Sundays either."}
{"text":"Really great Roti!  The shop is a bit messy but overall nice size portions and friendly service."}
{"text":"Excellent jerk chicken rice with good portions. Jerk chicken not too dry, very moist and tender. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Honestly,It is average compared to other location where you could get authentic real jerk, they have a daily special from 11am - 3pm for $7 which is not bad but again food is average (jerk is dry) and the place does not look sanitary. Reason why I am giving this place a low rating is like what most ppl say. The owner has no respect for his customers and treats them with attitude and no class, for the lower than average quality of food and ambience of the store you would expect better customer service but nope. I would not recommend this place, I rather drive an extra 30 mins to another decent jerk restaurant in scarborough or ajax area than here."}
{"text":"Mr Jerk, food is dry and bland. The place looks dirty and messy. The Asian guy that works there is rude and unprofessional. I walked in and all the Asian guy did was complain about his sister who owns the place. Saying how she flies all over the world and he is stuck there working. If you are the owner of this restaurant understand that your brother complains about you to very customer that walks in the door. He does not enjoy working for you, and if u keep him employed your business is going to close up shop very soon....

 Customer ahead of me asked for coleslaw and he said his wife didn't come to work today and he was working by himself ......so no coleslaw....

The experience was not good, disgruntled employee (brother) shows in his service,food and attitude."}
{"text":"I selfishly don't want people to know about this place because the jerk and poutine was that good.  Would have rated it a 5 if the wait wasn't so long.  On the other hand, it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Decent jerk chicken and rice with gravy. friendly service in this small takeout place. Price is reasonable for quantity and quality."}
{"text":"Their oxtail is extremely delicious! It's always flavorful and tender. This is the only place I go to for Caribbean food."}
{"text":"It's a little weird that I give a 3 star rating to my jerk@hwy 7 and don mills gets 5 stars. With the exception of a better and bigger store, food wise, everything else is a notch below the don mills branch. 
-smaller portion sizes
-different coleslaw for some reason
-rice and gravy slightly different
-even the combos offered aren't the same

mr jerk@don mills rules!"}
{"text":"Loooooooooove it !!!! Love love love! Try the stunning delicious oxtail - it's my favorite - how is it possible they can make it that tender ????? Love the chicken curry as well !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Never had an issue with this place. Service is pretty fast and the owner is usually on site during the day. Good guy, always cracking jokes etc.... Their Ingredients are always fresh and moist. Love the jerk chicken sandwich and coleslaw! Yum yum!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Friendly staff, great prices and most importantly, tons of flavour!

I heard about this place from a client so decided to take the plunge. Funny, I've lived in Markham for 30+ years and never heard of this place until a few days ago.  I forsee becoming a regular here, great food!"}
{"text":"I have always been a bigger fan of oxtail than jerk chicken/pork when it comes to Jamaican food. I've tried all 3 at this place and in terms jerk, I like the chicken more than the pork. Make sure you ask them to slather on some oxtail sauce on your meat to keep it moist. I haven't tried their lunch specials but their dinner portions are pretty good. It's one of the few Jamaican places in Markham so it does get busy some nights. The older couple runs the shop themselves so the wait time varies. I didn't give a perfect rating because of the location and the fact that they don't offer aki fish (another one of my favs).  They do have several other dishes on the menu but man if they could serve aki fish and do it well. I would be more than happy to give then 6 stars."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been here and I still remember driving by when they were almost open when visiting my parents in Markham and getting excited.  This is your no fuss, quick, Jamaican food joint.

I've been to Mr. Jerk in the peanut plaza many times.  This place may eclipse it in quality (I've also been to the wellesley one, meh) .  The jerk pork here really can't be beat.  Some say it's on the dry side, but I think it's delicious and the perfect amount of spice.  Add a patty for a snack later and you can't go wrong.  I've also tried the jerk chicken which is good, but I prefer fried chicken and my heart is with the pork here.  I haven't had better jerk pork even at dine in restaurants!  The one gripe I do have is the coleslaw is pretty bland.

Last time I drove by, I saw they opened up a chinese take-out restaurant beside it.  Interesting."}
{"text":"Love their jerk pork. We usually get a pound of jerk pork with  the jerk pork dinner or lunch.  The pound of jerk pork is great for snacking on through out the day."}
{"text":"Don't eat there, flies flying in store and bad customer service. The Chinese dude has no sympathy for customer eating there, no manner and basically treat customer like sh*t!!!! Attitude this guy in telling you. Can I ask for a beef patty? His reply we only sell beef patty, next time don't say the beef word, just say patty! Teach u how to talk! Like what the heck man!!!! This owner does not deserve your business with this Atticus and this place needs to be shut down by Municipality. All dishes are gross!!!"}
{"text":"The service and food was very good. It felt like family when I was in there and they have a great variety of Caribbean dishes as well as Chinese food at one point. Not sure if they are still making the Chinese food. This is good place to checkout if you a Caribbean carving."}
{"text":"Great food, great lunch specials, nice & friendly staff! Great place for fast lunch take out in Markham."}
{"text":"I  was hesitant to  go  because  all the  reviews  talk  about  the  Jerk, and  it's  the  curry I was  wondering  about .   There  was no curry chicken  left, which  is  probably  a  good  sign ,  so   I  had the  curry goat , it was great.  I  will  have  to  get  there a little  earlier  next time ,  so I  can  try the  chicken ."}
{"text":"I agree with most foodies here; the food is very tasty but the customer service is awful! 9 out 10 times, they are 30 - 40 minutes late in opening the store. Hungry people are waiting outside knocking on the store front windows in attempts to try to catch their attention to open up the door so at least they can walk in instead of waiting outside yet they don't even acknowledge. I don't know if they deaf or just straight up rude. If they are planning to open up late then I suggest you to change your store hours to 12pm instead of 11am! 
Also, the store needs to be cleaned up. They have unused furniture and all kinds of crap lying around that has no relation to the restaurant! What the heck?"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as I'm eating my take out lunch from Mr.Jerk.

I ordered the Jerk pork meal and it came with bean mixed w/rice, cabbage and the jerk pork. The flavours are good (would like more sauce) the pork is very dry and hard/chewy and too skinny (not enough fatty parts) causing it to be dry and hard to chew. the rice is hard, maybe undercooked, and no flavour except for the sauce, which was only on the top. The portions is good. The pork isn't very good but I would come back again and give the other meats a try such as the jerk chicken, curries, oxtail...

the beef patty crust is kind of hard and not as flaky/smooth/soft, it's the same shape as allen's pastries but I'm not sure if it is the same cause I only have the curry goat from Allen's. The crust at Mr.Jerk was not buttery soft/flaky and the beef filling was really salty. It's not horrible but not the best of course.

It's a good location and I would come back and try the other stuff. The parking is OK, and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Friendly staff that will tell you what is popular and serve with a smile.

I chose the jerk pork, a bit dry, but well spiced.  The ox tail was perfect.  Very impressed."}
{"text":"Went in and wanted to order a lot of food. Found out food is sold out and only left with 2 items.

Please next time know how busy things can get and make more food."}
{"text":"Tried the jerk chicken and pork in a few applications.  Chicken was moist and flavourful. The pork was tender and juicy (ask for the fattier pieces). Best jerk I've had within 30 minute radius."}
{"text":"Never will I go back here. I called ordered stew chicken and curry chicken. I get to the place , 3 people in front of me, so I wait inline. After waiting half hour finally they serve me. I tell the lady I called for the pick up and the food isn't even ready. Although they were friendly, I was very disappointed in the service. The curry chicken was decent, but the stew chicken wasn't that good. It was really dark looked more like jerk chicken. The rice was excellent. But I will not be returning to mr jerk."}
{"text":"Went for lunch here today and was very pleased.  Once we walked in we noticed the lunch special, $4.99 for jerk chicken or pork.  Now you probably think you would get a small portion but nope it was a regular sized dinner meal for half the price pretty much.  The staff was really friendly to the point where we were cracking jokes back and forth.  Brought the jerk pork back to the office and yup it was exactly what I thought...goodness.  Pork was tender but slightly over seasoned but mixed with the slaw and rice you will be in for a treat.  Will be going back here for sure with that special."}
{"text":"I asked for a curry goat dinner and my friend ordered a lunch special. Super reasonable price, both with so much meat!!!!!"}
{"text":"I usually get the lunch speical which is 7 dollars for either jerk chicken or pork with rice(available from 11 to 2 i think lol) . Today i went there and tried out their large oxtail dinner, cost me 16 dollars and i didnt regret my decision. The oxtail sauce on the rice is so creamy and the ox tail is so flavorful. Remember to ask for extra sauce on rice."}
{"text":"Great value and delicious!  Pork is so flavourful and is a quality barbecue. Jerk chicken is great as well.  A must try if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Overall - Great place to grab food during lunch time and get out. Service is terrible but I guess you can't win em all. 

Service: 2/5 - The Chinese guy serving the food is extremely rude and sassy - avoid interaction with him. Haven't had any experience with the other people working there, but he seems to be the one working there the majority of the time. 

Food: 4/5 - The Jerk Chicken there is really nice and juicy. The peas and rice are also great. That's really all you need to know about the place.

Price: 4.5/5 - If you go during lunch I believe the Jerk Chicken Dinner is only $7-8, which is super cheap for a full meal. It is also really filling. At other times the price is reasonable/cheap compared to other places that you could go and get that good and filling of a meal."}
{"text":"Must try: Jerk Pork

The Jerk Pork is so moist and tender that the pieces fall apart on your fork..... The lunch special is great at $6.20 for the dinner size portion.

When asked \"Do you want gravy on your ________?\", the answer is always \"yes\". Always."}
{"text":"Split review for a Jerk Pork Lunch Special ($6.2 + tax)

Jerk Pork: 4 stars
Rice: 3 stars
Price: 5 stars
Value: 3 stars

The only fair way that I can review Mr. Jerk's Jerk Pork lunch special is to provide a split rating.

Jerk pork: The jerk pork, as many have mentioned, was moist, tender, tasty, and had a nice charred skin.  Why not 5 star for the meat?  Well, it didn't taste jerk to me.  It was not spicy or spiced.  If you wanted it hot, ask for extra sauce over the meat.

Rice: Why is there a separate review for the rice?  Because most of the lunch box was filled with rice.  The rice was good.  It was very well portioned.  I just can't 4 or 5 star rice cooked in flavored water.

Price:  $6.20 can get you an overall well portioned lunch.  I call it inexpensive.  It costs slightly more than a wonton soup noodle, but Mr Jerk is a take out joint, so you don't have to tip.  The total cost works out rather similar.  Now you have a clearer idea how competitively priced the lunch special is even in Markham.

Value:  Yes, you will get full with this meal.  Yes, there was enough jerk pork in the lunch box.  The box was still 90% filled with rice plus salad.  So as far as value is concern, I call it fair.  Not exceptional, not a great deal, but a very fair deal.  Fair to the seller and the buyer.

Overall: I lean towards 3.5 stars for food and value.  But hey, the people at counter are down to earth, have a good attitude, just want to make an honest living with honest food  This place is popular, swamped with line up at lunch time.  So I feel generous.  4 stars that is."}
{"text":"Everyone had something to say about the gentleman at the front and his bad humour. Blah blah. Just giggle and move along. He isn't being rude, he is trying to make you laugh, you Sour Patch Kids. 

The point is the FOOD. It's important to me that my food is HOT. The taste is definitely 100/10 but it loses 2 stars because my rice & peas were below room temp. Such a shame because damn... The coconut flavour in the rice was so distinct, the jerk pork was crunchy on the outside and just moist on the inside, I opted for the curry potatoes and WOW just cooked to perfection. My friend got the jerk chicken leg and it was fall off the bone moist, and the steamed veg (mostly cabbage) was cooked perfectly with a slight crunch. That HOT SAUCE Though ... Anyone who knows Carribean food knows that the homemade hot sauce is important. Mr Jerk's hot sauce has a very different taste to it. It was nice and tangy with a PUNT (not a kick, weary hearts beware). 

They have the 11-3 lunch special which would have made the meal a little worth it but all-in-all great flavour. Good portions. Everyone should just go get their food and eat it elsewhere if they don't want to deal with the \"attitude.\""}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating here! Had it a bunch of times and it's always good and consistent! Prices are very reasonable, good size portions! Jerk pork is also amazing! Guy behind the counter is really nice and friendly as well! I live nearby so I go pretty often and it's always good!"}
{"text":"While going to the historic Main Street in the 18th century Victorian village of Unionville located in Markham in the Greater Toronto Area, we stopped for lunch at a nearby hole-in-the-wall restaurant, Mr Jerk  (I love the name of the restaurant!).  This restaurant, which serves mainly authentic Caribbean and a few Chinese entrees, is a hidden gem!  It is mostly take-out, although the restaurant has two counters with six bar stools where you can sit and dine in.  The interior of the restaurant is bright and clean and appears to be recently renovated.  Heard that they also do catering for special events.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mr-jerk-markham?select=Mykf2EIJYQ43Nc8Sg7cirQ

Their jerk pork and jerk chicken are sooooo delicious - spicy, juicy, and moist with the right amount of seasonings!  Their lunch special is a bargain at $5.95 and is available from 11am to 3pm; it comes with jerk pork or a quarter leg of jerk chicken, rice, and cole slaw or steamed veggies.  Their spices, gravies, and sauces are really tasty!  There are also dinner specials from 3p to closing.  While we were there, the cornbread had just gotten out of the oven, and it was so tasty that it just melted in your mouth!  Likewise, we also got the fried chicken as it just came out of the fryer - hot, crunchy, and so moist on the inside!  In addition to their jerk chicken and jerk pork, they also serve curries, rotis, beef patties, stews, fish, desserts (festival, fried plantain, puddings, and others); and Caribbean drinks.  Portions are generous, and the prices are reasonable.  Will have to go back to try the different things.  

The staff is very cordial and patient in explaining the different food items, especially if you're not familiar with Caribbean food.  They don't rush you to order, although you feel kinda bad when there are people in line behind you knowing exactly what they want to order and wanting to order right away.

There are a few designated parking spaces that are solely for restaurant patrons conveniently located right in front of the restaurant.

Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Best jerk pork I've ever had, hands down. Availability of sides is inconsistent. Tidyness of restaurant could be a little better."}
{"text":"Although it's so close to me, I don't think I will ever coming back..

Ordered a Large OxTail Rice and Peas and a Beef Patty. Costed $16.25.

The OxTail was not tender enough at all!! Regular food court quality.. Small portions.. The gravy was running like water..

Rice and Peas didn't taste good either, the rice was flaky and powdery.. There was no gravy in the rice because the was gravy watery..

Beef Patty ($1.50) tasted cheap, literally no meat inside, wasn't crispy. Tasted mostly like moist beef patty doe.

Looked at the Jerk Chicken, it looked stale.. Would prefer to go to a food court Caribbean Restaurant over Mr Jerk.. The Sunrise chain is definitely a better choice over this..

Place was dirty and old, which i don't mind because sometimes you find awesome food..

Service wasn't all that particularly good either.. Also, a small OXTail dinner would have been $11.50 plus tax which would have been a complete rip off..

Definitely don't think this place deserves the current 4 star rating  I usually don't put 1 star ratings.. But I feel like giving this place 1 star because I had higher expectations for a 4 star restaurant. Either way, this place would get a 2 star max rating from me..

If you can, go to Chris Jerk at Birchmount and Huntingwood!! You will notice a obvious difference in food quality, taste, service for the same price!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick bite.

After coming back from a vacation in Jamaica, I found myself craving some jerk chicken. Looked around Markham and found this gem. Lunch portions are affordable and generous. Be warned that as there is a high school close by, so they get quite busy during lunch time. Most people do choose takeout, but there is are a couple of window seats for those who wish to dine in.


Parking is a little challenging as Mr. Jerk is location in a strip plaza on Hwy 7. 
*Note that there is more parking in the back."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that if you only care about the food and don't mind being ignored and forgotten after you've paid, this place is alright. We ordered a half chicken dinner and were told that it would be about a 15 minute wait, so we got a sandwich to eat while we waited. 45 minutes later, we were still chickenless, so I went up to inquire. There was already a long line at it's point, but the owner was on the phone talking to someone else, and didn't make any attempt to acknowledge the customers. Everyone was grumbling and several people had already left in frustration, but I already paid so I didn't have that luxury. After another 20 min, the guy at the back came out and finally started taking orders, and prepared my order. Now here is the worst part, the owner REFUSED to let me have my food, even though I already paid for it an hour ago... Until he was off the phone and had taken the orders of everyone in front of me. He then had the audacity to call me \"impatient\" in front of his coworker and the other customers. My one consolation? Another pissed off customer chiming in \"He SHOULD be impatient\" as I left with my food. Highly doubt I'll be back after this rude lesson in terrible customer service.

Food was pretty good though, so +1 star for that."}
{"text":"Came here to pick up lunch, I got the jerk chicken. The food is 3 stars, the chicken was pretty dry. It'll satisfy your Caribbean craving but I wouldn't drive out of my way to go here. I gave it 4 stars cause the man who helped me was really friendly."}
{"text":"I wanted to see what the hype was all about... but was extremely disappointed. I ordered the jerk chicken leg special and it just didn't have the kick I was anticipating. I know they say most places that look grungy usually are the best for food but this place was an absolute dump. You'll receive way better quality and flavour at Tastee!"}
{"text":"I have driven by the Hwy 7 location for years but never managed to venture in as it looked a bit oldish on the outside. But don't let that fool you - inside there is some delicious jerk pork and chicken. We also right by a George's Tasty patty which I found their pork to be flavourful but dry.

Once inside, we were greeted by a friendly guy who offered us some jerk pork samples just to see \"what its all about\". On the outside, pork had a nice flavour and inside was soft - we were sold and ordered:

Jerk pork dinner with steam veggie and rice - Initially, we were going to ask for gravy on it but we followed his recommendation of not to use gravy to fully taste the pork. That was a great idea as we loved combo of strong jerk pork with mild carrot and cabbage with the rice and beans. Great combo and would order it again.

Jerk chicken dinner with steam veggie and rice - We also ordered the half chicken dinner and wow - I think the chicken is even better. The white meat of the chicken was a bit dry but the dark thigh and leg mean - awesome! I think next time we would probably order 2 leg dinners inside as the the dark meat is much more flavourful.

We have found a new fav jerk place!"}
{"text":"I never heard of Mr. Jerk till the night when I was eating at Puck'n Wings across the street. Mr. Jerk took over the old Holy Chow location and it really the only Caribbean takeout of any kind in the immediate area that I know of.

The lady that greeted me is nice and friendly but with a really heavy caribbean accent.. We have to both repeat everything that we said to each other before we got an idea what we talking about.. Chinese Accent VS Island Accent! :)

Jerk Chicken Leg Dinner ($5.50)
- I was a little bit disappointed with the Jerk Chicken. Usually I pick the leg part because it usually not as dry and more juicy. However, I have to say that it is dry and tough.... it resembles more of a \"Jerky\" Chicken than a Jerk Chicken
- For side you can pick either a veggie or coleslaw. Veggie is a combination of cabbage and carrot.. plain and simple but nice and healthy
- The rice is the star of this meal as me and my friends fighting to eat the rice.. good mix of kidney beans and some gravy to give it a little kick

Can I dare to say I was a little disappointed with the Jerk Chicken at Mr Jerk? It is one of the worse one I ever have. 

BTW, my friends were really hesitate to eat the Jerk Chicken because it was like black... looks like it was really burnt.. I have to explain to them those are just the spice rub they use :).

Lunch specials for students $2 for a beef patty and a pop... I wonder if she will ask me for ID if I order one of those? :)

2.5 star"}
{"text":"Came here today for some jerk chicken. Upon walking in I noticed this place is pretty small. Not much in house seating. Place looked dated, but I could see an effort has been made to update it (new paint, flat screen tv etc). 

Onto the food. The chicken was friggin' delicious. It was moist, fresh and the jerk seasoning was on point. The chicken literally fell off the bones for me. Got the rice and steamed veggies (cabbage/carrots) as my sides and they were also great. Rice a little dry, didn't get any sauce, but still great. 

Drinks are not part of the dinner combo, nor were the patties. The patties are from Allan's pastry (check my review for them on my profile). They make a mean Jamaican patty. 

Anyways, moving on..this place is good. Gentleman working the counter let me try the pork and that was also on point as well. 

I would definitely return and spread the word for people who have never been here. 

3/5 for me. Peace!"}
