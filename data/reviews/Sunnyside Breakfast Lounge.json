{"text":"i brought my wife and children here for a family meal. The food is awesome and the service is very personal. This will now be our family weekly outing. Thank you Gab for such grate service and making us feel like part of your family."}
{"text":"Very good food- Chorizo Benedict is very tasty and made to perfection! Only downfall- orange juice is $5 without refills."}
{"text":"My PCH Benedict was excellent! The hollandaise sauce was about the best I've ever had - light and just the right amount of lemon. Loved the salmon with capers combo.  I substituted fruit for the home fries which made for a lighter meal."}
{"text":"Love this place. Funky atmosphere... Good food good service! Try the French toast... Very tasty!"}
{"text":"Awesome natural energy-boosting juices, perfect crispy bacon, friendly service. I've found my new favorite local breakfast diner."}
{"text":"I came in and was promptly greeted and seated. The menu had plenty of options along with a fresh pressed juice/smoothie menu. I ordered a rocky point omelette. I am gluten and dairy free, which they ha a menu for but I did not order from. The omelette was pretty good. What was lacking was the \"homefries.\" Everything tasted fresh but there were fried potatoes on my plate that looked and tasted like it came from a fast food establishment. I also ordered a Rejuvinator juice. It was ok. Nothing I would rave about. There was a bit too much celery and it overpowered everything else. I would probably give them a second try if I am ever back out this way."}
{"text":"Really great food and an awesome Bloody Mary.  So tastey. Bathe service is great.  I really enjoy sitting at the bar or on the patio.  They make great breakfast."}
{"text":"As a 15+ year resident of Las Sendas I've seen breakfast places come and go from the NE corner of Power and McDowell. And I could never understand why they couldn't last in an affluent area of Mesa with literally no competition. Then Sunnyside came and I realized what others had been lacking - mimosas and bloody mary's served alongside decent breakfast comfort food.  My husband and toddler have enjoyed Sunnyside since they've opened - until today. I even overlooked the one time they forgot about us for over 40 minutes because they were understaffed. This morning though once the bill came and I handed the server our card she spent over 10 minutes and 3 credit card terminals trying to force our card through. The card wasn't declining, their system was down. The server instead blamed our type of card as a reason for the fault and then asked me to go to the CVS to get payment.  I come from the customer service industry, I have made a career supporting and serving others and the golden rule in the service industry is 'the client is always right' especially in an instance where the client actually was in the right! Rather than blame my card the waitress should have said her system was down and asked if I could return with another form of payment.   Thanks Sunnyside for making me realize driving the extra few miles to Gilbert is worth it for better service."}
{"text":"So so so good! We get the egg white omelettes and they even have curly fries available for breakfast lol"}
{"text":"Food was amazing and the staff was super friendly. Ordered a screwdriver and got an orange juice with a splash of vodka. My only complaint, which makes me sound like an alcoholic but that's what Sunday mornings are made for!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! I posted the waffle pancake glorious thing on my plate!!! Not sure of the bad reviews, but this gem I good! My little secret..."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! Food was perfectly cooked. Great selection of food! Didn't feel rushed to order or eat. Would definitely go there again if I am on that end of town!"}
{"text":"Great place. Great service.  Had delicious breakfast today served by very friendly server, Krista. Unfortunately the hours posted on the website are not accurate,  and we arrived 15 minutes prior to actual opening.  Owner needs to fix that!"}
{"text":"Today we visited Sunnyside Breakfast Lounge & overall we enjoyed what we got. My husband got the chicken fried steak & said it was the best he'd ever had. I don't remember the name of my meal, but it was eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes & a biscuit with gravy. Their gravy is wonderful!! My daughter got the berry crape & she enjoyed it but thought there was way too much whipped cream.  I think we have found a new breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Had the ranch house Benedict and was very happy with it. Tasted great and the serving filled me up. Service was very quick and staff were all very friendly. Will be back."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast / lunch restaurants in town.  the Chef, Gabriel is as comfortable greeting guests as he is wiping down counters not to mention creating the delicious offerings.  If you haven't tried it yet you should it's personal service and delicious food done right."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I feel like great places deserve recognition. The drinks are fantastic, food is fantastic and the entire staff is great. I highly recommend and will refer everyone i know. The atmosphere may be the best ive been around. All around i wish i could give more than 5 stars. You will not be diappointed."}
{"text":"At this posting, Sunnyside Breakfast Lounge had only been open for three weeks.  It appeared that the staff was been able to work-out most of the \"new restaurant\" bumps-in-the-road.    My party of four arrived at 10 AM on a Sunday morning.  The first wave of the \"after-church\" crowd were arriving and, about 60-70% of the tables were full.  The hostess indicated that we would be seated within 5-10 minutes, however, we were taken to our table within 2-3 minutes.  Our server greeted us within 3-4 minutes and took our beverage orders.  Coffee and water were very quickly served. The coffee was flavorful, hot and much better than what we have been served in many other restaurants. Our initial cup of coffee was poured and a carafe of coffee was placed on the table. If there were any specials, we were not notified of them.    The menu contained a wide variety of innovative breakfast and lunch entrees.  Many of the dishes have a southwestern flavor with distinctive ingredients, e.g. napalitos (prickly pear cactus pads). The prices are competitive. A diner who drinks only one cup of coffee might find the $2.25 charge excessive.  Our server did tell us that the restaurant also offers a create-your-own omelet option, which was not on the menu.    Our server was attentive, friendly, willing to accommodate a special order (substituting a portobello mushroom for the meat in an egg entree), and kept our coffee and water containers full.  The quality of service we received from her was superior for this type of restaurant and indicative of her having been a server for over ten years.  Our entree order consisted of the PCH Benedict (shared), the Chorizo Benedict (with the portobello substituted for the chorizo), and a burger.  Our server asked the needed questions to ensure that food arrived as desired, e.g. how would you like the eggs in the Benedict cooked?  Our entrees arrived within 10-12 minutes, which was an acceptable time period for us.  The shared dish was split in the kitchen, which was appreciated and is becoming very unusual for restaurants in this price range.  The restaurant does not charge for splitting an order.  Our egg and burger dishes were prepared as ordered and served hot.  The whites of the poached eggs were fully cooked.  The Hollandaise sauce was smooth and creamy with a light yellow and opaque color.  The seasoned fries were firm, hot, flavorful without being overly spicy.  The peppered red potatoes were firm (perhaps, slightly undercooked) and had distinctive, but pleasurable flavor.  Our server checked-back with us several minutes after we were served. The discount coupon we presented was honored without any problems and our server pointed-out to us the credit on the bill.  While the restaurant has a few vegetarian breakfast and lunch entrees, they appear to be willing to accommodate modifications including substituting a portobello mushroom for the meat in egg and burger dishes.  Both the men's and women's restrooms were clean and well-stocked with supplies.  While our party thought that the restaurant would benefit from additional sound-absorbing material, we were able to adequately hear each other and the background noise did not significantly impact or ability to converse.  adorn The walls are adorned with two substantial murals and smaller nicknacks.   The Sunnyside Breakfast Lounge does have a Facebook page, but the menu is not posted.  If restaurant has a webpage, it was not listed within the first two pages of a Google search.  The latter situation needs to be resolved quickly by the restaurant owners.   I look forward eating at this restaurant again and exploring other menu offerings."}
{"text":"Great place. Friendly staff and always clean. Have been there about a half dozen times and yet to see or experience anything negative. Will definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"Delicious and hearty portions!  We came here after shooting at the range and it was great!  I had the salmon poached eggs with potatoes.  We also ordered Belgium waffles.  The waffles were ok, but I wish we got the pancakes instead.    Their coffee was great and we never had to ask for a refill.  I truly enjoyed brunch here and would recommend it to everyone.  Portions were great and they have options for everyone!  They even have a rewards program for each dollar you spend.    We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. The Bloody Mary's are to die for. I must say that the Bloody Mary's taste amazing here. The servers are phenomenal, and the Bartender that made our drinks was so sweet and we'll mannered. He was funny,professional, and speedy at making our drinks.We really liked his energy. I believe he told my husband his name was Oli. Our server was very professional and very punctual. We love this place and we will definitely be back for the food and ofcoarse the Bloody Mary's. Thanks Sunnyside for your awesome food, and service."}
{"text":"It was ok... I just went bc it was the only breakfast place in the area. Nice service is all they have going. Expensive and mediocre food at best."}
{"text":"I walked in and there was a person scrubbing floors in the kitchen where they were prepping food. That was really off-putting. But tried to be a good sport and ordered food anyway. Got a chicken sandwich and fries. The fries were good but the sandwich was incredibly bland. Husband had some pancakes which were decent but not good enough to come back."}
{"text":"A little disappointed given the positive reviews. I ordered the Chorizo Benedict. It was clear that the eggs were cooked in some sort of mold as they were literally flat on the bottom and were really rubbery. They were not cooked in water where they would have a much softer texture. When cutting into the egg, the yolk was closer to being that of a hard boiled egg. Although they still hard their orange hue, they were definitely overdone. The hollandaise sauce was....ok. Flavor was mediocre and it had started to congeal (might have been sitting for a bit before getting to my table?). The Chorizo on the other hand was full of flavor - had a kick to it so make sure  you're ok with a little spice before getting it. The pico-de-gailo was sparse - not much on my plate so can't really comment on that - which was disappointing. Last item on the plate was the home fries. They were ok as well. Would have liked them to have been cooked some more to gain a better crust on the outside. Not really seasoned and there weren't any onions. Can't say for certain but I'm not sure these were made fresh when I ordered (vs. having a batch sitting around that they microwaved for the plate - there certainly wasn't any gloss to them like you would normally see when you take fresh food right off the griddle or out of the pan where they had been just cooked in some butter/oil). Coffee was good.  Wife got The All American. Like my breakfast, her egg was overcooked and flat on the bottom so again, it looked like it was cooked in some sort of prefabricated mold vs. on the grill. She didn't care much for the gravy or the biscuit. I tasted both and to me they were ok. Not full of flavor but at least you didn't taste flour like at other places.  Our server was friendly, attentive - I never had an empty coffee cup. The place seemed clean and in good order. Wait on a Sunday around 10 a.m. was about 15 minutes.  With there being other items of interest on the menu, we would probably go back (but only with some sort of coupon) to give them a try. Hopefully they will have a better handle on cooking eggs....."}
{"text":"This place was gross. I got the french toast, with vegetables, & a side of fruit. The french toast was completely soggy, like it sat in the egg batter & barely got cooked. The fruits & vegetables I ordered were not very good either, and those should be hard to mess up. The fruit just needs to be served, there is no cooking, baking, sauteeing, or processing, just serve good, fresh fruit. Not exactly a cheap place to eat. The place was not busy, but I can see why after eating there just once I do not ever want to go back there again. This place is obviously in business for the money, to buy as cheap as they can, & sell as high as people will pay, not to offer good quality food that reflects the value of the price."}
{"text":"This was my first time here with my boyfriend and I have to say it was delicious!!! The portions were good, enough to fill you up perfectly. I has the nopales (cactus) omelette, it was sooooo good. Everything tasted fresh. Even the side of fruit. The coffee was okay, too expensive for a small cup. A little far from the central cities but a good place to go if you're in the area! Our waiter Luis was very nice too, Five stars!!!!!"}
{"text":"Quick personable service. Omelette was exactly as described, and tasted just as good as it looked. Really loved the drink menu. Large selection of blended juices. I went with energy maniac and wish I could get mine at home to taste this good. Very clean and inviting atmosphere."}
{"text":"After reading reviews I figured I'd take my wife here for a nice relaxing brunch. I can honestly say this is the worst breakfast cafe I have ever eaten at. Every item, besides the potatoes, on both our plates were prepared very poorly. Hollandaise that was separated and with no flavor. Eggs undercooked. Soggy biscuits. Gravy had no flavor, was thick like puddy, and had no meat in it at all. Not only would I never go back but I'd highly suggest others skip it as well. Sadly hardees has better biscuits and gravy for a fraction of the cost."}
{"text":"Fabulous this is my favorite Gluten Free Vegan breakfast place in Mesa. It has the best service and amazing food."}
{"text":"The French toast is made with Hawaiian bread and is oh sooo good. The bacon is better than most breakfast restaurants, aside from Crackers who have the best bacon I've tasted."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the last 2 times we have been here the service had been rotten.  Very rude staff and I don't do many negative reviews. This is horrible because this was our favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"Had an excellent healthy breakfast this morning.  Had two eggs sunny side up, bacon, home fries and a crispy English muffin.  The food was very fresh. Received excellent service! I also enjoyed my never ending cup of coffee.  Thank you and I will be back."}
{"text":"The service is very, very slow, and this is a Thursday! I'm sitting at the counter and it took 20 minutes just to get a bloody mary. The chicken fried steak is unimpressive, gravy is bland. The employees are in no hurry to please, my server just gave me an excuse about being too busy, even though it's hardly full of patrons. Getting back to the very bland chicken fried steak, absolutely the worst I have had in like \"forever\"!!#. My recommendation is, save yourself the frustration and go to What the Hell bar on Main st. If you want a decent breakfast and bloody mary in a timely fashion!"}
{"text":"First impression, OUTSTANDING!  Although I have had one dining experience here, I can say unequivocally, I will be back. A welcome change to the many ho hum bacon and egg restaurants that are common place in Mesa. Staff were friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. The PCH eggs Benedict was excellent. The juices, while pricey, were worth it. I had the Hangover Cure and my gf had the Miss Peachy and we both loved them. The service was excellent and quick."}
{"text":"I went in there today for the 2nd time today , when i picked up my rolled up fork and knife a roach came out from it , i did not make a scene , i just got up and made server aware of what happened and showed her the roach i killed and stopped my order and walked out , i dont advise anyone to eat there , where theres 1 theres many more roaches . Im sorry to post this but its not a good place , i hate to see anyone get sick"}
{"text":"Went to this breakfast stop for the first time today. I like the atmosphere and service was great! Good job Tad! I ordered the Butchers omelette (I believe that was the title).  My husband ordered the biscuits and gravy. Potatoes were crisp and fresh, the coffee was hot, and the toast was good. With all that said, this will not be added to the list of breakfast places that we love unfortunately  The gravy was bland, the biscuits were boring and the omelette was pretty plain....I had to add a lot of salt to make it decent.  The carb filled potatoes, biscuits and toast were reviewed by my husband, as I do not eat any excess carbs and/or grains these days. Sorry Sunnyside, your location and service are top notch, but it's pretty hard to mess up breakfast in my opinion."}
{"text":"I love their eggs Benedict with salmon. So good. Service is always good & coffee's always getting refilled without having to ask."}
{"text":"Meals were fulfilling and taste was spectacular! Jose was our server was friendly, just lacked attentiveness. Might of been due to end of day. I would return and recommend to my friends/family."}
{"text":"Went here for Mother's Day with my mom and 3  kids. It was good, but nothing great. I prefer IHOP or Village inn over this place. None of us liked the orange juice and 4 of us ordered it. I did have my child's replaced, but the rest of us just drank our Coffee instead. If I would have known it was $5 for a glass of orange juice I would have had all of ours returned and refunded."}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast in north mesa, they have lots of natural juices and southern flavors mixed in the menu like the rocky point omelet with cactus...so good!!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place!!  Been coming here now for well over a year and it just keeps getting better!!  Friendly staff (especially love Jose) and always good food and great service  You are missing out if you haven\"t been here!  Check it out out!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love it!! Everyone there is always soo friggin nice too!! We love their breakfast burritos and go as often as we can! Oh and definitely reasonable prices too!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for a bagel breakfast sandwich. I was in a hurry and they put it together quick and in a nice to go container. The beacon egg and cheese sandwich was delicious and very filling. The cashier and waitress who helped me were nice attentive and helpful. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Best bloody mary and eggs benedict!  A perfect experience."}
{"text":"Moved out to mesa Arizona and found this place and its been my favorite for breakfast and bloody Mary's since, great food and staff"}
{"text":"Delicious! I flew in from Seattle looking for a bit to eat and I decided to try this little gem. I had the full garden omelette and a mimosa. So good! The service was also excellent."}
{"text":"I would think that a place called SunnySide would know how to make some simple fried eggs. I ordered my eggs over medium and they came out with very running egg whites. When i mentioned it to our waitress she said \"well that's our over medium,I can bring you some over hard\" and told her I did not want hard eggs, I just wanted the white cooked while the yolk was soft. Well she brought out new eggs, never took away my old plate, brought the new eggs on such a small plate that I couldn't even put my potatoes on the new plate if I tried. The new eggs were so hard they had to be cut with a knife.  I felt like going to the kitchen and showing them how to make a properly fried egg!"}
{"text":"Attentive service and seated quickly. The food was cooked as ordered and out within 10 minutes. Granted, I'm here on a weekday and it might be slow--but I appreciated the good service and food as ordered between appointments! I will be back."}
{"text":"1st good food, really good 2nd great service 3rd fair prices 4th dogs outside ok (truly pet friendly) What more do want?"}
{"text":"This place is too busy for their own good. The dining space feels cramped with too many tables in the available area. The wait staff is lost and we had to ask for silverware twice.  For 35.00 we got the Denver omelette, corned beef and hash (its out of a can and costs 10.00!), and a kids meal short stack. While they tout that they make make their own sausage and chorizo in house, the menu doesn't offer much focus on these ingredients.  Honestly, drive a few more miles and go to Crackers. You'll be much happier."}
{"text":"This is the 4th or 5th time I've been here. Never had a bad experience or bad service.  Servers are always helpful and very nice. (especially when you can't decide what you want to eat) We love the banana Nutella pancake but the crepe comes in a close second. (Which we share) Today I tried the chimi supreme. It was HUGE!! Very flavorful and so good! The chimi sauce was a little too spicy for me so I did push most of it off to the side (made my lips tingle). Sunnyside has never disappointed us.  Good food, good service and we love coming back."}
{"text":"Mediocre food at best and awful service. We waited almost 10 minutes before our waitress even came and got our drink order, mind you it wasn't super busy, our waitress was just no where to be found. Food was out quickly but everything had an odd flavor. I got the crab cakes Benedict and my husband got the chicken fried steak. My hollandaise was bland and crab cakes tasted premade and had an odd underlying flavor that I couldn't even finish. The home fries were ok, but also tasted frozen and not seasoned very well. My husband said his chicken fried steak was alright, the gravy had a weird flavor as did the eggs but he did manage to finish his. Waitress only checked on us once during the meal, very half heartedly, she was walking past and didn't even bother to stop just asked quickly if everything was fine while continuing to walk by and not waiting for a response. After we finished eating she came and got our plates and left our check, it then took her 5+ minutes before she came back to get the check. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I'm absolutely perplexed by this restaurant. Why is it always crowded? I've now visited twice for brunch and both times left disappointed. My family and I ordered the chilaquiles, chile verde omelette, kids pancakes, and kids french toast. First, the chilaquiles were bland, the only flavor coming from some chorizo I added (and paid extra for). No avocado, no fresh cilantro, no salsa. Chilaquiles should be spicy, bright, crunchy, and savory in my opinion. The chile verde omelette was similarly boring and the accompanying breakfast potatoes were inconsistently cooked. Both the kids pancakes and french toast were burnt and cold. We also asked for extra crispy bacon and it arrived extra wiggly instead. My husband and I left thinking, \"Why do the good people of NE Mesa tolerate this subpar food?\" Answer: there are no local alternatives. So sad."}
{"text":"The chicken fried steak is the best! I've been there a couple times and I love everything I've gotten BUT the service is not that great. That is why I have then 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"Sunday Who went to Sunnyside for breakfast I would've the biscuits and gravy and it was pretty much in edible service was good and the place has a cool vibe"}
{"text":"I was invited here and now I can't stop returning. I've even taken my kids several times, the food is just that good! The ambience is awesome, very warm and friendly. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best Bloody Mary I've had in a long time!!! Boom!!"}
{"text":"A great place to spend breakfast. Very friendly staff. We've been here three times and have chosen different items each time. All were very good. We've also tried a couple of the daily morning juices and they were delicious. Thanks for starting our day out right."}
{"text":"The food quality is always very good. I have had the French Toast with the berries and it's great.  The service is great also."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here with 24 people and I thought the service was top notch! The servers were very attentive. Love the food and service. Will definitely come back to try other items!"}
{"text":"This place was packed, was told it would be a twenty minute wait to be seated. Only waited maybe ten minutes and was seated. Drinks were served right away, our order was placed and brought right out a few minutes later. This place is on point and very quick. I will definitely be returning. The wait staff was extremely friendly and and the food was awesome! I'd give it ten stars if I could."}
{"text":"This place is quaint and very clean. My roommate and I ordered the \"Butchers Choice Omelette\" we were satisfied with what we ordered. We did agree next time we would add veggies because it was a little plain for our liking.   The service was prompt and friendly. Out coffees never ran low."}
{"text":"Pretty solid food. Can't go wrong with most of the menu. The smoothies are really good."}
{"text":"Overly priced food. Not impressed. French toast thin & limp. Bacon just regular not peppered or applewood. Charge extra for topping like fruit ontop instead of it being included. $14.00 spent for french toast & side of bacon. Will not recommend if  simply cant make a decent simple receipe."}
{"text":"Excellent place with a diverse menu, including a bar. Miso salad was excellent. Krista was our server and did a great job."}
{"text":"First time there.  My husband and I split the Chicken Fried Steak. We figured it would be a huge meal for $10.75 plus you have to pay $2.25 extra for toast.   Gravy was pasty and I had to ask for extra gravy to moisten the dry and obviously frozen potatoes.  Service was good and food came our fast, but we will probably not go back.."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Luis our server was great. Great looking decor and fresh food. They have great fresh squeezed juice and breakfast cocktails. Not a chain!"}
{"text":"Had a girl's brunch. Only one meal was worth ordering.  Then on our way out one of the employees was outside and started begging. He saw I was giving one of my friend some limes. He didn't ask just once, but begged. Not cool."}
{"text":"Service was amazing! Jamie was so sweet and took great care of us! The food was incredible we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What makes this place special is the high quality ingredients that go into every plate. It is an absolute treat to eat here. For the price you get a delicious, wholesome, fresh-made breakfast. The pancakes are a must-have. I love their regular buttermilk pancakes, but the specialty pancakes are killer too. I like the ones with bananas and nutella. Wow!!!  The staff is super friendly (ask for Jamie!) and goes out of their way to make you happy. I love, love, love this place. Oh, and you MUST get the bloody mary. (I'd sell my mother into slavery for one of these drinks.) I'm on my third as I write this."}
{"text":"A great place for breakfast.  The coffee is fresh and hot.  The servers make sure to keep your cup filled.  Pancakes are light and airy. The French Toast is delicious.  Thy also offer a 20% discount for a Yelp checkin."}
{"text":"Great service! We came in for a birthday celebration and they seated us outside on their beautiful patio. They were generous with their complimentary mimosa for the bday girl and made our brunch a comfortable one!"}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfasts and mimosas too. Love the corn beef hash and crab cake bennedict. Great service and staff."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for over three years..solid service yummy food...tasty and fresh!  Eggs Benedict with chorizo yes please!  Everything here that I have eaten has been wonderful and fresh. Servers are pleasant and friendly...try this place you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Had the corned beef hash and the crab cake eggs Benedict both amazing... staff was wonderful can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Sunnyside about 4-5 times now and I must say the service/quality of food has gotten worse every time. The food is very overpriced along with their drinks. $9 for French toast with no side. My husband ordered the heuvos rancheros and said that it had no flavor at all and therefor not enjoyable. Wait staff attitude is hit or miss. Overall, the $30 for French toast, crappy huevos rancheros, and one cup of coffee just isn't worth it. We will probably not be back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Always have a fantastic experience here for breakfast. Kids love coming and then we do a hike for a perfect day."}
{"text":"Delicious options for breakfast/brunch! We've been twice in the last 3 days just so I could get a little more off the menu. The banana custard pancakes are AMAZING and the crepes are to die for -- not to mention the smoothies are perfect as a recovery drink after a long hike at Usary. Also, I greatly enjoyed the coupon option via Yelp. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Lovely place. The food was fresh. My husband and I both had benedicts and they were well done. I had the PCH benedict and it had just enough salmon and capers. The potatoes were very delicious and crispy. We also ordered the French toast and it was very soft and filled us up to the brim. The service was excellent. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"The food is really good BUT twice now I have sat at the counter and watched my food sit on the shelf for a minimum of 5 minutes while workers just stood there and stared at it. By the time it is brought to me the sauce is cold and the eggs are barely warm. I don't really understand why the workers are just standing there staring at plates of food that are completed and ready? Management really needs to look at their procedures because the food is good when it's hot!!"}
{"text":"Just ate some lunch at Sunnyside Breakfast Lounge, it was very good. I went with the intention of ordering breakfast, but couldn't resist the muffuletta sandwich. Not a real New Orleans style muffuletta sandwich, but it was still good.  I sorta feel like there are two sandwiches in the world that if you can't do them right, you should not do them at all. One of those sandwiches is the fried Monte Cristo and the other sandwich is the Muffuletta sandwich.   So, although it was good, it could be better. :) My daughter ordered the Sunnyside chicken panini. Both items were really good, nice sized portions and nice presentation.  We both had leftovers.  The staff was uber friendly and the chef came out to ask how our food was. Every staff member came by at one point to make sure we were well taken care of.  The next time we go I want to try a mixologist juice drink and those Nutella pancakes!  I made a comment when I checked in, saying that  I hated the brightly colored pleather booths, but after I sat there for awhile, they grew on me. But I still don't love them.  Our waitress was very sweet and it was apparent she wanted us to be very happy with our food and the service. I will go back soon. So happy to have a breakfast place close to home, \"Nestled in the Las Sendas Mountains\" ....as the menu states."}
{"text":"My dad and I really enjoyed our breakfast here today after a long bike ride down Usery. If you're looking for a nice patio and place to refuel , this is it! Friendly staff and great food ! PCH Benedict was the highlight if the meal. Definitely will be back again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I had the Chili verde omelette and my husband had the chicken fried steak-- both were delicious. Service was great and waitstaff super friendly."}
{"text":"Great place, great food and great service!! Food was delicious and would definitely recommend the Sonoran crepes. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Food is fresh and well prepared. Great omelets!  Love the Denver omelet!! Very good price. The service is outstanding. This is one of our breakfast favorites."}
{"text":"Waitress Jamie was nice and attentive. Sat at the bar because we came at a very busy time Saturday morning but I didn't mind. Got a juice and chorizo Benedict, both delicious but my bill was $21 for both those items so a bit pricy, that's the only reason for 4 stars."}
{"text":"This restaurant is FANTASTIC. New menu. Had the Sonora crepes which were unbelievable.  Had not been there in a year but will not wait that long before I'm  back.  This will be my go to breakfast place."}
{"text":"Great service, large portions, good prices, fresh produce and gluten intolerance savvy!  Has quickly become our go to place!! Cheryl (Gilbert)"}
{"text":"I had the waffle with strawberries which was one of the best waffles I've has. It was so light and fluffy and flavorful. The only reason I didn't give Sunnyside a 5/5 is because a lot of their meal options are non existent and mostly every thing is a la carte which makes for an expensive brunch/breakfast."}
{"text":"Sorry but this so OVER PRICED for what you get.  Adequate food, but nothing special.   Lousy coffee- if you charge me the cost of a Starbucks coffee, at the minimum make it as good as Pike Street blend.  Clean appearance, friendly staff, BUT WAY OVER PRICED."}
{"text":"Toast never arrived and no refills on coffee.  Never saw server after food placed on table.  Never return here. Can be ignored at home"}
{"text":"Our group of ten to twelve normally have no problem making a reservation! This venue does NOT reserve their separate room for a group! Several calls were made to no avail; we were delayed in being seated this morning until the front desk could gain approval from management for use of the room! All of us enjoyed our breakfast selections! Pleasant peach bellini was available! Our server was personable at first and then became increasingly snippy! Jamie's errors were of her own doing! Also, when politely asked (after all orders were delivered) to photograph our group she said \"not now, later\".... \"later\" never arrived! When in the service industry, customer service should be exemplary; otherwise, a patron's only recourse is to be reflective with the gratuity!"}
{"text":"I just wanna say, I can't wait to come back here and try more of the menu ... Everything looked amazing . I started with a peach tea Arnold Palmer and that was delicious and perfect for brunch. I usually don't have \"savory\" crepes but I decided to try the Sonoran crepe and it was the best thing I ate in that city. It is so flavorful and unique. The chorizo is perfect and their Hollandaise sauce really went with the rest of the dish. It definitely is a unique version of a crepe! I highly recommend. The benedicts looked delicious but I really wanted to venture out and try a savory crepe, definitely worth it!!"}
{"text":"Food was great.    Eggs Benedict was yum despite the hollandaise being a mix.  Bacon is amazing.  Service by Luis was excellent.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I rarely - if ever - leave reviews, but this was so disappointing I had to. First, our coffee was cold. Waitress remedied that fairly quickly and the coffee ended up being pretty decent. Since the first cup exhausted our sugar packets we asked for more. Those came about halfway through our meal, long after we'd already snagged some from another table. My wife ordered the regular Sunnyside breakfast with over hard eggs and wheat toast. She got over easy and rye. She mentioned it to the waitress, but decided to just deal with it as we didn't want to wait. None of it was hot, mostly barely warm. Our waitress seemed nice, but took way too long to get to us, get our bill (which was for full price despite getting her meal completely wrong) and return to us. On my end, my pancakes were fine. Not great, but not terrible. Overall food quality would have been good had it been served properly. We even noticed a guy nearby send his food back for a problem, too. There was also no obvious management person anywhere to be seen. When something wrong is brought to the attention of the staff, I always find it reassuring and commendable to be responded to by management for the mess up, even if it wasn't a big deal. Didn't happen here. We won't be back."}
{"text":"My first time here - about 11:00 on a Saturday morning. Got seated pretty quickly at an outside table (our group had requested to sit out on the dog-friendly patio). Service was prompt. The menu made it pretty hard to decide what to order - lots of variety. I chose the Garden omelette- made with egg whites - it was FULL of vegetables. I got fresh fruit rather than toast for the side. All of it was delicious and fresh. I got full. The four other people in my group loved their food, too (crepes, pancakes, omelette). The owner stopped by our table, which was nice. The atmosphere was great, good energy, nice decor.  I saw families with children here as well as solo diners. Prices were competitive with other eateries. AND the bathroom was clean! I wouldn't hesitate to send people here. I will be back."}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  We never got our food,  I was brought a dirty cup twice, kitchen staff arguing and then I see waitress blow her nose and not wash her hands and kept slinging food. NOPE."}
{"text":"Ate here for the 2nd time with my family. Service.....excellent.  Food.....excellent. Ambience.....very relaxing. We're pretty critical about our food since we were in the business ourselves. Live locally in Mountain Bridge, so we'll be back....frequently!"}
{"text":"So impressed with Sunnyside Breakfast Lounge. Tad, great service and thank you for the Chorizo Benedict suggestion. Also, fantastic Bloody Mary ... was better with the added spiciness on the 2nd go for me. Overall a gem of a place!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good about this place. Exceptional food, service, atmosphere, and reasonable prices. We always take our out-of-town visitors there for a real treat!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here with a old friend for breakfast after a meeting.  I had the biscuits and gravy and it was good.  The biscuits were homemade and you can taste it.  The sausage gravy was good too.  I could not tell if it was made from scratch either.  The portion was good too.  The thing that stood out was the server.  She did a fantastic job.  She seem to be right there on the spot at the right time too.  She was very friendly and happy.  Which makes for a nice dinning experience.  I like this place from what I can tell.  It is just a ways out of the way for me.  If I am in the area again I will hit this place up again."}
{"text":"It's the only place around to get freshly made green juices!  They even have specials on them on certain days of the week.  And our daughter loves their chocolate chip pancakes!"}
{"text":"Loved the fresh squeezed Orange juice.  Hated the hard biscuits and the chunky, greasy gravy.  The potatoes that come with your eggs are little squares of salt and grease. Reminds me of some that I can buy in the frozen food section at the supermarket, then fry in some lard and put lots of salt on them.  Too bad, since it is nice to have fresh squeezed OJ. The interior could use some cleaning.  High prices for what you get."}
{"text":"We can across this cute little spot in Mesa. The wait wasn't too long and the customer service was good.    I ordered the Banana Nutella Pancakes and the hubby ordered the chorizo omelette.  The food was alright. We felt like the chorizo omelette had an interesting taste, it wasn't our favorite. The banana Nutella Pancakes was tasty, but on the sweeter side. I felt like I had a few cavities after I ate it though.  My favorite is the Red Mountain Smoothie! It's very healthy, very refreshing on a hot summer day."}
{"text":"Pseudo fine-dining, great food, creative menu. Great service with friendly staff. Awesome Bloody Mary and pch eggs Benedict. We will be back!"}
{"text":"First time here. It is AMAZING! Ordered the country fried steak and banana pancakes. I'll be coming here often! The staff are very friendly too. Such a cute place"}
{"text":"I had an excellent experience eating at Sunnyside while my bike got fixed. The service was impeccable, from the host, to the chef who delivered the food, and my excellent server. The chorizo eggs Benedict, served on homemade focacia bread, was absolutely delicious. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for breakfast in Mesa."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's small but cozy and the food is fantastic. All the plates with chorizo are delicious. Sonoran crepes! Mimosa's are perfect."}
{"text":"Really good, fresh food at generous portions. Despite how busy they were today our server was attentive and efficient."}
{"text":"PCH benny was delicious. The salmon is outstanding.  My friend liked the green chimi.  The service was quick and great."}
{"text":"We had a delicious Sonoran Crepe and the Green Chili Omelette. Both were excellent with the Sonoran crepe being our favorite, the nopales were perfectly cooked. The bloody mary was one of the best I have had in a long time. The best part was the Executive Chef was running food to ensure it reached diners in a timely manner. Our waiter Tad was fantastic and a true service professional."}
{"text":"Awesome as usual. The eggs Benedict is my favorite here. Eggs are always poached perfectly. Best Bloody Mary in Mesa."}
{"text":"First time at Sunnyside.  I had the scrambled eggs, potatoes, English Muffin and fruit.  Perfectly made and yummy.  My Dad had biscuits and gravy.  He gave them a thumbs up.  Will be back to try more menu items."}
{"text":"I was worried about coming here on a Saturday morning, but we were seated quickly. The bagel breakfast sandwich was delicious especially because the bagels are freshly made! The freshly pressed juice isn't bad either. Very good vibes and people there"}
{"text":"Food was AMAZING, service was okay. The manager knew that the waitress was not at all helpful so he finished out our order. recommend trying but do not expect the fastest service. Great drinks!"}
{"text":"The chicken fried steak two of the guys had that were with me and they said too much bread and not enough meat. The hash browns were frozen unfortunately. I had the PCH Benedict, it had salmon it was not edible. I eat salmon every kind of way all the time and I could not eat it. The coffee was A+ and the waitress."}
{"text":"It's ok, cute decor. The food was ok and staff friendly. A new place on the block. Not sure if we'll be back for breakfast though."}
{"text":"I ordered the burrito that came with cream, guac and pico de gallo and my husband ordered the butcher's omelette... The omelette is very meaty and satisfying!!! Hubby was very happy!!!They serve large portions and thought next time we can split an entree... My burrito had sausage, breakfast potatoes and other veggies!! Very good and filling!! I would def com back to this place and recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast!  We tried the PCH Eggs Benedict and the breakfast chimi w/ chorizo.  The food was made from scratch with flavorful ingredients.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Today was my wife and I's first try and we  were nit disappointed. From the time we arrived, and left we were not disappointed. The wife had the Belgian Waffle with strawberries, and I had the Chile Verte omelet with wheat toast. The waffle was huge with a generous amount of strawberries and whipped cream. She reported the waffle was fantastic. My omelet was delicious and was stuffed with an array of goodies and topped with green chile sauce. In addition, our server was top notch and offered refills on drinks frequently. Would highly recommend to anyone living or visiting to  give it a try."}
{"text":"Breakfast and lunch location with indoor and outdoor seating.  Bright colors and clean.   Menu has a variety of fresh food and juices which are squeezed with the super duper juicer.  Have been a few times and will be back."}
{"text":"The best brunch ever! The juice was amazing, pancakes so good and the crab Benedict was the best I ever had."}
{"text":"This is the place to go!  Don't bother with any others. This is the best that we have found and to be honest there are some serious contenders but nothing better. The attention to detail at this place is obvious. From the spotless quality silverware to the real syrup, they take pride every aspect of their restaurant.  Great job guys!  You'll be seeing my face often."}
{"text":"Outstanding! I ordered the Salmon Benedict and it was amazing!! You need to try it, even if you aren't a huge Salmon lover. The Salmon is cured, so it has a great flavor. The focaccia bread and hollandaise are homemade. It was amazing.  My husband ordered the three egg breakfast with a side of biscuit & gravy, also homemade. Very, very good. Also, I noticed some dogs enjoying the patio. Very welcoming even for dogs."}
{"text":"Our food was tasty, fresh, and in adequate quantities.  Our server was personable, prompt and knew her menu items."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken fried steak breakfast with eggs over medium and home fries, also added a biscuit and gravy on the side. Sad to say I am disappointed,  the home fries look like the standard sysco frozen ones that you toss in the deep fryer, the eggs were brown and crispy on the eggs (personal pet peeve) and the gravy had the look of a broken bechamel sauce . The biscuit looked good except for the fact it had the same broken gravy on it. On to the taste,  the home fries not good,  overcooked and definitely from frozen. The egg despite violating my pet peeve was good,  I love the fact they use non pasteurized eggs.  The chicken fried steak was good definitely don't think it came frozen,  the gravy was good with what tasted like a hint of sage which I found acceptable but due to its broken nature it left a grainy feeling in my mouth. The biscuit,  sigh,  was very tough and borderline rubbery and the gravy with the hint of sage does not compliment it like it did with the chicken fried steak. The wait staff are all cheerful and pleasant which is always a bonus. I will definitely try eating here again because anyone can have an off day, especially in the kitchen, minus the home fries because you can't fix frozen."}
{"text":"I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a breakfast or lunch place in the area.  They are still a bit new, but they are working out the kinks.  I have a couple orders go wrong, but it is always quickly fixed.   Drinks:  Their iced tea choices are great and my friends have tried the smoothies which also get high remarks.  Food:  I really like their sandwiches and often get whatever is on the special board.  My friend loves their chicken sandwich.  I think they are on their way to creating the restaurant that they set out to.  I would like to see a 'build your own omelette' that would allow me to have my omelette my way.   Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service!  Their Benedicts are incredible. I always get the chorizo Benedict, my wife had the PCH Benedict today. She enjoyed it as well. Bloody Mary's are good, also."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, plenty of seating, quick service. Love their breakfast chimi's, hold the meat. Lots to chose from with healthy options."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and overall, it was good. The staff is extremely friendly, the drinks were delightful and my complicated order was made correctly.   I ordered the Classy Champagne and Plain Jane Benedict with spinach and avocado, tomatoes and hollandaise on the side. Their house made herb focaccia bread was delicious! The one thing I would change would be the poached eggs. I prefer poached eggs to be running and these were cooked medium to hard. Aside from that, breakfast was delightful.  My girlfriend ordered the Paloma and an omelette, really liking both.   I will be back. Good place with friendly service."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place and Luis is such a phenomenal server! Their crepes are spectacular, their omelettes are unique and yummy, and they do a great mimosa!"}
{"text":"Super delicious! Tried various dishes and all were excellent. Even the kids French toast was amazing! Can't wait to come back and try more. Great atmosphere and vibe. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times. The first time was great. The second was awful. Third time was horrid!  The server was great.  My food was terrible ! I ordered a Santa Fe chicken sandwich   I asked for a side of mayo.  I have no idea what she brought me but it was in no way, shape or form mayo. I took a few bites and soon realized there was an incredibly nasty taste in my mouth. I kept hoping it would get better  but by the last bite of half of the sandwich I was about ready to hurl. I have no idea if it was the chicken,the \"mayo\" or the spread they put on it. So I am done. Not trying it again."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places in the east valley my family heads there every Sunday after church I have not had anything there that was not delicious. Todd is one of the best servers I have ever had anywhere but the rest of them are also amazing."}
{"text":"We were invited to visit by the owner Gabrielle, he was a very friendly young man. I had the country fried steak and it was very good, great eggs and their potatoes were delicious, Gabrielle sent complimentary drinks to us and gave a free dessert pancake. When we ready to go he gave us a tour of the kitchen. He is so proud of his place and it is very refreshing to see a young person he has great work ethics and loves what he is doing. I look forward to eating their again and taking more of my family."}
{"text":"The most pleasant servers I have ever met! This makes for a very pleasant dining experience. Moreover they have a diverse menu selection.  Something for everyone. Quality of food very good. I will return on my next visit to Mesa..AZ"}
{"text":"Not a bad spot.  Stopped in before an all day softball tournament.  Waffle with bananas was good and so was the chorizo benedict.  Good place although it is on the more expensive end for breakfast."}
{"text":"First time we were there was pretty decent. We asked to sit on the patio and waited around 15min until a server came. His excuse was there was confusion on who was to serve us. Both servers that were outside saw us and made eye contact but neither came to check on us. But the food was good. We ended up getting a discount because we waited so long. Our second visit the waiter was kinda rude. He didn't check on us for quite awhile. As we were finishing up our food, a roach started crawling up from behind the booth and up the wall. We were sitting in the large circle booth in the corner. I had to get up and ask for our server to come to us since he was in the back. He was like okay I'll go tell them. Then after a little he comes back and says they don't want to do anything with you guys sitting here. He didn't offer a new table. So we were like okay we'll leave. He apologized and said oh it's probably because we sprayed for bugs yesterday... like that somehow made it all okay. He did give a small discount but we won't be returning because of the subpar service and a nonchalant roach crawling up above our table."}
{"text":"I came for the brunch, and I left with a new family. I was immediately greeted with arms wide open by the incredibly friendly staff; their warm embrace consumed my soul with an overwhelming sense of worth and purpose. I was destined to dine here. We ate, we laughed, we cried (tears of joy), we formed a precious bond cast with the fire of 1,000 suns. I want the chef to deliver my first born child and our waitress to be my child's au pair. The potatoes were a bit overcooked."}
{"text":"I love the food and ambiance here,  plus you can take your dogs and sit outside.   They even bring the fur babies a bowl of water."}
{"text":"Wife and I ate here this morning. Was a Sunday around 11 am so we expected a bit of a wait. After around 10 minutes we were seated. It was very loud from both customers and kitchen noise. We ordered and I went to wash my hands. The restroom was cleaner than a Walmart bathroom... But the paper towels were empty so I had to use the air dryer.       I ordered the chicken fried steak and my wife ordered the Sonoran crepes. Mine came with eggs and house fries. When they brought it out it only came with a tiny cup of catsup, so speak quickly if you need more. Miraculously it was enough for me. The Sonoran crepes my wife ordered were fantastic (I tried a bite). Not too spicy, I personally would have got it hotter.  All in all it was a great meal. Our waiter was pleasant and kept our coffees full. There are many other items on the menu we both want to try so we'll be back for sure. The juice drinks look great but are a little pricey (more than $10 for basic drinks).      We do recommend trying this place as it was great for our first time there and we will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This is an amazing breakfast for a very reasonable price.   All the juices, smoothies and cocktails are freshly made by Eric and T is a great asset to their service!   The staff is friendly and happy.   I have yet to see anyone fuss about their meal,  breakfast or lunch.  We are note established regulars and happy to have such a nice place to go to."}
{"text":"So yummy! Had the PCH Benedict. Perfectly cooked poached eggs. Focaccia was soft and flavorful - Rosemary was great compliment to hollandaise. Prompt friendly service. A good experience."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service and a relaxed atmosphere. We will be back. The Crab Cake Benedict is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Kudos to Chef Gabriel for fusing native food with modern cuisine that appeals to both crowds. He is doing what local chefs should all be doing, including foods like nopales (prickly pear) in his recipes, showcasing our local foods like Seattle does with salmon and New Orleans does with gumbo. Try a nopal smoothie from the juice bar or a Chicano panini--you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Cute trendy brunch spot in east mesa. I was pleasantly surprised when my family took me to this place. They were pretty busy so our wait was going to be about 30 min, surprisingly we only waited 20 min before being seated.   We were seated and about 5 min later we were greeted by our server. She was friendly and helpful with suggestions from the menu.   I had the salmon egg Benedict which was quite delicious. The capers were a good touch. I would go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast, good service and nice ambiance. I had the breakfast chimi and my wife had the crab cale Benedict - we both finished our plates. The maniac juice is a must! I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"This was our first time here but won't be our last! Service was fast and friendly! We had French toast and it was the best I've ever had! !! I had the breakfast chimichanga which was very delicious! I'm sure we had of the best service in the East Valley thanks to our waiter Tad! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"my best friend from Peoria, IL came into town and this was the first place I took him too. The food is #Oooooh and too amazing, fye, great, fantastic. I love going to a place where I can get some big portions and great customer service. The Owner Gabe and his staff do a tremendous job not only making you feel welcomed but making sure you leave with a satisfied belly and smile on your face. My mom, brother, and sisters are coming in April and I will definitely take them to Sunnyside once they get off the plane.  If you are looking for a great place to have breakfast, a brunch date, a Sunday meal after Church head up to Sunnyside in Mesa!!! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Was disappointed the first time we went - the portion to price ration was HORRIBLE. You got very little food for high price. Then we decided to give it a try about 7 months later and it seemed that the menu had changed and the food was MUCH better. And you received much more for the price you paid. The service was great. And we will probably be back."}
{"text":"Had the garden veggie omelette- it was great! We had a large table of people and our server was very kind and patient with us. Would definitely come back for breakfast."}
{"text":"So delicious!! Good service and great food, with a welcoming atmosphere and scenic view. Would definitely come back and recommend this place again :)"}
{"text":"I have gone to Sunnyside since it opened, off and on, service use to be hit or miss and the menu ok but they have really stepped up their game..today it was excellent!  The menu has greatly improved and specials!  We were promptly seated upon arrival and served with a smile.  The drinks were outstanding, spicy bloody mary, and the food was great!  The patio is dog friendly which is another perk!  I would highly recommend and keep up the good work Sunnyside! :)"}
{"text":"Sunny side is a great breakfast or brunch place with many drink and eating options. Here, you can have coffee and OJ or cappuccino and mimosa - whatever floats your boat. I was very happy with their side of fruit as it wasn't only the typical filler fruits of honeydew and cantaloupe. They also gave a good amount of strawberries and blueberries. The highlight for me was the eggs Benedict. The eggs were done very well, the hollandaise was great and their unique focaccia bread added a lot of flavor to the dish. The pancakes were also great. Everyone enjoyed their food and service was good!"}
{"text":"2.5 STARS. This place was just ok, but not ok enough to bring me back. Our waitress, Christina, provided excellent service, but the food wasn't all that. At the risk of sounding overly harsh, the Chorizo Eggs Benedict was a culinary nightmare. The chorizo was a greasy, nearly flavorless congealed mass (other than an abundance of salt) atop rosemary embedded foccacia. Although the eggs were poached almost perfectly, the mismatched combination of flavors was an assault to the palate. Texturally, it may as well have been a bowl of porridge. My wife had a basic breakfast that consisted of eggs, toast, bacon, and a biscuit with gravy. Pretty basic, and really not any better than you'd expect from a roadside diner or complimentary hotel breakfast. A side order of pancakes for the kiddo was rather flavorless and lacked any visual appeal. They were thin, not fluffy, and almost entirely white."}
{"text":"The food here is underwhelming I've only been for breakfast so lunch might be another story.  There seems to be a shortage of good breakfast places in the area and the service is good, the atmosphere is nice.  we would continue to visit this place if it were more convenient. It's definitely not worth a special trip."}
{"text":"The mimosas are excellent and taste so fresh! As well as their juiced drinks!   The food has big portions, and tastes delicious!   Service was great, our waitress was so attentive and spent a lot of time talking with customers and making them feel valued!   Anytime someone brings up Sunnyside, I'm ready to hop in a car and go!"}
{"text":"Sunnyside Breakfast Lounge has clearly gotten past the opening jitters and have stepped up their game.    I stopped in for lunch today and was quickly greeted by Elena. She offered booth or table, then asked about drinks. Good start!  After my iced tea arrived, I ordered the Red Mountain Burger, which came with some nicely seasoned fries. The burger was a bit over cooked but still very juicy, served on a pretzel bun. I scarfed it all down.  Elena checked in on me just the right amount to assure all was well, without being pushy. Executive Chef Garfio also checked with the tables, which was a great touch.   If Yelp allowed individual ratings like Trip Advisor does, I would give them: 5 overall; 4 for food (-1 for over cooked); 5 for service and 5 for quality and 5 for value.   Good job Sunnyside!"}
{"text":"This place sucks. Waited ten minutes then we were seated.  We sat at a booth that had condensation dripping in three spots on to the table and myself. We had to requst a table change so the water won't get in my food.  The service and good was so slowwwww !!!!! It took us about one hour plus to get in and out.   I had high hopes that this place will be good. But I am disappointed."}
{"text":"Second day in a row. We are here on vacation from California and this spot was a great find."}
{"text":"Loved the food and I wished I heard of this place before. Great people work here and treat you like family. I will definitely have to return to this place."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place!!! Big selection of juices and alcoholic beverages. I got the chicken fried steak it was cooked perfectly and had a large amount of options for sides. Coffee was hot and the staff was really friendly. $-$$ I will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this new breakfast spot. When we entered there were many empty tables but a strange host told us that we would need to wait 20 to 30 minutes. Then several servers kept telling him that they had open tables and we were finally seated by a server.   The menu was limited. I like omelets but none of the combos appealed to me and there was no make your own option. I choose pancakes with a side of bacon. My husband picked an egg combo.  The pancakes were really dense, just horrible. The bacon was delicious. My husband did not like his food either. Potatoes were bland.   Disappointing, I would skip this place."}
{"text":"Lovin' it! Quick and easy to get in and sit down. Great food. Amazing fluffy pancakes and an awesome smoothie!! Happy to always return!!"}
{"text":"Well we decided to give this place another shot. It has been 6 months and we are back. So far it hasn't been great; we have been here for over 30 mins & have not received our food. It's not that busy and it's sooooo slow. I'll get back to this review once our food arrives.   Ok so we got our food & I'm not impressed. My hollandaise was cold. I asked for warm sauce, it was still COLD. Yeah that did not make me happy. My hubby's Philly Benedict had hardly any meat (check photo) & my plain Jane Benedict was just OK.    We gave this place 2 chances and it failed both times. I'd rather go to village inn then eat at this place."}
{"text":"Great spot, super popular. I'm a breakfast snob, so a 5 star might be appropriate for most. I however have a bar set so high it's rare for a place to hit it.   Negative feedback is minimal; It's either rosemary or sage, but there is just to darn much of it in their biscuits and gravy.   Highlights; Home fries are amazing!   Get ready for a wait on most days, but I would say it's worth it! I also saw some bloody Mary's leaving the bar and they looked legit, so party hard and plan on a recovery breakfast to beat most!"}
{"text":"One of the BEST places for breakfast you'll find!! Great food and service is excellent as well. Lots of fresh juices and menu has something for everyone! Glad to have this little gem in NE Mesa!"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this restaurant for awhile now.  We had to drop my bike off down the road apiece and had time to kill so we went in for some breakfast!  We were seated right away in a comfy booth.  Our waiter Tad ( who was fabulous by the way) was attentive, informative and an all around nice guy!  My husband loves corned beef hash so Tad made a suggestion and we went with that!  This is the real deal, not like the Hormel from the can.  Fresh diced corned beef with potatoes mixed in.  Quite delish and you could almost make a meal out of this side alone.  My husband had the Sunnyside trio with the corned beef as a side and he was quite happy with his choice.  The potatoes are real and not at all greasy.  I wish I could make mine like that!  I on the other hand am braver and like to take risks.  So I had the Sonoran crepes and it was an excellent choice.  Light as a feather crepes with scrambled eggs, peppers, nopalitos and nice and cheesy.  Just the right amount too!  Topped with some spicy pico di'gallo!  It had just enough kick to tease the pallet and not overwhelming.   Coffee was good and hot and refills were quick.  I have nothing bad to say about Sunnyside.  In fact, as I was looking at YELP for reviews we got 20% off our bill for checking into the place.  Would I go here again you ask?  Yes I would!  I want to try everything on the menu.  The picture I'm attaching is of the Sonoran crepes.  Sorry for the bite marks, but it looked so good I forgot to take a good picture before I dug in!"}
{"text":"We drove a little ways from Tempe to check out this breakfast place because we had a coupon and saw all the great reviews.   I am glad we came because it was well worth the drive! We were sat immediately and greeted promptly by our server. The kitchen got our food out very quickly and everything was delicious! I had the butcher's omelet and she had the plane Jane with avocado. Our server was friendly and quick to get us anything we asked for.   Overall really good (and filling) food and good service    I would definitely recommend this place to friends and will be back in the future."}
{"text":"Very good. Had the eggs Benedict and the eggs were perfect - it appears they sous vide them. The hollandaise was a bit thinner than my preference. Hubby totally enjoyed the corn beef hash. Good stuff. Ambiance is a bit noisy."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. The food has always been good. Over my visits, I've ordered the Breakfast Chimi, some sort of traditional breakfast combo, and waffles. The waffles are perfect.   Even on Father's Day the wait wasn't too long to get seated, however,  general, the wait for food is a little too long. I didn't time the wait, but my perception was that it felt too long.  After reading other reviews and from a process improvement standpoint, I would say the issues they are experiencing may be from a malfunctioning kitchen staff. The mishaps were all food related, including preparation. It doesn't seem like the kitchen flows smoothly.  My observation is that they've hired more experienced and older wait staff, so it is a pleasant experience. They know how to take care of the patron. Drinks were refilled, coffee was topped off and they were appropriately friendly.   I think there is an imbalance with the amount of tables available to seat customers to the amount of food the kitchen can produce in a timely manner. Take out a few tables and customers will have to wait a few minutes more, but it is always better to have a steadily busy restaurant, then hungry and unhappy customers.  Overall, for a casual breakfast/lunch experience this is a good place to go. I've gone a few times and will continue to go as long as the food quality remains the same."}
{"text":"Wasnt expecting much.I was WRONG! Genius idea with the herbed foccacia as base for the eggs benedict. Everything was so fresh and so delish. Service was super lovely too, to the nice man in the lime shirt who was out waiter haiiiiiiii!"}
{"text":"I would love to give this place 5 stars just based on their bloody marys! However, they really deserve the 3 stars based on service and quality of food. My friend and I went there after a treacherous hike by Saguaro Lake and we tired, thirsty, and hungry.  There was no wait and we sat right down and ordered bloody marys as they claim to have the best ones around. COOL!  Water was delivered and then we waited. We waited for over 15 min before another waiter cam over and asked us if we wanted to order drinks. Drinks? Yes, we said we ordered bloody marys over 15 min ago. Oh!  He said he'd check. Another 10 min goes by and he comes to take our order. Still no drinks. We wait another 10 minutes and finally the drinks come. About 5 minutes later our food arrived. My order was wrong and my friend's breakfast burrito was right but he took them both away anyway. He came back 10 min later with our correct order and the food he brought around the same burrito which by now was getting cold. All in all it was a decent tasting meal and the bloodies were delicious but the service was so bad that it's almost not worth it."}
{"text":"Brunch for Everyone:  Great place to enjoy Father's Day brunch.  I am an out-of-town visitor, from health-conscious Seattle.  I was concerned Sunnyside would be a gluten-filled grease bomb.  To the contrary, many clean food options.    Our waitress, Tiara, did a great job.  Prompt and knowledgable, and put up with my very specific (picky lol) requests.  Most importantly, the food was great.  You guys nailed the upper-middle class brunch market."}
{"text":"Had breakfast there this morning.  Very disappointed. The staff was friendly enough but very scattered,  I know that they have been only open a few weeks, but they should have most of the kinks worked out by now.  My wife ordered the french toast, it was nothing special and it was totally covered with cinnamon shaken right out of the container - way to much.  I had the butchers omelet.  I was thinking that it would have a decent amount of meat in it according to the menu.  It had a couple small pieces of chorizo and very little cheese.  It was luke warm, the toast was cold and the potatoes tasteless. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"We had a lovely breakfast here a few mornings ago! And the service was awesome. I had the chicken fried steak with curly fries. Very flavorful and the sausage gravy on top was delicious! My husband had the breakfast bagel, he's picky about things so he loved that the bagel was soft and easy to eat! He enjoyed it and ate every bite.(had it with bacon). My sons food off of the kids menu looked really great too! He had the pancake stack. They also had Ratatouille playing on the tv next to our table so my son was entertained most of the time! Our meal wasn't that expensive even though a lot of people say it is, I'm not sure why! We even ordered coffee and OJ. It was a decent price. We will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"excellent bene's today i had the salmon bene i have also had the chorizo  the hollindaise is light and lemony service is top notch"}
{"text":"Corned beef hash is my personal test of a breakfast place. If they serve me that canned dog food stuff or if the poached eggs are hard, I don't go back.    The Sunnyside Breakfast Lounge served me actual minced corned beef topped with two perfectly poached eggs draped with delicious hollandaise sauce. The home fries were diced and deep fried but not a bit greasy. How did they do that? My enthusiasm was such that I had to make myself slow down. ( I'm a lady, right?)   My husband had the....get this....Peach Cobbler Pancakes. Omg. The panckes were fluffy, with a topping of peaches, dusted with powdered sugar and sprinkled with pie crust crumbles. The side of ham was more like a slab of ham. It was a beautiful sight. He enjoyed every mouthful.    They offer so many delightful omelets, pancakes and crepes, I'm looking forward to my next visit. Maybe I'll have the banana custard pancakes with nutella spread and sliced bananas. Or maybe I will have the salmon benedict; eggs benedict with smoked salmon and light caper sauce. MMM mm mm.   The staff is efficient, friendly and attentive.    This is my very favorite place for breakfast. Oh. They serve lunch also but close at 2:00pm. so don't miss out."}
{"text":"Good food, but the service is fair. My creamer for the coffee came very late. The kids meals pancakes and toast never showed. We asked for a spicy Bloody Mary received a regular."}
{"text":"We sat right down but it took close to 20 minutes for our food to come out. It was Saturday afternoon but it was almost empty. The food was hard to eat, it tasted like prepackaged everything that was made in the morning and then microwaved before it was delivered to us. The 4 people in my group were all of the same opinion, unfortunately. The two stars were for the mostly clean environment."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I used to love going to Sunnyside on Sunday mornings. Our favorite was the chicken fried steak and the Benedict eggs with hollandaise and corned beef hash. Our last visit was not as impressive as all the others. I noticed there were new workers and our server was not very attentive, but it happens. It's always a bit busy on Sundays. What was more heartbreaking was the quality of the food! I'm not sure what happened but nothing tasted how it used to. Now that we've moved, we're not sure making the drive back to give it a second chance. Hopefully they get things right and make it as memorable as I first remembered Sunnyside to be."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere is nice. Service is great and food comes out fresh and in just the right amount of time. Prices are pretty reasonable although juices are a bit too expensive. The $1 pancakes are absolutely delicious! 2 medium size pancakes are served, but you have to order a drink to be able to get this deal. Since the juices are expensive, my husband ordered a cup of coffee which is reasonably priced. Definitely recommended, definitely coming back and bringing family here next time! I'm feeling super good after this great breakfast here, yum"}
{"text":"Disappointed.   For  $ 50,-   we  could  have  had  breakfast  at  the  Marriott  or  Hilton.  Interesting  that  only  9  reviews  show  up  under  \"recommended\"  (of  course 4 or 5  star  reviews)   and  the  other  85  reviews  with  1  or  2  stars  are  hidden  under  \"not  recommended....     Quality  of  the  food  was  poor,   we  were  not  even  asked  how  we  wanted  our  eggs  which  came  without  even  a  slice  of  tomato  or  any  kind  of  vegetable.    $ 6,-  juice  came  definitely  from  a can  or  a  box,  we  both  tasted  the   corn  syrup.   We  definitely  will  go  somewhere  else  next  time."}
{"text":"For an area that is lacking in dining out options, especially for breakfast, I am happy to have sunnyside cafe. They are fast and friendly and I love the chorizo Benedict! I Hope they stick around so I encourage everyone to support our local Mesa businesses!"}
{"text":"Great food and cocktails!! We enjoyed lox and bagels and an omelette on the patio after a beautiful hike of the wind Caves. We had great service and a tasty bloody mary!"}
{"text":"Great for groups and the staff is very friendly. Our waitress didn't have reservations about telling us that she needed to take our questions to someone else. I have left establishments due to their rudeness about food allergies. I felt at ease when she was pleasant and eager to get me answers."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service. I came here on a Sunday morning wanting to get ONE smoothie. I asked the man up front how long it would take and they said less than 5 minutes.. 15 minutes later they give me my $6.00 smoothie HALF FULL. HALF FULL. These people were so busy that they had the nerve to give me my smoothie HALF FILLED UP. I paid $6.00 for that smoothie and not only did I have to wait 15 minutes for them to make my smoothie when the original wait time was under 5, they gave me a half full smoothie and then acted like it was completely OK. I ended up having to wait ANOTHER 10 minutes for my smoothie.. 25 minutes for a freaking smoothie, I could have literally gone across the street to Bashas and gotten some naked juice and called it a day. Instead I had high hopes for Sunnyside Breakfast Lounge and wanted to support a local business. I won't be coming back here, even though we literally live right across the street."}
{"text":"Fantastic food & friendly service. It's a great place to stop for a post ride meal. Good variety of menu choices for anyone in your party."}
{"text":"I have eaten there a couple times and just have never been impressed. The food is ok, but not amazing."}
{"text":"First time there and I won't be back. Ordered biscuits and gravy, a special for the day.  When I got it, it was lukewarm at best. Sent it back, was returned to me no hotter than the first time. Waitress said she could warm it again but I decided why bother. No manager came by to see if he could make things right, no offer to make me something else.  Not a restaurant that cares if their customers return."}
{"text":"Everything, especially the eggs, are so fresh! The service is excellent and fast! My favorite! I am never disappointed. We will definitely be back!! We took a large group of friends from out of town and they got the order perfect. The bloody Mary's are the best in town! We enjoy the atmosphere and specialty of the day. The juices are very healthy and yummy!"}
{"text":"Had the PCH Benedict which was extremely flavorful. The eggs were poached perfectly and the combination of smoked salmon with capers was a perfect accompaniment. My criticism of the dish is the home fries. I believe that the dish would be far more flavorful if the diced chunk potatoes weren't fried, but rather sautéed or grilled. They were too dry as prepared. Service was attentive and flavorful. Will definitely go back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Sunny side is our favorite brunch spot!! The food is absolutely amazing! The staff is always cheerful and provides recommendations. We drive over 25 miles to come here! Highly recommended! And the eggs Benedict all of them a must!!"}
{"text":"Great chorizo eggs Benedict, friendly staff, family style environment. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came here for a friend's birthday brunch with 24 people, and the staff was so accommodating and did a great job of bringing everyone's food out at the same time. I got the corned beef hash and it was sooo good! It was the perfect amount of salt and the beef was perfectly cooked. The eggs were also perfect! This dish didn't disappoint, and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Mixed bag.  The place is nicely decorated.  The staff friendly and attentive. I had pancakes. Very good. My wife had french toast. Disappointing.  This is one of those places you want to succeed.  They have some work to do."}
{"text":"Overpriced for what you get. Seriously, if you demand higher quality ingredients/food and service this place is not for you. I don't mind paying more for awesome service and food, but this place severely missed the mark. Server acted irritated to be serving us. I was deceived by pictures and thought the food would be fresh. The \"home fries\" are like frozen potato squares that they deep fry and then put no seasoning on.   All the 5 star reviews leads me to believe we came on an \"off day\", but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"We make fairly frequent trips from Gold Canyon ... 23 mi. Interesting recipes - delicious too. Patio seating in good weather. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I have always loved this place.  However, my most recent visit was uncomfortable and embarrassing.  Apparently the \"Cook\" thinks he's a surgeon the way he was yelling and demanding things.  He was making it uncomfortable to sit and listen to this aggressive loud tone.  Owner or manager should remind him he's the \"Cook\","}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  The Sonoran Crepes are wonderful.  A bit spicy, but not too much. The best biscuits and gravy we've had in a restaurant, albeit a bit pricey. They were almost as good as we make at home and a lot less work. The home fries are nothing special. Pretty much the same as most places. Their specialty juices are very good, but be careful, they add up fast on the bill. We'll definitely be back  when we are in the area, and we plan to be in the area for about 2 more months."}
{"text":"Then the Sunnyside breakfast launch a bunch of times great service great food I love this fresh squeeze lemonade"}
{"text":"I love the sausage gravy they have so I decided to stop in for a dish I was making at home. The price was $3.08  which was fine until I was brought a cup that you would put ranch in. I mentioned how small the amount was for the price, the hostess proceeded to see if he could get me another cup which was commendable. When the hostess apparently attempted to get more, I heard the cook yell to the point I could hear it at the front counter \"I ALREADY GAVE YOU A SIDE OF GRAVY\". I'm not sure if this size was the only option since I wasn't given another choice. The action of the cook is enough for me to never set foot in here again. More options for sides like gravy would be nice , no need to yell at the hostess who was just trying to help. Just because you don't deal directly with the customers doesn't mean your actions won't affect the establishment as a whole."}
{"text":"got there on Saturday morning around 9 30 and was seated right away...this was not the case when we left the place, I think like 20-30min wait food was delicious and quantity was plenty service was friendly restrooms were clean has a full bar!! the Verde sauce and chorizo are scrumptuous!!!"}
{"text":"Took my mom here for Mothers Day and was very impressed. The service was great, everyone was quick and attentive without being pushy. The food came out with perfect timing and was delicious, portioned properly and at the correct temperature.  Even on a super busy day like Mother's Day this place ran like a well oiled ship, hats off to all the management and staff. What I appreciated the most was they let my mom and I have a nice relaxed breakfast and didn't try to rush us out. We were there a little over an hour but once the brunch crowd showed up we left. Also, they did not give me any problems when i used a Yelp deal. I will definately be coming back"}
{"text":"I don't often give a 5 star but this one deserves it.  Had a rejuvenate ro start out my toast Buda to a fresh squeezed pineapple juice with my breakfast.  Thw biscuits and gravy are awesome and then to finish off my meal we shared the Savory Slobodan Crepes again WOW.   What a wonderful breakage, we will be back over and over to try other stuff. Service is GREAT,  thank you Angie!"}
{"text":"This should have been a 4 star experience, but some poor logic and customer service brought it to three. I've eaten here a handful of other times and they were all 4 or 5 star experiences.  This time I had the All American. It comes with one egg, one biscuit with gravy, one sausage, one bacon, home fries and toast.  Since it included a biscuit toast seemed redundant, so I looked on the a la carte menu and saw they charged the same for a side of toast as they do for one egg, seeing this when the rushed waiter came I ordered and asked if I could sub the toast for an extra egg since they were the same price. He said he'd have to check and came back and told me no. I said even though they are the same price on the menu? He said no substitutions unless I pay. So I paid for the extra egg and still got no toast. This is poor customer service. We also had to wait for silverware. They were busy, but that is no excuse. I will continue to go back and hope the experience and customer service is better next time."}
{"text":"We were in the area and saw a few breakfast spots via yelp. We decided on this amazing location. Sunnyside absolutely impressed us. The staff was really friendly and the music was on point. And not to loud.  We had the country fried steak meal and the French toast meal. With a large glass of freshly squeezed orange juice and a cup of coffee.  The place was really busy but we were seated within a few mins. The waiter was very attentive and offered great suggestions. The food was delivered to our table quickly and tasted absolutely fantastic. I ate every last bite and I even had a few bites of the French toast.   This location deserves a 5 star review. If we are ever on that side of town again we will definitely come to this spot. All and all I absolutely recommend trying this spot. You won't regret the decision."}
{"text":"I came here for a Bloody Mary breakfast with my brother.  I really enjoyed mine but needed to be more spicy. I also order the corned beef hash. The corned beef was pretty good, but not the best I've had. My favorite part of that meal was the poached egg with hollandaise sauce on it! When it comes to hollandaise sauce, it's the icing on the cake in my opinion! The breakfast potatoes were just ok...seasoned well but pretty dry.  All in all, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Just opened two weeks ago and already has bugs worked out....See bad review below.  Great organic food menu n regular food too.  No lines now because its new.  Enjoy while you can.  I guarantee hour waits soon."}
{"text":"This is a classic breakfast place. Great service, honest portions, and good well prepared food. It can be busy, we waited a half an hour for a table last Sunday. Was well worth the wait. Since then, we've been back once and are already plotting another return."}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast place in north Mesa.  Came here before road trip to Apache Trail Scenic byway. Service was very friendly.  I saw today's special crab cake benedict as I walked in and decided to order. Like other benedict here, they serve on home made focaccia bread. I like focaccia bread but I learned I like simple English muffin when paired with hollandaise sauce. The sauce and focaccia bread were fighting for its own distinctive flavor, it wasn't for me. focaccia bread sat heavy for a while. Really filled me up, I was full for a while.  Crab cake served is decent size. Deep fried crab cake. I really liked the concept but imitation crab wasn't necessary. I would prefer to pay extra for real crab.  They have Bloody Mary and mimosa on the menu. Lovely ambiance, good place to come for leisurely branch."}
{"text":"Good place. Staff were friendly, albeit a little quirky. Our server seemed pretty proud of his work, which was cool.   Portions were good. Food was really tasty, although I would like to see a gluten free menu here. They fresh-squeeze their juice, which tastes awesome, but it is pretty pricey at $4.50 for 16 oz. They have nice thick bacon, cooked perfectly. I would've gotten a smoothie but the menu said they are ice-blended and that just waters things down unnecessarily when they could just freeze the fruit. I suppose I could've asked but I didn't. Fruit smoothies should never have ice, in my opinion.    Overall, prices are good. We used their yelp deal to save a few bucks too. Speed of service was perfect. Place was clean and had clean menus. That's a plus because who wants to go to a breakfast place and touch sticky syrupy menus? If they get a certified gluten free menu I'll change it to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Sunnyside is one of my favourite places for brunch! They have plenty of seating both inside and out on the patio. I like their crepes here, especially the berry crepe. It was so decadent; the mascarpone was very light and complimented the taste of the berries very well. Although I have been here a few times now, I may have only ordered crepes every time! I guess it became a habit, but now I have a crepe place close by!"}
{"text":"I took my family to this restaurant after a family shooting session at Salt River reservation based on good review and nearby. I have to add I agree with all reviews I saw in Yelp. The food is pretty good. I ordered crepes and it was good - not a wow experience, but it was good. I asked my family for their review and all of them said 4 for food and speedy service. Our waiter, Luis, did a good job ensuring we all are satisfied with the food."}
{"text":"It was amazing food. I got the sunnyside breakfast and it was great. The server was nice. We got seated right away. They have a great menu that's simple and to the point. I can't wait to try more things there."}
{"text":"I have been three times now and it keeps getting worse. Sunday morning it was busy and they just do not have enough help. We got our coffee and juice and I asked for a spoon to stir my sugar and cream into my coffee and by the time the spoon came coffee was cold. I ordered Plain Jane Eggs Benedict which advertised lots of hollandaise. The \"lots of hollandaise\" turned out to be about two tablespoons full and so I asked for more sauce........again a long wait so I ate one of the eggs and then when the sauce came I poured it over my other egg and the potatoes. When I took a bite I found the sauce was refrigerator cold!  Prices are on the high side and it just is not worth it.  Coffee had grounds in it.  The fresh squeezed orange juice is fabulous, however!"}
{"text":"My mom and I came here based off of the reviews and it was just as good as everyone hyped it up to be! My mom had the bagel sandwich and I had the savory Sonoran crepes (also to mention my first time having crepes) they were AMAZING ! Also had a Bloody Mary, which was great as well. The only complaint I could have was the wait was a little long for having a couple tables open and ready to be sat. Defiantly will be thinking of this place when wanting to get breakfast again!"}
{"text":"We went for breakfast on Tuesday, Feb. 21. This was the second visit for my husband and me. We were excited to take out of state visitors to experience this restaurant. While the food was good, our server Tad was very rude and unfriendly. He basically barked questions at us concerning our order. He rushed responses to his questions and made us feel like we were too much trouble for him to wait on. There was no greeting or introduction as most servers practice. A while later he went to another table and began conversing and laughing with them. I guess since we are not regular customers there was no need for him to be friendly or helpful. Please note that it was NOT a busy time in the restaurant. I don't think we will be bringing visitors back. We will go where the server at least acts like they appreciate our business."}
{"text":"Sooooo good!!  And for a great price too!  Got the fully loaded omelette with all meat, home fries, two pancakes with chocolate chips and peanut butter all for just $14.   Even if you're not that close to here, definitely come by an check it out for sure!  Thanks Nicole for getting our food and being so nice!  Will definitely come back again next time I'm in Arizona,"}
{"text":"First time to this place and we had high hopes. The waitress recommended the Crab Cake Benedict and hyped It up by saying it's been a special for so long bc it's so good! Being from the east coast I love my crab cakes so I was in. Food came and one look and I saw the fake crab it and was so bummed. It was the imitation crab meat you see at the grocery store. Awful. On the upside, my daughter really seemed to enjoy her pancakes and my mimosa was pretty yummy."}
{"text":"1st time coming here and I loved it! Service was very friendly and attentive to your needs. I tried the breakfast chimi and it was everything I hoped for!! I definitely will continue to come here and recommend this place for anyone looking for a relaxing breakfast/brunch place to eat."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast lounge with great service and great good!   I started my brunch with a mimosa, made with fresh squeezed orange juice. A traditional drink made perfectly the orange juice to champagne ratio was up to par. For my meal I order the garden omelette. The omelette was the perfect size for me, very filling! I loved all the vegetables to name a few it had kale, mushrooms, asparagus and spinach. My favorite part of my brunch was drink I ordered with my meal, the Moscow mule recommended by the chef himself! I was more than pleased with Chef Gabriel's recommendation it was so crisp, refreshing with a hint of lime. The Moscow mule is my new favorite drink!    If your in Mesa, AZ I recommend you check it out!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat!   The food is always amazing and the service is fast. I don't know if they just hire great servers or train them well but I've been here ten to fifteen times I the past year and service is perfect.  The food is fresh and exciting. Sweet or savory, the food never disappoints. I love their country fried steak... their biscuits are drool worthy.   You can't go wrong with the fresh squeezed orange juice (it's right behind the counter)"}
{"text":"The food was very good, they have a lot of choices. Good servers. The gluten free pancakes were delicious!  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Sunnyside has amazing all natural and organic juices! Great place to go for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Nice place in NE Mesa to grab breakfast. We were seated right away and greeted immediately by our server. I felt the menu had a lot of options. I picked the corn-beef hash and eggs and my friend picked the biscuits and gray. Both dished were delicious and we were pleasantly surprised by the large portion sizes. We also each ordered a coffee drink. I order a machiatto and was a little disappoint that it didn't fill the coffee cup- it was almost an inch from the rim of the mug. The only other opportunity was the server did take a little while to come back take our order. However, the food came out very quickly and she was very attentive to our needs, refilling our drinks and ensuring we had everything we needed. Would definitely go again and would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Found this gem when we were in between soccer games at Red Mountain.  My kids and I found it to be great, and we are super picky about breakfast. You can tell the staff from the Mitch to the front take pride in what they do. It seemed most everything was made from scratch, which is awesome!! If you live in Mesa check them out!!"}
{"text":"A recent discovery in Mesa and new favorite.  I had the green chili omelette and we shared the fruit bowl (fresh fruit, cottage cheese, granola and agave).  Both were excellent and the service was top notch!"}
{"text":"Great service, cheerful atmosphere. Food was served very quickly and tasted great.   G"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service! We love taking our dog and sitting on the patio.  We have never gotten anything we didn't love. The Benedicts are amazing.  There can be a wait, so try to beat the rush or go a bit after the normal breakfast rush if possible."}
{"text":"I so wanted to give this a higher rating but I just couldn't.  On the positive side, service was good and staff was friendly.  They also gave us a free breakfast voucher since we weren't crazy about the food.  On the down side, the sausage was really bad, the potatoes weren't cooked long enough and overall the food just wasn't that great..  I think they need to start over with a new chef and then this place could have potential.."}
{"text":"The service is awesome the are all kind and quick on their feet. I had the country fried steak with eggs and home fries. The food was awesome! My mom had the rocky point omelette and it was also delicious. Highly recommend this place they are open daily 7am- 2pm"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Surprisingly healthy and tasty omelette. Try to get a seat outside since you may get a view of mountain."}
{"text":"A great place to come for breakfast. Everything is fresh and delicious and their bloody Mary's are on point! Service is top notch too! I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Sat at a table for 12 minutes without a greeting.  Got up to leave and waitress acted like I was in the wrong.   Shame on her!  Went across the street to What's Crackin and had an awesome breakfast with great service.  The middle aged angry brunette at sunnyside needs to retire!"}
{"text":"Here's the deal. This is our go to breakfast joint and has been for the better part of the last year and a half. It's super tasty and right across the street from home. They're always super slammed on the weekends- makes sense it's like the only good spot in the area but they mess up our orders too often not to mention it. Because they're so busy we never eat in we always order to go. We've shown up and they've sent our orders off with door dash, we've ordered one thing and been given another thing instead, we've shown up MULTIPLE times to find out only one of our orders was put in and have to wait while one dish gets cold so they can make the other. I can handle mistakes- even frequent ones but the restaurant staff does absolutely nothing to make up for their mistakes. No discounts, no offer for a cup of coffee while we wait, not even an offer for water. We come here so damn often so it is incredibly frustrating they don't offer good customer service.   Management - there's this new woman ruling the roost up front and she certainly isn't the most pleasant person I've met. Pretty rude in general to customers but then today I watched an Amazon order get dropped off. \"Good morning ! I have some packages for you\" said the delivery man. \"Really???? On a Sunday?\" She rolled her eyes didn't thank them and was just a total witch to be honest.   I'm frankly just pissed off that my experience here this morning has me questioning whether I'll go back- a few little changes on their part and I would have left a happy customer.  Now that my rant is over- the food is pretty great. We don't stray away from the breakfast chimi or the corned beef very often because they're our favorites but we have dabbled and tried a few other dishes but we always come back to those two choices. They also have a pretty great juice bar."}
{"text":"This is a great independent breakfast/lunch spot in East Mesa. I was in the area with some friends and we decided to try it. It is very popular as we waited for a while and there were still people lined up when we left at 1:00PM. (They are open from 7AM-2PM daily)  To drink I had the Georgia peach iced tea. Light peach flavor black tea, unsweetened. It was nice and refreshing. To eat I had the PCH Benedict.  Basically a salmon Benedict with capers, dill, poached eggs and hollandaise. I would order it again, absolutely delicious!  From looking around at what other people were ordering, I want to go back soon!  Everything looked amazing!  So many things I want to try!   They also have nice drink menu with mimosas, bloody Mary's, etc.   If you are out in the East valley and looking for a great breakfast spot, be sure to try Sunnyside!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant negative stars I would. The waitress was so rude. The one with glasses. I was trying to write a tip but the pen didn't work so I was scribbling on the receipt for the pen to work and she cane up and yelled at me and told me to act like an adult and made a scene in front of the whole restaurant. Then she slapped a new pen on the table. As I was walking out she told me to not come back."}
{"text":"Although the food was fine and server was nice, the service was terrible. We began ordering our drinks, a smoothie, Arnold Palmer, and water. The request for water was ignored, iced tea was brought over instead of an Arnold Palmer, and the smoothie was no where in sight. We ordered our food. The server came back with the correct beverage, and still no smoothie, apparently because another person took the smoothie. We were assured the smoothie would come out soon. Our food arrived soon after, and as I prepared my Peach Cobbler Pancakes, the other member of the party realized they brought the wrong Eggs Benedict, so we flagged down the person that brought the food, had them get the correct order and reminded them of the smoothie. We finally received our entire order, and ate!   Overall, the food was nothing special. The potatoes were under seasoned, poached eggs were not poached as specified, and the Hollandaise sauce was barely visible, but the steak and cheese were good. The peaches were not ripe enough to cut through, the pancakes were somewhat undercooked, and there was a piece of plastic in the food.  The other member of the party mentioned they had been there before, and though the food was good, the service still had kinks to work out. I wouldn't recommend this place until they  are more established, and focus more on service and food preparation rather than eye catching esthetics."}
{"text":"Slow service ---very unorganized.  I know they are new but...   Dirty dishes left on the tables after people left their table.  Dirty dishes left on the table while people were paying their bills.  No one seems trained or professional at their job.  We had a waitress, she brought our drinks and took our order then 20 minutes later another waitress came and said \"sorry you had to wait so long, what can I get for you\"  She was apparently unable to see we already had our coffee.   I had a cheese omelet (not on the menu -- I had to ask for it) and it was fine.  My friend had a vegetable omelet and she said it was bland and bad.  The breakfast \"experience\" took over an hour.  Over 30 minutes to get our food.  We had to stand up to finally get a bill. When I went inside there were three young hostesses standing at the hostess stand doing exactly nothing except talking amongst themselves.  People were waiting outside to get a table, there were dirty dishes everywhere but three employees had time to stand around and do nothing.   No one was watching the farm for sure.  As a restaurant owner I see more details perhaps than a normal customer and in this case?  \"A\" for location.  \"B\" for ambiance but the rest will put them out of business within a year.  Sorry Sunnyside, I had great hopes for you but I am going back across the street to the well oiled machine called Nandos Hideaway for breakfast."}
{"text":"Concept is great. Although it's perceived as a \"healthful\" breakfast spot given the juice bar, it would be nice to have more choices that are gluten free maybe. Service was nice both times I've been here. The egg white vegetable omelet and the kale salad had all the ingredients to make for a great meal. But something is always consistently missing. No flavor. Lack of herbs, spices in just about every meal. Asked for salsa to spice it up a bit. My only recommendation to keep this going, it to listen to the feedback and add a little flavor to the meals without going crazy on the salt."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a wonderful experience. We brought our dog and she was more than welcomed. The service was excellent. We received our meal very quickly. The orange juice was freshly squeezed and our meals were very tasty and fresh. We felt welcomed. I would definitely visit this restaurant again."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! The staff is so incredibly attentive to their patrons. We came with a huge party of 24, and our orders were taken very promptly. The food came pretty quickly and all at once. With such a plethora of options, I could hardly decide what to order! Good thing I came with such a large group, as I made sure to grab a bite of everyone around me's plate. I don't think you can really go wrong with any of the options!  I got Mom's Recipe Chilaquiles and it was a wonderfully large portion. (With all the bites I snagged of everyone else's dish, I've got plenty for my afternoon snack!) Aside from this, I really liked my friend's Crabcake Benedict and Savory Crepes.   Coffee is good and strong, and mimosas are perfect ratio of champagne/OJ. Next time I stop by, I wanna try out the bloody Mary's too! Highly recommend this spot! There are frequently special discounts so the price is very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Love the food! I've eaten here at least 10 times. Eggs Benedict, Breakfast Chiai, and juices are awesome. Service is usually slow though so I give it a 3."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Whether it's early morning breakfast or mid morning brunch the food and service is extraordinary. Love the cooler weather dining outside just be sure to get in early. The wait can be long but well worth it."}
{"text":"Second time coming here and it will not be the last! Not only is the food amazing, but their service is unmatched! The staff and owners are so kind and very attentive. Thank you for a phenomenal breakfast!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot for breakfast! The service was quick, and friendly. The food is awesome, and the Bloody Mary's are strong.   My boyfriend and I came in on a Sunday morning after finding out that our usual breakfast spot had an hour wait. We were seated immediately, and greeted by a very friendly server. He was very attentive with refills, as well as checking back to make sure we were happy with our orders.  I had the Butchers Omelette & it was great! My boyfriend had a Chorizo Burrito, and was happy but, wished it was a little bigger. A little pricey for breakfast, but I think it was worth it. I enjoyed the Reggae playing in the background, as well as the décor of the restaurant. All in all, a very good vibe, as well as experience."}
{"text":"I had the PCH eggs benedict and it was out of this world! They use the freshest ingredients and seasonal fruit. I also ordered a miss peachy juice drink and a side of grilled chicken. Both were unbelievable and left me feeling full and healthy. This is the most AMAZING breakfast spot I have ever been too. The service was also outstanding and quick. I would drive from north scottsdale just to come eat here again. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"SO yummy! I have only good things to say about this breakfast/brunch place. There was a bit of a wait but it was 11 am on a Sunday, so that is to be expected. There is plenty of seating so we didn't have to wait too long.  I started off with a Bloody Mary which was fantastic! Not too heavy but plenty of flavor. They also have mimosas and a few other brunch related cocktails. They do have a small lunch menu but breakfast is what they're known for. I had eggs benedict with salmon. No regrets! My boyfriend ordered the banana nutella crepes - I had a bite and will definitely be ordering those next time. Really recommend this place for breakfast or brunch!"}
{"text":"A little on the pricey side for breakfast places but the food is very good. Their orange juice is obviously fresh squeezed and amazing!!  The staff is very friendly but the place is very small and the chairs are not that comfortable. It's very cramped inside but the service has always been superb and fast. However, the wait time is often very long on a Saturday morning and the hosts seem to just stand around instead of lending a helping hand with bussing the tables."}
{"text":"This review will probably hurt me more than the owner simply because I had really HIGH hopes and my experience was LOW! Continue reading for in depth review of Sunnyside Breakfast Lounge.  First and foremost, it's simple and the taste is simple too. It's more of a hipster hip type spot with a ambiance to match the Sunnyside name.. Art, great flowers and a pretty chatty loud environment. It's a great spot to meet up for a simple meal, but a big meal on the menu I would recommend you pass it up.   The prices just do match the quality of food, I've went to cafes and diners with better tasting food and I just can't seem to understand why our check was I believe $55 They're \"signature\" potatoes are just frozen cut potatoes, I can tell because it was obvious. Wasn't steamy hot, fresh or homemade cut. They lack even salt... SALT? And these are your \"signature potatoes? I think not! That's a disappointment!  The service here is great, and the owner even brought out food to my table.  I ordered a drink, and it was unfortunately lacking liquor and consisted of ice an sour flavor. I also got a bloody mary, and it was was basic as the name Mary(sorry Mary's), extremely mediocre and lacked ethnicity. (sigh)  I honestly can not recommend this place and I don't know why it's always pack. It's just not good breakfast food, it's a hype spot. Be careful with hype restaurants, you and I both know how that goes. They are subpar. Check out my collections for GREAT breakfast spots I ganruntee you will find something better in my collections."}
{"text":"We headed to Sunnyside for a Girls' Breakfast Out and had a great time. Our waiter was incredibly attentive and funny. He had a warmness about him that was very inviting and approachable; I really appreciated that! He seemed like he was really hustling for us. Anyways, one of my friends got a smoothie which she seemed to love. They make them with agave nectar, if I'm not mistaken, which is awesome. Makes you feel a little better than them using straight sugar.  My other friend and I both has the Denver omelette. While we both enjoyed it, I'd say it was only a little bit better than IHOP quality. But still pretty good! The potatoes were unfortunately a little dry, but still edible.   We used the Yelp deal where we got $20 for $12. I believe this added great value to our meal and definitely bumped up the star count.   My impression of the restaurant is a good one. I think they're still finding their voice, but the roots they have, like fresh squeezed juice, using agave nectar and infusing local cuisine. I'll definitely have to revisit them in the next couple of months and try something new."}
{"text":"Food is great. Atmosphere could use either music or television sound to drown out the cafeteria like noise and babies crying. Bartender is awesome."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and have never been disappointed. The staff is friendly and provide excellent service. My favorite is the Crab-cake Benedict. Beautifully prepared and delicious!  Great place to take visitors from out of town, the menu has something for everyone! Bon Appetite!!"}
{"text":"First time in since it was the other breakfast place.  Great server (didn't catch her name) and the Bloody Mary was very good.  Portions huge (consider sharing), very nice experience overall ..."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast today and we are seated promptly.Nice looking space with a bar for drinks,smoothies,or just grabbing a bite.I ordered the corner beef hash which comes with poached eggs/hollandaise and home fries.First off,the eggs are badly overcooked...hockey puck hard.I asked for proper poached eggs and our waitress takes my dish to the kitchen.She returns with the same plate(pucks removed)and new eggs plopped on top with a new bath of hollandaise.By now the deep fried \"home fries\" are getting spongy.Was surprised brkfst did not come with toast(reason for hard eggs?).Wife's skillet was OK,but don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Great little spot- would highly recommend going here. They have great service, delicious food and a cute comfy location. We also were pleased with the yelp deal we bought that even made this little spot more affordable! Will be back!"}
{"text":"They just opened in the Egg and I location. They are slammed and the wait is loooong for food.  The smoothies are very good and fresh.  They made the space open and nice with an open kitchen.  I'll give them the benefit of doubt for the wait bc it's new.  Onto the food. Not too shabby, spice level very low, salt level very low befitting the hood.  It's better than what was there before and I'll give then another shot.  I hope they spice up the food a bit once they settle in!"}
{"text":"Tree hugger juice with nopales is amazing, you won't find anything like it this far east in Mesa. Spicy chicken sandwich. yes. Whatever salad I got with chicken, yes. I've had breakfast there before too and yes. All yes all the time. Service and decor is on point ^from years ago  From recently: Potatoes clearly cooked from frozen (which is fine, I just don't want to be able to taste the freezer!) and our waitress was basically useless. She didn't remember anything we asked for and just gave us a blank stare when we told her the gravy on the biscuits wasn't edible."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite breakfast and lunch spots. I love the interesting food combinations, and the variety of drinks to choose from. I've never had an issue with the service. We always sit outside (although this might change in the summer) since it does seem fairly loud inside. The only thing I would like to be different is for their bread pudding to be served warm. I love bread pudding and I think theirs would be great if it were not cold."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local spots to go to! I always get the Chorizo Benedict and I am never disappointed! The specialty coffee are delicious as well! I'll always keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Peach Pancakes are not good. They basically crumbled. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I loved the fact that my water was always filled...HOWEVER::::: our waiter was very stand-off-ish and very antisocial. The food was okay but soggy. And false advertising on the front of the menu!!!!!!! ALSO::: I asked for nutella sauce and got normal chocolate sauce. Not a big deal, yes I know...BUT when you expect nutella and get some other bull crap garbage...wth"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great staff, lots of options, and just a nice environment. We came for the coupon, we've returned for everything else. It's our favorite local breakfast spot now."}
{"text":"I got the chorizo Benedict and It was delicious. Also great fast and friendly service! Awesome environment and decor. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I am troubled by the poor reviews! This is a great breakfast place. I have always had an excellent meal, the coffee is good and they have flavored creamers! Food is fresh and they make their own sausage and chorizo. They have a wide variety of juice concoctions if you like that sort of thing.  Oh, and you can get Mimosas!  They are very tech savvy with the order taker using a tablet - welcome to the present! The staff are friendly and keep your coffee cup full. See Luis or Jamie - super friendly wait staff make the visit so much more enjoyable. You can't give a low rating because a place is busy folks!"}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfast.  We recommend the Sonoran crepes and the breakfast chimi.  We cleaned our plates!  Owner stopped by to say hi.  Very nice staff, clean, tasty.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Busy breakfast and well worth the wait!! Food service was fast, friendly and delicious. I had the   Savory Sonoran crepes. Outstanding!!! I want to make this at home. Want an amazing taste in every bite. I will be back for sure.   Ok just came back for round two! I had the same thing as last time because it was so amazing. This time I added a side of corned beef hash....outstanding. Probably the best I have had."}
{"text":"We love this place.  The food and service is some of the best in the valley.  The breakfast portions are substantial.  I love the chimi supreme with green chili salsa."}
{"text":"The service was good. Our server was really sweet! The food was no better then mediocre. I got the crab cake Benedict and I didn't really enjoy it. I've only had crab cake once before and fell in love with it so I thought it would be similar but that's probably not fair since the restaurant I had it at prior was pretty more fit for foodies and definitely seems like they have a higher budget (no disrespect). The potatoes it came with honestly tasted like they were microwaveable so I left that alone on my plate. The toast was drenched in butter that gushed out as soon as you but into it. My guy got the full garden omelet and that was okay. I guess you can't really expect an explosion of flavor with something more appealing to dieting. Water was definitely tap. We also got the fruit bowl ... that was great! They had a selection of fruits like kiwi, pineapple, strawberry, melon dew, and I think apples with cottage cheese and granola to top it off."}
{"text":"Decent place for breakfast. Not fantastic by any means but the outdoor seating and quick service was a welcome positive. Standard breakfast was good but nothing special. I'd come here again just for a simple quick eat."}
{"text":"Had a coupon that I wanted to use. Boy, am I glad I did! We had lunch on this visit but I look forward to going back to try breakfast. Great food, good service, and a nice atmosphere. I will recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Great spot! Had fantastic service, very attentive and up beat. Food was great, portion size just right. I had the lox eggie benedict and it was absolutely delicious. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The service we have had each time we go here is great! The special juices we've tried were mostly good. The food is fairly good too. The prices for the juice are too high but the rest seem reasonable. I'm giving it 4 starts because although I've liked my good my eggs were a bit over cooked and my husband did not like his bagel at all. Also, they shouldn't call something a chimi if it doesn't come fried for the original price, that is called a burrito!"}
{"text":"Went in as a single. Very friendly and attentive staff. The food is wonderful and they have a lovely view. They gave me a huge complimentary ice tea to go."}
{"text":"What an adorable little breakfast and lunch place! We had a Groupon and an early Sunday morning, they had just opened, spotless and inviting. I had an eggs Benedict  that was delicious. Nice twist on the usual. Husband had a spicy omelette with chorizo and potatoes with peppers and onions, he loved it. Service was excellent, everyone very friendly and we will be back! I wish they had a website with the full menu easy to read though."}
{"text":"Great food and service. The bloody Mary's were ok .. Not $7 bucks worthy!  The kids meal was perfect portion and prepared with the same effort as the adult meals.   We both enjoyed the sornoran crepes which were absolutely wonderful. Rich. Flavorful. Different.   I used the Yelp Deal! $12 for $20!"}
{"text":"Been there 2-3 more times since my initial review.  The food just does not have much taste and the service is very slow for the number of customers that are in there.  There are far better options in our neighborhood"}
{"text":"Wondering dining experience.  Well priced, attentive service, and they have one of the best corn beef hash place around (Corn Beef/Benedict hybrid..YUMMY)."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here on Sunday morning. No wait seated right away waitress was very nice. I ordered a mimosa and when it arrived it was not cold I had to put some ice from my water in it. When my breakfast arrived it arrived cold. The waitress did not come back to check on us and we had to wait a really long time to get the check. I was not impressed and probably will not be back."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness. The food here is SO fresh and delicious. This place is sort of out of the way but I had time to kill and decided to stop by and I will definitely make time to come back!!"}
{"text":"Sunnyside is delicious. I was surprised to see negative reviews because I've been there 4 times and every time it was a 4-5 rating. Chorizo breakfast burrito was very tasty.  Love the pancakes and ordered the chorizo omelet late visit which was very good. Food is fresh and wait staff is very friendly. Kid friendly atmosphere.  I would recommend this place over Nandos breakfast or any other breakfast spot in the area."}
{"text":"Met up with my friends today to try Sunnyside for the first time. I ordered the Butcher's Choice Omelette which consists of: chorizo, ham, bacon, sausage, and cheese. I got an orange juice as well. My food was good, and would go back. The only drawback to me was the $4.75 Orange juice w/no refills. Like how is my drink almost half the cost of my entree???"}
{"text":"Omelettes are perfectly prepared and everyone at our table for 10 enjoyed their meal. Bloody Mary's were incredible."}
{"text":"Have to say I will not be coming back because I had the bagel sandwich and it wasn't even bagel dough, it was a crumbly bread. I also has Ala cart biscuit and gravy and the gray was over salted. I took one bite and the server still charged me for it after I told her it was not good. My husband had the chicken fried steak and it was thick in grease. Yes I can see this may not be a good day, because every restaurant has their bad days but it was enough to not come back."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Waited 20 min. for our coffee/tea. No waitress, nothing showed up, we left. Our entire section seemed not to have a waitress.  There was help in other areas of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Best breakfast/brunch/lunch place ever! Awesome atmosphere. Everything on the menu is great!"}
{"text":"Ordered the banana Nutella walnut crepe. That was NOT Nutella. It was a cheap chocolate syrup. Will not be returning to that restaurant. I cannot stand false advertisement."}
{"text":"Wow.  Good food, good service,  great value with the Yelp coupon. Fresh fruit perfect, eggs cooked as ordered,  can't go wrong kind of place."}
{"text":"We held a surprise bridal shower here on saturday for 22 people, they were amazing, food was fantastic, service was stellar the bride was over the moon. thankyou thankyou"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE. It used to be my brunch place during the weekends but the service is very very poor now days. The expresso machine broken for weeks ( according to a waitress), no enough people in the kitchen or in the floor taking orders or cleaning. Good thing there are a lot of choices for brunch in East Mesa!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Healthy options. Fresh ingredients. Friendly staff. We need more places like this in East Mesa."}
{"text":"The best breakfast in Mesa. The staff is AMAZING!!! I would recommend Sunnyside Trio, breakfast chimi, and definitely the bloody mary"}
{"text":"This was an awesome brunch spot. I got the crab cake Benedict with a side of seasoned fries--I highly recommend it. The food was delicious and the portions were a nice size. There's ample seating with an outdoor seating option as well. We went for a friends birthday for a party of 15 and they were able to accommodate us."}
{"text":"Decided to give it a try & we were not disappointed.   Great food & great service.   I loved the variety of drinks. Them adding the lounge part to the place was smart. They have something for everyone. Fresh juiced drinks with kale, ginger, apples etc. or you can have an alcoholic beverage. They offer delicious Bloody Mary's, mimosas, and beer on tap.   The food was outstanding. I got the Philly Benedict. Tasty! My boyfriend ordered Chicken Fried Steak. The gravy was made from scratch. You can tell they pay attention to every detail when it comes to their food. Quality is what keeps the place packed with customers.   The staff was friendly and made us feel welcomed. We will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Came here today and got take out with my sister. I have to say I really enjoyed it! And for take out I think that's saying something!   I ordered a Denver omelette with home fries and I really enjoyed the omelette. It was hot and pretty big. I would definitely order that again. I also ordered a side of bacon that was just so so but anymore I think most bacon is just so so.   My sister got a bagel and cream cheese and enjoyed it.   I have to say the host was so sweet and helpful. Great customer service. He was a young guy with glasses and very nice!   I'm glad I came in and I will again!"}
{"text":"Crab cake eggs Benedict was the best Benedict I've ever had!!! Wish there was a Long Beach, ca location."}
{"text":"Where do I start..... Our first and last time coming here. We put in our name to be seated and were told it would be a 20 minute wait. They then stopped seating people because the kitchen was too backed up. We sat near the podium waiting for our name to be called. They started seating people again at which point I noticed they took 2 large groups who got there after us. I went up to the podium and they stated they called us a while ago....we were sitting there the entire time, they never once called us. We were told that we we're next, ok fine. We ordered our food and waited for it to arrive. As soon as the plate was put in front of my husband there was a noticeable large black curly hair on his food. He didn't take a single bite. I lost my appetite after that and my husband got up and left. I spoke with the manager who apologized and who seemed nice but like she didn't really know what was going on. We left and walked out after being there for an hour. I will never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is very nice, good way to start the day special if you are on holiday! The Breakfast Chini with chorizo was super good!!!! I wish I had safe space for crepes with Nutella, because they look awesome... The only down it was the waiter, a bit rude and with attitude, but don't worry about it the food is worthy some long faces!"}
{"text":"SO. GOOD. I found this place after reading all the positive Yelp Reviews and it did not disappoint! I had the Banana Nutella crepes which were filling, but not in an overly sweet or fattening way. My boyfriend had the Mr. Meaty skillet and, unlike a lot of other restaurants, they didn't scrimp on their meat or cheese. Everything tasted so fresh and delicious! Although we had some of their more indulgent options, there is still an appetizing selection of gluten free and vegetarian options to choose from. The service was fast and friendly, but didn't make us feel rushed. The overall vibe is high-class comfort food without the high-class price tag. We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast, ever?  No, but worthy of a solid four-star review for the following reasons; excellent, friendly & fast service on a busy Sunday morning for a party of eight, which included two three year-olds (thanks Krista), relaxing inside or comfortable patio seating (outside for us on this unseasonably cool late May morning), fair prices, breakfast/brunch cocktail menu (not typical outside New Orleans), unique breakfast/brunch menu options with a southwest flare (Sonoran crepes for me) and gluten-free offerings, just in case.  Oh, the Yelp 20% discount with \"check-in\", doesn't hurt either!  Had the biscuits and gravy (just so-so) been as good as the crepes, breakfast chimi, gluten-free waffle or eggs Benedict, I would have been obligated to award the coveted full five-stars.    Bottom-line, SBL is a great breakfast/brunch option in the far East Valley!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast joint in the East Valley IMO!  Great food along with outstanding and friendly service."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out... I got the biscuits and gravy while my dad got the chicken fried steak. I was so disappointed! And for the first time ever... I only ate a couple of bites and then gave up on my meal. I've never seen this before, but the gravy was oily. You could see the little pools of oil sitting in the gravy. Also - no sausage in the gravy that was advertised as \"sausage gravy\". The potatoes were barely warm cubes... The biscuits were like little hockey pucks.   The chicken fried steak wasn't much better. Same oily gravy. My dad said that it tasted old... My mom had a taste and said it tasted like chemicals?? She actually spit it out into her napkin.   My mom did enjoy her egg white omelette. Kinda hard to mess that up! The waitress was VERY nice and took my meal off the tab as she noticed I hadn't eaten any of it. But all in all, very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Everything's great! Food, service, ambiance...it's all good! Love the Chorizo Benedict."}
{"text":"I rather eat here than the other place. They have a seriously tasty chicken fried steak and eggs! Go eat there...tomorrow morning!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Basic breakfast and good coffee.  I guess I know why there are plenty of seats at 9 AM on a Saturday. Try the Red Mtn cafe.  It is short on atmosphere but the food is much better."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I come here every week. Sometimes twice a week. We love the food here, it is always consistently great! There are sometimes a wait for parties bigger than 4. But they get you to the table quick. The food is definitely great! And the alcoholic drinks are amazing!!! Great place!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food is delicious and the service great. You won't be disappointed with anything you eat. I personally love the Corned beef hash....yummmmmy."}
{"text":"Omgee sooo good! Had their special Crab Cakes Benedict and little sister had the waffles. Mimosa was nice and refreshing. Will have to try the hangover next time. Yummm!"}
{"text":"unfortunately not much lived up to expectations. I try not to hammer a spot for service but it was constantly obsolete.  was not greeted once sat for almost 10 minutes as a waitress walks past us at least 5 or 6 times. finally another waitress , apparently ours shows up. ok, rough start but hopefully things get better. so we get our coffee,  my friends coffee get ruined not once but twice with spoiled creamers. I mean, who needs coffee with breakfast right....... so our food shows up finally and the biscuits and gravy is average but not bad. my waffle and bacon was pretty delicious,  really the only saving grace and why I didn't give 1 star. bad service continues,  wait so long for the check had to start the jokes of just leaving lol unfortunate experience"}
{"text":"Very cute place. Our hotel waitress was super nice and attentive to our furry baby out on the patio. We had corned beef hash and eggs Benedict that were delicious. Bloody Mary's we're pretty amazing also."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I have had in a while!  Ordered the Mobster Omelet that was on special and it is seriously the best omelet that I have ever ordered.  My daughter thought the same and just wanted to eat my food and not hers. They need to add this as regular menu item!  Anyway, she ordered scrambled eggs with fresh fruit and toast.  The eggs were good (average) until she tried my omelet (haha).  The fresh fruit was cold, ripe and tasty.  I hate when you order fresh fruit and they just stick unripe and inedible fruit on the plate.  Not here, It was ripe and tasty like you would expect fresh fruit to be. Also, the toast and English muffins were fresh and hot along with the fried potatoes.  Everything was fresh and hot.   It was a fantastic day to sit on the patio and we enjoyed the super great service you get here every single time.  I have written reviews where the food wasn't good but the service is always AAAA plus.  I don't know how they find the servers but they are upscale all the way!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for breakfast.   She had chorizo Benedict and I had a rocky point omelet.  Both excellent.  I had OJ and she had an ice tea. My wife goes thru ice tea quick and our server Nicole always had it filled which is rare for any server at any place to keep up with my wife's refills,,, Nicole was an excellent server.  Ambiance was great.  They have a nice breakfast bar to go along with the pretty murals on the walls."}
{"text":"The first time was great. The second time..not so much and this 3rd and final time SUCKED. Sunnyside Breakfast Lounge is nothing special, honesty Denny's is better. The service was slow, getting excuses from the server, drinks took over 45 minutes to get. Breakfast came out the same time as our drink and it was cold. We've decided that we'll never go back again. They have not only lost a customer, but we'll tell everyone we know how bad it has been consistantly."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place I've been to in the south west!!! The service was immediate and courteous. The food was AMAZING and prices very reasonable. I'm surprised the place wasn't overrun! I will be returning very soon!!!  This crepe was light and fresh fruity rather than a sugar dump mmmmm!"}
{"text":"I don't know where all those high reviewers ate, but it definitely was not at this restaurant. I ordered the special of the day.  It came with sausage gravy that was so soupy it ran on my eggs, potatoes and toast (all the food was piled on one plate).  The country potatoes were seasoned only with salt. The portion size was ample, which is why I gave it two stars.  It was so cold in the restaurant, that every employee wore a long sleeve jacket but when I asked our server to turn up the heat she said, \"it takes to long to warm it up in here\"...."}
{"text":"I've had breakfast here 3 times now. I love the bar with options like mimosas or Bloody Mary. Their eggs Benedict is great. I had biscuits and gravy this time. It tasted good but wasn't very hot. I asked for a side of gravy and that was hot so it made my meal better. I order sausage on the side. It was barely browned at all so I only had a bite. Next time I will just ask for extra browned sausage. We had good service!  I'd definitely go again and again."}
{"text":"This place was decent. Has a fun vibe and atmosphere. They do have gluten free options for pancakes. The food was good, little pricey for what it was but still good! The bacon was delicious and the food portions were decent size. We also saw they have a lot of fresh juices to choose from as well. We will probably come back again and try something new!"}
{"text":"I love to have my breakfast here! I've made it a habit to get a side of French toast and also the Nutella pancakes. They are so delicious. The service is pretty good, however if you roll in around 1:45 right before they are about to close you might get an attitude from a server that was just cleaning up and ready to go home... Cough, cough... No fingers pointed... But I'm not going to judge a restaurant based on someone's bad day. Overall you will always have a pleasant experience here... Oh and try their fresh fruit smoothies! Simply fresh and amazing!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with our meal. We ordered biscuits and gravy because of the high reviews. As soon as they brought out our plates I didn't even want to try it. The gravy looked like it was curdled and really greasy. The taste was awful. I couldn't eat it. Luckily we both ordered side of eggs and bacon so we managed to eat our sides instead. I've had better biscuits from the freezer section of the grocery store. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for brunch... coffee is excellent, their rocky point omelette is delicious, but I think my favorite was the brave banana pancakes (every single bite is pure deliciousness)...last but not least the service is excellent..."}
{"text":"i thought the food was tasty but was disappointed that they didn't offer lower calorie options, such as turkey sausage or sugar free jellies."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, great drinks! Family friendly place for everyone. Come here and check it out. Plus the have 20% discount when you check in with Yelp!"}
{"text":"We went here for brunch. Everything was amazing. I had the Sonoran crepes and a bloody mary. I asked them to make it spicy. This is the best bloody Mary I have had.  The crepes were soo good I finished every last bite. Reasonable prices also.  Our total bill was around $30 not including tip. That included 1 entree, alcohol beverage and 2 kids meals. I will be going back in the near future."}
{"text":"This cute little breakfast and lunch spot is one of the very few places in town to score vegan breakfast!!!   They offer both vegan waffles and vegan pancakes (both are also gluten free).  I get them topped with bananas and walnuts but they also offer a berry mixture.   Although the husband isn't much of a breakfast food guy, he really enjoyed his traditional breakfast here.   Definitely Check this place out if you're in the area"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Great food and better bloody Mary's. It gets crowded on the weekends for breakfast but the patio offers a great place to sit even if the view is of the parking lot :)"}
{"text":"What a dramatic turnaround.  The new GM john has done an excellent job of turning this place around.  All I ask for is good service and good food for my money.  I had to give this place one more try.  I returned with my wife and bro and we were all impressed with the food and service.  I will definitely return and highly reccomend this place.  Say hello to John the new gm."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time eating here and it's a hit and miss kind of place.  First time I had the chicken fried steak which was OK, not the best in the world.  Missing some flavor and wish the meat was bigger.  The second time I ate here I got the Eggs Benedict with the Salmon. The Salmon tasted great and that's coming from someone who cooks his own salmon on a regular basis. Everything tasted great and the only complaint I have is I wish there was more Hollandaise sauce.  It was lacking that, plus I ordered a side of bacon that never came.  The prices are far but for the same money you could probably find a better place.  All in all,  I would eat here again and maybe I'll be more specific on how I want my food."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Quick and friendly service. Our food was served exactly as ordered and HOT!  We will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I are new to Arizona so we're searching for good places to eat.  We tried this place for breakfast and I got the breakfast chimi (which is a breakfast burrito) and it was great.  It's also across the way to our favorite Italian restaurant Pacino's."}
{"text":"1st time here while visiting family. The service was great and the food was delicious. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Big disappointment. I had a Denver omelet, which was decent - not outstanding, but ok. But - it was 12 bucks, and came with very generic \"institutional-grade\" toast, and the \"home fries\" were obviously frozen and were utterly tasteless. Sorry guys, but if you're going to charge top-tier prices, you have to deliver a better experience than that. The potatoes were absolutely inexcusable. Some nice fresh hash browns or other non-frozen potato side would have made a huge difference. And the bread could use an upgrade too. Or, charge about $7 and leave everything as-is, and it would be about right. $32 before tip for breakfast for 2, a painful hit to the wallet for a marginal meal. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast spot in Mesa! If you are in the Mesa area this is a must hit. Their chilaquiles are excellent. Also they have a good variety so if you don't want something southwestern style you can get your usual breakfast favorites! Love their check in offer as well!"}
{"text":"I have been coming back here BC its close to where I just moved to. I really like most of the food especially the pancakes. Too many for one person to eat but so yummy. The service has always been top notch also.  Im just not a fan of their gravy. Its def their own spin not traditional. And I've also had better bigger portion for the same price range.  That is the only reason for 4 stars. Ill keep coming back BC its the best 5 min away from me and they have French vanilla creamer, fresh squeezed oj.  Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"This time we went back and two of employees recognized me and greeted us promptly. The food, service, atmosphere,  TV, execution of food were pefect.  It is always nice to be treated like VIP here."}
{"text":"Delicious and unique southwest menu. I can't think of anything I dislike. Try their specialty breakfast drinks; they are a fun treat."}
{"text":"This is such an underrated breakfast spot! The food is extremely well portioned, delicious and fresh! The service alone is one of the best experiences I have ever had, they are more than polite, professional, and helpful with any questions! I have always been satisfied and full after coming here and crave it as soon as I leave. Their curly fries are to die for! The PCH benedict is out of this world and their oatmeal is a meal on it's own! I definitely recommend coming here on a day where you have time so you can sit outside and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere! I haven't eaten something I didn't like! If you're ever in the area you need to stop by!"}
{"text":"Whoever makes the Bloody Marys is the real MVP. A group of friends and I rented an Air B&B for the weekend and joked about renting that person for the party, lol.  Aside from day drinking, I guess the food was good too. ;) I would recommend checking them out. The place is small so be prepared to wait a bit before being seated."}
{"text":"This place is not forever burned into my memory as exceptional dining. However, the food was hot and fairly good. The menu was diverse with a good variety of most typical breakfast staples. I would give the food 3 1/2 stars as it was better than just edible, however, the food was not memorable. Nor is this a spot I would likely suggest to someone in the area. The bar menu showed some creative drinks but I was there with co-workers in the middle of my work day, so I didn't sample any drinks. Ultimately the food is decent but over-priced for what it is, standard breakfast fare with no twist or exceptional execution.   However on the day of our visit, mid-week, it was extremely slow with few guests but it took a painfully long time to order and receive our food.   I am willing to chalk up the visit as possibly a fluke and may in the future will give them a try in the future."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food! Got chicken fried steak, and it was fantastic... secure was fast and friendly, and would recommend to anyone.."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident. Great menu. We have been traveling for nearly twelve months and breakfast choices get very repetitious so we were delighted to eat here. Great fresh juice for a start. My partner had the muffuletta and tho not quite the NOLA  experience it was really good. I had the chorizo hollandaise poached eggs with pepper house potatoes. I couldn't fault it. I would eat here again in a heart beat. Nice atmosphere and great staff."}
{"text":"Third time is a charm? In this case, yes! I've eaten breakfast here twice before and both times left feeling like I spent a lot of money for nothing special. The first time I had one of the Benedicts and it was a soggy, coagulated mess of bland flavors. I'm not a fan of the bread they use at all, either. The second time, I don't even remember what I had but both myself and my son left disappointed.    Sunnyside is SO very close to my house that I decided just ONE more time I'd check it out. I'm hungry, lazy, and need fat girl comfort food, okay? Don't judge. I ordered the Savory crepes without jalapenos or the nopales. Still a bit spicy, but not over the top. So flavorful and rich. The crepes give it a very slight sweetness and the chorizo blends perfectly with the hollandaise. For $11.50+ a tip, I had an incredible breakfast and am stuffed. I'm going to leave it at a 3 star A Ok instead of the 1 star I had intended, just because of this dish. I' definitely go back and have it again. Now please excuse me while I do a #fatgirlhappydance."}
{"text":"Love the staff...consistently good food. Not crowded 1st thing in the morning and dogs are welcome outside!"}
{"text":"The Valley of the Sunnyside omelette with a side of chicken was amazing! Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast. Had eggs, bacon and pancakes. Yummy!! Very reasonably priced.  Pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here with my husband on my birthday. This place was ok, nothing special. Food was average. Service was great, but won't be back."}
{"text":"Nice service, no lunch variety,  great vegetables juice. 3 stars for little choices in lunch menu ."}
