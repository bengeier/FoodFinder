{"text":"Went to K-pop chicken again and AGAIN another good quality delicious food with great service and good portion!! I am going to try their Beer chicken as they recommended it to me for next time! 
It's awesome to have Korean style chicken near my place. 
Please stay like this!!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to come here for awhile because I live right by here, but I just never had the chance up until a week ago.  K-POP Chicken replaces the old Billy Jack's Po Boys.  This was my first experience with \"korean style fried chicken\". 

The inside basically looks the same as it did when it was Billy Jack's.  There are now 2 flat screen televisions mounted on the walls at each end that play K-pop music, which is pretty cool.

2 of us ordered the half-chicken sized bites in the Soy and Garlic flavour and one of us ordered the half-chicken sized bites in medium hot.  Our waiter told us that the half size would be more than enough for each of us,  We also ordered an egg roll to share.

Honestly, maybe the 3 of us just eat alot, but I really felt like the half chicken portion was pretty small to be eaten as a main for one person.  I found myself hungry after I had finished it and luckily the egg roll came.  I could have easily eaten the full size chicken of the chicken bites.  As for the bites themselves, they were really good.  I don't have anything to compare them to but the sauce was thin and flavourful but didn't drown out the slight crispiness of the skin.  I would totally come back for the chicken but just order it in a full size.

Also, your chicken order comes with a free salad.  I thought this meant for each of us a small salad, but he brought out one plate for the 3 of us to share and honestly it was not a very large portion.  The 3 of us only ended up having a really small amount each. 

The egg roll was basically an omlette covered in ketchup and another sauce.  It was good, but didn't blow me away.  The chicken was definately the best part.

The service was very friendly but as a couple of others have noticed I think there may have been a very small language barrier.  There were only a couple things forgotten like my dad's beer which he brought after reminded but forgot a glass :).  Just little things, but it's not really a big deal, you just have to be clear.

Overall, the standout for me was the chicken (as it should be! This is a chicken place!).  There is nothing else comparable to this in Etobicoke so I will come back.  Little things could be improved on like possibly portion sizes and service, but I will be back to try some of the other flavours of chicken they have."}
{"text":"great chicken worth the visit, nice place to grab a beer and some fried chicken."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner.
The fried chicken is great, tastes fresh and is super crispy. You get quite a lot of chicken too!
We were given some popped corn, salad, and picked radish.

I love the cup bab special. Only about $6 for a big bowl that comes with a fried egg, rice, glass noodles, chicken, fried chicken, and some veggies. Also included is a pop. Great deal if you live in the area, but I wish the cup bap was always available because it's so yummy.

The service has always been really quick and without any problems.

I hope in the future they add more variety of chicken dishes. I love Korean food and would love to see some combination of the fried chicken in other ways, like how it's done with the cup bap."}
{"text":"Probably THE best fried chicken in the GTA.

Very friendly and helpful staff. The chicken was amazing, not greasy, or dry.  I've really never had better fried chicken (Korean or otherwise)."}
{"text":"Friendly service but didn't induce craving for fried chicken. Needs a better selection of beers. Lunch bowls are good value for money."}
{"text":"I was in for something to fill me up after a semi-unsatisfying meal so I decided to try this place out! 

Soy & Garlic Chicken wings (4/5): YUM! As another yelper described, its a thin sauce, however super flavourful. It's got a good hint of garlic but surprisingly on the sweet side considering it's counterpart is soy! The wings seem alittle small at first, but the juicyness and flavour will definitely satisfy :) Would come back again to try their other flavours!

Cost (3.5/5): $11.99 for 10 wings is pretty standard. No complaints here!

Service (5/5): The aspect I didn't expect from this place was the great service we received. As soon as were seated we were asked if it was our first time here. As soon as we replied yes, the waiter then went to explain to us very kindly the 4 different flavours they had to offer and type of chicken they cook. It was very welcoming :) Table service throughout the meal was wonderful and with good food we certainly left happy customers.

Ambiance (4/5): Very simple layout. Nothing too fancy, missed match chairs at some tables, 2 booths, and a bar area. There are 2 large TVs in the restaurant that broadcasted korean entertainment throughout the dinner so it was an interesting almost outside-of-Canada-feeling haha. Though I gotta say the ladies washroom was spotless. Impressive!

Overall a great pick if you're in the area. I'd definitely return to try more flavours!"}
{"text":"delicioussss cup bab sold out a little early though. def would eat again"}
{"text":"So happy to find this little place! We were craving for 'chicken & beer' & this is the perfect spot. I wish they have more beer selection like the Japanese or Korean kind but I know it won't sell as much as it would in Yonge and Finch or Bloor. It wasn't busy because Korean food is not big on this area. We had the 3 different flavours (sweet&spicy, soy&garlic, soy&green onion) and we love it all. It was tasty, not that oily or heavily breaded, just how chicken should be done. If you are still having pizza pizza chicken wings or any fast food chicken (although popeye's spicy wings are good!), you should give this a try, you might not want to go back to buying those! We didn't mind the Kpop playing because we watch a lot of Korean stuff anyway. We'll be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"K POP Chicken is as good as it gets. The fried chicken here is just so damn JUICY!! My husband and I ordered the MIXED K pop Chicken so we got a taste of most of the flavours they offer. From Garlic Soy, to Green onion, to spicy, mmm:) I'm drooling just thinking of it. The prices are pretty reasonable for the quality of food that you get. With our mixed chicken we were given a garden salad to start with, and a giant bowl of pickled radish to accompany the chicken. 

On top of all of it, the service is really great here, they are definitely on point. From the friendly smiles you get all around to the little lady who brings out your food with a giant smile on her face :).

The location is a little far west for some people, but honestly worth the trek. It's less than a 5 minute walk away from islington station, situated right in front of goodlife. But don't worry it will taste so good you won't regret not going to the gym that day ;)."}
{"text":"Had a craving for some KFC (Korean fried chicken), so I needed to check out K-POP.  I'm glad that it was takeout because their AC was broken.  Still, the place was pretty hoppin'.  As for the food, it was pretty good. Got half of the green onion fried chicken and  half of the medium spice fried chicken. As other Yelpers mentioned, the portions are generous (my wife and I could only finish half of our order).  What sets K-POP apart from other KFC joints is the price. I would say that for the same order I saved about 10 bucks. I ended up paying $28 including taxes.  I know, this sounds a steep price to pay but Korean fried chicken is generally expensive, but so worth it. Lightly battered and fried to perfection, these nuggets (some bone-in) are topped with a yummy variety of sauces. You really can't go wrong. And since Koreans don't like grease, KFC is always served with a side of radish kimchi, which is sweet and vinegary, and complements the chicken perfectly.  At some places, the radish kimchi is too sweet, but K-POP done it right.  Great job and I hope this place sticks around because there aren't any KFC options in the West end. :)"}
{"text":"I love the food here - the portions are generous, the staff is very friendly and courteous and the food is delicious!

The decor lacks charm but the place is clean and bright. We ordered the traditional fried chicken and soy and ginger wings. The salad and popcorn were fresh and we couldn't decide which type of chicken we liked best, it was that good. 

Please check this place out! I don't want this place to go out of business. The food is amazing and it should be a lot busier than it was today!"}
{"text":"I've had Korean fried chicken at half a dozen other places in the city and I have to say to date, this is the best version I have had in Toronto. 

I have been on a search to find the best Korean fried chicken locally but to date this is the best I've had all around which includes quality, service and value.

I was intrigued to know that a place such as this was now open in such proximity which makes it far more accessible to me than either downtown or the Yonge/Finch area that seems to have so many KFC places up there.  This place has only been open for about a month now.

My server gave me a cup of daikon radish.  I've seen this before which seems to be common among the places I've been.  They also gave me a small basket of popcorn.  I've been to one other place that did this (Ajuker).  I also was given a bowl of slaw type salad.  This one is sort of new, I've had corn before but not here.  Also the water given to me was in a glass, not necessarily the plastic decanter with the blue top which I seem to see at many Korean restaurants.  

I had ordered a Budweiser on tap which they seemed to have 3 common big brand names on tap and Bud was one.  Beer and fried chicken is like bacon and eggs, pork and rapini or chips and dip... they just go together so magically and it's safe to say if you serve KFC, you'd better have beer. 

I read the menu and for the life of me I still can't figure out why garlic soy in some places in Toronto (Home of Hot Taste, Dakgogi) is NOT available for wings but any other sauce just about is... it is confounding to see this flavor is simply NOT an option in some places unless you're ordering a whole chicken.  This restriction to me is like hearing somebody tell me you cannot put Big Mac sauce on a Quarter Pounder with Cheese, it is forbidden.  

I went ahead and asked my server if they could give me wings with garlic soy, expecting some sort of confrontation - hey I was just asking a question.  He said let me check and came back with an astounding YES!  Yes, K-POP will grant me my wish and serve me wings with garlic soy style.  I was thinking to myself what would Katy Perry say if I asked her for a date?  Would John Gibbons let me play shortstop in absence of Troy Tulowitzki?  I felt like a VIP asking for something off the menu and getting it.  I'm special that or they simply wanted to please a customer with a request that's just not unreasonable.

I went ahead and ordered 2 lbs of wings, one with the garlic soy (shh), and one pound plain so I could just have the chicken without any sauce.  My server couldn't do enough for me and he was very attentive.

The chicken came at the same time, both plates, long and ready to be consumed.  I took my obligatory photo snaps of it because you know, I have to document this experience properly but not before accidentally consuming 3 wings.  A close up of each pound and a top view to get perspective.  This is how anxious I was and by the 3rd wing I had already broken the virgin photo integrity by removing what should have been in the shot.

These wings to me completely dwarfed what I had had just a week ago at Dakgogi which was their version of 2 lbs.  Dakgogi served me what seemed to be 8 or so \"NORMAL\" sized wings and when I say normal I mean the kind you buy at grocery stores and when I used to eat when I was a kid when stuff like roids for birds wasn't so common and when there was no recognized so called food crisis.  

I would have to say one pound of wings at K-POP is DOUBLE the meat of what I had at Dakgogi because not only are the wings MUCH more meaty but they also gave me more per pound.  I counted no less than 10 well sized wings on each plate.  The plain were so fresh I had to put them down as I was burning my fingers.  These are the juiciest wings I've had in Toronto hands down.  The garlic soy tasted great but the sauce was thin, light soy and sort of dampened the crisp factor.  There were real slices of garlic on top.  There was enough left over sauce for me to use to dip the plain wings in after.

The chicken had a light batter and was much more juicier than they were crispy.  I'd have to recommend getting the sauce on the side here like many of the other Toronto KFC places as to not \"uncrisp\" the chicken because of the sauce.  The taste of the sauce is great but it did make the outside less crispy.  

Next time I want to try the whole chicken with green onions which looked really good.  The prices are reasonable here but the bigger you go, the more you save.  For instance for the green onion chicken the difference in price between the 1.5 lb and 3 lb is only 8 dollars being 18 and 26 dollars respectively.

Bottom line yes I'll be back because their food is good and as I said the best KFC I've had in Toronto.  The chicken may not be as crispy if sauced but it's very juicy.  Ask for sauce on the side if you want want your chicken to stay crispier.  

They have wet naps.  Many KFC places in TO don't which is just crazy, 4* solid."}
{"text":"Great chicken, definitely on par with other Korean Fried Chicken places if not better. Having popcorn as a side dish is interesting."}
{"text":"Okay, it seems like they've gotten their act together.
Most of my previous review still applies but I will give them this: The Cup Bab has improved. It's a marginal improvement, but progress nonetheless. For one, they are actually frying the egg (not scrambling) which seems more in line with proper Korean food. They also added a glass noodle in addition to the rice. And, they actually encourage you to applying your own sauces to the bowl before you leave. It was better, but I still stand by the fact if they used fried chicken instead of tiny chopped up chicken bits it would be a lot better. 

Also, I will say that the place was clean and workers were attentive, so an improvement over my first visit as well. I'm still hard pressed to go past 3 stars though.

Side note: Beer selection is pretty disappointing after all, so disregard that point from my previous review."}
{"text":"Overall 4.5 stars because we did wait for a while for our food. It wasn't a big deal as my group was just talking within ourselves but part way through we started wondering where the food was.

They serve popcorn as appetizer, and the chicken here is delicious! I had a bit of everything, the boneless chicken with sauce, the fried, and the soy honey garlic one and it was cooked just to perfection in my opinion. In terms of pricing, it was reasonably priced. Cheaper than The Fry in North York and we ordered a similar amount. The staff is pretty easy going and the atmosphere was just right - not too loud or busy so just the right amount. Would not mind coming back here again!

We were late for our reservations and they were okay with it. They also have fries, although it is not explicitly on the menu - they have them!

Note: Free parking at Islington station on weekends and weeknight evenings if you need parking. Or you can just pay for the green p parking right by the restaurant if you really don't want to walk haha."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good chicken. I tried the chicken cup Bab with beef and found it to be well priced and quite filling. The food was prepared quickly and the atmosphere is unique. The menu is a bit too small though. It would be nice if they had more items."}
{"text":"The fam and I wanted some late night fried chicken so we decided to stop by KPOP, as we'd been meaning to check out this place earlier anyways.

I know this is a huge statement but this place served me the best fried chicken I've had in Toronto. Before you all freak out, let me just say that I have several pet peeves about chicken wings at other joints: too oily, too salty, lacking flavour, not crispy enough. 

We ordered the combination plate (it let us try out four different flavours they offer - great for indecisive folks like me), which was sooooo delish. The chicken was crispy and perfectly flavoured and best of all, didn't make me feel like I ate a gallon of *insert name of the gross kind they use at KFC* oil (no offense to KFC lovers). 

Bonuses: gave us complimentary pickled radish (this is KEY), popcorn and salad. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Chicken and beer.  That's basically what you hafta know about K-Pop Chicken.  Free res parking out in back and the fact that it's kitty-corner to Islington Station, also doesn't hurt!

What knocks down points are:
*  friendly service, but not super consistent.  I came here with a party of 8 for a UYE and our orders were taken at different times, so food rolled out at different times, including one that was 30-40mins later
*  waiter misunderstood me a couple of times (slight language barrier, no biggie, but we were brought something we didn't order)
*  'Happy Hour' Special was served on a paper plate...WHY?  Plus the pieces were off-cuts that were not as good as the regular orders.  Pieces had partial bones and were more skin/fat, than actual meat.  Good deal, but please be consistent with what cuts you are offering your customers

Waiter said his favourite was Medium.  However, there wasn't that much of a difference between Medium and Fiery.  Fiery (or whatever the spicy was called) was quite nice, tasted sorta like gojuchang (sweet/spicy Korean sauce).  I also tried the one with sliced green onions and that tasted quite fresh!

Tip:  Skip the 'Happy Hour' and go for the other options as the pieces of chicken will be better!"}
{"text":"Since I'm Korean and have had many MANY experiences with Korean fried chicken, both in Korea and Canada, I would have to say my experience at K-pop chicken was okay - not superb, not horrible. 

I live right by the area, so I decided to call ahead and order some for take-out. I ordered 1/2 Green Onion and 1/2 Sweet & Spicy for three people, and the portions were definitely enough. I liked how the pieces were actually meaty and big, and we were pretty satisfied with both the sauces/flavours.

One thing I was really disappointed in was the pickled radish side dish. Anyone who's had Korean fried chicken knows that a good tastin' pickled radish is absolutely ESSENTIAL. But the taste of the radish was very off, almost as if it were about to go bad but hadn't fully gone there yet. Since I've had it many times throughout my life as a side dish, I know what it's generally supposed to taste like, and theirs was just... weird. Given that other reviewers have had no such problem though, I'd like to think this was a one-time occurrence. Looking back, we should have called them to let them know. 

Overall, I liked the taste and the portions, so I will probably go back to try the other sauces on their menu, and also their on-tap beer (chicken + beer combo is a classic that cannot be beat!). I have high hopes that their pickled radish will be normal next time!"}
{"text":"Juicy, crispy and tasty, just what I am looking for in fried foods and K-POP does not let you down. Had the soy and green onion and the sauced ones, damn tasty stuff, and great value for the dollar, I may just go back tonight!!"}
{"text":"So we ordered the hot sauced full chicken and the portion sizing was great! Service was quick and prompt with complimentary salad and popcorn.  Albeit it was a slow night.  Overall the chicken was fresh, crispy and light.  Really well done on the breading.  I however thought the sauce was too sweet to my liking as it tastes almost like a honey garlic with some chilli sauce mixed in.  Not my cup of tea but my girlfriend liked it.  I feel if I had gotten a lighter sauce or had the sauce on the side I would have definitely enjoyed the chicken more.  Also this place basically only does chicken there isn't much more on the menu but chicken.  It's good they know their strengths.  Would come back."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for take out.  Very good.  The soy and green onion chicken was great. Also had a sweet saucy chicken, slightly spicy.  Wish I asked for very spicy.  Likely because it was late Sunday, there were no sides like salad or rice available.  The only down side was the price.  Not cheap..... but the quality of the chicken was very very good.  Will definitely go back!

***** Just a note, most map apps show this place on the North West quadrant of Bloor and Islington.  It's actually on the south East side next to Orwells, Pizza Pizza, etc"}
{"text":"I missed Lambert's UYE here so I just had to check out K-Pop for myself.

We were able to grab one of the last tables in the tiny dining room.  As we were eyeing the menu and the owner asked if it was our first time.  He recommended getting 1/2 a regular chicken ($14.99) with fries ($4.99) for the two of us.  We were not huge fans of their beer selection but finally succumbed and ordered pints of Canadian ($6).

We enjoyed the free sides - green salad, popcorn and radishes - while we waited for our food.

The chicken was pretty good - the skin was light and not greasy (as the owner had sold us on this) but it wasn't as flavourful or salty as other dirty bird chicken we've tried.  Fries were pretty standard and boring - probably McCain frozen fries - and tasted like onion rings.

We probably could have eaten the whole chicken or maybe the 1/2 chicken with another dish.  

I would gladly come back again when my craving for something deep fried arises.  I highly recommend a better selection of draft beers, otherwise, I'm just going to get water."}
{"text":"We had a 3 lb spicy fried chicken and a 1.5 lb of medium chicken wings. Both were pretty good tho it took a while to cook, maybe 35 mins or so.

Me and my bud aren't korean, But if you are korean you can come in like 10 mins after us and get your food 5-10 mins earlier. Just saying it was pretty obvious. 

I'd recommend takeout."}
{"text":"Came here this past Thursday with a bunch of other Yelpers. I had fairly high expectations given other reviews, and word of mouth, and it mostly lived up to expectations.

ATMOSPHERE:

The place is pretty conveniently located for those living on the west-end, or travelling by subway. There's street parking and Green P's around for those driving in, but seemed to get packed surprisingly fast for a Thursday night. The interior itself is pretty small, but pretty similar to most Korean bars in other parts of town - a few tables, bar area, and a row of booths, and a couple of TV's with K-Pop playing in the background. 

SERVICE:

So the server took a bit on the long side to take my and another's order (ended up needing to go up to the front to catch his attention), but it's possible he didn't notice me coming in. We also had a fairly large table, and our server seemed to be taking care of the whole place while also tending to the bar. I was a bit annoyed when our server also got my order wrong, but he was sincerely apologetic and was quick enough in getting the correct dish over.

FOOD:

I was impressed with friend chicken options and combos available. You can choose from regular chicken (whole and half), boneless chicken, or wings - in numerous sauces that were actually available. They didn't have flavoured soju as I had hoped, but the standard was available, as were beers on tap.

I ended up going with the \"Night Time Special\" (\"Happy Hour\") that was available between 7-11pm. Our whole table was kind of surprised at how good of a deal this seemed to be for $9. Though on the smaller side, the special includes 4 pieces of chicken, fries (or a salad), and a pint of beer - pretty good bang for your buck if you ask me! The fries were nice and crispy (but not oily), just the way I like them. The standard fried chicken was tender, and well-battered, without being too overwhelming. 

I also ordered another half order of \"Soy and Garlic\" wings, which was also pretty good. It was a bit on the soggy side, due to the sauce, and a bit light on flavour.  Although I prefer sauces being more subtle, those looking for heavier/saucier wings might want to dry the \"Hot/Medium\" options.

VERDICT:

Come for the food, be mildly entertained by the K-Pop. I'll be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We ordered the mixed chicken dish to get a taste of everything. Out of all the chicken that it came with, by far the best was the green onion flavour. The spicy chicken was also pretty good. The regular and the soy garlic flavours were okay. They also gave some salad and also radish as a side dish. Overall, the chicken was pretty good but not mind blowing. The inside is pretty basic and they have bar style seating too."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout around 8:30 PM on Saturday evening by calling K-POP, our order was taken down, no problem. We were told it would be ready at 9:10. We drove ~20 minutes because of the good reviews.

When we arrived at 9:15 and indicated our order the woman at the desk began entering it in as a new order. I explained that our order was already taken down and we were here for pickup at 9:10. I was passed on to another gentleman at the counter, who then passed me his cellphone to speak to someone on the other end. That person told me he forgot the order and if I could wait 20 minutes they would prepare it for us there. No apology, no explanation, nothing.

We left and decided to take our business elsewhere."}
