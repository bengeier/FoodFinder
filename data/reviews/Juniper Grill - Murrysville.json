{"text":"Our lunch was delicious and Kelly, our server, was even better. I would especially recommend the rotisserie chicken salad with the killer cucumber wasabi dressing. And the cornbread appetizer is well worth the calories."}
{"text":"The Juniper Grill was a wonderful surprise to find. From the time we walked in the door the staff was helpful, friendly and we had wonderful service. The wait staff as well as the meal were outstanding. Definitely not your usual Pittsburgh menu. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat In Murrysville!! The service can't be beat! Some of the friendliest people I have ever met! Tony Raphael and Glenda are the best! Carrie is one if the sweetest bartenders and her drinks can't be beat! You could not find a better General Manager than Mike!  I have had the short ribs, which were so good I have had them three times there. They are served with Yukon gold mashed potatoes that are so good! I have had the Amish chicken, which is enough to feed two people...absolutely mouth watering!! The baby back ribs are to die for also!! And I have also had the  burger which can't be beat. As you can see, I am already a regular to this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"We are big fans of Juniper Grill, so we took a relative there who had never tried Juniper before.  I made a reservation on Open Table, but when we arrived, there was no table ready for us, and we waited until about 25 minutes PAST our reservation time.  I was disappointed in the first impression that gave to our relative, especially since the waiting area in the front of the restaurant is small and crowded.  Once we were seated, I was surprised by the noise level in the dining room.  One of the things I love about Juniper Grill is the laid-back, relaxing atmosphere, but on the Saturday night when we visited, it was raucous.  Perhaps it was because our booth was located directly behind the host stand, but the noise level made it very difficult to carry on normal conversation.  Our waiter, however, was outstanding.  Jordan was enthusiastic, friendly, and witty.  He was knowledgeable about the menu and specials, and he was quick to notice when we needed fresh drinks.  He took care of us without hovering or smothering.  The food, as always, was outstanding.  Our guest had the fish special, my husband had the brisket, and I had soup and cornbread.  We were all so pleased with our food, and with the service we received from Jordan, but the atmosphere left us wishing for a bit more of what we have experienced in the past."}
{"text":"Second chance visit. Stuck to the very basics, a burger.  Burger was dry, bun was stale, and California burger toppings were so slopped-on it was a mess.  Decided to try the potato salad... Worse I've ever been served anywhere... Mayonnaise and boiled potatoes... Runny and tasteless.  Waitress saw that I ate one bite of the potato salad and didn't offer to exchange with something else or take it off the bill.  Must be used to getting it back uneaten.  Very disappointing...   This was strike two for this restaurant.  It'll be quite a while before I return"}
{"text":"Mac and cheese is a must! Their southwestern flare is great. Music choice was a little up beat, but overall great dining experience. Portion size was also pretty reasonable! Our waiter Steve was very nice and accommodating! Thanks Steve!"}
{"text":"Went here last night with friends, had reservations for 4 people at 7pm. We did have to wait about 20 min, but had a drink at the beautiful bar and the time went quickly. Loved the decor and the atmosphere - very cozy and intimate. We had 2 appetizers: the cheesy bacon dip and the brisket quesadillas- both were excellent! We all ordered specials (filet and the seafood dish) and it was very, very good. Our server Kelly was sweet and attentive. My only mild criticism would have been that we ordered a bottle of wine and it didn't come until after our dinners had been served (slight timing issue) and we would've liked it before. But not a big deal at all.  Loved the Juniper Grill - great date night!"}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times and enjoyed all visits. They have the best key lime pie ever."}
{"text":"Decided to stop on a whim. Not quite sure what style they're going for- it's a combo of bbq and mexican? Interesting. The drinks are fantastic! The salads- not much more than wet lettuce and they were a'la carte. My steak was perfect and the crab cake was great! My husband raved over the mashed potatoes and enjoyed the ribs, although they were on the sweet side. I'd definitely come again."}
{"text":"Decent menu but nothing too spectacular. The cornbread is good but nothing to write home about. The kids menu is pretty basic and my kids weren't overly impressed, except they did enjoy the ice cream. I had the grilled fish tacos, which were pretty good; hubby had one of the BBQ plates, which was just ok. Server was good and efficient. Overall a good meal and experience."}
{"text":"Ok... I would eat here every night if i could. The food is just delicious; love the atmosphere; and the waitstaff are soooo nice. The food is seasoned so well. Definately something special for a nice evening!"}
{"text":"I just went in to this restaurant with my husband and never got waited on. We sat for 10 minutes. The 2 groups who came in after us had water and beverage napkins placed in front of them before they even settled into their seats.  I am one half of a biracial couple and those who filed in after us were Caucasian.  No one ever approached our table.  After 10 minutes of watching everyone else get service, we walked out.  Can't say for sure why this occurred but the obvious difference between us and the other diners certainly makes me wonder."}
{"text":"I have had a consistently great meal every time I come here. They are kid friendly as well and my 4 year old loved her food. Sunday brunch is great and good cocktail selections. Service is really thoughtful and attentive. The brisket sandwich is amazing as are their burgers - which are also made with some brisket mixed in."}
{"text":"My wife and I were hungry and found this nearby on Yelp.  We saw it had 4 stars and decided to give this place a try.  We were pleasantly surprised. When we walked in, the place looked nicer than we expected.  We were seated fairly quickly.  Since it was the weekend they had a special brunch menu.  The price points overall for food were not bad, so that was a plus.   Drinks:  I had the angry mule (basically a moscow mule with jalapeno vodka I think) which was enjoyable and my wife had a grilled pineapple mojito.  4 stars for this. We got a free app of street tacos for checking into yelp.  Since it was a free app, we figured it would be fine, but to our delight they were really good.  They were presented well, had a nice green sauce and a slaw on top. 4.5 stars for this. My wife ordered from the brunch menu and got a skillet.  The skillet was pretty good, but the side she got (roasted brussels sprouts) was even better.  There was a nice flavor on the sprouts as they were roasted with garlic and olive oil.  4 stars for this. I ordered shrimp and crab enchiladas, which came with a side of drunken beans and rice.  This was pretty good, though definitely not a highlight of the experience.  3.5 to 4 stars for this. Service overall was good, polite, patient and water refills were fairly consistent. 4 to 4.5 stars.  Only thing I think they should do to expand patronage is add some PA craft beers on tap.  There are a number of craft beer drinkers who would help expand patronage.  People who drink craft beer definitely are not low on the income scale and will pay $6 for a pint of good beer.  There are not that many places with good PA craft beers on tap on this side of town.  Crave is not as good an overall establishment as Juniper Grill, so I think JG has a real opportunity here that I think would be golden.  Heck, I'd be happy to help make this happen if there was a way for me to do so."}
{"text":"Spent a wonderful evening on Wednesday at my now favorite local restaurant. The service was outstanding, and the food wonderful. I feel it is a bit overpriced, especially their bar wines and drinks. $10 for a glass of house Pinot Noir is way too high. However the fish tacos were fresh, tasty and with a side of black beans and rice were amazing! I will be returning!"}
{"text":"No quality control coming out of the kitchen.  Did a very good job of remodeling the place and the service is very good. I ate here right when they opened a few years ago and it was good.  Since then the food has gotten worse every time we've been back.         The tables around us were sending food back so I thought I'd order safe (one of their standards).  I got the ribs.  They were dry burnt just awful.  They had to of been made several days ago.  The side dishes (oh my).  Do not get the potato salad.  The potatoes tasted like they were frozen and thawed.  The runny white sauce on them is disgusting.  Corn bread so so stale they could of made croutons out of them.   The french fries and macaroni salad were the only edible thing.   I ate there last night and how anyone could of plated my food is disturbing. The waitress was very nice. Avoid this place they will not change and don't want to hear it about the quality of their food This was the 4th last chance and last - they are horrible."}
{"text":"1st visit to restaurant. Private room in back for meeting. Much too warm. Apps were quite good and Prickly Pear martini was tasty and well worth the 5 dollar Thursday special.. (Hint to waitress, don't tell me the draft beer line is clogged and still expect me to order another!! Clogged with what?) Had the NY Strip done medium with horseradish crust and subbed asparagus for fries. Meat was done as ordered but the horseradish crust had zero flavoring. Not worth the $2 up charge. Overall, steak really not worth 32 bucks!! Plate had 4 asparagus spears. Yes, 4!! Really? Presentation and waitstaff somewhat lacking. Will give another chance sometime and try some of the handhelds but will likely not order the main entrees. Value just wasn't there."}
{"text":"Loved the skillet cornbread and fresh cut fries! Signature cocktails are pricy but they are well made with fresh ingredients and top shelf liquor. The seating is comfortable and service is attentive witbout being obtrusive. The GM Mike was welcoming and performed several quality checks throughout the course of our visit. I ordered a \"pick two\" entree with one of my picks being what was described as smoked chicken and was surprised when it came out with barbecue sauce on top. It tasted like a piece of grilled chicken with BBQ sauce on it to me and wasn't what I expected. After all the cornbread and a delicious Caesar salad I didn't care!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the ambiance but I have to say I've been here twice for happy hour and the prickly pear margarita tastes like you're drinking straight sugar and I like sweet drinks but it's just not good."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with my husband and I was really looking forward to a good salad. I order the Rotisserie Roasted Chicken & Avocado Salad and he ordered a Burger with Potato Salad. The chicken had a very odd taste, croutons were soft and too sweet, and the dressing had so much sugar in it I couldn't even eat the salad.  We have had excellent food here up until today....very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place for barbeque.... Sweet and thick sauce..... Meats are done perfectly..... Juicy and not dry..... Potato salad was great..... If you go, make sure to get dessert too... Chocolate pecan pie rocks!.  Great service as well.... And great, comfortable atmosphere... Much better than Table 22 was....Will be going here again... And again."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but trumped by the terrible customer service we experienced.    I went with my boyfriend an friend last Tuesday (about a week ago).  We got there around 5:30 and were told it was a 15 minute wait and that we would be texted when our table was ready.  We waited in the only waiting area they had (since the bar was full) which is a little hall way with two chairs.  After waiting 40 total minutes we went to ask what the hold up was.  I was told by the young hostess that they had sent us two text 10 minutes earlier notifying us that our table was ready.  I never received anything and even showed her my phone.  She read back my phone number and she had the correct number.  All she did was say she moved us \"to the top of the list\".  I asked if there was anything I should do to ensure I would be notified. She just stared at me and said \"oh I don't know why you didn't get the message\".  Fast forward to anyother twenty minutes (it's now been 1 hour exactly) and we were finally seated, with no real apology from the hostess. We waited another ten minutes for the server to finally come over and take our drink order.  The server was great once she came by.    In the meanwhile, while we were waiting MULTIPLE people came in after us, without reservations, and were seated before us.  There was an older couple who came in well after us and were waiting for a bit as well.  What appeared to me the manager came over and asked how he could help them and they said they had been waiting for a table.  This man started bending over backwards to get them a table as soon as possible.  When he couldn't seat them  immediately he brought them a gift card for their time, then seated them before us.  They waited about half the time we did.  Not to mention the tables who were seated before us even though we were at the \"top of the list\".    The same man who bent over backwards for the older couple came half way through our dinner (after we explained to the server what we use went through), I assume she or the hostess must have told him.  When he approached our table all he said was \"Just want to make sure everything got settled her- I know there was a \"snafu\" with the texting earlier\" and walked away.  The only person who showed any remorse for this was the server-- although I can't remember her name.  She was great.  It just put a huge damper on the whole meal and ruined the evening for us.   We all got salads and soup.  The food was decent, which is why I am giving it two stars, but the Customer Service (other than the server) was really quite poor."}
{"text":"Just went to this place last night and I've been hearing wonderful things so I figured I would try it out. I'm so happy I did! Staff was amazing and super friendly and the food was great! Will definitely be going back ASAP! I had the seared ahi tuna salad and it was so good highly recommend the only thing negative I can say was the tuna was a tiny bit fatty but other than that it was awesome and the dressing is delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Baby Back ribs were fantastic as was the angus steak.  Great atmosphere!  Good choice for our anniversary dinner."}
{"text":"First experience here. The guacamole was awesome! I had the seafood enchilada and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Impromptu lunch after church.  Good service and good food.   Seafood Enchiladas were outstanding. Daughter had seafood tacos and enjoyed.  Wife had filet mignon which was perfect. Decor and ambience very nice."}
{"text":"My wife and I had the same thought this past weekend to grab a burger for lunch after working out.....and I recalled having a California Burger at Juniper a couple months past so I suggested that, even though we now have Burgatory and Five Guys Burgers in Murrysville, I like the upscale atmosphere and sophisticated ambiance of this place.   If they hadn't put the \"Brunch Special Menu\" in front of me I'd have ordered the California Burger - it's a home-run itself - a half pound over-sized burger big enough to split made with with Monterrey Jack Cheese, Thick Cut (ask for well) done bacon, fresh made Guacamole, Red Onion and some kind of special sauce BUT WAIT on the Specials Menu was this  Breakfast Burger that had about a dozen interesting ingredients that I can't even recall beyond greens, a sunny side egg, grilled veggies and it was open face on toast. It was absolutely one of the best burgers I've ever had. The manager told me the Chef in this Murrysville Juniper Grill had concocted this and minutes later we spoke to him as complimented him on the dish.   I have had numerous very good experiences with Juniper Grill employees and Annie on this visit was very, very good. Kudos to the staff and management."}
{"text":"The owner personally came to our table and shared his passion for fresh, local food. The food was excellent and the wine was even better. We live a distance away but this is was the perfect destination for a celiac wine lover."}
{"text":"Our meal consisted of: - Gumba soup over light right - Chicken Street Tacos - Harvest Salad - House Salad - Roasted Brussels Sprout w/ shallots, cherry tomatoes, and bell peppers And... - AWESOME SIGNATURE CORNBREAD AND FRESH BERRY SAUCE with ice cream  Every dish we had was amazing, filling,  delicious, and well prepared.  The most surprising dish was the cornbread for dessert!! It was AMAZING!! My mom, who tends to criticize and find fault with most restaurants, had NO complaints the entire time.  She enjoyed everything she had!! If you knew my mother, you would be just as surprised as I am! The ambiance was nice, and the customer service was great.  It truly earned its 5 star rating!!! I am definitely coming back...soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place, great service, great food!  My favorite crembule  I have ever had.   Love the cornbread desert.  The chipotle skirt steak is to die for."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here today on a whim for a late lunch, we've heard many good things about it and they were all so right!   First and foremost the place is exceptionally clean, second every single staff member we talked to was so incredibly nice. We sat in the dining room area in a booth that was super comfy!  Our waitress came over in five seconds to help us with our drinks and well as another waiter who explained the menu to us. He asked us if we were new to the restaurant and when we said yes, he explained each part of the menu.   I was surprised that every single item is freshly made in house and they don't freeze anything. I LOVE restaurants like this so immediately I was impressed. The man continued to explain what was the most popular, most flavorful, etc.   We ordered the guac and chips for an appetizer and they were great. Their chips are perfect and the salsa and quac were both delicious!  For our entrees my boyfriend ordered the fish tacos which he said were phenomenal and I had the beef brisket sandwich which was basically to die for. We also got corn bread as a side and it was basically heaven.   I would recommend Juniper Grille to anyone who wants a delicious meal for not too much money, and a good relaxing time!!  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"From out of town and found on yelp.  Deserves the positive ratings that it has gotten."}
{"text":"One of the best steak places in the Monroeville Murrysville area. Very good ambience and nice service. Timely food service and would totally recommend"}
{"text":"I look forward to coming back! I had the smoked brisket sandwich without the horseradish sauce and had coleslaw as my side. It was so moist and flavorful. My aunt is gluten free and there were so many options on the menu for her, which is why she suggested this place. Our server recommended all the stuff I was looking at so it made it that much harder to decide, so I'll have to go back."}
{"text":"My all time favorite restaurant! I cannot get enough of this place! Everything from food, staff to atmosphere is absolutely perfection! To begin- I have a gluten allergy. Those of you who have a food allergy know just how hard it is to eat out. Juniper Grill in Murrysville takes all of the hassle out of going out to eat with an allergy! Many of items on the menu can be modified to be or are gluten free! Almost all of the staff and the manager are extremely knowledgable on gluten free. Big deal for us gluten free people: THEY HAVE A SEPARATE FRYER FOR THE FRIES! Yes you heard me! Just make sure you tell your waiter as always!  The atmosphere is so relaxing. The staff are friendly, accommodating, and helpful!   My favorite meal: Campfire chicken burger with fries (minus the bun for gf), and the salsa trio with chips.   I cannot get enough of this place!"}
{"text":"Food was very good, so was the service. The prices were a tad high, but overall we were happy with our dining experience. We will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"Juniper grill is one of my go to restaurants, great food with a classy atmosphere. I ordered the New York strip, medium with green beans and mashed potatoes. The steak was cooked perfectly to my likings as was everything else I ordered.   I would have gave the 5 stars but the presentation of everything was terrible. Everything I ordered was plain looking . No garnish or special display just steak on a plate. Great food otherwise."}
{"text":"Love all of the food I have ever had there and the desserts.  Excellent service. Fun and relaxed car atmosphere.  Definitely get reservations for the weekend, large parties or holidays."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a late lunch on the recommendation of another. Our Party of 2 was immediately seated, as there was practically no one else in the place. Warm dark colors with comfortable seating. Our waitress was friendly and efficient. She offered some recommendations upon request and was spot on!   We ordered an appetizer of the brisket flatbread which was INCREDIBLE! So thin and crispy and full of flavor. I will do order this again.  For our entrees we ordered the crab and lobster enchiladas and shrimp tacos. Borge entrees were accompanied by a side of beans. One had black beans and rice and the other had black eye peas and corn. Both dishes were excellent and I would highly recommend.  This is a bit pricey for lunch. Our bill with two Non Alcoholic beverages totaled about $50 + tip. Same prices for dinner, so overall not too bad. We had leftovers to take home as it was a bit much for lunch fare to be fair."}
{"text":"\"Go to\" lunch stop for business meetings in the Murrysville area.  The food is top notch - and I mean top notch - plus the portions are more than filling and will stay with you for the rest of the day.    I can't say I deviate too much from the burgers or sandwiches or fish or shrimp tacos - but every time I visit this place I (and the group I'm with) end up talking about how good the food was...it's that kind of place.    I really should take my wife here for dinner...it's good eats - every time!"}
{"text":"We usually stop at Juniper Grill in Peters Township. Very glad we decided to go here today. I really enjoyed the rotisserie chicken tortilla soup as a starter but the special of the day was really spectacular. It was scallops over rice with a delicious lobster sauce and a very interesting coleslaw. My wife is enjoying the shrimp and crab enchiladas also."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with 7 family members and we were immediately taken on a tour by the owner of the restaurant. We were impressed with how nice it looked.   We ordered a bacon dip with flatbread for an appetizer. It was delicious. The others in the party ordered cocktails.   The main dishes were very good. Reasonably priced with fairly large portions. I ordered the California burger which was great. Check out the pictures of other drinks and dishes. We will be back for sure. It's great to have another good restaurant in Murrysville."}
{"text":"So to start I am not sure what the identity of this resturant is... Elegant, Southwestern, Mexican, Texas, Barbecue...  But with that being said the service was really good for being open only two weeks. No complications in our experience. The Pineapple Mojito was exceptional.  The cheese dip was on point and the entrees were excellent. No complaints here."}
{"text":"Loved the scallop special and pumpkin cornbread dessert served up with flair by Chris Little!"}
{"text":"Smoked brisket was excellent. Extensive menu for food and drinks. Jordan was a super friendly waiter and had great recommendations. Chile infused Margarita is a must try"}
{"text":"My husband and I wandered in here the other Friday night, and we had such a pleasant experience. Staff was gracious, informative and efficient. Atmosphere was upscale yet comfortable. Food was awesome! I had the seared tuna salad, and as one of my favorite entrees to order whenever restaurants offer it, I am quite picky and have high expectations. Tuna was fresh and tasty, and the salad was stocked with filling veggies and wonton crisps. Sometimes it's hard to feel satisfied after a salad - but not here. Our server clarified ingredients with us in case either of us had food allergies or intolerances. Very thoughtful! My husband said his tuna sandwich was one of the best in his life. We just moved here from Manhattan, and love to go out to eat and try new places. We've been looking for a high quality dinner spot in town (it's been hard to find), and this place is right at the top of our list!"}
{"text":"Staff is always welcoming and so knowledgable. I have never had a bad experience with the food, ever. You can't go wrong with the skirt steak, fish tacos or chicken avocado salad. Impressive wine selection for even the most picky vino palates. Chef is so creative with such delicious feature menu items. I splurged tonight on the Chambersburg Peaches, Grilled Peach Sundae for dessert. 100% worth every calorie !    Came back for brunch, 4/23/17, awesome decision. Got the Bloody Mary bar for my first Bloody Mary experience, the breakfast skillet and my husband got the brisket hash. Everything was so delicious and the staff were amazing as always. My husband and I don't get to go out too much but Juniper Grill is always on the top of our list!"}
{"text":"This place has always been a favorite coming through was really disappointed in the quality and service last time there. I think it may be starting to go downhill. I hope they can get back to what they are good at."}
{"text":"Went with friends for lunch. First time for me. The fish tacos were amazing! Large pieces of fish, not just a few small pieces like most places serve! Delightful sauce on taco! Ordered a side of guacamole and chips and it was excellent! I will definitely return!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, even better drinks. The raspberry Bellini martini is the best martini I've ever had. The service is superb. I've recommended Juniper to many many persons. Keep up the great job."}
{"text":"We have dined at Juniper Grill no less than 20 times. We sit at the bar, have some drinks, enjoy some food-consistently good-in fact we took a large party for lunch at Juniper Grill just 2 weeks ago, prior to our daughters graduation on June 2nd from Woodland Hills. We've had nice conversation with Mike, one of the owners. It's become one of our top choices for a great casual meal. Tonight was a different story. We were waited on, at the bar, by Katie. Katie needs to understand what the word \"hospitality\" means. From the very beginning of our meal, Katie was curt and dismissive. We were talking with her about why the restaurant doesn't serve bread with a meal. When I asked for some bread to go with my plain grilled salmon, grilled asparagus and mashed Yukon gold potatoes-which by the way were tasty but not hot. Katie went on to justify the lack of bread service with \"well that's just not our concept,\" in a really dismissive tone that I found personally totally offensive. She didn't really listen-she just needed to be RIGHT. I let Karie know that she clearly crossed the line and I said \"we're good, thanks.\" Katie ran from behind the bar. We observed her talking to about us, first to kitchen staff, and then to other customers who were at the other end of the bar. It was obvious and incredibly rude and made us feel very uncomfortable  and frankly completely offended. It was so unbelievably unprofessional. Needless to say we will NEVER be back. The thing about REALLY rude service is, that not only will we NEVER BE BACK, but we will certainly tell our friends about our experience at Juniper Grill and advise them NOT to go there for any meal or for any reason. To have a bartender gossip about us to other customers, right in front of us,  is completely and utterly unacceptable. Katie needs to be relieved of her position before she does any more damage to this business. She got a 10% tip and didn't deserve that. Stay away from this place. Nobody deserves to be treated this way. Stay away from this place. Who knows what else goes on here!!!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and the classy décor. It was a packed house tonight and there were several large groups filling up the dining space.  We were fortunate to be  seated in an area away from the hustle and bustle of the room but the noise still carried back toward us.  They did a nice job with maximizing the amount of diners they are able to accommodate but it is a bit challenging maneuvering through the dining room without invading others privacy and dining space.  Their menu features a nice array of dishes.  Most of their specialties are grilled beef, poultry and fish.  The portions are usual in size but a little pricey as far as receiving anything extra on the side.  For instance, the salmon was cooked to perfection but it had a few stalks of asparagus on the side for 19.00 and both appeared lost on the huge dinner plate.  They have an extensive wine and specialty drink menu worth noting. Our hostess and server provided professional and attentive service and I look forward to visiting here again to try their selection of sandwiches, seafood tacos, and salads."}
{"text":"I ate here last night for the fist time and the atmosphere of the restaurant was pleasant and inviting. The service was excellent, and the presentation of the food was good. The food was enjoyable and is perfect for a good date night out. I will definitely be a returning customer."}
{"text":"Since juniper grill had so many good reviews, I took colleagues visiting from Germany. I ordered the seafood enchiladas. They wasn't much of a description in the menu.  Enchiladas were covered with a very salty cheese sauce. It tasted like a flour tortilla which was really soggy. Enchiladas are usually made with corn tortilla.  I thought they were horrible.  I would have given a lower rating but two people in our party ordered hamburgers and two people ordered the broasted chicken which they said they liked."}
{"text":"We've been to Juniper Grill twice, and had somewhat different experiences both times.  The first time we were with a group of 8 adults and 5 kids celebrating my husband and his twin sisters 30th birthdays.  When we arrived we were treated like VIP's, multiple people holding doors for us, greeting us with big welcoming smiles, showing us to our table and engaging in really casual, appropriate conversation.  We were in a private, back room which was REALLY nice and cozy.  Our server was totally on point!  She was super friendly, really efficient, and she was really personable, even with the 5 kids (you could tell she was a mom.. she knew all the right things to say and do, and treated them like little people and not like little nuisances).  She made great suggestions and she was totally into our group, which made our experience really memorable, thank you for that!  My husband and I went back a few weeks later by ourselves for dinner on a Saturday evening, and when we got there, we stood at the host stand for about 3 minutes before we were acknowledged by the host who was standing there the entire time.  She was very consumed with whatever she was doing or figuring out, and it wasn't until someone else (maybe a manager) came to the host stand and asked her if she had greeted us.. because she obviously hadnt.. that she acted totally surprised to see us and finally noticed us.  Because this was totally different than what we experienced last time, we tried not to hold it against her too much, but we were still annoyed and we hadn't even been seated yet.  She asked us if we'd prefer a small table in the bar area or to sit at the \"Chef's Bar\", I think it was called (or something like that).. she explained to us that that particular area was really fun and that people loved sitting there because of the interaction and liveliness of it, so we agreed and decided to give it a try.  We were really confused because no one actually seemed to be our server, even though she gave us the name of someone, and people were just rushing by us busy doing their thing - grabbing food, refilling drinks, etc.. we felt kind of invisible and it was a little awkward.  So we were finally greeted by someone who did inform us that he was not our server but would get our drinks, so we ordered and waited some more.  Eventually we did finally make contact with someone who claimed to be our server, but I think it may just be rotation based and I got the feeling that this particular seating arrangement was sort of an annoyance to whoever was up in the rotation.  Turns out it wasn't fun or exciting..  no one engaged in any conversation with us and our POV was cooks, a food expediter, and the hustle and bustle of what other restaurants would hide behind walls in a closed kitchen.. we could see right into the dishwashing area,  the dining area and rest of the restaurant was to our backs, and we were the only 2 sitting at this bar area.. it was a little uncomfortable.  I was really unimpressed with this set up and regretting not choosing the small bar table.  The only redeeming quality was that our server from last time happened to be doing some of her side work while we were sitting there and so we struck up conversation with her for a couple of minutes, but that was really it.    I didn't base my star rating on that experience, because I honestly believe that Juniper Grill is a great place and our first visit was nothing like our second.. it was just an unfortunate chain of events for us.  Lesson learned, always choose the \"small table in the bar area!\" :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to go somewhere for dinner that we had never been to and hopped on 22 and ended up here. We arrived shortly after 5pm and, being a Monday, it wasn't really crowded. A few tables full, but most people were sitting at the bar. We were promptly seated at a booth in the bar by the host, who gave us our menus and also came back to get our drink order. Both times he mentioned that he would not be our waiter, and that our waiter would be over soon to tel us the dinner specials.   We had plenty of time to look over the menu before our waiter came over. When he finally arrived (he had walked past our table twice without acknowledging us), we were pretty sure we knew what we wanted, but asked for the dinner specials anyway. He said he wasn't sure and would have to go in the back and find out. Never mind, we said, and ordered. I ordered a chicken sandwich and my husband got enchiladas. Then, our waiter went on to tell us how big and delicious their burgers are (8oz if you're wondering) and that they are bigger than Atria's 7oz (which is also owned by Juniper Grill, he said),  Burgatory's 6oz burger and Five Guys 5oz burger. Great, but we didn't order burgers, so...  Anyway, our food arrived quickly, brought by a different server. I had the Campfire Chicken Sandwich with fries for $10.50. It came with: grilled chicken breast, cheddar cheese, jalapeno mayo, lettuce, bacon, caramelized onions & bbq sauce. I asked for no lettuce, because I usually take it off sandwiches anyway. Somehow, tomatoes ended up on my sandwich, but that was fine because I like them. The sandwich was good, but kind of messy and soggy, between the slices of tomato, mayo, and bbq. It could have done without one of the sauces or at least one on the side. The fries came in a separate basket, so my husband was able to easily steal about half of them. The H ordered the smoked pork enchiladas with drunken black beans and rice. I'm not sure what makes them drunk, as they is no explanation on the menu that I saw. I imagined black beans doing tequila shots on the prep table, but could not confirm this. The H enjoyed his meal. I taste-tested both the enchiladas (good) and the black beans and rice (okay, kind of plain).   Pros: The place is spectacularly clean, bathrooms included. Host was friendly, as was the waiter. I like the separate bar and dining area and the place was comfortable and inviting. There is also a small outside seating area. I also like that the menu is small - one page - and not confusing or too busy. Food was good but not great.  Cons: As I said, food was good but not great. Not $30 great, for sure. Also, like a previous reviewer stated, I'm not quite sure what the theme is to this restaurant. Apparently, according to the waiter, they specialize in brisket, but they serve a lot of Mexican-style items and burgers. Also, I don't really care for one person to bring my drinks, another to take my order, another to bring my food. It's confusing - who are you tipping?   Overall, not the best experience but I would certainly give it another try if in the area. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Our waitress Leah, couldn't have been more accommodating. She was well versed on all dishes and cocktails. The ambience was first-class with just the right amount of light. Tables, chairs and booths were high end with stacked stone on walls and modern, clean design. Food was very good. Hubby had the brisket plate with Yukon gold mashed potatoes and a home made BBQ sauce. I had one of the featured specials of the night, marinated chicken skewers with rice pilaf and fresh corn on the cob. My pineapple infused cosmopolitan was awesome with just the right amount of tart sweetness. If you're from the area or just traveling through, stop in for a salad, burger or filet, you won't be disappointed! Ask for Leah."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Juniper Grill, but the first to the Murrysville location.  I went with my mom and it was just about 5 PM on a Friday, so we clearly beat the rush.  We were immediately seated at a booth at the bar, and by the time we left, there was a few people waiting to be seated.    Very quick and thorough service.  Our waiter, Dave, was friendly and attentive.  He's clearly a professional and knows what he is doing.  We ordered the tortilla chips and salsa and guacamole for our appetizer.  Nothing special, but a good pre-dinner snack.  My main course was the mahi-mahi burger with a side of their potato salad.  My fish was cooked well but I will say that if I hadn't had the side of \"boom boom\" or \"bam bam\" sauce it would have been a pretty bland dish.  The potato salad was just ok.  It wasn't bad, just not great.  My mom had the fish tacos which you are given two of.  She said it was ok, but nothing spectacular.  For dessert we shared the corn muffin with strawberry sauce and ice cream.  It was different.  Not a knock-you-out-of-this-world dessert, but it was good.  I wasn't blow away during my visit here.  I didn't order a cocktail but I did look and the prices seem kind of high.  I'll try it again here and hopefully will have something a little more exciting."}
{"text":"I have to say I picked this place randomly, we are from out of town and we hit the jack pot!! My party of 4 was pleasantly surprised!! Service was great,  Chris (guy) our waiter,  was very helpful and attentive !! Food was even better!!! Some in my party had Amish chicken with Yukon mashed potatoes and veggies, also tried chicken sandwich and beef burger , side order of drunken black beans,appetizers , all of which were cooked just perfect and were very tasty. Very clean , staff very pleasant, great food for the value!!! If I am ever back in the area I would make sure to stop by."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service! Hope they open some up in MA or RI. The fish tacos and guacamole were incredible!"}
{"text":"The Juniper grill had fabulous pricing and great food. I expected the bill to be significantly higher. I was shocked at the price. The ahi tuna salad may have been the best salad I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"We ate dinner here Saturday night before driving into the city for a show. We had a 6:00 reservation but got there at 5:30. No problem, they seated us immediately, as they already had the table set up.  There were 6 of us and 4 of us were doing Weight Watchers. No problem there either. We were able to choose the salmon or the tuna offerings and still stay on track. The salmon was grilled and came with grilled vegetables and grilled asparagus and was perfectly done. The Ahi Tuna was on a bed of Spring Greens and was also wonderful. Side salads and soup of the day were also enjoyed.Of course the menu had lots of other delicious sounding dishes. One of group got the brisket and mashed potatoes and was very pleased. The other non-dieter got the crab enchiladas and loved them. Someone ordered the Key Lime dessert and passed it around to share. Again, not disappointed, and worth the calories.  The wine list was good and the assortment of top shelf tequilas offered was impressive. One friend got the Prickly Pear Margarita and said it was as tasty as it was beautiful to look at.  The atmosphere was modern but welcoming. Tables were filled with families with young children as well as date night couples. Ladies room was clean as was the entire facility. For as busy as they were, noise level wasn't bad. I could hear the person at the opposite end of our 6 person table. And the service was spot on. Nice staff from the hostess to the waitress and all others who delivered our food or drinks. All in all, I will be returning when I'm not dieting to enjoy some of those other tasty sounding entrees and some of that good tequila."}
{"text":"First visit here and, upon entering, my husband and I were excited to experience this restaurant.  The interior was inviting and the aroma gave us hope.  Even the menu offerings had our appetite going in several directions and we elicited help from our server who was very likeable in his role.   We then received our meals very quickly.  That is when our good experience ended.  I ordered brisket and baby back ribs with asparagus,  while my husband ordered the baby back ribs with macaroni and cheese. Both of us agreed.  The ribs seemed overcooked and did not fall off the bone.  The brisket was not nearly tender enough.  The flavors clearly did not match either the smells permeating the venue or the expectations given their claims of everything being smoked in-house.  And the Mac n cheese? It looked like and my husband said it tasted like Velveeta cheese.  The asparagus? Slightly tough and woody.    How oh how could this place have a 4 star Yelp rating and be packed with diners tonight?? Beats me.   High hopes turned into a disappointment.  As I continue to say there are way too many options of dining establishments in the area to return for another try."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  Loving food once again - we had fish taco's, skirt steak and brisket.  The meat was perfection, melt in your mouth... Got to try!!!"}
{"text":"We went the night before Valentine's day with a reservation for 8:15. We ended up having to wait an  additional 15 minutes due to the busy crowd.  Once we were seated, the manager came over to our table.  He told us to order two appetizers on the house, since we had to wait! The appetizers and entrees did not disappoint.  Some of the entrees ordered at our table were the seafood enchiladas,  ribs, and filet.   My dad ordered the pecan pie dessert and he said it was one of the best desserts he ever had . It came out hot with ice cream on top.  We were highly impressed with the Juniper grille.  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Fancy and unique. Pricy for what it is. I've had way better but still a new place to check out. I picked this to be my Father's Day lunch with a group."}
{"text":"There is everything to love here.  Food, atmosphere, staff, parking... they have it all and its all well executed.  We snagged one of their two outside tables and were somewhat apprehensive about level of service, as it was a busy Friday night.  No issue, our server was pleasant and unrushed.  We were visited by the manager and treated to a higher level of service than ever expected.    We all started with a cup of soup and then shared the street tacos.  Then came Brisket Quesadilla, huge and declared as tasty as it was lovely.  Pulled Pork Sandwich was a mile high.  Salmon is always a favorite, add a little jalapeno honey sauce and a side of black beans and dirty rice and I'm a happy girl.  Hubs had the Meat Trio and fries... A+  This wasn't our first trip to the JG, won't be our last.   Here's an item worth mentioning from our last visit:  Smoked Bourbon. Although this visit we remained alcohol free, last visit the Smoked Bourbon and Spiced Sangria were terrific start points!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Hummus appetizer was fantastic. Server brought many extra warm pitas to make sure we finished it all. Ahi tuna salad for dinner which was also very good. It's a lovely restaurant, and the staff seems genuinely kind and eager to help. I'd go again."}
{"text":"1/21/2017. Wife's birthday. Had reservations 2 weeks in advance. Upon arrival, the booth I asked for was not available and the manager tried to convince us that a 2-top in the bar was actually in the dining room. Spoiled a Birthday dinner.  The manager made no attempt to help us out. We were basically out of luck. No \"I can find you something in a few minutes, would you like a drink at the bar\". Arrogant attitude completely unlike what I've experienced in our many previous visits to this location.  I did something I've never done before at a restaurant... lost my temper.   Juniper Grill and (co-owned) Atria's were two of our favorite places. Tonight changed my thinking about this place."}
{"text":"The Juniper Grille restaurant located in Murrysville is a fantastic eating experience. For special occasions, my wife and I like to explore new dining options, and this establishment did not disappoint.  We were promptly seated in a cozy booth. The service from our waiter, Chris, was prompt, professional, and very courteous. We ordered the Salsa Trio appetizer which consisted of nachos with cheese, salsa, and guacamole. The chips tasted homemade and were not too salty. The dips were plentiful.  For the main course, my wife had the Spit Fired Amish Chicken which came with a small piece of cornbread. She substituted baked beans for the mashed potatoes. The chicken had an excellent taste and wasn't dried out. The portion size was also more than ample as there were leftovers to bring home.  I ordered the Premium Gold Angus Strip steak with mashed potatoes. I also added a side of green beans. The steak was well-marinated and cooked perfectly. The potatoes were Yukon Gold with a buttery taste, and the green beans tasted steamed to perfection.  Overall, the experience was wonderful. The environment had a perfect ambiance and wasn't too loud. The only negative that I would mention is the lack of a bread service. For a fine establishment like this to not offer a bread course is a minor point against it. We will definitely return to Juniper Grille again."}
{"text":"The bison burger was amazing. Fries were phenomenal.  Chicken was tender an melted in mouth.  We also had the tacos an the salsa trio for apps.   Perfect place to stop before heading to Pens game."}
{"text":"Pricey. I had baby back ribs cooked pretty well. Didn't really knock my socks off or I would have gave it more stars."}
{"text":"I came here with my wife for a Sunday lunch.  The place is clean and the decor presents a nice upscale atmosphere.    I had seafood enchiladas which were fantastic.  I would order them again and encourage anyone who likes seafood and/or enchiladas to seriously consider ordering them.  My wife had the California burger and fries which was also good.    We will try this place again.  They have a mahi mahi sandwich which sounds good or fish tacos which I would also give a go."}
{"text":"What a great neighborhood eatery! Juniper Grill does a lot of things the right way. Service was great with both our greeter and waiter. I had the evening special - orange roughy with lobster sauce, wood grilled asparagus and quinoa. Every element of the fish was well balanced, tender and perfectly seasoned. My husband ordered the short rib tacos and roasted vegetables. There was a healthy ratio of short ribs and he enjoyed the dish right down to a clean plate. I helped with the roasted vegetables - such a great balance of smokiness and a perfect al dente texture. My stepson had the three combo platter - pulled pork, brisket and sausage. None of that was wasted! The barbecue sauce was perfect - lots of flavor without too much sugar. No complaints all around!  Of course, since the food was all so rewarding we had to go for the dessert, and went with the seasonal apple cobbler. Served in a cast iron square, it had a nice crunchy crust with an apple-forward flavor. The spices were subtle to let the apple flavor shine. I loved the fact that there was nothing artificial in the flavor profile, and nothing was overly sweet, right down to the ice cream topper. In a world where there is so much sugar or salt used to compensate for inferior ingredients, Juniper Grill doesn't use props and the ingredients shine on their own merit. That takes skill from a good chef. Well done!"}
{"text":"Gave this location a try last night for dinner with my wife as we had never tried Juniper Grill before.   We found this to be the definition of pricing based on location and interior decor, completely divorced from food value.   The $21+ beef short rib dinner lived up to the name \"short\" as in short on substance, short on value!  The dinner as served consisted of a 3\" x 3\" cube of short rib meat, an ice cream scoop of very average mashed potatoes and wait for it....7 pcs. - yes I counted, 7 pcs of carrot each less than an inch long and cut in half lengthwise.   On top of the extremely poor value food, our waitress was obnoxiously fake when she decided to come around, which wasn't very often.   $21 for what amounted to $5 max cost in food, no salad or bread and an obnoxious waitress all add up to \"WILL NOT RETURN\""}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant on this side of town, so glad they came to Murrysville.  We've made multiple trips now and the food is outstanding!  The beef short rib is phenomenal, and the fish tacos are the best I have ever had, nationwide.  This place is tops.  Everything is great.  Definitely worth a special trip.  They just do things right."}
{"text":"We weren't expecting the room to be upscale and cozy, or the variety and the quality of the food here - but the menu was impressive and the food and drink were delicious!  Special attention to the little details took this to a full five stars for me - yes, you should chill the salad plates, but my salad came with a chilled fork as well. EVERYTHING was thoughtfully crafted and prepared.  The cocktail menu made me wish I could spend more time there exploring.  The menu was a great assortment of southwestern and smokehouse classics.  The baby back ribs were meaty and fall off the bone tender, with a great smoked-on sauce, and the cornbread was moist and hearty. I can't wait to come back and try desserts!"}
{"text":"My husband and I met up with a co-worker here for drinks and dinner on a Saturday afternoon / night. The ambience is great, staff was friendly and prompt and the food was very, very good. We were also surprised at the pricing. Our final bill for the 3 of us was cheaper than what my husband and I are  accustomed to paying for just the 2 of us in Philadelphia. Definitively stop in and try it out!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried the Juniper Grill today. Very clean, very very comfortable seats in the booth. Interesting decor. Ok now on to the real reason I'm here. As I write this review, I'm salivating. I'm still STUFFED from the delicious food, but thinking OF that delicious food, and trying to describe it, has me drooling on my keyboard. I'm a carnivore. I'm not an indiscriminate carnivore, but if it's meat, I want it. For appetiser I had something like Spicy Shrimp flatbread (not exactly sure of the name, my brain is still muttering exclamations to itself over how good the food was). My wife tried the Brisket Queso Dip. Both were excellent. My wife suggested trying the dip on the flatbreat and it was, believe it or not, even better! For the main course, I had a salad... YEAH, RIGHT! CARNIVORE, remember? I had to try the Smokehouse Platter *as suggested by our very good server, Jordan. I selected ribs, brisket, and smoked chicken. The ribs were AWESOME! I spent quite a while in the military, and Ive eaten ribs in most but not all of the states in USA. These ribs are in my top 10. Juicy, fall-off-the-bone goodness. Dang it! Let me get a towel for my keyboard. Ok, now on to the brisket. Brisket is very easy to make, but very hard to make well. These guys did it right! Dang it, let me get a LARGER towel for my keyboard. The hand towel gave up. Ok, Brisket. Brisket.. BRISKET!! Awesome McAwesome Dish. The chicken breast was great as well. Jordan also suggested the corn bread. As stated before, I've eaten around the US. I KNOW cornbread. Juniper's cornbread was in the top 3 of the best I've ever tasted. Ok, moving on to dessert. I was stuffed. I had enough food for another meal due to the generous size of the appetizer and mains. Jordan mentioned Sarris ice cream. Ive tried the Sarris chocolate, and it's excellent. Despite the fact that my wife said she was full, I ordered two scoops of the ice cream, knowing if it was good, she'd want to try. The ice cream was sweet vanilla goodness, covered with a chocolate shell. Yes, despite both of us being a bit more than full, we finished off the ice cream. NOTE: Rumors that my wife growled at me when I reached between her and the ice cream may or may not be true. Ok fine, she didn't growl, out loud. So, final summation: The food may be considered a little pricy by some, but I'd say that, without a doubt, it's well worth the cost. Great food, great service, great experience. We're going back. And Im drooling again...."}
