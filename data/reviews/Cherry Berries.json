{"text":"Four stars because today i went for lunch to get two Carne Asada Panini only to find out that they didnt have enough meat. So I ended up getting one Carne Asad and one Pastrami. The Pastrami Panini was not that much flavorful as the Carne Asada one, I'm not very happy with it but I'm very hungry so I am going to eat! But will I ever order another Pastrami? Never does not match the standard the other panini have set."}
{"text":"this place is amazing...very clean, friendly, prompt, excellent service and superior food!!!  i highly recommend it..."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place!!! There is nothing like it in Vegas.  Their panini sandwiches are so fresh and are huge.  A great deal for the price. They have a variety to choose from, you can't go wrong with any option but I always order  a side of jalapenos. Their smoothies and salads are excellent as well. I can never pass up one of their strawberry oatmeal smoothies; a perfect option for breakfast."}
{"text":"Love cherry berries!! I'm a frequent customer the food is always great! Subway has nothing
 on Cherry Berries. The panini are delicious"}
{"text":"A favorite neighborhood spot- simple menu with lots of fresh fruit and vegetables. Their bread is delicious & they are fast!"}
{"text":"I was surprised when the lady at the counter suggested jalapeños in a chicken pesto panini, but it was amazing. The place was cute with bright happy colors. The mango blueberry shake was delicious and they even honored the free ice cream with shake panini combo even though they said it was an old promotion."}
{"text":"Good place to go if you're craving something fast or just wanna stop buy for ice cream. Nice workers"}
{"text":"I love their Carne Asada Pepperoni Panini & boba smoothies. My fiancé is the one who would usually come here this last time we decided to go together and let me just say that they have poor customer service! The lady who was taking our order was rude and had an attitude! I decided to try one of their natural mango, kiwi, and carrot juices because it sounds good right? ehh wrong it tasted like plain carrot juice no hint of kiwi or mango. Even the lady sitting next to me said the same thing not only that they actually forgot to make her salad. Very poor customer service I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Place was hard to find, but the food was really good. I got the pepperoni-carne asada panini and was quite pleased."}
{"text":"Nice selection of smoothies and juices. The sandwiches are also really wonderful. We had the chicken pesto and the carne asada sandwiches. I will definitely be coming back. Yes, it is in a weird place, but I like the fact it is unassumingly tucked in a tiny seven eleven parking lot. It builds character."}
{"text":"Frankly, I was surprised to find healthy food in the 'hood. Fresh juices and salads, smoothies and omelets, and large, veggie-packed paninis! Prices are reasonable, store is clean, and service is friendly. However, service also speaks limited English, so you may need to use hand gestures to order. 

Minus one star because the parking lot is dangerous: not because it's a sketchy area (it's fine), but the spaces are tiny and the lot has narrow entrance/exits, without signs. Almost got into an accident both getting into and getting out of the lot, which is a deterrent to coming again."}
{"text":"After stopping by at this place and ordering our food and getting helped by the owner Marlén.
 it was a normal busy day,
We got our food ok, but after we started eating, 4 new customers came in and got their complete orders, to this point we didn't get our drinks, We couldn't believe what was happening, finally when everybody left she got our drinks.
I had to point that out and ask her if I could get a 10% off on our next visit for getting poor service.
To which she replied: \"No, there's always an unhappy customer\"
We couldn't believe the attitude!
If I could give 0 stars I would..."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced and the Paninis are great. Recommended lunch spot! Recommend their buffalo chicken and chicken bacon ranch."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb.com ! Always my go to when I'm running errands on this side of town. Lots of healthy choices and a decent size salad with FRESH grilled chicken to perfection."}
{"text":"So yummy in my tummy! I recommend the chicken pesto sandwich & their smoothies are good too."}
{"text":"I was looking for a sandwich spot after work, I happen to find this one near by. I stopped by and got a Carne Assad panini and a draw berry smoothie, weird combo but it was my choice. The panini was great and smoothie as well. I would recommend to anybody food is great and service as well."}
{"text":"I totally enjoyed this place. Not the best area,but as always, looks can be deceiving. Ordered a snow cone, smoothie, and a fresh juice. My juice was on point. Pineapple, oranges, and strawberries. Delicious. Only snafu was when the guy at the counter forgot I had ordered it. So I waited, and waited, and waited. When I mentioned it he totally owned up, apologized profusely and even offered a freebie scoop of ice cream for his mistake. I love it when people take responsibility for their errors and move on. This kid blew me away. I also loved this fresh juice and will definitely be returning when in the area. Always glad to support small businesses."}
{"text":"I decided to give Cherry's Berries a try because it's in close proximity to my gym. The inside is surprisingly clean and I question whether it's from lack of customers or because an employee is going around frequently sweeping the floors and wiping down the tables. 

I ordered the mango banana oatmeal sweetened with honey. While I was sitting down waiting for my smoothie to be made, the male employee asked me if he should use juice or milk and I told him whatever the recipe calls for. He pulls out a book to see how to make the smoothie.

When I tasted the smoothie, the ratios were off. There was too much ice which made every ingredient taste watered down and gave the smoothie a slush like consistency. I could hardly make out the banana or mango and even though the menu says sweetened with honey it tasted artificially sweetened. 

The lack of fresh fruits and low quality ingredients make the smoothies taste icy  and artificial."}
{"text":"I accidentally found this little hidden jewel! I have passed by here a MILLION times and never once noticed it. I was craving for and on the hunt for a chamango. This place has chamangos and MORE. 

Its super clean and the staff is very friendly and helpful. I only ordered a chamango but the food there looked oh-so yummy. They have a variety of food including carne asada fries, soup, and paninis. 

My chamango was made perfectly! There's nothing more than I can say...except I will be going her ALL the time. So happy I found this spot!!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Food, the service was a little bit slow which i was strange because we were the only customers there, I would say i wish they had put more pesto in my panini but next time ill just ask, very good icecream as well!"}
{"text":"This is a awesome place offering paninis , fresh squeezed juices,smoothies,fruit plates and ice cream. The prices are great. The ladies that work here are fast and very courteous and take pride in there food. I like the bacon ranch panini."}
{"text":"Bomb. bomb.
Work next door &  i eat there everyday!!"}
{"text":"There are so many things on this menu and if you are Mexican/Latin, you will want everything! It's overwhelming.

Smoothies: \"All Berries\"  delicious and so is the \"Strawberry Bannana.\"  The taste is natural and healthy.The Mango Banana is also delicious! Honestly don't think you can go wrong with any of their smoothies. 

Chicken Buffalo Panini....so toasty and cheesy! This is by far my favorite! All of their sandwiches are amazing but this one is particular is a MUST. It's got a little kick of spice, the chicken is nice and tender and the balsamic not too strong-PERFECFT! I came here with coworkers about a year ago and they all were beyond satisfied with their food and this second time of me coming, nothing has changed. 

I'm totally in for finding new places to eat that are family owned and operated. This place is not the most appealing from the outside but it's an amazing pick! The owners are very friendly and willing to help you answer any questions. LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. If ever driving down or near Sahara and Eastern, give this place a shot, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Love this place.  My coworker and I come here once a week for lunch.  We order ahead because it does take some time for the staff to make our food, but it is still soo worth it!!!  I also come here with my husband often.  I have been going here pretty much since they opened.  I love the chicken pesto panini, and the vegetarian panini.  Their juices are great."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this cute little cafe by my coworker who would always order this amazing Greek salad from them. I finally stopped by and ordered their panini sandwich I believe in which it was the chicken bacon ranch. It is so fantastic looking and definitely yummy for about $7 for the full sandwich. Not bad, but I do think for it's size a nice can of soda could go well with it as a combo.

They always have their lunch specials displayed and their employees are always super nice. I've been wanting to try their raspados however they are kind of costly for a drink I would get in L.A. for about a $1.00 

Great for a quick lunch or quick lunch date. Community is kind of ghetto and plaza is located in a super small and confusing parking lot. 
They have panini's salads and great smoothies. Try the strawberry banana kiwi smoothie you will thank me later."}
{"text":"***NEW FAVORITE SANDWICH ALERT***

Order the number 11 (Whole not Half, Half is just a tease and you will be hangry with yourself for not just ordering the whole)

Turkey on what can only be described and toasted Panini style bread filled with nuts and grains. Pilled high with Turkey, Lettuce, Spinach, Tomatos, Red Onion, and a special Dill-Mayo spread. Pure deliciousness.

And as if that wasn't enough, they have Popping Boba. *Insert Heart Eyes Emoji*

They have like 10-15 different smoothie flavors and they are nice and fresh plus they have fresh squeezed juices!

My new go to Sandwich spot at work!"}
{"text":"Cherry Berries is a cute little cafe!  I grew up on this side of town and remember that nothing cute or new ever moved in except for taco shop after taco shop.  Now I love a good taco, but I don't want tacos every day.  A girl needs some variety in her food options!  I am happy this side of town is finally getting some new business love!

I actually noticed the sign for Cherry Berries as I was driving past to run some errands with my mom, who still lives over here.  I hadn't heard about it, but I am always on the look out for new places.  I stopped on my way back to pop inside and check it out.  We had eaten earlier, so we were more interested in desserts this time around.  I did check out the food menu while waiting for our order though, and a lot of things looked like they would be tasty for a lunch meal.

We both got smoothies this time.  My mom had the piña colada and I had the orange vanilla one.  The piña colada tasted like the ones you get in Mazatlan while you are sitting on the beach relaxing.  It was very refreshing and tropical.  The orange vanilla one tasted exactly like it's name.  I really liked the huge amount of oranges that went into the smoothie though.  My kid is not into eating but will never turn down a ice cream.  I ordered this one because I knew it would be close to ice cream and I could get her to drink some.  It definitely worked because she drank more than half before I got it back.  So yeah for sneaking some fruit into her diet!  Sneaky, but it works!

They also have a decent selection of Dryer's ice cream for sale for when you aren't trying to trick your kid into eating something healthy.  The servings are big and the prices are low.  Yummy and a good deal!

The staff was friendly too, which is always nice.  The service is slow though.  I only ordered 2 smoothies but it took 10 minutes to get them and I was the only one in there.  They tasted great and you could tell they were made after I ordered them, but keep it in mind if you are in a rush.  

I would definitely come back to try out their food for lunch, if I was in the area.  I know if  I lived closer to this place, I would be here pretty regularly.  Go check it out if you are near Sahara/Eastern."}
{"text":"I love that this place is pretty cheap, has great food with fresh ingredients and amazing smoothies and juices.  Looking for a quick bite I highly suggest you check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem.... I love love love Cherry Berries!
My Favorites (in no particular order):
Fresh Juice- #7
Panini Style Sandwich- Carne Asada Pepperoni
RaspaHelado- Nuez & Pecan Praline Ice Cream with Mango Popping Bobba"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with this place! The Buffalo chicken panini is amazing!! And a must try!"}
{"text":"While Cherry Berries makes great desserts and smoothies, I'm on the lookout for new lunch options. Yesterday was a madhouse for me and I needed a quick lunch so I decided to give their Paninis a try. Parking in front was not even possible, the traffic to the 7-11 had cars 3 deep backed out onto Eastern trying to get in. I ended up parking around back, having to pass by the stinky trash cans and a homeless man to go in. 

I ended up ordering a Chicken Pesto panini: Chicken breast, muenster cheese, pesto sauce, mayo, tomato, balsamic onion, and lettuce. I also bought the meal deal with chips but upgraded to an \"All Berry\" smoothie for the drink, it came out to about $10. 

The smoothie came out first, but the panini seemed to take forever. I did have a hectic day yesterday so my sense of space and time may have been distorted but I started getting antsy that I was going to run out of time for lunch. When I got the panini it wasn't pretty like Panera Bread does theirs, but appearance is secondary, taste is everything. And the panini tasted... well it wasn't bad, but with pesto sauce and balsamic onions in it I just expected a little more zip, something to wake my mouth up a bit. This panini didn't have that. It was just good, but not great. 

So will I go back? For smoothies, absolutely. For paninis? I'll add it to my list as an option but my first impression was ho-hum. But they do have an extensive list of paninis and the staff always provides service with a smile so I'll give them another try."}
{"text":"I love this place! I always order the vegetarian panini with grilled chicken. It is legit healthy. No mayo or cheese, just hummus and real fresh veggies including spinach. Love."}
{"text":"Kind of surprised by amount of good reviews. We were on that side of town and wanted to get something sweet. Happen to see this place in a sketchy corner, but my boyfriend suggested we just go in and try it. It was very small inside, I believe there were 2-3 small tables with foldable chairs, and the menu was creative looking but \"different\"...they had random food choices from greek salads, elote's, to being a juice bar...We just weren't too positive on how this place was creating all of this fresh food and drinks with one adult worker and 2 kids walking back and forth behind counter and partially helping the adult with the orders. The adult also spoke limited English, so we ended up just getting a banana split, handed it to us in a meal size styrofoam container, nothing like the picture we saw on their site, it was a good regular banana split, of course because its ice cream.. but definitely not worth $7...Sonic makes bigger and better for cheaper. The people before us ordered a drink that had scooped in fruit with juice, a salad, which looked like a flat, quick, put-together salad with pieces of chicken and some veggies... anyway, that was our experience, nothing worth us raving about to anyone and may not go back. Maybe there isn't too many places to choose from around that area. I gave it 2 stars because it states a \"meh. I've experienced better\"."}
{"text":"The positive was finding a very clean, very friendly place in this area of town, with somewhat healthier offerings. I say somewhat, because the smoothies tasted sugared up, and I prefer simple fruit in my smoothie, not a Slurpee. Also had a veggie panini and it was good. Another negative (besides the sugar in the smoothies) was that the chip options were totally 80's junk. No baked chips or healthy option or trendy brand, like \"Food Should Taste Good\", or even just Sun Chips. I passed on having any Lay's or Cheetos, even though they came with the meal. My mom really liked the panini, though. The juices were good, and didn't taste like anything was added. Loved the sweet gal at the counter; nice people. You really get a lot for the corner of Sahara and Eastern, next to a 7-11!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. Fresh pressed juices of all types and really good paninis. Everything is natural and organic. I always order the green juice and pesto chicken sandwich. I personally think it's one of my favorite places to go to ! Must try the papaya orange and grapefruit juice. Very clean and friendly staff. Been going here for a long time now"}
{"text":"A 3.5 star, the ice cream portions are nice and big. The juices are great. The snow-cones are too sweet."}
{"text":"Great family owned and operated establishment. The perfect spot to grab a quick bite to eat. The food is amazing! The staff are all very friendly and attentive. They treat you like family. The prices are reasonable! Definitely going to make this a regular place for lunch! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I came back to give this place a try and I remembered why i stopped coming here. Their prices are extremely expensive. 
My boyfriend and I ordered two panini sandwiches and two drinks, and the total came out to be $27.01. My mind was blown away with the total she gave me. Not even at Tropical smoothie charges this much. Almost $30 for non-gourmet panini's."}
