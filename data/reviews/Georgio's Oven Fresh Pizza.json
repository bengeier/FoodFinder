{"text":"I don't know why we take out from here.  I can be waiting for my pizzas only to see them given to younger female.  When I brought this up an was not given an answer."}
{"text":"Ordered in advance and my order was ready on time and was fresh . They have a friendly staff and good food !"}
{"text":"Gionino's is fabulous. Their sauce to cheese ratio is perfect and their crust is delicious! I'm one of those people guilty of usually not eating the crust, but this is one place that I definitely finish the whole thing. Love, love, love!"}
{"text":"We ordered here on March 2nd, We ordered 2 large Calzones, I got use to liking these when I lived in VIrginia,  I decided to order that night I was so craving one.  So we called about 8:30 I put my order in for 2 Calzones and a large salad, told them to remove the tomatoes cause my baby is allergic to them, well the guy said it would be about 45 minutes, we waited an waited, I looked at my phone it was 1 hr 10 min since I called I called them back they said it was on the way.  The restaurant is only 2 blocks from the house.  Well getting to the food when you order a large tossed salad you expect for the items you order in it is all mixed up inside it.  My baby is picky about what he eats to begin with we order that to split it.  When I started getting me some salad out I told him to come here ok salad had everything in it as ordered but the issue with it was the veges we ordered was only laying on top not all through the salad like I was hoping for.  Now on to the Calzones, it had every item in it the only thing was with one of those you expect as much as you pay for it for it to have the ingredients all through it, the last piece I ate was noting but bread and thick at that.  SO if you want a good italian men dont go here you will not get good service at all"}
{"text":"We like the white pizza  the pizza is good. Salads are small. People are nice. We plan to use them again"}
{"text":"I know I know, it's Georgio's what do you expect for a cheap pizza joint? well I ordered a pizza in advance over the phone and they tell me the usual 10-15 minutes. I get there at about the 15 minute mark and tell em' I'm here for a pickup order... they acted like they didn't know anything about it, then they tell me it will be another 15 minutes... ok whatever. as I'm sitting there in the store waiting for my pizza, I notice a dead cockroach lying on the floor. That is gross! I get my food head home and the pizza is hardly even cooked. the dough still tasted raw and you couldn't even pick a slice up without the whole thing just flopping over, due to it being undercooked. so to top it all off, I had to wait another half hour just so I can re-bake their messup. I am well aware of the \"you get what you pay for\" idea, but c'mon people! if you're understaffed, I get it! hire more people if you can't properly handle your work."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  And the staff is incredible,  have ordered from them several times and had only one small issue (I ordered online website went down)  and in one phone call it was easily taken care of.  The food is great, I really recommend the chicken bacon ranch pizza and the meatball sub."}
{"text":"So I go to Georgios pizza and there is 1 guy working. He takes my order and money, goes and does a few other things then starts making the pizza.  I asked him if he was making my pizza and he said yes. I said very politely please wash your hands, I don't want my family sick. He refused saying that his oven is 400 degrees and it kills anything. He should know because he's the manager and he took classes.  So I told him that I teach classes and we always recommend hand washing even if gloves are used.  He yelled a little ran to the register and gave me my money back. I left happy knowing that I will never go there again. I do realize that we don't always know what happens to our food at a restaurant but WHEN you do know you should speak up.  I also know that if he had poop on his hands we would have had fried poop on our pizza. No thank you. Chagrin and Lee Road location."}
{"text":"Try the $6 deep dish.  You can't beat the price and pizza is very good.  Not a big fan of the fresh and ready.  The deep dish could sell for double if they wanted."}
{"text":"The owner has always been very nice and pleasant since the day they opened. You can't beat $5.00 for a large cheese or pepperoni pizza. It's a great deal if you're on a tight budget or broke. It's not a fancy specialty or designer pizza place (which costs 2x 3x more), but decent ok basic quality pie. Not very memorable, but just ok. No complaints at all..."}
{"text":"Nothing was right - zero stars.
Ordered for delivery - person on the phone was was rude and got the order 
wrong. Pizza dough wasn't cooked at all, cheap cheap toppings. Pizza wasn't even cut, and the drink even was the wrong one. Would've been better off not eating at all. 
Don't get it."}
{"text":"I ordered from here today, the food was ok but all the dough seemed undercooked and too doughy (cheese sticks and calzone) The fried oreos? Skip it, over fried or something gross, look up the dessert and youll see pics of it. This looked all black on the outside not brownish/cookie colored, the oreo was mushy inside. 

The first oreo Ive had that taste WORSE with milk.

SCAM ALERT: They told me 18.50 on the phone. When he got here he was very quick to take my money and a receipt was in the bag. Including delivery it was 15.50.

*The reason I went two years without ordering from here was bc a driver pulled some bs with me last time. He said he had no change at all. No change? Forced to tip him 5.50 instead of the 3 I planned. 

STAY AWAY."}
{"text":"Currently under new Management and there is a huge difference in both service, delivery and quality of Pizza.  I had stopped ordering for a long time but they had some fantastic specials so I thought I would give them a try. In the past few months I have placed several orders and I do not have any complaints. The prices are much better than competitors and the service is great."}
{"text":"I love Georgio's pizza. Five bucks for a fresh and ready (which are never ready). They don't make cheese fresh and ready's because they just don't have the demand, which is understandable, but on a busy Friday night you can't make a couple, they're bound to be sold. 

The employees are complete jerks who are more concerned about moping around than actually working. It's not a glamorous job but it's pizza. How hard can it be??"}
{"text":"Pizza was cooked perfectly. Flavorful crispy crust. I was disappointed with my pepperoni and mushroom pizza. The mushrooms were canned, I had to pick them all off they were so terrible. My pepperoni was placed under my cheese unlike the other pizza we ordered that had good crispy pepperoni all over. I probably won't order from here again."}
{"text":"Get in, get out fast. Their hot and ready pizza options include cheese only and pepperoni. 

And at $5 and $6 the price is right. 

This location is take out only, surrounded by free parking"}
{"text":"I'm not sure that I've ever had an all around dissapointing pizza experience like this before. 

First, the sites online ordering cart is obviously outdated, and it wasn't accepting my email address on my phone, so I had to open up a laptop to complete the process. Minor annoyance, but that was strike 1.

Next I had the driver called me asking what city I was in. I went back to review my order and my address was complete and there. Not sure why they wouldn't have that info in their system. Again, minor annoyance, but it made me start wondering about if this was an unorganized organization not getting common, simple things right.

Next the driver could not find my house, though was parked right in front of it on the street. My house was lit up like a Christmas tree and I could see he was looking at a maps app on his phone. He had to call me again. Again, minor annoyance, but I was noticing a trend.

So, at this point I had lowered my expectations for the quality of the food and just would be happy with an average warm pizza. Unfortunately, average wasn't my experience, nor was warm. I had ordered 2 cheesy breads for my 3 young kids, which comes with red dipping sauce. I only received 1 sauce in 1 of the 2 boxes. I tried a stick and really didnt care for it. I am not a picky eater, so this is saying a lot coming from me.

Next I had ordered  a small deluxe pizza for myself. I was very excited for it, as Georgios seemed to have good Yelp reviews. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. First, they didn't cut the pizza! This is Step 2 in the how-to-make-a-pizza cookbook right after Step 1 to cook it. 

Next the ingredients were average or below average. I didn't think the veggies were overly fresh, but weren't bad. I didn't care for the sausage at all. Lastly, the pizza was undercooked. You could see it. I had to put it in the oven for 10 minutes to cook it. I had to cook my delivered pizza!!!!!!!!!!!

Needless to say I'll never order from here again. I wanted to balance out the few good posts with this negative one. It's really hard to mess up a pizza in my opinion, and Georgios did it at every turn. That's a $25 lesson!"}
{"text":"Good pizza!  I order takeout a lot and not a bad wait time.  If I wanted a large pizza some of them are made already and at a good price."}
{"text":"For the price (very inexpensive), Georgio's makes for a great deal. At the time of review, $5 secured one large single-topping pie -- consequently making me one largely happy customer. The low cost notwithstanding, my pizza was fresh, flavorful. The sauce was distinguishable; the mushrooms were yummy and cooked to my satisfaction. The staff was also friendly and prepared my pizza in a timely fashion. Feeling hungry for a quick, satisfying, and inexpensive pizza? Look no further than Georgio's on Highland."}
{"text":"I'm torn about Georgio's. It looks good, the price is great, it's not greasy, the products are fresh, it's convenient, the people are nice, but it was just OK for me. I think it comes down to the sauce. It was just kind of bland. I'm a girl who makes her own pizza and rarely to never orders out for it, but it just wasn't what I was hoping for.

Where as my other yelper who wrote a 3000 word ode to the dough, I really think a great sauce makes a great pizza, and this isn't cutting it. 

With that said the price ($10 for a large with whatever toppings you want) can't be beat. And the garden salad wasn't bad either. I do wish they made their own ranch. Pizza places always have the best homemade ranch. For the price it's great."}
{"text":"I've always liked this place since it opened years ago. Left the state for about 5 year and came back and it's like nothing has changed. Same good owner and decent food for a good price! I've been to other Georgio restaurants, but I feel this one is definitely the best! Small, but the good service makes up for not being as big as others."}
{"text":"Somebody please retrain the new guy.
Normally my pizza is good but my pizza last night had WAY TOO MUCH sauce on it. What a mess. Wheather accident or on purpose you put your job and the owners investment in jeopardy.
I'll think twice before ordering again from Georgios."}
{"text":"Just got a fresh and ready pepperoni and found 2 what I can only perceive as pubes on the pizza.  I will never go to this georgio's again!  Taking it back and expect a refund."}
{"text":"Hey, when you buy pizza you get what you pay for.  For 5 bucks you get a decent large pepperoni pizza.
If you want a better pizza, order more toppings.  
I appreciate the 5 dollar deal for those of us on a budget.

I walked in the other day for the first time.  Nice guy at the counter took my order for a large pepperoni.  Had my pizza hot and fresh within 10 minutes.  I really appreciated that they have a large container of pepper seeds at the counter that I sprinkled on my pizza to kick it up.  :-)

Clean store and clean restroom.

Thanks!"}
{"text":"If you're not looking for good pizza,  and looking for national chain cheap pizza then look no further. Is it better than papa Johns or domino's? Who cares?"}
{"text":"Hot-n-Ready pizza place at the corner of cedar and warrensville. Pizza quality isnt special, but on a budget and need the quick fix this is the place. 

Great service. Never a long wait. The owner is a really nice and down to earth kinda guy. 

No five stars because it is chain Hot-n-Ready pizza. If you want specialty home-made pizza go around the corner to Geraci's."}
{"text":"I called to verify delivery time, after 45-60min delivery was emailed. They assured me it was only going to be 25-30 min(would have canceled and ordered elsewhere if they didn't lie to keep the business)..... I'm here waiting after an hour and starving. I'm sure it will be cold and stale at the point."}
{"text":"Nope. Not again. Prices were cheap but overpriced for the food. Poor quality food and service."}
{"text":"Very Good!!!  I bought the cheesy bread, only $5 and worth every penny.  A great pizza and breadsticks."}
{"text":"Best $4.99 large Pepperoni pizza around! If you want a cheap pizza that doesn't taste like a cheap pizza then Georgio's is the place for you.  The sauce and crust are great.  I wish they added more cheese but I can understand at $4.99 price they really cant.  For a guy who worked in the Pizza industry and a guy who loves pizza. this place has great value.  Their Jojo's/potato wedges are pretty good as well and are only 2.50 for a large order.  This location does a good job which is why it gets 5 stars.  I've been to the one in Parma and they must not wash their pans enough because their pans leave black crumbs on the bottom of their pizza which is gross. This location I have never noticed this which helps me to believe I am eating clean food."}
{"text":"Never has the Fresh and Ready ever actually been ready. Should say ready in 7-11 minutes. That would be factual. I guess they don't want to make them unless asked which defeats the purpose of calling it READY! Also, the one guy has no people skills. You literally just feel unwelcome and uncomfortable as soon as you walk in. If my kid would eat any other pizza, I'd literally never order from here. Only after 3 bad experiences am I finally posting a review. The girl who works here is really nice, though."}
{"text":"Although I try and go to locally owned places instead of chains Georgio's is one of my favorite chains. I use to order all the time from here and had a few problems here and there but the staff is always friendly. Now that more local businesses have been opening up I've been coming here less and less but the pizza is still good"}
{"text":"Ordered off of yelp. Took 1 hour and 35 minutes for a small plain and wings. Pizza was not good. Wings were ok."}
{"text":"Fresh, quick, delicious.  My favorite pizza place.  I've eaten some pizza in my day, believe me.  I'll be coming back for more.  And more."}
{"text":"I love the phrase \"Due to the current economic climate...\" Nowadays, you can use it as an excuse to get out of nearly anything. Sorry, can't go to your wedding. You know, due to the economic climate. Racquetball on Thursday? Well, it's either pay for gym dues or get an oil change. Due to the current economic whatnot. 

My friends and I used to order from this place all the time back in the day, but due to the current economic climate, we basically have reverted to college days: making our own pizza, and drinking cheap, vile beer. 

That said, this is always my first choice for ordering out pizza in Lakewood. I'm not sure why. Maybe it's because it's the Goldilock's porridge of take-out pizza: not too bad, not mind-blowingly great, but good, consistent (and cheap) pizza. 

Now, due to the current economic climate, excuse me while I make a pair of pants out of an old potato bag."}
{"text":"Great for the price! We get these anytime we are in a rush. We have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Better off buying a frozen pizza and baking it yourself.  It'll be cheaper and tastier than this place."}
{"text":"The selection of toppings on the pizzas are amazing. I felt as though the customer service went above and beyond to make me feel special. The owner, a young man named Tommy, gave me exceptional service and could honestly be a stand up comedian because he is the most witty individual I have ever met. He remembers my wife's name every time she comes in and goes above and beyond to give her a great deal. My kids always beg to go to this location to hear a joke and receive the best pizza in Richmond heights. Richmond Heights is known for sadness and not very good pizza. This place is the exception."}
{"text":"This place went from ok to terrible with the new owners. The pizza's take at least an hour to show up, they always show up cold. They never give extra cheese or sauce even when ordered. The order takers barely speak English and get the orders wrong. They fight you on correcting their mistakes. The wings are tiny and poorly made. The salads are warm and the list of complaints keep going. Do not waste your money on this place it is terrible. I would give it minus 5 stars if I could. Once we order just 2 orders of wings. After an hour and a half we called them and just said to cancel the order, which they said they had not made, and the manger was swearing at me. He refused to to give us a refund and I had to call the police just to get them to put the money back on my card. Even the police could not believe how the manger was acting. If you are smart, find another business to deal with. These guys are terrible."}
{"text":"1/2 of my order was good and the other was terrible. No complaints about the pizza; it was fresh, hot, and delivered quickly. Boneless wings on the other hand...what a joke. $7.50 FOR 8 SOGGY MICROWAVED WINGS!! Pathetic"}
{"text":"Best things about this place :
1. Fresh and Amazing Pizza`s
2. Chicken wings were good with Fancy sauce"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza for the price. Pizza was a little cold. I had to nuke it."}
{"text":"I'm still fairly new to the area but I come from a big city where the pizza is priced right and always tastes good. Been ordering here for months now. I like their supreme & BBQ chicken pizza! For the price, it's good & they always deliver before the time estimated."}
{"text":"This Georgio's Oven Fresh Pizza Co. Location is among the nicer store.  The service and quality are great."}
{"text":"Garbage. DO NOT order from these people. On their menu they charge $12 for a large calzone, which is shit by the way- first time ordering it, and when the driver came it was $16.49 plus a $5 tip so I thought I was going to get a very large amazing calzone and I received a little bullsh*t calzone not even worth $10. Stay away from these idiots."}
{"text":"Good pizza nice and hot.i  love the cozones. Can't can't to try the s'mores. Looks pretty good to me."}
{"text":"I was completely blown away by the total lack of customer service and unprofessional-ism on display here. Here's the scoop. I often order pizza online and never have an issue so I thought I would try here as there was a good deal. I placed the order online and completely paid for it as well at 9:37 pm they close at 11. I received a confirmation email with a delivery time so I thought all was good. I waited upwards of an hour and a half ( I had asked for one well done) before calling the store. Got no answer. Pizza never came. Called this morning when they opened and asked for a manager. The man who answered said he would not get the manager until I called from an unblocked number. Really? I explained this is my cell and my only number. I wouldn't give in and finally said well I need my money back for my pizza that never came last night. He told me he that I could come pick up cash. I said well I want that refunded to my card and he told me it will take 10 days and I may not ever get it. REALLY? I asked again when the manager will be in, at this point he said he was the manager. He told me they were \"cheap\" and didn't want to upgrade the computers and that they got my order at 11 this am.  I guess I will now have to drive there to get my money back because the manager is completely ridiculous. Save yourself the hassle and get something else. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Without good dough, it will never be a good pizza. 

This is an unconventional review, but that's the breaks.  Most of you will stop reading within the next few seconds.  I get it.  Hope that you enjoy the next review---whether cupcakes or office supplies.  All the others willing to peruse further---maybe two or three of you---will understand where I'm coming from.  I can't be the ONLY one who does what I do---or has at least thought of doing it.  

I'm reviewing this Georgio's for the very basis of all pizzas---the starting point...the underpinning---from Naples Italy, to Brooklyn New York, to Brooklyn Ohio.  Without this all-important element, it's nothing more than a melange of assorted seasonings, herbs, vegetables, and proteins.   It's the foundation of all pizzas---the honorable disk of flour and water---the crust. 
      
Once upon a time I made my own deep-dish style, inspired by the esteemed Uno's and Due's out of Chicago, and not far from my place of employment.  Years later---and after moving back to the Land of the Cleve's---my beloved parlor opened at Great Northern Mall in North Olmsted.  Magnifico!   But alas---an all-too-brief appearance.  Once again, I was left depressed and pizza-par-excellence-deprived.  Making from scratch again wasn't appealing from a few standpoints---especially fitting it into my busy schedule.  So, I tried one pizza joint and then another.  None ever quite filled the Numero Uno's boots.  

Complete-and-ready-to-heat from those who spend hundreds of thousands on TV commercials was soon put out for the Coonies in a near-by park.  Went the frozen unbaked dough route, and even the unfrozen! clear-bagged already-baked ready-for-add-on's suspended from hooks! to add my own toppings to.  Nothing was working.  What was I going to do when I wanted a really good pizza?  It wasn't something I HAD to have, but it would be comforting, and put my mind to rest, if I had one in my back pocket for any sudden pie urge.

Ti amo tanto, GEORGIO !   And so close---in North Olmsted !  Normally, I quickly dispose of most general advertising that's dropped into my mailbox.  But, as fortune would have it, my eyes lingered upon a flier that offered a plain pizza at a very good price.  At the time, I think it was 5.99.  A Fresh-'N-Ready.  You could add pepperoni or sausage at no extra charge.   I had found the holy grail of baked pie dough that I could personally embellish.  

Grazie. . .grazie molto !

I always stock onions, garlic , olive oil, dried herbs (fresh, in season), various cheeses, tomatoes---both canned and fresh, banana peppers, fresh mushrooms, even anchovies.  I'm well-prepared.  And, if any other variations sound appealing, a quick trip to the local market is easy enough.  My \"very own pizza pie ala Georgio's\"---a take on Food Network's Semi-Homemade---was an instant hit, and has had several tasty episodes.  There's a favorite that I love replaying, however, in memory of Uno's. . .
A vegetarian style that I've altered slightly:   sauteed sliced baby eggplant, roasted red pepper, feta, parmesan, mozzarella, garlic, good quality jarred pizza sauce (on the side for dunking), and oil-packed marinated artichokes (patted dry).  

Of the dozens of excellent, simply-prepared Georgio plain pizzas, only one had a crust that needed a little attention.  A light sprinkling of olive oil tuned it up perfectly, and it was soon ready for detailing.  

I can't speak of their specialty pizzas, but I HIGHLY recommend their wonderful basic sauce and cheese pie.    

Ciao."}
