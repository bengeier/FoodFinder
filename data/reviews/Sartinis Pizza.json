{"text":"If you love a good greasy pizza like I do then try Sartini's out. They have a nice tangy sauce which I loved. The pepperoni is thick and the ham is awesome, seriously it's the best ham I have had on a pizza. I admit I never tried the previous shops pizza so I can't compare but I do like this pizza a lot."}
{"text":"Grab n go was the best $5 pizza place but considering it costs now me $2 more for a donatos pizza, this is no longer my weekly go-to. I was bummed to see grab n go changed their name, but \"sartini\" delivered me the same pizza for about a month. Suddenly it is twice, the price and half as good."}
{"text":"Terrible.  The bar they own on the same block serves this and its BAD.  All dough.  No seasoning and tastes like cardboard.  Don't care how cheap it is.  Fine an online coupon and at least get Papa Johns or Little Skeezers..."}
{"text":"If I was rating the food alone I would give Sartinis 5 stars. But they have major problems with their online ordering system. First they have two websites and two delivery systems. One is through beyond menu and the other through toast tab. The beyond menu online menu is not complete. You can't order everything such as making your own calzone. The toast tab menu is confusing and every time we've ordered the calzone we get a pizza delivered. Apparently the restaurant receives the order as a pizza. We've notified them of this problem and it hasn't been fixed. Today when we ordered we put a note in the special instructions to please make this a calzone! The delivery person said it was good that we wrote that because they were going to make us a pizza. They did however still screw up our order by giving us sausage instead of mushrooms. The only reason we're not super upset is that the pizza is really good. I really hope they fix their online ordering system because I'd like to continue to order from here!

EDIT: The restaurant reached out to me and assured me they will fix the issue. I'm confident they will and can't wait to order a calzone again from here!"}
