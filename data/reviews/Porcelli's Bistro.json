{"text":"I enjoyed a wonderful meal at Porcelli's. The drinks were inventive and flavorful. The good was just fantastic. The spaghetti carbonera was the best I have had since Rome. And the price was so reasonable - $60 for 2. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We loved everything from start to finish. We came in with a group and had wonderful service. Each of us enjoyed our dishes. The wine was maybe a little over priced, but the selection was good. The place was empty though... Seems the location is a tough one- places come and go. But I liked it here, hope to go back soon, and I hope it picks up for them. They deserve good business!"}
{"text":"Arrived in Cleveland for a quick weekend getaway and went to Porcelli's based on a Yelp search and reviews.  Fabulous meal!  The food was prepared with such high quality and you could tell the ingredients were of the highest caliber!   I had the Lobster Ravioli and it was scrumptious.  Whether you are visiting or a Cleveland native - this meal is well worth the trip"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken piccata, finished it under ten minutes. And they let my dog sit with me :)"}
{"text":"I was really hoping this place was going to be fantastic as we live a few blocks away and eat out pretty often, but we were unfortunately disappointed.   The service was not great- our server didn't seem to know much about the preparations of the food/specials, wine, etc., but we attributed that to the fact that the restaurant had just opened a few weeks ago and thought we'd let it slide.  Our appetizers arrived in a semi-reasonable amount of time, but we then waited a ridiculous amount of time for our entrees. We noticed tables that had arrived after us had already received their food, so we asked our server the status of our food for the 2nd or 3rd time. Finally she told us it was still going to be a while and by this point, we were running late for an event so we ended up having to take the food to go. Delays happen- having worked in a restaurant before, I know that- but at no point did anyone really make any attempt to apologize for the delay. The food (now take-out style) was decent, but the service and wait were enough to make us hesitate to visit this place again."}
{"text":"I will start by saying I've never been to the downtown location--which is definitely on my short list.   Overall, my first experience at this new location was just OK. It wasn't bad--I wasn't wowed either. The service was... a little strange, but not all that bad. Although there was one waitress who was really, really loud--but she was a sweetheart.   We just ordered some simple apps, no main dishes or pasta. That was a mistake I'm guessing, after reading the other reviews. The caprese salad was just OK. You could tell the tomatoes had been refrigerated because they were super cold and bland. I know it's not exactly the height of tomato season, but I've found some good ones, still. We also ordered the stuffed peppers. The flavor was there, but the look of the dish was really unappealing. It almost ruined the dish, but taste always rules--at least in my world. I will say that the sauce, although there wasn't a lot on the peppers, was really rich and delicious. This tells me a classic marinara dish on there menu would be a good choice.   Again, I'm not judging too harshly because I didn't really try the main courses, but I think the lighter bites on the menu could use a little umph. I'd probably come back to give the full menu a try."}
{"text":"I'm excited to be the first reviewer of the new Porcelli's Bistro in the Tremont area of Cleveland! It's so new that it doesn't have it's own website or phone # listed yet anywhere on the web. If you want to get an idea, check out the website listed for Porcelli's at their longtime E. 6th St. location downtown. Porcelli's Bistro in Tremont is located where The Bistro on Lincoln Park used to be situated. It's brand new (only been open about 2 weeks), so they may still be working out the kinks, but we had a wonderful dinner there!  The ambiance/setting: I love the decor here - very stylish, but comfortable. There's a bar where you can just sit & have a drink. There are three separate eating areas, all nicely decorated with a muted Italian theme. Oh, there's an outdoor patio on the front that overlooks Lincoln Park.   The food: It was so hard to choose - everything looked delicious!! There were a couple of specials listed up on the board and my sis-in-law tried one - a mixed seafood cioppino (stew w/ some pasta) that was very tasty. We had the baked brie as an appetizer - yum! All entrees come with a really nice salad - fresh & tasty. The menu has some meals (per our server) that are the same as downtown, but there's many more different, interesting items - I think!. My niece got a pasta dish with a lobster cream sauce - wow. There were so many interesting seafood/fish dishes I wanted to try, but I ended up getting a pasta carbonara dish w/ pancetta that was delicious. I know it was good because the others that I was with kept reaching across the table and trying my dish!  The drinks: A nice selection of wines, drink specials and beer. I had an Italian red wine that was great!  The staff: The waitstaff and bartender are friendly, personable, capable and very efficient. I know that at least some of them have also worked/currently work at Porcelli's on E. 6th so they know the menu quite well. If they don't, they're very willing to go find out the info from the chef!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped for a bite to eat at Porcelli's. all I have to say is AMAZING!! Even had the chef come out to ask us how the food was. I being Sicilian, know my food, my girlfriend, loved it, I loved it, and hopefully Porcelli's will be around for a long time to come."}
{"text":"My husband and I had an extraordinary meal from start to finish! The happy hour was reasonably priced and very good with a lot of selections. Our server suggested a perfect glass of wine to go with our selections. We ended up having entr√©es (we had planned on only happy hour) because the menu had so many appealing choices. We plan to take our guests from out of town here in a few weeks!   We would recommend the bar area if just having happy hour and the dining room if looking for a quiet, romantic evening meal."}
{"text":"Dined at Porcellis within 2 weeks of its opening. Fantastic experience. Love the homey decor. Informative waiters. Best filet dish I've had since I can remember! Wine a tiny pricey and small portioned. Otherwise loved it. Highly recommend!"}
