{"text":"Awful!!!! My boyfriend got a couples message package through Just Because Message and when we called to schedule we were told that they no longer do couples messages but that we could have separate messages. We proceeded to schedule separate messages and when I attempted to show up for my appointment no one was at the address and it didn't even look like a business. We attempted to call repeatedly to reschedule or get our money back but no one ever responded. Total ripoff, DO NOT BUY A GROUPON or attempt to go to Just Because Message because you will never get your message!"}
{"text":"This business was difficult to contact.  I called and left 2 voice mail messages and sent an email before I was finally contacted by the owner several days later.  They discriminated against my boyfriend because he has a medical condition that was cleared by his doctor.  Groupon refunded my money.  Somewhat unprofessional!"}
{"text":"When I got there, I found out her location was in a really bad area where I saw homeless looking people or gangster walking on the street. But I decided to stay and give it a shot. What a bad decision. I don't know where she received her massage education. She evidently didn't how what she was doing. She talked a lot but kept massaging the wrong areas and tried to upsell me her other service. I paid for one hour and could barely stand her for another minute. I left after only 35 minutes. I would give zero star if I could."}
