{"text":"I would say this is the best bbq around, of course I've only been here once. The brisket is so tender and sliced thin. Atmosphere not to write home about but, hey, it's a bbq place."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, fast service and great food. I stopped in with my boyfriend for lunch. We got a couple sandwiches. The pork butt the other was beef brisket. We also enjoyed the pulled pork egg rolls and they were terrific. The server put a bottle of BBQ sauce on our table and we used it with everything. Sandwiches, fries and egg rolls. Try this place, you'll be glad you did!!"}
{"text":"Wife and I just tried Smoke for the first time. It was rwally good. The Brisket had an awesome smoke taste. We tried the Brisket appetizer and it was simply the best i ever had. Worth the visit by itself. They need to add it onto the menu. The only reason im not giving it a 5 is...The ribs are pretty bad. Im a BBQ professional. Lol ok close but the ribs are not worthy to be sold here. Its time to change them up. Take pride in your ribs. They are simply bad. EVERYTHING else is spot on..give Smoke a try.   P.S. if you cannot make a really good rib take them off the menu. Real rib lovers will NOT like these.   Try the BRISKET...AMAZING."}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant while visiting my family in Ohio, as I grew up right on Bacon Road.  The interior of the restaurant hasn't changed since the the first time I visited in the 90's (then a pizza place by the name of Mr. P's), so that was a bit of nostalgia I enjoyed.  And that was where the fun ended.  I ordered The Roast Beast, which is essentially a French Dip, and macaroni and cheese with bacon for an additional upgrade.  The sandwich was presented on a sesame seed hamburger bun, which was unimpressive, but the absolute lack of taste was the deal breaker.  It had none.  The meat was bland, there was hardly any (shredded) cheese on the sandwich, and the au jus tasted like it was made by boiling ten gallons of water and adding in one beef bullion cube.  The macaroni and cheese was orange, and clearly not made from real cheese.  It looked a bit like Kraft mac and cheese, but had even LESS taste.  I would have been more satisfied with Kraft.    Worst restaurant food ever, and I'm no food snob.  I prefer literally everything I've ever had in any kind of restaurant establishment, even fast food, over this place.  If you're stuck in that particular area, the food at the convenience store/gas station right next door (RediGo) is better.  By a lot.  My friend liked the riblets she ordered, but I left feeling like I flushed $30 down the toilet.  The service, at least, was very good."}
{"text":"Great customer service, with even better food! Can't wait to see then at the Painesville Party in the Park next week!"}
{"text":"Wonderful establishment. Their menu, service, ambiance and food are amazing.  We go here regularly and every time it is perfect.  I recommend the mash potato pizza as an appetizer, the pulled pork burrito is an amazing dinner.    The owner greets everyone and spends hours smoking the meats. It is a wonderful place for lunch, dinner and takeout."}
{"text":"Really good BBQ! Barbeque is an art form, and Smoke does a great job. Everybody has their own view as to what BBQ should be, and in my opinion, Smoke offers a very tasty northern style BBQ. Good smokey flavor, nice rub, and a slightly sweet and tangy sauce.   As part of my career, I have traveled all around America, and one of my hobbies is trying BBQ while traveling, so I consider myself an non official expert amateur BBQ sampler. Smoke BBQ ranks in my personal top 10.   We live close to this restaurant, and have eaten there at least once a month for the last 2 years. Obviously I like the BBQ at this joint, but what makes a restaurant good is the consistency of the food,  of the service, value, and of the cleanliness. Smoke BBQ is consistently good in all of those categories.   The menu features a variety of Smoked BBQ meats, ribs, riblets, brisket, etc. which are all smoked in house, by the owner, Jim. The menu also offers surprisingly good pizza, of which they usually offer a rotating gourmet style speciality. The crust tastes homemade and is crispy, and the toppings are fresh and generously applied. Another item that we have tried are are the burgers. Again, freshly made, nicely sized, and delicious.   The side dishes are quite generously sized. (I know I keep using generously, but it's true! Try the house made chips, you get a small mountain of them. the french fries with rosemary are the same way!)   Another cool thing they do is offer Smoked hams and turkeys for the holidays. We got a smoked ham for Christmas, and it was incredible! They offer a different cut than you get at the grocery store, tender, delicious, and unique.   Lastly, service has Been first rate on every visit, friendly and attentive.   So to sum things up, Great Q, nice size portions, consistent food quality, and service. Nice variety of non Q offerings on the menu, and an overall good value.   Food Giants rating system;  5* = Freakin' Great. 4* = Really Darn Good.  3* = sure, why not, 2*= it's better than starving, 1* = A hungry homeless person, after one bite,  wouldn't eat this, even if you gave it to them for free. (Although you should still offer it to them) No Stars = Ptomaine Tillie's foodborne pathogen Diner. (Yes the P is silent in Ptomaine)  Food Quality: **** Portion Size:  **** Service:          **** Menu:             **** Uniqueness:   *** Atmosphere:  ** Cleanliness:   **** Value:             ****  Its great to be able to patronize an independent small business, that offers great food at a good value. Please support these types of businesses."}
{"text":"Worst baby back ribs ever I could barely pry them off the bone with a fork and the baked potato was no better  it was my first and last time there and the prices where more then Longhorn and Roadhouse if I could give them a negative 5 star rating I would !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good bbq....had the combo plate and Mac n cheese....ribs and brisket were excellent!  Sauce was good and meat not swimming in it!  Pulled pork was good but I got a small bone in my pork...not a huge issue, but not a good thing...cautiously ate the remaining pork.  It was good but a tad bit dry...good flavor though.  I will definitely go back and will recommend this place to friends....price point was really good..."}
{"text":"Somethings changed...there is very little (if any) smoke flavor to the pulled pork now and I don't think there was any sauce on the two pounds we bought for carry out.  It was also charred a lot - like maybe a newbie thought char means BBQ? - not fatty though so that's still good.   This place always had a great lil vibe - good beans, solid corn dusted breads, interesting and tasty specials like the pulled pork pasta and the yummy appetizers - I hope whatever changed changes back as I hate the thought that I go pay to pick up BBQ just to come home and slather it in Sweet Baby Rays or some Memphis style sauce...it shouldn't need it.    I will def give it one more shot as we've had many great meals here one can be off but I am seeing other reviews that mention a change of ownership...that makes me wonder if this was a fluke or if my days picking up SMOKE are numbered."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant! Eat there at least every other week.  My husband is hooked on their WHOLE wings.  I love the brisket (LITERALLY melts in your mouth). My four children and their friends love the Big Butt Pulled Pork Sandwiches.  The fries are seasoned with Rosemary and quite a treat!  Try Smoke and you'll be a regular!!"}
{"text":"Love the homemade chips with rosemary.   I've enjoyed the pulled pork as well as the brisket.  Everything I hsve tried has been delicious.   I also like their pulled pork pizza.  We try to make it here at les st once every month or so."}
{"text":"Today was one of those Murphy's Law kind of days for me. Trouble travels in threes so they say. And dinner tonight was the third in the lousy chain of events that happened to me. Let me tell you all about it.  I've been to this restaurant before, just never reviewed it. My previous trips were fabulous and on point. As soon as you set foot in the door, you are enrobed in the glorious aroma of  BBQ smoked meaty goodness. You can smell it blocks away. It even makes this vegetarian salivate!   Maybe it was the sign outside the door that said \"Cook Wanted\" that should have raised the red flags. But, hunger always wins and on our way inside my husband and I went.   We were seated promptly, though it took awhile to even get a drink. Our salad and appetizer of BBQ brisket flatbread came out about 15 minutes later. It was tasty but undercooked. After about 20 minutes into putting our order in for the BBQ brisket dinner and a mashed potato pizza, we were informed that the pizza oven wasn't working. It was taking a long time because it had to be made in the regular oven. A solid 35 minutes into waiting and then watching the people who came in after us get served before us, my patience was nil.   The pizza finally arrived, at the 40 minute mark. Of course it was a soggy mess. The brisket dinner was room temperature, with hot beans for good measure. I sent the pizza right back, only to be told that \"the pizza oven was now working\". The waitress really could have kept that fact to herself at that point. Sorry your kitchen staff can't get it together. We promptly packed up our food and left. The pizza was taken off the bill, but nothing else was comped in any way.   Now, I could have stuck around and raised a big stink, got the manager involved, blah, blah. But honey, after the crap shoot of a day I had, I just didn't have the energy to feed more vampires. All I wanted to do was go home.   So, in conclusion, Smoke really, truly does have amazing BBQ foods. They are worth checking out. I'll give them another chance somewhere down the distant road. And I'll be sure to ask if their pizza oven is working before I order."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  It's out of the way, but a real gem in an otherwise unnoticed strip mall.  The food was excellent and the portions large.  I loved it!!!"}
{"text":"The riblets are to die for! Also love their Bacon MAC & Cheese and the Chili Cheese Fries."}
{"text":"Small place.  Not a ton of atmosphere. But, very good food. Excellent texture to the meat. Only one sauce but a good sauce a little sweet tiny bit of tang. Reasonable price. Riblets (good portion).14$ with potatoe and slaw. Pulled pork burrito with tons of fries 9$. Personally thought it was better than oak and embers if that gives you a baseline."}
{"text":"Stopped in here over the weekend with the hubby, 1st time visiting. We shared a bowel of the Brunswick stew & both got the combo platters so we could have a sampling of the different meats/sides. The stew was very good, sweet but very layered in flavor and hearty. The dinner platters were very large, not lacking in size at all. The meats were very good as were the sides. Our complaint was that the meat on both plates were barely warm, the pulled pork was room temp (bordering being cold), yet the sides were piping hot. We had the bacon mac & cheese- very cheesy and good. The fries- good seasoned with rosemary, huge amount, the baked beans- good tasting, but a little on the dry side and the slaw- this  was a let down, definitely tasted like GFS coleslaw, which I like but not when I'm going to a BBQ joint. When the server finally came over ( only girl working the room that night...being saturday)to check on us we had already eaten half our food but did mention that while everything tasted good the meat was next to cold. She apologized and said she would let the kitchen know to leave the meat on the grill a little longer. Now, you would think the owner who kept popping out of the kitchen onto the floor would come over and address that issue...an apology, a free dessert perhaps....nope, nothing. He selectively walked around the the dining room and asked people how their food was, never once us! All in all $65.00 w/tip, dinner and 2 drinks. A little pricey for partially cold food. We decided we would give them another try again sometime when we are in the area. My favorite was the ribs."}
{"text":"Always good service....we go here about every 2 weeks. Get the riblet dinner....the service and food was iffy at the startup...but it is fine now, and a favorite of the community..."}
{"text":"Ordered the burnt end appetizer, there was so much fat on it it was inedible. Waitress was kind enough to reorder and I heard her specifically ask the chef for a piece with less fat.  The second burnt end which is more like boneless beef rib and it was worse than the first one. I would not recommend this restaurant.  The only reason I am giving it one star is the service."}
{"text":"The family and I went to this place over the weekend.  It was fantastic.  I got the brisket plate...  it came with a large portion of brisket with BBQ sauce, and 2 sides.  Brisket had a good smokey flavor, tender, and delicious.  We also ordered the homemade potato chips as a appetizer.  It came out on a giant platter and were awesome.  They had a touch of rosemary and salt on them.  The place is small and we arrived just before the dinner rush.  When we left there was a line out the door."}
{"text":"I have to agree with some of the previous reviews that the place isn't as good as it was. Been here quite a few times and it was always good. Today, was a different story. Took forever to get drinks. I chalked that up to it being very busy, which I thought was a good sign. The pulled pork egg rolls we ordered as appetizers were really bad. The few pieces of pulled pork that were inside tasted like they've been around for a few weeks. And the rolls themselves were chewy and greasy. The coleslaw that came with it as garnish tasted like it came out of a cooler that lost its power a while back. The dish was so bad we decided to call it a day right there. What a shame. This used to be one of my favorite barbecue places"}
{"text":"Meat was just ok. I had the combo dinner. It had pulled pork (about a cup), 3 ribs and  brisket (good amount) for $18.00. All the meats were way over cooked and ribs were burnt. I like a good bark but these were way past that point. Also tried the mac-n-cheese with bacon sounds great right? Yeah not so much noodles were over boiled and still had water inside them. Had the coleslaw that was definitely store bought. And the baked beans were really dry. Good flavor but dry. Sweet tea was out of a bag in box and for a \"BBQ\" place sweet tea should be made fresh everyday. We paid for four people and it was $92.00. A bit steep I think and I don't mind at all paying that for food if it's actually good. Wife had a pork sandwich, friend had combo dinner and his wife had riblets they had sodas with their meals. Bbq sauce was ok, wish they had more options. Comments from friends were that it was just ok.  I think they definitely could improve and have the potential to do so. I don't mean for this to be a bad review, I just want people to be aware and if the owner or workers read this to not give up but to work harder at it. Good luck."}
{"text":"Small family run BBQ  food is very good. I really like the Rosemary fries I am not a fry guy but make a point to order when I go. I had the sampler,  ribs, pork and brisket with fries and baked beans. The brisket had a lot of fat but the meat I did get was delicious. My wife ordered the same and her brisket was meaty and tender.  Ribs had great smoke flavor as well as the shredded pork and brisket.  They do not only have smoked items they also have pizza. I keep saying I will try it but once  I walk in and smell the smoke and I am hooked on meat.  Our table of four Ordered Long Islands which the waitress said were the best around.  Will not order again  they were decent but not exceptional.  Service was a little slow for the amount of people in the place but we were not in a hurry so did not mind.  It seems like we always forget about this place maybe it is the location but If you want some good BBQ don't forget about Smoke"}
{"text":"So disappointed in our meal on Saturday.  I kept thinking about BBQ & picked your restaurant.  Have not been there since the new owners took over.  Pulled pork sandwich had no - NONE - smoked flavor.  My 24 year old son said it was like someone found some meat and threw a little BBQ sauce on it.  His words:  WORST BBQ I'VE EVER EATEN.  Husband has the same dinner - said it was flavorless.  My full rib dinner - well the biggest potato I think I've ever seen.  Asked for more butter & sour cream which never came.  Girl did offer more ice tea several times.  I think It was the water - it did not taste right.  It wasn't bad - on its way out - but was not right.  Am not sure what was wrong with it.  The ribs - the meaty part of the bone was tough and did not \"fall off the bone\"  you tugged to get  it.  Burned top - seemed like they were cooked and BBQ and ready to serve and then through back k on the grill to warm with more sauce.   Meal was rushed - sat down; got the tea, served my salad and before I was 1/3 of the way done with the salad the meal was served.  I did not say anything that night, Saturday 7 April, 2018 because my son does not like that I do.  I have to inform you - perhaps you don't know what's going on in the kitchen.    My son won't go back.  He said after paying over $60.00 to take us to BBQ - he could have stood in the yard and just burned the money.  Same effect.  I'm sorry to have to say his words - but that's how it is.  THANK YOU.  Laura"}
{"text":"Wide variety of menu choices that never disappoint. If you enjoy true smoked BBQ then you will enjoy Smoke. I love the homemade potato chips appetizer and my favorite entrée is the riblets. These are true chunks of pork with no bone. Have dined in on a regular basis since their opening. Service has always been among the best I have ever received. Prices are fair and restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"I have been to Smoke many times and it is always amazing. Today was the absolute best though. This place is always clean and the smoke smell when you walk in is so appetizing. Our server, Lisa, was attentive and suggested a great appetizer! We haven't tried the bacon wrapped burnt ends before but they were phenomenal! I got the smoked brisket sandwich. The brisket itself was cooked to perfection. So juicy and tender. The BBQ sauce they make is also the perfect complement. This is the only place I can never finish my plate as they give you a pound of fries that are so tasty. Great job!"}
{"text":"Short answer - don't bother.  I think this BBQ place recently opened.  My wife and I tried it - I had the combo (ribs, pulled pork, brisket), she had the ribs.  Each dish comes with two sides - I got the baked beans and the green beans.  Frankly, everything was kind of bland.  The BBQ was cooked fine, but between their rub and their BBQ sauce (they only have one sauce) everything was kind of bland and boring.  Same thing with the baked beans; they weren't bad, they just weren't very good.  A BBQ place that doesn't have a good BBQ sauce, why bother."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if they have a new owner or whats going on here. In the past they had excellent food and service. Today 6/28/17 horrible dry bones with hardly any meat and a lousy server to match. This WAS my favorite rib place. After today I will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from friends in the area and had been making plans for an evening out.  This is exactly what I want / expect when I get BBQ. Simple, straightforward, and well-priced. This is now our #1 BBQ restaurant in the Mentor / Painesville area and we'll absolutely be coming back often.  I had the \"Big Butt\" sandwich with no coleslaw and added onion straws with a side of fries. It was fantastic and I cleared my plate. My wife got a Brisket dinner and cleared her plate as well. The BBQ sauce is perfect with everything.  Our two little ones (4 & 2) loved the food as well. The four year old loved her mac & cheese w/ bacon, and two year old loved his little pulled pork sandwich w/ fries."}
{"text":"Great food!  Great service!  My favorite is the Big Butt sandwich!  Always leave this place stuffed full and satisfied! Never yet a bad experience! Nice place for lunch, or to take the family for dinner.   Reasonably priced. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place does need some attention to detail. The food was a little bland and not the greatest. I was more disappointed in the service. It took a while to get our drinks even with 4 workers standing around doing nothing. They def. need to work on the service and spice it up a notch on the food. We may try this place again in a few months and give them another shot."}
{"text":"Hour and a half and still waiting to get a seat. Come to find out there was 21+ ppl who sat before us even though we got there before them. Service is slow and can't clear a table.  What a waste of time. I'll fire up my grill instead.  I don't like giving bad reviews but this one is deserved.  Had a great birthday and awesome 1st time at Smoke.  Glad I drove three hours for this."}
{"text":"This is one of the best BBQ restaurants I have been too.  Everything was fresh & great tasting. Will definitely come back. The bacon wrapped burnt ends were fantastic. The prices were reasonable. Riblets were outstanding."}
{"text":"Best cake! Lemon berry marscapone? cake. Bacon wrapped Burnt ends are a go to every time.  Pulled pork egg rolls are also really good..  but the cake is good."}
{"text":"I have tried the beef brisket a few times and everytime - both with the sandwich and the dinner plate - the meat is very very fatty.  Good service and staff, but food is below average."}
{"text":"I am writing this review after I noticed this restaurant has so few and those written were not favorable. I went there last fall with a group of 6-7 people. Everyone loved the food. The interior was very clean and the decor was simple but welcoming. Service was good but it was not very busy. I would love to go back there again but it is quite a drive from my house and some of my other family members do not like BBQ as much as I do.  It is a locally owned and operated small business that serves good food at a reasonable price. I think it is definitely worth checking out!!"}
{"text":"I know its a BBQ place, but their pizza is amazing! I love their loaded mashed potato pizza, my only complaint about it is that its so good that I accidentally eat the whole thing. I've yet to try any of their actual BBQ stuff, but as a pizza place they're 5 star *****"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with my girlfriend. We each got something and shared it as we usually do. We had the pulled pork egg rolls for an appetizer and I highly recommend you try these. We ordered the Brisket and pork butt sandwiches with fries. The fries were seasoned with rosemary and sea salt. Everything was delicious. We will be back to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"Good food the beef brisket is my favorite along with there bbq sauce its a must try I definitely recommend coming here"}
