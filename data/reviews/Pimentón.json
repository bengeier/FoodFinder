{"text":"I stopped by here the other day for a quick bite for the first time, the paella is excellent.  The rice was crispy, yet still tender and soft with a great flavour to the rice that only paellas can provide.  They even offer cooking classes which I was tempted to look into just because their food tasted so good!"}
{"text":"Pimenton has an Authentic Spanish & Mediterranean feel to it as you step inside this Food shop full of those ethnic decor. Do you need a Paella Pans, Tagines, Olive Oil, Vinegar, Condiments, Cheese, Charcuterie, Spicy Chocolate Powder? 

Maybe a jar of Piri-Piri AFRICAN Chili to make your own special Piri-Piri blend at home? If cooking is not your forte, then maybe take a lesson they teach(Tapas, Paella, etc...). Even better take some Prepared Food home displayed in the glass fridge while the owner/staff work in the back open kitchen behind the shelves. 

It is mostly dedicated to Spanish/Mediterranean with some African items in this nice shop as I looked at the pricey Moroccan Teapots which kind of surprised me slightly. I only had the Callebaut Chocolate Brownie (Gluten Free, $3.50) and to my surprise it was not overly sweet and not super dense like the ones you get off of Convenience Store shelves. A-OK 

It's not really a dine-in style of shop unfortunately as you look at the prepped food and wish to consume on the spot. It's more for taking home and sharing these somewhat exotic and non-regularly consumed goodies.  My Brownie was served on a piece of paper napkin, no biggie."}
